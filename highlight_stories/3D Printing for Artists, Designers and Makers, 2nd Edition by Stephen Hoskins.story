This preface is for those people who have  little  experience  of  3D  printing  and  need  a  clear  description of what the basic processes are and how  they  work.  It  will  also  define  what  I  understand  is  meant by 3D printing.  Before we delve into the history and development  of  3D  printing,  we  need  a  description  of  what  the  process  actually  entails.  First  and  foremost  all  3D  printing  processes  are  additive  by  nature  –  in  other  words, you build up an object by adding material. 3D  printing  is  a  relatively  recent  innovation  that  allows  physical  objects  to  be  fabricated  directly  from  a  3D  virtual model created in computer design software or  by  scanning  the  shape  of  an  existing  object.  In  3D  printing, objects are fabricated by computer-controlled  machinery,  which  deposits  or  solidifies  material,  one  layer  on  top  of  another,  in  a  way  that  could  be  described as analogous to the building of a traditional  coil pot. objects can be built in a range of materials,  including plastics, ceramics and metals. The layer-by- layer fabrication process of 3D printing frees the artist,  designer or engineer from many of the constraints of  traditional fabrication methods – hence the process is  sometimes referred to as ‘solid free-form fabrication’.  Visually oriented artists and designers are beginning  to  explore  the  exciting  aesthetic  possibilities  and  implications of 3D printing as a medium for creative  practice, and the purpose of this book is to provide  an  introduction  to  3D  printing  from  a  visual  arts  perspective.  This  book  introduces  the  historical  and  technological  context  of  3D  printing  and  provides  state-of-the-art case studies from creative practice in  the fine and applied arts, crafts and design.  Chapter  1  will  begin  by  introducing  the  history  of  3D  printing,  paying  particular  attention  to  how  that  history  relates  to  a  visual  arts  context.  It  will  trace  a  dual  path  of  development,  starting  with  James  Watt  and  his  sculpture  copying  machines,  through  developments  in  rendering  maps  in  three  dimensions to a 1950s method of copying sculpture  in an analogue manner. The parallel track follows the  development  of  light  sensitive  gelatine  materials  in   6  PReFACe  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   6  9 26 17   3:39 PM   Tom Lomax, Michael: Angels Series,  2011.  early  Victorian  photography  and  printing  processes,  through  the  development  of  Photosculpture,  to  the  creation of bas-relief printing and into photo-polymeric  emulsions, which finally lead to the photo-initiated 3D  printing  processes.  The  chapter  then  describes  how  visual artists have interfaced with, and then adopted,  the processes to the benefit of artists, designers and  craftspeople.  Chapter  2  outlines  the  history  of  3D  printing  as  a  process  and  details  the  various  technical  developments  of  the  machinery  involved.  It  then  details a selection of 3D printing machines currently  available  and  presents  the  wide  range  of  different  processes  that  fall  under  the  umbrella  term  ‘3D  printing’. Where possible it also details some of the  visual arts practitioners that have used each of the  various processes.  Chapter  3  covers  crafts  and  how  they  interface  with  3D  printing.  This  chapter  details  some  of  the  philosophical approaches to the discipline and how  those  approaches  interface  with  methodologies  necessary to develop a practitioner approach to 3D  printing.  Three  case  studies  of  crafts  practitioners  who use 3D printing as an integral part of their work  are presented, including details of how they both deal  with the process technically and how they approach  the  process  philosophically  from  a  practitioner  perspective.  Chapter 4 describes the relationship between the  fine arts and 3D printing. It also details how artists  have worked with the technology almost since it was   first  made  commercially  available  as  a  process.  It  presents  four  case  studies  of  fine  art  practitioners  whom I feel are representative of a generation of fine  artists for whom the digital is an integral part of their  practice and not something new.  Chapter  5  explores  the  implications  of  3D  printing  for  designers  and  design  practitioners.  It  describes  the  field  and  differentiates  the  types  of  practice  between  those  designers  working  within  large companies and those who work independently.  The  chapter  presents  four  case  studies  of  skilled  designers who each have very different approaches  to 3D printing.  Chapter 6 examines the public perception of 3D  printing  through  literature  and  mainstream  press  and  how  this  in  turn  impacts  upon  the  creative  arts.  This  includes  fashion  designers  and  stop  motion animation, both of whom reach large public  audiences. This chapter also details the rise of the  Hackspace  and  Dorkbot  cultures,  then  describes  how the future might look, illustrated by examples of  current research.  Chapter 7 describes how 3D printing has entered  the mainstream with examples from both the fashion  industry  and  the  animation  industry.  Both  of  these  are beginning to use 3D printing as an everyday part  of their production.  The conclusion summarises the future potential of  3D printing for the visual arts and draws a conclusion  upon  how  artists,  designers  and  craftspeople  are  embracing the technology.  Preface  7  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   7  9 26 17   3:39 PM   Introduction  This  volume  is  of  interest  to  a  broad  range  of  academics  and  3D  print  users from across the arts, industry and science disciplines. It is aimed  at  artists,  designers  and  people  from  the  creative  industries,  but  it  will  also appeal to a more general audience of people who have an interest  in the new developments in technology. I also have to qualify what I mean  by the term ‘makers’; I am not referring to the home computer geeks but  to craftspeople. I do cover a little of the geek maker community, but this  volume is primarily about art and artists.   Between writing the first edition of this book in 2012– 13 and revising it in 2016–17, there has been a media  barrage around 3D printing. The early coverage was  mainly about the cheap do-it-yourself extruded plastic  technology  known as fused deposition modelling, or  FDM . Latterly most of the publicity has been in the  area  of  bio-medics  and  prosthetics.  The  American  technology company Gartner, which produces analysis  of the market through their Hype Curve predictions,  predicts  that  consumer  low-cost  3D  printing   FDM   is  now  in  a  five-to-ten-year  slough  of  despondency,  whereas commercial high-cost industrial 3D printing,  particularly in the area of prototyping, is heading into  the plateau of productivity.  Globally  many  universities,  research  institutions  and  industry  are  working  with  and  developing  3D  printing  as  an  additive  manufacturing  process,  and  most  believe  the  technology  is  on  the  cusp  of  the  next  big  breakthrough.  The  goal  has  been  to  move   the technology to the arena of rapid manufacture –  where it is possible to produce a fully working part.  Already  it  has  proven  possible  to  3D  print  a  fully  working  nylon  bicycle,  gold  and  silver  jewellery  and  titanium  teeth.  The  authors’  research  team   at  the  Centre for Fine Print Research  CFPR  at University of  West england, Bristol  is leading the field in printing  three-dimensional ceramics, producing cups, plates,  bowls and sculpture using the process.  In  a  broader  context  there  is  a  rapidly  growing  population of Fab Labs. As of August 2016, there are  683 Fab Labs worldwide, with 119 in the USA and 28  in the UK. Fab Labs are a community spin-off of open  access high technology workshops, originally founded  by  MIT,  based  around  3D  printing.  Another  new  phenomenon are the Tech shops, which are a more  commercial alternative to Fab Labs. Hackspaces are  physical places for the technologically aware where  people can meet to learn, socialize and collaborate   8  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   8  9 26 17   3:39 PM   on  projects.  All  of  these  are  rapidly  spreading  the  concept  of  this  new  technology  to  an  ever-growing  audience  of  users,  who  are  looking  to  situate  this  technology in their everyday lives.  In this book, I aim to demonstrate that 3D printing  is  now  becoming  an  integral  part  of  the  canon  of  arts  practice.  I  have  two  clear  aims.  The  first  is  to  introduce to an arts-based audience the potential of  the process now commonly known as 3D printing. The  second is to place the sequence of processes that  make  up  the  discipline  into  some  sort  of  historical  perspective and timeline in relation to the visual arts. I intend to demonstrate objectively how these new  processes have been accepted by using a number of  case studies of current practitioners and explaining  how their diverse practices are creating new methods  of working for others to follow.  one  could  argue  that  any  new  process  is  beginning to gain capital and acknowledged credibility  in  the  world  when  it  starts  to  accumulate  a  variety  of  names.  3D  printing  is  currently  in  this  phase.  Alternative  names  include:  free-form  fabrication,  rapid manufacture, additive layer manufacture  ALM ,  selective  laser  sintering   SLS ,  stereo-lithography   STL ,  rapid  prototyping   RP   and  fused  deposition  modelling  FDM .  often  a  change  in  the  cultural  acceptance  of  a  new process can be traced to a single event, which  in itself may not have been significant at the time,  but in retrospect serves as an indicator of changing  perceptions. An issue of Wired magazine in 2010 with  a feature article by editor Chris Anderson1 entitled ‘In  the  Next  Industrial  Revolution,  Atoms  Are  the  New  Bits’ highlights this changing perception. When this   Keith Brown, ‘Crest’, 2009.  Introduction  9  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   9  9 26 17   3:39 PM   article  was  published  I  began  to  understand  that  a  fundamentally  different  approach  to  manufacturing  was beginning to take place.  Perhaps  the  most  perceptive  comment  within  the  article  is  the  following:  ‘Here’s  the  history  of  two decades in one sentence. If the past ten years  have  been  about  discovering  post-institutional  models on the web, then the next ten years will be  about  applying  them  to  the  real  world.’  Anderson  was  probably  talking  more  about  the  influence  of  social  media,  how  society  approached  problems  collectively,  and  how  this  collaborative  approach  would operate beyond the web. However, the article  went on to highlight a number of new ways of working  inspired by 3D printing, such as a crowd-sourced car  and  the  phenomena  of  Fab  Labs  and  Tech  Shops.  It is that real-world application of digital technology  that has evolved from that past excitement over 3D  printing. The prospect of designing a virtual object on   your  Mac  or  PC  and  then  just  pressing  a  button  to  print it out in real materials was very appealing and  futuristic. The reality has been, in fact, very far from  this – at least in the years 2010 through 2016. even  now, at the time of writing, the only processes within  the  field  of  additive  layer  manufacture  that  even  approach  the  reality quality  of  a  finished  article  in  real materials are laser-sintered titanium, steel and  nylon.  In  the  field  of  the  visual  arts,  two  research  projects define new directions in real materials: The  collaboration  between  Cookson’s  and  Birmingham  UCe  Jewellery  Innovation  Centre  to  print  gold  and  precious  metals  and  the  work  of  my  own  research  team at the University of the West of england, Bristol,  in  3D-printed  ceramics.  All  of  these  processes  still  require  a  great  deal  of  cleaning  and  finishing  after  printing; you cannot just take them as finished items  straight from the printer. I can quite safely say at this  point that currently no process offers what the user  requires, and I say that as a fan and advocate of 3D  printing!  There  is  no  doubt  that  these  processes,  in  the  long term, do have the ability to create a disruptive  technology,  as  articulated  by  Chris  Anderson.  3D  printing’s disruptive path may well happen in a similar  way to the introduction of web-based communication,  which superseded the traditional newspaper printing  industry.  This  takes  time;  the  revolution  in  printing  and  communication  took  nearly  30  years  from  the  initial  introduction  of  computer  typesetting.  This  is  exemplified  by  the  Wapping  dispute  with  the  Murdoch press in the early 1980s. Here the catalyst  for  change  was  the  advent  of  desktop  publishing  software,  such  as  Aldus  PageMaker  for  the  Apple  Macintosh,  developed  in  the  late  1980s.  The  print  unions  struggled  with  management  over  job  cuts  because  the  journalists  could  now  type  their  copy  directly into a computer and the printed page could  be made up on screen, without the need for trained  typesetters.  There  was  no  longer  a  requirement  for  the  legions  of  typesetters,  platemakers  and  reprographics departments.  Sophie Kahn, Head of a Young Woman.  10  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   10  9 26 17   3:39 PM   A  more  recent  catalyst  was  the  spread  of  the  home PC and the widespread adoption of the Internet  in  the  1990s.  This  has  led  us  to  the  smartphone  and apps in the last few years, which have enabled  consumers to not only read a newspaper and but also  get the news in different forms on their smartphones  and  tablets  instantly,  without  any  physical  object  ever  having  existed  and  with  no  waste  product  to  throw  away  after  reading.  Collectively,  all  of  these  developments, which grew from the development of  one  digital  technology,  have  resulted  in  the  steady  decline of the traditional newspaper industry.  If  we  assume  that  3D  printing,  as  a  disruptive  technology,  is  following  the  same  path,  then  I  believe we are not even yet in the ‘Wapping’ phase.  I  came  to  3D  printing  relatively  late,  around  2005,  when  commercial  machines  had  been  on  the  market  for  almost  two  decades.  At  that  time  no  major  industry  had  yet  adopted  3D  printing  as  a  primary  manufacturing  technology.  However,  there  were examples where the technology was gradually  beginning to be used. Today in aerospace 3D printing  technology  is  used  to  produce  titanium  parts  that  have  convoluted  gas  flow  paths  through  the  part,  with no casting or joining seams. 3D printing these  parts has the further benefit of increasing space and  cooling  capacity.  In  Formula  1,  3D  printing  is  used  for parts tailored specifically to the individual car and  driver, as most of these parts are one off or, at most,  manufactured in double figures. The dental industry  also  increasingly  employs  3D  printing  technology  for the manufacture of replacement teeth, because  these are individually tailored but printed en masse  in one build of the 3D print machine.  Finally  3D  printing  is  beginning  to  be  used  in  planning  medical  surgery,  such  as  orthopaedic  surgery. For example, CAT scans can be turned into  3D-printed  replicas  of  fractures  enabling  surgeons  to work out how an operation might be undertaken  –  and  particularly  in  veterinary  surgery,  where  the  medical  governance  restrictions  are  less  stringent.  None of these applications are geared up for large- scale  manufacture,  but  this  may  come  in  the  next  few years.  The rise of the cheap home printer, such as the  RepRap,  MakerBot,  Cubify  or  Lulzbot  machines,  was fascinating in its influence on the future of 3D   printing and its general acceptance as a technology.  This  phenomena  certainly  did  much  to  promote  the  cause  of  3D  printing,  but  it  also  added  to  the  unrealistic  hype,  perhaps  exemplified  by  the  fuss  about the ‘3D-printed gun’2 and popular books such  as  the  novel  Makers  by  Cory  Doctrow   see  Chapter  6 , where the chief characters print everything from  fairground rides to electronic parts using a 3D printer  and  ‘goop’   theoretically  an  epoxy-based  material!   All of this publicity was not a bad thing – any publicity  is good publicity.  The rise of the affordable 3D printer has had both  positive  and  negative  effects  on  the  marketplace.  The two largest companies in the field, 3D Systems  and  Stratasys,  both  bought  up  low-cost  FDM  manufacturers and, along with 57 other companies,  produced a flood of low cost machines, ranging from  US$500 to US$2,500. Both the major players have  now  ceased  production  of  their  low-cost  printers,  as  the  market  collapsed  because  the  average  purchaser  lacked  sufficient  knowledge  to  run  the  machine  consistently.  Those  machines  that  survive  in this area are now very reliable  see Chapter 2 . The  positive side was all of the publicity surrounding 3D  printing and the fact that the proliferation of cheap  printers has created a high quality low-end market,  partially fuelled by the end of the protection of many  original patents  see Chapter 2 .  It is always difficult to predict the future, but in my  mind 3D printing is and will develop in a number of  different ways. The ‘high end’ of the 3D print industry  that primarily involves the metal fabrication of parts  will remain high end and will be used mainly by the big  industrial manufacturers to make specialist parts on  high-tech machinery that will continue to cost many  hundreds of thousands of pounds. These machines  will become more and more specialised and will only  be capable of manufacturing very high quality parts  within a very narrow spectrum. The same will apply  for machines that will be geared to bio-medics.  I  think  that  the  middle  ground  will  be  occupied  by  bureau  services  such  as  Shapeways™  and  iMaterialise™   see  Chapter  2 .  You  can  use  these  services to order a part you need online, in the same  way  that  you  might  order  something  from  Amazon,  and it will be printed, finished and then dispatched  to  you.  Bureau  services  marry  the  ability  to  mass   9781474248679_txt_app.indb   11  11  9 26 17   3:39 PM   customise a bespoke printed object with economies  of  scale,  thus  reducing  the  need  for  warehousing,  transport  and  stocking  –  truly  creating  just-in- time  solutions.  I  see  this  as  the  largest  potential  growth  area;  many  products  in  this  sector  will  be  manufactured and dispatched without the customer  even knowing they are 3D printed. To return to our 2D  digital printing analogy, this method of manufacture  will be ‘print on demand’ much the same as current  online  book  production  websites,  such  as  Lulu  or  Blurb, or Amazon’s out of print books service, where  the copy is printed and bound only when the order is  received and then dispatched direct to the customer.  So  even  though  the  book  is  produced  on  a  high- volume large-scale machine, it is a tiny segment of a  continuous printing process.  The  ‘low  cost  end’  of  the  3D  printing  market  has  changed  so  rapidly  that  it  is  hard  to  make  any  predictions.  In  the  first  edition  of  this  book,  I  stated that I thought there would be a 3D print toy  market,  and  yet  a  year  ago  I  would  have  said  that  the potential toy market was too complicated. In the  last few months, however, Mattel has just launched  its Thingmaker, and I can find seven other printers  that are aimed at children. Across the wider cheap  spectrum, many patents ceased to be enforceable in  2013 and 2014, so there have been a number of new  digital  light  projection   DLP   and  stereo  lithography  machines that have made big changes to the market   see Chapter 2 .  I  have  reservations  that  these  machines  will  fulfil  a  long-term  manufacturing  role  apart  from  niche areas such as printable foodstuffs, or low-end  prototyping  and  model  making.  In  fact  it  is  already  possible  to  print  using  chocolate  and  icing  sugar  from a pressure-fed head on cheap Fused Deposition  Modelling  FDM  machines.  But where then does this technology fit within a  creative arts context? Its influence is slowly gaining  ground. early adopters such as Assa Ashuach in the  design  field  or  Keith  Brown  within  the  visual  arts  field  are  slowly  being  joined  by  many  more  visual  arts practitioners as the learning curve for entry gets  easier and more affordable. 3D printing will become  more  mainstream  as  artists  and  creatives  adopt  these  processes.  At  this  point  in  time  the  majority   of users are primarily concerned with the technology  rather than the specific objects that 3D printing tools  can create. While artists are seldom the leaders in a  new technology, established artists tend to push the  boundaries  of  new  technology  into  new  interesting  areas. It is at this stage that the technology becomes  more mainstream and functional, rather than simply  creating artefacts that are primarily products of the  technology.  I  firmly  believe  that  this  technology  has  the  potential to be a catalyst for breaking the arts and  science divide, as first articulated by C. P. Snow in  the 1950s.3 Snow explained that historically the two  disciplines were not separated but by the 1950s the  arts and science had become two completely different  philosophical  approaches.  Most  of  the  recent  interventions  of  the  arts  with  industry  have  been  attempts to create an artificial marriage between the  two.  Conversely,  the  underlying  philosophy  of  this  book is to directly link arts and industry, an approach  employed by the author at the CFPR that has caught  the  attention  of  government  and  national  research  councils.4  This  research  provides  a  case  study  of  how this new technology will influence industry in the  future, create wealth and capital for the UK economy,  and  is  also  an  exemplar  of  the  possible  interface  between the arts and industry.  Finally,  to  return  to  the  visual  arts,  the  potential  of  3D  printing  is  its  function  as  a  new  tool.  The  technology in itself will not make art; it is inanimate and  subservient to the user, although this subservience is  not always obvious in the objects that one makes with  the process. However, I am sure there will be a new  breed of artists who will run with the technology in ways  that are different to anything of which I can conceive.  In  writing  this  book  I  have  encountered  work  that  has  surprised  and  delighted  me  for  its  combination  of  innovation  and  elegance,  using  the  technology  in  ways that transcend the actual process. In particular,  for me, Karin Sanders, Stephanie Lempert, Marianne  Forrest,  Neri  oxman,  Jack  Row,  Michael  eden,  Jonathan Monaghan, Lionel Dean, Sophie Kahn, Laura  Alvarado and Vivian Meller have all created works that  I would want to own and live with – and not because  they are 3D printed but because they in themselves  are inherently beautiful works of art.  12  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   12  9 26 17   3:39 PM   I also believe that there is a surprising democracy  to  3D  printing.  Traditionally  most  observers  of  technology  would  assume  that  a  digital  interface  activity  requiring  knowledge  of  both  software  and  engineering  could  only  be  the  domain  of  the  young  male.  However,  the  fact  that  seven  of  the  eleven  practitioners  of  3D  printing  I  have  cited  above  are  female  illustrates  that,  in  the  creative  sphere  at  least,  the  users  interfacing  with  the  technology  are  not  necessarily  following  the  expected  norms  associated with digital technologies. The case studies For  this  book  I  interviewed  seven  new  leading  practitioners  in  their  respective  disciplines.  I  have  divided these into four primary categories: designers,  fine  artists,  craftspeople  and  ‘other  disciplines’.  As a practitioner I firmly believe in interdisciplinary  work and do not like the traditional artistic labels;  however,  it  would  have  been  difficult  to  divide  the  chapters  in  any  other  way.  I  deliberately  chose   practitioners with an established history of practice  in 3D printing. In this edition two things have become  clear. First, practitioners have become much more  difficult  to  pigeonhole;  for  example,  I  spent  much  time  agonising  where  to  put  the  goldsmith  Jack  Row and the designer craftspeople jewellers Vivian  Meller  and  Laura  Alvarado.  Second,  nearly  all  of  the new case studies are far more acquainted with  the  technology  and  what  they  expect  to  get  from  it.  I  tried  to  ask  all  practitioners  the  same  set  of  questions,  starting  with  how  they  would  describe  themselves and their personal practice. Whilst the  intention was to draw consistent information, each  individual’s  priorities  were  different.  Therefore,  I  have  transcribed  the  interviews  in  an  informal  manner  in  order  to  show  how  each  individual  has  a  personal  approach  to  3D  printing.  This  also  demonstrates  how  the  creative  practitioners  tailor  the process of 3D printing to their own requirements  and how they use the technology in a manner that  is not necessarily prescribed by the manufacturer.  1  Anderson, C.  2010 , ‘The Next  Industrial Revolution, Atoms are the New  Bits’, Wired, 18  2 : 58.  2  Greenberg, A.  2013, May 5 ,   ‘Meet The “Liberator”: Test-Firing   the World’s First Fully 3D-Printed   Gun’, Forbes.

I  have  focused  on  the  physical  outputs  of  the  technology  mainly  because  there  are  many  other  excellent  texts  that  deal  very  particularly  with  the  rise  of  screen-based  digital  technology  and  its  relationship with the visual arts.  A Computer in the  Art Room1 is one of the best examples. I propose to  take that set of virtual technological developments as  read, including most of the software developments,  and  concentrate  on  the  three-dimensional  physical  output  generated  by  3D  printing  hardware.  It  is  specifically  those  developments  in  physical  output  that  can  be  generated  from  a  digital  file  that  will  be  covered  here.  Therefore,  by  necessity,  I  will  try  to  give  a  comprehensive  view  of  the  history  of  the  technological  hardware  developments  and  their  contribution to the development of 3D printing. I will  then  illustrate  that  history  with  examples  of  arts- based practice in order to create a timeline to show  how artists have interfaced with the technology and  how this runs in parallel to the industry.  In  common  with  many  commercial  processes  adopted  by  artists  and  subsumed  into  the  canon  of  artistic  practice,  the  origins  of  3D  printing  can  be   ascribed to many historic contexts and starting points.  3D printing in particular is a young enough technology  to  have  several  traceable  development  patterns.  However, it does not yet have a clearly defined history  beyond that of a straightforward engineering technical  development  much  like  that  of  a  mobile  phone.  The  recent  history  of  3D  printing,  quite  rightly  in  my  view,  begins  post-1976,  but  relevant  developments  in  technologies  were  actually  made  from  the  1850s  onwards.2  It  is  those  earlier  technologies  that  I  will  speculate upon here before documenting 3D printing’s  history as it relates to the visual arts.  An  historical  perspective  of  the  visual  arts’  interaction  with  3D  printing  is  needed  because  the  vast  majority  of  the  3D  printing  industry  is  only  just  becoming  aware  that  there  could  be  an  arts  perspective  to  the  technology.  This  is  entirely  separate  to  the  fact  that  artists  themselves  are  very  keen  to  adopt  the  technology.  Clearly,  as  we  document each process, we have no proof that each  subsequent  invention  was  directly  informed  by  the  previous  work.  However,  once  a  process  is  in  the  public  domain,  then  developments  occur  both  from   14  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   14  9 26 17   3:39 PM   1  2  1  Unfold Labs, ‘Stratigraphic  Porcelain’, 2011.

In order to create a visual history, to  delve into 3D printing’s earliest origins, we can liken  its earliest history to the development of the coil pot  in Neolithic culture. The coil pot, unlike almost any  other making or craft process, is a directly additive  process. In plain terms, one builds the pot by adding  clay one coil at a time until one has built a complete  object.  This  hand-built  process  has  direct  parallels  to the fused deposition modelling  FDM  method of  building a 3D object with a coil of heated plastic wire  and can be said to be in complete harmony with the  process of extruding clay to build a 3D-printed pot.  The  clay  extrusion  process  was  first  developed  as  a  3D  process  by  Unfold  Labs  in  Belgium3  and  additionally  taken  up  by  Jonathan  Keep4  and  also  Peter  Walters  et  al.5  The  heated  FDM  head  and  plastic  are  replaced  with  a  syringe  filled  with  clay  or  slip.  Since  writing  this  in  2013,  the  variety  of  materials that can be extruded by the FDM process  has  expanded  exponentially.  Now  it  is  possible  to  extrude materials as diverse as soft plastics, wood,  recycled milk bottles and an infinite variety of clays. Until  the  advent  of  3D  printing,  most  three- processes  were  dimensional  manufacturing  subtractive  –  in  other  words,  based  on  carving  or  machining the object from a larger block of material.   9781474248679_txt_app.indb   15  15  9 26 17   3:40 PM   Whilst I am aware this is a fairly subjective statement   as  casting  processes  are  additive ,  invariably,  in  order  to  create  a  mould  or  make  a  die,  a  positive  pattern  or electrode used in spark erosion  has first  to be created, usually by subtractive means. In the  case of spark erosion, where the metal is eroded by  an electric current, creating a spark to eat away the  material,  a  positive  block  first  has  to  be  milled  in  graphite  or  copper  in  order  to  create  an  electrode.  This  to  engineering  practice;  therefore, in artistic terms, it may be easier to talk  about  the  traditional  fine  art  processes  of  carving  and  modelling.  Carving  is  the  subtractive  process,  such  as  in  carving  a  block  of  wood  or  marble,  and  modelling  is  the  additive  process,  such  as  in  modelling a head from clay for bronze casting, where  one slowly adds clay to model the form.  relates  directly   In 2001 Joseph Beaman, from the University of  Texas  in  Austin,6  traced  the  dual  chronology  of  3D  printing technology from the mid-nineteenth century  up  to  the  1970s  via  two  approaches:  topographic  and  photosculpture.  He  defined  these  processes   as:  Topography  plots  a  surface  in  a  linear  manner  and then reproduces that surface from a linear form.  Photosculpture uses the camera and lens to capture  a  surface,  and  then  analogue  photomechanical  processes  are  used  to  reproduce  it.  Beaman  uses  this technological divergence to define the growth of  3D printing through two primary approaches. The first  approach is the powder deposition and layered-object  manufacture methods of 3D printing, such as the Z  Corp  process   now  called  3D  Systems ,  which  are  akin to the topographic approach. The photosculpture  approach  addresses  all  of  the  methods  that  use  a  photopolymeric liquid hardened by light, such as the  objet 3D Printing method.  Beaman’s  photosculpture  track  begins  in  1863  with  the  Willème  photosculpture  patent,  and  his  topography track begins in 1890 with a patent from  Blanther,  who,  in  Beaman’s  words,  ‘suggested  a  layered method for making a mould for topographic  relief  maps.  The  method  consisted  of  impressing  topographical  contour  lines  onto  a  series  of  wax  plates and cutting these wax plates on the lines.’  3  American, ‘Ulysses S. Grant’, c. 1870.

Science &  Society Picture Library, Science  Museum Group enterprises Ltd.  4  Whilst I agree with the rationale for these tracks,  there is much overlap between the two. I would start  the  topographic  track  much  earlier,  at  the  turn  of  the nineteenth century, beginning with the sculpture  copying  machines  of  the  inventor  of  the  steam  engine, James Watt, who from his retirement in 1800  to his death in 1819 developed a series of machines  for copying sculpture, which he never patented.  The  extant  machine  can  still  be  seen  in  his  workshop, which is preserved in the Science Museum  in  London.7  In  my  opinion,  these  machines  are  definitely the forerunner of the topographic machine  described by Beaman. The sculpture copying machine  was  improved  upon  by  Benjamin  Cheverton,8  who  in  1884  patented  a  sculpture  copying  machine  for  reducing  sculpture,  much  like  a  three-dimensional  pantagraph. A copy of Cheverton’s machine may also  be seen at the Science Museum.  Cheverton’s  machine  was  fitted  with  a  rotating  cutting bit, which was used to carve reduced versions  of  well-known  sculptures.  Cheverton  demonstrated  his reducing machine at the great exhibition in 1851,  winning a gold medal for his copy of ‘Theseus’ from the  elgin Marble collection in the British Museum. Many  copies of Cheverton’s sculptures still exist today and  a large collection of over 200 busts can be viewed at   5  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   17  17  9 26 17   3:40 PM   6  7  6  Benjamin Cheverton’s copy of ‘Theseus’ from the elgin Marble  collection at the British Museum, 1851. Parian sculptured bust of  Benjamin Cheverton. In the early nineteenth century, the middle classes  liked to display busts of famous figures in literature and music as well as  copies of famous antique sculptures. A new material, Parian ware, was  introduced in the 1840s by the firm of Copeland and Garrett and closely  followed by Minton. This unglazed, fine-grained porcelain had a slight  sheen and soon replaced plaster of Paris. James Watt  1736–1819  had   developed a machine to produce scaled-down copies of original works.  Cheverton perfected the machine for commercial use in 1836.

Concurrent with Cheverton  was the French engineer and designer Achille Collas,9  who also produced a method of reproducing sculpture  using  a  pantagraph.  I  would  argue  that  these  machines were the forerunners of today’s computer  numeric control  CNC  milling machines, which in turn  were the forerunners of 3D printing.  The  other  track,  as  postulated  by  Beaman,  relates  directly  to  photography  and  its  descendent,  photosculpture. This in some ways makes it easier to  draw a parallel in artistic terms, as it is possible to trace  developments  of  3D  sculptural  creation  in  relation  to photography back to the early nineteenth century.  Walters  and  Thirkell10  argue  that  the  origins  of  3D  printing are based within photographic scanning and  recreation  processes,  such  as  the  aforementioned  process of photosculpture, developed in France in the  1860s by François Willème11 and the ‘Photographic  Process for the Reproduction of Plastic objects’, for   which  Carlo  Baese  filed  a  United  States  patent  in  1904.12  Willème situated his subjects in the centre of a  circular  room  and  photographed  them  using  twenty- four  cameras  placed  around  the  circumference  of  the room. From these photographs silhouettes were  created and then the outline of each photograph was  projected onto a screen. The outlines of the projections  were then used by an artisan who, with the aid of a  pantagraph that had a knife or carving tool attached,  carved the bust from a cylindrical block of plaster, or  clay, thus using each of the 24 photographs to create  the form. The resulting sculpture was then smoothed  out  by  eye,  before  casting  in  plaster  to  make  a  mould.  Willème’s  process  had  a  well  documented  commercial  life  and  his  large  Paris  studio  was  in  operation from 1863 to 1868.13  Willème  in  fact  had  two  types  of  approach  to  his  process,  documented  in  Sobieszek’s  article   18  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   18  9 26 17   3:40 PM   about  photosculpture  in  France.14  There  was  an  earlier  process,  which  Sobieszek  calls  ‘mechanical  sculpture’.  Fifty  photographs  were  taken  in  a  circumference at points equidistant from the sitter.  The  photos  were  then  developed  and  individually  outlined  on  wood  and  cut  in  half.  each  wooden  profile half section was cut to an individual wedge.  Finally, all 100 wedges were assembled as a circular  bust.  This  is  one  of  the  earliest  demonstrations  of  slicing  an  object  in  exactly  the  same  way  as  most  current 3D printing processes. An extant example of  this  process  may  be  found  in  the  eastman  Kodak  Museum in Rochester, New York State.  In  the  United  Sates,  Carlo  Baese  proposed  to  alleviate some of the carving undertaken in the Willème  process  by  using  the  properties  of  Bichromated  Gelatine in his development, which were well known  from  the  work  of  Fox  Talbot  and  Walter  Woodbury.  He  proposed  to  use  layers  of  swelled  gelatine,  laid  one  on  top  of  the  other,  to  create  the  relief  as  he  photographed  around  the  head.  It  is  not  clear  if  Baese  actually  managed  to  use  or  commercialise   his  process.  However,  from  a  twenty-first  century  perspective, as well as my own experience of working  with  bichromated  gelatine  processes,  it  does  not  seem  likely  this  was  a  workable  process   beyond  the theoretical . The technical challenges of handling  many  layers  of  gelatine  –  and  the  added  difficulty  of  previous  layers  shrinking  and  hardening  as  you  apply  new  layers  –  seem  too  problematic  and  time  consuming.  It  is,  however,  a  very  forward-looking  concept, and as Baese patented the process he must  have achieved some level of practical success, thus  securing its place as a forerunner to a new technology. My view is that the Willème method relates more to  a topographic approach, whereas the Baese method  uses  a  light-sensitive  gelatine  and  can  therefore  be  defined  as  a  photographic  approach.  Gelatine  is  in  itself a bio-polymer, a precursor to the polymers now  used in 3D printing. If we look back to the early Victorian  history of photography, we can see the development  of a light-sensitive material from Mungo Ponton, who  discovered  the  properties  of  using  a  chrome-based  hardener material in 1839. ‘Ponton found that paper   8  Carlo  Baese’s patent  diagram for the  ‘Photographic  Process for the  Reproduction of  Plastic objects’.

There is little doubt that these processes are the birth  of the photopolymeric relief processes, which are an  integral part of contemporary 3D printing.  Ponton had discovered the light-sensitive properties  of chrome salts, and this discovery was built upon by  William Henry Fox Talbot. In 1847, Talbot filed a patent  for combining gelatine with potassium bichromate.16  These  two  factors  were  to  form  the  basis  for  all  photomechanical  printing  processes  for  the  next  century and would consequently lead to the birth of  modern photopolymeric 3D printing.  These developments become even more relevant  to  the  future  of  3D  printing  when,  in  1865,  Walter  Woodbury17 created a continuous tone photographic  relief  process  that  transcribed  a  black  and  white  photograph  into  a  tonal  relief  surface.  Woodbury  created a slab of gelatine approximately one inch thick   25mm  to which was added a 3.5 per cent solution  of potassium bichromate, making the gelatine light- sensitive. When exposed to a photographic negative,  the gelatine hardens in direct proportion to the light  it has received. once washed with water, the gelatine  forms a tonal relief ‘bump map topography’ in three  dimensions,  with  the  white  areas  standing  proud  and  the  dark  areas  forming  the  valleys.  Woodbury  then made a lead matrix from the gelatine and could  create continuous tone prints in hot liquid translucent  gelatine  ink  from  the  matrix.  When  cool,  the  tonal  range  of  the  prints  was  entirely  dependent  on  the   10  Woodbury image from ‘Men  of Mark’ 1877.

The  results  were  spectacular  and  are  perhaps  best  represented  in  John  Thompson’s  Street  Life  of  London   1877 18,  which  are  also  some  of  the  earliest examples of social documentary photography.  However,  the  process  was  problematic.  It  not  only  required a highly skilled workforce to make the matrices  and print the images, but also because the hot liquid  gelatine  squirted  out  from  the  sides  of  the  matrix  as  the  pressure  increased  during  printing,  the  prints  had  to  be  cut  down  and  pasted  into  the  published  books by hand. This effectively killed the process for  commercially  viable  mass  production  despite  its  obvious high quality results.  Now let’s leap forward sixty years to the 1930s  and the industrial ceramicist Walter Ford of the Ford  Ceramic Arts Company in ohio. Ford successfully built   upon Woodbury’s gelatine process to create low relief  ceramic  moulds.  Instead  of  creating  a  lead  matrix,  he used the light-sensitive gelatine slab to create a  plaster mould. From this mould he cast ceramic relief  tiles that, once ‘biscuit’ fired and had a translucent  glaze applied, created the photographic tonal relief.  Where the glaze pooled it became thicker in the low  areas  and  created  the  dark  tones.  The  high  areas,  then, had a very thin glaze, and the combination of  the two produced photographic highlights. Ford was  granted  a  patent  for  the  process  in  1936.19  Ford  had  created  a  physical  relief  photographic  image  in  a  permanent  material  that  did  not  require  the  intervention of a craftsman to realise the image.20  This  process  was  a  direct  descendent  of  the  photoceramic relief tiles created by George Cartlidge  between the 1880s and the late 1910s. The tonal  range was again dictated by the height of the relief;  the white areas were high and the black areas were  low.  once  translucent  glaze  was  applied,  the  tiles  exhibited a photographic quality, with rich black and  a  subtle  tonal  range  through  to  white,  dictated  by   9781474248679_txt_app.indb   21  21  9 26 17   3:41 PM   14  15  the relief height of the tile. Created primarily for the  company Sherwin and Cotton, it is generally believed  that these tiles were photographic precursors of the  Ford Tiles.21 From my own discussions with Cartlidge’s  nephew and research I undertook between 2003 and  2006,  I  believe  the  tiles  were  actually  sculpted  in  wax  from  photographic  negatives,  in  the  same  way  the  photolithophanes  were  created  in  Limoges  in  France during the same period.22  The reason I discuss Ford before Cartlidge is that  Ford is the direct descendent of Woodbury – in terms  of  photomechanical  process.  Although  the  Cartlidge  tiles  have  all  of  the  attributes  and  appearance  of  a  true  photomechanical  process,  they  were  in  fact  completely autographic. There is no doubt that these  tiles  were  the  primary  influence  for  Ford  and  his  subsequent photoceramic work. The development of  these  processes  laid  the  groundwork  for  a  directly  transcribable  photographic  process  that  can  be  realized into a three-dimensional photorealistic object. To return to the topographic track, in the 1950s  the  London-based  sculptor  George  Macdonald  Reid   developed  an  extension  of  the  Willème  technique  by  using  army  surplus  map-making  machinery  to  produce  a  series  of  portrait  busts.  The  process  used  a  combination  of  work  by  hand,  photography  and an adapted lathe. In particular, Reid’s technique  mapped a surface contour, in much the same way as  Willème, to produce the 3D model.  To capture the data, the subject was placed on  a revolving chair and up to 300 profile photographs  were  taken.  These  were  then  transcribed  to  an  outline profile, which was then milled into a plaster  block. The full process can be viewed in two Pathè  News films, one from 1957 entitled Robot Sculpture,  which features the creation of a portrait head of the  Danish  actress  Lillemore  Knudsen,23  and  another  entitled Instant Sculpture  1963 , which features the  racing  driver  Graham  Hill.24  Macdonald  Reid  made  many  adaptations  to  the  process  in  the  six  years  between the recording of the two films.  In 1956 otto Munz filed a patent that predates  most 3D printing technologies by thirty years,25 but  Beaman argues this patent clearly represents the link   22  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   22  9 26 17   3:41 PM   between photography and the current technologies.  In  his  patent,  Munz  postulates  an  idea  he  calls  ‘Photo-glyph recording’ in which:  A  layer  of  a  photo-emulsion  of  the  silver  halide  type  in a transparent medium suspension, of exposing said  layer at a predetermined focus with said radiation, of  developing and fixing said photo-emulsion, of covering  the  said  fixed  layer  of  photo-emulsion  with  another  layer  of  unexposed  photo-emulsion  and  of  bringing   said  unexposed  layer  of  said  photo-emulsion  into  said  predetermined  focus  with  said  radiation  and  of  repeating  said  cycle,  the  number  of  repetitions  being  controlled by the third magnitude recorded.  In simple terms, Munz proposed to create a 3D  object by exposing layer upon layer of photographic  emulsion,  which  is  hardened  by  light  one  layer  at  a  time!  Thus  he  spanned  the  divide  between  processes  such  as  Woodburytype  and  Baese  and   14  George Cartlidge, ‘Sophia’, 1904. The  image of a New Zealand Maori woman on a  photoceramic tile.

It is in the 1960s that photopolymer emulsions  began to be used extensively in the printing industry  –  in  particular,  for  the  flexographic  process.26  originally  known  as  ‘aniline  printing’,  the  process  was  renamed  ‘flexography’  in  1952.  It  is  now  one  of  the  most  commonly  used  printing  processes.  Print that is on packaging is printed by flexography,  covering everything from your milk bottle and cereal  packet  to  the  box  your  fridge  arrives  in.  These  are  direct  descendents  of  the  light-sensitive  gelatine  processes such as Woodburytype and photogravure.  These emulsions now come in many forms but can  create a multitude of printing plates, which can vary  in size, from a plate an inch thick to a thin coated  roller.  Depending  upon  their  composition,  they  can  be hardened to produce printing plates from very soft  to extremely rigid. It is this photo-polymeric emulsion  chemistry that has formed much of the basis of the  3D printing industry, where photo-polymeric plastics  can  now  be  hardened  by  light  to  create  physical  objects.  However,  the  development  and  history  of  any  process  or  set  of  processes  is  never  linear.  It  is  therefore perfectly valid to trace a number of other  histories  or  timelines  that  relate  to  the  processes  of  3D  printing.  Most  developments  occur  both  in  isolation and in tandem with peer developments in the  field. For example, the developments in photopolymer  light-sensitive  emulsions  and  photography  are  both  relevant to the field of 3D printing, but we also need  to  consider  other  developments  in  engineering,  specifically  CNC  milling  and  CAD   Computer  Aided  Design  technologies.  If  one  follows  the  documented  development  of  the  3D  printing  process  from  an  engineering  standpoint, 3D printing is also a direct descendent  of  CNC  milling.  The  process  involves  transcribing  numeric  data  into  a  file  that  will  then  subtractively  cut away a solid block to create an object. CNC was  first  developed  during  the  1940s,  and  the  numeric  control  part   which  came  first   is  attributed  to  an  American  engineering  machinist  and  salesman  John T. Parsons. The process continued to develop  throughout the 1950s and 1960s.27 With the price of  computers and CNC machinery dropping rapidly in the  1970s, CNC soon became the bedrock of industrial   19  24  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   24  9 26 17   3:41 PM   19  Richard Hamilton,  ‘Depth of Cut’, from the  series of work ‘Five Tyres  Remoulded’.

CAD  was  a  natural  progression because, as in many other arenas where  computer design tools were introduced, it allowed a  separation between the draughtsman or designer and  the machine. The ubiquity in industry of three-, four-  and  five-axis  milling  machinery  is  hard  to  describe  to a non-specialist. Perhaps the best entry point is  knowing that when you buy almost any part or piece  of machinery – whether metal or plastic – if it has not  itself been milled by a CNC machine then the tool or  mould  that  made  that  part  or  piece  will  have  been  milled by a CNC machine.  Milling  is  a  subtractive  process.  In  essence,  it  is  the  process  of  drilling  out  an  object  from  a  solid block of material. Historically, this would have  involved  using  a  lathe  to  which  a  block  of  wood  or  metal is clamped in a horizontal ‘chuck’. The block  is then spun and a chisel or cutting tool is applied to  the spinning block to cut away parts of the block. A  simple example of a product that results from milling  is  the  traditional  round  chair  leg,  which  is  created  from a rectangular block of wood.  The  next  technological  development  in  milling  was the milling machine, where the block is mounted  in a chuck that is horizontal or vertical. Crucially, in  this milling machine it is the tool and not the block   that spins – in this case, a drill or router is used as  the spinning tool to cut away parts of the block.  The  key  development  in  milling  technology  was  the  ability  to  move  the  drill  or  router  forwards  and  backwards  horizontally  as  well  as  vertically.  With  the  advent  of  the  personal  computer  in  the  early  1970s,  the  cutting  paths  of  the  tool  no  longer  needed  to  be  controlled  by  the  operator,  but  could  now be controlled by a computer program; hence, the  introduction of CNC.  For  many  years  artists  have  actively  used  CNC  milling  in  their  work.  Its  influence  spreads  widely  through  laser  cutting,  routing   for  this  book  I  shall  define  a  router  as  a  machine  that  mills  in  two  or  three  dimensions  with  a  very  small  Z-axis   and,  of  course, 3D printing.  With  the  introduction  of  CAD  packages  in  the  1980s,  it  became  difficult  to  separate  arts  practitioners that used CNC as part of their artistic  production  methods  from  those  arts  practitioners  that  used  the  early  forms  of  3D  printing.  As  both  processes can often share the same digital file, the  two processes overlap and artists tended to use both  in the early days of 3D printing. Many still do.  In  my  opinion  one  of  the  first  extant  examples  of  a  physical  digitally  printed  artwork  of  any  note   9781474248679_txt_app.indb   25  25  9 26 17   3:41 PM   occurred  in  1976,  with  Richard  Hamilton’s  piece  ‘Five  Tyres  Remoulded’.  Hamilton  had  trained  as  an  engineering  draughtsman  and  this  grounding  manifested  itself  frequently  throughout  his  art  career,  from  the  aluminium  joints  he  created  for  his stretcher frames through to ‘Five Tyres’ and his  love  of  digital  technologies.  Hamilton  was  an  early  adopter  of  Quantel  Paintbox™  and  ‘Harry’™   both  computer  generated  image  design  systems .  In  my  discussions with Hamilton between 2003 and 2010,  he explained how he had originally created ‘Five Tyres  Abandoned’ in the early 1960s as a collotype print,  but had been frustrated that the engineering drawing  was  taking  him  so  long  to  create.  He  abandoned  the project after printing the single collotype print in  1966.28 In 1976 he discovered that it was possible  to create a computer-generated CNC file to route a  brass plate, which would form a mould for a silicone  elastomer  material.  The  resulting  two-and-a-half– dimension print became part of a boxed set of seven  prints, which formed the ‘Five Tyres Remoulded’ set.  The  route  he  took  to  find  a  programmer  seems  a  little unclear, but in 2007 he stated that he had been   helped by MIT to create the CNC files. However, the  AHRC website states:29  The project had been revived when an American dealer  offered to find a US computer programmer interested in  plotting the perspective with a computer. Sherrill Martin  at Kaye Instruments organised the computer formulation  of the perspective, using a general FORTRAN™ program  called  CAPER™   Computer  aided  perspective .  The  screen prints were printed by Frank Kircherer in Stuttgart  and the collotypes by E. Schrieber next-door.  It is the creation of the 3D brass plate, and the  subsequent moulding in silicone elastomer of the tyre  print, that I argue was the first functional 3D artwork  of  note.  Hamilton  produced  an  edition  of  seventy- five  boxed  sets  of  the  seven  prints  and  a  further  individual edition of seventy-five, which just included  the silicone print. Importantly, in both editions of this  print the process was completely subservient to the  image. The computer and CNC milling route created  the result he was aiming for, one that previously he  had been unable to achieve by any other means.  21   Richard  Hamilton, ‘Treads   Area ’, from the  series of work ‘Five  Tyres Remoulded’,  1972.

Charles Csuri.  There  is  no  doubt  that  concurrent  to  this  other  artists  were  beginning  to  use  CNC  technologies  to  create artworks from digital files. The earliest among  them was Charles Csuri from the Department of Art,  ohio State University, who in 1968 created the works  ‘Ridges over Time’ and ‘Sculpture Graphic’. As an artist  he had a consistent record of early digital work exhibited  via  Siggraph,  the  special  interest  group  for  graphics  and interactive work. The Siggraph conference, which  is attended by thousands of computer professionals,   has long been the benchmark of innovation in visual  digital arts. Csuri said of Siggraph’s dedication to him:  ‘This work made use of the Bessel function to generate  the  surface.  The  computer  program  then  generated  a  punched  tape  to  represent  the  coordinate  data.  Included  were  instructions  to  a  3-axis,  continuous  path,  numerically  controlled  milling  machine   CNC .’  To  quote  further  from  Csuri:  ‘While  the  device  was  capable of making a smooth surface, I decided it was  best to leave the tools marks for the paths.'30  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   27  27  9 26 17   3:41 PM   23  Antony Gormley, ‘CoRe’. 2008.

Perhaps  one  of  the  best  recent  examples  of  art  practice  using  CNC  milling  is  Antony  Gormley’s  ‘Core’,  made  by  Metropolitan  Works,  a  fabrication  and  digital  technology  workshop  that  is  part  of  London Metropolitan University.  De  Zeen  magazine  described  the  making  of   figure is suspended from a beam adjacent to the CNC  machine used to create it, within the Centre’s imposing  machine hall. “The idea was to see if the volume of the  body could be re-described as a bubble matrix: a tight  packing of polyhedral cells that transform anatomy into  geometry,” says Gormley.  Antony  Gormley  made  use  of  digital  manufacturing  for  the  first  time  to  cut  the  master  for  his  figurative  sculpture. Previously made by hand, the process would  often take up to three weeks. Using digital technology  was  both  faster  and  resulted  in  a  more  accurate  model. His stunning iron sculpture was CNC  Computer  Numerically  Controlled   routed  from  modelling  foam,  before  being  cast  in  iron  and  finished  by  hand.  The   Whilst over the years many artists had begun to  use CNC technology for generating imagery, very little  of this actually related to 3D printing. It was not until  the advent of the first machine – the 3D Systems™  Stereolithography  SLA  1™  in  198632  –  that  artists  could  actually  turn  a  3D  file  into  a  3D  additive  printed  object.  Artists  began  to  use  the  technology  within  three  years  of  its  introduction.

However,  most  of  these  artists  were  bound  into  the  academic  research  culture  of  large  universities, where they had the resources and ability  to access the new and expensive research tools that  were being developed. This was and is still a new and  developing technology.  It  is  only  very  recently  that  well-known  artists  and  designers,  such  as  Iris  Van  Herpen33  and  Neri  oxman,34  are  beginning  to  incorporate  3D-printed  items  into  their  practice  and  to  consider  them  to  be  integral  for  material  results.  In  2012  oxman,  Director of the Mediated Matter Research Group and  Assistant  Professor  of  Media  Arts  and  Sciences  at  the MIT Media Lab, exhibited a commissioned show   at  the  Pompidou  Centre,  Paris.  ‘Imaginary  Beings:  Mythologies  of  the  Not  Yet’,  consisted  of  eighteen  new pieces that pushed the boundaries of 3D printing  technologies and required advanced R&D from objet   who  3D  printed  all  the  pieces  in  their  Connex™  material  and  sponsored  the  exhibition .  Iris  Van  Herpen, a Dutch fashion designer known for stunning  3D-printed garments, started her own label in 2007.  After studying at Artez Institute of the Arts, Arnhem,  and interning for Alexander McQueen in London and  Claudy Jongstra in Amsterdam, Van Herpen created  her second catwalk show containing garments entirely  3D printed. ‘Hybrid Holism’ was presented at the July  2012 Paris Haute Couture Week. A 3D-printed dress  was  made  in  collaboration  with  the  Architect  Julia  Koerner  for  show,  and  this  was  printed  by  the  3D   9781474248679_txt_app.indb   29  29  9 26 17   3:42 PM   print specialist bureau iMaterialise™. Since the first  edition of this book, Iris’s work has continued to lead  the field in 3D-printed fashion design alongside the  striking works fabricated by fashion designer Michael  Schmidt  see Chapter 7 .  My  view  of  any  history  of  a  process  is  that  the  initial developments posited as leading up to the first  extant  example  are  always  somewhat  speculative.  True development always begins from the first extant  example.  In  describing  the  processes  that  led  to  commercial machine development, I must sub-divide  the  first  extant  research  machine  from  the  first  extant  commercial  machine.  By  doing  this  I  mean  to show that the first research machines created by  Housholder  and  Herbert  were  capable  of  producing  a 3D print, but the process was far from repeatable,  whereas  the  first  commercial  machines  had  to  be  capable  of  producing  a  consistent  result.  Before  we can examine that extant commercial machine or  discuss how artists use the technology, we first need  to explore the history of the first research machine.  In the article ‘The Intellectual Property Implications  of  Low-Cost  3D  Printing’,  Bradshaw,  Bowyer,  and  Haufe postulate that the first patent for a 3D rapid  prototyping process was filed by Wyn Kelly Swainson  in 1977 for ‘using a laser to create covalent cross- linking at the surface of a liquid monomer where the  object being manufactured rested on a tray that was  gradually  lowered  into  the  vat  one  step  at  a  time’.  Although  this  machine  was  never  actually  made,  this patented process led to the development of the  Stereo Lithographic machine, made by 3D Systems.  The next developments  according to both Bourella35  and Beaman  include patents from Hideo Kodama of  Nagoya Municipal Research Institute in 198136 and  Herbert  from  the  3M  corporation,37  both  of  which  are  developments  of  using  a  laser  to  crosslink  a  photopolymeric solution in a bath of liquid polymer.  Another  important  research  process  in  selective  laser  sintering,  the  basis  of  both  metal  fused  and  nylon  sintering,  was  developed  and  patented  by  Dr  Carl Deckard at the University of Texas at Austin in  the mid-1980s.38 With sponsorship from DARPA and  collaborating with Joseph Beaman and Dave Bourell,  Deckard  came  up  with  the  idea  of  developing  a  manufacturing  process  where  a  powdered  material  was melted by the heat of a laser beam, one layer at   30  a time. A similar process was patented without being  commercialized by R. F. Housholder in 1979. Apart  from the patent filed by Housholder in 1981, which  is  the  first  description  of  a  laser-fused  powder  3D  printing system, and a brief description in the book  Solid Free Form Fabrication by Beaman et al., there is  little further information available on this process.39  However,  crucially  both  of  these  machines  were  actually capable of making a part, as illustrated by  Beaman in Solid Free Form Fabrication.  If  we  move  on  to  commercial  systems,  there  is  no  doubt  that  the  first  extant  commercial  Machine  SLA1  was  made  by  3D  Systems  and  patented  by  Charles Hull in 1986. This uses a laser to crosslink  a photopolymeric liquid on the surface of a bath, one  layer at a time.40  25  Charles Hull STL 3D Systems  patent for ‘Apparatus for  Production of Three-Dimensional  objects by StereoLithography’.  US Patent 4,575,330  11 March  1986 .  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   30  9 26 17   3:42 PM   26  Masaki Fujihata, ‘Forbidden Fruits’, 1990. Digital photograph of stereolithographic objects.   Masaki Fujihata.  Similar  to  the  1976  Swainson  patent,  but  using  only  one  laser,  the  process  uses  a  bath  of  photopolymeric  liquid  with  a  base  plate  that  slowly  drops  through  the  liquid  one  step  at  a  time  as  the  laser  hardens  the  object  one  layer  at  a  time  within  the  liquid.  Like  others  before  him,  such  as  Gutenberg,  Hull’s  biggest  contribution  was  to  bring  all  of  the  elements  necessary  to  make  a  process  work  together  in  one  place.  Therefore,  another  key  contribution  from  Charles  Hull  was  the  STL  file  format  –  now  the  backbone  of  file  transcription  for  3D printing. It is the combination of file transcription  and printing that make 3D printing such a disruptive  technology.  The first extant examples of an artist’s 3D prints  created in a commercial stereo lithographic machine  date from the very early 1990s. The earliest I have  found are from 1989 when Masaki Fujihata created  the work ‘Forbidden Fruits’. Fujihata41 is professor at  Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music. In  correspondence, Fujihata describes the origin of that  first 3D-printed work:  It was in the late eighties [that] I made sculpture by using  computer. I made shows in 1987, 1989. One was titled  ‘Geometric Love’ 1987. It was made with [a] Numerical  controlled  machine.  The  next  was  titled  ‘Forbidden  Fruits’ 1989 which used so-called stereo lithography.  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   31  31  9 26 17   3:42 PM   Another of the earliest 3D-printed artworks I could  find  is  from  the  American  artist  Peter  Terazakis,42  who produced ‘The Burning Man’ in 1992. In recent  correspondence, Terazakis reflected:  My  interest  in  3D  Printing  has  its  origins  in  a  fascination  with  the  atom-by-atom  movement  of  elemental  metals  in  electroplating  and  began  while  studying Michael Faraday’s experiments in grammar   school.  In  my  adult  life  I  began  to  experiment  with  electroforming.  With  the  advent  of  the  personal  computer  and  CAD  packages,  I  began  using  subtractive  machining  to  create  work.  In  1993  I  started teaching a program in what I termed ‘Digital  Sculpture’  at  New  York  City’s  School  of  Visual  Arts.  I  presented  several  talks  on  CAD   and  its  recently  arrived  hand-maiden  CAM   to  several  organizations  in NYC a few years after.  32  27  Peter Terazakis, ‘The Burning  Man’, 1992–2012.

These early pioneers in the 3D-printed visual arts  emerged  from  just  a  handful  of  artists.  A  notable  example is Dan Collins from Arizona State University.  Collins  runs  the  PRISM  Lab,  an  interdisciplinary  3D  modelling  and  rapid  prototyping  facility.  In  1994  he  created a 3D-printed artwork titled ‘of More Than Two  Minds’.43 Collins described the process he used:  I was using digital output in the early 1990s. My first  show,  entitled  ‘Digital  Rhetoric’,  was  in  1993  at  the  Lisa  Sette  Gallery  in  Scottsdale,  Arizona.  The  first   experiments  translating  3D  laser  scanned  heads  was  at least a year earlier than that. These sculptures were  produced  ‘subtractively’  using  CNC  milling.  The  RP  stuff  came  a  year  or  two  later  as  those  technologies  became  more  affordable  and  available.  I  started  a  lab  at  Arizona  State  University  in  1996  called  PRISM   Partnership for Research in Spatial Modelling  that had  one of the earliest 3D printers  RP  utilising a very BETA  inkjet droplet technology. A year later we took delivery  of an early Stratasys machine using Fused Deposition  Modelling.  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   33  33  9 26 17   3:42 PM   30  29  Christian Lavigne,  ‘Chant Cosmique’, 1994.

Jean-Claude  Andre.  It’s  important  to  know  that  the  stereolithography  process  was  simultaneously  invented  and  patented  both  in  France and USA.  Our  non-profit  association,  Ars  Mathematica,  was  founded  20  years  ago,  and  we  have  accumulated  considerable  knowledge  on  techniques  and  artists  of  this  new  discipline,  ‘Cybersculpture’.  We  organized  the  first  worldwide  computer  sculpture  exhibition  in  1993 at the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris, and then the  exhibition became the biennial ‘Intersculpt’. Personally,  I started to use the computer in art at the beginning of  the  1980s,  and  I  first  used  a  CNC  machine  in  1985.  In  1994,  I  materialized  the  first  digital  sculpture  in  France, with the help of the Ecole Centrale Paris and  the  Association  Française  de  Prototypage  Rapide.   Professor  Mary  Visser  teaches  sculpture  and  computer  imaging  at  Southwestern  University  in  Georgetown,  Texas.

I do not feel it is my place, nor  is it particularly relevant to this volume, to create a  complete list of all the artists who have filled the gap  between the late 1990s and up to the present day.  This  list  would  probably  run  to  hundreds  of  names  and  could  only  be  viewed  subjectively.  The  case  studies,  correspondence  and  interviews  compiled  herein have filled a gap and supplied some context.  Having passed the middle of the second decade  of the twenty-first century, there is little doubt that 3D  printing  processes  have  gained  a  much  wider  user  base  within  the  visual  arts.  A  series  of  processes  are now used in differing ways, dependent primarily  on discipline and, to a lesser extent, on the manner  in  which  individuals  interface  with  the  technology.  I  have  interviewed  artists,  makers,  designers  and  animators, amongst others, based on this evidence.  each  has  a  particular  view  of  the  technology,  but  there is much common ground. Generally, most are  still  somewhat  frustrated  that  the  technology  does  not  produce  an  article  with  the  material  properties  they would desire, and many are concerned that the  right materials are not even available.  An  ever-increasing  number  of  artists  and  designers are happy with the results they get. In the  design field, Freedom of Creation is a company that  produces furniture printed in nylon and Carbon Fibre;   31  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   35  35  9 26 17   3:43 PM   Marianne  Forrest  makes  and  sells  watches  printed  in titanium; Laura Alvarado prints brooches jewellery  that deliberately use the distinctive limitations of the  3D printing medium, making a virtue of the indistinct  qualities  of  scanning  and  the  textured  layering  of  powder deposition printing. In fact, Alvarado has said  that the newer forms of technology are actually too  smooth for her liking.45  I  myself  have  now  been  involved  with  the  technology  for  over  ten  years,  and  in  that  time  the  ability to print in 3D has come a long way. 3D printing  has  certainly  entered  the  public  imagination  during  that  time.  Its  history  to  date  has  become  clearer,  and there is an unfolding history yet to be told of the  developments that will occur over the next ten years.  32  Marianne Forrest, wall piece ‘Zephros’.

It covers both the  software and devices required to create a virtual model through to the types  of hardware currently available within additive manufacturing processes  3D  printing  that are required to create a printed physical output.   The  market  for  3D  printing  has  diversified  over  the  past  ten  years  with  ever  more  companies  and  machines  entering  the  market.  Therefore,  the  subtle  differences  and  nuances  among  the  rival  technologies and manufacturers have become more  difficult  to  discern,  especially  for  the  novice.  There  are also a number of different technologies that come  under the umbrella of ‘3D printing’ and a number of  alternative terms that refer to the process. To make  sense of the characteristics and differences, in this  chapter I will assume no previous knowledge on the  part of the reader.  The  collective  processes  now  defined  as  3D  printing  began  with  stereolithography,  which,  along  with  other  technologies  such  as  fused  deposition  modelling  FDM  and selective laser sintering  SLS ,  quickly  became  known  as  rapid  prototyping.  This  term became popular because the first commercially  available machine used a laser-cured or cross-linked   recently,   light-sensitive  photo-polymeric  material  to  quickly  make  prototypes  for  the  automotive,  aerospace,  medical engineering and industrial design industries.   The term ‘rapid’ is a relative term based upon the  slow speed of the previous, traditional model making  technologies.   Until  rapid  prototyping  was  an  apt  descriptive  term  for  the  collection  of  processes that grew around the technology, as rapid  prototyping was what these machines were designed  and used for. The term became less relevant as 3D  printing,  although  still  widely  used  for  prototyping,  more  recently  began  to  be  used  for  end-use  parts  in a few niche applications  e.g., for bespoke, high- value  items .  Furthermore,  in  addition  to  speed   of  which more later  the manufacturing process offered  other  benefits,  but  a  new  term  was  needed.  The  primary  candidates  that  emerged  were  ‘solid  free- form fabrication’, ‘rapid manufacture’, ‘additive layer  manufacture’  ALM  and ‘3D printing’.  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   37  37  9 26 17   3:43 PM   Rapid manufacture does not accurately describe  the process because, as we have said, it is far from  rapid. However, it is quicker than, for example, the  ‘tooling up’ used in conventional manufacture. Solid  free-form fabrication is accurate, but it is not a very  descriptive  term  of  what  actually  happens.  This  term is used because you can theoretically create a  complex, free-form object that is free from many of the  constraints of traditional fabrication processes  e.g.,  you  no  longer  need  to  consider  whether  the  object  can be released from a mould or whether a milling  cutter can get around the object . Beaman coined the  term solid free-form fabrication and says: ‘Solid Free  Form Fabrication is a set of manufacturing processes  that are capable of producing complex free-form solid  objects, directly from a computer model of an object  without part specific tooling or knowledge.’1  Additive  layer  manufacture   ALM   has  gained  a  lot  of  ground  because  it  is  more  accurate  and  descriptive of the actual process: All of the processes  do  manufacture  the  object  by  adding  one  layer  of  material  on  top  of  another.  Finally,  3D  printing  has  gained common parlance as, again, it is accurate and  describes  the  processes  well.  It  has  the  additional  benefit of relating to other parallel processes in the  2D  digital  print  field  –  for  example,  inkjet  printing  and  traditional  processes  such  as  lithography,  which already rest within general understanding and  common parlance. Within the engineering and higher- cost machine circles, ‘additive manufacturing’ is the  most commonly used term, often with the distinction  that it refers to the higher-cost machines while ‘3D  printing’ refers to the lower-cost machines and open  source technology. However, this view has not gained  credence in the rest of the world, and most people  now generically refer to all of the technologies as 3D  printing.  Fundamentally, the technology splits between the  hardware  and  the  available  software.  or,  to  use  a  more traditional analogy from conventional printing,  it  splits  between  capture creation  and  output.  If  one continues the traditional print analogy, then 3D  capture  is  equivalent  to  photography,  creation  is  equivalent to drawing software tools  such as Adobe  Illustrator®  and the final output is the digital print.  The only difference between traditional print and 3D  printing is that we have an extra dimension – namely,   38  the z-axis or physical height. Scanning an object in  3D is the equivalent of photography – with all of its  attendant  problems  post-capture.  However,  this  is  getting easier as the technology has improved. The  same analogy can be used for drawing tools. Initially,  artists  using  digital  printing  adopted  Photoshop  for  wide format printing or desktop inkjet printers as the  default software option. As a range of other design  technologies became available, such as laser cutting  and  textile  printing,  artists  began  to  expand  their  software  armoury,  and  vector-based  CAD  programs  have become increasingly important. In this chapter  I will briefly cover the types of scanning and current  design  technologies  available.  However,  because  this volume is primarily about the physical creation of  the artefact, I will leave a more detailed description  of  capture  and  3D  model  creation  to  others.  We  do,  however,  need  to  have  an  overview  of  what  is  involved  in  3D  printing  in  order  to  understand  the  whole process from conception to completion.  The 3D printing process chain  1  Table viewed from a corner, with 3 legs visible.   Peter McCallion.  To be able to print in 3D, you have to be able to think  in 3D. This might sound like a simplistic statement,  but it is the main thing that ‘trips up’ many people.  To  give  an  example,  if  one  views  a  table  from  the  corner where you can see only three legs, to be able  to draw a table in three dimensions, you have to be  aware that there is a fourth leg that is hidden from   9781474248679_txt_app.indb   38  9 26 17   3:43 PM   your view; otherwise, the table would not stand up.  There is little doubt that to be able to successfully  create  objects  from  scratch  using  a  computer  and  to model your own designs, you have to be able to  conceive and develop an understanding of the form  and  structure  of  what  you  will  finally  create.  The  easiest way of getting one’s mind around this is to  imagine  creating  your  object  within  a  transparent  cube. The bottom left hand front corner of the cube   object   50,50,50   z 50 units  z 50 units  y     5  0     u  n  it  s  x 5 0 u nits  origin  0,0,0   2  How coordinates are set in a three-dimensional box  for XYZ 3D spatial awareness.   Peter McCallion.  represents zero  0 . A numbered scale is then drawn  from the bottom left front corner to the bottom right  front corner, across the cube, from 0 to 100. This is  the x-axis. Imagine another numbered scale from the  bottom left corner to the back left hand corner at the  bottom, front to back, again from 0 to 100. This is  the y-axis. Finally, think of a numbered scale running  from the bottom left front corner to the top left front  corner, from 0 to 100. This is the z-axis. These three  scales will always refer back to the same point  0 .  Any point on an object drawn within this cube can  be assigned a number from each of the scales, so a  point at the dead centre of the cube would have the   reference x-axis 50, y-axis 50, z-axis 50. Therefore it  is possible to draw any object within the cube and all  points on the object will have a set of mathematical  coordinates  that  can  easily  be  digitised.  once  we  have  a  means  of  recording  the  coordinates  and  digitising them, it is then possible to go forward and  create a model or virtual object.  In  order  to  create  the  model  or  virtual  object,  unless  one  is  a  highly  sophisticated  programmer,  one  has  to  create  it  within  a  software  package.  This  is  usually  achieved  by  using  CAD  drawing  software, which is made up of a number of different  options  that  depend  primarily  upon  its  industrial  and  commercial  function.  The  basics  include  2D  drawing packages such as Adobe Illustrator®, Corel  Draw  and  AutoCAD®.  The  backbone  of  the  industry  is the engineering-based 3D solid modelling software  such as Pro engineer, SolidWorks and Pro Desktop.  The  software  favoured  by  many  artists  and  visually  oriented designers begins with 3D surface modelling  CAD software. examples include Rhino or Alias Studio  Tools. Additionally, there are a number of free ‘open  source’ software options – the common ones being  Google  SketchUp  and  Blender.  Unfortunately,  3D  drawing packages themselves represent one of the  entry barriers to 3D printing, as there is a relatively  steep  learning  curve  and  a  requirement  from  the  user to be able to think in 3D and extrapolate in their  minds what the 3D object will look and feel like  form  and function  when printed.  There  have  been  some  major  changes  in  the  software  environment  since  the  first  edition  of  this  book.  The  big  companies  such  as  Autodesk  have  made  their  professional  level  software  available  online as cloud subscription services. These include  Autodesk™  Fusion  360™  and  onshape™   this  software was created by a split from the team that  created  Solidworks™ .  In  some  cases,  individuals  can access them for free or at a lower cost than large  commercial users. This means that the ordinary person  now has access to industry standard software, rather  than  the  lightweight  freeware  programmes  such  as  Tinkercad and SketchUp. These online professional  programmes  have  all  the  reliability,  cross-platform  transferability  and  support  of  an  industry  standard  software.  All  of  this  makes  it  now  so  much  easier  for an individual to undertake professional-level CAD.  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   39  39  9 26 17   3:43 PM   Another factor that has changed is that many of the  big programmes now do very much the same things  – solids, surfaces and sometimes mesh editing, as  well – all within the same programme. Whereas in the  past  mesh  acquisition,  surface  design,  and  solids  engines may have been considered separately, they  are becoming available in one piece of software. It is  now difficult to predict, from an arts-based context,  which of the many professional software programmes  will be most future proof or offer the best options for  a creative approach. This could be one of a number  of  programmes,  including  Autodesk  Fusion  360™,  Rhino,  Solidworks™  or  the  new  onshape™   which  was the first serious cloud-based CAD .  A third factor that has changed is the advent of  direct  modelling  software.  Traditionally  in  CAD  one  makes 2D sketches and then uses those to create  3D models. Direct modelling starts with a 3D shape,  such  as  a  cube  or  sphere,  or  the  geometry  of  an  existing part, and then pushes or pulls its faces and  adds or subtracts geometry or features to create the  desired end result. Fusion 360™, SpaceClaim™ and  Creo™ all have some direct modelling functionality,  and others seem to be following suit.  It  will  be  interesting  to  see  if  this  addition  will  take off in a larger context. The transcription from a  2D sketch to a 3D model is familiar to the designer.  Direct  modelling  requires  a  different  approach  and  perhaps  also  a  different  way  of  thinking  about  the  way in which a 3D model is constructed.  3D scanning The other alternatives to CAD modelling the design  are  to  use  a  scanner  or  haptic  arm.  A  3D  scanner  will  create  a  ‘point  cloud’,  which  maps  the  surface  being scanned; the point cloud is then triangulated   i.e., turned into a mesh of triangles by the software .  3  Point Cloud capture from  a Z Corp Scanner viewed in  Geomagic™ software.

CFPR Archive.  often  scanners  will  only  scan  a  section  of  the  object  to  be  captured,  and  then  each  subsequent  section  has  to  be  stitched  to  the  previous  scan.  Finally, the whole scan has to be cleaned up to make  sure the model does not have overlapping triangles  and  that  there  are  no  holes  in  the  triangular  mesh  that  has  been  created.  If  these  remain,  then  the  scanned  object  will  not  transcribe  to  a  ‘watertight’  3D model without falling apart, or it simply won’t print  when the file is finally sent to the 3D printer.  The  cleaned  up,  scanned  file  then  has  to  be  converted into a suitable file for 3D printing. This is  not necessarily straightforward, because often all you  have is a single layer of a surface map set of triangles,  with no wall thickness or substance, so it is necessary  to create a wall or thickness to the object before it  can be printed. Practically, it is seldom a good idea to  create a completely solid object, for several reasons.  First,  there  is  cost  –  why  waste  material?  Second,  the weight of the object and its structural integrity are  not necessarily any better if it is solid. To overcome  this,  the  scans  have  to  be  imported  into  a  mesh- fixing software such as Geomagic™, which will fill in  the gaps in the mesh – and resolve other problems,  such as intersecting triangles. Then it is possible to  add the wall thickness, either in Geomagic™  if it is  a simple shape  or by converting it into a surface or  solid model in Geomagic™ so that the model can be   worked upon further in conventional CAD. Finally, the  file can be sent to the printer software to be rendered  into slices for printing.  Scanning  has  also  changed  in  the  last  three  years;  it  has  become  cheaper,  easier  and  faster.  So  scanning  technologies,  initially  only  available  at  the  high  cost  and  high  end,  have  filtered  down  to  the lower end of the market. In addition the software  has  improved  enormously  –  in  particular,  within  the area of mesh fixing. It is now possible to buy a  good  quality  scanner,  such  as  the  David™,  for  low  thousands  dollars or pounds . A few years ago one  would have paid much more for the same quality.  Scanners  come  in  several  forms.  The  simplest  is known as a contact scanner, such as the Micro- Scribe™, which is an articulated arm on a fixed base.  The  object  is  placed  upon  the  base  and  a  pointer  at  the  end  of  the  arm  is  brought  into  contact  with  the  object  to  be  scanned.  The  scanner  works  by  referencing  the  point  on  the  object  that  the  arm  is  touching  to  an  XYZ  zero  reference,  thus  plotting  each point of contact. As the arm is moved over the  surface, the points of contact are plotted to create  the  surface  model.  Contact  scanners  have  been  mostly replaced by white light or laser scanners.  By  contrast,  handheld  laser  scanners  such  as  the Fuel 30 tend to work by triangulation. A laser dot  or  line  is  projected  onto  the  object  to  be  scanned   9781474248679_txt_app.indb   41  41  9 26 17   3:43 PM   and  an  image  sensor,  measures  the  distance  to  the surface, by ‘time of flight’ or measures how the  laser line is deformed as it follows the surface of the  object. This measurement, sometimes coupled with  a series of reference dots, allows the device to orient  itself in relation to an XYZ zero point reference. The  dots assist the various multiple scans necessary to  be  stitched  together  to  capture  a  complete  object.  However,  laser  scanners  are  not  always  very  good  at  dealing  with  reflective  surfaces  and  objects  with  sharp edges because of the nature of capturing the  data  with  a  laser.  A  structured  light  scanner,  such  as  those  made  by  GoM   Gesellschaft  für  optische  Messtechnik  or the Artec eVA, projects a pattern of  light onto a subject and then records the deformation  of this pattern across the surface being scanned. This  may be achieved either by a single line or by a pattern  of lines or triangles projected to the surface and then  captured. Structured light is an accurate and fast way   of capturing surface detail, as the scanner records a  large amount of data at any one time.  The  other  means  of  creating  a  3D  model  is  through  a  haptic  arm.  A  haptic  arm  is  a  force  feed  back  device,  which  commonly  comprises  an  articulated arm with a pen-like user interface at the  end that attempts to recreate the sensation – the  look and feel – of physically sculpting an object. It  does this by constraining the movement of the arm  to  recreate  the  sensation  of  interacting  with  the  physical object, adding and subtracting  or pushing  and pulling  virtual material using a tool. The haptic  arm in some senses falls between a scanning and a  drawing program, in that it creates a representation  of the surface in relation to the pressure you apply  –  somewhat  like  a  three-dimensional  mouse  that  returns a feeling to the hand as you are drawing or  sculpting.  This  technique  has  been  referred  to  as  ‘virtual clay’ modelling.  Timeline of 3D machine DevelopmenT   Charles Hull’s  3D Systems  commercialise  the first  stereolithographic  machine  SLA 1  ,  solidifying thin layers  of ultraviolet  UV  light  sensitive polymer  using a laser.  Sony D-Mec  produce a  version of  stereolithography.  Three fundamental technologies are introduced:  1  FDM  fused  deposition modelling   by Stratasys extrudes  a hot melted plastic in  a thin bead to produce  parts layer by layer as  opposed to solidifying  parts by laser which  was the method of  previous systems.  2  Helisys create  LoM  layered object  manufacture . In the  Helisys process the  paper was unrolled  and then glued and cut  one layer at a time.  3  Cubital produce  SGC  solid ground  curing  in which the  whole layer was  flashed with UV light  to harden the polymer  through a series of  stencil masks created  by electrostatic toner  on a plate.  1987  1988  1989  1990  1991  1992  1993  Japan’s NTT  Data CMeT Inc.  commercialise  a version of  stereolithography.  electro optical  Systems  eoS   in Germany sell  the first Rapid  Prototype system.

This is the  first enclosed powder  binder machine   meaning that a  finished item can be  retrieved at the end of  the process .  Between 2007 and 2013 many of  the developments and patents in  the industry were not in the area  of new processes or machinery  developments but were primarily  concerned with improving materials.  Since 2012–13 the market   has gone through swift and  unpredictable changes. The basic  RepRap principle, developed by  Dr Adrian Bowyer at University of  Bath and first released as an open  source concept in 2007, created  an explosion of ever-cheaper  FDM machines under US$500,  which in turn created a massive  publicity cycle and resulted in 3D  printing featuring at the top of the  Gartner Hype curve. Much media  speculation followed regarding  how we would all soon have a 3D  printer at home to manufacture  anything we wanted. The largest  players in the market, 3D Systems  and Stratasys, started buying  up the most successful of the  home printer companies. In fact,  Stratasys even bought back their  own IP by buying Makerbot for  US$400 million. Slowly it dawned  on the wider populace that  cheap home 3D printers were an  unsustainable dream that was  unlikely to materialise.  43  9 26 17   3:43 PM  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   43   once the 3D model has been created, either by  modelling  or  scanning,  it  has  to  be  converted  into  a  format  that  the  3D  printer  driver  software  can  read.  This  usually  means  transferring  the  file  into  a  polygon  mesh  file   .STL ,  which  is  then  sliced  by  the 3D printer driver software. Most of the software  program discussed in this chapter will transcribe the  3D model file to STL format. The standard software  supplied with the 3D printer will then slice the STL  file and generate the necessary code to control the  3D printer hardware in order to build the object.  Having covered a wide range of the technical and  software  issues  surrounding  3D  printing  an  object,  we have reached a good point to return to the recent  history of 3D printing. The influential Wolhers report2  quantifies  both  the  size  of  the  3D  printing  industry  and  its  developments.  The  report  is  presented  annually by Terry Wolhers to the industry at the 3D  ‘RAPID’ conference and trade fair in the USA. During  writing  of  the  first  edition  of  this  book,  the  2012  report  had  just  been  released;  Wolhers  reported  the  industry  had  grown  24.1  per  cent  in  2011  and  was worth over US$1.714 billion  GBP1.08 billion .  By 2015 the market had more than doubled to over  US$4  billion  per  year;  Wolhers  predicts  the  market  will reach US$20 billion by 2020.3  In 2007 Wolhers4 produced an history of additive  fabrication,  and  updates  are  regularly  available.  I  will  summarise  the  main  points  of  this  history  in  terms  of  technical  machinery  development,  and  as  a  complementary  view  to  Beaman  and  the  history  discussed  in  Chapter  1.5  Wohlers’  is  perhaps  more  comprehensive;  the  report  lists  the  date  of  introduction  of  each  new  commercial  advance  and  machinery  introduction,  rather  than  presenting  a  timeline  of  patent  filing.  I  have  summarised  these  developments  below,  selecting  those  which  I  feel  are important to understanding how we reached the  current proliferation of machines.  As  a  consequence,  the  large  players  have  recently  dropped  manufacture  of  their  cheaper  home machines, with 3D Systems ceasing to make  the  Cube™  and  Cubex™  machines  and  Stratasys  outsourcing  the  production  of  the  Makerbot™  to  China. They are concentrating on their core markets  at the top end of the additive manufacturing industrial  market, where there is value in high cost machines   that will return income on investment. The lower end of  the market is now concentrated in small businesses  and  education  rather  than  the  much-vaunted  home  market. These areas are more discerning and need  greater reliability and functionality.  By  far  the  greatest  change  has  come  about  as  the  majority  of  the  original  patents  from  the  early  1980s  have  lapsed,  leaving  the  market  open  to  new  competition  that  takes  up  existing  technology  and produces ever cheaper versions of that locked  technology. The Charles Hull patents for the original  stereolithography process have ceased, as have the  Deckard patents for selective laser sintering  SLS .  This has led to a flood of new lower-cost printers that  have seriously challenged the bottom end of the 3D  print additive manufacturing market.  The current additive  manufacturing processes  I can only comment on those technologies that were  available and on the market in early 2016. This is not  an exhaustive list by any means. I have covered only  those developments that introduce a new process or  a means of manufacturing 3D print.  Stereolithography  SLA   SLA  machines  were  first  manufactured  by  3D  Systems.  The  original  technological  process,  as  described  in  the  first  1984  patent,6  consists  of  a  liquid  photo-polymeric  emulsion  in  a  bath  with  a  platform that sinks  or descends  through the bath,  one layer at a time.  The process begins with the platform positioned  just  below  the  surface  of  the  polymeric  emulsion.  The  first  layer  of  the  object  to  be  built  is  drawn  onto the surface of the emulsion by the light from  the  UV  laser,  curing  and  hardening  the  layer  by  cross-linking  the  photo-polymeric  emulsion,  which  becomes  solid  when  exposed  to  the  light  from  a  laser.  once  the  first  layer  is  complete,  then  the  platform is lowered and the process repeats for the  second layer, and then the whole process repeats  again  for  each  subsequent  layer,  until  the  object  has been fully built. Then the platform is raised to   44  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   44  9 26 17   3:43 PM   the  start  position  and  the  finished  object  can  be  removed  and  cleaned.  Stereolithography  requires  the use of support structures to aid the build, and  to  prevent  some  parts  falling  over  or  distorting  during the build process. These support structures  are built as part of the printing process in the same  material as the part and are removed after the part  has been built.  In 2014 the first patents issued to Charles Hull  in  1986  expired  and  therefore  it  was  possible  for  other machines to enter the market using the same  technology.  The  obvious  example  is  the  FormLabs  Form 1™ machine  now Form 2 . That was an early  kick-starter funded project, which initially challenged  the  Hull  patents  held  by  3D  Systems;  both  parties  agreed  to  an  accommodation  in  December  2013  before  the  patent  lapsed.  However,  the  result  is  that  it  is  now  possible  to  buy  a  stereolithography  machine for under US$3,000, with the proviso that  you always get what you pay for. This machine is not  the most strongly built and will wear very quickly as  a production machine. Competitors are beginning to  enter the marketplace, and it is hard to see how this  segment  of  the  market  will  progress.  Traditionally  it  has  been  the  domain  of  the  high-cost,  high-end  machines.  Fused Deposition Modelling  FDM   FDM  machines  are  manufactured  by  Stratasys,  3D  Systems and many others, with interesting variations  such  as  the  Rostock™  –  a  Delta  platform  that  has  three arms separate to the normal Cartesian platform   see  Glossary   usually  found  in  cheaper  machines.  FDM  is  the  most  common  3D  print  process,  partly  because the original patents have now run out and  partly due to the work of Dr Adrian Bowyer at Bath  University, and also because it is mechanically quite  simple  to  reproduce copy  FDM  technology,  when  compared  to  other  technologies  such  as  SLA  and  SLS, which use lasers and complex optics. Dr Bowyer  is the developer of the RepRap, a self replicating 3D  printer that is capable of self replicating some of its  parts. He made the plans for the manufacture of the  RepRap available as open source, generating a whole  new community of self-build 3D printing fabricators.  In essence, the FDM process, originally patented  by  Stratasys  in  1992,7  is  very  simple.  An  XYZ  Cartesian  platform,  in  itself  the  basis  of  all  3D  printing, with the addition of a heated head, deposits  a thin strand of melted plastic, one layer at a time.  It follows my simple analogy of the coil pot – except  this  version  is  plastic.

FDM  printers  will  use  a  variety  of  thermoplastic  build  materials,  including  ABS   Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene , Polycarbonates and  PPSU  Polyphenylsulfone , PLA biopolymer  Polylactic  Acid ,  thermoplastic  elastomers  such  as  NinjaFlex,  and  specialty  filaments  such  as  wood-polymer  ‘Laywood’ and metal-polymer ‘Bronzefill’ composites. The  mass  market  acceptance  of  machines  has  gone  over  the  top.  It  has  meant  there  is  a  much  greater  choice  of  materials  and  some  very  reliable  machines  such  as  the  Lulzbot™  and  Zortrax™  that  fall into the sub US$2,000  £1500  category, which  are being used both by industry and in education as  quick cheap prototyping machines.  These machines, combined with new online cloud  based software services, mean that a small business  can  have  access  to  a  quick  and  easy  prototype  solution that can be tried before sending the file to a  professional bureau service such as  iMaterialiseTM or  Shapeways™. A finished item made in metal or nylon  on a top-end professional machine can be created at  lower cost compared to even a few years ago. In 2016  BigRep™ have introduced a large-scale FDM machine,  with a print footprint of 1 metre × 1 metre × 1 metre.  Layered Object Manufacture  LOM   This is one of the earliest 3D printing technologies,  which was initially developed by Helysis Inc.™ USA,  who  manufactured  the  first  production  machine  in  1991.8 The early machines used a roll of paper that  was  rolled  out,  glued  and  laser  cut  for  each  layer.  Mcor is the current incarnation of the process, and  have  recently  launched  a  machine  that  again  uses  a paper roll – possibly because the Helisys original  patents have now run out. The Mcor™ process uses  single  sheets  of  standard  office  A4  paper,  which  creates  each  individual  layer;  each  sheet  is  glued  to  the  layer  below,  then  cut  one  at  a  time  with  a  knife, to slowly build the model. The printed model is  then cracked free from the final stack of paper. This  process has two advantages. First of all, the paper  acts as both the build material and support material;  second,  paper  is  a  very  cheap  build  material.  Therefore, although the initial cost of the machine is  quite high, the cost of building parts is comparatively  cheap.  Mcor  have  recently  offered  a  leasing  option  that includes all maintenance and materials to try to  launch the technology into the higher education and  small and medium enterprise  SMe  markets. Since  the  first  edition  of  this  book,  Mcor  have  produced  a printed colour process that first prints a stack of  A4 paper using a 2D printing process. The coloured  3D model is split into layers and then each layer is   46  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   46  9 26 17   3:44 PM   17  18  19  17  White Vanilla Icing printed by Peter Walters at CFPR.

The stack of paper is then fed into the 3D printer to  be glued and cut. The resulting 3D print comprises  a  full  colour-printed,  paper  3D  model.  The  results  are  very  impressive  given  the  low  cost  of  the  base  material, but at the time of going to press a costing  for the colour print element was not yet available.  The Mcor gained some traction in the education  market  because  of  its  leasing  policy,  whereby  an  educational institution could sign up to a complete  leasing package, including printer, maintenance and  materials, for a defined period without having to lay  out the full cost of a machine.  Powder Binder 3D Printing  Powder binder 3D printers are manufactured by 3D  Systems  who bought the Z Corp company in 2011    and Voxeljet™. Invented at MIT9 in the early 1990s,  this process uses a plaster-based composite powder  material in a bin, with a base that slowly drops one  layer at a time as the object is built. A parallel feed  bin full of new powder sits beside the build bed and  rises  up  to  present  new  powder  as  the  build  bed  drops. The object is built by inkjetting a binder into  the build bed one layer at a time. As the bed drops  after  each  layer,  a  new  layer  is  rolled  on  from  the  feed bin. To create a solid object, the inkjet binder  causes  a  reaction  with  the  plaster-based  powder  material and it hardens, thus creating a solid object.  When printing is finished, the build bed is raised and  the finished object is removed from the surrounding  powder. An advantage of this process is that it does  not require a separate support material, as the object  is supported in the bed by the surrounding powder,  which can be reclaimed and used again for a fresh  build.  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   47  47  9 26 17   3:44 PM   Another  advantage  of  this  process  is  that  is  possible to print in colour. In a multi-colour machine  the single monochrome inkjet head is replaced with  four  or  five  colour  heads,  which  print  either  CMY  or  CMYK  coloured  binders  as  well  as  clear  binder,  thus creating an object that has a three-dimensional  coloured  surface  to  the  printed  part.  Currently  the  3D Systems  Z Corp  machines are viewed by some  elements of the engineering community to be lacking  in accuracy and part strength and incapable of meeting  the necessary production tolerances. However, this  is to be expected as they were never intended to be  used by the engineering community for that purpose.   20  Z Corp 510 colour print machine at CFPR labs Bristol  21  22  23  48  21, 22, 23  Diagram showing  how a powder binder printer  deposits layers of powder and  inkjets the object.  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   48  9 26 17   3:45 PM   24  Ceramic-printed ‘Sugar Bowl’, designed by Denby Potteries and printed at CFPR.   CFPR Archive.  They are widely used in industrial design for concept  modelling and in the ceramic and footwear industries  as  prototype  design  tools.  They  are  used  in  the  ceramic industry because the 3D Systems  Z Corp   machines produce concept models in white plaster,  which  is  the  same  material  the  ceramic  industry  has  traditionally  used  for  its  concept  models,  from  which they create plaster moulds. A concept model  can be 3D printed in a matter of hours, compared to  hand crafting a plaster model, which may take days  or even weeks, so the 3D Systems technology is a  natural  choice.  The  footwear  industry  has  used  3D  Systems because they can print a design model in  colour, getting close to the final colours that will be  used in the shoe. This is now changing; the recent  Stratasys  objet  Connex and J750 series machines  also print in colour and soft and hard materials.  The  animation  industry  has  taken  to  the  3D  Systems   Z  Corp   technology.  LAIKA  Digital  in  Portland,  USA,  created  all  of  the  face  parts  for  their  stop  motion  animation  films  Boxtrolls  and  Paranorman using a full colour Z Corp Z650 machine.   However, LAIKA used the new objet J750 3 printers  that print in multiple colours for their latest film Kubo  and the Two Strings.10  Because 3D Systems Z Corp technology is based  on a plaster powder system and has therefore been  taken  up  by  the  ceramic  industry,  many  groups  have  undertaken  research  into  this  technology  for  developing ceramic 3D printing, including the original  inventors  of  the  process  Yoo  and  Cima  at  MIT,11  who  included  the  potential  for  this  in  their  original  patents.  David  Huson  and  I  have  also  developed  a  patented  system  at  the  University  of  the  West  of  england, Bristol,12 that has been successfully spun  out to industry through Argillasys Ltd and Viridis LLC. Recently Viridis – a company created by Jim Brett,  an original founder of Z Corp, and Will Shambley  ex  Z Corp  – have produced a new large scale powder  binder  printer  based  upon  a  commercial  six-axis  robot  that  seems  to  be  producing  good  results  for  the foundry casting industry and may indicate future  directions  for  3D  printers  with  greater  freedom  of  movement.  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   49  49  9 26 17   3:45 PM   25  Voxeljet  is  another  powder  deposition  system.  Whilst Voxeljet is based on an inkjet system licensed  from  the  original  MIT  patents,  contrary  to  the  3D  Systems technology, it uses a solvent-based binder  combined  with  either  a  polymer  powder  or  foundry  casting material. Because of the solvent binder and  the  large  size   4  ×  2  ×  1  metre   of  the  print  bed,  Voxeljet is used mainly in the casting industry.  Manufactured  by  eoS  in  Germany,  selective  laser sintered  SLS  powder is based on technology  patented  at  the  University  of  Texas,13  which  was  further  developed  by  the  DTM  Corporation  who  produced  a  production  machine  in  1992.  The  Fraunhofer Institute licensed the German research to  eoS.  A  bed  of  powdered  thermoplastic  material  is  fused by a Co2 laser, one layer at a time, with a new  layer of powder pushed by a roller onto the build bed  to create each new layer and at the same time support  the built object in the powder bed. The most common  of the SLS machines are manufactured by eoS and  these machines produce the most robust functional  and near-industry-ready parts in nylon. Some product  designers such as Assa Ashuach use eoS technology  for the manufacture of mass customised production  items  that  need  minimal  finishing  and  are  directly  printed and available for sale. However, the patents  held  by  the  DTM  Corporation  ceased  in  2014  and  already there are rumours of low-cost laser sintered  machines in the pipeline.  50  26  25  Voxeljet VX4000. Note the  build area of 4 x 2 x 1 metre,  which is the largest build area of  any 3D production machine.  26  eosint P800 laser sintered  nylon machine by eoS.  27  MTT Renishaw SLM 250 laser  sintered titanium machine by  Renishaw.  28  Detail of envisionTeC™  Perfactory Machine, opened to  show a printed part.  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   50  9 26 17   3:45 PM   Laser sintered titanium, stainless steel,  cobalt, chrome and gold  This  area  has  probably  progressed  the  most  since  the  first  edition  of  this  book,  with  the  aerospace  industry  reportedly  manufacturing  titanium  parts  that  are  actually  in  use.  Renishaw  have  printed  a  titanium frame for a bicycle, and dental implants are  increasingly 3D printed in metal.  Direct  metal  laser  sintering   DMLS   machines  are manufactured by eoS and Renishaw.  Renishaw  purchased MTT IN 2013.  This process is similar to  the  selective  laser  sintering  technology,  but  a  fine  metal powder is used instead of nylon. The model is  built layer by layer in the same manner as the SLS  machines. The powder is sintered and solidified by  a laser beam that moves over each layer. After each  layer  is  sintered,  a  new  layer  of  powder  is  applied  in  the  same  manner.  However,  unlike  in  polymer  powder SLS, in metal DMLS, support structures are  necessary to keep the model structurally stable and  supported during the build, to cope with overhangs  and  thin  walls.  This  system  is  capable  of  sintering  a  number  of  metals,  most  commonly  titanium  or  steel, but silver and most recently gold can also be  used in this process. There are also developments  in selective laser melting and laser fusing, which are  similar processes. Frank Cooper, Jewellery Industry   Innovation  Centre  at  Birmingham  City  University,  recently  explained  that  given  the  ever-increasing  price  of  gold,  to  be  able  to  create  a  gold  ring  with  this technology allows jewellers to print the ring with  a  hollow  internal  structure  and  a  series  of  ribbed  supporting  walls.  In  essence,  Cooper  can  create  a  ring that to all intents and purposes looks like any  other gold ring, except it is 70 per cent lighter – using  less than a third of the gold necessary for a solid ring  – with a very significant cost reduction.  one of the problems of the DMLS process, one  particularly common to artists and creative users, is  that  the  metal  support  structures  most  commonly  used  have  to  be  removed  manually.  Not  only  does  this  mean  lots  of  finishing,  but  metal  is  very  hard,  and it takes a great deal of time to remove and clean  up the parts. Cleaning and polishing is also a major  problem  because  the  parts  tend  to  come  off  the  machine with a matte surface that requires cleaning  and  polishing;  it  may  not  be  possible  to  reach  all  surfaces on a small complex part.  Digital light processing  The  digital  light  processing-based  3D  printer  is  manufactured by envisionTeC™. This process works  by projecting a silhouette image of each layer onto  a  photo-polymeric  material.  This  is  an  extremely   27  28  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   51  51  9 26 17   3:45 PM   29, 30  objet  Connex Machine and  two-colour output  29  30  accurate  technology  for  producing  small  parts  with  good  surface  finish,  as  the  build  layer  thickness  is  very  small.  It  has  been  extensively  used  by  the  hearing aid industry, as it can make custom parts to  fit individual ear shapes in a flesh-coloured material.  Interestingly,  this  ability  to  print  in  a  flesh-coloured  material has made the envisionTeC™ the machine of  choice for some parts of the stop motion animation  industry, and it was used by Aardman Animations for  their 2012 film Pirates.14 Aardman ran two machines  nonstop during filming to print over 500,000 different  parts.  They  also  made  the  YouTube  video  ‘Dot’  for  Nokia, which featured the smallest-ever stop motion  character.15  The  advantage  of  this  technology  is  that it exposes an entire layer at a time, making the  process fast and accurate for small-scale parts. The  Autodesk™ ember™ is a version of this technology  which is open source and available at lower cost than  industrial machines.  In  2015  both  Autodesk™  with  the  ember™  and  Carbon  3D™  have  manufactured  a  low  cost  DLP  machine.  It  remains  to  be  seen  whether  these  will  have  any  influence  over  the  envisionTeC™  market.  This  is  perhaps  a  slightly  different  scenario  to  the  FDM and SLA  stereolithography  markets, because  envisionTeC™’s  primary  customer  base  has  been  in the jewellery market, thus their customers make  small objects on a limited-size build platform. These  new machines are therefore direct competitors with  envisionTeC™   rather  than  being  small  desktop  versions  that  are  opposed  to  bigger  industrial  machines .  It  will  be  interesting  to  see  how  this  scenario develops in the future.  UV cured photo-polymeric inkjet deposition  The  UV  cured  photo-polymeric  inkjet  deposition  process  is  manufactured  by  objet.  owned  by  the  large conglomerate Stratasys, objet grew out of the  Israeli  inkjet  company  Scitex.  Scitex  created  the  groundbreaking  Iris  Printer®  –  a  continuous  inkjet  technology  –  in  the  late  1980s  and  early  1990s,  which revolutionised the inkjet market for artists and  without  which  there  would  have  been  no  epson  or  HP wide format printers. The objet technology draws  on this experience and has created a very accurate  process that uses a combination of inkjet technology  and UV curing. A photo-polymeric material is inkjetted  onto a bed, which is then cured with UV light one layer  at  a  time.  The  objet  system  creates  very  accurate  parts that have a high quality surface finish. Initially,  objet  offered  the  choice  of  either  a  hard  material  or  a  soft,  flexible  material.  More  recently,  they  have  launched  an  expanded  material  and  printing  technology  called  Connex™,  which  combines  the  ability to print both hard and soft materials, offering  users the ability to print a range of flexibilities and  different levels of hardness in the same 3D-printed  part.  The  latest  iteration  adds  full  colour  into  the  mix   J750  3D  Printer™ .  The  objet  system  prints  a  support structure in uncured resin, which surrounds  the  object  during  the  printing  process  and  is  then  washed away afterwards. once the support structure  has  been  washed  away,  you  are  left  with  a  finely  detailed finished part. Due to its detail and ability to  print fine layers and smooth surfaces without visual  stepping, objet was the 3D printing technology that   52  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   52  9 26 17   3:46 PM   was used in the first 3D-printed stop motion feature  film,  Coraline,  made  by  LAIKA  in  Portland,  USA,  in  200916  and  LAIKA’s  latest  film,  Kubu  and  the  Two  Strings.  Most recent developments one  of  the  newest  technological  developments  is  from  Hewlett  Packard,  based  upon  the  Thermal  inkjet  technology  they  developed  for  the  original  Thinkjet™ inkjet printers in 1984. HP have developed  a  machine   yet  to  be  released ,  which  they  claim  can build a part many times faster than any of the  current  technologies,  known  as  the  HP  Jet  Fusion  3D Printing Solution.17 HP claims that due to fused  inkjet technology, the printer will build faster, more  dimensionally stable objects more quickly and more  cheaply than any of its rivals. At the point of writing  this  second  edition,  the  author  has  yet  to  see  a  machine in action or any parts built by it.  At the time of writing objet have also launched a  new multi-colour Connex™ machine that prints in true  four colour with a white and clear medium. The initial  results seen by the author seem very impressive and  look to revolutionise 3D colour printing.  In addition, Disney Research have filed a number  of  patents  for  new  3D  printing  developments.  The  most significant is a patented method of 3D printing by  volumetric addition through selective curing of a fluid  matrix. This seems to be an extension of the original  stereolithography patents. Disney proposes to cure a  resin by the crossing of two lasers in a resin bath.  Bureau services  Many people predict that one of the future directions  of 3D printing will be through the continued expansion  of  bureau  services.  These  have  played  a  vital  role  since  the  early  days  of  rapid  prototyping.  More  recently,  the  presence  of  Internet-based  bureaus  such as Shapeways™ and iMaterialise™ have given  these companies access to a wider customer base  and have enabled them to dominate the market. It  is  already  possible  to  send  a  file  over  the  Internet  exploiting printers situated throughout the world and  within a few days receive the complete and finished  3D-printed part through the post. The parts can be in   any  number  of  materials,  from  full-coloured  plaster  or  various  forms  of  plastic  and  nylon  to  ceramic,  titanium, steel and silver.  It is becoming increasingly popular for artists and  designers  to  use  a  bureau  service  to  produce  their  work, and for good reasons: There are no capital costs  involved,  no  machinery  to  maintain  and  no  need  to  upgrade to new technology whenever a new machine  comes out. Recently, due to economies of scale and  buying  power,  the  cost  to  send  a  part  to  a  bureau  service has become cheaper than that of an owner of  a single machine buying the materials to run it.  In fact, if one factors in depreciation and the cost  of  wasted  materials,  it  is  definitely  cheaper  to  use  a  good  bureau  service  than  to  run  the  machinery  yourself. However, one must bear in mind that these  services place severe restrictions on what they will  print. For example, they will not accept files if walls  are too thin nor will they produce delicate parts that  may  break  during  manufacture  or  when  removing  the parts from the machine and cleaning up. These  services  need  to  be  able  to  turn  parts  around  quickly; it is possible to find services that will take  the  time  and  trouble  over  difficult  parts  –  but  at  a  cost!  A  pragmatic  approach  for  artists,  designers  and  makers  is  to  iteratively  develop  and  prototype  a design using a home or locally based, low-cost 3D  printer.  Then,  once  the  design  reaches  a  stage  at  which the designer is happy with it, the 3D model is  sent to a bureau to be fabricated in one of a much  wider range of available materials processes.  on their website, the industry forum Rapid Today  lists over 600 3D print service suppliers throughout  the  world.  Nearly  all  of  these  services  serve  the  industrial  and  engineering  sectors;  some  serve  designers  and  architects.  In  england  alone  it  lists  nearly fifty 3D print services, and there are several  more unlisted. Consequently, I will try to document  only  those  bureaus  and  centres  that  have  some  previous experience of working with artists and have  made a contribution to the field in terms of pushing  the  boundaries  of  arts  practice  or  being  a  central  location where arts practice may be found. A more  comprehensive  list  of  available  services  may  be  found  from  the  Rapid  Today  website.18  Therefore,  let’s  call  this  list  ‘the  primary  players  from  a  UK  perspective’.  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   53  53  9 26 17   3:46 PM   Shapeways™  Shapeways™ was started by Peter Weijmarshausen  within the lifestyle incubator of Phillips in eindhoven,  Holland, in 2008. In 2010, venture capitalists Union  Square19  and  Index  Ventures  financed  a  move  to  New  York,  where  Shapeways™  have  grown  into  the  largest  global  3D  printing  service.  According  to  a  recent  Forbes  article:  ‘Shapeways  has  built  the  world’s largest marketplace for 3D printable objects  and makes thousands of unique objects every day.’20 Shapeways™  tend  to  be  the  port  of  call  for  smaller  objects.  They  run  a  very  accessible  front  end  to  their  website,  powered  by  software  that  will  assess your CAD model automatically and inform you   of its suitability for printing and the cost. Alongside  their  printing  services,  Shapeways™   in  line  with  similar bureaus  run an online shop where you can  buy  designs  from  anyone  who  cares  to  post  them  on the site. Shapeways™ will then print and deliver  the  part  for  you.  Currently,  Shapeways™  have  over  6,000  independent  designers  selling  their  own  products  and  have  printed  over  one  million  items  since  their  inception.  They  feature  well-known  3D  print designers and artists on their website, such as  Bathsheba Grossman, who makes mathematical art  pieces, and Nervous System™, who make generative  work based around natural forms. Shapeways™ have  grown from strength to strength and now dominate  the bureau market in the USA.  31  54  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   54  9 26 17   3:46 PM   iMaterialise™  iMaterialise™ specialise in working with artists and  designers.  They  run  an  online  gallery  service  very  similar  to  Shapeways™  but  also  deal  with  larger  specialist  artworks.  For  example,  they  printed  the  recent  Iris  Van  Herpen  catwalk  collection  ‘Hybrid  Holism’.  iMaterialise™  also  print  a  wide  range  of  materials,  from  plastics  to  ceramics  and  metals.  iMaterialise™  is  part  of  the  Belgium  company  Materialise  MGX  who are one of the largest players  in  the  industry,  developing  3D  print  software  and  serving  the  engineering,  industrial  design  and  medical industry sectors.21  3T RPD™  3T RPD22 are primarily a bureau for the engineering  industry,  including  the  aerospace  automotive  and  defence  sectors.  However,  they  also  work  with  architects and designers, such as Lionel Dean, Assa  Ashuach  and  Alexandra  Deschamps-Sonsino,  and  artists, such as Heather and Ivan Morison.  one example of 3T RPD printing for artists is the  Installation  ‘Little  Shining  Man’.23  3T  RPD  worked  with  Queen  and  Crawford  Design  studio  to  realise  this work produced by the artists Heather and Ivan  Morison. The design of the structure is based around  the tetrahedral kites of Alexander Graham Bell, which  were then multiplied out into colliding cubes based  on cubic formations of the mineral pyrite. Queen and  Crawford  designed  a  nylon  joint  system  that  would  handle every connection in the composition. Working  closely with 3T RPD in Newbury, the 6,000 individual  joints  were  built  using  their  SLS  technology  and  printed in nylon.  The kites were then fabricated from carbon fibre  rod  and  cuben  fibre,  a  handmade  composite  fabric  used  primarily  in  racing  yacht  sails.  This  achieved  the perfect combination of strength and weight. The  visual  impact  of  the  fabric  produced  an  ethereal  sense  of  depth  and  refraction  that  gives  the  heavy  mass the lightest touch.  The kite shown is one section of an arrangement  of three that come together to create the final piece  of sculpture that is suspended in an atrium at Castle  Quay in St. Hellier.

In the  last  few  years  they  have  run  a  specialist  bureau  and  consultancy  service  for  artists,  designers  and   As I said in the introduction, it is difficult to see where  the technology will go in the next few years, but my  guess is that it will split into a number of different  markets. The high-end machinery will be used by the  top end of the engineering and aerospace markets,  and it will also be used for high-value bespoke markets  such  as  medical,  dental,  sports  equipment  and  jewellery. In the middle will be the bureau services. I  have no doubt that, given the high cost of the quality  machinery the bureau services can provide, they will  continue to service those who need to keep costs to  a minimum through economies of scale.  In 2012 I wrote that the low-end machines would  remain in two forms, with the very cheap machines  likely  to  enter  the  toy  market.

In  2017,  I  think  a  future  toy  market  is  unlikely  –  or  at  least  I  have not seen a small reliable machine marketed in  the right way. The low-end ‘geek and maker’ market  has matured and expanded to a much more tailored  and selective audience. There has been a realisation  that this is a specialist market that requires a much  more sophisticated user who is happy to tinker with  and  nurture  a  machine.  A  plug-and-play  solution  is  a  long  way  from  realisation  and  may  not  ever  be  achievable at a low enough cost. However, some of  the most recent developments in lower-cost printing  are quite close to being plug and play  e.g., Lulzbot  is one example that worked ‘straight out of the box’ . If the market desires a better quality part, most  will  first  trial  it  on  a  cheap  machine  to  make  sure  it  works  and  is  watertight  and  then  send  it  to  a   bureau  for  a  high-quality  part  in  a  known  material.  Some of those materials are already available, such  as  titanium,  steel,  silver  and  gold,  with  a  range  of  plastics, including nylon and photopolymer materials  that  simulate  the  performance  of  ABS  and  rubber.  other  materials,  such  as  aluminium,  may  never  be  used  in  3D  printing  because  of  health  and  safety  concerns.  Materials  are  set  to  improve  –  in  terms  of strength, durability and quality of surface finish –  and a wider range of materials will become available,  including  materials  with  thermal  and  electrical  conductivity  for  functional  applications  such  as  3D-printed  electronics  –  for  example,  optomec  and  Voxel8. Deposition technology will improve in quality  and  the  cost  of  mid-range  printers  will  continue  to  fall.  Multiple  material  printers  will  slowly  enter  the  medium and lower cost sectors.  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   57  57  9 26 17   3:46 PM   3  Crafts and craftspeople  This chapter will primarily examine craftspeople and how they interface with  3D printing. I will explore how the technology is changing the concept of  craftsmanship with thoughts, observations and case studies.  I wrote in 2013 that whilst it is difficult to come up  with  any  firm  evidence  or  overall  statistics,  I  feel  that  3D  printing’s  influence  should  and  will  have  a  fundamental  impact  on  the  area  of  ‘making’  that  has been traditionally known as the ‘crafts’. I argue  that  until  very  recently,  this  area  of  the  visual  arts  has had the lowest public profile for adopting digital  technology – apart from a few rare examples such as  the work of Michael eden.  In  contrast,  throughout  2011  there  were  a  plethora  of  digitally  oriented  craft  exhibitions  and  curated  shows  that  included  3D  printing,  such  as  the  Crafts  Council  touring  show  ‘Lab  Craft:  Digital  Adventures  in  Contemporary  Craft’1  and  the  ‘Power  of Making exhibition’2 at the V&A Museum, London.  These exhibitions began to tackle the problem of how  we move beyond the virtual screen representation of  an artefact to how we create it in the physical world  using digital technology.  These  exhibitions  seem  to  have  ridden  a  wave  of  change  in  both  technology  and  the  attitude  of  contemporary  makers  who  are  adopting  the   possibilities  of  printing  in  ‘real’  materials  such  as  metal,  ceramics  and  soft  colourful  plastics.  These  possibilities  changed  again  in  late  2013  and  early  2014 as a result of the ‘out of Hand – Materialising  the Post Digital’ exhibition  curated by Ron Labaco   that  took  place  at  the  Museum  of  Art  and  Design   MAD  in New York. ‘out of Hand’ firmly tied craft skill  to digital technology and methods of making.  I also noted in 2013 that when showing a craft  object, the knowledge and craft skill inherent in the  work is a crucial part of exhibiting it. At that point most  3D-printed  artworks  lacked  any  of  those  inherent  properties or tacit knowledge that is fundamental to  a craft piece. I was not sure if either the artists or  the  curators  were  able  to  be  sensitive  in  retaining  the  tactile  properties  of  conventionally  formed  materials. By this I mean that the problem is inherent  in manufacturing or displaying the 3D-printed artefact  in  a  manner  that  would  normally  be  central  to  the  core essence of any traditionally crafted object. This  is a new area of working through a process. To 3D  print a successful artwork requires a high degree of   58  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   58  9 26 17   3:46 PM   1  Michael eden, ‘Wedgwouldn’t Tureen’, silver test.   Michael eden, courtesy of Adrian Sassoon.  skill, but at the moment the material properties deny  the craft skill.  However, this is no longer entirely true, as I write  this revised edition in 2016, when material such as  3D-printed metal has progressed substantially. Whilst  there is a much wider choice of other materials, they  have  not  undergone  the  same  radical  changes  as  metals.  I  also  wrote  that  3D  printing  presents  not  only  a  physical  disconnect  between  the  maker  and  the  object,  but  also  has  the  added  disadvantage  that  this  physical  disconnect  is  mediated  yet  further  through the digitisation process. By this I mean one  first draws a virtual representation on screen, which  is  the  first  disconnect,  then  one  sends  this  virtual  object to the printer, where there is also a physical  disconnect  between  the  creator  to  the  object’s   manufacture – making the object twice removed from  its creator. Whilst this largely still holds, the work of  artists such as Jonathan Monaghan and craftspeople  such  as  Jack  Row  and  Michael  eden  mitigate  this  view. In my opinion, recent changes in the visual arts  specifically,  in  both  3D  printing  and  the  related  3D  software, are moving from the initial ‘early adopter’  stage to the more skilled mainstream craftsperson.  These  very  attributes  of  3D  printing  lead  us  to  the  following  questions:  First,  is  there  a  ‘craft  of  the  digital’?  And  second,  how  do  we  reconcile  the  craftsperson’s tacit understanding of materials with  a process that removes the union of hand and eye  normally associated with a craftsperson using a tool? It  is  this  tacit  understanding  of  materials,  only  gained  by  the  acquisition  of  knowledge  through  practice, that is essential to the creation of any good   9781474248679_txt_app.indb   59  59  9 26 17   3:46 PM   quality  artefact  to  which  we  might  ascribe  a  high  degree of skill, whether it is a fourteenth-century tin  glazed Majolica bowl from Deruta in Italy or a table  from the contemporary furniture maker Fred Baier.3  In  this  chapter  I  hope  to  present  a  series  of  examples  and  case  studies,  which  will  prove  that  in fact a number of people may have already solved  these  problems  and,  if  they  have  not  completely  solved them, they have at least found solutions that  work for them.  However,  to  return  to  the  fundamental  problem  or  dichotomy:  the  issue  is  the  reconciliation  of  learned tacit knowledge of materials, essential in the  creation  of  a  quality  artefact,  in  any  manufacturing  process   whether  analogue  or  digital   as  against  a  3D printing process that removes and automates the  essential coordination of hand and eye.  Additionally,  3D  printing  lays  down  a  material  in a new way, a way that bears little relation to the  processes that have been used in the past to create  an artefact. At this point I may be opening myself up for   criticism for holding what in some circles may be seen  as an old-fashioned view: I firmly believe in a visual  aesthetic and the need to learn craft skills in order to  create art of value that combines both an appreciation  of  form  and  content.  I  am  in  the  same  camp  as  Richard  Sennett  in  his  treatise  ‘The  Craftsman’  in  that I believe these skills have to be learnt by familiar  understanding and repetition of practice.  All  craftsmanship  is  founded  on  skill  developed  to  a  high  degree.  By  one  commonly  used  measure,  about  ten  thousand  hours  of  experience  are  required  to  produce  a  master  carpenter  or  musician.  Various  studies show that as skill progresses, it becomes more  problem attuned, like the lab technician worrying about  procedure, whereas people with primitive levels of skill  struggle more exclusively on getting things to work.4  How do I believe that the field of the crafts will deal  with this problem and adopt these new technologies?  I may need to qualify here what I mean by adoption.   2  Workshop of Giacomo  Mancini, majolica bowl,  1520–50. Tin-glazed  earthenware, painted with  colours.   V&A Images,  Victoria and Albert  Museum  2595-1856 .  60  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   60  9 26 17   3:46 PM   I have stated elsewhere that I do not believe that the  early adoption of a process is representative of a new  field. early adopters tend to create artefacts that, at  best, look as though they have been created with a  very specific technology – an instantly recognisable  technology  –  which  they  are  using  for  the  sake  of  using  and  not  as  a  means  of  communicating  an  idea through an appropriate tool. In my opinion the  most innovative works are created when 3D printing  technology  becomes  more  commonplace  and  then  the  images,  objects  and  artefacts  are  made  using  the technology simply as a means to an end and not  as a means to represent the process or technology. To illustrate this, I constantly compare 3D printing  to  the  development  of  inkjet  printing  in  the  1990s,  which  went  through  a  similar  new  technological  adoption  process  to  which,  in  the  beginning,  only  a  few had access. Then the adoption travelled through  increasing improvements and developments to a state  of familiarity, ubiquity and finally, acceptance. Inkjet  printing is now a fully accepted part of the canons of  printmaking and photography. Artists and craftspeople  make work using an inkjet process that is common to  everyday practice and therefore ‘familiar’.  This same adoption process is yet to happen with  3D  printing,  and  craftspeople  need  to  understand   that adoption of new technology is not a negation of  craft skills – quite the opposite. It is not possible to  take on a new manufacturing technology without an  inherent understanding of materials. I see the rise of  this technology in the same vein as the introduction of  mechanisation into the crafts during the Victorian era. This is perhaps best summed up by George Sturt  in  his  famous  text5  The  Wheelwrights  Shop,  which  documents  the  period  between  1884  and  1891  when farm carts were still wholly made by hand, just  before  the  general  acceptance  of  machinery  into  the trade. This wonderful book makes the argument  for an understanding of materials in order to make  the best quality artefacts. Sturt’s employees had a  complete and tacit knowledge of all of the elements  that went into growing, harvesting and seasoning the  locally sourced timber they used.  However,  we  live  in  a  different  world:  The  knowledge required of today’s skilled craftsperson is  very different from the craftsperson of the past, and  this knowledge will face rapid change in the future.  So,  just  as  in  Sturt’s  time,  when  the  knowledge  and  skill  base  that  had  not  changed  for  centuries  changed rapidly within a few years, we too may now  experience similar rapid change, engendered by the  introduction of a disruptive technology.  3  Sturt’s Wheelright’s Shop, Farnham, Surrey, 1916.   Sturt 1923.  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   61  61  9 26 17   3:46 PM   4  Side view of a handmade  cart from Sturt’s Wheelright’s  shop.   Sturt 1923.  Sturt  describes  the  transition  of  his  family   business to mechanisation:  But eventually – probably in 1889 – I set up machinery:  a  gas  engine,  with  saws,  lathe,  drill  and  grindstone.  And this device, if it saved the situation, was  as was  long afterwards plain  the beginning of the end of the  old style of business, though it did just bridge over the  transition to the motor-trade of the present time.6  What  is  interesting  here  is  that  all  of  the  machinery  Sturt  describes  is  a  vital  part  of  the  modern  craftsperson’s  toolkit.  In  fact,  many  craft  woodworkers  making  furniture  today  –  in  addition  to  being  completely  au  fait  with  powered  hand  and  machine tools – would also possess a CNC router.  The crux of this argument is simply that the adoption  of new technology requires a new set of skills, without  throwing  out  the  skills  and  material  knowledge  inherent in all of the previous technologies. Crucially,  it requires an understanding that these technologies  are  no  more  and  no  less  than  a  new  set  of  tools  that require time to become familiar with. What they  should  not  do  is  dictate  the  practice.  All  too  often  with  the  adoption  of  new  technology,  in  whatever  discipline,  one  can  instantly  tell  a  work  that  has  been dictated and created by the simple constraints   of a process. It will not possess any of the inherent  material or aesthetic qualities that are obvious in a  piece that is made so skilfully that it transcends the  process.  one  instantly  looks  at  the  content  whilst  fundamentally understanding the level of skill that is  required  to  create  the  piece  and  without  having  to  question its integrity or imperfections. For example,  compare  the  classic  Arne  Jacobson  bent  plywood  butterfly chair, which demonstrates inherent material  qualities, and the low-cost IKeA Vilmar chair, which is  built to a price point.  Sturt  presents  us  with  a  further  problem.  His  descriptions of a tacit understanding of materials are  both insightful and unusual, in that he has real insight  and  practical  knowledge  of  his  subject  combined  with  the  unusual  ability  to  write  and  explain  the  view  and  understanding  of  a  practitioner.  However,  Sturt  is  writing  about  the  transition  from  handcraft  to the advent of mechanisation  but at this point in  history  machines  were  still  very  ‘hands-on’ .  What  we are dealing with today is the transition from what  we  consider  to  be  a  ‘hands-on’  approach,  to  what  can  only  be  described  as  a  ‘hands-off’  or  ‘remote  mechanisation’  approach.  Therefore,  is  it  possible  to  use  Sturt  as  an  analogy  for  tacit  understanding,  even  when  he  is  decrying  the  process  we  are  in  the  transition  from!  I  believe  that  the  fundamental   62  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   62  9 26 17   3:46 PM   borders between disciplines.  Here I will also blame  myself  for  the  individual  chapters  in  this  book  that  define  disciplines  by  chapter  heading,  when  personally I do not agree that there have to be any  boundaries!  However, there is no doubt that under  the  broader  definition  of  ‘craftsperson’  people  are  integrating with the technology. examples include the  design collective Nervous System and the designer  Bathsheba Grossman, who has been making metal  and plastic jewellery for a number of years.  Again,  the  real  test  comes  when  the  objects  transcend the process involved. In fact, in my view,  the above examples illustrate the early adoption of  the process very well. Both of these examples utilise  mathematic  algorithms  to  generate  natural  forms,  which  are  then  3D  printed.  This  makes  use  of  a  factor of the technology that is immediately available  and inherent to the way objects are conceived. The  downside of this approach is that objects created are  completely subservient to the process, and therefore  instantly recognizable as 3D printed.  tenet  of  Sturt’s  argument  still  holds  true  in  2017,  and it could offer further insight: During a period of  transition,  the  comparisons  that  are  made  to  the  new  technology  from  the  point  of  view  of  the  old,  by  their  very  nature,  tend  to  be  negative.  As  the  technology  matures,  a  more  rational  understanding  and acceptance grows until we reach the stage, as  described above with digital inkjet technology, of its  commonplace integration into everyday practice.  Philosophically,  I  understand  the  problem  for  the  craftsperson  at  this  point  in  the  development  of 3D printing. By the very nature of the 3D printing  process,  the  range  of  materials  available  to  the  user is still extremely limited and primarily does not  exhibit  any  of  the  characteristics  available  in  the  standard  materials  used  in  the  broader  disciplines  of the skilled crafts. Why, therefore, use a process  that  offers  none  of  the  qualities  inherent  to  your  discipline?  The  answer  of  course  is  that  3D  printing  offers  the ability to create objects that would be impossible  to create in any other way, and this is the solution  to the dichotomy. Whilst the quality of material often  leaves a great deal to be desired, what can be done  with the process is very seductive. However, has this  also now become a cliché or gimmick: the impossible  object?  Maybe  practitioners  are  beginning  to  work  through  this  gimmicky  phase  in  the  same  way  that  they  did  when  inkjet  printing  was  a  novel  and  seductive  process,  during  which  time  there  were  a  huge  plethora  of  Photoshop  gimmicks  that  have  now died away. As is common across all of the arts  disciplines,  most  participants  are  waiting  for  the  technology to take off. only then will it be possible  to marry the abilities of ‘print-on-demand’ in shapes  that  are  integral  to  the  3D  printing  process,  with  materials that have the inherent qualities required by  the artist craftsperson. This means the objects will  be aesthetically pleasing in themselves and will not  exist merely as an expedient means of laying down a  track to create a 3D print. Thus finally, we will create  objects in ways not currently possible – objects that  possess the inherent material qualities so desirable  to the experienced craftsperson.  Having  argued  that  craft  is  in  transition,  there  is  no  doubt  that  craftspeople  have  been  using  the  3D  print  process  and  there  is  much  blurring  of  the   5  Nervous System, ‘Hyphae Cuff’. Photographs by Jessica Rosenkrantz.     Nervous System.  63  9 26 17   3:46 PM  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   63   In  the  case  studies  below  I  have  interviewed  people  from  diverse  crafts  backgrounds  who  have  dealt  with  the  problems  of  limited  materials.  each  has  a  very  different  and  particular  approach  to  using 3D printing: Michael eden has a background  as  a  practicing  ceramicist.  Jack  Row  is  a  jeweller  who  has  used  3D  modelling  since  he  was  at  university. Marianne Forrest is primarily a clock and  watchmaker.  I  also  wanted  to  interview  people  who  used  3D  printing  technology  in  very  different  ways.  Jack  has  an extremely hands-on, do-it-yourself approach, that  starts with 3D modelling and 3D printing of moulds  followed  by  hand  finishing  and  embellishment.  At  first glance there may seem to be distinct similarities  between  Marianne  Forrest  and  Jack  Row,  but  their  approaches are very different.  Marianne  Forrest  uses  the  technology  as  much  as a designer as a craftsperson, in the sense that  it is a tool to enable her to achieve a desired result  and it was not until she could print in metal that she  began to use the technology.  Jack  Row’s  use  of  3D  print  technology  is  more  direct and primarily the finished article is not in itself  3D printed, as is the case with both Marianne Forrest  and Michael eden.  Michael eden’s main aim, in his own words, is:  To communicate an idea or tell a story in the form of  a three-dimensional object and in order to do that in a  lyrical  way  I  choose  the  appropriate  tools.  It  does  not  matter to me whether they are a computer, the potter’s  wheel, the 3D printing machine or the kiln; they are all  tools and require a degree of craft skill to do the job well.  CAse sTuDy  JACK ROW  Jack  Row  was  born  in  Nottingham,  england.  After  completing an apprenticeship in traditional goldsmithing,  he  began  studying  in  2005  at  the  Birmingham  School  of  Jewellery  on  a  Higher  National  Diploma   HND   jewellery and silversmithing course. Following successful  graduation in 2007 and winning a number of awards, he  entered employment for one of europe’s leading jewellery  manufacturing  companies,  as  a  designer  of  bespoke  products. experimenting with the application of computer  aided design  CAD  technology, Jack became fascinated  with its potential for the creation of innovative, exciting  products.  Returning to study at BCU in 2008, he began to combine  his traditional skills, learned as an apprentice, with the  innovative application of CAD and RP  rapid prototyping   technologies.  on  graduating  Jack  won  the  coveted  British Jewellers Association prize for his precious metal  fountain  pen  design  concept.  Six  months  later,  he  was  awarded a Gold Medal prize by the Worshipful Company  of Goldsmiths, one of the established Livery companies  of London, for his ‘Architect’ prototype fountain pen, in  sterling silver, based upon the original design concept.  64  6  Jack Row, Architects Pen  with diamonds, silver and gold.  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   64  9 26 17   3:46 PM   The Architect Collection debuted at Harrods in November  2011  and  has  since  become  the  designer’s  most  celebrated  work.  Jack  continues  to  build  a  relationship  with Harrods, offering its discerning customers the best  in luxury British design and craftsmanship. Furthermore,  the  two  brands’  key  strengths  of  quality,  innovation,  service and British eccentricity perfectly align.  When I asked Jack how he would describe his professional  practice  –  for  example,  designer,  artist,  jeweller  or  a  craftsperson – he replied:  I would say all of the above, really. Unfortunately,  I don’t think I fit neatly into any single part of  the definition. I'm hard to pigeonhole. For my  personal practice, calculating the lowest common  denominator, of all those disciplines, I would  probably say I’m a goldsmith and all those other  things are part of my practice.   Jack first started 3D printing around 2006, at university,  using Rhino. He says that most of the universities taught  Rhino at that time, and everything he does involves 3D  printing to a greater or lesser extent:   —   —   It’s economical. I can design and develop  an item in 3D first, generally shortening the  development process, as I can visualise how  all the components fit together on screen. This  reduces the volume of models and prototypes  needed, before you get to the end product.  Design development is one of the most costly  and time-consuming aspects of this business.  Secondly, it’s great for visualising ideas for  clients. If a customer isn’t quite sure or they  need a bit more information to make that  commercial ‘leap of faith’ – I can provide them  with a realistic render and or a three-dimentional  print of the design first, helping them to be  confident they will be happy with the eventual  finished piece. Furthermore, because the  materials I work with have a high intrinsic value,  if the design isn’t quite what they were expecting  and needs tweaks, it’s much easier and more  economic to make alterations at this stage. I  also take pleasure using CAD and 3D printing, so  there’s that selfish reason too. As I was brought  up playing 3D computer games, you could argue  that I have been using CAD-like software since  I was about ten years old. You could make the  point that it’s perhaps a generational thing.   7  Jack Row, Gothic Fountain Pen  Us early gamers find it easier to work with 3D  modelling software, as a result. Not everybody,  certainly – but it is a trend I’ve noticed with my  CAD students. The other immense thing about  3D printing, for me, is accuracy. Especially with  the work that I do  which you could argue is  very small scale engineering  tolerances are all  important, as well as symmetry. The magic of  the mirror and rotate functions helps enormously  with this. If you can imagine making, for  example, a pair of earrings, one item has to be  an exact mirror image of the other. After creating  one earring, it’s just a few clicks to create its  counterpart. There are obviously always slight  differences and degradations between virtual  models and the finished piece, due to the  nature of casting, hand fabrication and finishing,  especially in the post processing of the piece.  A CAD file can be 100% accurate but as with  any art or craft, only as good as the individual  creating it. CAD however does not provide a  safety net for mistakes or increase the technical  and artistic ability of the user – it’s not a magic  bullet for designers. CAD certainly still seems to  get a pretty bad rap, especially in this industry –  its widespread use in jewellery design is still fairly  recent, and if you go on any social media there’ll  be someone saying it's cheating or it’s ‘not how it  was in my day’ and so on.   This  consolidated  my  own  views  about  this  kind  of  argument  and  we  discussed  The  Wheelwrights  Shop,  mentioned above. Jack replied,  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   65  65  9 26 17   3:46 PM   printing, but sometimes, if the original master  is 3D printed – if I was creating a cufflink that  was 3D printed – I might cut a mould of it,  which is quite a traditional process. In essence  you’re watering down the amount of 3D printing  involved in making the production run. It’s hard  to quantify, really.   This  confirms  the  view  that  3D  printing  is  about  so  much more than just ‘press a button’ and a fully formed  object pops out – there’s a huge amount of finishing and  cleaning  up  of  the  piece  that  requires  a  knowledge  of  traditional craft skill, even without factoring the printing  of moulds or casting moulds and casting.  Jack explained that he mostly uses 3D printing for lost  wax casting but also some sintering. But he went on to  say that 3D sintering is not currently that realistic for him  at  the  moment,  mainly  due  to  the  poor  surface  finish.  Generally most of his work is made in a direct castable,  DLP printed resin which gets burnt out or ‘lost’ during the  lost  wax  casting  process.  He  says  that’s  generally  the  best way of doing things as you get less aggregation of  the piece and it’s a more direct replication of the digital  design.  Jack  owns  a  Reify  Technology  Solus  DLP  3D  printer, with a very small printing bed of only 80 x 45 mm  but a very high X, Y and Z resolution.   About software, Jack says:   —  I use Rhino™ and Gemvison Matrix. I naturally  gravitate towards surface modelling; it suits  the way I think. I’ve also used Artcam™ – by  Autodesk – but I don’t really get on with it all  too well. It’s superb for relief sculpting, but  as my work is more architectural in nature, it  is pretty limiting, not being truly 3D. Rhino’s  what I studied at university and it’s what I  used in my first job after graduating, as a 3D  printing technician and CAD designer. Also,  it’s relatively affordable and adaptable. I will  usually send an STL file to my printer but if I  need to print a piece larger than my machine’s  bed, I use Shapeways™ in Netherlands New  York. Their turnaround time is considerably  slower than printing myself, 10 days vs 2-6  hours, but the quality is reasonable and at a  good price.   8  Jack Row, bench tools   —  It’s all to do with new tools and developments  in technology. I imagine when the first super  accurate lathes were commercially available,  some craftspeople using traditional tooling would  have been up in arms, but now a craftsperson  who uses a modern lathe is still a craftsperson.  It’s clearly all relative to the period in history.  Whenever I do get into discussions about this  ‘cheating’ argument, I generally find it is with  poor craftspeople. The goldsmith I studied under,  during my apprenticeship, always said that the  method you use is irrelevant; getting the best  end result is all that matters. The process by  which you got there is irrelevant, especially to  the consumer. And again, the same people who  argue it’s not made in the correct way, or it’s not  how it should have been done and is cheating  etc. – I’ll always ask them if they have electric  lighting in their workshop. Are they an historical  re-enactor? Working by candle light? Where do  you draw the line? I’ve always believed that a  bad craftsperson mocks the skills he or she does  not possess.   I then asked Jack if his work was solely created by 3D  printing, to which he replied:  It depends on the design  e.g., some things might  be 3D printed and then cast, you lose the print  in the process , you could argue that maybe 20  to 25 per cent of that job is achieved through 3D    —  66  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   66  9 26 17   3:47 PM   I then asked Jack about the barriers to 3D printing:   —  The barriers for me are the varied processes  which are vital post print. I can design and print  virtually anything, but it doesn’t necessarily  mean it is suitable for the processes essential  in creating a finished piece to a professional  standard. These are primarily lost wax casting,  finishing and gem-setting. As sintering gets  better, we will be able to neatly side-step some  of the limitations of the lost wax casting process  and the many variables which accompany it.  However we are always limited by the tolerances  and properties of the materials we use. If I need  to place a gemstone into a design, I need to  make sure it’s the right thickness and form to  allow it to be securely set – you also have to  understand the very specialised setting process.  3D printing can still be quite expensive to use,  and it is often cheaper to make something in the  traditional way. For example, I have a range of  pens with a very fine  0.3-mm thick  twisted wire,  wrapped around cylindrical form, that creates  a beautiful undulating pattern. I could replicate  this in CAD, 3D print and cast, but the result of  making by hand is vastly superior in quality and  finish, not to mention more economical.   In  response  to  my  question  regarding  craft  skills,  Jack  responded:   —  Far from giving up craft skills, I have actually  developed new ones and continue to hone  my existing ones. It’s made me join the dots,   Jack Row, SLA build platform  so to speak. Definitely 3D printing has craft  sensibilities. There are CAD designers and  then there are CAD designers; some are more  talented and experienced than others. It’s the  same with goldsmithing, and any other craft, they  all take a long time to learn and master – hence  the old adage that 10,000 hours are needed to  merely become proficient. CAD and 3D printing  is a long way from merely pressing a button.  It should just be regarded as another tool. It  is certainly a significant and versatile tool, but  still fundamentally a tool. All that matters is the  excellence of the work that you create.   9  Jack Row, Jaali fountain pen.

Marianne  and  I  met  in  person and handled many of her pieces, which perhaps  explains the more hands-on nature of our discussion. She  explains the inspiration for her work:   —  I have a fascination with scale, surface, form  and function. I explore ideas about the nature  of time and its transience and permanence. I try  to re-deﬁne the traditional watch and the way it  is worn by expanding its potential for hanging  and draping on different parts of the body and  clothing.  Marianne  calls  herself  a  maker  or  ‘designer  maker’,  and this fits her practice in the true sense of the words.  Marianne articulates a problem common to many cross- disciplinary practitioners:   —  I tend to look at the person I’m talking to and  pigeonhole myself for them – otherwise people  just look at you blankly – so I usually just say  I’m a silversmith or jeweller. The craft design   associations have the same problem, because  I make jewellery, watches and architectural  pieces, so basically, I’m not a member of any of  the associations.  Her  introduction  to  3D  printing  technologies  began  around 2007, when direct metal laser sintering became  available and Marianne started learning Rhino. She had  played  with  the  technology  earlier,  but  clearly  states  there  was  no  incentive  for  her  to  use  it  until  suitable  materials were accessible. She learnt the technology by  actually making a piece of work and working through the  tutorials.  Here we discussed the Rhino Toy Duck tutorial,  which almost everybody seems to have made in order to  understand Boolean difference!   When asked what proportion of her work was made with  3D printing, Marianne said that she makes a number of  3D-printed items but has actually only made a few different  designs. She explained that this is because she is too busy  with other things. But this is modesty on her part. Later  on  in  our  discussions,  she  stated  that  she  was  able  to  create seventy watch cases for her miniature watch ‘Sho’  in one build. It is difficult to discuss with her if her works  are solely 3D printed, as obviously the watch movements   10  Marianne Forrest, Tiny titanium drop group.  11  Marianne Forrest, 'Paleolith' DMLS stainless steel.

However, in terms of the qualities that 3D print has to  offer, Marianne is very clear, when describing her most  complicated work to date, the unique watch ‘Paleolith’.  She explained the complexities of the build process:   —  Paleolith was actually built in six parts, then  welded together. Because it’s a very different  process  to making a piece by hand , especially  with the support structure and the cleaning up  required, this piece took me six months to clean  up! However, one of the interesting things about  it is I couldn’t have physically made it like this by  hand. Each one is made using a cone that I had  stacked together and then cut. There is no way  I would ever have made that by hand; it would  have taken me a couple of years. So six months  is really quite quick!   —  It is possible to see from the comb structure that it would  have been impossible to get tools into the tight spaces in  order to cut them; similarly, casting would not have worked  as the moulds would have been far too complicated. As  a counterpoint to the length of time and work required by  ‘Paleolith’, Marianne created a series ‘Sho’, in which she   designed the object’s parameters so it would require no  cleaning up. She made sure that she specified the angles  to avoid overhanging features of greater than 30 degrees,  thus creating a deliberately self-supporting work that only  had a tiny little spigot in the middle to connect it to the  base of the build structure in the bed: ‘When I got it back  from  printing  I  actually  didn’t  do  any  cleaning  up  –  just  gave it a quick polish and there you go’.  She has created various versions of this watch, as well  as  a  ring  watch,  made  from  the  same  3D-printed  file.  While discussing this simpler series of work, I asked her  whether  she  made  the  watch  movements  herself  or  if  she  bought  them  in.  Marianne  replied  that  she  did  not  make them herself, but she did make adjustments and  alterations to the larger movements:  I buy them in. So my smallest watch   is absolutely governed by the smallest  manufactured movement. When it comes to the  watch cases, with the absolute smallest one I  had to make it in Rhino software because you  can’t physically make it that small, which was  interesting and a really good use of Rhino, as it  was absolutely pared down – they also sell like  hotcakes!  Marianne explained in greater detail how 3D printing is  crucial  to  the  whole  process  of  getting  the  movements  to  fit:  ‘I  took  each  wall  thickness  right  down  to  the   9781474248679_txt_app.indb   69  69  9 26 17   3:47 PM   13  Marianne Forrest, Silver Sliver.    Marianne Forrest 2016.  last  possible  parameter  –  you  can  only  do  that  in  3D  prototyping; you just can’t cast it. It will shrink or move  or lose something and then the movement doesn’t fit; [it  is] very logical. So I like the intensity of that tininess but  I also like the wear-ability.’   —  In complete contrast to the minute nature of her watches,  Marianne then deliberately took on a larger-scale project  with funding from London Metropolitan University in which  she  could  work  much  faster:  ‘I  did  a  whole  research  project  –  the  “transformation”  series  –  things  made  instantly  or  spontaneously,  that  was  about  speed  of  making as well as size’.  Marianne  also  makes  things  on  a  much  grander  scale,  grander  even  than  the  ‘Transformations’  series.  Her  method  of  describing  the  various  areas  of  her  working  practice is therefore very ordered. She accords separate  groupings to her works dependent on scale: ‘But then I  go up again into the architectural stuff, which is always  site specific and intended to be with the community. But I  enjoy all that because it’s different every time’.  In relation to 3D printing and digital technology, the way  she now approaches her practice is very different because  she uses Rhino to make models of the big things, which  she  finds  much  easier  for  visualisation  purposes.  She  feels  this  is  an  interesting  addition  to  what  she  has  offered to clients before. When I asked Marianne about   the barriers that prevent her from using 3D printing, her  response was interesting:  I try to cut things like I would at the bench. I’m  struggling with it at the moment. Having done the  earlier pieces, I’m back to the cutting and filing  inside the computer. So I started with a box and  almost everything was Boolean difference, but  I’m trying to make it all subtractive manufacture.  That paradox is quite interesting to me, and the  paradox between the hand and the screen, as  most people don’t think of it that way  i.e., as an  approach to the technology .  This seems to me a very interesting way of working. 3D  printing is in itself an additive process and the software  therefore allows you to build the object in a similar additive  manner.  This  makes  working  deliberately  subtractively  in an additive process seem unusual. I wonder if this is  something  that  is  only  inherent  to  a  person  with  many  years  of  hand-craft  practice  who  has  then  learnt  digital  technologies as opposed to a person who has grown up  with both.  Marianne also comments:   —  Rather than trying to stretch the technology,  I’m just trying to make things in different ways.  What interests me is the way you use your hands   70  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   70  9 26 17   3:47 PM   and brain to make something. Most of the time  that interface between hand and brain is lost  because all you are doing is clicking. But when I  am building something in the computer, it’s very  much using the same parts of my brain. I get  really close to the screen and I am right there  and in there with it.   —  When  asked  where  she  saw  the  future  of  3D  print  for  artists,  designers  and  craftspeople,  her  reply  was  very  specific about her work as a jeweller and she commented  on the tiny ‘Sho’ watch cases:  Marianne showed me a cast watch she made by printing  a  plastic  prototype  for  a  mould  on  the  envisionTeC™.  Marianne  thought  it  had  ended  up  slightly  different  to  the way she had envisioned it – certainly it was weaker,  and  in  addition,  if  she  had  made  a  watch  by  using  the  plastic  as  a  mould,  the  casting  would  have  shrunk  the  piece again  maybe 6% less in terms of shrinkage , which  on a watch is impossible – you would have to re-cut every  single one to make the movement fit.  Marianne reflected:   —  It’s a nice piece but it’s got problems. I made  another one which was also resin and, instead  of trying to cast it, I thought, well how else  could you make this a ‘real thing’ in real metal,  because metal is really the key for me – although  I work in all materials for this process, I want  to work in metal, so I made another one and  then electroformed it afterwards. I thought the  combination of electroforming and resin would  keep it all together but it didn’t quite – that one  broke – but what an interesting way to do it!  This example led Marianne and I to a discussion of the  structural integrity of electroforming on a 3D-printed core.  Marianne  said  the  model  that  she  had  shown  me  was  plated  very  fast  to  give  it  a  deliberately  rough  surface,  and  I  speculated  that  the  result  would  therefore  be  weaker than a piece that had been plated more slowly.  But  Marianne’s  primary  interest  was  the  surface  and  the  texture  that  produced  a  piece  that  looked  more  aesthetically pleasing and less digitally created. Structural  concerns were secondary and were only important when  the piece broke. In fact, Marianne used the electroplated  pieces  as  bracelets  because  she  felt  they  were  never  quite resolved as watches.  I have a variety of different pieces [that] I can  use to make watches, around seventy-odd – so  really it’s a manufacturing system. I mean it’s  only seventy that I got out of it, but seventy  watches is fantastic for me. I have piles of them  back at the studio made that I haven’t had  time to finish. So after I made this one, I was  really interested. Going back to the making, this  process, which is seen as a prototyping process –  and I hate to say this! – could actually be the way  that Britain could resolve some of its financial  issues, in manufacturing terms.  Marianne  is  perhaps  slightly  different  to  the  other  two  case  studies  presented  in  this  chapter  in  that  she  waited  until  the  material  properties  were  closer  to  her  requirements  as  a  craftsperson  before  adopting  the  technology. This means that she is specifically using the  material  properties  of  the  metal  in  order  to  obtain  the  results she is seeking. However, it is clear that Marianne  has had to adopt different working practices and develop  strategies  that  take  on  board  the  particular  material  qualities of 3D-printed titanium.  14  Marianne Forrest, Watch detail.

Michael eden.  16  Michael eden, ‘Wedgwoodn’t Tureen, Pink’.   Michael eden.   —  After spending twenty years as a successful studio potter,  in 2006 Michael eden undertook an MPhil at the Royal  College of Art in order to learn about digital technologies  and  3D  printing.  His  MPhil  explored  how  an  interest  in  digital design and manufacturing could be developed and  combined  with  the  craft  skills  he  had  already  acquired.  His work is inspired by historic objects and contemporary  themes  –  at  the  same  time  exploring  the  relationships  between  the  hand-crafted  and  digital  tools.  He  also  investigates experimental manufacturing technology and  materials. This new way of working has allowed Michael  eden  to  extend  his  practice  into  other  areas,  such  as  glass and furniture. The first 3D-printed work that Michael  made  was  the  work  entitled  ‘Wedgwoodn’t  Tureen’  in  2007.  Michael  outlines  his  creative  process  and  approach  to  the work in his article ‘Things Machines Have Made’:7  Redesigning an iconic object from the first  Industrial Revolution, I produced it in a way  that would have been impossible using  conventional industrial ceramic techniques.  The piece is loosely based on early Wedgwood  tureens, chosen for their classic beauty and in  homage to Josiah Wedgwood’s role as a father  of the first Industrial Revolution. The delicate,  pierced surface is inspired by bone, referring  to the natural objects used by Wedgwood  and his contemporaries as the inspiration for  many of their designs. My choice also refers  to the artificial bone produced by AM. The  technology removes the constraints of ‘design  for manufacture’ where the processing of  materials has an impact on the final outcome.  In other words, there are only certain forms that  one can throw on a wheel; gravity, centrifugal   72  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   72  9 26 17   3:47 PM   force and the material qualities of clay limit  the possibilities. The ‘Wedgwoodn’t Tureen’  demonstrates the removal of these constraints  and the potential to create previously impossible  forms that can creatively communicate new  ideas.  The  tureen  was  designed  on  Rhino  3D™  and  FreeForm  software. The files were then sent to a Z Corp 3D printing  machine  that  ‘printed’  the  piece.  It  was  then  coated  in  a  non-fired  ceramic  material  that  simulates  a  ceramic  surface,  which  was  developed  by  the  French  company  Axiatec   no  longer  in  business   and  which  Michael  adapted to closely resemble Wedgwood ‘Black Basalt.’8  Unlike  many  of  the  artists  and  designers  that  I  interviewed,  Michael  acknowledges  his  experience  of  using  3D  printers  –  and  Z  Corp  machines  in  particular  –  is  almost  zero.  Therefore  Michael  has  collaborated  with  others  for  the  production  of  much  of  his  work.  In  a collaboration with Mark Ganter  Soldner Laboratory at  the  University  of  Washington,  Seattle ,9  he  produced  a  number of 3D-printed ceramic pieces. Michael sent the  works  to  Mark  Ganter  in  a  biscuit-fired  state,  which  he  then glazed and fired in his own studio to complete them:  ‘In my experiments with Mark Ganter – the pieces he sent   over to me – I had to coat them in a vitreous slip first, fire  them and then glaze them. That worked perfectly.’  When  asked  about  how  he  defines  himself  and  his  practice, Michael describes being in a grey area between  design, art and craft, which to him is interesting territory,  partly  because  of  the  baggage  of  language.  Michael  wishes to circumvent the traditional boundaries and to be  able to select and choose modes and methods of working  from  whichever  discipline  he  chooses,  and  in  doing  so  hopefully create some sort of dialogue or starting point  for  conversations  around  language  and  territories.  This  led us into a discussion around what I call ‘the craft of  the digital’ – whereby without tacit knowledge of materials  and a fundamental understanding of process you actually  can’t  make  things  well  in  3D.  The  current  problem  is  that  the  technology  is  very  removed  from  hands-on  manufacture,  which  in  itself  creates  tacit  knowledge.  Michael  agreed  with  this  view  and  provided  some  examples from the influential design commentator Geoff  Hollington10 and craftsman Fred Baier. He comments:   —  Exactly, this is 1800 in terms of the first  industrial revolution, to paraphrase Geoff  Hollington. So it’s still very early days, we don’t  have those intuitive interfaces and responsive or   17  Michael eden, ‘Amalthea’.

In this case 3D printing  offers  him  no  advantages:  ‘I  want  people  to  look  at  my  stuff and be more interested in the stories, the “why” not  the “how”. But having said that, if you look at handmade  studio ceramics you are engaged as a user, viewer, buyer,  with materials and process. You can’t escape the process.’  In order to qualify Michael’s position further in relation to  3D printing and traditional craft skills, it seemed relevant  to question what proportion of Michael’s work was now  3D printed. He responded:   —  Yes. 100%. I haven’t made any conventional  ceramic pieces for some time actually. But if I  need to make a cup and saucer or some plant  pots, I will have no hesitation to make them on  the wheel. It’s all about the appropriate use of  tools. 3D printing allows me make artworks that I  cannot make any other way. As I say, throwing is  throwing and 3D printing is 3D printing.  Next, I asked Michael what he does with his files. He uses  a commercial bureau called 3TRPD to make all his work.  The relationship that he has developed over the years is  fundamental  to  success:  ‘They  are  the  craftsmen   and  women  of their tools and technology and I rely on their  knowledge in order to produce high quality prints. There  is a bouncing back and forth of files, until any technical  issues are ironed out. They have Magics™ software that  is more efficient at joining parts than the software that I  use.’  I haven’t made any conventional ceramic pieces  for some time actually. [. . .] Having said that, I’ve  just been on the wheel this morning teaching a  throwing class. But as I say, throwing is throwing  and 3D is 3D. At the moment I take [my pieces]  to a commercial company called 3T RPD™,  but mostly they’ve been made at the Bartlett’s  Digital Manufacturing Centre. I am talking to a  French company, as well [. . .], the bureau service  called ‘Sculpteo’11 who have an interesting app  on their website. I thought the technology that’s  behind that is quite amazing and just shows the  potential of all this technology. That’s what I like  about it, that it’s not resolved totally but it does  have extraordinary number-crunching capacity.  19  Michael eden, ‘Babel Vessel’, 2012.   Michael eden.  more tactile devices to engage with – although  Fred Baier’s comments were written a few years  ago now, so things have changed. The furniture  maker Fred Baier is cautious about the use  of computers by makers. He opines, ‘Unless  artists can . . . push and pervert their software  far beyond its expected parameters, they must  accept having their role as author composer  downgraded to performer’.  In  complete  contrast  to  Baier,  Michael’s  belief  is  that  the most immediate benefit of 3D printing is the creative  freedom it offers over traditional craft production methods:   —  I think the reason is that Fred Baier’s comments  link to the media of attraction, of being seduced  by whizzy new tools. You have to choose the  tools and materials and processes appropriately  in order to communicate ideas or to solve a  problem. You have to really embrace and get  under the skin of what you are trying to achieve,  and then go to your enhanced toolbox and  choose the right way. If I want to make some  espresso cups and saucers at the moment, I will  probably go back to the wheel and throw them.   —  74  Michael expands his argument with an example: Given the  current technological developments of 3D printing and his  skill as a craftsman, if he needs to make a set of cups   In  terms  of  the  software  the  he  uses,  Michael  has  the  T-Splines  plug-in  but  tends  to  use  the  Apple  Macintosh   9781474248679_txt_app.indb   74  9 26 17   3:48 PM   beta version of Rhino. He has recently discovered a new  plug-in for Rhino, which, in his opinion, has a more organic  modelling system and interesting look. He also currently  uses Bootcamp™ when he needs access to a Windows  environment  but  has  recently  investigated  Parallels™  so he can just return to the Windows version of Rhino,  which  will  run  the  new  plug-ins.  Michael  needs  to  use  proprietary software such as Rhino because the majority  of his work is printed by 3D bureau services such as 3T  RPD or iMaterialise™, and these bureaus need to be able  to read the files easily. ‘occasionally they have to crunch  some  parts.  The  main  problem  with  Rhino  can  be  the  Boolean extraction function so sometimes I have to send  an  object  in  two  or  three  pieces  within  a  file,  and  then  the bureau repair it to make it watertight in Geomagic™.’  Michael commented on the barriers to the wider adoption  of 3D printing:   —  Cost, learning software, it takes a while; it’s a  craft skill. Therefore it involves a lot of trial and  a lot of error. Other limitations are the variety of  materials available  but that is moving apace . If  I am talking to students, they are put off by the  cost and having to learn the software. Those are  the two main considerations.  Michael  believes  these  barriers  will  be  overcome,  because  the  software  will  become  more  intuitive.  He  also  argues  that  3D  design  students  should  be  getting   their heads around modelling systems. He qualifies this  further:  ‘It’s  interesting  seeing  some  students  going  through a transition period between 2 and 3D where they  suddenly seem to understand how to convert 2D ideas  into three-dimensional resolved objects’.  He  believes  craft  skills  are  integral  to  3D  printing,  commenting that he had found the process surprisingly  seamless, but you do have to be determined:   —  I think it has its own craft sensibilities and this  overlaps between the traditional craft skills and  the tacit knowledge that I have built up over  the years, but I am having to adapt those skills  and that knowledge and add to them. I feel as  though I have been going through a transition  and evolutionary process. I think I was of a  disposition when I set out to want to learn and  I think I have a fairly dogged nature to resolve  issues, particularly in Rhino – ‘it must be capable  of doing this’ – and I will work my way around  problems. I guess some of the time I am using  some fairly non-conventional ways to do things. I  don’t know if I am doing it correctly.  When  considering  the  future  of  3D  printing,  Michael  predicts the sector is going to become more accessible  with  a  wider  range  of  materials.  The  technology  will  become  commonplace  and  domestic  over  time.  It  will  affect the distribution systems, have an enormous impact   20  Michael eden, ‘Mnemosyne’, 2012.

Michael  illustrates  his  prediction  with  the  example  of  the  Aerospace  company  eADS  in  producing  door hinges for the Airbus with a weight reduction of ten  kilograms  that  could  save  US$1,000  of  fuel  a  year.12  Furthermore,  he  argues  3D  printing  is  going  to  change  large areas of life in quite unforeseen ways:   —  In terms of democratising design – allowing the  individual to design well – just because you have  Photoshop doesn’t mean you should use it. You  are not a graphic designer if you have Photoshop  on your computer; you still need to learn to be  a designer, so in terms of democratising design,  I don’t think it will at all. Just look at stuff on  Shapeways™; it’s grim, most of it! But that is  fine, I’ve absolutely no issue whatsoever, it’s  great that people are engaging and throwing out  this stuff.  Michael concluded our discussion with a positive view of  the future of 3D printing before qualifying this optimism  with  an  almost  apocalyptic  view  of  what  the  long-term  future of the 3D printer may hold:  If the 3D printer comes into the home, and if  you can print smaller domestic items in a range  of materials, or more complex manufacturing  systems so that printer circuits can be integrated  into the body of an object so you don’t need to  add that at a later stage – that’s all going to  come. Also, the other area that I think is quite  worrying, really, is the potential to print living  biological material. We hear about being able to  produce new livers and kidneys and suchlike. As  information becomes digitised and available as  code, then there is the potential to rewrite the  A,G,T and C of cell structures. So the potential,  if you have a digital version of the genome, has  major ethical and moral issues that we aren’t  really engaging with.  Michael  eden  entered  the  field  of  3D  printing  much  earlier  than  Jack  Row  and  Marianne  Forrest  but,  unlike  the others, he had to deal with materials that were not  part  of  his  personal  practice.  It  is  clear  that  Michael’s  early  works  were  created  with  an  interesting  synergy  of  two  processes.  The  ‘Wedgwouldn’t  Tureen’  was  an  excellent example of a skeuomorph, which tends to occur    —  76  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   76  9 26 17   3:48 PM   from  processes  in  transition.  The  ceramic  vessel  was  not ceramic but used a material that closely resembled  a  glazed  ceramic  artefact.  eden  created  a  vessel  that  to  all  intents  and  purposes  resembled  a  traditionally  manufactured eighteenth-century pot but in reality has a   3D-printed plaster-based core, which was then infiltrated  with a ceramic loaded resin. I feel this work confronts the  current problems of 3D printing and presents them as a  dialogue, where the pot is actually decorative rather than  a functional ceramic object.  There  is  no  doubt  that  both  Marianne  Forrest  and  Jack  Row  have  deliberately  tackled  the  material  properties  and issues that arise from material properties more than  any other of the practitioners I have interviewed for this  book. In deliberately waiting for the technology to mature,   Marianne could produce the result she was seeking. Jack  makes his jewelled pens in a similar way, 3D modelling  in  CAD  and  then  hand  finishing  after  the  3D  printing  process – none of which are part of the standard toolkit  the manufacturer of the 3D printer intended.  1  oriel Myrddin Gallery  2012 ,  ‘Labcraft: Digital Adventures in  Contemporary Craft.

Practitioners create new ideas and  imagery that is deliberately different from their peers.  Therefore,  any  coherence  within  the  discipline  is  probably  going  to  be  due  to  the  restrictions  of  the  process  rather  than  any  deliberate  intention  from  the  artists.  It  is  possible  to  argue  that  fine  artists  have  engaged  with  the  medium  of  3D  printing  as  a  commercially  available  process  almost  since  its  inception. By commercial processes, I mean beyond  those situated solely within research departments. As  demonstrated in Chapter 1, sculptors were creating  3D-printed  works  almost  at  the  same  time  as  the  first commercial machines entered the market.  The  first documented example I can find is the work of  Masaki Fujihata in 1989,1 which is within three years  of the first commercial machine, Charles Hull’s SLA1  from 3D Systems.2   However,  there  is  always  a  distinction  between  the earliest adopters of a process and a point when  it  gains  more  mainstream  acceptance.  This  begins  within the development cycle, when a new printing or  manufacturing process is introduced and it begins to  be adopted by artists as a creative process. one of   the indicators that a technology is gaining credence  and creates artwork of standing is that artists begin to  use technology as a means to an end, rather than as a  demonstration of what the process itself can achieve. In the first edition of this book, I tried to highlight  how adoption was beginning to take place, using a  number  of  examples  from  the  first  decade  of  this  century. I have kept these examples in order to give  an understanding of how art practice develops along  with a new technology. However, the second part of  this chapter, which includes the case studies, looks  at a new generation of younger artists. I have stated  before that early adopters tend to create artefacts,  which, at best, look as though they are using a very  specific technology. The most innovative work occurs  when  the  images  created  use  the  technology  as  a  means  to  an  end.  one  of  the  earliest  works  that  could be said to demonstrate this concept is ‘People  1:10’, made between 1998 and 2001 by the German  artist  Karin  Sander.  Sander  explains  her  creative  process on her website.3  78  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   78  9 26 17   3:48 PM   1  Karin Sander, ‘Gerd Hatje 1:10’, 1998  left , 3D bodyscan of the living person, FDM  fused deposition modeling , ABS  Acrylnitril-Butadien-Styrol ,  Airbrush, Scale 1:10; height: ca. 18 cm, Courtesy: Sammlung Landesbank Baden-Württemberg, Stuttgart.

Photo:  Karin Sander.   Karin Sander  2012.  People  are  laser-scanned  using  a  body  scanner  that  employs a 3D photographic process originally developed  for the fashion industry. Their data is then sent to an  extruder,  which  recreates  their  body  shape  slice-by- slice  in  plastic.  It  is  a  lengthy  process,  but  it  results  in  an  exact  reproduction  of  the  person  in  question  –  a  three-dimensional  self-portrait  in  a  pose  chosen  by   the subject at one-tenth scale. The figure is produced  entirely by mechanical means, and the replica stands  in the middle of the exhibition as if transposed directly  from the real world.  The models were scanned with a laser scanner,  then  printed  by  fused  deposition  modelling   FDM    80  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   80  9 26 17   3:48 PM   using  an  Acryl-Butadiene-Nitryl-Styrol   ABS   plastic.  once  printed,  the  models  were  airbrushed  and  finished  to  match  their  scans.  The  real  proof  of  my  argument  is  that  Sander  was  interested  only  in  the  final  result  and  the  means  to  get  there.  In  no  circumstances  are  the  models  a  demonstration  of  the  process;  they  have  been  sprayed  and  finished  after printing, so it is not possible to know how they  were made unless you are told.  If one looks at the work of other artists who also  used 3D printing in the early part of this century, this  aspect  of  inherent  ‘3D  printedness’  can  be  more  difficult to quantify – for example, Rachel Whiteread’s  ‘Secondhand’,  made  in  2004.  Here  Whiteread  had  scans made of a set of vintage dollhouse furniture,  outputted at the same scale in laser sintered white  nylon.  Whiteread has an history of making monochromatic  works  that  reveal  the  sculptural  form  of  an  object,   but  it  is  difficult  to  move  away  from  the  fact  that  these have a look of laser sintered 3D-printed nylon   this  has  a  white  appearance  with  a  slightly  ribbed  texture . one is left to ponder: Is Whiteread just using  the  process  to  her  own  ends  or  is  that  sentiment  overridden by the inherent qualities produced by this  particular aspect of the 3D printing process?  This  highlights  one  of  the  problems  that  occur  when articulating how fine artists interface with the  medium.  In  fact,  many  artists  do  not  themselves  interface  with  the  medium  at  all  and  rely  upon  the  skills  of  specialists  for  the  production  of  a  one-off  commission. This is not a criticism of such artists but  merely a difficulty to note in defining those that use  the  technology  in  a  book  such  as  this.  Conversely,  those artists who collaborate with others to use the  technology – precisely in those one-off commissions  – are often the very people who push the technology  to new limits.  3  3, 4  ‘Secondhand’, Rachel Whiteread  2004 .

The  best exemplar of the work CFPR have undertaken is, in  my view, the ‘Medal of Dishonour’ for the late Richard  Hamilton.4  In  2006  Richard  was  commissioned  by  the British Arts Medals Trust to make a medal for the  British Museum as part of the exhibition ‘Medals of  Dishonour’, shown at the museum in 2009.  Richard  came  to  the  CFPR  because  he  wanted  to transcribe photographs of Tony Blair in relief onto  one side of the medal and Alastair Campbell on the  other. In his discussions with the foundry, he found  that  they  had  no  means  of  digitally  transferring  a  photograph into a relief surface, apart from sculpting  the medal by hand.  The foundry may have not been  aware,  but  creating  a  relief  surface  from  greyscale  image  is  a  widely  known  and  standard  technique.   Richard  wanted  to  see  if  we  could  3D  print  the  master matrices for casting. The very nature of this  process harks back to the photo-relief imaging of the  Woodburytype process. over the course of two years,  we tried every 3D printing process we could obtain   access  to,  including  wax  printing,  envisionTeC™,  Z  Corp®,  objet®,  Stratasys®  and  eoS®.  Whilst  all  of  these had some advantages, none gave the particular  quality  of  finish  that  Richard  was  striving  for;  the  technology  at  that  point  was  simply  not  capable  of  producing  the  desired  result.  However,  what  the  visual  appearance  of  the  3D-printed  versions  did  achieve  was  to  help  both  Richard  and  the  CFPR  team to resolve what the final piece should look like.  Finally, the piece was CNC milled in model board and  the moulds were made from these milled matrices.  This does mean that, in reality, the piece was not 3D  printed, but, as I have already said, it is the path that  one takes and the intention one has to create a good  piece of art that is important!  one of the difficulties within the fine arts is the  dichotomy  between  concept  and  process.  In  the  early  part  of  the  twenty-first  century,  most  artists  are more concerned with concept, and the means of  production has become almost secondary, which can  make it difficult to find artists who are consistently  using particular technology.  5  Richard Hamilton, ‘The Hutton Award’  Tony  Blair , from the series ‘Art, Technology and a Medal  Designed for Dishonour’, 2008.

Rick Becker.  10  one  example  of  an  artist  who  will  use  the  technology whenever it is expedient is the American  figurative sculptor Rick Becker. A recent commission  was  the  ‘Homer  Simpson  Memorial  Bust’  made  for  the Fox Broadcasting Company to celebrate the 500th  episode of The Simpsons. I also suspect that Rick is  just one of many artists who use the technology in this  way, almost without being aware that they are using  3D  printing  processes.  In  early  2006  Rick  supplied  the Centre for Fine Print Research with a set of scans  that had been made by his foundry in New Mexico.  The  scans  were  of  a  maquette  for  a  large  bronze  sculpture, commissioned by Vietnam War veterans in   San Diego, including a group of men who had been  PoWs, as a memorial to their fallen comrades.  The  intention  was  to  scale  the  maquette  to  a  fourteen-foot-high  sculpture.  Initially  Rick  came  to  us  with  the  scans  to  produce  a  twelve-inch  plaster  3D-printed Z Corp model to show the veterans what  the maquette would look like. The unexpected bonus  for Rick was that, because the model was made in  plaster,  he  could  rework  the  maquette  beyond  his  original model in order to further achieve what he had  intended with his first models.  Rick  had  started  his  sculpture  in  the  traditional  manner with pencil sketches, then moved to a more   84  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   84  9 26 17   3:48 PM   detailed  clay  maquette  that  was  about  eighteen  inches  in  height,  which  made  it  small  enough  to  quickly  sculpt  and  modify.  Rick  worked  small  to  finalise  the  important  aspects  of  the  composition,  which  would  be  much  harder  to  change  at  full  scale.  once  they  saw  the  maquette,  the  veterans  asked  if  Rick  could  make  them  a  small  replica  of  the  monument  for  their  fundraising.  He  was  able  to  scan  and  print  the  maquette  at  a  small  twelve- inch size for plastic casting, since the clay maquette  had  been  3D  scanned  anyway  for  the  armature  enlargement.  The  clay  was  scanned  at  Cyber  FX  in  Burbank near Hollywood in California. Cyber FX does  lots of work for the TV and film industry, scanning live  actors for wardrobe, special FX as well as sculpture  enlargements  and  so  on.  Rick  explains,  ‘When  I  received the 3D prints from [the CFPR] I saw some  items I wanted to modify for both artistic reasons and  for moldability. one of the materials carved much like  plaster, nice and smooth. I made the modifications  on  this  print.  I  also  added  hard  plasticine  clay  in  areas I wanted to build up.’  Tom  Banwell  at  Cyber  FX  in  Northern  California  made  the  plastic  figures  via  silicone  moulds.  Rick  says, ‘Tom created a faux bronze patina – copperish  colour with a rubbed blackish wash. They were a bit  dark but the blackish wash stuck in the STL-induced  recesses, making it hard to burnish back to a lighter  colour. In hindsight, I would have sealed or smoothed  these better prior to melding.’  Commenting on the results from the final finished   piece, Rick says:  The  American  ex-POWs  added  the  little  statues  to  their  website   http:  www.sdpow.org  ,  offering  them  for donations of above $50, I think, and gold versions  for  bigger  donations.  They  sold  several  hundred,  I  believe. These little statues were instrumental in their  very  successful  fundraising  and  political  support  networking, enabling them to fund the major fourteen- foot statue that now stands in San Diego.5  Mark  Wallinger’s  ‘White  Horse’  provides  a  further example of 3D laser scanning which is then  transcribed to a small model. The model functions  both  as  a  maquette  for  a  larger  piece  and  as  a  sculpture  that  can  be  editioned  in  its  own  right.   To quote from his gallery press release:6 ‘In 2009  Mark  Wallinger  was  awarded  the  commission  for  a  monumental  sculpture  for  the  ebbsfleet  Valley  development  in  Kent.  His  winning  project  was  for  the  erection  of  a  white  horse,  50  meters  high,  realistic  in  all  detail  –  a  thoroughbred  stallion  of  immense  proportions,  standing  in  a  field  in  the  countryside.’  The  sculpture  has  yet  to  be  built  as  the  costs  have risen from £1 million to £15 million. The small- scale  work  made  using  the  scans  for  the  large  sculpture  was  undertaken  by  Chris  Cornish,  who  runs the scanning service Sample and Hold.7 Sample  and Hold were asked to 3D scan the thoroughbred  racehorse  ‘Riviera  Red’.  This  posed  a  number  of  unique  challenges  relating  to  the  local  and  overall  movement  of  the  subject  –  made  all  the  more  critical by the requirement to capture the horse in a  specific pose. Two different capture techniques were  employed: an infrared handheld scanner and a white  light  photogrammetry  method  to  instantaneously  capture a 3D cage of reference points and to anchor  the  more  detailed  scan  data.  once  the  scan  had  been adjusted to make it watertight, the mane and  tail were then drawn and added to the scans. Next,  a solid 3D print was produced using an objet printer  from which the final mould was made. The sculptures  are 1:10 scale of the real horse and approximately  1:250 scale of the final landmark.  It is clear that a large number of successful fine  artists are used to having their work made for them.  So  the  ability  to  3D  print  and  scan  armatures  and  small-scale  models  and  to  have  them  scaled  up  to  large  sizes  is  something  of  value  to  artists  and  sculptors  –  in  particular,  those  who  produce  large- scale  works  for  public  commissions.  In  the  21st  century we have moved away from the  still commonly  held  view that the fine artist works in isolation in the  studio. I am aware this is a gross generalisation – in  the case of sculptors, this has almost always been  the case; it is not possible to make a very large-scale  work  in  isolation,  and  few  sculptors  can  afford  the  luxury of their own foundry or forge. Additionally, the  underlying armature or structure of a sculpture has  nearly  always  been  created  by  an  assistant  and  it  was only the final surface that was finished by the  master.  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   85  85  9 26 17   3:48 PM   and,  as  costs  and  acceptance  have  become  more  universal,  that  new  generation  has  been  easier  to  identify.  In writing the second edition of this book, I realised  that in the last three years there has been a growing  body of what might be called ‘3D tech savvy’ artists.  These artists not only make art for themselves, but,  in the case of Sophie Kahn and Sebastian Burdon,  also earn part of their living making work for others.  Mat  Collishaw  falls  into  the  artist  category.  Within  his studio model, the conceptual and visual aspects  are  very  tightly  controlled  by  Mat,  but  the  physical  manufacture is carried out by others, either by sub- contracting work or employing people in his studio.  Jonathan  Monaghan  makes  work  across  a  range  of  digital  disciplines,  a  feature  that  is  common  to  all  the  fine  art  case  studies.  All  of  these  artists,  and  many  of  the  other  artists  and  designers  I  interviewed, are highly skilled digital craftsmen and  women. When I first interviewed people in 2012–13,  most  were  using  a  range  of  software  but  very  little  scanning. This time around, many more people are  exploiting  technology  to  recreate  objects  through  scanning and the range of software tends to be the  high-end  commercial  packages  such  as  Rhino  and  Geomagic™.   Although,  as  stated  elsewhere,  most  of  the  professional  software  is  capable  of  nearly  all  tasks.   What  has  significantly  changed  is  the  conceptual  approach  to  3D  printing;  all  the  artists  I  interviewed  use  the  processes  to  develop  a  very  particular  concept,  and  the  technology  is  a  means  to realise that concept  rather than artists striving to  work within the particular constraints demanded by  the limitations of the technology .  However, even if the work is made for you, there is  a clear distinction highlighted by the choices that are  now created between traditional craft processes and  the new, more hands-off or apparently remote, digital  technologies. The traditional craft process offers the  artist  full  personal  control  over  all  aspects  of  the  process  and  utilises  physical  hands-on  experience  to gauge the quality and feel of the work. The new  technologies  offer  a  remote  hands-off  process  that  is quicker and easier and frees the creator from the  responsibility of construction. This is perhaps slightly  different in its theoretical or philosophical approach  from the craftsperson’s traditional understanding of  materiality,  highlighted  in  Chapter  3.  For  example,  these  processes  may  offer  more  to  artists  such  as Karin Sander, for whom the tactile and material  qualities are perhaps less important than conveying  the conceptual context of the work. I believe there is  still a need to understand fully the inherent and tactile  qualities of the material being processed, even if you  are working with it in a more remote fashion.  By  the  late  twentieth  century,  separate  to  the  advent  of  3D  printing,  even  that  final  finishing  undertaken  by  the  master  had  been  handed  to  others. examples of this can be seen in the work of  Jeff Koons, who deliberately seeks out craftspeople  who make a particular range of commercial objects  and  then  has  large-scale  versions  made  by  those  craftspeople  –  there  is  no  intervention  from  Koons  himself. Damien Hirst8 also employs a large band of  artists to create his spot paintings and prints. Hirst  stipulates  a  range  of  colours  in  order  to  create  a  palette and then leaves the studio artists to select  from the palette and paint or print the images to their  own colour choices.  In the first edition of this book, I chose to interview  two  artists,  Tom  Lomax  and  Keith  Brown,  whose  3D-printed practice had started early in the lifespan  of  the  discipline.  Both  have  used  CNC  milling  and  early computer software to create art. Whilst this put  3D  printing  into  context  within  the  fine  arts,  I  feel  that  the  discipline  has  now,  very  quickly,  changed  and matured. I therefore acknowledge that it is now  time  for  my  interviews  and  philosophical  approach  to more closely reflect what has been happening in  the  wider  context  of  3D  printing  in  the  fine  arts.  A  new generation of artists have adopted 3D printing   86  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   86  9 26 17   3:48 PM   CAse sTuDy  MAT COLLIsHAW  Mat Collishaw is a key figure in the important generation  of British artists who emerged from Goldsmiths College  in the late 1980s. He participated in Freeze  1988  and  since his first solo exhibition in 1990 has exhibited widely  internationally. Mat kindly agreed to be interviewed after  we interviewed Sebastian Burdon, who assisted Mat with  the figure for his zoetropes.  I began the interview by asking Mat what led him to using  3D printing in his work. He explained:   —  It wasn’t so much a choice as imperative to a  project that I was doing – I decided I wanted  to start making these 3D zoetropes, and I first  began experimenting using a record deck, using  some little plasticine and blue tack figures on  it and a little strobe I bought from Maplin. It  seemed to work and I got an idea of what I  wanted to do and that involved figures both  animal and human, and it occurred to me  that, to get any kind of accurate registration  of my figures from one to the next – because  it’s basically an animation – the only way to  reproduce them accurately was to use 3D   printing, which was something that I was kind  of aware of, that I knew was out there but that  was still in its infancy as far as the quality goes  and also very expensive. But I thought it would  probably help me out with that project, having  tried to hand model some of those figures, it  gave an aesthetic to the work that I wasn’t that  interested in. It had a very hand made   home  made type of feel to it, and that was a distraction  from what I wanted to do. I wanted all the prints  to be consistent and accurate. And that was all  taking place around 2007.  A zoetrope is an early pre-film animation device producing  an illusion of motion when a sequence of drawings are  viewed through slits in a carousel drum that is rotated.  I  wanted  to  include  3D-printed  zoetropes  in  this  book  because  zoetropes  are  not  so  much  about  3D  printing   demonstrating how to make impossible structures etc. .  They were 3D printed because they couldn’t be done in  any other way. What is interesting about these zoetropes  is that the 3D printing is almost incidental or a by-product   i.e., the zoetrope is what’s important and the 3D printing  is the way of getting there .  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   87  11  Mat Collishaw, ‘All Things  Fall’. 3D-printed zoetrope.  87  9 26 17   3:49 PM   I commented that 2007 was quite early on in the general  acceptance of 3D printing, and Mat confirmed that at that  time he was only vaguely aware of people having used it  in the art world, but had no experience himself. I wanted  to know what proportion of his work currently involved 3D  printing.   —  I’m involved with around four different projects  at the moment and 3D printing is involved in  one, so that is a quarter, but the 3D printing  on that project is so labour intensive that it has  become around 70 per cent of the project. I’m  also doing projects involving oil painting and  wet colloidal photography and a virtual reality  project. There’s another 3D zoetrope that I have  just finished this week – that project has about  308 different figures on it – birds and flowers  this time, and it also has a ground with a a little  scree and a background incorporated, so again  hundreds and hundreds of little figures that have  to be animated, broken up into figures, and then  have to be 3D printed, hand finished, then hand  painted.  12  Mat Collishaw, ‘Seria Ludo’  zoetropes before and also a guy called Steve  Tippet. They work with me on the mechanical  and electrical engineering – sorting out the  motors and the technical aspects of the work. I  am also working with Sebastian Burdon on the  design and modelling of the figures, as well as  several painters to hand paint the figures  who  are mainly interns and art students  to do all the  paintwork which is a very big requirement on this  project.  I’m also making a little film of people wrestling,  which we break down into one-second clips and  then animate movement. I send these to my  designer to make into little animations where  we might get one of the arms to move a little  bit faster, so there is a great deal of back and  forth, and it takes many months to make. The  last zoetrope took about six months’ work before  they were finally 3D printed, and we’ll never use  the same bureau – we’ll send it to three different  companies to get the best price.  I then asked if Mat made all that work himself or whether  he had a team of people working for him. He outlined his  collaborative approach:  I commented that his approach sounded interesting and  quite different to the way other artists work when using  3D printing. Mat elaborated:  I have been working with a company called  Whitewall with whom I made some of my    —  The first work we did back in 2007 – the  company I was working with bought their own  3D printer, and it quickly became redundant.    —   —  88  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   88  9 26 17   3:49 PM   I think a lot of people were saying that 3D  printing is the next big thing: ‘lets get one for  the office’ etc., then they realised the problems  with calibration and the requirement to use quite  toxic and messy chemicals that are involved, and  perhaps it wasn’t that easy. And, of course, now  things are changing so quickly that in a year’s  time your machine is redundant. So I’ve found  it’s a lot easier to deal with companies who are  dealing exclusively with 3D printing as they are  constantly updating their hardware, materials  and software.  I commented that I find that we are constantly upgrading  equipment  and  testing  new  materials  and  methods.  As  Mat had touched on some of the barriers to 3D printing,  did he think think there were others?   —  In terms of things it restricts me from doing? At  the moment, for me it’s a problem with colour.  It takes so much time to ascribe colour to my  little models, and the work becomes very labour  intensive. Also, the colour machines I have seen  are kind of OK but not brilliant. But perhaps I’m  behind the times with that a little bit. In addition,  they’re way more expensive than the standard  white nylon, and for me it’s cheaper to print in  white, black or grey and then hand paint the   colour on. It also gives me the opportunity to use  iridescent paint, matte varnish or gloss varnish  and all sorts of other finishes that you would  struggle to get with a 3D printer.  Mat continued:   —  So probably that aspect is the most difficult for  me at the moment, and also the slight ribbing  effect in the print from the layers, and for the  zoetrope you’re using for [the artwork] ‘All Things  Fall’. We spent weeks on that – sanding and then  painting and sanding – to get the right sort of  finish on it, but now a couple of years down the  line that isn’t so much of a problem, and prints  are really smooth when they come back.  I  remarked  that  things  have  definitely  changed  as  the  definition has improved – the materials hadn’t improved,  but the definition in the final 3D prints had gotten better.  Mat also encountered further problems:   —  Another problem was just the actual point as to  how thin a print could go and its robustness, but  now they are more robust, so we are printing at  3 mm and around 7 cm at the moment and it’s  great – for example, a chandelier I have done. I  have a little model of a man peeing and a little   13  Mat Collishaw, ‘All  Things Fall’. 3D-printed  zoetrope.  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   89  89  9 26 17   3:49 PM   arc of piss, and it’s printed in fine acrylic and it  looks absolutely fine even when we’re spinning  round at 60 times a second, so, in terms of the  actual definition and the strength, that all seems  to be where I need it to be.  Finally, I wanted to know what Mat saw as the future of  3D printing in his work.  Well what I would like to do is make the  zoetropes I’m making much smaller because,  although they’re great as they are, they become  very difficult to place and to handle and, for a  gallery, to exhibit – and also quite expensive,  which increases the sale price, so what I would  really like is to make them smaller and easier to  host, so that they could be displayed in a more  domestic environment where I could make them  more saleable [. . .] so that’s the problem I’m  trying to resolve at the moment – how to I take  a piece that’s around 1 M 20 wide and bring it  down to about 30 cm?  This week I have been trying to figure out how  to separate printed parts within the overall  sculpture parts that you could never really reach  with your hands. I can reduce everything in size,  so at the moment they are printed as a single  large piece, and I have to be careful things don’t  become too thin and therefore unprintable. So  it would be good break them down into smaller  pieces – also of a size where I can reach in with  a paintbrush and then assemble them afterwards  because at the moment it’s a massive assembly  job. So it would be good to try and break it down  into smaller pieces then paint them. I would  also like to do more 3D printing with different  sculptors and artists because I’m always looking  for something new, but I haven’t come up with  many ideas yet. I have made around eight or  nine of these zoetropes that have all used 3D  printing, so it would be nice to branch out and  make some different sculptures.   —   —  90  14  Mat Collishaw, ‘All Things Fall’. 3D-printed zoetrope.  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   90  9 26 17   3:49 PM   CAse sTuDy  sOPHIe KAHN  Sophie  Kahn’s  sculptures  have  a  timeless  quality  that  belies  their  production  process.  They  have  an  initial  appearance  of  Greek  or  Roman  classical  sculpture,  before  one  rapidly  realises  how  contemporary  these  works are. Like all three of the artists interviewed here,  Sophie  also  makes  photographs  and  installations,  in  addition  to  running  a  professional  3D  scanning  service  for others.  Sophie Kahn is a New York–based artist who was born  in London and grew up in Melbourne before returning to  London to study Fine Art and Art History at Goldsmiths.  Sophie  describes  her  art  practice:  ‘My  work  owes  its  fragmented  aesthetic  to  the  interaction  of  new  and  old  media,  or  the  digital  and  the  analogue.  I  combine  cutting edge technology, like 3D laser scanning and 3D  printing, with ancient bronze casting techniques. I create  sculptures  and  videos  that  resemble  de-constructed  monuments  or  memorials.  They  engage  questions  of  time, history, vision, identity and the body’.  originally  a  photographer  Sophie  describes  herself  ‘as  an artist’ and her professional practice as 'digital artist’,  citing Paddy Johnson, the founding editor of Art F City, who  writes that ‘new media artists manipulate technologies to   15  Sophie Kahn, Artifact  exhibition  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   91  16  Sophie Kahn, Body Traces  91  9 26 17   3:49 PM   create new work . . . digital artists . . . use technology as  a tool.’9   —  Sophie continues:   —  My work is very much about materialisation.  Whether that’s a sculptural work, a print in  a gallery or any physical theme an audience  member comes and engages with. Digital is  purely a realm an object goes through on its way  to materialisation, but it’s still a sculpture to me;  I also really like the definition of 3D printing from  Chicago Professor Claudia Hart – ‘3D is a hybrid  form of photography and sculpture’ – a cross  between those two art forms. 3D scanning is  working from life, but it is digitally mediated.  In  this  sense  I  agree  with  Sophie’s  definition,  but  it  begs the question as to whether there are two forms of  syntax  for  3D  printing:  one  leading  back  to  Beaman’s  view  of  photosculpture  and  a  second  that  might  be  seen  as  a  digital analogue  approach  of  first  building  a  virtual ‘manual’ artefact on screen  as is the case with  Sebastian  Burdon   and  then  outputting  this  analogue- generated artefact.  Sophie first encountered 3D printing and scanning around  2003.  She  was  a  photographer  at  the  time,  living  in  London, having completed her undergraduate course at  Goldsmiths. She then returned to Australia and studied  at  RMIT  at  the  Spatial  Information  Architectural  Lab  in  Melbourne.   —  The Institute was working on a project in  Barcelona under Professor Mark Burry, who  was reconstructing Gaudi’s original maquettes  for the Sagrada Familia using an early 3D wax  printer and scanner by reverse engineering,  then working in Parametric software to try  and get really precise data from the models  in order to predict how Gaudi was going to  finish the Sagrada Familia. [. . .] That is where  I first encountered the technology, and from a  photography background I was really intrigued  by the fact that the 3D scanner was reacting to  the things that existed in the world rather than  ‘a blank 3D canvas’. I was never that skilled at  3D modeling from scratch, but that idea of taking  scans of real things and mediating them was  really interesting to me, so that was what got it  all started.   —  92  For a number of years, the technology was     really hard to access. Only universities or big  engineering companies had the resources for it  and charged zillions of dollars for printing, so I  had lots of files I couldn’t really do anything with.  I was making and rendering prints and trying to  get that work published and find a foothold in the  photography sphere, but it was rejected as being  ‘not photography’. Now I think there is a wider  acceptance of the digital in photography, which  is gratifying for me because I always wanted  that early work to be recognised for what it was.  In addition to doing a lot of 2D work, it was  really with companies like Shapeways™ and the  consumer aspect of 3D printing where I could  really make sculpture properly, so it was six to  eight years until I went into 3D print. I was never  that much into the DIY 3D printers, which require  a completely different skill set because the users  are also technical engineers and ‘tinkerers’ and  like repairing machines. Some artists are good  at that sort of thing and for others it’s not really  what we’re about. I really had to wait for stuff  that was more end-user friendly, service bureaus  like Shapeways™ and user-friendly 3D printing  software like NetFabb™, so then that really  changed my practice.  It’s about 50 per cent at the moment – I do video  work as well, and I make 2D prints alongside  the 3D prints. I’m increasingly having the 3D  prints cast in metal, which is the result of market  pressure. It’s been my experience within the art  world that customers don’t really want to buy  solely 3D-printed pieces because they’re worried  about the archival implications. Now with the cast  prints – they are cast onto an aluminum frame  that’s powder coated white, it’s very expensive  and a bit plain, but they do last, and it’s still  cheaper than metal printing  i.e., laser sintering ,  and also my prints aren’t that large. The 3D print  is really just to get the masters for the casting,  and then those go to the foundry. The final  objects are not strictly 3D prints anymore, but the  work has been fed through the process. In some  pieces I had my foundry rub pigment into the  build lines, so it’s very obvious that the work has   When I asked Sophie what proportion of her work was 3D  printed, she replied:  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   92  9 26 17   3:49 PM   My friends and colleagues have decades of  experience in the industry behind us, but we all  still have tremendous headaches getting things  to work. Many other people get stuck and end  up paying somebody to do things for them.  And there isn’t really an educational halfway  solution that bridges the gap. So together with  a group of friends, I founded an organization  in New York called The Lady Tech Guild. We all  work in 3D print, we support like-minded girls  and women to become resourceful, inspired  creative professionals. We are all self-taught  and there isn’t a single pathway to do what  we do. Often the answer to a problem is found  through Google® or looking on YouTube®, but not  everyone has the time to do all that. So that has  really been the biggest barrier.  I asked Sophie whether, as an artist, she thought she was  giving up her traditional craft skills, or if she thought 3D  printing had its own craft sensibilities. Sophie responded:  Oh, definitely the latter. I must confess I  didn’t really have any traditional craft skills  such as drawing or painting, so this work was  the only option for me! I also think there are  more conservative branches of the traditional  crafts that are very worried about the new 3D  technology – traditional sculptors, for example.  But I really see 3D print and 3D design as a  separate skillset, and one that deserves the  same level of respect. I feel that 3D print   this kind of circuitry, that digital artefact, which is  really important to me.   —  When I enquired why she used 3D printing in her work,  Sophie replied:   —   —   —  It’s a big question to answer! Partly it’s a  question of access to materials. I was between  schools for a long time, I didn’t have access to  a foundry or kiln, and I couldn’t afford expensive  fabrication, so there was no way I could make  work in clay or metal otherwise. Being able to  produce small pieces in those materials was  liberating, but the quality still wasn’t there; it’s  my hope that that will change with time.  I queried Sophie further: If she used 3D print in a piece  of work, was it solely created with 3D printing or did she  combine it with traditional technologies? She responded,  Yes, it’s very much like one piece in a workflow  for me, and also I have to consider budgets and  practicality. So whilst I would like to do more 3D  printing and less foundry work, I also think at the  consumer level the technology just isn’t there  yet, especially at that scale, so really my work  has to be as it is at the moment.   —  on a practical level, Sophie uses Rhino™ for the meshes  and Netfabb for 80 per cent of her work, including cleaning  3D  designs  and  repairing  meshes.  She  uses  Adobe  Photoshop® ‘quite a lot – just for the aesthetics’ and also  Autodesk Maya and Mudbox™ for sculpting. Sophie then  outlined the various hardware she uses to create her work.  So, for the scanner, I mainly use the Polhemus®  handheld laser scanner – an old scanner from  2003 – but it has a very specific ‘artefacting’ that I  like. Most of the actual 3D printing is done for me  by Shapeways™. I did have a go with a Makerbot™   during a residency  and the foundry are currently  burning those out as a test. They came out  ‘screwed up’, which I actually kind of like, but  burning off the PLA is a very toxic process.  Sophie  has  strong  views  on  the  barriers  to  using  3D  printing:  primarily  education  and  a  lack  of  user  friendliness, which prevents more engagement with the  3D print technology.  17  Sophie Kahn, Bust of a Woman with Head Thrown Back  93  9 26 17   3:49 PM  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   93   democratises access to certain materials: for  artists and designers who don’t have access  to kilns or foundries, and who may not have a  traditional craft education, there are still pathways  to working in metal and clay. I did my education  somewhat backwards, in that I first learned  the digital skills and then studied moldmaking,  casting and ceramics during graduate school,  so 3D printing actually led me to traditional craft  skills.  It  is  interesting  to  note  that  both  Sophie  Kahn  and  Jonathan  Monaghan  state  that  they  do  not  have  traditional drawing skills. I am a firm advocate of using  both pencil and software. I see drawing on a computer as  a traditional skill. A pencil is a means of conveying what  you  see,  or  what  you  think  you  see,  mediated  by  what  you  are  thinking.  A  drawing  programme  is  no  different.  Whether there is a difference in adjusting a scan, I am not  sure. It falls more into the realm of collage or sculpting,  so in essence it is also a traditional skill.  Sophie sees the future of 3D printing as really promising:  What has been really interesting and gratifying  to me is that there weren’t many people doing  3D printing for a long time, and now I find more  and more of my peers working in 3D every year.  There has been this huge explosion in artists  using 3D software, but I don’t think a lot of those  artists do a lot of actual 3D printing. It’s the ones  who now have galleries behind them who are  now able to afford to print pieces in marble, for  example, or send them off to a specialist in Italy  for carving, so you still really need the resources  to make successful work, and I think the art  market is starting to embrace 3D print, but there  are still lots of artists who are using 3D software  but have to stick to the virtual world because  they lack the resources to 3D print the work.   —  94  18  Sophie Kahn, ‘Head of a Young Woman’, 2004.

The faux fur in the centre  creates a discordance with  the sharp and clinical filigree.  Courtesy of bitforms gallery,  New York  Jonathan  Monaghan  is  a  multidisciplinary  artist  whose  work  spans  print,  sculpture  and  3D  printing.  The  Bitforms  Gallery  in  New  York,  who  represent  Jonathan,  describe  his  work  thus:  ‘Jonathan  challenges  the  real,  the  imagined  and  the  virtual.  Drawing  on  a  wide  range  of sources from science fiction to Baroque architecture,  he creates bizarre, yet compelling narratives and imagery  with the same high-end technology used in Hollywood or  by video game designers’. Jonathan is an exemplar who  spans the divide articulated by Sophie Kahn between new  media  and  digital  arts.  When  I  interviewed  Jonathan,  I  was  interested  in  his  3D  printing  practice  because  he  works in a wide range of different digital media. Jonathan  told me:  Jonathan  describes  himself  as  ‘an  artist’  both  in  his  personal and professional practice. He elaborated further  by  defining  himself  ‘as  an  artist  definitely,  because  I  have  lots  of  shows,  exhibitions,  festivals,  and  I  exhibit  my  3D  prints  alongside  my  live  animated  films  and  two-dimensional  prints,  and  they  are  often  thematically  related’.  I  was  interested  in  how  Jonathan  became  involved  in  3D printing. Jonathan began to use 3D printing back in  college   New  York  Institute  of  Technology .  He  first  got  into 3D modelling and graphics through designing video  games in high school.   —  It’s interesting for me because 3D printing  involves a lot of 3D modelling and a lot of  computer work and that’s mostly what I do,  modelling things, and sometimes those are  3D printed and sometimes they will become  animated films. So all of my work originates  in the virtual computer space, but sometimes  the work manifests itself in the real world as  physical sculpture. So 3D printing and sculpture  are an important part of my artistic practice and  research, so maybe a third of my time is devoted  to that.   —  I used to design video game levels on my own in  high school. I was a bit of a geek! And then after  high school, I started teaching myself high-end  3D modelling and animation software. When I  got to college they had a 3D printer – a Stratasys  Dimension™ – and some of the faculty were  involved with it, and I made my first piece – my  first physical sculpture – using 3D printing. It was  great, and I was always very interested in trying  to use the process to make artwork that you  really can’t make in any other way. That’s what  really excited me because I already had half the  modelling skills from my other work that I could   9781474248679_txt_app.indb   95  95  9 26 17   3:50 PM   When I asked Jonathan why he used 3D printing and which  specific  qualities  he  thought  it  offered  over  traditional  processes, he replied:   —  For me, I was a computer geek first, before I  was ever an artist – I mean I’m not that good at  working with my hands, and this was why I was  always creative on the computer. I don’t have  the dexterity or the skills to do an ivory carving  or a woodcarving, and maybe I could learn, but  then I already have all this knowledge available  I could use for the same kind of work, just  with a different kind of process, so, yes, what  excited me was the ability to create anything,  there is no limit to the forms you can produce  using 3D modelling and, theoretically, just being  able to press a button and have that model  physically manifest is so exciting for me – my  earliest sculptures were highly detailed and  highly complex with crevices and inner parts,  little details that were inspired by intricate ivory  carving or wood carvings from the Gothic period.  I don’t have the abilities to make that in any  other medium, and that’s what attracted me to  the fluidity of working with the virtual space and  the physical space and how that breaks down  barriers.  22  Jonathan Monaghan, Roy, 2015, 3D-printed porcelain, 3D-printed 18K  gold plated brass, 4.6 x 2.5 x 7.5 in   11.7 x 6.4 x 19.1 cm, edition of 5,  3D printed in materials associated with decorative arts, Roy is both sci-fi  and Baroque.

I’d ask myself, ‘So what’s worth making?’  and I decided I wanted to make artefacts that  say something or that have an intellectual or  emotional value, but I also wanted to make  things that you couldn’t make in any other way.  So hence the work has always been highly  detailed.  Jonathan uses a variety of software in his work – some of  which is free and some of which is paid for, but he tries to  use whatever is best for the particular job: ‘everything from  Rhino™ through to Blender™ or Geomagic™ or whatever  makes sense for the work’. Hardware for Jonathan, as for  most artists, is a question of access and cost:  Jonathan made his first 3D-printed model around 2006.  I noted that most of the people whom I had interviewed  also started to use the technology at around that time.  Jonathan commented:   —  It must have been the zeitgeist or something – as  an undergrad I was involved in this project with  Autodesk® called the ‘Digital Stone Exhibition’,  where four artists were tasked with making  traditional large granite sculptures, but they were  all designed on the computer, and we 3D printed  the maquettes; then expert stone carvers used  those maquettes to create these larger pieces.  [This was] back in 2008. I was involved in that  whole project, which was also a big learning  experience.  It depends. I’ve been working a lot with  Shapeways®, and I did a residency at  Makerbot™ industries for a little while and we  worked on projects that were a little different  from my body of work as an artist, but the  Makerbots have a little less capability, which  you have to work around, but I’m really excited  with what Shapeways is doing – going to  much bigger scales in nylon, and I can really  get nice detail. There are still barriers: Cost is  still an issue and limits how much work I can  produce or get completely crazy with, and there  are still size limitations, but all these things  are changing. One of my pieces is 3D-printed  porcelain combined with 3D-printed gold.  3D printing is always improving, but some    —  96  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   96  9 26 17   3:50 PM   23  Jonathan Monaghan,  Agnus Dei  After  Zurbarán  Carrara  marble, 3D-printed steel,  30 x 20 x 9.5 inches    76 x 51 x 24.1 cm.

He  described the time taken:  Whilst  Jonathan  previously  stated  that  he  didn’t  have  much in the way of craft skills, I was still very interested  in his views on ‘the craft of the digital’ and whether he  thought there was a loss of traditional skills as a result.  Jonathan responded:   —   —  It really depends, they are all part of different  bodies of work – for example, the works with  a Beaux-Arts Façade that look like a luxury  apartment building, you’ll see that same façade  in the 3D prints and in the the 2D prints and  also in the animation I exhibit alongside the  pieces. So the visual content I make works   Any artist who works in a particular medium  needs to consider the nature of that medium.  As artists we want to convey our ideas and  experiences, but at the same time it’s also  important to be consider the medium that we’re  working with. But, yes, I do think there is a level  of craftsmanship to the work I do; some of my  films are deliberately sharp and seductive, and  my 3D sculptures are also sharp and seductive  to compliment them – a lot of what I am  referencing in my work are the decorative arts  from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,  for example – highly detailed gold ornamentation  and highly detailed carvings – I’m referencing  those things so, yes, the craftsmanship is  definitely there, and they certainly take a long  time to make! And these digital craft skills are  always improving as I’m learning, which is all  part of the challenge and excitement of working  with this medium.  Given the complexity of the work, I was interested in how  long it took Jonathan to make a typical piece. I was also   24  Jonathan Monaghan, Recumbent Bull, powder coated aluminium,  3D-printed steel, 6.5 x 14.5 x 6.5 inches   16.5 x 36.8 x 16.5 cm.

It’s really tough to separate  that out and quantify the time it takes to make  each piece because they are all part of the wider  investigation.  Given  the  breadth  of  Jonathan’s  personal  practice,  I  wanted to know where he saw the future of 3D print for  his personal practice.   —  Hopefully, in my career, as I begin to develop  my work more, I want to be ambitious with my  work and with the technology, pushing it as  far as it will go, and continue to make things  that I didn’t think were possible a few years  ago – bigger installations in 3D printing – as  impressive and big and crazy as I can make!  Hopefully this will draw more people in to see the  shows and to think more about the technology.  I’ve always been operating in the ‘artworld’  with sculpting and painting – and 3D printing  remains a valuable and powerful tool for creative  expression and artistic investigation. Although  it’s still very much in development, I think I’ve  always tried to get around the gimmick of it. To  create work that you might not be able to tell is  3D printed, that’s what is exciting for me: getting  people to think about the bigger philosophical  ideas behind the work, not just how it was made.  I’ve been doing this for a while, so I have seen  3D printing change from this almost unheard  of thing to, in 2011 – when I was at Makerbot  as artist in residence when Makerbot were still  open source – there seemed to be this explosion  around 3D printing in the press, which I guess   25  A Pocket Full of Sunshine, Detail, 2015.

There’s still a  lot of hype now, but that helps raise the profile  of 3D printing too. But it’s a little harder to see  the real value of actual 3D printing sometimes  because there’s still so much [hype]. It could  change the world, but not yet.  98  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   98  9 26 17   3:50 PM   CAse sTuDy  seBAsTIAN BuRDON  Sebastian Burdon describes himself as an artist, but for  his professional practice he describes himself as ‘Artist  Hyphen  Designer’  ‘because  we  are  living  in  an  era  of  hyphens and everyone has a mixture of disciplines’.  Since  2004  Sebastian  has  explored  various  branches  of  the  creative  industry:  print  and  TV,  games  for  PlayStation™,  mobile  and  online  casinos,  architectural  visualisation,  VFX,  advertising  and  3D  printing.  He  has  been heavily involved with the world of contemporary art,  participating  in  projects  that  are  exhibited  in  London,  New York, Verona and Berlin. He owns and runs Creative  Not, a small London-based independent creative design  studio. When I asked Sebastian how he first got started  in 3D printing, he replied:   —   —  Around 2009, when I did my first zoetrope ‘The  Garden of Earthly Delights’ for Mat Collishaw.  Back then I was working for an architectural  visualisation company and we made small  models of how buildings would look. At that  time I wasn’t 3D printing the models, but it was   happening around me – of course, back then  it was referred to as rapid prototyping. The job  I had before that, I was working at a gaming  company making animations for video games  and the animations have to be quite short and  looped, so if you have a soldier shooting an  arrow, for example, the loop would return to the  original position. So I have a background in video  game animation and architectural prototyping.  I asked Sebastian how he first came to collaborate with  Mat Collishaw. He replied:  Well, it was a lucky accident, the company I  was working for at the time  the architects  was  next to an art installation company, where Mat  Collishaw was working. When it came to the  zoetrope and the architectural modeling, they  asked, ‘We have this project – can anyone do it?’  And I was listening and thought ‘I can do that! I  can make modelling for 3D printing and have the  experience to animate it as well.’ Subsequently   9781474248679_txt_app.indb   99  26  Sebastian Burdon,  Masterpiece by Whatsisname.  3D-printed artwork.  99  9 26 17   3:50 PM   Mat Collishaw contacted me privately and asked  me whether I could do it. We have now made  about seven zoetropes, big and small. We made  a large version and a small version of ‘The  Garden of Earthly Delights’.  The early ones were printed in London by  Whitewall, the art installation company, and they  bought the 3D printers precisely for that project.  In 2009 the 3D printers still showed a lot of  layers and lines, so the individual models from  that zoetrope, if you examined them closely, you  could see these thick lines of plastic, and then  they were painted, but not smoothed down very  much.  When  asked  what  proportion  his  work  involves  3D  printing, Sebastian replied:  It’s getting more and more year on year, but this  year I have done the most – around 50 per cent  mainly because I made two more zoetropes for  Matt, one in Yorkshire and one for Tasmania.  Then there’s some game pieces for board games  for a company called Specialist Models.  When I asked why he uses 3D printing, he replied, ‘Mainly  because it’s in line with my bread and butter business,  which is 3D animation, so it was a natural progression  towards 3D printing, and you can’t really avoid it if you’re  in that area of design, modelling and scanning.’  on  the  subject  of  scanning,  Sebastian  states,  ‘The  definition  of  a  scan  has  got  much  better  and  captures  much finer details, like a crack in the paint on a wall, for  example.’ I asked if he scans first and then renders or if  he just renders the design directly on screen. He replied,  ‘I don’t scan. Sometimes I purchase scanned models, so  for one project I purchased some scanned environments  of the ground, for example. I don’t scan the characters  for the zoetrope first; I just start from scratch and model  them.’   —  When I asked what software he used, Sebastian said, ‘I  use Adobe 3ds™ and Pixologic ZBrush™ for the detailed  sculptural work and high resolution files. I’m using more  Maxon Cinema 4D™ lately as it’s become more popular  in  London  and  the  3D  modelling animated  graphics  industry, so those three products mainly.’  27  Sebastian Burdon, Red Puppy Dog Lamp by Whatsisname.  I  asked  if  there  was  a  regular  individual  or  3D  printing  bureau  he  used.  He  said,  ‘For  my  personal  projects,  I  often use my desktop 3D printer Ultimaker 3. Additionally  I  often  use  Shapeways®  because,  for  me,  it’s  the  easiest, and they check the file for errors and thickness  for printing, which some of the software just can’t do.’  When  I  asked  Sebastian,  ‘What  are  the  barriers  to  3D  printing?  Do  you  get  frustrated  by  the  technology?’  he  replied,  in  contrast  to  everyone  else  I  interviewed,  ‘No;  nothing, really.’ I presumed this was because Sebastian  has a background in 3D modelling for film and animation,  so grasping the intricacies of 3D CAD modelling was less  of an issue for him. I asked if, as an artist, he felt he had  given up traditional craft skills or if he thought 3D printing  had its own craft skill. He replied:  It definitely has its own craft skill because I can  do great 3D models, but I can’t draw a straight  line! I like to stick to the digital because I have  more control over it. So, sculpting characters  with Z brush, for example, you need lots of  sculpting skill to make the human physique  and those are the same skills you would need  for traditional sculpture, but it’s got its own set  of requirements, and I don’t think a traditional    —   —  100  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   100  9 26 17   3:50 PM   sculptor would find it easy to switch to 3D. It  would take a while and vice versa. The bottom  line is if someone is a bad designer, then their  3D prints will look terrible too.  I  questioned  Sebastian  as  to  where  he  saw  the  future  of  3D  printing,  as  he  is  both  an  artist  and  a  creative  company. Sebastian said,   —   —  I think there will be more and more entry level  people getting involved in 3D printing. For  example, the board game pieces I have been  making were for a tiny company where the  easiest way they could get them made was  through 3D printing; otherwise, they would have  had to be manually sculpted, so it solved a lot of  issues for them. And for artists, as well – I have  a little balloon dog from the company Kid Robot  made of some sort of rubbery plastic. For me to  make that out of clay would take days, and then  I probably couldn’t do it. It would take an hour to  3D model and print.  I also expect to expand my work into more  areas – for example, prototyping for small  companies with limited editions. I recently made  a bottle for a small company who wanted some  limited edition models before production. This  is where I think you really have to go through  that process to make a design; then, after that,  you can begin to push things further, before you  can go to full-scale manufacturing. I think about  how 3D printing affects creativity, and all these  designs are online now, and it inspires me to  think how I would go about making the same  thing in the traditional sense, and it’s opened  up a lot of ideas [. . .] In 3D printing, there are   no limits to what you can make. Also with the  next generation of artists, including those still in  school, even in primary schools – they have 3D  printers, and kids can play with basic shapes and  produce simple models. Those people will have  a very different outlook on 3D printing compared  to either of us. Also, there is the price limitation,  although the smaller artefacts are cheaper.  Anything over that sort of standard size and the  printing cost rises exponentially. I did a piece of  work where I had a model of a Great Dane, and it  would have cost so much that it was far cheaper,  quicker and easier to make a polystyrene and  clay model instead. But, essentially, it’s still  modelling the same design.  28  Sebastian Burdon, PoPek Balloon Dog by Whatsisname. 3D-printed  prototype used for mould making.  1  Fujihata, M.

Therefore, in order to explore the way designers use 3D printing,  I have decided to split the various design disciplines into two categories –  industrial designers in large corporations and lone  or small  studio design  entrepreneurs.  The  first  category  is  composed  of  those  industrial  designers who work within larger corporations, where  design is integral to the company product s . In this  arena  3D  printing  for  rapid  prototyping  has  been  the  norm  for  the  last  ten  years,  which  is  primarily  due  to  the  larger  resources  of  big  companies.  Formula  1  racing  teams  such  as  Lotus  Renault™  and  Red  Bull™  as  well  as  luxury  multi-national  car  companies  such  as  Aston  Martin™  and  Bentley™1  all use 3D rapid prototyping to experiment with new  body  shapes  and  parts.  Footwear  companies  from  Adidas™ to Clarkes™2 use 3D design for both shoes  and  different  sole  types  and  patterns.  Ceramic  companies  such  as  Denby  Potteries™  and  Costa  Verde™ have also used the technology for a number  of years.  Toy companies such as MakieLab™ and Disney™  also  use  3D  printing  as  it  allows  them  to  respond  quickly to market demands or the latest craze and try  new designs without having to create specialist tooling.3 Children’s  entertainment  giant  Disney  have  recently  filed  a  series  of  patents  for  a  new  type  of  3D printer that does not build in layers but instead  uses  a  projected  light  image  from  two  different  directions to create and solidify the whole model. If  this patent comes to fruition, then Disney will have  radically altered the field of 3D printing.4 They have  also  recently  filed  a  patent  for  a  layered  form  of  textile printer, much like the Mcor LoM machine  see  Chapter  2   but  using  soft  fabric  instead  of  paper.  What  these  patents  show  is  that  Disney  is  very  invested in the field of 3D printing.  102  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   102  9 26 17   3:50 PM   1  Femur Stool, Assa Ashuach, designed and data engineered by Assa Ashuach Studios, London.  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   103  103  9 26 17   3:50 PM   2  3  Whilst  this  brief  assessment  may  only  cover  a  small  number  of  companies  and  a  relatively  small  number of designers, this group is by far the biggest  user  of  3D  technology,  measured  by  production  volume  and  influence  on  the  development  of  the  sector.  In  the  second  category  are  the  lone  designer  entrepreneurs  who  typically  make  artefacts  to  sell  direct  to  the  public.  This  is  exemplified  by  Assa  Ashuach, Lionel Dean and the Dutch designers Bram  Geenan and Jann Kyttanen, formerly of Freedom of  Creation,  who5  are  probably  best  known  for  their  iPhone cases and for the Gaudi Chair, one of the first  pieces of furniture to be printed in an SLS  selective  laser sintered  nylon and carbon fibre.  Another group of designers that I have included  in this category are the 3D printed jewellery makers,  who  define  themselves  as  designers  rather  than  as  craftspeople.  Jewellers  often  use  3D  rapid  prototyping  because  the  economics  of  producing  many small parts in one build make it more viable to  use expensive technology and materials. I have also  chosen  to  differentiate  between  classic  jeweller  silversmiths and craftspeople such as Jack Row and  Marianne Forrest  where material qualities and craft  skills are essential to their practice  and designers   who  make  bespoke  jewellery  using  3D  printing  –  one  of  the  best  examples  would  be  the  Boston- based duo Nervous System™. Founded in 2007 by  Jessica  Rosenkrantz  and  Jesse  Louis-Rosenberg,  Nervous  System  are  a  design  team  who  trained  in  architecture, biology and mathematics at MIT. They  mainly make laser sintered nylon and metal jewellery,  but  they  also  create  puzzles  and  lamps.  Nervous  System jewellery designs are often based upon self- generating  mathematical  algorithms  and  complex  mathematical  jigsaw  puzzles.  I  would  argue  that  Nervous System make jewellery not because of the  material qualities inherent in the material it is made  from,  but  to  create  an  object  that  is  economically  viable but which still contains the qualities they are  seeking through a 3D-generated, digitally conceived  work.  over  the  years  Nervous  System  has  built  a  successful web-based business that sells innovative  design  that  is  3D  printed  to  order,  direct  to  the  public.  The  Nervous  System  website  outlines  their  core design philosophy:6  We  created  Nervous  System  to  explore  a  design  approach  that  relates  process  and  form  in  a  context  of  interactivity  and  openness.  Our  trajectory  focuses  on  generative  design  methods  using  both  algorithmic   104  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   104  9 26 17   3:50 PM   4  5  and  physical  tools  to  create  innovative  products  and  environments.  Formally  we  are  attracted  to  complex  and  unconventional  geometries.  Our  inspirations  are  grounded  in  the  natural  forms  and  corresponding  processes which construct the world around us. From  coral aggregations to interference patterns, a study of  natural  phenomena  is  an  essential  ingredient  to  our  design process.  When  approaching  the  topic  of  creative  users  of  3D  printing,  the  first  problem  encountered  is  how  these  creative  people  define  themselves.  Designers  are  among  the  hardest  of  the  creative  disciplines to categorise, specifically in how they see  themselves and their practice. I interviewed a range  of  designers  for  this  book  and  noted  how  similar  design practitioners variously described themselves  to  have  roles  ranging  from  industrial  designer  to  artist. However, it is clear that some categorisation  can  occur  if  one  looks  at  the  approach  taken  to  designing  a  functional  object.  For  example,  Lionel  Dean uses 3D printing technology to create objects  that  are  usually  finished  and  functional  straight  from the printer and so can easily be reproduced as  multiples.  Conversely,  Marianne  Forrest  produces  works that can take an extraordinary length of time   2  Bram Geenen, ‘Freedom of  Creation Gaudi Chair’.

In the case of her Paeleolith  watch,  it  took  six  months  to  clean  a  one-off  piece.  Another  example  is  product  designer  Dr  Peter  Walters, who uses 3D printing both to make artwork  for  exhibition  and  as  a  means  of  producing  one-off  research  models  of  flexible  actuators  and  ceramic  fuel cells – these are both elements of an on-going  arts and robotics collaboration. Laura Alvarado and  Vivian Meller have more of an artistic approach that  highlights  the  failures  and  limitations  of  the  3D  scanning and printing process.  In my view, design as a discipline has engaged  the most with 3D printing within the visual arts. This  is perhaps because designers are taught to use CAD  software from a much earlier stage in their education.   9781474248679_txt_app.indb   105  105  9 26 17   3:50 PM   6  106  7  of all of the creative practitioners I interviewed about  their use of 3D printing, it is the designers who are  the closest to having an industrial philosophy in the  way the technology is used. Many designers use the  technology  for  prototyping  to  show  to  a  client  and  resolve the visual and technical form details.  An early commercial example of using 3D printing  for  prototyping  is  found  in  the  vases  and  lights  made  for  the  Milan  Furniture  Fair  in  2000  by  the  designer Ron Arad.7 In ‘Not Made by Hand Not Made  in  China’,  the  vases  and  lights  were  created  from  ‘virtual  prototypes’.  The  range  of  lamps  comprised  twelve  items  based  around  a  spiral  design.  The  3D image on a screen could be animated by being  literally bounced around and by stretching the image  into  various  shapes.  Those  frozen  frames  and  the  shape at the time became the template. The frame of  the object was then built by SLS machine, potentially  with an infinite number of variations.  To cite a more recent example, Denby Potteries  use  older   3D  Systems   Z  Corp  510™  and  310  printers™ to produce all of their design prototypes in  order to understand the aesthetics and form of a new  shape. The Denby pottery dates back to 1809 when  the  company  started  producing  salt-glazed  pottery  and soon built an international reputation for its good  quality  bottles  and  jars.  In  the  late  1800s  Denby  Pottery diversified by extending its kitchenware range  and  developed  the  richly  coloured  glazes  that  were  to become and remain Denby’s trademark. In recent  years Denby have further diversified by producing a   wide range of designer kitchen and household items  beyond ceramics.  Before   they  adopted  3D  printing,  Denby’s  designers would produce drawings, which were then  transcribed  to  a  clay  copy,  from  which  they  made  a  plaster  mould  –  of  a  handle,  for  instance  –  that  would have to be carved from a block of plaster. The  timescale from conception to plaster prototype could  be as long as three weeks. Denby can now print a  concept model overnight and print up to eight models  in one printing.  Denby chose Z Corp because, in essence, the Z  Corp process prints plaster models – the closest 3D  print  technique  to  the  Denby  traditional  prototyping  process.  Gary  Hawley,  Denby’s  senior  designer,  explains  that  one  of  the  unexpected  benefits  for  Denby is the ability to ramp up models for production  for casting items that use ceramic casting slip.  In  order  to  cut  timescales  from  concept  model  to production, they will take a handle, for example,  that they had designed, and then add feeds for the  clay  slip  to  flow  into  the  mould  during  the  casting  process. They will embed the Z Corp plaster printed  models  into  a  plaster  bat  and,  from  that,  make  a  silicone mould for casting. The moulds created are  good enough to take into full production, thus further  reducing  design  time  and  production  costs.  Denby  run their printers every day and now use 3D printing  for designs that will be made in cast iron, wood and  glass  for  kitchenware.  They  can  also  send  models  and STL files to their suppliers overseas, which can   9781474248679_txt_app.indb   106  9 26 17   3:51 PM   8  6  Peter Walters, ‘Flexible  actuator’, CFPR Labs.

If they can  get  ten  models  out  of  the  tank,  they  see  instantly  what  they  can  do  with  a  shape.  They  can  then  produce  the  same  shape  in  several  different  sizes  and with several different handles and spouts. They  can  also  respond  to  any  production  problems  very  quickly. one advantage for Denby is that the design  is  safe  because  they  have  the  information  backed  up  on  their  servers  –  compared  to  when  breaking   a  one-off  traditional  model  would  be  difficult  and  time consuming to recreate. Now they can just print  another  prototype.  Denby  still  use  the  traditional  craftspeople and their skills whenever they can and  really  benefit  from  their  knowledge,  but  now  3D  printing is an integral part of their design process in  addition to all of the old techniques. Sean o’Keefe,  Denby’s shape approval team leader, explains, ‘The  process  has  made  the  turnaround  from  concept  to  manufacture  much  faster.  Cutting  out  the  need  for  drawings, templates, forming tools and many other  parts of the previously long-winded process.’8  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   107  107  9 26 17   3:51 PM   10  David Huson at CFPR Labs,  3D-printed coffee cup and saucer.    David Huson.  The  approach  designers  take  to  create  objects  differs  very  little  to  any  of  the  other  creative  practitioners  I  have  interviewed  for  this  book.  The  only  difference  may  be  a  greater  tendency  to  use  standard  industry  proprietary  software  compared  to the fine artists or craftspeople. Fine artists and  craftspeople are often more prepared to use ‘open  source’ software or to write their own code to create  a particular effect, and they are not bothered with  the  need  to  communicate  with  others.  Designers  are also more likely to understand the need to pass  on files to third party, secure in the knowledge that  they can be instantly read, understood and printed  out.  I  would  argue  that  any  product  or  industrial  designer  under  the  age  of  forty  is  likely  to  have  been brought up using CAD programs and will have  a knowledge of CNC technology, so the leap to 3D  printing is a very small one. Most of the designers  who  use  the  technology  see  it  either  as  a  means  to  make  prototypes  for  a  client  or,  as  mentioned  above,  as  a  route  to  make  short  run  specialist  pieces.  However,  software  users,  especially  creative  software  users,  do  not  necessarily  approach   software in the way that the software houses assume  they will when they design. For example, when inkjet  printing was first introduced, at CFPR we ran some  workshops with a group of selected artists to test  how they used 2D print software. Rather than simply  taking a photograph and reproducing it, the artists  would be very pragmatic in creating an image, going  to great lengths, scribbling on something, scanning  it,  printing  it,  drawing  it  and  then  drawing  on  it  again, printing it again, then rescanning it, to build  a complex image for a project. Fundamentally, they  were working in ways never imagined by the creators  of  the  software.9  My  suspicion  that  artists  and  designers do not approach 3D software as intended  seems to have been borne out in my interviews.  Much  like  all  of  the  other  creative  users  I  have  interviewed,  designers  have  problems  with  the  limited  range  of  materials  available  and  the  material  quality  of  3D  printed  objects.  To  some  extent,  designers  have  tried  to  deal  with  this  by  post-processing  the  material  –  for  example,  Assa  Ashuach  both  dyes  and  polishes  the  nylon  parts  he produces. There is no doubt that the materials  are beginning to change, exemplified by the work of  the architect and designer Professor Neri oxman at   108  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   108  9 26 17   3:51 PM   MIT who has, from a visual perspective, moved the  technology one stage further. Her earlier works were  made at the MIT Media Lab using the new coloured  Connex  materials  from  objet,  entitled  ‘Imaginary  Beings, Mythologies of the Not Yet’ and exhibited  at  the  Pompidou  Centre  in  Paris  in  May  2012.  Her  latest work, Rottlace, is a family of masks designed  for Icelandic singer-songwriter Björk. Inspired by her  most recent album—Vulnicura—the Mediated Matter  Group explored themes associated with self-healing  and expressing ‘the face without a skin’. one of the  masks from the series was selected for Björk’s stage  performance at the Tokyo Miraikan Museum and 3D  printed by Stratasys using multi-material printing.10  Whilst it was previously possible to print in colour  with  machines  such  as  the  Z  Corp  650  and  the  very  latest  Stratasys  Connex,  multi-colour  material  has  pushed  the  abilities  to  design  and  3D  print  in  colour much further, offering a very different range of  material possibilities and the ability to embed colour  within a transparent support.  I had a free-flowing discussion around the issues  raised  with  the  designers  for  the  following  case  studies. The work of Assa Ashuach, Laura Alvarado  Vivian  Meller,  Dr  Lionel  Dean  and  Dr  Peter  Walters  seems  to  represent  the  current  direction  that  designers are taking in their use of 3D printing and  offers a diverse view of the field.  11  Neri oxman, ‘Leviathan 1’, ‘Armor Imaginary Beings’ series, 2012.

Assa  Ashuach  was  born  in  Israel,  in  1969.  He  has  a  BA  in  Product  Design  from  the  Betzalel  Academy  of  Art  and  Design  in  Jerusalem.  Just  after  graduating,  he  opened  a  design  studio  that  dealt  mainly  with  design  in  co-operation  with  architects.  In  2001  Assa  moved  to London, where he continued to work on his studio’s  projects  while  completing  an  MA  in  Design  Products  at  the  Royal  College  of  Art.  Upon  graduating  in  2003  his  work was bought by The Contemporary Art Society for the  Special  Collection  Scheme  in  London  2004.  During  the  London Design Festival and at the Frieze Art Fair in 2005– 2006, Assa’s new furniture and lights were featured in  the atrium of London Design Museum and in its exhibition  space Tank. He received the Design Museum and esmee  Fairbairn  Foundation  Award  and  the  ‘red  dot’  award  for  product  design  in  2006.  Assa  currently  leads  the  MA  Design Suite at London Metropolitan University.  In his personal practice Assa has harnessed the ability  to  print  multiply  jointed  objects  that  are  preassembled.  He  creates  objects  that  transcend  the  fact  that  they  are produced in 3D and has managed to make a range  of  designs  that  people  collect  and  find  desirable.  This  gives  a  fluidity  and  flexibility  to  the  objects  he  creates,   which transcend the inherently rigid qualities of the nylon  materials that he uses. He first encountered CAD during  his BA in Jerusalem:   —  We were lucky to have access to Alias Lightwave  on Silicone Graphics machines, and I thought it  was amazing to spin products on screen in 3D –  and at that time the software was mainly used by  the automotive and film industries, the dominant  technology was CNC, and surface modelling was  new. I remember even the staff were not used  to the technology; my teacher didn’t accept me  presenting virtual objects as prototypes. This was  the beginning of my use of digital technology.  He  embarked  on  his  research  career  in  the  1990s;  at  that  time  the  dominant  3D  printing  technology  was  stereolithography.  Assa  was  lucky  enough  to  be  sponsored by Autodesk® and eos while he was a student  at  the  Royal  College  of  Art:  ‘I  come  at  one  end  from  a  classic design background, so I love materials and I am  very excited by the opportunities offered by 3D printing.  I  don’t  see  it  as  a  different  hybrid  of  design  but  as  a  natural layer or as a natural new opportunity, if you like’.  110  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   110  9 26 17   3:51 PM   13  Assa Ashuach, dyed ‘Bon Bon’ light.   Assa Ashuach Studio.  In  order  to  create  his  virtual  models  for  3D  printing,  he  uses  three  main  software  packages.  Alias,  which  is  NURBS surface modelling software, primarily aimed at the  film and animation industries, Autodesk® 3ds Max®  then  3D Studio Max  and SolidWorks for the jobs that require  a harder engineering approach, with strict tolerances. He  says that over the years in his furniture, for example, with  its flowing curves, he has found that Alias software has  been very important to him in order to have the freedom  to design fluidly. When he has finalised the designs, he  will use a bureau such as 3T RPD or Metropolitan works  for the printing.  More than 90 per cent of Assa’s work is now 3D printed,  although most of the creative development, and therefore  product development, happens virtually – for the finished  designs,  it  is  probably  more  like  100  per  cent.  He  still  uses  the  traditional  prototyping  process  to  make  conventional prototypes, so he can examine things and  check  the  boundaries  of  objects  before  sending  them  through  the  conventional  routes  using  CNC  cutting  for  milling  prototypes.  He  also  uses  a  lot  of  moulding,  but  fundamentally  all  the  processes  begin  with  a  digital  file. At the same time he is mixing plastics and metals    —  and  experimenting  with  3D  printing.  With  the  larger,  more  sculptural  pieces,  he  also  uses  fibreglass  and  carbon fibre. I asked about his collaborations with larger  companies  like  Nike,  Samsung  and  Panasonic,  in  an  attempt  to  understand  how  we  can  move  into  different  ways of manufacturing: ‘At this moment, this is one of my  biggest challenges – how do we move this technology that  I am so familiar with – how do we use it to design better  products?  And  this  is  not  only  about  crazy  lattices  and  crazy geometries, but it is about offering better products  to the user’.  He is currently working very closely with eoS  the German  SLS machine manufacturer  because he believes that at  this point in time laser sintered nylon is the best product  for mass customisation:  Nylon is more predictable, more controllable.  It’s robust and easy to finish. If you remove the  cost element with nylon, we can already create  some good products, especially if you use post  processing, like vibro polishing and dye dipping.  The other product that is very good  but, again,  very expensive  is laser sintering of metal,   9781474248679_txt_app.indb   111  111  9 26 17   3:51 PM   precious gold, silver, titanium, stainless steel,  copper and simple alloys.  Assa  believes  metals  are  already  of  big  value  to  engineering,  but  for  consumer  markets  the  big  barrier  is cost. He believes this will change: ‘If you manage to  characterise  the  material  in  a  particular  way  you  can  analyse and predict and perfect those characteristics in  the  design,  you  are  able  to  do  things  a  different  way  –  thicknesses all sorts of things – its all very interesting!’  We then discussed how the characteristics of 3D printing  could  be  utilised  to  push  the  boundaries  of  design  thinking:   —  I would like to see digital forming as a new  design method. Because I am designing objects  that are in motion, they should be flexible in  some way – imagine if you want to bend things  – you don’t want them to crack, and even in the  virtual environment, when you shape and modify  things you really want nice beautiful poly flow  and lines of circulations – a bit like making DNA  when you want the baby to be healthy in some  way. Because we are designing the object – we  have to keep in mind that these objects will be  modified.   —  In  terms  of  software,  he  prefers  StudioMax  to  create  designs  that  keep  geometric  tessellation,  which  for  his  purposes  has  to  be  very  organic  and  natural  with  no  crude intersections, so it all flows together. He uses the   analogy of animation in gaming – in particular, the way the  face and the lifting of the face is programmed to convey  emotion  –  specifically,  the  modules  that  re-design  the  facial  expression  of  the  characters,  because  they  have  to make sure that when the face expresses, deforms and  speaks, it happens in a beautiful and natural way.  For  Assa,  the  barriers  to  3D  printing  are  the  material  characteristics,  or  lack  thereof:  ‘Primarily,  it’s  all  made  out  of  one  material  –  in  real  terms,  it’s  just  one  solid  block of material, which has some issues. In one way, it’s  a benefit; there’s no assembly.’  So  he  tries  to  make  everything  from  one  material  by  designing  and  using  the  natural  flexibility  of  the  nylon.  Right now, for example, he is designing a foldable chair  –  all  from  one  printed  object  –  with  a  gear  mechanism  inside:  So imagine you take [the chair] out of the  machine and in one movement you can open it  for the first time and sit on it immediately – so  in one way the potential is huge because you  don’t have people in China  for example  involved  in assembly, but this is also where sometimes  you say, ‘OK, but I need another material inside  of there too’, and it’s, ‘Oh, sorry, that’s not  possible!’  15  14  Assa Ashuach, Dyed Lemon Squeezers.

However, in essence, this is just  two main materials used together  a hard and soft variant  of the same material . objet cleverly use the software to  create a different range of material properties from hard  through to soft, rather than having to use a multiple set  of materials to create the different properties.  Assa  is  very  clear  about  how  to  view  the  current  hype  and  media  interest  surrounding  3D  printing.  He  uses  an analogy from his old university professor, Ron Arad,  to  illustrate  this:  ‘Be  careful  not  to  take  yourself  too  seriously.’ He often wonders if he is taking himself too  seriously:  He really believes in the concept of time: ‘If you spend all  your time on something and you believe in it and you are  passionate about it, you’ll gain a very good understanding  of  that  territory,  and  you’ll  become  an  expert’.  Assa  advocates investing time in things and always learning and  educating yourself. A good illustration of his argument is  that given two technicians producing the same design on  the same machine, we will get different results: ‘one will  talk to the machine in a different way and configure the  machine,  the  speed,  the  heat  and  the  laser  differently,  so everything is different – so 3D printing really is not as  we believe.’  Assa  believes  the  future  direction  for  3D  printing  lies  in  local  manufacturing  and  what  he  calls  ‘postcode  production’.   —   —  People are very excited by this concept of  materialisation and we are coming to this  with the urge to create, to fabricate [and] to  materialise and such, and I think we should also  make sure we are not overexcited. I think for  you and me it’s not ‘news’, and it’s funny that  now suddenly it is all happening around this  technology, and I keep asking myself – why? It’s  an ageing technology. How come only now is it  suddenly very ‘interesting’? It’s about how we  can gain the most benefit from this technology –  we should stay open to everything.  It is all about how the city changes over time,  local business, networking equidistant 3D  printers in a connected city. The machine  capacity is utilised to remove all the machines’  redundancy. Basically the ideal is the user  can walk round the corner to get the product  locally, turning the user into a partner and  helping producers capitalise on their redundant  production.  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   113  16  Assa Ashuach, ‘AI Light’.

Photograph: Laura Alvarado.  I first encountered the work of Laura Alvarado and Vivian  Meller in 2013 at the Museum of Art and Design  MAD ,  New York, as part of the the ‘out of Hand – Materialising  the Post Digital” exhibition  curated by Ron Labaco . I was  very  impressed  that  their  work  undertook  an  opposite  route  to  many  artists  who  try  to  accurately  scan  and  recreate their artefacts. Alvarado and Meller deliberately  use  the  limitations  and  inaccuracies  of  both  scanning  and printing to create an impression of the past that has  no basis in reality.  I wanted to stay there in Germany. So I enrolled  in a product design course, but I never really  concentrated on product design or jewellery  design. I really just tried everything out! So I don’t  know what I am – I’m closest to an experimental  designer, I suppose.  Laura  describes  her  professional  practice  as  ‘mainly  research  and  experimentation’.  When  asked  about  her  first encounters with 3D printing, Laura replied:  Laura  Alvarado  answered  my  questions  on  behalf  of  herself  and  Vivian  Meller.  However,  the  bulk  of  the  interview  is  personal  to  Laura.  I  asked  Laura  how  she  would  identify  her  personal  practice  and  her  creative  identity. She answered:   —  Well, it’s really funny that you ask me that now, as  I’m having a bit of an identity crisis and I think I  am something between an artist and a designer,  or an ‘idea maker’. I will settle on ‘idea maker’  for now. I originally studied industrial design in  Bogotá, Colombia. I didn’t like that because it  was too technical. Then I came to Germany, after  getting a place at the University of Dusseldorf. My  aim was to do an apprenticeship as a goldsmith  as I was very keen on making something with  my hands, but the state didn't allow me to do  this. I would have to study at a university level if    —  114  It was at University in Dusseldorf for Applied  Sciences and Arts around 2008–09. When the  tech was still very new, and I had always had  this crisis over whether I was a goldsmith, as all  the other students on my course already had  apprenticeships in goldsmithing, so I was always  looking for other courses that didn’t require  those highly technical skills, and there was this  one course by Christina Karababa, working  with a low tech 3D scanner, that I found very  experimental and playful and didn’t require those  traditional craft skills  i.e., in goldsmithing . So  that was the course I decided to do. And then  it was kind of like getting on a plane for a very  long journey because subsequently I have been  working ever since, but that course determined  what I do and how I think. That was the time   when I first started 3D printing and scanning .  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   114  9 26 17   3:52 PM   19  Laura Alvarado and Vivian Meller, Portrait me: Harajuka, Ceramic  White 2015.

I asked Laura about when she uses 3D printing in a piece  of  work  –  is  it  solely  created  in  3D  print  or  does  she  combine  it  with  more  traditional  technology?  She  said,  ‘Both. For me there has to be a mix of both, so that the  objects have a bit of soul. Also because I like 3D printing  and the way you can process the data beyond just the 3D  printing itself.’  I asked her which software she preferred to use and how  she has created what she has.  We work with low budget scanners – DAVID™  was the first hand-held scanner we used. We  found the process very poetic, and the hand  scanning became a whole performative thing and  then we got some sponsorship   Beta testing  from DAVID™. We used Rhino™ and Geomagic™  and we tried Blender™, too, but they were all a  bit too technical – Blender™, in particular, was  not so user friendly. Then we went on to 3D  printing on a first generation Z-Corp™ printer and  an FDM machine.   —  After the MAD exhibition, we got into a ceramics  project back at Dusseldorf collaborating with the  Hetjens German Ceramic Museum in Dusseldorf  and a German ceramic company to produce  high fired ceramic pieces – this was really hard,  especially getting the glaze to work. What’s also  nice about 3D printing is that you have this data   18  Laura Alvarado and Vivian Meller, Pre Scan model for Portrait me:  Harajuka, 2015. Photograph Laura Alvarado.  Laura’s  collaborator  Vivian  Meller  studied  Applied  Arts  at  the  University  of  Applied  Sciences  in  Dusseldorf,  Germany,  where  they  met.  It  is  interesting  to  note  that  both had previously trained as goldsmiths.   —  In regard to the proportion of her works that include 3D  printing,  Laura  answered:  ‘Well,  I  would  say  100  per  cent.  I  became  a  mother  three  years  ago,  so  my  work  has very much reduced as a result, but the collaboration  and project ‘Portrait Me’ I have with Vivian Meller is still  on-going. So that is what I invest most of my time in now.’  I wanted to investigate why Laura used 3D printing and  what qualities she thought it offered over other traditional  processes.   —  3D printing enables me to materialise the  thoughts and ambitions I had before but hadn’t  been able to realise until now. It also has  this technical advantage for mass production  and industry, but really I see it as a way of  materialising thoughts into objects that I couldn’t   9781474248679_txt_app.indb   115  115  9 26 17   3:52 PM   all  fall  apart  in  the  printing  if  they  were  not  connected  in  some  way,  even  if  the  print  bureau  would  accept  an  unclosed  net  file.  The  parts  have  to  be  joined  with  a  stitching  programme  such  as  Geomagic™.  A  very  high  degree of skill is needed in order to join the parts without  losing the integrity of the printed object. Laura expanded  further:   —  We tried Shapeways™ when they were a  relatively new company, and we liked the results  of the first batch of data we sent them – they  looked really good and we were really happy with  them. So then we sent them the exact same  batch of data and then they said no, because  they had all these failures in them, so then we  went round a few other companies and none of  them would print them either, due to the failures.  So we asked a friend who said we were probably  messing up the print room with our whole  printing with failure method, so then we started  working with Geomagic™ to try to overcome  some of the problems, and that still remains the  hardest part of the whole printing process.  I discussed with Laura how there is no perfect 3D printing  software for artists yet, such as Adobe’s Creative Suite™.  She argued that the whole 3D printing process is divided,  too, right from the scanning stage – if scanner software   20  Laura Alvarado and Vivian Meller, Portrait me: Muisca, from Native  American Series, 2015. Photograph: Laura Alvarado.  and you can print it in whatever material you  want and scale it to whatever scale, and that  gives you a lot of freedom to work in either a  small scale or make very big pieces. We also  tried laser sintering with nylon before we began  to work in ceramic. The biggest barrier for us  is the part of the 3D modelling process that  involves Geomagic™ We don’t close our 3D scan  nets – we like to stay true to the first impression  and leave them open, so the mesh has a lot of  failures. But in order to actually print the design  it has to be ‘failure free’ or watertight, and this  makes the process really difficult for us because  the tools needed to complete the project are very  expensive and very complicated. So if you don’t  work in the traditional way by building the perfect  watertight volume with closed mesh holes, then  the process can be very difficult.  I  would  argue  that  Laura  understates  the  problems  involved in creating these low resolution artworks. She is  correct that the scans that are all separate pieces would   21  Laura Alvarado and Vivian Meller, Portrait me: Hip Hopper, from Urban  Tribes Series, 2015.

We  started  to  debate  the  question  of  whether,  as  an  artist,  Laura  felt  that  she  was  giving  up  her  own  craft  skills  or  that  3D  printing  had  its  own  craft  sensibility.  Laura’s view was ‘it definitely has its own craft and skill  but you don’t have to give up one for the other. I believe  you can cleverly bind them together rather than give up  one for the other.’  I  tried  to  summarise  her  views  with  the  following  statement:  ‘The  work  begins  as  an  imitation  of  reality  and  then  progresses  so  that  the  imitation  deteriorates  and  deteriorates  until  it  creates  its  own  “reality  of  a  reality”.’ Laura responded: ‘Yes, absolutely. For example,  the leaves we had done were all perfect, because they  were  imperfect.  And  now  we  don’t  like  them.  We  want  to  include  all  those  failures  in  this  supposedly  perfect  technology; we want to show them. For example, Skype™  didn’t really work when it first came out, and now it’s a  global success . . .’ She went on to say:   —  We  went  on  to  discuss  my  view  that  Laura  and  Vivian  have  cleverly  used  the  aspect  of  diminishing  quality  of  the  scan  and  the  subsequent  deterioration  of  the  final  piece. I found this really interesting, both in the process  itself  and  in  the  final  piece  produced.  Laura  observed,  ‘It’s really interesting you bring up that aspect of our work  as  all  the  print  bureaus  and  our  academic  supervisors  were trying to make our work “perfect” and kept on giving  us tips on how we can close the gaps etc., and we were  like “no no no!”’  I’m so pleased that you see this, as we so often  have to explain why the pieces look like they do,  but that’s also why we started with the paper  pieces where we fool the scanner just by putting  white objects on our heads, in a very immature  way, to resemble hair and make it therefore  scannable. Early in our studies at Dusseldorf, we  formed a group called ‘Formativ’, and this all ties in  with the ‘Formativ Manifesto’, which was written at  the beginning of our digital imaging experiments.  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   117  117  9 26 17   3:53 PM   I  have  included  the  Manifesto  supplied  by  Laura,  as  I  believe  it  summarises  much  of  their  approach  to  their  practice and also is a good basis for much of the approach  to 3D printing and scanning that artists have taken in the  last three years since I wrote the first edition of this book.  Formativ Manifesto  1  The different interplay between experimental design   2  The combination of low and high tech,   experimentation with digital imaging and design tools 3  The integration of forms and objects through process   tools  iteration  4  Systematic experimentation with the dysfunctional   use of software and hardware tools  5  The conscious use of errors as an integral part of the    —  design process  6  The innovative use of scanning design methods for   morphing and the transformation of objects  7  experimentation, visualisation and documentation   of visual design processes as an element of holistic  design processes  Having  been  struck  by  the  quality  of  the  work  by  Laura  and  Vivian  in  the  ‘out  of  Hand’  exhibition,  I  wanted  to  know how the curator Ron Labaco had highlighted their  work for inclusion in the show. Laura’s reply gives some  insight into how such exhibitions are put together:  pieces at the time that were independent of  research we were doing at the university. Ron  thought it might be nice to make something  special just for the American public. So we  thought either ‘Native Americans’ or ‘Urban  Tribes’ based on the different ‘scenes’ in New  York, such as Punks, Hip Hop etc., and Ron said,  ‘OK. Great – please do both of those’! Although  it was a lot of work, it was really good for us  because then we had to do it and we produced  three pieces for each series.  To  conclude  the  interview  I  asked  where  she  saw  the  future of 3D printing. Laura replied:  I think it will revolutionise industry – medicine,  for example – and a 3D printer will become like a  digital camera is now. Ordinary people  i.e., non- technical and non-designers  will start to print  much more in 3D print, for furniture, components  etc., but there has to be a limit, regarding  copyrights, quality of end products etc. So it will  accelerate processes but diminish quality.  Well, it’s a long story – Vivian and I began our  collaboration during an artist in residence  provided by Dutch jewellery artist Ted Noten,  who offered a space to young artists and  craftspeople in a former whore house as part of  a big Amsterdam project called RedLightDesign,  aimed at cleaning up the image of the Red Light  District. We named our project 'Portrait me' and  the first pieces got selected to be part of a big  jewellery show with an international reputation  in Munich. There we met Ursula Neumann, a  jewellery curator at MAD.  I learned about Ursula Neumann because I  had already exhibited at MAD with one of my  first 3D printing projects as part of a jewellery  show called ‘Think Twice – New Latin American  Jewellery’. Vivian and I decided to send Ursula  a flier of ‘Portrait me’. She liked the project and  suggested we go into the 3D exhibition at MAD.  Then Ron Labaco contacted us to arrange it a  few weeks later. I think we only had about three    —   —  118  24  Pre Scan model for Portrait me: Muisca, from Native Americans  Series, 2015.

Lionel defines himself as a ‘product artist’ and believes  he was amongst the earliest designers using 3D printing  in a creative environment. In 2002–2003 he undertook a  design residency in rapid prototyping. Previously he had  used  rapid  prototyping  in  2002  for  a  european  design  competition. Lionel describes the design process of the  first 3D printed artwork he made:   —  The piece itself was destined to be injection  moulded, and I had to make a prototype of it;  it was a clear piece with lots of facets and the  only way to realistically do that was by RP. The  process used was stereo lithography  SLA  and,   through a university contact who knew someone  at 3D Systems, they helped us out with the piece.  It was getting that prototype part that was the  revelation moment – suddenly opening a box  and getting your fully finished design through  the post – that was an amazing thing. So then I  thought, you’ve got to be able to do this for real  products, and how can you justify doing that?  Then I got the opportunity to pitch for the design  residency, which I did based on the idea that we’d  use this process to create an extended series of  one-offs and find some route between homemade  craft practice and industrial production.  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   119  119  9 26 17   3:53 PM   Lionel has an interesting, and subtly different view, in terms  of the relation between materials and making. He argues:  satisfying experience as a designer because it is  a ‘real’ material.   —  You almost separate the creation of form  from the making of the form. You do have to  understand the processes and the materials to  get the best out of the process, depending on  what processes you are using – particularly when  you get into the metals, it is really important to  understand the process, less so with plastic.  But I think you can separate the two a little bit,  in a way that you really can’t making things  physically. Using metal is much more of a   He  goes  on  to  argue  that  the  technology  has  reached  the stage that although it is capable of making real world  products,  there  are  still  some  issues  –  for  example,  ‘lighting kind of works because you don’t touch lighting.  It hangs there and looks pretty, but anything that involves  handling the plastic really isn’t up to it’. He qualifies: ‘It’s  a temporary restriction, and things have got a lot better.  The plastic itself has got a lot better, the resolution of the  SLS has got a lot better, there are more options in the  plastic materials now’.  26  Lionel Dean, ‘Holy Ghost’.   Lionel Dean.  120  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   120  9 26 17   3:53 PM   Lionel gives the example of Alumide™  a 50 50 powder  mix of aluminium and polyamide  for SLS, available from  Shapeways™:  ‘That’s  a  really  pretty  material.  I’ve  used  it in jewellery and tumbled it to polish the surface, and it  has a real quality to it that the plastic on its own doesn’t  have’.  quite reluctant to involve you in the process.  Since then I have built a good relationship with  some bureaus, like 3TRPD, with whom I have  worked very closely on the process and that has  been quite a big shift in my understanding of the  process and the results I’ve got from it.  Unlike  many  designers  who  cite  natural  forms  as  their  inspiration  for  creating  3D  artworks  that  are  then  generated through digital algorithms, Lionel approaches  this  much  more  directly  and  combines  natural  forms  in  a  very  literal  sense  –  for  example,  his  elegant  piece  ‘Blatella’, which he describes as a floor pendant and wall  sconce. ‘Literally’ is made up of a swarm of 3D-rendered  insects:  ‘A  crowd  of  insects  swarms  around  the  light  source, drawn by the glow; their bodies are bright with a  translucent purity that belies associations with filth and  squalor’.   —  Lionel  also  combines  these  more  direct  renderings  of  natural forms with chairs such as his ‘Holy Ghost’ chair,  made in 2010. Lionel articulates how his creative practice  is now exclusively 3D printed. However, in common with  the most of the designers I have interviewed, the majority  of Lionel’s work is printed by a 3D bureau service such  as iMaterialise™ or 3TRPD. He is based at De Montfort  University, where he has access to an eoS Formiga P100  SLS machine. Having access to this machine has given  him  good  practical  knowledge  and  hands-on  experience  putting the build onto a machine, which, in turn, gives him  a better understanding of the problems that can occur in  the transcription from software through to actual build.  Lionel  feels  that  understanding  and  knowing  the  machine gives him an advantage when sending files for  manufacture  to  a  bureau  service.  He  articulates  how  bureaus have evolved from when he started to use them.  I have covered Lionel’s views on bureaus because he is  a long-term user of these services, and most of the other  interviewees  either  print  for  themselves  or  do  not  have  the same close relationship Lionel has when printing his  work through a third party:   —  Initially the bureau culture was, ‘We will take the  file off you’, and they didn’t want to get into a  further discussion about why something wouldn’t  work – it just ‘didn’t’. If possible, they would  change it for you and charge you, because that’s  part of the added value they bring to it – they  aren’t just packing the machine, they are solving  the problems, if you like. Generally bureaus were   He shares my own views about how artists and designers  currently approach 3D printing and how this approach is  reflected  in  the  development  cycle  that  the  technology  has reached:  Sometimes you can tell if an object is 3D  printed because you can’t tell how it can have  been made any other way, but if it looks like  it’s 3D printed in a not so good way, then it is  not as successful. There has been a kind of  honeymoon period where designers and artists  have got attention simply because they are  using 3D printing – it’s, ‘Wow, isn’t this great!’  And I am not being disparaging about anyone  else, and I include my work here to a certain  extent, but now we have to become a little more  sophisticated because you are not going to get  a free ride just because the technology is new.  You’ve got to be a little more discerning and say  it’s a premium process and are you using it to  its full capabilities? I think at the moment, the  material aspects lag behind its capabilities and  at some point that will change.  Both of these statements bear out the general views that  occur throughout this book – that the biggest constraint  for 3D printing is the lack of material qualities and options.  Lionel  uses  a  variety  of  different  software  packages,  primarily  NURBS  surface  modellers,  for  example  Alias  Studio Tools™ because of his background as a product  designer. He also uses solid modellers to get a decent  STL  output.  He  is  increasingly  using  polygon  modellers  as well, ‘which, as designers, we used to think were a bit  dirty, but now we are getting a little more into because of  the flexibility that brings’.  our discussion led to the problems that Lionel encounters  with workflow in the software. This is one of the clearest  articulations  of  the  common  problem  encountered  by  most of the case study individuals included in this volume:   —  I don’t think the software houses help us in that  they are all trying to ‘hook you in’. This thing  called workflow – they try to tell you the industry   9781474248679_txt_app.indb   121  121  9 26 17   3:53 PM   works in this particular way and it doesn’t really  suit. Particularly if you have a hybrid practice  where you are on the fringes of craft, art and  design, it really doesn’t help you. If you are  an industrial designer, designing the sorts of  products they expect, then they are fine. You  seem to spend so much of your time finding  ‘work-arounds’ for problems. Particularly dealing  with complex designs that push the software and  the computational power. It’s as if almost half  your time is spent fixing the problems rather than  actually working on the design, which I guess  is part of the design process in itself, but you  always feel if you had infinite resources those  wouldn’t be the issues.   —  When  considering  further  barriers  towards  the  wider  uptake  of  3D  printing,  Lionel  considers  it  essential  to  articulate  why  this  process  is  not  just  ‘plug  and  play’,  which is the pre-conception many people have when they  first  encounter  the  technology.  For  example,  additional  software is needed to complete the transcription of the  file from conception to print; you may need to use an STL  repair tool such as Geomagic™  also Magics or Netfabb   to sort out or repair the file, which he uses for fixing STLs.  In 2013 Geomagic™ retailed at about £3000 with annual   rental charge for a commercial licence, and Lionel argues  that kind of price just for a filter for STLs is a problem.  Furthermore, he argues, the overall cost of the process is  huge – even when mitigated by using a bureau service, the  costs can easily soar, and all parties are aware that every  build comes with significant cost in time and materials:  When I first started working with Materialise  MGX™ I thought – this is brilliant, here is this  huge bureau I am working for and we will be  able to turn out objects every day and just keep  refining them until we get it right! But they really  didn’t want to commit to a build until the design  was absolutely right, which fascinated me,  because they wanted to use it for commercial  bureau work and space was always a premium  even though it had huge capacity. And it’s the  same now working myself, when I have to build  something, it’s quite a commitment; it has to be  right. So for visualisation, using a budget process  such as desktop FDM filament printing is fine. I  find if I am making one of the more expensive,  big pieces that are going to cost £1000 to  £2000 each, it’s got to be right first time and  I’ve got to be able to sell it. So I need to cheaply  visualise it first.  27  Lionel Dean, orbis 3D printed gold ring made in collaboration with Cookson Gold, 2015  122  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   122  9 26 17   3:53 PM   28  Lionel Dean, ‘Blatella’.   Lionel Dean.  In Lionel’s view, the results from a bureau can depend  on  the  parameters  they  use;  you  can  speed  things  up  and change the resolution, but it depends on what those  results are giving you. It also depends very much on your  set up – for example, with the metals, it is crucial how  you set files up because of the huge cost and the time  needed to clean the finished object. The titanium is an  aerospace grade that is incredibly hard, but with plastics  it doesn’t really matter so much. He further qualifies the  need to collaborate with and understand the needs of a  particular bureau:   —  It was the case, particularly in the early days  of 3D printing metals, there was quite a big  difference in terms of finish and some bureaus  would handle fine geometries better than others  but I think increasingly it’s not such an issue.  And with plastics there is very little difference in   the sintering processes. I am familiar with one  process, but I have had parts from other bureaus  who use a different process, and pretty much it’s  the same.  He  concludes  with  his  views  on  bureau  services  and  metal printing. He uses both direct metal laser sintering   DMLS   machines  –  the  eoS  system,  and  the  machine  that was made by MTT, but is now owned by Renishaw.  In Lionel’s opinion, eoS is further ahead in development  than MTT, and Lionel thinks it will be interesting to see  what will happen now that Renishaw have taken over MTT  because they have backing and resources that MTT didn’t  have before.  I  wanted  to  explore  Lionel’s  views  as  to  whether,  as  a  designer,  he  felt  he  had  given  up  any  of  his  traditional  skills to use 3D printing:  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   123  123  9 26 17   3:53 PM   29  Lionel Dean, ‘Blatella’.   Lionel Dean.   —  Yes – drawing. I used to teach drawing and I  don’t draw at all now because you end up with  a translation between a sketch that you then  move onto screen and there isn’t any point.  Instead you just start working straight on screen.  I might jot something down so I remember  it or to try and organise my thoughts but not  really to develop the form in the way I would  have done originally. Considering I still teach  undergraduates and encourage them to draw  everyday, I am quite uncomfortable saying that!  The same with making models. I clean up models  but not by sculpting in the way I would have  before. I used to do a lot of clay work and I just  don’t do that any more, and that’s a skill that if  you don’t practice it all the time you will lose.  create  software  that  is  intuitive.  However,  he  does  not  believe that haptics actually help:  Haptics don’t solve the problem, as first you  have to learn the software. That’s a pain barrier  you have to go through; that’s kind of saying,  ‘You artists, you won’t understand this so we  are giving you this device to find a way around  it because you can’t cope with the software’.  We can cope with the software; we don’t need  a device. There is a place for it but not as the  primary method for developing a form. It’s almost  like it’s an additional tool, but there are some  things where if you had the model physically in  front of you, it’s not a question of constructing,  you would get some filler or clay and just  smooth it in with your thumb. And it’s that little  motion if you like, that is very hard to recreate  constructing things in 3D. If you try modelling  something from scratch with haptics, it is so  difficult because you don’t have the references.  Lionel  also  has  clear  views  on  the  abilities  and  shortcomings of haptic arms. Haptics are a 3D technology  solution to the touch and feel that is missing when using  a  mouse  to  sculpt  an  object  and  were  an  attempt  to    —  124  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   124  9 26 17   3:53 PM   In terms of the future for the technology, Lionel believes  it’s going to be pervasive:   —  If we look at what has happened in 2D design,  with things like Photoshop, but also the  availability of printing – we all print documents.  When I was a lad, having a printed brochure  was a major thing. You had to send it off to  a printer – and now you just print it on your  desktop. I think we will have our own 3D printers,  but the high-end print will always be a bureau  service because you will always be chasing  the technology. So you will get more and more  printers at home, but there will always be better  ones in bureaus, certainly in the medium term.  So we will be printing things ourselves and we  will be going to places like Shapeways™ or  commercial bureaus; [there are] almost three   levels to it. I do think a lot of people will have a  home printer, but it will be very much a plaything.  I don’t know if this model of ‘something will  break down in your house and you print off a  spare part’ will happen very quickly – maybe  eventually.  He concludes by commenting on students’ desire to use  a new technology just because it’s new.   —  In terms of art and design practice, it is alarming  the speed with which it  3D printing  has taken  off. A couple of desktop millers have come in,  and a laser cutter, and students now can’t cut  things on a band saw. They will queue waiting for  the laser cutter because it gives them a cleaner  cut. And very often it’s just a few right angles –  which is like using a hammer to crack a nut.  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   125  30  Lionel Dean, ‘entropia’  section.

Peter  Walters.  31  126  Peter is currently based at the Centre for Fine Print Research  at  the  University  of  the  West  of  england  in  Bristol.  He  trained and worked as an industrial designer in Sheffield,  which gave him a solid grounding and understanding of  technology within a visual arts context. Before taking his  PhD,  Peter  worked  for  a  design  consultancy  called  the  Advanced Product Development Centre, a spin-out Design  Group  from  Sheffield  Hallam  University.  From  Peter’s  perspective,  industrial  design  is  significant  in  that  it  brings together form and function as a creative discipline  that marries the visual sensibilities of the visual arts with  technology.  As  an  industrial  designer,  Peter  developed  the  skills  necessary  to  work  with  3D  printing  as  a  tool  and a medium, and he learned 3D computer-aided design   CAD  and therefore also learnt CAM, laser cutting and 3D  printing technologies because they were the tools of the  trade. In the last five years Peter has been working as a  research fellow in the visual arts, in a role that allows him  to continue to use his design skills and sensibilities, but  in a broader range of creative disciplines.  Peter describes his personal practice as ‘the creative use  of technology’. He has always been fascinated by making  and  machines,  and  that  which  is  technically  possible  to make. Peter tries to express this in his practice. He  says,  ‘I  also  enjoy  collaborating  with  people  in  other  disciplines, to create work which is only possible through  those collaborations  i.e., it could not exist if the practice  was contained within a single discipline . So I work with  a broad range of people and disciplines from fine art to  engineers and robotics’.  Peter  collaborated  with  the  artist  Katie  Davies  on  a  sculptural  piece  that  explored  how  data  could  be  translated from one medium to another. Peter and Katie  created  a  3D  graph,  using  data  corresponding  to  the  radiation beam from a pulsar, a high-speed spinning star.  This graph formed the basis of the shape of a 3D-printed  sculpture. The pulsar sculpture, ‘Vela’, was exhibited at  an  exhibition  in  Boston,  Massachusetts,  called  ‘Mixed  Signals’, curated by Boston Cyber Arts.  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   126  9 26 17   3:53 PM   32  33  34  In  another  project,  Peter  investigated  applications  for  smart  “artificial  muscle”  materials.  He  employed  3D  printing to create tentacle-like structures in a soft, rubber- like material using the objet Geometries 3D printer. The  structures  include  internal  cavities  into  which  shape  memory  alloy  artificial  muscles  were  introduced.  When  stimulated  by  an  electric  current,  the  artificial  muscles  contract,  causing  the  tentacle  structure  to  move  in  a  lifelike  way.  In  collaboration  with  puppet  designer  and  roboticist David McGoran, Peter created the tentacle-like  active  structures  and  a  flexible  controller,  which  allows  tentacles to be ‘puppeteered’.  Peter first used 3D printing in 1999 when he was a final  year undergraduate student. He designed a clothes peg for  keeping socks in pairs in the washing machine using stereo  lithography to make a prototype model. This was painted  so it looked just like the real item. Peter was one of the  first undergraduate students at Sheffield Hallam to use 3D  printing. The 3D printer, a 3D Systems stereolithography  machine, was based at the regional development agency  in Rotherham. Almost 100 per cent of Peter’s work is now  3D printed. He says, ‘I am very lucky to have access to first- class facilities, which means I have been able to develop  skills and understanding of 3D printing as a process and  the range of materials that are possible’.  35  36  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   127  127  9 26 17   3:54 PM   In the workshop we have Objet, Z Corp and  a RapMan that I have converted for printing  pastes, including ceramics and foodstuffs.  Contrary  to  what  most  people  have  said  regarding  the  barrier of learning software, Peter had a slightly different  take. He said that he is interested in why more people do  not want to learn the software! It is actually not as difficult  as people might think and compared to say, life drawing  or learning to play the piano, it is ‘easy’. Peter went on  to articulate that in his experience of people learning the  software, the first week or two can be tough, with a steep  learning  curve,  but  after  that  it  becomes  easier  to  the  point where the interface and tools are second nature to  the experienced user.  In  light  of  Peter’s  comments,  I  myself  wonder  whether  this reluctance to learning the software is akin to most  people’s  relationship  with  maths,  where  the  perception  of difficulty is due to fear rather than the actuality. I also  asked Peter whether users of the technology are giving up  traditional craft skills or whether 3D printing has its own  craft sensibility. Peter’s view on this:   —  To begin with, 3D printing does not replace  the range and breadth of traditional tools,  materials and technologies, which are still  widely used by artists, designers, engineers  and manufacturers. 3D printing is not a single  process; rather [it] offers a range of materials  and fabrication technologies that have many  attractive advantages, but these advantages  are not replacements for traditional tools and  techniques. The areas in which 3D printing is  viable as a manufacturing route are currently  limited to high cost, one-off and small batch  production, such as jewellery and dental.  3D printing really comes into its own as a  prototyping tool for creative artists, designers  and engineers. It allows design ideas to be tested  in the physical world and designers can rapidly  iterate ideas and identify and resolve problems  at an early stage in the creative process.  He  uses  3D  printing  because  it  is  relatively  quick  and  easy compared to making things by hand, and it allows  him  to  do  things  that  would  be  impossible  by  other  means. Having said that, he is no longer interested in the  novelty of being able to make impossible shapes. Peter  articulates that it is a phase that most people go through  with the technology – and naturally so – take, for example  the  ubiquitous  Klein  bottle.  The  3D  printing  process  allows  him  to  create  functional  parts  which,  whilst  not  impossible,  would  have  been  terribly  difficult  to  make  and  would  have  required  complex  multi-cavity  moulds.  However, these parts are 3D printed in soft material in  a  few  hours,  so  he  can  try  the  design  out  very  quickly  and make any necessary modifications that are needed  to make the device work.  In  response  to  being  asked  whether  he  combines  3D  printing with other processes, Peter replied, ‘Sometimes  I  use  3D  printing  directly  but  at  other  times  it  is  both  necessary and desirable to transform a design into other  materials,  and  here  I  have  used  3D  printing  to  make  moulds – for example, to cast silicone rubber because a  design required the properties of silicone, which were not  available in a 3D-printed material’.  Peter  uses  different  software  depending  on  the  job  in  hand.  He  first  learnt  how  to  3D  model  in  1993,  using  AutoCAD  Release  12,  since  then  he  has  used  a  range  of  CAD  programs  including  Rhino,  Pro-engineer  and  SolidWorks.  These  days  he  favours  Rhino  most  of  all  because he has been using it for a number of years and  can treat it like a sketch book. It is very quick to model  things up, but it does have limitations and so, sometimes,  he  has  to  transfer  between  software  –  for  example,  he  may have to move from Rhino to SolidWorks to shell a  part in order to give it a wall thickness. It is worth noting,  however, that in the early stages of a project Peter still  uses pencil and paper and plasticine to capture the first  ideas prior to working them up in CAD.  In terms of the hardware he uses, Peter explained:  Most of all I use Objet because of part quality  and range of materials. I am particularly fond  of the Tango™ range of rubber-like materials.  These have allowed me to develop my research  and creative practice in soft robotics. I also like  to use Z Corp for multi-colour printing and have  often sent parts to be made by iMaterialise™  in laser sintered nylon  see ‘Vela Pulse’  which  offers strength and an excellent surface finish.    —  128  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   128  9 26 17   3:54 PM   37  38  37  Peter Walters, 3D-printed coffee cup and beaker.   Peter Walters.  38  Peter Walters, ‘3D-Printed Bodies’, 2008.   Peter Walters.  A current limitation of 3D printing – in particular the low-  to medium-cost technologies – is the range of materials  that are available. When one considers the rich range of  everyday materials found in any home and the range of  aesthetic and functional affordances of these materials,  3D  printing  has  a  long  way  to  go.  The  focus  for  future  development  in  3D  printing  must  therefore  lie  in  the  development  of  a  wider  and  more  attractive  range  of  materials. This is not a simple problem to solve because  the fabrication technologies of 3D printing, such as inkjet,  powder deposition, laser fusing and so on, significantly  restrict the range of materials that can be used.  Nevertheless,  if  we  consider  how  far  the  technologies  have  come  in  the  relatively  short  time  that  they  have  existed  i.e., since the first machine in 1984 , in the next  twenty  to  thirty  years  we  can  expect  to  see  significant  developments  and  exciting  times  ahead  for  3D  printing   as a medium for visual artists and designers as well as  engineers,  medical  technologists  and  even  home  and  educational users.  Whilst  each  of  the  case  studies  in  this  chapter  are  designers,  they  each  comment  on  the  process  of  3D  printing  and  use  the  technology  in  very  different  ways.  Alvarado and Meller’s work is more a commentary on the  deficiencies of the process of both scanning and printing  in order to create a representation of a false reality that  never existed. Ashuach has always pushed the boundaries  of  what  he  can  obtain  from  the  process,  whilst  being  aware of commercial and production design constraints  that make for elegant solutions. Dean is very much about  using the technology and referencing what the theory may  mean  in  visual  terms,  both  literally  and  metaphorically,  whilst Walters applies an industrial design sensibility to  problem solving in order to extend a research philosophy.  1  3D Printing News  2012 , ‘Automotive  Components Achieve Pole Position with  Rapid Prototyping’, 23 July.

In tandem,  the low-cost 3D print technology has changed exponentially. In 2013 the  only cheap machines that were available were all plastic hot melt extrusion  FDM machines. Most of those machines were difficult to use because of  open-source software that required infinite patience and a steep learning  curve.  Received  industry  wisdom  reckoned  that  over  half  the  machines  purchased were never used. Recently there has been a proliferation of new  types  of  machines,  as  patents  from  the  early  1980s  have  lapsed.  They  include stereolithographic, photo-initiation, three legged delta robots and a  whole raft of new materials for FDM extrusion, including flexible PeT, wood,  low  melt  metals  and  even  plastic  made  from  mushrooms,1  Dutch  artist  eric Klarenbeek has created a series of artworks and even a chair from  mycelium fungus.  In 2016 consumer 3D printing completely dropped off  the Gartner emerging Technology Hype curve. It was  headed towards the trough of disillusionment, having  passed  through  the  peak  of  inflated  expectations.2  Industrial enterprise 3D printing, however, has risen  to the slope of enlightenment. The outcome of this  means that the mainstream press has begun to run   more sensible stories, although most of the reported  advances  for  medicine  and  prosthetics  tend  to  be  over-claimed and spun.  For  a  long  time  the  publicity  in  the  mainstream  press was about the disruptive potential of this new  technology. For several years the popular perception  was  that  soon,  at  the  press  of  a  button,  anybody   130  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   130  9 26 17   3:54 PM   would  be  able  to  print  anything  from  a  broken  part  to  a  fully  functional  gun  from  the  comfort  of  their  own  home.3  This  is  and  was  patently  not  true,  but  in this chapter we need to deal with how that public  perception  impacts  the  broader  visual  arts  as  a  discipline. The easiest way to examine this is to look  at those sections of the creative arts that have the  biggest audience profile. In the previous version of this  volume,  I  covered  fashion,  animation,  hackspaces,  FabLabs and makerspaces all in the same chapter.  For  this  edition,  it  makes  sense  to  split  those  and  confine  the  popular  culture  of  3D  print,  such  as  hackspaces, FabLabs, makerspaces and the domain  of research for the visual arts to its own chapter.  To  place  this  in  context  and  to  articulate  some  of  those  popular  misconceptions,  I  will  begin  by  reflecting  upon  examples  from  current  literature  about  3D  printing  that  have  reached  a  wide  public  audience and cite some examples of popular press  publicity. Having reflected on the most public aspects  of 3D printing in the visual arts, we also need to deal  with where the technology might go in the future. In  order to make any sort of future prediction, we have  to  begin  with  some  case  studies  dealing  with  the  areas of cutting-edge research currently taking place  in relation to the visual arts.  To  begin  with  public  perception,  two  stories  written in 2008 and 2009 are still astute commentary  on the growth and influence of the 3D printer. These  are  Makers  by  Cory  Doctrow4  and  ‘Kiosk’  by  Bruce  Sterling.5  Whilst  ‘Kiosk’  presents  a  dystopian  view  of the future, it has one distinct truth and advantage  over  much  of  the  other  literature:  It  presents  a  view of 3D printing that is entirely black! Not just in  outlook  but  also  in  its  physical  presence.  Sterling  presents us with the ‘Henry Ford’ view of the future  – to paraphrase, you can have anything you wish for,  as long as its black – in this instance, in black carbon  nano-tubes.  I  would  argue  this  is  very  close  to  the  current view of what the future may hold for 3D print,  in  that  it  clearly  demonstrates  its  limitations  and  then makes a feature of those very limitations  i.e.,  the current ability to only print in a single material .  To qualify a single material, I am not including here  different  colours  nor  hard  and  soft  versions  of  the  same material, and it is still not possible to print a  combination of metal and plastic concurrently.  Makers covers the rise of a geek culture using 3D  printing to create alternative models of business that  are  not  constrained  by  the  traditional  big-business  model. Whilst it describes these alternatives very well,  and much of what is described may well come to pass  in some form in the near future, one of the problems  the book generates, in tandem with the image of 3D  printing  presented  by  the  general  press  coverage,  is  an expectation that these new processes are capable  of  anything  and  all  objects  can  ‘just  be  printed’.  In  Makers,  Doctrow  espouses  the  ability  to  print  a  complete  fairground,  all  sorts  of  functional  objects  and even guns. In addition, it assumes the machines  are easy to operate and maintain, with the ability to  just  leave  them  overnight  to  make  everything!  The  most interesting aspect of the book is its exposition  of completely new models of business trading – which  may be the closest description of how business trading  will work in the future. The reality, of course, is that in  real terms all of these 3D processes are very limited  in what they can actually achieve. In the main, they lay  down a coil of liquid or a layer of powder that has to  be glued to the layer above and then dried. To return  to the age-old problem, ignored throughout Doctrow’s  book, anything that has to be glued to the layer above  is by its very nature going to be crude and in a single  material.  Apart  from  some  of  the  metal  sintering  processes,  perhaps,  there  is  a  very  long  way  to  go  before  we  can  create  objects  that  are  really  useful.  Most of the objects currently made are designed to fit  the limitations of the process and, to my knowledge,  there  is  no  machine  yet  that  will  lay  down  multiple  different  types  of  material  and  nothing  that  provides  high-quality  printing  in  combinations  of  everyday  materials such as metals, glass, ceramics, wood etc.  The ‘Holy Grail’ in terms of 3D printing is to be able to  print in multiple materials simultaneously, as very few  traditionally manufactured objects are produced from a  single material. Currently, the nearest is the Stratasys  J750 machine, which will lay down both hard and a soft  photo polymeric material in full colour, but has none of  the material and aesthetic qualities that are necessary  to make the technology universal.  There  is  a  similar  problem  in  the  mainstream  press,  who  primarily  follow  each  other  in  reporting  developments.  Between  2012  and  2014  the  mainstream press and television covered 3D printing   9781474248679_txt_app.indb   131  131  9 26 17   3:54 PM   1  eADS, ‘Airbike’ White Nylon Bike,  2011. entirely printed by laser sintered  nylon.   eADS.  including   extensively,  the  Sunday  Times,6  The  Economist,7  The  Guardian,8  Forbes  Magazine,9  and  TV programmes such as Newsnight,10 QI11 and Have  I Got News For You?12 However, the majority of this  coverage was mainly drawn from the fairly simplistic  view that virtually any object can now be printed in  3D.  More  recently  there  are,  however,  some  very  helpful examples that have received broad coverage:     The  FSTe  250  listed  company  Renishaw,  who   are  manufacturers  of  the  RemAM  series  of  metal  powder  fusion  technology  3D  printers,  has recently collaborated with empire Cycles to  create a fully 3D-printed titanium bicycle frame.  At this point the cost to make a single frame  would be around £20,000  $26,000 , but this  will  get  cheaper  as  the  technology  continues  to progress. The frame has been tested to six  times the normal test standard and creates a  weight saving of 33 per cent.13     Ge  Aviation,  who  make  aircraft  engines,  in   2016  have  created  the  first  3D-printed  parts  in  an  aircraft  engine.  each  of  the  new  CFM  engines,  produced  jointly  by  Ge  and  its  long-  time partner, Snecma  SAFRAN  of France, will  have  nineteen  3D-printed  fuel  nozzles  in  the  combustion  system  that  could  not  be  made  any  other  way.  The  benefits  of  printing  these  parts are numerous. They are lighter in weight  – 25 per cent lighter than the predecessor part.  Simpler design – the number of parts used to  make the nozzle will be reduced from eighteen  to one. They were also able to create new design  features – more intricate cooling pathways and  support ligaments will result in five times higher  durability versus conventional manufacturing.14  Much of the press coverage concerning low-cost  printers  has  now  expanded  beyond  the  early  fused  deposition  modelling  machines   FDM   and  now  primarily  covers  machines  that  are  sold  for  below  £2,000  $2,750 . Here the coverage tends to cover  the more fanciful predictions of where the technology  might go in the future. Many of these articles predict  that in the future every home will have a 3D printer  and people will be able to print anything they need at  the touch of a button. I do not feel that this is likely  to come to fruition, primarily because of the need to  be able to print in multiple materials. even if it were   132  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   132  9 26 17   3:54 PM   capable of printing them, a home printer would need  to  have  a  large  stock  of  different  materials,  stored  within the home; this is a practical impossibility for  many people and defeats the object.  The Hackspace, Fablab and  maker communities  In order to make the case for the influence of low-cost  printers on the visual arts, we must first understand  how  this  new  field  of  the  low-cost  3D  printer  came  into  existence  and  gained  such  a  large  global  fan  base. I think three mutually beneficial factors have  come together in recent years.  First,  the  creation  of  the  RepRap  project  by  Dr  Adrian  Bowyer  at  the  University  of  Bath.  Bowyer’s  original intention was to prove the concept of a self- replicating machine that could build parts of itself. The  outcome was a cheap, open-source 3D printer built  around the FDM technology developed by Stratasys  and available to all. The plans were downloadable for  free,  and  have  since  been  taken  up,  modified  and  improved  throughout  the  world.  At  its  peak  in  July  2012 there were fifty-three different versions of the  RepRap or RepRap-inspired machines available. This  market has now matured and consolidated.  There is now a whole new generation of machines  that  have  appeared  on  the  market  as  the  original   3D  printing  patents  have  begun  to  expire,  such  as  Forms Labs, with Form Lab 2 based upon the original  Charles  Hull  stereolithography  process.  or  the  Lulzbot and Zortrax, two popular printers based upon  FDM extrusion technology. In my lab in Bristol, we run  a Lulzbot almost full time as it is very cheap to run  and extremely reliable. Finally, based upon the direct  light projection technology is the ember machine by  Autodesk®.  A  second  factor  to  contribute  to  this  explosion  in  the  maker  community  and  low-cost  3D  printing  was  the  introduction  of  affordable  laser  cutting  technology.  Many  of  the  cheaper  Co2  laser  cutters  were  developed  for  commercial  use  in  areas  such  as the textile garment industry, where patterns could  be cut and trialled quickly and easily. The technology  was  taken  up  by  the  arts  community  and  has  now  become commonplace. Laser cutting technology has  worked as a bridge to introduce new users to digital  material  fabrication  technologies.  They  are  much  more ubiquitous than CNC milling technologies and  many are much more user friendly. Therefore users  were already aware of some of the benefits of using  this sort of technology before starting out with low- cost 3D printing machines.  The  third  factor  was  the  development  of  the  FabLabs,  which  were  initially  a  spin  out  from  MIT  intended  for  poor  and  deprived  areas  to  give  communities  access  to  new  technology.  A  FabLab   2  3  2  Unfold, ‘Artifacts of a New History’, one of a series test prints for  printing complex structures in clay.

The  movement  has  spread  rapidly  from  the  first  in  Boston  in  2001  to  1003  worldwide  as  of  September  2016,15  with  more  labs  planned  to  open  in  the  next  year.  The  hackspace  community  has  grown  even  faster  with  a  tenfold  increase  in  ten  years,  from  200  in  2006  to  2082  in  August  2016.16  A  hackspace  is  a  non-commercial,  community-operated  physical  environment,  usually  but  not  exclusively  the  preserve  of  electronics  engineers  and  software  specialists.  Dorkbots  is  a  group  of  affiliated  organisations  worldwide  that  sponsor  grassroots  meetings  of   artists, engineers, designers, scientists, inventors  and anyone else working under the broad umbrella  of electronic art. At the last count there were over  100 active Dorkbot communities.17  A  TechShop  is  an  American  open  source  community  workshop  facility  where  members  pay  to  use  the  TechShop  on  a  commercial  basis.18  TechShops do not seem to have grown at the same  speed  as  hackspace  and  FabLab  communities.  The  breadth  and  size  of  these  movements  and  the excitement they generate can be gauged from  events such as the Maker Faire, of which over 150  took  place  in  2015  and  many  will  draw  crowds  in  excess of 100,000.  4  4  Markus Kayser, Solar  sintering machine.

These groupings have no central core or traditional  structure. To an outsider it can be hard to envision a  definite, coherent and relevant direction for the future  combination of the maker community and the visual  arts. In essence it is for those artists that can both  think visually and make collaboratively using digital  technology. However, it is possible to cite a number  of examples that indicate where the future may lie.  one  of  my  favourite  examples  is  the  CandyFab,  a delightful 3D sugar printer that uses heat to fuse  crystalline sugar. The results can be found on their  website   www.candyfab.org .20  The  last  incarnation  of the machine has been featured on their website  since 2009; you can also find an earlier web video  that shows the printing of a giant screw in hot melted  caramelised  sugar.21  The  range  of  possibilities  of  this 3D sugar technology are endless, transient and  amusing.  From  2013  to  2015,  3D  Systems  made  a  great  play  of  a  sugar  printer,  the  ChefJet,  based  upon the Z Corp powder print technology, which never   seemed to come into production, although the quality  of the parts was very interesting.  Another example of this open source 3D maker  culture is the work of Markus Kayser, a Royal College  of Art  RCA  design graduate: his solar sintering 3D  printer.22 Kayser first built a 2D solar powered laser  cutter that was used in the egyptian desert. The next  machine he built was a 3D sand-sintering machine,  which harnesses the power of the sun’s rays to sinter   melt  sand – much in the manner of a laser sintering  metal 3D printer such as the eoS or Renishaw MTT  machine.  The Dutch Design team Unfold Labs23 have also  made an interesting contribution to the development  of the technology. By replacing the fused plastic with  a  stepper  motor,  an  auger  and  a  plastic  syringe,  the Dutch are able to print in ceramic material and  have produced some very impressive results, which  they are very happy to publish in an open forum and  through the Creative Commons approach.  Functional  coloured  parts  are  one  of  the  holy- grail achievements that will contribute to the future  influence that 3D print has on the broader society.  Stratasys are getting close with their new  2016  J750  machine that prints in full colour and both hard and  soft material. LAIKA, the animation company based  in  Portland,  oregon,  have  used  these  machines  to  print their latest film Kubu and the Two Strings.  6  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   135  7  6, 7  CandyFab, a 3D sugar  printer from evil Mad Scientist  Laboratories, 2009.   evil  Mad Scientist Laboratories.  135  9 26 17   3:54 PM   CAse sTuDy  DON uNDeeN  8  The Buddha's ushnisha is covered in  camera lenses, a nod to contemporary  transcendence.

Given  the  peripheral  nature  of  this  vast  movement  in  relation  to  the  mainstream  arts  practice,  and  in  order  to  place  my  current  thoughts  in  context,  I  interviewed  Don  Undeen,  who  until  2015  was  Senior  Manager  of  the Media Lab at the Metropolitan Museum of Art New  York. Although Don’s current title is as an Independent  Innovation  Strategist,  he  sees  this  role  as  supporting  complicated organisations to create spaces for innovation  and  different  ways  of  doing  business,  trying  to  flip  the  innovation hierarchical model on its head. Don currently  travels  the  world  advising  on  makerspaces  and  new  modes of collaborative making. He says, ‘I don’t believe in  geniuses. I don’t believe in fancy start-ups. I don’t believe  that’s where real change is going to happen. I’m much  more interested in the social good and social change and  empowering people.’ To this end, Don has recently been  working  with  the  Vatican  Arts  and  Technology  Council.  He says, ‘They are all about how to use art to promote  universal human values. We are working out how to itself  use  that  distribution  capacity,  thinking  about  how  you  distribute innovation and creative practice and to all the  dioceses around the world’.  I asked Don when he first engaged with 3D printing and  the associated Maker Movement.   —  I can almost describe it and put a specific date  and time: It was 2012 at a conference called  MCN – Museum Computer Network Conference,  and I went to a seminar by Miriam Langer,  aka ‘@Arduinogirl’ on Twitter™.  She was  running this workshop on Arduino and Making  and Microprocessors. And that is where I was  first exposed to easily programmable micro  controllers. That just changed my life. Because  that was what I have always been interested  in: making stuff. I’ve always been a self-taught  programmer, but when I encountered Arduino  for the first time, it made me realise that all  these software skills I had been learning, I  could bring into the real world really easily, and  that has brought about my whole career, from  thinking about my museum practice, to writing  better information management software, to  really using digital technologies to engage in the  physical world in new ways.  136  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   136  9 26 17   3:54 PM   I  asked  if  2012  was  when  Don  really  encountered  3D  printing.  Yes, originally through work with the Met's  Department of Egyptian Art. They had scanned  an Egyptian mummy in an MRI machine and  extracted some models of Egyptian amulets  from inside the mummy. We took those models  to Makerbot to get them printed and then we  thought, ‘What else can we do with this?’ So  that gave us the idea for the 3D printing and  scanning Hackathon, where we jumped into the  deep end of consumer-oriented 3D scanning and  the technology around 3D print.  When asked about losing traditional skills, Don replied:   —   —  I think you know the answer to that, as well as I  do. These questions often come up where you’re  asked, ‘Don’t these 3D prints destroy creativity?’  I’m very dismissive about that argument; some of  the most critical people clearly don’t fully realise  the amount of creativity and experimentation  that goes into producing quality 3D-printed  artefacts. But what I do say, rather than insulting  people, is if you look at the history of creative  tools and tool-making within artistic practice,    —  you always find that those practitioners who  stick with the traditional tools and methods  see the new technologies as a destruction of  those traditional ways. I would argue that this is  never really the case, and the new technology  inevitably opens up new directions and elevates  creative practice, while they are figuring these  things out. Not only is it a dumb question, I also  think it’s the wrong question – artists are here to  engage with humanity in its current state – this  is what they are for. These tools exist. There isn’t  an organised ‘artists’ technology council’ that  travels around destroying tools. So it’s incumbent  on artists to take on these new tools and find out  what they are good for, how to incorporate them  and eventually master them in their practice;  otherwise, they’re ignoring reality, and usually  that isn’t the job of an artist, to ignore reality –  so therefore the question about creative tools is  the wrong question to ask.  I  wanted  to  find  out  whether  Don  thought  that  DIY  community  has  peaked  along  with  the  rest  of  the  hype  surrounding 3D printing in general. He replied:  To that I would argue that the whole area is in  flux; it isn’t ossified. I think that the practical  business models organizations are developing,  putting walls and structure around these chunks  of creative equipment in order to pay for them  and use them most efficiently, are now the norm.  This is the same evolution and consolidation  that led to clusters of machines brought together  in labs and research hubs, but without the  institutional hierarchy. On a practical level,  that’s what most of these MakerSpaces service  bureaus and technical hubs are accomplishing.  But the other thing I’m seeing more of is co- working, and that is definitely growing. I think the  latest trends in working patterns in the twenty- first century, such as accelerators, incubators  and working from home telecommuting, where  you might be your own boss, are all providing an  environment which is far less about traditional  corporate business and rigid company structures.  For example a company might be formed around  just three individuals, all working on a similar  project with drastically changing needs. They  can’t just buy a big office building and move  everything in like a traditional emerging business  that hits the big time. So there is a whole sector   137  9 26 17   3:54 PM  9  In this work by 3D artist Ryan Kittleson, a 2D image of an oil painting  is converted into a 3D object.

However, they have been around since 2008, so  clearly they have a model that works for them.    It has to be about the people you bring in  and the culture that you build, and if you get  that right, these places really work, but focus  always has to be on how you help new people  develop their ideas. I also work on this group  called Hyphen Hub in New York who run creative  events, outreach and consulting. Also a space  called ‘Cubico’, a co-working space, and they  want to bring us in to help them be more creative  and build a culture where that can happen. They  want to build a small FabLab in their basement  and run events that get interesting people in  and get everyone’s creative juices flowing, which  I think is the right approach – taking the co- working model and taking it on towards creative  makerspaces.  that needs the flexibility to innovate rapidly and  just to grow, and a lot of those people need  equipment to do that, and perhaps they don’t  need to invest in an entire laser cutting machine  or a state of the art 3D printer, perhaps they  only want 10 per cent of a laser cutter, or 5  per cent of a CNC machine or 3D printer, so it  makes sense for those services to remain in a  shared building. That is the type of environment  I see in all the makerspaces that have emerged  in the last ten years or so, and I don’t see that  going away because it works, and the business  models might change and adapt a lot over time  as people's needs, and technology, change. I was  in Bucharest recently, and I had the opportunity  to visit the makerspace there, and it was huge.  Its structure was like a factory, but with rows of  classrooms and white board walls. There was  a business start-up kind of class running there,  and a wall full of glass brick containing a bank  of co-working offices, lots of light etc., all kitted  out how people wanted them and customised  for each company or used for showcasing  their products, and each had access to all the  other things a makerspace should have. It  was like a creative factory with a huge event  space dining hall upstairs, a gorgeous bar, a  kitchen and a huge roof terrace with a view of  the city. The government used the space for  economic business development and embassy  meetings. All right above this hive of activity and  entrepreneurship. The business model was non- profit with a for-profit oriented area alongside,  which subsidised the rent for everyone else.    was this co-working space called ‘Spring House’.  Again it didn’t have much maker gear, but an  excellent restaurant below – actually one of the  best in Amsterdam – that restaurant helped build  relationships between co-workers over half-price  lunches and shared social space, so, again, far  from your traditional office in a glass tower block.    yet; if anything, they are still growing. Possibly  exclusively for-profit models, such as TechShop,  have peaked.    In Washington, DC, there’s ‘Hack DC’,  a strongly community and activist-oriented  hackerspace. The attic and basement had shelves  full of recovered electronics and hardware, and  a table in the middle of it. When I went, the   So those kinds of space haven’t peaked out   Similarly, when I was in Amsterdam, there   10  This same object, viewed head-on, is clearly Rembrandt van Rijn’s  Self-Portrait.

Academic  research is there for the benefit of society and, as  we have said, most of the maker community is both  collaborative and oriented towards the wider society.  Centre for Fine Print Research  CFPR   Consider,  for  example,  our  current  visual  arts  research,  undertaken  by  my  own  institution  at  the  Centre for Fine Print Research  CFPR . Research at  the  CFPR  into  3D  printing  has  been  influenced  by  the need to be able to print objects in real materials  on  machines  that  are  at  least  within  the  budget  of   university art departments. By this I mean not only the  cheap machines described above, but also the mid- priced  machines  in  the  £10,000  to  £60,000  price  bracket  made  by  companies  such  as  3D  Systems,  HP, objet and Stratasys. I have described elsewhere  that  it  is  possible  to  print  in  metal,  sintered  alloys  and  nylon,  but  even  these  materials  do  not  offer  the same properties and qualities of conventionally  formed metals and plastics. Funded by the UK’s Arts  and  Humanities  Research  Council,  our  initial  remit  was  to  undertake  a  survey  of  the  potential  of  3D  printing for artists, craftspeople and designers  which  led  to  this  book .  In  addition,  we  also  developed  a  number  of  case  studies  and  started  printing  for  a  number of artists.  11  12  11  Peter Ting, 3D-printed ceramic double- walled-lattice bowl.

CFPR.  18  Peter Walters, extruded ceramic pot.   Peter Walters 2011.  We  also  believed  that  it  was  possible  to  print  ceramic  materials,  and  to  prove  this  the  team  developed a patented 3D printable ceramic powdered  material24  that  could  be  printed  in  a  3D  Systems  powder  based  printer.  A  further  development  was  to work with Denby Potteries to produce full ceramic  prototypes rather than the plaster versions they had  been capable of previously  see Chapter 5 .  At the CFPR, in common with many of the other  research projects that we undertake and in order to  test  the  parameters  of  the  project,  we  work  with  a  number of artists and designers to create bespoke  artworks  using  a  process.  Peter  Ting  is  a  maker  and  trustee  of  the  UK’s  Crafts  Council.  He  has  created  works  for  Aspreys  and  the  Queen,  and  he  designs  for  Prince  Charles  at  Highgrove.  Peter  was  keen  to  create  a  3D-printed  piece  that  could  not  have been created by any other means. He has an  excellent  understanding  of  industrial  casting  and  moulding  techniques  for  ceramics;  therefore,  he  was  particularly  keen  on  producing  a  double-walled  pierced bowl that could not have been thrown, cast  or moulded by any conventional technique. The final  tea bowl, created in unglazed porcelain, is a delicate  and  gentle  piece  that,  at  first  glance,  belies  its   sophistication and crucially does not look in any way  3D printed until one considers how the piece might  have been created.  When  approaching  my  own  practice  for  a  case  study, I wanted to create a work that had all of the  attributes of a fifteenth-century Renaissance Majolica  bowl  from  Deruta.  The  reason  for  choosing  this  form was that it suited the 3D-printing process and  could be fairly easily created with a simple support  structure to keep its form during firing. It was then  decorated  with  a  standard  white  glaze  and  a  stock  ‘on-glaze’ transfer that bore a passing resemblance  in  colour  and  form  to  the  fifteenth-century  bowls.  I  was striving to make a work that could be mistaken  for a standard piece of domestic ceramics, yet was  based  upon  a  fifteenth-century  design  and  made  with the very latest digital technology – so the very  opposite of trying to create an impossible object.  In  the  context  of  3D  printing,  none  of  these  the  developments  would  be  possible  without  knowledge  and  understanding  of  ceramic  materials  and  processes.  David  Huson  exemplifies  this  tacit  material  understanding.  With  over  thirty  years  of  experience  working  in  the  ceramics  industry,  he  brings  tacit  knowledge  and  experience  of  the   9781474248679_txt_app.indb   141  141  9 26 17   3:55 PM   day- to- day  handling  of  physical  materials  to  our  research.  We  specialise  in  practice-led  and  applied  research. In the case of 3D printing, our success with  ceramics has not been just in material development.  We  conduct  research  into  how  to  embed  that  new  material  knowledge  into  a  traditional  process  that  will  function  from  the  perspective  of  the  end  user.  The  nature  of  printing  ceramics  in  3D  means  that  essentially  we  are  gluing  particles  together  before  they  are  fired.  Therefore,  in  order  for  them  to  hold  together  in  the  kiln  and  follow  the  normal  ceramic  process,  they  need  to  be  supported  in  ways  that  would not be necessary for a conventional material.  It is only with an inherent knowledge of materials that  solutions to these particular problems can be worked  out. It requires a combination of past knowledge and  innovative thinking and very little of that knowledge is  about the 3D-printing process in isolation.  The  ceramics  further  developed  into  a  project  to  develop  a  3D  print  material  based  on  egyptian  Faience  to  create  a  self-glazing  ceramic.  In  other  words, to be able to print a ceramic material in one  go, that when taken from the printer and placed in  the  kiln  will  vitrify  to  a  biscuit  state  and  glaze  all  in  a  single  firing.  This  research  is  based  upon  the  ancient  egyptian  technique  of  Faience,  which  was  the  first  glazed  ceramic  material  produced  around   5000  BC.25  This  ceramic  material  contains  mineral  salts  that  effloresce  to  the  surface  and  create  the  distinctive  colour  and  appearance.  Most  people  recognise the turquoise colour usually seen in small  mummy statues, hippo sculptures or funerary beads  and necklaces.  In  fact  Faience  can  come  in  many  colours,  depending on the metal content added to the salts. In  the New Kingdom at the latter stages of the egyptian  empire,  the  egyptians  used  a  process  known  as  cementation – a process that was still used until the  1960s in Qom in Iran where the donkey beads they  made were packed into glaze material in a saggar and  fired. When the kiln was unpacked, the glaze material  would still be friable apart from where it had been in  contact with the egyptian Faience beads. At this point  of contact, the material would form the glaze on the  surface of the Faience. We have spent several years  replicating faience with 3D printing, with a great deal  of success. Although we never achieved our original  goals  of  a  single  fired  artefact  consistently,  the  results have been exciting and pushed our knowledge  of 3D-printed ceramics into new territories.  In  parallel  with  this  research  and  in  order  to  better  understand  the  potential  of  the  low  cost  3D  printers  for  visual  artists  and  designers,  the  CFPR  have  invested  in  a  number  of  these  machines,   20  19  David Huson and Katie Vaughan, CFPR Labs, 3D-printed faience  hippo.

To the  3D  Systems  machines  we  have  added  a  pressure  head  and  an  auger  to  print  pastes  and  viscous  liquids in surprisingly fine detail. With this machine,  Dr Peter Walters has managed to print using many  different  types  of  material,  including  icing  sugar,  chocolate,  clay,  potato  starch  and  edible  batters.  In collaboration with the artist Debbie Southerland,  Peter  and  David  Huson  produced  sugar  teeth  and  lace pancakes.  Perhaps the items that Peter and the CFPR have  produced  that  have  stimulated  the  most  interest  were the 3D-printed ‘meat and two veg’. To achieve  this,  a  liver  paté  was  used  alongside  mushy  peas  and mashed potato. The serious intent behind this  research was to prove that it was possible to 3D print   the   a full meal, albeit one that wouldn’t win any Michelin  stars for culinary excellence! My  personal  view  of   future  and,  by  association,  the  view  of  the  research  centre,  is  to  a  large  extent  coloured  by  the  research  we  are  in  the  process  of  undertaking.  In  addition,  we  at  the  CFPR  see  3D  printing  for  artists  as  a  tool  to  produce  bespoke  artworks  for  everyone,  whether  designer,  craftsperson,  artist  or  artisan.  The  future  of  many  manufacturing  technologies  lies  with  the  ability to mass customise to an individual customer  requirement.  Mass  customisation  of  3D  printing  allows objects to be created in mass but with each  one having individual and separate modifications to  the object printed next to it. one of the future paths of  this technology is the ability to tailor each and every  object to the individual customer needs and desires.  21  23  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   143  22  21, 22, 23  David Huson, CFPR  Labs, 3D-printed ceramic lattices.    David Huson.  143  9 26 17   3:55 PM   CAse sTuDy  THe CeNTRe FOR  DIGITAL DesIGN AND  MANuFACTuRING  DDM   The  other  arts  institution  in  the  UK  that  has  pioneered  materials  research  for  the  visual  arts  is  the  Centre  for  Digital Design and Manufacturing at the School of Jewellery  at Birmingham City University, managed by Frank Cooper,  who  has  undertaken  much  research  in  collaboration  with  Cookson  Gold  to  produce  3D-printed  gold,  silver  and  platinum  using  their  own  Cooksongold  Precious  M080  Direct Metal Laser Melting  DMLM  technology based in The  School of Jewellery.   When did you first start using 3D printing and what led  you into using it?   —  for silversmithing and can print bigger objects,  but we don’t cast from it. We did print rubber  moulds in their Tango material and then inject  in wax; for the lost cast investment process,  we worked primarily in the West Midlands for  local companies, but now not only jewellery and  silversmithing but also some small automotive  and aerospace companies. We also work with lots  of small art foundries in the Midlands. There are  a surprising number of these foundries remaining  in the area; they use the 3D Prototype as a  master pattern to make a suitable mould for their  traditional casting methods such as sand and  wax and shell casting.     We have recently finished working on an  Innovate UK project with a number of UK  partners which was called Precious that was  intended to prove the DMLM in precious metals  for jewellery applications process from beginning  to end, through design, support structures, laser  sintering and various polishing techniques to  arrive at the final item.    Probably twelve to fifteen years ago now was  when we started printing directly into wax   as part of the jewellery manufacturing ‘lost  wax investment casting’ process which is the  industry standard , although 3D printing had  been peripherally part of the jewellery industry  for about five years previously. The ModelMaker  II  now called SolidScape  machine was then  undoubtedly the state of the art and is to this  day still pretty much a jewellery industry and  dependable and standardised process. Although  the early versions had a reputation for having a  few nozzle jet problems, and you really couldn’t  turn them off for two weeks over Christmas or  it could take four weeks to start them up again,  but we use and abuse our SolidScape 3Z Pro  now and it still churns out perfectly usable and  reliable pieces for the jewellery casting process.    We were originally set up to train local  jewellers and silversmiths with just one printing  technology using a ModelMaker II machine  and one jewellery specific version of CAD, and  we grew from there. We eventually acquired  enough capital money from an EU funded  project to invest in new software, some extra  skilled employees researchers and the means to  purchase an EnvisionTec Perfactory and a ProJet  CPX 3500 Max.     ongoing projects we were using an Objet  printer with a bigger build bed, which is good   Before the technology upgrade, for other   So  how  much  direct  precious  metal  3D  printing  is  happening?   —  There are, of course, other technologies   There’s not a lot yet in the UK and we have  the only DMLM machine dedicated to printing  in precious metals in UK academia and I’m  only aware of one manufacturing jeweller in  the UK using it, and there are several jewellery  manufacturers around Europe and the world  specifically using the Cooksongold Precious MO80.     available that can and are successfully printing  in precious metals in use around Europe with  much of the research being driven by companies  who can also manufacture and distribute the  complex precious metal powders required for  these machines. The use of precious metals  brings with it added complexities of high cost,  metal security and minimising material losses;  based on current, fluctuating metal prices, one  kilo of eighteen carat gold would cost in the  region of thirty-five thousand pounds sterling.  Which  new  hardware  products  are  you  using  at  the  moment and why?   —  Much of the current research we are doing  is with an Ember machine and we are  experimenting with various castable resins from  various sources, as well as the Ember proprietary   144  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   144  9 26 17   3:55 PM   materials, and those resins generally print and  cast incredibly well. These technologies are also  good for those smaller jewellery cooperatives  where a group get together to share a premises,  software and machines. It works out much  cheaper than the service bureaus and the bigger,  more expensive ‘industrial based’ machines.  Whose technology, in your opinion, is producing the best  quality output these days?   —   —  There isn’t actually a 3D printer out there that  will print beautiful exquisite finished jewellery,  whether we are talking about a direct metal 3D  print or a wax to casting 3D print; a lot of the  artisan craft skills still have to go into completing  it. I think exponents of the technology transfer  from digital to finished object such as Lionel  Dean, Marianne Forrest and, more recently, Jack  Row are all doing fantastic work. Jack Row’s  metal fountain pens are gorgeous, and he has  a very high-end, niche market in Dubai which is   definitely at the wealthier end of the market.  What software do you use to create your work and why do  you choose that particular product?  We go to great lengths here at the School and  DDM to explain that there is no algorithm that  will produce a piece of beautiful designed and  exquisite jewellery. It can only be designed and  created by someone who has an eye for the  attractive and appealing jewellery piece they   desire to produce. Someone who can decide which  iteration, generated in whatever CAD programme  they are using, is worth following and whether  all the others can be discarded, as well as an  understanding of precious metals, stones and the  desired manufacturing process to be used. Also,  the printers don’t produce anything without a really  good quality CAD file to base it on. Our students  tend to predominantly prefer using Rhinoceros   Rhino  because it’s familiar, user friendly, fairly  reliable, affordable and as close to an industry  standard as we’re likely to get. We also use a  number of jewellery specific CAD products such  as Matrix, JewlCad, ArtCam Jewellsmith, 3Design  Jewell and many others. Solidworks is also useful  for the horology students who need the precision  and accuracy of a more engineering based  programme. Rhino is probably the most popular  of the bunch amongst our student body, but there  still isn’t a single killer product yet that’s universally  used and I don’t think there ever will be. In a  survey carried out as part of the PRECIOUS project  of over 300 jewellers they were identified as using  forty-two different software packages.  Where do you see the future of 3D printing?    —  Well, in my personal view and from a jewellery  specific standpoint, the future’s bright. The scope  is almost unlimited for people prepared to take  what it has the potential to offer and run with it.   2015 , Tauber, A. ‘The Fungus That   1  Could Replace Plastic’, Motherboard,  August 19.

I could have  included fashion and animation in the chapter on designers, but I feel these  two areas are pushing the technology into interesting new territory.  Fashion  Iris van Herpen, for example, presents stunning new  work that pushes the boundaries of the technology in  order to create functional wearable garments. Time  magazine  named  van  Herpen’s  3D-printed  dresses  one of the ‘50 Best Inventions of 2011’. Based in  Amsterdam, she studied under Alexander McQueen.  Her 3D work is made in collaboration with the Belgian  3D printing bureau service iMaterialise™.  In an interview with Wired magazine, she states:  ‘3D  printing  freed  me  from  all  physical  limitations.  Suddenly, every complex structure was possible and  I could create more detail than I ever could by hand’. Stars such as Lady Gaga, a recent client of both  Van  Herpen  and  the  Los  Angeles–based  fashion  designer Michael Schmidt, demonstrate the current  appeal of 3D printing. For a recent collection, ‘Hybrid  Holism’,  Van  Herpen  made  nine  3D-printed  pieces,  manufactured  in  materials  ranging  from  plastic  to  rubber  and  metal.  For  her  first  couture  show  in   Paris,  van  Herpen  worked  with  architect  Daniel  Widrig  and  used  rapid  prototyping  technology  to  create her 3D-printed collection ‘escapism Couture’.  Her  designs  were  printed  using  a  nylon  polyamide  material. However, Van Herpen believes that fashion  should be an artistic expression, not just about new  and innovative techniques, so instead she combines  handcrafted pieces with 3D printing.1  It  is  easy  to  see  why  a  fashion  designer  of  bespoke garments would want to use 3D printing to  make  clothes.  Professor  Neri  oxman  from  the  MIT  Media  Lab  makes  wearable  objects  that  make  us  think about what we might be wearing in the future   see  Chapter  5 .  oxman’s  official  title  is  the  ‘Sony  Corporation  Career  Development  Professor  and  Assistant  Professor  of  Media  Arts  and  Sciences  at  the MIT Media Lab’, where she founded and directs  the Mediated Matter research group. As technology  increasingly  becomes  interdisciplinary,  so  too  do  the people that use it. oxman is a good exemplar:  a well-respected architect, designer and now fashion   146  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   146  9 26 17   3:55 PM   designer,  having  recently  created  the  ‘Imaginary  Beings, Mythologies of the Not Yet’ exhibition at the  Pompidou Centre. Before this oxman and her team  were working on a series of body armour based on  human  tissue.  When  describing  part  of  the  project  ‘Carpal Skin’ on the MIT website, oxman explains,2  ‘“Carpal Skin” is a prototype for a protective glove to  protect  against  carpal  tunnel  syndrome,  a  medical  condition in which the median nerve is compressed  at  the  wrist,  leading  to  numbness,  muscle  atrophy  and weakness in the hand’.  In an article for the web-based magazine Popular  Science,  oxman  expands  on  the  reaction  diffusion  systems at the core of the project: ‘Most patterns in  nature –whether scales or spiderwebs – have some  kind of logic that can be computationally modelled’.  The  editorial  explains  that  to  build  some  of  her  armours,  oxman  and  her  colleague  Craig  Carter  formulated  equations  based  on  reaction  diffusion  systems.  From  these  oxman  created  bitmaps.  She  then  feeds  these  bitmaps  into  the  printer    objet  Connex™   to  construct  functionally  graded  materials   FGMs .  These  are  the  opposite  of  most  manmade  materials,  which  are  homogeneous  and  have the same hardness throughout. The materials  have  differing  flexibilities  built  in.  By  constructing  her  armour  in  minute  layers,  her  creations  are  as  multipurpose  as  our  pores:  ‘our  skin  is  structured  not unlike FGMs: on our face our pores are large, for  filtering,  while  our  back  pores  are  small,  to  form  a  more protective barrier’.3  Similarly,   the  well-known  couture  designer  Hussain  Chalayon,  whose  work  also  pays  homage  to Alexander McQueen, used 3D printing as part of  a cross-disciplinary art installation, ‘I Am Sad Layla’   2011 ,  at  the  Lisson  Gallery,  London.  In  a  video  interview with Greg Hilty, the Curatorial Director of the  Lisson Gallery, Chalayon explains that he 3D printed  a  white  female  figure,  using  a  laser  sintered  nylon,  wearing  one  of  his  own  garments,  onto  which  he  projected  a  film  of  a  singer  performing  the  Turkish  song on which the installation was based.4  CAse sTuDy  MICHAeL sCHMIDT  Wardrobing and jewellery designer Michael Schmidt has  garnered  the  attention  of  the  world’s  top  entertainers,  stylists, photographers and directors for his expertise with  a variety of innovative materials and techniques.

I asked when he had first  started using 3D printing and what led him into using it.  ‘I’ve followed the evolution of 3D printing for 30 years,  anticipating its usefulness to the fashion industry. only  now is it ripening as a viable tool for the average designer.  My  first  project  was  the  fully  articulated  printed  gown  I  designed for burlesque icon Dita Von Teese in 2013’.  The floor length gown was designed by Schmidt and the  code  was  generated  by  architect  Francis  Bitonti,  using  laser  sintered  nylon.  Draped  over  a  nude  silk  corset,  the black-lacquered dress is cinched in at the waist and  exaggerated at the shoulders, and embellished with over  50,000 Swarovski crystals. The rigid plastic components  are  fully  articulated  using  a  net  structure  to  allow  for  movement.  This  groundbreaking  flexible  ‘fabric’,  printed  straight  from  a  computer,  was  the  result  of  countless  hours between Michael and Bitonti:   —  Francis was able to take my sketches for the  dress and its articulated joints, which I created  specifically for Dita, and render those in the  specialised language of the software. The file  was printed by Shapeways™ in New York, in  seventeen sections that were then hand-linked  together into the dress. The dress was then  polished and lacquered black, and more than  50,000 black Swarovski crystals were hand  applied to give the overall effect of shimmer.  2  Dita Von Teese, 3D-printed Dress.

In 2010 the Pasadena  Museum of California Art honored Michael with a career  retrospective.  Since 2001 he has designed an exclusive collection of  jewellery, bags, clothing and furniture for the international  luxury goods firm Chrome Hearts. He enjoys an on-going  collaborative relationship with designers such as Jeremy  Scott  and  contributed  accessories  for  the  Spring  2013  collection  of  designer  Brandon  Sun.  Tour  wardrobing  continues  to  be  a  specialty  of  Michael’s  studio,  which  created  nearly  300  pieces  for  Madonna’s  2012  MDNA  World Tour, his fourth tour with the artist.  When asked what proportion of his work involved 3D print,  he  explained,  ‘I  use  3D  printing  primarily  as  a  tool  for  prototyping new jewellery designs, although occasionally  I  will  incorporate  it  into  my  couture  work.’  Why  does  he  use  3D  printing,  and  what  factors qualities  does  he  think  it  offers  over  traditional  processes?  ‘Fashion,  like  technology, is forever in pursuit of innovation. As a medium  for creating forms which could not be realised any other  way,  3D  printing  has  exciting  prospects  for  a  designer.  New printable materials and finishes are advancing every  day  which  have  the  potential  to  make  fashion  and  3D  printing an intriguing pairing.’  I  asked  whether  when  he  used  3D  printing  in  a  piece  of work, was it solely created with 3D printing or did he  combine it with traditional technologies. He replied, ‘While  3D printing is exciting, it is a tool, a means to an end.  Technology exists to serve the human imagination as an   148  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   148  9 26 17   3:55 PM   When I asked, as an artist, did he think he was giving up  his traditional craft skills, or did he think 3D printing had  its own craft sensibilities? His reply neatly summarised  the views of many of the art and design practitioners that  I interviewed: ‘I am appreciative of 3D printing as a tool  for the exploration of unusual forms, but only in so much  as it complements the handmade. My larger interest lies  in  aiding  traditional  craft  techniques  through  advanced  means in every facet of the arts.’  Finally, I asked where he sees the future of 3D printing  for  artists,  designers  and  craftspeople.  He  said,  ‘The  potential of these astonishing machines is only beginning  to  be  understood.  The  future  of  3D  printing,  however,  lies in the evolution of the materials it can print, not just  in  the  technology  itself.  This  continued  exploration  will  ensure there is no end to the fantastical creations made  possible by this marvellous innovation’.  A note: I am very grateful to Michael Schmidt for allowing  me to interview him. one of the hardest parts of updating  this book has been getting permission from commercial  organisations  and  the  more  commercial  designers  in  this chapter for interviews and picture credits. Therefore,  some of this information is not firsthand and comes from  secondary sources. As a researcher I would much have  preferred  to  use  entirely  primary  source  information,  but  some  aspects  of  the  subject  have  to  be  covered  regardless of source material.  3  Dita Von Teese, 3D-printed Dress Gown Detail  extension of the hand. I would never utilise a printed item  in my work without embellishing it in some way.’  I then asked him the standard question: Which software  hardware do you use in your work and why do you choose  that  particular  product?  Interestingly,  he  replied  that  design dictates its creation: ‘I allow the piece to tell me  how  it  wishes  to  be  fabricated.  When  incorporating  3D  printing into a design, the parameters of the end product  will  specify  material  necessities,  which  then  indicate  equipment and software’. I believe this comment sums  up a good designer’s approach to technology. Without a  tacit understanding of the materials intended for use in  the process, he would not be able to use those processes  to the benefit of the material aesthetic.  His reply and approach also predicates the answer to my  following  question  exploring  the  barriers  to  3D  printing  specifically – that the fundamental quality of the materials  is not yet sophisticated enough for a fashion designer’s  requirements.   —  The biggest obstacle to a more widespread use  of 3D printing in clothing is the lack of printable  materials that mimic qualities of familiar  fabrics such as cottons, woollens, leather etc.  Once printable materials evolve to incorporate  properties such as breathability, washability  and dye fastness, we will start to see real  applications of this innovation in the fashion  realm.  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   149  149  9 26 17   3:55 PM   Animation  A  completely  different  field  to  fashion,  stop-motion  animation  is  an  area  within  the  animation  industry  that has taken 3D technology on board and is rapidly  becoming  an  integral  part  of  the  tool  kit.  The  big  budget  mainstream  stop-motion  companies  have  the  resources  and  imperative  to  invest  in  high- quality  3D  printing.  There  is  a  commercial  drive  to  reduce costs and cope with the logistics of running  multiple film set stages simultaneously, in order to  speed  production  times.  The  initial  impetus  seems  to have been financial; it would be cheaper to print  the individual parts in 3D than pay someone to sculpt  them by hand. But I suspect we are now beginning  to see a new tool kit for creating animation that will  have  a  different  sensibility  to  the  traditional  hand- crafted plasticine and will slowly develop into a genre  of its own.  There  is  no  doubt  that  3D  printing  is  having  a  significant  influence  on  stop-motion  animation  and  that  it  is  growing  into  an  important  area  of  the  creative  arts.  Animators  are  increasingly  using  the  technology  from  the  simplest  of  machines  to  the   most  sophisticated.  Not  only  have  the  big-feature  animation  studios  realised  the  benefits  of  printing  character  puppet  parts in 3D – to reduce production  costs and speed up the animation process – but also  the  process  was  found  to  offer  creative  benefits,  and  in  doing  so  gave  the  studios  greater  creative  freedom.  For  example,  they  could  make  many  more  mouth  shapes  to  achieve  greater  expression  in  the  characters. The first company to produce a full feature  film  using  3D  printing  was  LAIKA  Digital  Design  Group with Henry Selick’s film ‘Coraline’, released in  2009.  LAIKA  developed  a  technique  of  first  making  the models in clay, then scanning them into Maya®   industry-standard  software  used  for  3D  animation  rendering  then remodelling them for 3D printing whilst  trying  to  retain  as  much  of  the  detail  of  the  hand- crafted  process  captured  in  the  scans  as  possible.  The models were printed using an objet Geometrics  machine  and  then  painted  after  cleaning.  However,  this  was  just  the  beginning  of  the  process;  printing  3D models requires file formats that are capable of  being  output  as  STL  files  and  then  printed  as  solid  models. An article in CG magazine gives a very good  description of the process involved in the film:  4  ‘Coraline’, the first 3D-printed feature film, 2009.   LAIKA Digital.  150  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   150  9 26 17   3:55 PM   5  Paranorman, printed with Z Corp colour printer.   LAIKA Digital.  The  CG  modellers  that  were  hired  for  the  film  came  expecting  a  more  or  less  traditional  pipeline,  but  found they needed to retrain themselves for ‘Coraline’.  Although  you  never  see  it,  behind  each  face  is  an  elaborate  registration  system  and  custom  engineered  eye mechanics. Here, instead of creating a model for  digital  rendering,  the  3D  printing  was  the  rendering  process,  so  new  rules  needed  to  be  considered.  The  skin  had  to  have  thickness  throughout  rather  than  just  being  a  digital  shell.  Teeth  were  modelled  to  be  snapped  in  and  out  through  the  back  of  Coraline’s  head.  The  interior  of  her  mouth  included  the  uvula,  tongue,  and  the  space  under  her  tongue,  something  that would have been too time consuming if sculpted  through traditional methods. Those details were in every  face  even  when  they  weren’t  visible.  To  increase  the  total number of available expressions, the faces were  modelled and output through 3D printing in upper and  lower halves split across the bridge of the nose, yielding  207,336 possible facial positions for Coraline, allowing  for extremely subtle animation. LAIKA estimated that to  accomplish this without the CG and 3D printer process  would have taken ten sculptors four years to complete.5  Two things are clear from this passage. Although  3D  printing  can  speed  up  the  animation  process  enormously, it can also create extra problems. All of  the  animation  created  has  to  be  digitally  corrected  after filming to remove the join lines in the faces – in  this case, across the bridge of the nose. Then there  is the logistical problem of tracking many thousands  of printed parts, which might be needed to create just  a  few  seconds  of  animation.  When  LAIKA  released  their third full-length 3D-printed feature film, Boxtrolls   2014 , the film was printed on a 3D Systems  Z Corp   650  full  colour  printer,  which  uses  a  plaster-based  material. LAIKA printed all the parts in the standard  3D  Systems  material  and  then  strengthened  them  using the Z bond cyanoacrylate resin to harden them. To an informed 3D print user, it may seem that  that  the  Z  Corp  process  offers  less  definition  of  feature, and parts are inevitably much less crisp with  poorer  surface  quality.  However,  the  Z  Corp  offers  three major advantages to the animator. The first is  obviously cost  i.e., the materials are less expensive  overall .  However,  the  other  two  advantages  are  particularly  interesting  for  the  visual  arts:  colour   9781474248679_txt_app.indb   151  151  9 26 17   3:55 PM   printing  and  a  textured  surface  finish.  The  Z  Corp  will  print  in  colour,  but  the  colour  range   gamut   is  restricted  in  terms  of  what  we  are  used  to  with  modern  2D  inkjet  printing.  LAIKA  have  turned  this  to their advantage and used the colour to create a  particular atmosphere. Animators can use any colour  they want to create a perception of reality – it does  not need to be real to look real.  This  brings  us  to  the  third  and  final  point:  the  surface  finish  of  a  Z  Corp  model.  When  viewed  closely, the surface has a textured appearance that  could  almost  be  termed  ‘fluffy’.  Again,  the  LAIKA  animators  have  made  a  virtue  of  this  aspect  and  used  the  surface  appearance  much  more  widely  across the whole film to create a particular raw feel. I  would  argue  this  slightly  textured  surface  and  feel  moves  the  appearance  of  the  characters  away  from  the  slick  plastic  look  of  both  the  objet  and  envisionTeC™  printed  models  used  in  LAIKA’s  ‘Coraline’  and  Aardman  Animation’s  The  Pirates!  In  an Adventure with Scientists. Both films have a look  that  is  somewhere  between  stop  motion  and  CGI,  which I would argue loses some of the hand-rendered  qualities  of  plasticine.  In  Boxtrolls,  LAIKA’s  original   animation process brings back some of that softer,  more viewer-friendly appearance.  3D  printing  is  now  a  fixture  in  stop-motion  animation and it is only a matter of time before a good  quality short animation appears using the cheap FDM  machines  –  much  in  the  manner  that  Bob  Godfrey  revolutionised  the  traditional  analogue  animation  cell  by  using  marker  pens  to  draw  ‘Roobarb’6  in  1974.  Already  there  are  a  series  of  low  cost  FDM  animations on YouTube. Perhaps my favourite of the  low cost 3D printed stop motion animations is ‘Bears  on Stairs’, which can be viewed on Vimeo.7  The  Pirates!  In  an  Adventure  with  Scientists,  directed by Peter Lord and Jeff Newitt, was released  in  March  2012.  The  puppets  were  printed  using  envisionTeC™ machines. Aardman ran three of these  machines full time during the filming, producing an  estimated  50,000  parts.  Aardman  chose  to  use  envisionTeC™  because  of  its  ability  to  print  in  a  flesh-coloured material, thus reducing the amount of  painting necessary in order to produce camera-ready  parts.  Aardman also used 3D printing to create ‘Dot’, the  world’s smallest animated 3D character, who was just   6  152  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   152  9 26 17   3:56 PM   7  The Pirates!

The film was created to promote  the Nokia N8 phone and the Cellscope, a diagnostic- quality  microscope  that  was  invented  by  Daniel  Fletcher at the University of California, Berkeley, that  turns a mobile phone into a microscope.8 The figures  for ‘Dot’ were again printed on the envisionTeC™ and  hand  painted,  but  in  this  case  it  was  not  possible  to  create  either  articulated  figures  or  figures  with  snap-on parts, so each animated movement required  a  complete  printed  figure.  ‘Dot’  can  be  found  on  YouTube.9  Since  2012,  developments  have  moved  rapidly  within the field of 3D-printed stop motion animation.  Without  a  doubt  the  leader  in  the  field  is  LAIKA,  whose  latest  films  Boxtrolls  and  Kubu  and  the  Two  Strings have again used 3D printing in order to push  the boundaries of what is possible with the medium.  LAIKA constantly try to push the technology. Whilst  Boxtrolls  was  printed  on  the  four  colour   CMYK   Z650 machines, their most recent film Kubu and the  Two  Strings  was  created  using  the  Stratasys  J750  machine for the creatures and the 3D Systems Z650    latest machine Projet 60 series  for all of the human  characters.  In 2016 I met Brian McClaine, Director of Rapid  Prototying  at  LAIKA.  For  their  next  film  LAIKA  will  be  3D  printing  using  the  newly  released  six  colour  Stratasys  J750  machine  that  uses  cyan,  magenta,  yellow and black, plus white and clear. We discussed  LAIKA’s approach to colour and how this dictates the  machines they use.  When LAIKA first got 650s, they were the very first  four colour machines for 3D printing available on the  market.  In  order  to  understand  what  the  machines  were capable of, LAIKA produced a series of definitive  colour  tests  that  tested  not  only  the  gamut  but  also the surface appearance and colour quality the  machine was capable of. They then printed what they  describe as a 3D-printed Pantone equivalent set; all  the puppets were then printed and colours chosen in  relation to these colour swatches, enabling LAIKA to  print consistently throughout. With the arrival on the  market of the objet Connex 500 machine  now owned  by  Stratasys ,  LAIKA  collaborated  with  Stratasys  to   9781474248679_txt_app.indb   153  153  9 26 17   3:56 PM   8  9  154  8, 9  ‘Dot’, the world’s smallest  3D-printed animation made in  conjunction with the Nokia N8  microscope.

Because the machine was only  capable of printing two colours at a time, it was not  possible to print multi-colour combinations in one go,  but any combination of two colours could be printed.  Stratasys  allowed  LAIKA  the  ability  to  adjust  the  firmware to their needs. LAIKA reversed engineered  the  colouring  process  for  the  puppets,  having  first  created a set of colour combinations they could work  with.  LAIKA,  on  average,  print  a  stock  set  of  around  5000 parts for a film. Initially they could print up to  207,366 facial expressions; now their combinations  of prints allow them to print up to 5,000,000 facial  expressions. LAIKA’s latest acquisition is a number  of  Stratasys  J750  full  colour  machines   usually  CMYK  plus  clear  and  white .  LAIKA  worked  with  the  Fraunhofer  Institute  on  their  colour  print  driver  Cuttlefish to obtain reliable full colour prints that can  be either transparent or opaque.  In  2015  an  unusual  3D-printed  feature  film  came to fruition: Anomalisa, 3D-printed by Starburns  Industries,  directed  by  Charlie  Kaufmann  and  Duke  Johnson. Anomalisa is a life-like movie printed on 3D   Systems Projet 600 series printers  four colour powder  deposition printers , which give a soft quality to the  face parts that were printed for the film. Interestingly  unlike  the  LAIKA  or  Aardman  films,  Starburns  deliberately chose not to remove the joint lines in the  face  parts  –  for  example,  those  that  occur  when  a  mouth is clipped into the armature with a separate set  of eye-pieces. Both LAIKA and Aardman remove these  joint lines in post-production and digitally correct this  on screen. In an interview for Indiwire, Dan Driscoll,  who worked on Anomalisa, was quoted as saying that  this was a conscious decision that created a particular  feeling of the world the movie was set in.  I  find  this  an  interesting  development  that  means  animated  3D  printing  is  building  its  own  visual  aesthetic  and  parameters  based  upon  the  technology itself and how an audience will react to  a different aesthetic. I also think that the use of two  different  technologies  in  the  same  film  by  LAIKA  is  also a progression in creating this new look and feel.  None of the companies say that the process speeds  up  production.  More  pertinently,  it  allows  them  to  create models in a very different way, and nearly all  say  that  they  could  not  have  made  the  films  using   9781474248679_txt_app.indb   155  155  9 26 17   3:57 PM   the old hand techniques. I wonder if that will change  back as an anti-reaction to the digital or whether the  3D-printed stop motion is a half-way house between  computer animation and hand rendered stop motion. Both  of  these  high-profile  areas,  fashion  and  animation, have adopted the technology in a big way.  For example, LAIKA were by far the biggest buyer of  3D Systems Projet powder deposition materials for  the  650  machines.  And  Adidas,  one  of  the  world’s   most famous sports brands, has launched into mass  market 3D printing. They have announced their plans  to launch their first mass produced pair of trainers,  the Futurecraft 4D. The company has experimented  with  3D  printing  before,  but  never  on  this  scale.  They  have  plans  to  produce  five  thousand  pairs  in  2017, and they plan to increase this to one hundred  thousand pairs by 2018.10  1  Venkataramanan, M.  2012 ,  ‘Couture Built Layer by Layer’, Wired  Magazine, June: 45. 2  oxman, N.  2012 , ‘Carpal Skin’, MIT  website, 27 November.

CFPR 2012.  Conclusion  In  concluding  my  examination  of  3D  printing  and  the visual arts, the usual form would be to round up  the state of the current technology and try to make  some form of future prediction. In this case, that is  somewhat of a problem. First, I have already given an  overview of the current state of the technology and  outlined the early history of the process, both in terms  of the machinery and visual arts users’ interface with  3D  printing.  only  a  fool  would  make  any  concrete  predictions of the technologies’ future. I have clearly  stated that I am a fan and advocate of 3D printing  and firmly believe that this is a disruptive technology  that will change the face of manufacturing.  However,  this  is  a  book  about  the  interface  of  the  visual  arts  with  3D  printing  technology,  and  it  is  that  interface  from  which  I  shall  draw  some  conclusions. I think the future is exciting and believe  its development is similar to that of the revolutionary  changes  in  2D  digital  printing  technologies  –  in  particular,  wide-format  printing  as  an  extension  of  desktop.  For  the  creative  industries,  I  believe  that  3D  printing  will  develop  into  a  mature  technology  that  becomes  a  major  part  of  the  artist’s  tool  kit.  Interestingly, many of the discussions of 3D printing  in the media are concerned with the issue of originality  and intellectual property; who owns this process – or   even the files? What will happen to the integrity and  intellectual property of an artist or designer when it  is possible to just press a button and print a digital  facsimile?  This  ‘old  chestnut’  has  equally  taxed  the  2D  print  market  with  the  introduction  of  digital  technology.  In  this  arena,  people  realised  that  the  amount  of  work  necessary  to  produce  an  accurate  facsimile still required a high degree of craft skill to  make the copy look accurate. Most people don’t want  to go to the effort to replicate an image or a designer  product themselves as it is already possible to buy  perfectly  good  facsimiles.  What’s  more,  the  vast  majority certainly do not possess the necessary skill  to create such copies. Another factor is provenance:  90 per cent of us know that they are copies because  the  provenance  that  comes  with  them   i.e.,  cost,  quality of manufacture or place of purchase  are all  clear indicators of copied goods. The same factors  will occur in the 3D print marketplace.  We  also  need  to  address  the  amount  of  hype  that surrounds 3D printing and manage perceptions  of what it is actually possible to create using such  processes. It is not possible for a 3D printer to print  itself, a gun or a car as claimed online, nor in fact is  it  possible  to  replicate  almost  any  object  to  order.  Let  us  deal  with  each  of  these  myths  separately.   9781474248679_txt_app.indb   157  157  9 26 17   3:57 PM   The  self-replicating  3D  printer  as  demonstrated  by  the  RepRap  project  has  not  only  revolutionised  the  field  of  low-cost,  open  source  printers,  but  in  fact  the  department  created  it.  However,  the  printers  can  only  self-replicate  and  print  those  parts  of  the  machine  that  can  be  made  from  ABS  plastic.  In  total, this probably comes to 25% of the total parts  of  the  whole  machine  and  certainly  does  not  deal  with  the  stepper  motors,  electrics,  computer  chips  and boards. So the machine is not self-replicating. In  research terms, the project proved the potential for a  self-replicating machine, but it has not become more  than  a  potential.  Likewise  with  the  mythical  gun;  it  is  possible  to  print  the  gunstock,  and  theoretically  one  could  print  a  barrel  in  stainless  steel,  but  this  would have to be milled and heavily post-processed  before it was functional, if one trusted the capability  of 3D-printed steel to carry the forces of an explosive  charge. Creating a 3D-printed working car is just not  possible even theoretically at this point in time. As we  have stated elsewhere, the primary reason is simply  that most objects are made from multiple materials  and at a basic count there are at least 50 different  materials in the average car and over 10,000 parts.  At this point in time there is no printer that will print a  combination of materials such as metal and plastic. Contrary  to  2012  and  the  first  edition  of  this  book,  the  hype  surrounding  3D  printing  has  begun  to  settle.  Currently  there  is  a  ‘hype  curve’  that  is  published annually by Gartner.1 In their 2012 ‘Hype  Cycle  for  emerging  Technologies’,  3D  printing  was  very firmly at the top of the curve. In 2016 it was in  the  slough  of  despondency.  This  is  not  to  say  that  the  technology  will  not  catch  up  with  its  perceived  potential  –  I  am  sure  that  it  will  eventually.  For  example, in a film made by the Arts and Humanities  Research Council about CFPR’s 3D ceramics I stated  that I believed that it would be fifteen years before  3D-printed  ceramics  became  a  commercial  reality.  This is a comment that, as an academic, I stand by;  it is my job to be cautious and reasoned.  So  what  do  I  feel  about  the  conception  and  processes  involved  in  making  works  of  art  using  3D  printing  in  the  future?  As  an  arts  practitioner  with nearly thirty years experience in the field of the  arts – my primary view for the visual arts is that the  technology is still very limited in its material qualities;   this means that the potential for creating good art is  also very limited. As I stated in Chapter 4, fused nylon  or photopolymeric plastics are not materials with which  artists would have a natural affinity – if you print in a  raw white nylon material, the resultant print looks like  raw white nylon. The designers such as Assa Ashuach  who  are  polishing  and  dying  it  are  giving  this  single  material a much greater range of visual appearance  and physical properties, but, I would argue, it is still a  material that has very little visual appeal or interesting  surface characteristics in its own right. Until materials  come onto the market with more interesting or variable  surface  characteristics  that  have  a  greater  visual  appeal,  this  will  always  be  a  problem.  Some  of  the  examples  that  I  have  cited,  such  as  Karin  Sander’s  miniature  people  and  Morison’s  kite  structure,  overcome this problem by hiding the actual 3D-printed  material as part of the object’s construction process:  Sander  sprays  her  work  and  Morison  covers  the  joints in kite fabric.  on the other hand, artists such  as Jonathan Monaghan make a feature of the white  surface that is integral to the piece.  The truth is that until it is possible to print multiple  materials together, such as metal and plastic, or at  least until the tolerances are more controllable and  material developments have progressed to the stage  where several machines can print individual parts in  different materials for final assembly, a much greater  uptake of the technology in the field of the visual arts  is just not going to take place.  Before I move onto the benefits that I believe that  3D printing will bring in the future, we also need to  cover the other downside of the current technology  – software and the way that users interface with it. I  think this is one of the barriers that will always inhibit  the technology being universal for all.  When I first taught art students over thirty years  ago  I  used  to  divide  students  into  groups  of  2D  thinkers  and  3D  thinkers  to  assist  them  in  their  future  career  choices.  In  simple  terms,  I  divided  them into painting or sculpture students. Unless you  can actually think in 3D, you cannot visualise in 3D.  So, for example, if you can’t see in your mind what’s  hidden behind a table or a block of wood, you won’t  be able to draw it. It is about looking at the table and  knowing there is a leg at the back of the table even  though you cannot see it.  158  9781474248679_txt_app.indb   158  9 26 17   3:57 PM   If you can’t think your way through this, then you  will  struggle  to  work  in  CAD.  In  addition,  you  also  have to learn the software and at the moment this  requires learning not just one programme but several,  and  each  has  their  own  difficulties  and  interface  quirks  from  the  user  perspective.  This  will  change  because most of the software is currently morphing  to adopt all of the features that are offered by each  of the individual programmes at the moment. In the  future, there will probably be just one or two standard  software solutions.  The obvious solution to the software problem is  that you will just download the file from the likes of  TurboSquid  or  Thingverse   web  services  where  you  can  purchase  or  download  cheap  premade  files .  However,  this  removes  the  big  advantage  of  3D  printing,  which  is  the  ability  to  print  an  individual  product  tailored  to  your  personal  requirements  without  the  need  to  tool  up  for  mass  production  beyond the ability to create the individual file.  To  turn  to  the  positives  for  the  future,  the  gestation for this second edition has now been five  years. At the start I wrote that the future predicted  by the popular press was unrealistic and would not  develop as quickly as some assumed. Five years on  and  the  material  technology  has  moved  rapidly  in  research terms. But we are still in the early stages of  the technology, and I am now constantly revising my  expectations of this disruptive technology.  In  2001  at  the  CFPR  we  had  been  trialling  the  printing  of  a  cellulose  nano-material  derived  from   vegetable waste that had the potential to be stronger  than  steel,  but  biodegradable.  We  printed  ceramic  microbial  fuel  cells  that  used  human  waste  as  the  energy  for  the  battery,  and  the  microbes  produced  clean  water  at  the  end.  In  2017  we  are  trialling  random  analogue  attributes  to  create  individual  pieces. All of these are a big leap from the ‘straight’  3D-printed ceramic tableware and printing for artists  where we began.  In  summary,  I  think  that  3D  printing  technology  has  enormous  potential  for  the  visual  arts  and  undeniably it will influence our future. I return to the  fact that I do not know what that future will look like,  except that possibly a lot of it will be 3D printed. I am  also  heartened  by  the  increasing  return  to  making  and understanding of craft skills, some of which will  be a definite backlash against 3D printing and digital  technologies. This will be similar to the resurgence of  letterpress against digital 2D printing technologies,  such  as  Yeehaw  Industries  and  Cannonball  Press.  What  I  am  beginning  to  see  is  the  merging  of  analogue  and  digital  thinking,  where  the  digital  is  subservient to the analogue and physical. So we will  end up with a new craft of the digital, where skilled  creative  practitioners  will  use  3D  printing  where  necessary and analogue techniques where they are  particularly relevant.  1  3ders  2012 , ‘3D Printing Identified in Gartner’s 2012 Hype Cycle for emerging  Technology’, 17 August.
