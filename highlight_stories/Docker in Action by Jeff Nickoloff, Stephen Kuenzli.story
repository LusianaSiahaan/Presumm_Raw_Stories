By	reading	this	book, you’re	opening	your	eyes	to	a	new	world	of	tools	that	are forever	changing	the	way	we	build,	deploy,	and	run	software. Once	I	discovered	Docker	in	2014	 the	year	after	it	was	open- sourced 	I	did	something	I	had	never	done	in	my	20+	year career:	I	decided	to	focus	exclusively	on	this	single technology.	That’s	how	much	I	believed	in	what	Docker	was doing	to	make	our	ever-increasing	IT	world	easier	to	manage.  Fast	forward	to	today,	and	what’s	still	unique	about	Docker’s way	of	creating	and	deploying	containers	is	that	it	has	both developers	and	operators	in	mind.	You	can	see	this	in	the	user- experience	of	its	command-line	tools,	and	with	hundreds	of tools	in	the	container	ecosystem,	I	keep	coming	back	to Docker	as	the	easiest	and	smoothest	way	to	get	things	done.  Jeff	and	Stephen	know	this	too	about	Docker’s	streamlined approach	to	containers,	which	is	why	this	book	focuses	on	the details	of	the	core	tools.	Docker	Engine,	Docker	Compose, and	Docker	Swarm	are	key	tools	we	should	all	know.	They often	solve	your	problems	without	the	need	for	more	complex solutions.	This	same	methodology	is	how	I	teach	my	students and	how	I	guide	my	clients.  Containers	couldn’t	have	come	at	a	better	time,	taking	features of	the	Linux	kernel	 and	now	Windows,	ARM,	and	more 	and automating	them	into	accessible	one-line	commands.	Sure,	we   had	container-like	features	for	years	in	Solaris,	FreeBSD,	and then	Linux,	but	it	was	only	the	bravest	sysadmins	who	got those	features	to	work	before	Docker.  Containers	today	are	now	more	than	the	sum	of	their	parts. The	workflow	speed	and	agility	that	a	fully	Dockerized software	lifecycle	gives	a	team	cannot	be	understated.	I’m glad	Jeff	and	Stephen	took	their	battle-hardened	experience and	updated	this	already	great	book	with	new	details	and examples,	and	I’m	confident	you’ll	gain	benefits	by	putting their	recommendations	into	practice.  —BRET	FISHER,	DOCKER	CAPTAIN	AND	CONTAINER CONSULTANT bretfisher.com twitter.com bretfisher   Preface  Docker	and	the	container	community	have	come	a	long	way since	we	started	participating	in	2013.	And	Docker	has changed	in	some	unexpected	ways	since	2016,	when	Jeff released	the	first	edition	of	this	book.	Thankfully,	most	of	the user-facing	interfaces	and	core	concepts	were	maintained	in	a backward-compatible	manner.	The	first	two-thirds	of	the	book needed	updates	only	for	additional	features	or	closed	issues. As	anticipated,	part	3	of	the	previous	edition	needed	a	full rewrite.	Since	publication	of	the	previous	book,	we’ve	seen progress	in	orchestration,	app	connectivity,	proprietary	cloud container	offerings,	multicontainer	app	packaging,	and function-as-a-service	platforms.	This	edition	focuses	on	the fundamental	concepts	and	practices	for	using	Docker containers	and	steers	clear	of	rapidly	changing	technologies that	complement	Docker.  The	biggest	change	is	the	development	and	adoption	of	several container	orchestrators.	The	primary	purpose	of	a	container orchestrator	is	to	run	applications	modeled	as	services	across	a cluster	of	hosts.	Kubernetes,	the	most	famous	of	these orchestrators,	has	seen	significant	adoption	and	gained	support from	every	major	technology	vendor.	The	Cloud	Native Computing	Foundation	was	formed	around	that	project,	and	if you	ask	them,	a	“cloud	native”	app	is	one	designed	for deployment	on	Kubernetes.	But	it	is	important	not	to	get	too caught	up	in	the	marketing	or	the	specific	orchestration technology.	This	book	does	not	cover	Kubernetes	for	two   reasons.  While	Kubernetes	is	included	with	Docker	for	Desktop,	it	is massive	and	in	constant	flux.	It	could	never	be	covered	at	any depth	in	a	handful	of	chapters	or	even	in	a	book	with	fewer than	400	pages.	A	wealth	of	excellent	resources	are	available online	as	well	as	wonderful	published	books	on	Kubernetes. We	wanted	to	focus	on	the	big	idea—service	orchestration—in this	book	without	getting	too	lost	in	the	nuances.  Second,	Docker	ships	with	Swarm	clustering	and	orchestration included.	That	system	is	more	than	adequate	for	smaller clusters,	or	clusters	in	edge	computing	environments.	A	huge number	of	organizations	are	happily	using	Swarm	every	day. Swarm	is	great	for	people	getting	started	with	orchestration and	containers	at	the	same	time.	Most	of	the	tooling	and	ideas carry	over	from	containers	to	services	with	ease.	Application developers	will	likely	benefit	the	most	from	this	approach. System	administrators	or	cluster	operations	personnel	might	be disappointed,	or	might	find	that	Swarm	meets	their	needs.	But, we’re	not	sure	they’ll	ever	find	a	long-form	written	resource that	will	satisfy	their	needs.  The	next	biggest	change	is	that	Docker	runs	everywhere	today. Docker	for	Desktop	is	well	integrated	for	use	on	Apple	and Microsoft	operating	systems.	It	hides	the	underlying	virtual machine	from	users.	For	the	most	part,	this	is	a	success;	on macOS,	the	experience	is	nearly	seamless.	On	Windows, things	seem	to	go	well	at	least	for	a	few	moments.	Windows users	will	deal	with	an	intimidating	number	of	configuration variations	from	corporate	firewalls,	aggressive	antivirus   configuration,	shell	preferences,	and	several	layers	of indirection.	That	variation	makes	delivering	written	content for	Windows	impossible.	Any	attempt	to	do	so	would	age	out before	the	material	went	to	production.	For	that	reason,	we’ve again	limited	the	included	syntax	and	system-specific	material to	Linux	and	macOS.	A	reader	just	might	find	that	all	the examples	actually	run	in	their	environment,	but	we	can’t promise	that	they	will	or	reasonably	help	guide troubleshooting	efforts.  Next,	getting	an	internet-attached	virtual	machine	with	Docker installed	has	become	trivial.	Every	major	and	minor	cloud provider	offers	as	much.	For	that	reason,	we’ve	removed material	pertaining	to	Docker	Machine	and	installing	Docker. We’re	confident	that	our	readers	will	be	able	to	find installation	instructions	that	are	most	appropriate	for	the platform	of	their	choice.	And	today,	they	might	even	skip	that step	and	adopt	one	of	the	many	container-first	cloud	platforms like	AWS	ECS.	This	book	won’t	cover	those	platforms. They’re	each	unique	enough	to	be	difficult	to	discuss	in aggregate.	And	all	of	them	have	put	significant	effort	into	their adoption	stories	and	documentation.  Finally,	containers	and	networking	have	had	a	complicated history.	In	the	last	few	years,	that	story	became	just	a	little	bit more	complicated	with	the	emergence	of	service	mesh platforms	and	other	complementary	technologies.	A	service mesh	is	a	platform	of	application-aware	smart	pipes	that provide	microservice	networking	best	practices	out	of	the	box. They	use	proxies	to	provide	point-to-point	encryption, authentication,	authorization,	circuit-breakers,	and	advanced   request	routing.	The	container	networking	fundamentals presented	in	this	book	should	prove	useful	in	understanding and	evaluating	service	mesh	technologies.  This	book	is	intended	as	a	deep	introduction	to	the fundamentals	of	working	with	Docker.	A	reader	might	not learn	everything	that	they	need	in	their	daily	application	of	this technology.	But	they	will	have	the	fundamental	skillset required	to	learn	advanced	topics	more	quickly	and	further those	pursuits.	We	wish	you	the	best	of	luck	in	those containerized	ventures.   Acknowledgments  We	would	like	to	thank	Manning	Publications	for	the opportunity	to	write	this	book;	the	generous	help	from	our editors,	particularly	Jennifer	Stout;	and	feedback	from	all	of our	reviewers:	Andy	Wiesendanger,	Borko	Djurkovic,	Carlos Curotto,	Casey	Burnett,	Chris	Phillips,	Christian	Kreutzer- Beck,	Christopher	Phillips,	David	Knepprath,	Dennis	Reil, Des	Horsley,	Ernesto	Cárdenas	Cangahuala,	Ethan	Rivett, Georgios	Doumas,	Gerd	Klevesaat,	Giuseppe	Caruso,	Kelly	E.

Jeff	Nickoloff:	A	second	edition	is	a	burden	and	an opportunity.	It	is	the	same	burden	any	SaaS	owner	feels. People	are	consuming	your	work,	and,	ultimately,	you’re	in some	small	part	responsible	for	their	success	or	failure.	I	took on	this	work	knowing	that	it	needed	to	be	done,	but	also	that	I would	struggle	without	a	coauthor.	It	is	an	opportunity	to continue	sharing	what	I	know	with	the	world,	but	more importantly	an	opportunity	to	introduce	and	share	Stephen Kuenzli’s	knowledge.	He	and	I	have	had	several	opportunities to	work	together	in	Phoenix,	including	co-organizing DevOpsDays,	running	the	Docker	PHX	meetup,	and	bouncing a	constant	stream	of	ideas	off	each	other.  Since	2013,	I’ve	watched	and	helped	countless	people	and teams	work	through	their	container	and	cloud	adoption	stories.   I	learn	something	new	from	each	encounter,	and	it	is	safe	to say	that	I	would	not	be	where	I	am	today	if	it	were	not	for	their willingness	to	include	me.  A	huge	portion	of	the	engineers	who	shaped	my	insight	into Docker	have	since	moved	on	to	different	companies,	projects, and	passions.	I’m	thankful	for	their	continued	insight	into	that new	and	diverse	spectrum	of	challenges	and	technology.  Portia	Dean	has	been	an	invaluable	partner.	Without	her willingness	to	choose	the	challenging	and	rewarding	paths,	I wouldn’t	have	these	books,	our	companies,	or	the	same	degree of	personal	fulfillment.	We	can	accomplish	anything	together.  Finally,	I	want	to	acknowledge	my	parents,	Jeff	and	Kathy,	for their	early	and	ongoing	support	and	encouragement.  Stephen	Kuenzli:	Writing	a	book	is	a	great	challenge	and responsibility.	I	learned	a	large	portion	of	my	practical professional	skills	from	technical	books	like	this	one	after graduating	with	an	engineering	degree.	That	knowledge	and those	skills	have	been	central	to	my	career,	and	I	appreciate that	gift	of	knowledge.	When	Jeff	asked	me	to	help	him	update Docker	in	Action,	I	was	excited	and	frightened.	Here	was	an opportunity	to	expand	and	improve	on	a	successful	work	by sharing	knowledge	I’d	gained	over	the	past	several	years building	systems	with	Docker.	My	main	motivation	was	to help	people	along	their	own	development	paths.	I	knew	this would	be	challenging	and	require	tremendous	discipline. Indeed,	authoring	the	second	edition	surpassed	my	imagined effort,	and	I	am	proud	of	what	we	have	produced.   Every	significant	work	requires	assistance	and	support	from people	around	the	creators.	I	would	like	to	thank	the	following people	who	made	this	book	a	success:  My	coauthor,	Jeff	Nickoloff,	for	the	opportunity	to	collaborate	on	this work	and	learn	how	to	write.  My	wife,	Jen,	for	her	patience	and	the	quiet	time	required	to	actually	write this	book.	Our	son,	William,	for	constantly	reminding	me	of	the	joy	in	life and	inspiring	me	to	do	my	best.  Docker,	for	building	a	great	tool	and	community.  Everyone	who	taught	and	gave	me	the	opportunities	needed	to	get	to	this point.  And	thanks	to	all	of	you	reading	this	book.	I	hope	you	find	this book	useful	and	that	it	helps	you	grow	your	career.   About	the	cover	illustration  The	figure	on	the	cover	of	Docker	in	Action	is	captioned	“The Angler.”	The	illustration	is	taken	from	a	nineteenth-century collection	of	works	by	many	artists,	edited	by	Louis	Curmer and	published	in	Paris	in	1841.	The	title	of	the	collection	is Les	Français	peints	par	eux-mêmes,	which	translates	as	The French	People	Painted	by	Themselves.	Each	illustration	is finely	drawn	and	colored	by	hand,	and	the	rich	variety	of drawings	in	the	collection	reminds	us	vividly	of	how	culturally apart	the	world’s	regions,	towns,	villages,	and	neighborhoods were	just	200	years	ago.	Isolated	from	each	other,	people spoke	different	dialects	and	languages.	In	the	streets	or	in	the countryside,	it	was	easy	to	identify	where	they	lived	and	what their	trade	or	station	in	life	was	just	by	their	dress.  Dress	codes	have	changed	since	then	and	the	diversity	by region,	so	rich	at	the	time,	has	faded	away.	It	is	now	hard	to tell	apart	the	inhabitants	of	different	continents,	let	alone different	towns	or	regions.	Perhaps	we	have	traded	cultural diversity	for	a	more	varied	personal	life—certainly	for	a	more varied	and	fast-paced	technological	life.  At	a	time	when	it	is	hard	to	tell	one	computer	book	from another,	Manning	celebrates	the	inventiveness	and	initiative	of the	computer	business	with	book	covers	based	on	the	rich diversity	of	regional	life	of	two	centuries	ago,	brought	back	to life	by	pictures	from	collections	such	as	this	one.   About	this	book  Docker	in	Action’s	purpose	is	to	introduce	developers,	system administrators,	and	other	computer	users	of	a	mixed	skillset	to the	Docker	project	and	Linux	container	concepts.	Both	Docker and	Linux	are	open	source	projects	with	a	wealth	of	online documentation,	but	getting	started	with	either	can	be	a daunting	task.  Docker	is	one	of	the	fastest-growing	open	source	projects ever,	and	the	ecosystem	that	has	grown	around	it	is	evolving	at a	similar	pace.	For	these	reasons,	this	book	focuses	on	the Docker	toolset	exclusively.	This	restriction	of	scope	should both	help	the	material	age	well	and	help	readers	understand how	to	apply	Docker	features	to	their	specific	use-cases. Readers	will	be	prepared	to	tackle	bigger	problems	and explore	the	ecosystem	once	they	develop	a	solid	grasp	of	the fundamentals	covered	in	this	book.   ROADMAP  This	book	is	split	into	three	parts.  Part	1	introduces	Docker	and	container	features.	Reading	it will	help	you	understand	how	to	install	and	uninstall	software distributed	with	Docker.	You’ll	learn	how	to	run,	manage,	and link	different	kinds	of	software	in	different	container configurations.	Part	1	covers	the	basic	skillset	that	every Docker	user	will	need.  Part	2	is	focused	on	packaging	and	distributing	software	with Docker.	It	covers	the	underlying	mechanics	of	Docker	images, nuances	in	file	sizes,	and	a	survey	of	different	packaging	and distribution	methods.	This	part	wraps	up	with	a	deep	dive	into the	Docker	Distribution	project.  Part	3	explores	multicontainer	projects	and	multihost environments.	This	includes	coverage	of	the	Docker	Compose and	Swarm	projects.	These	chapters	walk	you	through building	and	deploying	multiple	real	world	examples	that should	closely	resemble	large-scale	server	software	you’d	find in	the	wild.   CODE	CONVENTIONS	AND	DOWNLOADS  This	book	is	about	a	multipurpose	tool,	and	so	there	is	very little	“code”	included	in	the	book.	In	its	place	are	hundreds	of shell	commands	and	configuration	files.	These	are	typically provided	in	POSIX-compliant	syntax.	Notes	for	Windows users	are	provided	where	Docker	exposes	some	Windows- specific	features.	Care	was	taken	to	break	up	commands	into multiple	lines	in	order	to	improve	readability	or	clarify annotations.

No prior	knowledge	of	Docker	Hub	or	GitHub	is	required	to	run the	examples.  This	book	uses	several	open	source	projects	to	both demonstrate	various	features	of	Docker	and	help	the	reader shift	software-management	paradigms.	No	single	software “stack”	or	family	is	highlighted	other	than	Docker	itself. Working	through	the	examples,	the	reader	will	use	tools	such as	WordPress,	Elasticsearch,	Postgres,	shell	scripts,	Netcat, Flask,	JavaScript,	NGINX,	and	Java.	The	sole	commonality	is a	dependency	on	the	Linux	kernel.

Welcome	to	Docker  This	chapter	covers  What	Docker	is  Example:	“Hello,	World”  An	introduction	to	containers  How	Docker	addresses	software	problems	that	most	people	tolerate  When,	where,	and	why	you	should	use	Docker  A	best	practice	is	an	optional	investment	in	your	product	or system	that	should	yield	better	outcomes	in	the	future.	Best practices	enhance	security,	prevent	conflicts,	improve serviceability,	or	increase	longevity.	Best	practices	often	need advocates	because	justifying	the	immediate	cost	can	be difficult.	This	is	especially	so	when	the	future	of	the	system	or product	is	uncertain.	Docker	is	a	tool	that	makes	adopting software	packaging,	distribution,	and	utilization	best	practices cheap	and	sensible	defaults.	It	does	so	by	providing	a	complete vision	for	process	containers	and	simple	tooling	for	building and	working	with	them.  If	you’re	on	a	team	that	operates	service	software	with dynamic	scaling	requirements,	deploying	software	with Docker	can	help	reduce	customer	impact.	Containers	come	up more	quickly	and	consume	fewer	resources	than	virtual machines.  Teams	that	use	continuous	integration	and	continuous   deployment	techniques	can	build	more	expressive	pipelines and	create	more	robust	functional	testing	environments	if	they use	Docker.	The	containers	being	tested	hold	the	same software	that	will	go	to	production.	The	results	are	higher production	change	confidence,	tighter	production	change control,	and	faster	iteration.  If	your	team	uses	Docker	to	model	local	development environments,	you	will	decrease	member	onboarding	time	and eliminate	the	inconsistencies	that	slow	you	down.	Those	same environments	can	be	version	controlled	with	the	software	and updated	as	the	software	requirements	change.  Software	authors	usually	know	how	to	install	and	configure their	software	with	sensible	defaults	and	required dependencies.	If	you	write	software,	distributing	that	software with	Docker	will	make	it	easier	for	your	users	to	install	and run	it.	They	will	be	able	to	leverage	the	default	configuration and	helper	material	that	you	include.	If	you	use	Docker,	you can	reduce	your	product	“Installation	Guide”	to	a	single command	and	a	single	portable	dependency.  Whereas	software	authors	understand	dependencies, installation,	and	packaging,	it	is	system	administrators	who understand	the	systems	where	the	software	will	run.	Docker provides	an	expressive	language	for	running	software	in containers.	That	language	lets	system	administrators	inject environment-specific	configuration	and	tightly	control	access to	system	resources.	That	same	language,	coupled	with	built-in package	management,	tooling,	and	distribution	infrastructure, makes	deployments	declarative,	repeatable,	and	trustworthy.	It   promotes	disposable	system	paradigms,	persistent	state isolation,	and	other	best	practices	that	help	system administrators	focus	on	higher-value	activities.  Launched	in	March	2013,	Docker	works	with	your	operating system	to	package,	ship,	and	run	software.	You	can	think	of Docker	as	a	software	logistics	provider	that	will	save	you	time and	let	you	focus	on	core	competencies.	You	can	use	Docker with	network	applications	such	as	web	servers,	databases,	and mail	servers,	and	with	terminal	applications	including	text editors,	compilers,	network	analysis	tools,	and	scripts;	in	some cases,	it’s	even	used	to	run	GUI	applications	such	as	web browsers	and	productivity	software.  Docker	runs	Linux	software	on	most	systems.	Docker	for	Mac and	Docker	for	Windows	integrate	with	common	virtual machine	 VM 	technology	to	create	portability	with	Windows and	macOS.	But	Docker	can	run	native	Windows	applications on	modern	Windows	server	machines.  Docker	isn’t	a	programming	language,	and	it	isn’t	a framework	for	building	software.	Docker	is	a	tool	that	helps solve	common	problems	such	as	installing,	removing, upgrading,	distributing,	trusting,	and	running	software.	It’s open	source	Linux	software,	which	means	that	anyone	can contribute	to	it	and	that	it	has	benefited	from	a	variety	of perspectives.	It’s	common	for	companies	to	sponsor	the development	of	open	source	projects.	In	this	case,	Docker	Inc. is	the	primary	sponsor.	You	can	find	out	more	about	Docker Inc.	at	https:  docker.com company .   1.1.	WHAT	IS	DOCKER?  If	you’re	picking	up	this	book,	you	have	probably	already heard	of	Docker.	Docker	is	an	open	source	project	for building,	shipping,	and	running	programs.	It	is	a	command- line	program,	a	background	process,	and	a	set	of	remote services	that	take	a	logistical	approach	to	solving	common software	problems	and	simplifying	your	experience	installing, running,	publishing,	and	removing	software.	It	accomplishes this	by	using	an	operating	system	technology	called containers.  1.1.1.	“Hello,	World”  This	topic	is	easier	to	learn	with	a	concrete	example.	In keeping	with	tradition,	we’ll	use	“Hello,	World.”	Before	you begin,	download	and	install	Docker	for	your	system.	Detailed instructions	are	kept	up-to-date	for	every	available	system	at https:  docs.docker.com install .	Once	you	have	Docker installed	and	an	active	internet	connection,	head	to	your command	prompt	and	type	the	following:  docker	run	dockerinaction hello_world  After	you	do	so,	Docker	will	spring	to	life.	It	will	start downloading	various	components	and	eventually	print	out "hello	world".	If	you	run	it	again,	it	will	just	print	out "hello	world".	Several	things	are	happening	in	this example,	and	the	command	itself	has	a	few	distinct	parts.   First,	you	use	the	docker	run	command.	This	tells	Docker that	you	want	to	trigger	the	sequence	 shown	in	figure	1.1 	that installs	and	runs	a	program	inside	a	container.  Figure	1.1.	What	happens	after	running	docker	run  The	second	part	specifies	the	program	that	you	want	Docker	to run	in	a	container.	In	this	example,	that	program	is dockerinaction hello_world.	This	is	called	the image	 or	repository 	name.	For	now,	you	can	think	of	the image	name	as	the	name	of	the	program	you	want	to	install	or run.	The	image	itself	is	a	collection	of	files	and	metadata.	That metadata	includes	the	specific	program	to	execute	and	other relevant	configuration	details.  Note  This	repository	and	several	others	were	created	specifically	to support	the	examples	in	this	book.	By	the	end	of	part	2,	you should	feel	comfortable	examining	these	open	source examples.   The	first	time	you	run	this	command,	Docker	has	to	figure	out whether	the	docker-inaction hello_world	image has	already	been	downloaded.	If	it’s	unable	to	locate	it	on	your computer	 because	it’s	the	first	thing	you	do	with	Docker , Docker	makes	a	call	to	Docker	Hub.	Docker	Hub	is	a	public registry	provided	by	Docker	Inc.	Docker	Hub	replies	to Docker	running	on	your	computer	to	indicate	where	the	image  docker-inaction hello_world 	can	be	found,	and Docker	starts	the	download.  Once	the	image	is	installed,	Docker	creates	a	new	container and	runs	a	single	command.	In	this	case,	the	command	is simple:  echo	"hello	world"  After	the	echo	command	prints	"hello	world"	to	the terminal,	the	program	exits,	and	the	container	is	marked	as stopped.	Understand	that	the	running	state	of	a	container	is directly	tied	to	the	state	of	a	single	running	program	inside	the container.	If	a	program	is	running,	the	container	is	running.	If the	program	is	stopped,	the	container	is	stopped.	Restarting	a container	will	run	the	program	again.  When	you	give	the	command	a	second	time,	Docker	will check	again	to	see	whether	docker- inaction hello_world	is	installed.	This	time	it	will find	the	image	on	the	local	machine	and	can	build	another container	and	execute	it	right	away.	We	want	to	emphasize	an important	detail.	When	you	use	docker	run	the	second time,	it	creates	a	second	container	from	the	same	repository    figure	1.2	illustrates	this .	This	means	that	if	you	repeatedly use	docker	run	and	create	a	bunch	of	containers,	you’ll need	to	get	a	list	of	the	containers	you’ve	created	and	maybe	at some	point	destroy	them.	Working	with	containers	is	as straightforward	as	creating	them,	and	both	topics	are	covered in	chapter	2.  Figure	1.2.	Running	docker	run	a	second	time.	Because	the	image	is	already	installed,	Docker can	start	the	new	container	right	away.  Congratulations!	You’re	now	an	official	Docker	user.	Using Docker	is	just	this	easy.	But	it	can	test	your	understanding	of the	application	you	are	running.	Consider	running	a	web application	in	a	container.	If	you	did	not	know	that	it	was	a long-running	application	that	listened	for	inbound	network communication	on	TCP	port	80,	you	might	not	know	exactly what	Docker	command	should	be	used	to	start	that	container. These	are	the	types	of	sticking	points	people	encounter	as	they migrate	to	containers.  Although	this	book	cannot	speak	to	the	needs	of	your	specific applications,	it	does	identify	the	common	use	cases	and	help teach	most	relevant	Docker	use	patterns.	By	the	end	of	part	1, you	should	have	a	strong	command	of	containers	with	Docker.  1.1.2.	Containers  Historically,	UNIX-style	operating	systems	have	used	the	term jail	to	describe	a	modified	runtime	environment	that	limits	the   scope	of	resources	that	a	jailed	program	can	access.	Jail features	go	back	to	1979	and	have	been	in	evolution	ever since.	In	2005,	with	the	release	of	Sun’s	Solaris	10	and	Solaris Containers,	container	has	become	the	preferred	term	for	such a	runtime	environment.	The	goal	has	expanded	from	limiting filesystem	scope	to	isolating	a	process	from	all	resources except	where	explicitly	allowed.  Using	containers	has	been	a	best	practice	for	a	long	time.	But manually	building	containers	can	be	challenging	and	easy	to do	incorrectly.	This	challenge	has	put	them	out	of	reach	for some.	Others	using	misconfigured	containers	are	lulled	into	a false	sense	of	security.	This	was	a	problem	begging	to	be solved,	and	Docker	helps.	Any	software	run	with	Docker	is run	inside	a	container.	Docker	uses	existing	container	engines to	provide	consistent	containers	built	according	to	best practices.	This	puts	stronger	security	within	reach	for everyone.  With	Docker,	users	get	containers	at	a	much	lower	cost. Running	the	example	in	section	1.1.1	uses	a	container	and does	not	require	any	special	knowledge.	As	Docker	and	its container	engines	improve,	you	get	the	latest	and	greatest isolation	features.	Instead	of	keeping	up	with	the	rapidly evolving	and	highly	technical	world	of	building	strong containers,	you	can	let	Docker	handle	the	bulk	of	that	for	you.  1.1.3.	Containers	are	not	virtualization  In	this	cloud-native	era,	people	tend	to	think	about	virtual machines	as	units	of	deployment,	where	deploying	a	single   process	means	creating	a	whole	network-attached	virtual machine.	Virtual	machines	provide	virtual	hardware	 or hardware	on	which	an	operating	system	and	other	programs can	be	installed .	They	take	a	long	time	 often	minutes 	to create	and	require	significant	resource	overhead	because	they run	a	whole	operating	system	in	addition	to	the	software	you want	to	use.	Virtual	machines	can	perform	optimally	once everything	is	up	and	running,	but	the	startup	delays	make	them a	poor	fit	for	just-in-time	or	reactive	deployment	scenarios.  Unlike	virtual	machines,	Docker	containers	don’t	use	any hardware	virtualization.	Programs	running	inside	Docker containers	interface	directly	with	the	host’s	Linux	kernel. Many	programs	can	run	in	isolation	without	running	redundant operating	systems	or	suffering	the	delay	of	full	boot sequences.	This	is	an	important	distinction.	Docker	is	not	a hardware	virtualization	technology.	Instead,	it	helps	you	use the	container	technology	already	built	into	your	operating system	kernel.  Virtual	machines	provide	hardware	abstractions	so	you	can run	operating	systems.	Containers	are	an	operating	system feature.	So	you	can	always	run	Docker	in	a	virtual	machine	if that	machine	is	running	a	modern	Linux	kernel.	Docker	for Mac	and	Windows	users,	and	almost	all	cloud	computing users,	will	run	Docker	inside	virtual	machines.	So	these	are really	complementary	technologies.  1.1.4.	Running	software	in	containers	for	isolation  Containers	and	isolation	features	have	existed	for	decades.   Docker	uses	Linux	namespaces	and	cgroups,	which	have	been part	of	Linux	since	2007.	Docker	doesn’t	provide	the	container technology,	but	it	specifically	makes	it	simpler	to	use.	To understand	what	containers	look	like	on	a	system,	let’s	first establish	a	baseline.	Figure	1.3	shows	a	basic	example	running on	a	simplified	computer	system	architecture.  Figure	1.3.	A	basic	computer	stack	running	two	programs	that	were	started	from	the	command lin  Notice	that	the	command-line	interface,	or	CLI,	runs	in	what	is called	user	space	memory,	just	like	other	programs	that	run	on top	of	the	operating	system.	Ideally,	programs	running	in	user space	can’t	modify	kernel	space	memory.	Broadly	speaking, the	operating	system	is	the	interface	between	all	user	programs and	the	hardware	that	the	computer	is	running	on.  You	can	see	in	figure	1.4	that	running	Docker	means	running two	programs	in	user	space.	The	first	is	the	Docker	engine.	If installed	properly,	this	process	should	always	be	running.	The second	is	the	Docker	CLI.	This	is	the	Docker	program	that users	interact	with.	If	you	want	to	start,	stop,	or	install software,	you’ll	issue	a	command	by	using	the	Docker program.   Figure	1.4.	Docker	running	three	containers	on	a	basic	Linux	computer	system  Figure	1.4	also	shows	three	running	containers.	Each	is running	as	a	child	process	of	the	Docker	engine,	wrapped	with a	container,	and	the	delegate	process	is	running	in	its	own memory	subspace	of	the	user	space.	Programs	running	inside	a container	can	access	only	their	own	memory	and	resources	as scoped	by	the	container.  Docker	builds	containers	using	10	major	system	features.	Part 1	of	this	book	uses	Docker	commands	to	illustrate	how	these features	can	be	modified	to	suit	the	needs	of	the	contained software	and	to	fit	the	environment	where	the	container	will run.	The	specific	features	are	as	follows:  PID	namespace—	Process	identifiers	and	capabilities  UTS	namespace—	Host	and	domain	name  MNT	namespace—	Filesystem	access	and	structure  IPC	namespace—	Process	communication	over	shared	memory  NET	namespace—	Network	access	and	structure   USR	namespace—	User	names	and	identifiers  chroot	syscall—Controls	the	location	of	the	filesystem	root  cgroups—	Resource	protection  CAP	drop—	Operating	system	feature	restrictions  Security	modules—	Mandatory	access	controls  Docker	uses	those	to	build	containers	at	runtime,	but	it	uses another	set	of	technologies	to	package	and	ship	containers.  1.1.5.	Shipping	containers  You	can	think	of	a	Docker	container	as	a	physical	shipping container.	It’s	a	box	where	you	store	and	run	an	application and	all	of	its	dependencies	 excluding	the	running	operating system	kernel .	Just	as	cranes,	trucks,	trains,	and	ships	can easily	work	with	shipping	containers,	so	can	Docker	run,	copy, and	distribute	containers	with	ease.	Docker	completes	the traditional	container	metaphor	by	including	a	way	to	package and	distribute	software.	The	component	that	fills	the	shipping container	role	is	called	an	image.  The	example	in	section	1.1.1	used	an	image	named dockerinaction hello_world.	That	image	contains single	file:	a	small	executable	Linux	program.	More	generally, a	Docker	image	is	a	bundled	snapshot	of	all	the	files	that should	be	available	to	a	program	running	inside	a	container. You	can	create	as	many	containers	from	an	image	as	you want.	But	when	you	do,	containers	that	were	started	from	the same	image	don’t	share	changes	to	their	filesystem.	When	you distribute	software	with	Docker,	you	distribute	these	images, and	the	receiving	computers	create	containers	from	them.   Images	are	the	shippable	units	in	the	Docker	ecosystem.  Docker	provides	a	set	of	infrastructure	components	that simplify	distributing	Docker	images.	These	components	are registries	and	indexes.	You	can	use	publicly	available infrastructure	provided	by	Docker	Inc.,	other	hosting companies,	or	your	own	registries	and	indexes.   1.2.	WHAT	PROBLEMS	DOES	DOCKER	SOLVE?  Using	software	is	complex.	Before	installation,	you	have	to consider	the	operating	system	you’re	using,	the	resources	the software	requires,	what	other	software	is	already	installed,	and what	other	software	it	depends	on.	You	need	to	decide	where it	should	be	installed.	Then	you	need	to	know	how	to	install	it. It’s	surprising	how	drastically	installation	processes	vary today.	The	list	of	considerations	is	long	and	unforgiving. Installing	software	is	at	best	inconsistent	and	overcomplicated. The	problem	is	only	worsened	if	you	want	to	make	sure	that several	machines	use	a	consistent	set	of	software	over	time.  Package	managers	such	as	APT,	Homebrew,	YUM,	and	npm attempt	to	manage	this,	but	few	of	those	provide	any	degree	of isolation.	Most	computers	have	more	than	one	application installed	and	running.	And	most	applications	have dependencies	on	other	software.	What	happens	when applications	you	want	to	use	don’t	play	well	together? Disaster!	Things	are	only	made	more	complicated	when applications	share	dependencies:  What	happens	if	one	application	needs	an	upgraded	dependency,	but	the other	does	not?  What	happens	when	you	remove	an	application?	Is	it	really	gone?  Can	you	remove	old	dependencies?  Can	you	remember	all	the	changes	you	had	to	make	to	install	the	software you	now	want	to	remove?  The	truth	is	that	the	more	software	you	use,	the	more	difficult   it	is	to	manage.	Even	if	you	can	spend	the	time	and	energy required	to	figure	out	installing	and	running	applications,	how confident	can	you	be	about	your	security?	Open	and	closed source	programs	release	security	updates	continually,	and being	aware	of	all	the	issues	is	often	impossible.	The	more software	you	run,	the	greater	the	risk	that	it’s	vulnerable	to attack.  Even	enterprise-grade	service	software	must	be	deployed	with dependencies.	It	is	common	for	those	projects	to	be	shipped with	and	deployed	to	machines	with	hundreds,	if	not thousands,	of	files	and	other	programs.	Each	of	those	creates	a new	opportunity	for	conflict,	vulnerability,	or	licensing liability.  All	of	these	issues	can	be	solved	with	careful	accounting, management	of	resources,	and	logistics,	but	those	are mundane	and	unpleasant	things	to	deal	with.	Your	time	would be	better	spent	using	the	software	that	you’re	trying	to	install, upgrade,	or	publish.	The	people	who	built	Docker	recognized that,	and	thanks	to	their	hard	work,	you	can	breeze	through	the solutions	with	minimal	effort	in	almost	no	time	at	all.  It’s	possible	that	most	of	these	issues	seem	acceptable	today. Maybe	they	feel	trivial	because	you’re	used	to	them.	After reading	how	Docker	makes	these	issues	approachable,	you may	notice	a	shift	in	your	opinion.  1.2.1.	Getting	organized  Without	Docker,	a	computer	can	end	up	looking	like	a	junk   drawer.	Applications	have	all	sorts	of	dependencies.	Some applications	depend	on	specific	system	libraries	for	common things	like	sound,	networking,	graphics,	and	so	on.	Others depend	on	standard	libraries	for	the	language	they’re	written in.	Some	depend	on	other	applications,	such	as	the	way	a	Java program	depends	on	the	Java	Virtual	Machine,	or	a	web application	might	depend	on	a	database.	It’s	common	for	a running	program	to	require	exclusive	access	to	a	scarce resource	such	as	a	network	connection	or	a	file.  Today,	without	Docker,	applications	are	spread	all	over	the filesystem	and	end	up	creating	a	messy	web	of	interactions. Figure	1.5	illustrates	how	example	applications	depend	on example	libraries	without	Docker.  Figure	1.5.	Dependency	relationships	of	example	programs  In	contrast,	the	example	in	section	1.1.1	installed	the	required software	automatically,	and	that	same	software	can	be	reliably removed	with	a	single	command.	Docker	keeps	things organized	by	isolating	everything	with	containers	and	images.  Figure	1.6	illustrates	these	same	applications	and	their dependencies	running	inside	containers.	With	the	links	broken   and	each	application	neatly	contained,	understanding	the system	is	an	approachable	task.	At	first	it	seems	like	this would	introduce	storage	overhead	by	creating	redundant copies	of	common	dependencies	such	as	gcc.	Chapter	3 describes	how	the	Docker	packaging	system	typically	reduces the	storage	overhead.  Figure	1.6.	Example	programs	running	inside	containers	with	copies	of	their	dependencies  1.2.2.	Improving	portability  Another	software	problem	is	that	an	application’s dependencies	typically	include	a	specific	operating	system. Portability	between	operating	systems	is	a	major	problem	for software	users.	Although	it’s	possible	to	have	compatibility between	Linux	software	and	macOS,	using	that	same	software on	Windows	can	be	more	difficult.	Doing	so	can	require building	whole	ported	versions	of	the	software.	Even	that	is possible	only	if	suitable	replacement	dependencies	exist	for Windows.	This	represents	a	major	effort	for	the	maintainers	of the	application	and	is	frequently	skipped.	Unfortunately	for users,	a	whole	wealth	of	powerful	software	is	too	difficult	or impossible	to	use	on	their	system.   At	present,	Docker	runs	natively	on	Linux	and	comes	with	a single	virtual	machine	for	macOS	and	Windows	environments. This	convergence	on	Linux	means	that	software	running	in Docker	containers	need	be	written	only	once	against	a consistent	set	of	dependencies.	You	might	have	just	thought	to yourself,	“Wait	a	minute.	You	just	finished	telling	me	that Docker	is	better	than	virtual	machines.”	That’s	correct,	but they	are	complementary	technologies.	Using	a	virtual	machine to	contain	a	single	program	is	wasteful.	This	is	especially	so when	you’re	running	several	virtual	machines	on	the	same computer.	On	macOS	and	Windows,	Docker	uses	a	single, small	virtual	machine	to	run	all	the	containers.	By	taking	this approach,	the	overhead	of	running	a	virtual	machine	is	fixed, while	the	number	of	containers	can	scale	up.  This	new	portability	helps	users	in	a	few	ways.	First,	it unlocks	a	whole	world	of	software	that	was	previously inaccessible.	Second,	it’s	now	feasible	to	run	the	same software—exactly	the	same	software—on	any	system.	That means	your	desktop,	your	development	environment,	your company’s	server,	and	your	company’s	cloud	can	all	run	the same	programs.	Running	consistent	environments	is important.	Doing	so	helps	minimize	any	learning	curve associated	with	adopting	new	technologies.	It	helps	software developers	better	understand	the	systems	that	will	be	running their	programs.	It	means	fewer	surprises.	Third,	when	software maintainers	can	focus	on	writing	their	programs	for	a	single platform	and	one	set	of	dependencies,	it’s	a	huge	time-saver for	them	and	a	great	win	for	their	customers.  Without	Docker	or	virtual	machines,	portability	is	commonly   achieved	at	an	individual	program	level	by	basing	the	software on	a	common	tool.	For	example,	Java	lets	programmers	write a	single	program	that	will	mostly	work	on	several	operating systems	because	the	programs	rely	on	a	program	called	a	Java Virtual	Machine	 JVM .	Although	this	is	an	adequate	approach while	writing	software,	other	people,	at	other	companies, wrote	most	of	the	software	we	use.	For	example,	if	we	want	to use	a	popular	web	server	that	was	not	written	in	Java	or another	similarly	portable	language,	we	doubt	that	the	authors would	take	time	to	rewrite	it	for	us.	In	addition	to	this shortcoming,	language	interpreters	and	software	libraries	are the	very	things	that	create	dependency	problems.	Docker improves	the	portability	of	every	program	regardless	of	the language	it	was	written	in,	the	operating	system	it	was designed	for,	or	the	state	of	the	environment	where	it’s running.  1.2.3.	Protecting	your	computer  Most	of	what	we’ve	mentioned	so	far	have	been	problems from	the	perspective	of	working	with	software	and	the	benefits of	doing	so	from	outside	a	container.	But	containers	also protect	us	from	the	software	running	inside	a	container.	There are	all	sorts	of	ways	that	a	program	might	misbehave	or present	a	security	risk:  A	program	might	have	been	written	specifically	by	an	attacker.  Well-meaning	developers	could	write	a	program	with	harmful	bugs.  A	program	could	accidentally	do	the	bidding	of	an	attacker	through	bugs in	its	input	handling.  Any	way	you	cut	it,	running	software	puts	the	security	of	your   computer	at	risk.	Because	running	software	is	the	whole	point of	having	a	computer,	it’s	prudent	to	apply	the	practical	risk mitigations.  Like	physical	jail	cells,	anything	inside	a	container	can	access only	things	that	are	inside	it	as	well.	Exceptions	to	this	rule exist,	but	only	when	explicitly	created	by	the	user.	Containers limit	the	scope	of	impact	that	a	program	can	have	on	other running	programs,	the	data	it	can	access,	and	system resources.	Figure	1.7	illustrates	the	difference	between	running software	outside	and	inside	a	container.  Figure	1.7.	Left:	A	malicious	program	with	direct	access	to	sensitive	resources.	Right:	A malicious	program	inside	a	container.  What	this	means	for	you	or	your	business	is	that	the	scope	of any	security	threat	associated	with	running	a	particular application	is	limited	to	the	scope	of	the	application	itself. Creating	strong	application	containers	is	complicated	and	a   critical	component	of	any	in-depth	defense	strategy.	It	is	far too	commonly	skipped	or	implemented	in	a	half-hearted manner.   1.3.	WHY	IS	DOCKER	IMPORTANT?  Docker	provides	an	abstraction.	Abstractions	allow	you	to work	with	complicated	things	in	simplified	terms.	So,	in	the case	of	Docker,	instead	of	focusing	on	all	the	complexities	and specifics	associated	with	installing	an	application,	all	we	need to	consider	is	what	software	we’d	like	to	install.  Like	a	crane	loading	a	shipping	container	onto	a	ship,	the process	of	installing	any	software	with	Docker	is	identical	to any	other.	The	shape	or	size	of	the	thing	inside	the	shipping container	may	vary,	but	the	way	that	the	crane	picks	up	the container	will	always	be	the	same.	All	the	tooling	is	reusable for	any	shipping	container.  This	is	also	the	case	for	application	removal.	When	you	want to	remove	software,	you	simply	tell	Docker	which	software	to remove.	No	lingering	artifacts	will	remain	because	they	were all	contained	and	accounted	for	by	Docker.	Your	computer will	be	as	clean	as	it	was	before	you	installed	the	software.  The	container	abstraction	and	the	tools	Docker	provides	for working	with	containers	has	changed	the	system administration	and	software	development	landscape.	Docker	is important	because	it	makes	containers	available	to	everyone. Using	it	saves	time,	money,	and	energy.  The	second	reason	Docker	is	important	is	that	there	is significant	push	in	the	software	community	to	adopt	containers   and	Docker.	This	push	is	so	strong	that	companies	including Amazon,	Microsoft,	and	Google	have	all	worked	together	to contribute	to	its	development	and	adopt	it	in	their	own	cloud offerings.	These	companies,	which	are	typically	at	odds,	have come	together	to	support	an	open	source	project	instead	of developing	and	releasing	their	own	solutions.  The	third	reason	Docker	is	important	is	that	it	has accomplished	for	the	computer	what	app	stores	did	for	mobile devices.	It	has	made	software	installation, compartmentalization,	and	removal	simple.	Better	yet,	Docker does	it	in	a	cross-platform	and	open	way.	Imagine	if	all	the major	smartphones	shared	the	same	app	store.	That	would	be	a pretty	big	deal.	With	this	technology	in	place,	it’s	possible	that the	lines	between	operating	systems	may	finally	start	to	blur, and	third-party	offerings	will	be	less	of	a	factor	in	choosing	an operating	system.  Fourth,	we’re	finally	starting	to	see	better	adoption	of	some	of the	more	advanced	isolation	features	of	operating	systems. This	may	seem	minor,	but	quite	a	few	people	are	trying	to make	computers	more	secure	through	isolation	at	the	operating system	level.	It’s	been	a	shame	that	their	hard	work	has	taken so	long	to	see	mass	adoption.	Containers	have	existed	for decades	in	one	form	or	another.	It’s	great	that	Docker	helps	us take	advantage	of	those	features	without	all	the	complexity.   1.4.	WHERE	AND	WHEN	TO	USE	DOCKER  Docker	can	be	used	on	most	computers	at	work	and	at	home. Practically,	how	far	should	this	be	taken?  Docker	can	run	almost	anywhere,	but	that	doesn’t	mean	you’ll want	to	do	so.	For	example,	currently	Docker	can	run	only applications	that	can	run	on	a	Linux	operating	system,	or Windows	applications	on	Windows	Server.	If	you	want	to	run a	macOS	or	Windows	native	application	on	your	desktop,	you can’t	yet	do	so	with	Docker.  By	narrowing	the	conversation	to	software	that	typically	runs on	a	Linux	server	or	desktop,	a	solid	case	can	be	made	for running	almost	any	application	inside	a	container.	This includes	server	applications	such	as	web	servers,	mail	servers, databases,	proxies,	and	the	like.	Desktop	software	such	as	web browsers,	word	processors,	email	clients,	or	other	tools	are also	a	great	fit.	Even	trusted	programs	are	as	dangerous	to	run as	a	program	you	downloaded	from	the	internet	if	they	interact with	user-provided	data	or	network	data.	Running	these	in	a container	and	as	a	user	with	reduced	privileges	will	help protect	your	system	from	attack.  Beyond	the	added	in-depth	benefit	of	defense,	using	Docker for	day-to-day	tasks	helps	keep	your	computer	clean.	Keeping a	clean	computer	will	prevent	you	from	running	into	shared resource	issues	and	ease	software	installation	and	removal. That	same	ease	of	installation,	removal,	and	distribution   simplifies	management	of	computer	fleets	and	could	radically change	the	way	companies	think	about	maintenance.  The	most	important	thing	to	remember	is	that	sometimes containers	are	inappropriate.	Containers	won’t	help	much	with the	security	of	programs	that	have	to	run	with	full	access	to	the machine.	At	the	time	of	this	writing,	doing	so	is	possible	but complicated.	Containers	are	not	a	total	solution	for	security issues,	but	they	can	be	used	to	prevent	many	types	of	attacks. Remember,	you	shouldn’t	use	software	from	untrusted sources.	This	is	especially	true	if	that	software	requires administrative	privileges.	That	means	it’s	a	bad	idea	to	blindly run	customer-provided	containers	in	a	co-located	environment.   1.5.	DOCKER	IN	THE	LARGER	ECOSYSTEM  Today	the	greater	container	ecosystem	is	rich	with	tooling	that solves	new	or	higher-level	problems.	Those	problems	include container	orchestration,	high-availability	clustering, microservice	life	cycle	management,	and	visibility.	It	can	be tricky	to	navigate	that	market	without	depending	on	keyword association.	It	is	even	trickier	to	understand	how	Docker	and those	products	work	together.  Those	products	work	with	Docker	in	the	form	of	plugins	or provide	a	certain	higher-level	functionality	and	depend	on Docker.	Some	tools	use	the	Docker	subcomponents.	Those subcomponents	are	independent	projects	such	as	runc, libcontainerd,	and	notary.  Kubernetes	is	the	most	notable	project	in	the	ecosystem	aside from	Docker	itself.	Kubernetes	provides	an	extensible platform	for	orchestrating	services	as	containers	in	clustered environments.	It	is	growing	into	a	sort	of	“datacenter	operating system.”	Like	the	Linux	Kernel,	cloud	providers	and	platform companies	are	packaging	Kubernetes.	Kubernetes	depends	on container	engines	such	as	Docker,	and	so	the	containers	and images	you	build	on	your	laptop	will	run	in	Kubernetes.  You	need	to	consider	several	trade-offs	when	picking	up	any tool.	Kubernetes	draws	power	from	its	extensibility,	but	that comes	at	the	expense	of	its	learning	curve	and	ongoing	support effort.	Today	building,	customizing,	or	extending	Kubernetes   clusters	is	a	full-time	job.	But	using	existing	Kubernetes clusters	to	deploy	your	applications	is	straightforward	with minimal	research.	Most	readers	looking	at	Kubernetes	should consider	adopting	a	managed	offering	from	a	major	public cloud	provider	before	building	their	own.	This	book	focuses on	and	teaches	solutions	to	higher-level	problems	using Docker	alone.	Once	you	understand	what	the	problems	are	and how	to	solve	them	with	one	tool,	you’re	more	likely	to succeed	in	picking	up	more	complicated	tooling.   1.6.	GETTING	HELP	WITH	THE	DOCKER	COMMAND LINE  You’ll	use	the	docker	command-line	program	throughout the	rest	of	this	book.	To	get	you	started	with	that,	we	want	to show	you	how	to	get	information	about	commands	from	the docker	program	itself.	This	way,	you’ll	understand	how	to use	the	exact	version	of	Docker	on	your	computer.	Open	a terminal,	or	command	prompt,	and	run	the	following command:  docker	help  Running	docker	help	will	display	information	about	the basic	syntax	for	using	the	docker	command-line	program	as well	as	a	complete	list	of	commands	for	your	version	of	the program.	Give	it	a	try	and	take	a	moment	to	admire	all	the	neat things	you	can	do.  docker	help	gives	you	only	high-level	information	about what	commands	are	available.	To	get	detailed	information about	a	specific	command,	include	the	command	in	the  	argument.	For	example,	you	might	enter	the following	command	to	find	out	how	to	copy	files	from	a location	inside	a	container	to	a	location	on	the	host	machine:  docker	help	cp  That	will	display	a	usage	pattern	for	docker	cp,	a	general   description	of	what	the	command	does,	and	a	detailed breakdown	of	its	arguments.	We’re	confident	that	you’ll	have a	great	time	working	through	the	commands	introduced	in	the rest	of	this	book	now	that	you	know	how	to	find	help	if	you need	it.   SUMMARY  This	chapter	has	been	a	brief	introduction	to	Docker	and	the problems	it	helps	system	administrators,	developers,	and	other software	users	solve.	In	this	chapter	you	learned	that:  Docker	takes	a	logistical	approach	to	solving	common	software	problems and	simplifies	your	experience	with	installing,	running,	publishing,	and removing	software.	It’s	a	command-line	program,	an	engine	background process,	and	a	set	of	remote	services.	It’s	integrated	with	community	tools provided	by	Docker	Inc.  The	container	abstraction	is	at	the	core	of	its	logistical	approach.  Working	with	containers	instead	of	software	creates	a	consistent	interface and	enables	the	development	of	more	sophisticated	tools.  Containers	help	keep	your	computers	tidy	because	software	inside containers	can’t	interact	with	anything	outside	those	containers,	and	no shared	dependencies	can	be	formed.  Because	Docker	is	available	and	supported	on	Linux,	macOS,	and Windows,	most	software	packaged	in	Docker	images	can	be	used	on	any computer.  Docker	doesn’t	provide	container	technology;	it	hides	the	complexity	of working	directly	with	the	container	software	and	turns	best	practices	into reasonable	defaults.  Docker	works	with	the	greater	container	ecosystem;	that	ecosystem	is	rich with	tooling	that	solves	new	and	higher-level	problems.  If	you	need	help	with	a	command,	you	can	always	consult	the	docker help	subcommand.   Part	1.	Process	isolation	and environment-independent	computing  Isolation	is	a	core	concept	to	so	many	computing	patterns, resource	management	strategies,	and	general	accounting practices	that	it	is	difficult	to	even	begin	compiling	a	list. Someone	who	learns	how	Linux	containers	provide	isolation for	running	programs	and	how	to	use	Docker	to	control	that isolation	can	accomplish	amazing	feats	of	reuse,	resource efficiency,	and	system	simplification.  The	most	difficult	part	of	learning	how	to	apply	containers	is in	translating	the	needs	of	the	software	you	are	trying	to isolate.	Different	programs	have	different	requirements.	Web services	are	different	from	text	editors,	package	managers, compilers,	or	databases.	Containers	for	each	of	those	programs will	need	different	configurations.  This	part	covers	container	configuration	and	operation fundamentals.	It	expands	into	more	detailed	container configurations	to	demonstrate	the	full	spectrum	of	capabilities. For	that	reason,	we	suggest	that	you	try	to	resist	the	urge	to skip	ahead.	It	may	take	some	time	to	get	to	the	specific question	that	is	on	your	mind,	but	we’re	confident	that	you’ll have	more	than	a	few	revelations	along	the	way.   Chapter	2.	Running	software	in containers  This	chapter	covers  Running	interactive	and	daemon	terminal	programs	in	containers  Basic	Docker	operations	and	commands  Isolating	programs	from	each	other	and	injecting	configuration  Running	multiple	programs	in	a	container  Durable	containers	and	the	container	life	cycle  Cleaning	up  Before	the	end	of	this	chapter,	you’ll	understand	all	the	basics for	working	with	containers	and	how	to	control	basic	process isolation	with	Docker.	Most	examples	in	this	book	use	real software.	Practical	examples	will	help	introduce	Docker features	and	illustrate	how	you	will	use	them	in	daily activities.	Using	off-the-shelf	images	also	reduces	the	learning curve	for	new	users.	If	you	have	software	that	you	want	to containerize	and	you’re	in	a	rush,	then	part	2	will	likely answer	more	of	your	direct	questions.  In	this	chapter,	you’ll	install	a	web	server	called	NGINX.	Web servers	are	programs	that	make	website	files	and	programs accessible	to	web	browsers	over	a	network.	You’re	not	going to	build	a	website,	but	you	are	going	to	install	and	start	a	web server	with	Docker.   2.1.	CONTROLLING	CONTAINERS:	BUILDING	A WEBSITE	MONITOR  Suppose	a	new	client	walks	into	your	office	and	makes	an outrageous	request	for	you	to	build	them	a	new	website:	they want	a	website	that’s	closely	monitored.	This	particular	client wants	to	run	their	own	operations,	so	they’ll	want	the	solution you	provide	to	email	their	team	when	the	server	is	down. They’ve	also	heard	about	this	popular	web	server	software called	NGINX	and	have	specifically	requested	that	you	use	it. Having	read	about	the	merits	of	working	with	Docker,	you’ve decided	to	use	it	for	this	project.	Figure	2.1	shows	your planned	architecture	for	the	project.  Figure	2.1.	The	three	containers	that	you’ll	build	in	this	example  This	example	uses	three	containers.	The	first	will	run	NGINX; the	second	will	run	a	program	called	a	mailer.	Both	of	these   will	run	as	detached	containers.	Detached	means	that	the container	will	run	in	the	background,	without	being	attached	to any	input	or	output	stream.	A	third	program	named	watcher will	run	as	a	monitoring	agent	in	an	interactive	container.	Both the	mailer	and	watcher	agent	are	small	scripts	created	for	this example.	In	this	section,	you’ll	learn	how	to	do	the	following:  Create	detached	and	interactive	containers  List	containers	on	your	system  View	container	logs  Stop	and	restart	containers  Reattach	a	terminal	to	a	container  Detach	from	an	attached	container  Without	further	delay,	let’s	get	started	filling	your	client’s order.  2.1.1.	Creating	and	starting	a	new	container  Docker	calls	the	collection	of	files	and	instructions	needed	to run	a	software	program	an	image.	When	we	install	software with	Docker,	we	are	really	using	Docker	to	download	or	create an	image.	There	are	different	ways	to	install	an	image	and several	sources	for	images.	Images	are	covered	in	more	detail in	chapter	3,	but	for	now	you	can	think	of	them	as	the	shipping containers	used	to	transport	physical	goods	around	the	world. Docker	images	hold	everything	a	computer	needs	in	order	to run	software.  In	this	example,	we’re	going	to	download	and	install	an	image for	NGINX	from	Docker	Hub.	Remember,	Docker	Hub	is	the   public	registry	provided	by	Docker	Inc.	The	NGINX	image	is what	Docker	Inc.	calls	a	trusted	repository.	Generally,	the person	or	foundation	that	publishes	the	software	controls	the trusted	repositories	for	that	software.	Running	the	following command	will	download,	install,	and	start	a	container	running NGINX:  docker	run	--detach	\										1 				--name	web	nginx:latest  1	Note	the	detach	flag.  When	you	run	this	command,	Docker	will	install nginx:latest	from	the	NGINX	repository	hosted	on Docker	Hub	 covered	in	chapter	3 	and	run	the	software.	After Docker	has	installed	and	started	running	NGINX,	one	line	of seemingly	random	characters	will	be	written	to	the	terminal.	It will	look	something	like	this:  7cb5d2b9a7eab87f07182b5bf58936c9947890995b1b94f412912fa822a9ecb5  That	blob	of	characters	is	the	unique	identifier	of	the	container that	was	just	created	to	run	NGINX.	Every	time	you	run docker	run	and	create	a	new	container,	that	new	container will	get	a	unique	identifier.	It’s	common	for	users	to	capture this	output	with	a	variable	for	use	with	other	commands.	You don’t	need	to	do	so	for	the	purposes	of	this	example.  After	the	identifier	is	displayed,	it	might	not	seem	like anything	has	happened.	That’s	because	you	used	the	-- detach	option	and	started	the	program	in	the	background.   This	means	that	the	program	started	but	isn’t	attached	to	your terminal.	It	makes	sense	to	start	NGINX	this	way	because we’re	going	to	run	a	few	programs.	Server	software	is generally	run	in	detached	containers	because	it	is	rare	that	the software	depends	on	an	attached	terminal.  Running	detached	containers	is	a	perfect	fit	for	programs	that sit	quietly	in	the	background.	That	type	of	program	is	called	a daemon,	or	a	service.	A	daemon	generally	interacts	with	other programs	or	humans	over	a	network	or	some	other communication	channel.	When	you	launch	a	daemon	or	other program	in	a	container	that	you	want	to	run	in	the	background, remember	to	use	either	the	--detach	flag	or	its	short	form, -d.  Another	daemon	that	your	client	needs	in	this	example	is	a mailer.	A	mailer	waits	for	connections	from	a	caller	and	then sends	an	email.	The	following	command	installs	and	run	a mailer	that	will	work	for	this	example:  docker	run	-d	\												1 				--name	mailer	\ 				dockerinaction ch2_mailer  1	Starts	detached  This	command	uses	the	short	form	of	the	--detach	flag	to start	a	new	container	named	mailer	in	the	background.	At this	point,	you’ve	run	two	commands	and	delivered	two-thirds of	the	system	that	your	client	wants.	The	last	component, called	the	agent,	is	a	good	fit	for	an	interactive	container.   2.1.2.	Running	interactive	containers  A	terminal-based	text	editor	is	a	great	example	of	a	program that	requires	an	attached	terminal.	It	takes	input	from	the	user via	a	keyboard	 and	maybe	mouse 	and	displays	output	on	the terminal.	It	is	interactive	over	its	input	and	output	streams. Running	interactive	programs	in	Docker	requires	that	you	bind parts	of	your	terminal	to	the	input	or	output	of	a	running container.  To	get	started	working	with	interactive	containers,	run	the following	command:  docker	run	--interactive	--tty	\						1 				--link	web:web	\ 				--name	web_test	\ 				busybox:1.29	 bin sh  1	Creates	a	virtual	terminal	and	binds	stdin  The	command	uses	two	flags	on	the	run	command:	-- interactive	 or	-i 	and	--tty	 or	-t .	First,	the	-- interactive	option	tells	Docker	to	keep	the	standard	input stream	 stdin 	open	for	the	container	even	if	no	terminal	is attached.	Second,	the	--tty	option	tells	Docker	to	allocate	a virtual	terminal	for	the	container,	which	will	allow	you	to	pass signals	to	the	container.	This	is	usually	what	you	want	from	an interactive	command-line	program.	You’ll	usually	use	both	of these	when	you’re	running	an	interactive	program	such	as	a shell	in	an	interactive	container.  Just	as	important	as	the	interactive	flags,	when	you	started	this container,	you	specified	the	program	to	run	inside	the   container.	In	this	case,	you	ran	a	shell	program	called	sh.	You can	run	any	program	that’s	available	inside	the	container.  The	command	in	the	interactive	container	example	creates	a container,	starts	a	UNIX	shell,	and	is	linked	to	the	container that’s	running	NGINX.	From	this	shell,	you	can	run	a command	to	verify	that	your	web	server	is	running	correctly:  wget	-O	-	http:  web:80   This	uses	a	program	called	wget	to	make	an	HTTP	request	to the	web	server	 the	NGINX	server	you	started	earlier	in	a container 	and	then	display	the	contents	of	the	web	page	on your	terminal.	Among	the	other	lines,	there	should	be	a message	like	Welcome	to	NGINX!	If	you	see	that message,	then	everything	is	working	correctly,	and	you	can	go ahead	and	shut	down	this	interactive	container	by	typing exit.	This	will	terminate	the	shell	program	and	stop	the container.  It’s	possible	to	create	an	interactive	container,	manually	start	a process	inside	that	container,	and	then	detach	your	terminal. You	can	do	so	by	holding	down	the	Ctrl	 or	Control 	key	and pressing	P	and	then	Q.	This	will	work	only	when	you’ve	used the	--tty	option.  To	finish	the	work	for	your	client,	you	need	to	start	an	agent. This	is	a	monitoring	agent	that	will	test	the	web	server	as	you did	in	the	preceding	example	and	send	a	message	with	the mailer	if	the	web	server	stops.	This	command	will	start	the agent	in	an	interactive	container	by	using	the	short-form	flags:   docker	run	-it	\												1 				--name	agent	\ 				--link	web:insideweb	\ 				--link	mailer:insidemailer	\ 				dockerinaction ch2_agent  1	Creates	a	virtual	terminal	and	binds	stdin  When	running,	the	container	will	test	the	web	container	every second	and	print	a	message	like	the	following:  System	up.  Now	that	you’ve	seen	what	it	does,	detach	your	terminal	from the	container.	Specifically,	when	you	start	the	container	and	it begins	writing	System	up,	hold	the	Ctrl	 or	Control 	key and	then	press	P	and	then	Q.	After	doing	so,	you’ll	be	returned to	the	shell	for	your	host	computer.	Do	not	stop	the	program; otherwise,	the	monitor	will	stop	checking	the	web	server.  Although	you’ll	usually	use	detached	or	daemon	containers	for software	that	you	deploy	to	servers	on	your	network, interactive	containers	are	useful	for	running	software	on	your desktop	or	for	manual	work	on	a	server.	At	this	point,	you’ve started	all	three	applications	in	containers	that	your	client needs.	Before	you	can	confidently	claim	completion,	you should	test	the	system.  2.1.3.	Listing,	stopping,	restarting,	and	viewing	output	of containers  The	first	thing	you	should	do	to	test	your	current	setup	is check	which	containers	are	currently	running	by	using	the   docker	ps	command:  docker	ps  Running	the	command	will	display	the	following	information about	each	running	container:  The	container	ID  The	image	used  The	command	executed	in	the	container  The	time	since	the	container	was	created  The	duration	that	the	container	has	been	running  The	network	ports	exposed	by	the	container  The	name	of	the	container  At	this	point,	you	should	have	three	running	containers	with names:	web,	mailer,	and	agent.	If	any	is	missing	but you’ve	followed	the	example	thus	far,	it	may	have	been mistakenly	stopped.	This	isn’t	a	problem	because	Docker	has	a command	to	restart	a	container.	The	next	three	commands	will restart	each	container	by	using	the	container	name.	Choose	the appropriate	ones	to	restart	the	containers	that	were	missing from	the	list	of	running	containers:  docker	restart	web docker	restart	mailer docker	restart	agent  Now	that	all	three	containers	are	running,	you	need	to	test	that the	system	is	operating	correctly.	The	best	way	to	do	that	is	to examine	the	logs	for	each	container.	Start	with	the	web   container:  docker	logs	web  That	should	display	a	long	log	with	several	lines	that	contain this	substring:  "GET	 	HTTP 1.0"	200  This	means	that	the	web	server	is	running	and	that	the	agent	is testing	the	site.	Each	time	the	agent	tests	the	site,	one	of	these lines	will	be	written	to	the	log.	The	docker	logs	command can	be	helpful	for	these	cases	but	is	dangerous	to	rely	on. Anything	that	the	program	writes	to	the	stdout	or	stderr	output streams	will	be	recorded	in	this	log.	The	problem	with	this pattern	is	that	the	log	is	never	rotated	or	truncated	by	default, so	the	data	written	to	the	log	for	a	container	will	remain	and grow	as	long	as	the	container	exists.	That	long-term persistence	can	be	a	problem	for	long-lived	processes.	A	better way	to	work	with	log	data	uses	volumes	and	is	discussed	in chapter	4.  You	can	tell	that	the	agent	is	monitoring	the	web	server	by examining	the	logs	for	web	alone.	For	completeness,	you should	examine	the	log	output	for	mailer	and	agent	as well:  docker	logs	mailer docker	logs	agent  The	logs	for	mailer	should	look	something	like	this:   CH2	Example	Mailer	has	started.  The	logs	for	agent	should	contain	several	lines	like	the	one you	watched	it	write	when	you	started	the	container:  System	up.  Tip  The	docker	logs	command	has	a	flag,	--follow	or	-f, that	will	display	the	logs	and	then	continue	watching	and updating	the	display	with	changes	to	the	log	as	they	occur. When	you’ve	finished,	press	Ctrl-C	 or	Command-C 	to interrupt	the	logs	command.  Now	that	you’ve	validated	that	the	containers	are	running	and that	the	agent	can	reach	the	web	server,	you	should	test	that the	agent	will	notice	when	the	web	container	stops.	When	that happens,	the	agent	should	trigger	a	call	to	the	mailer,	and	the event	should	be	recorded	in	the	logs	for	both	agent	and mailer.	The	docker	stop	command	tells	the	program with	PID	1	in	the	container	to	halt.	Use	it	in	the	following commands	to	test	the	system:  docker	stop	web							1 docker	logs	mailer				2  1	Stops	the	web	server	by	stopping	the	container  2	Waits	a	couple	of	seconds	and	checks	the	mailer	logs   Look	for	a	line	at	the	end	of	the	mailer	logs	that	reads	like	this:  Sending	email:	To:	admin@work		Message:	The	service	is	down!  That	line	means	the	agent	successfully	detected	that	the NGINX	server	in	the	container	named	web	had	stopped. Congratulations!	Your	client	will	be	happy,	and	you’ve	built your	first	real	system	with	containers	and	Docker.  Learning	the	basic	Docker	features	is	one	thing,	but understanding	why	they’re	useful	and	how	to	use	them	to customize	isolation	is	another	task	entirely.   2.2.	SOLVED	PROBLEMS	AND	THE	PID	NAMESPACE  Every	running	program—or	process—on	a	Linux	machine	has a	unique	number	called	a	process	identifier	 PID .	A	PID namespace	is	a	set	of	unique	numbers	that	identify	processes. Linux	provides	tools	to	create	multiple	PID	namespaces.	Each namespace	has	a	complete	set	of	possible	PIDs.	This	means that	each	PID	namespace	will	contain	its	own	PID	1,	2,	3,	and so	on.  Most	programs	will	not	need	access	to	other	running	processes or	be	able	to	list	the	other	running	processes	on	the	system. And	so	Docker	creates	a	new	PID	namespace	for	each container	by	default.	A	container’s	PID	namespace	isolates processes	in	that	container	from	processes	in	other	containers.  From	the	perspective	of	a	process	in	one	container	with	its own	namespace,	PID	1	might	refer	to	an	init	system	process such	as	runit	or	supervisord.	In	a	different	container, PID	1	might	refer	to	a	command	shell	such	as	bash.	Run	the following	to	see	it	in	action:  docker	run	-d	--name	namespaceA	\ 				busybox:1.29	 bin sh	-c	"sleep	30000" docker	run	-d	--name	namespaceB	\ 				busybox:1.29	 bin sh	-c	"nc	-l	0.0.0.0	-p	80"  docker	exec	namespaceA	ps						1 docker	exec	namespaceB	ps						2  Command	1	should	generate	a	process	list	similar	to	the   following:  PID			USER					TIME		COMMAND 		1			root					0:00		sleep	30000 		8			root					0:00		ps  Command	2	should	generate	a	slightly	different	process	list:  PID			USER					TIME		COMMAND 		1			root					0:00		nc	-l	0.0.0.0	-p	80 		9			root					0:00		ps  In	this	example,	you	use	the	docker	exec	command	to	run additional	processes	in	a	running	container.	In	this	case,	the command	you	use	is	called	ps,	which	shows	all	the	running processes	and	their	PID.	From	the	output,	you	can	clearly	see that	each	container	has	a	process	with	PID	1.  Without	a	PID	namespace,	the	processes	running	inside	a container	would	share	the	same	ID	space	as	those	in	other containers	or	on	the	host.	A	process	in	a	container	would	be able	to	determine	what	other	processes	were	running	on	the host	machine.	Worse,	processes	in	one	container	might	be	able to	control	processes	in	other	containers.	A	process	that	cannot reference	any	processes	outside	its	namespace	is	limited	in	its ability	to	perform	targeted	attacks.  Like	most	Docker	isolation	features,	you	can	optionally	create containers	without	their	own	PID	namespace.	This	is	critical	if you	are	using	a	program	to	perform	a	system	administration task	that	requires	process	enumeration	from	within	a	container. You	can	try	this	yourself	by	setting	the	--pid	flag	on   docker	create	or	docker	run	and	setting	the	value	to host.	Try	it	yourself	with	a	container	running	BusyBox Linux	and	the	ps	Linux	command:  docker	run	--pid	host	busybox:1.29	ps					1  1	Should	list	all	processes	running	on	the	computer  Because	containers	all	have	their	own	PID	namespace,	they both	cannot	gain	meaningful	insight	from	examining	it,	and can	take	more	static	dependencies	on	it.	Suppose	a	container runs	two	processes:	a	server	and	a	local	process	monitor.	That monitor	could	take	a	hard	dependency	on	the	server’s	expected PID	and	use	that	to	monitor	and	control	the	server.	This	is	an example	of	environment	independence.  Consider	the	previous	web-monitoring	example.	Suppose	you were	not	using	Docker	and	were	just	running	NGINX	directly on	your	computer.	Now	suppose	you	forgot	that	you	had already	started	NGINX	for	another	project.	When	you	start NGINX	again,	the	second	process	won’t	be	able	to	access	the resources	it	needs	because	the	first	process	already	has	them. This	is	a	basic	software	conflict	example.	You	can	see	it	in action	by	trying	to	run	two	copies	of	NGINX	in	the	same container:  docker	run	-d	--name	webConflict	nginx:latest docker	logs	webConflict																												1 docker	exec	webConflict	nginx	-g	'daemon	off;'					2  1	Output	should	be	empty.  2	Starts	a	second	NGINX	process	in	the	same	container   The	last	command	should	display	output	like	this:  2015 03 29	22:04:35	[emerg]	100:	bind  	to	0.0.0.0:80	failed  98: Address	already	in	use  nginx:	[emerg]	bind  	to	0.0.0.0:80	failed	 98:	Address	already in	use  ...  The	second	process	fails	to	start	properly	and	reports	that	the address	it	needs	is	already	in	use.	Called	a	port	conflict,	this	is a	common	issue	in	real-world	systems	in	which	several processes	are	running	on	the	same	computer	or	multiple people	contribute	to	the	same	environment.	It’s	a	great example	of	a	conflict	problem	that	Docker	simplifies	and solves.	Run	each	in	a	different	container,	like	this:  docker	run	-d	--name	webA	nginx:latest				1  docker	logs	webA																										2  docker	run	-d	--name	webB	nginx:latest				3  docker	logs	webB																										4  1	Starts	the	first	NGINX	instance  2	Verifies	that	it	is	working;	should	be	empty.  3	Starts	the	second	instance  4	Verifies	that	it	is	working;	should	be	empty  Environment	independence	provides	the	freedom	to	configure software	taking	dependencies	on	scarce	system	resources without	regard	for	other	co-located	software	with	conflicting requirements.	Here	are	some	common	conflict	problems:  Two	programs	want	to	bind	to	the	same	network	port.   Two	programs	use	the	same	temporary	filename,	and	file	locks	are preventing	that.  Two	programs	want	to	use	different	versions	of	a	globally	installed library.  Two	processes	want	to	use	the	same	PID	file.  A	second	program	you	installed	modified	an	environment	variable	that another	program	uses.	Now	the	first	program	breaks.  Multiple	processes	are	competing	for	memory	or	CPU	time.  All	these	conflicts	arise	when	one	or	more	programs	have	a common	dependency	but	can’t	agree	to	share	or	have	different needs.	As	in	the	earlier	port	conflict	example,	Docker	solves software	conflicts	with	such	tools	as	Linux	namespaces, resource	limits,	filesystem	roots,	and	virtualized	network components.	All	these	tools	are	used	to	isolate	software	inside a	Docker	container.   2.3.	ELIMINATING	METACONFLICTS:	BUILDING	A WEBSITE	FARM  In	the	preceding	section,	you	saw	how	Docker	helps	you	avoid software	conflicts	with	process	isolation.	But	if	you’re	not careful,	you	can	end	up	building	systems	that	create metaconflicts,	or	conflicts	between	containers	in	the	Docker layer.  Consider	another	example:	a	client	has	asked	you	to	build	a system	on	which	you	can	host	a	variable	number	of	websites for	their	customers.	They’d	also	like	to	employ	the	same monitoring	technology	that	you	built	earlier	in	this	chapter. Expanding	the	system	you	built	earlier	would	be	the	simplest way	to	get	this	job	done	without	customizing	the	configuration for	NGINX.	In	this	example,	you’ll	build	a	system	with several	containers	running	web	servers	and	a	monitoring watcher	for	each	web	server.	The	system	will	look	like	the architecture	described	in	figure	2.2.  Figure	2.2.	A	fleet	of	web	server	containers	and	related	monitoring	agents   Your	first	instinct	might	be	to	simply	start	more	web containers.	But	that’s	not	as	simple	as	it	looks.	Identifying containers	gets	complicated	as	the	number	of	containers increases.  2.3.1.	Flexible	container	identification  The	best	way	to	find	out	why	simply	creating	more	copies	of the	NGINX	container	you	used	in	the	previous	example	is	a bad	idea	is	to	try	it	for	yourself:  docker	run	-d	--name	webid	nginx						1  docker	run	-d	--name	webid	nginx						2  1	Creates	a	container	named	"webid"  2	Creates	another	container	named	"webid"   The	second	command	here	will	fail	with	a	conflict	error:  FATA[0000]	Error	response	from	daemon:	Conflict.	The	name "webid"	is already	in	use	by	container	2b5958ba6a00.	You	have	to	delete  or	rename  that	container	to	be	able	to	reuse	that	name.  Using	fixed	container	names	such	as	web	is	useful	for experimentation	and	documentation,	but	in	a	system	with multiple	containers,	using	fixed	names	like	that	can	create conflicts.	By	default,	Docker	assigns	a	unique	 human- friendly 	name	to	each	container	it	creates.	The	--name	flag overrides	that	process	with	a	known	value.	If	a	situation	arises in	which	the	name	of	a	container	needs	to	change,	you	can always	rename	the	container	with	the	docker	rename command:  docker	rename	webid	webid-old								1 docker	run	-d	--name	webid	nginx					2  1	Renames	the	current	web	container	to	"webid-old"  2	Creates	another	container	named	"webid"  Renaming	containers	can	help	alleviate	one-off	naming conflicts	but	does	little	to	help	avoid	the	problem	in	the	first place.	In	addition	to	the	name,	Docker	assigns	a	unique identifier	that	was	mentioned	in	the	first	example.	These	are hex-encoded	1024-bit	numbers	and	look	something	like	this:  7cb5d2b9a7eab87f07182b5bf58936c9947890995b1b94f412912fa822a9ecb5  When	containers	are	started	in	detached	mode,	their	identifier   will	be	printed	to	the	terminal.	You	can	use	these	identifiers	in place	of	the	container	name	with	any	command	that	needs	to identify	a	specific	container.	For	example,	you	could	use	the previous	ID	with	a	stop	or	exec	command:  docker	exec	\ 				 7cb5d2b9a7eab87f07182b5bf58936c9947890995b1b94f412912fa822a9ecb5 	\ echo	hello 	 docker	stop	\ 				 7cb5d2b9a7eab87f07182b5bf58936c9947890995b1b94f412912fa822a9ecb5  The	high	probability	of	uniqueness	of	the	IDs	that	are generated	means	that	it	is	unlikely	that	there	will	ever	be	a collision	with	this	ID.	To	a	lesser	degree,	it	is	also	unlikely that	there	would	even	be	a	collision	of	the	first	12	characters of	this	ID	on	the	same	computer.	So	in	most	Docker	interfaces, you’ll	see	container	IDs	truncated	to	their	first	12	characters. This	makes	generated	IDs	a	bit	more	user-friendly.	You	can use	them	wherever	a	container	identifier	is	required.	The previous	two	commands	could	be	written	like	this:  docker	exec	7cb5d2b9a7ea	ps docker	stop	7cb5d2b9a7ea  Neither	of	these	IDs	is	particularly	well	suited	for	human	use. But	they	work	well	with	scripts	and	automation	techniques. Docker	has	several	means	of	acquiring	the	ID	of	a	container	to make	automation	possible.	In	these	cases,	the	full	or	truncated numeric	ID	will	be	used.   The	first	way	to	get	the	numeric	ID	of	a	container	is	to	simply start	or	create	a	new	one	and	assign	the	result	of	the	command to	a	shell	variable.	As	you	saw	earlier,	when	a	new	container	is started	in	detached	mode,	the	container	ID	will	be	written	to the	terminal	 stdout .	You’d	be	unable	to	use	this	with interactive	containers	if	this	were	the	only	way	to	get	the container	ID	at	creation	time.	Luckily,	you	can	use	another command	to	create	a	container	without	starting	it.	The docker	create	command	is	similar	to	docker	run,	the primary	difference	being	that	the	container	is	created	in	a stopped	state:  docker	create	nginx  The	result	should	be	a	line	like	this:  b26a631e536d3caae348e9fd36e7661254a11511eb2274fb55f9f7c788721b0d  If	you’re	using	a	Linux	command	shell	such	as	sh	or	bash,	you can	assign	that	result	to	a	shell	variable	and	use	it	again	later:  CID=$ docker	create	nginx:latest 					1 echo	$CID  1	This	will	work	on	POSIX-compliant	shells.  Shell	variables	create	a	new	opportunity	for	conflict,	but	the scope	of	that	conflict	is	limited	to	the	terminal	session	or current	processing	environment	in	which	the	script	was launched.	Those	conflicts	should	be	easily	avoidable	because one	use	or	program	is	managing	that	environment.	The   problem	with	this	approach	is	that	it	won’t	help	if	multiple users	or	automated	processes	need	to	share	that	information.	In those	cases,	you	can	use	a	container	ID	 CID 	file.  Both	the	docker	run	and	docker	create	commands provide	another	flag	to	write	the	ID	of	a	new	container	to	a known	file:  docker	create	--cidfile	 tmp web.cid	nginx					1  cat	 tmp web.cid																															2  1	Creates	a	new	stopped	container  2	Inspects	the	file  Like	the	use	of	shell	variables,	this	feature	increases	the opportunity	for	conflict.	The	name	of	the	CID	file	 provided after	--cidfile 	must	be	known	or	have	some	known structure.	Just	like	manual	container	naming,	this	approach uses	known	names	in	a	global	 Docker-wide 	namespace.	The good	news	is	that	Docker	won’t	create	a	new	container	by using	the	provided	CID	file	if	that	file	already	exists.	The command	will	fail	just	as	it	does	when	you	create	two containers	with	the	same	name.  One	reason	to	use	CID	files	instead	of	names	is	that	CID	files can	be	shared	with	containers	easily	and	renamed	for	that container.	This	uses	a	Docker	feature	called	volumes,	which	is covered	in	chapter	4.  Tip   One	strategy	for	dealing	with	CID	file-naming	collisions	is	to partition	the	namespace	by	using	known	or	predictable	path conventions.	For	example,	in	this	scenario,	you	might	use	a path	that	contains	all	web	containers	under	a	known	directory and	further	partition	that	directory	by	the	customer	ID.	This would	result	in	a	path	such	as  containers web customer1 web.cid	or  containers web customer8 web.cid.  In	other	cases,	you	can	use	other	commands	such	as	docker ps	to	get	the	ID	of	a	container.	For	example,	if	you	want	to get	the	truncated	ID	of	the	last	created	container,	you	can	use this:  CID=$ docker	ps	--latest	--quiet 					1 echo	$CID  CID=$ docker	ps	-l	-q 																2 echo	$CID  1	This	will	work	on	POSIX-compliant	shells.  2	Run	again	with	the	short-form	flags.  Tip  If	you	want	to	get	the	full	container	ID,	you	can	use	the	-- no-trunc	option	on	the	docker	ps	command.  Automation	cases	are	covered	by	the	features	you’ve	seen	so   far.	But	even	though	truncation	helps,	these	container	IDs	are rarely	easy	to	read	or	remember.	For	this	reason,	Docker	also generates	human-readable	names	for	each	container.  The	naming	convention	uses	a	personal	adjective;	an underscore;	and	the	last	name	of	an	influential	scientist, engineer,	inventor,	or	other	such	thought	leader.	Examples	of generated	names	are	compassionate_swartz, hungry_goodall,	and	distracted_turing.	These seem	to	hit	a	sweet	spot	for	readability	and	memory.	When you’re	working	with	the	docker	tool	directly,	you	can always	use	docker	ps	to	look	up	the	human-friendly names.  Container	identification	can	be	tricky,	but	you	can	manage	the issue	by	using	the	ID	and	name-generation	features	of	Docker.  2.3.2.	Container	state	and	dependencies  With	this	new	knowledge,	the	new	system	might	look something	like	this:  MAILER_CID=$ docker	run	-d	dockerinaction ch2_mailer 					1 WEB_CID=$ docker	create	nginx   AGENT_CID=$ docker	create	--link	$WEB_CID:insideweb	\ 				--link	$MAILER_CID:insidemailer	\ 				dockerinaction ch2_agent   1	Make	sure	mailer	from	first	example	is	running.  This	snippet	could	be	used	to	seed	a	new	script	that	launches	a new	NGINX	and	agent	instance	for	each	of	your	client’s customers.	You	can	use	docker	ps	to	see	that	they’ve	been   created:  docker	ps  The	reason	neither	the	NGINX	nor	the	agent	was	included with	the	output	has	to	do	with	container	state.	Docker containers	will	be	in	one	of	the	states	shown	in	figure	2.3.	The Docker	container	management	commands	to	move	between states	annotate	each	transition.  Figure	2.3.	The	state	transition	diagram	for	Docker	containers  Neither	of	the	new	containers	you	started	appears	in	the	list	of containers	because	docker	ps	shows	only	running containers	by	default.	Those	containers	were	specifically created	with	docker	create	and	never	started	 the	created state .	To	see	all	the	containers	 including	those	in	the	created state ,	use	the	-a	option:  docker	ps	-a   The	status	of	the	new	containers	should	be	"Created".	The docker	ps	command	displays	the	container	state	using	the “friendly”	names	shown	in	gray	in	figure	2.3.	The	docker inspect	command	uses	the	names	shown	in	the	bottom	half of	each	state	 for	example,	created .	The	restarting, removing,	and	dead	 not	illustrated 	states	are	internal	to Docker	and	are	used	to	track	transitions	between	the	states visible	in	docker	ps.  Now	that	you’ve	verified	that	both	of	the	containers	were created,	you	need	to	start	them.	For	that,	you	can	use	the docker	start	command:  docker	start	$AGENT_CID docker	start	$WEB_CID  Running	those	commands	will	result	in	an	error.	The containers	need	to	be	started	in	reverse	order	of	their dependency	chain.	Because	you	tried	to	start	the	agent container	before	the	web	container,	Docker	reported	a	message like	this	one:  Error	response	from	daemon:	Cannot	start	container 03e65e3c6ee34e714665a8dc4e33fb19257d11402b151380ed4c0a5e38779d0a: 	Cannot link	to	a	non	running	container:	 clever_wright	AS  modest_hopper insideweb FATA[0000]	Error:	failed	to	start	one	or	more	containers  In	this	example,	the	agent	container	has	a	dependency	on	the web	container.	You	need	to	start	the	web	container	first:  docker	start	$WEB_CID docker	start	$AGENT_CID   This	makes	sense	when	you	consider	the	mechanics	at	work. The	link	mechanism	injects	IP	addresses	into	dependent containers,	and	containers	that	aren’t	running	don’t	have	IP addresses.	If	you	tried	to	start	a	container	that	has	a dependency	on	a	container	that	isn’t	running,	Docker	wouldn’t have	an	IP	address	to	inject.	In	chapter	5,	you’ll	learn	to connect	containers	with	user-defined	bridge	networks	to	avoid this	particular	dependency	problem.	The	key	point	here	is	that Docker	will	try	to	resolve	a	container’s	dependencies	before creating	or	starting	a	container	to	avoid	application	runtime failures.  The	legacy	of	container	network	linking  You	may	notice	that	the	Docker	documentation	describes network	links	as	a	legacy	feature.	Network	links	were	an	early and	popular	way	to	connect	containers.	Links	create	a unidirectional	network	connection	from	one	container	to	other containers	on	the	same	host.	Significant	portions	of	the container	ecosystem	asked	for	fully	peered,	bidirectional connections	between	containers.	Docker	provides	this	with	the user-defined	networks	described	in	chapter	5.	These	networks can	also	extend	across	a	cluster	of	hosts	as	described	in chapter	13.	Network	links	and	user-defined	networks	are	not equivalent,	but	Docker	recommends	migrating	to	user-defined networks.  It	is	uncertain	whether	the	container	network	linking	feature will	ever	be	removed.	Numerous	useful	tools	and   unidirectional	communication	patterns	depend	on	linking,	as illustrated	by	the	containers	used	to	inspect	and	watch	the	web and	mailer	components	in	this	section.  Whether	you’re	using	docker	run	or	docker	create, the	resulting	containers	need	to	be	started	in	the	reverse	order of	their	dependency	chain.	This	means	that	circular dependencies	are	impossible	to	build	using	Docker	container relationships.  At	this	point,	you	can	put	everything	together	into	one	concise script	that	looks	like	this:  MAILER_CID=$ docker	run	-d	dockerinaction ch2_mailer  	 WEB_CID=$ docker	run	-d	nginx  	 AGENT_CID=$ docker	run	-d	\ 				--link	$WEB_CID:insideweb	\ 				--link	$MAILER_CID:insidemailer	\ 				dockerinaction ch2_agent   Now	you’re	confident	that	this	script	can	be	run	without exception	each	time	your	client	needs	to	provision	a	new	site. Your	client	has	returned	and	thanked	you	for	the	web	and monitoring	work	you’ve	completed	so	far,	but	things	have changed.  They’ve	decided	to	focus	on	building	their	websites	with WordPress	 a	popular	open	source	content-management	and blogging	program .	Luckily,	WordPress	is	published	through Docker	Hub	in	a	repository	named	wordpress.	All	you’ll   need	to	deliver	is	a	set	of	commands	to	provision	a	new WordPress	website	that	has	the	same	monitoring	and	alerting features	that	you’ve	already	delivered.  An	interesting	thing	about	content-management	systems	and other	stateful	systems	is	that	the	data	they	work	with	makes each	running	program	specialized.	Adam’s	WordPress	blog	is different	from	Betty’s	WordPress	blog,	even	if	they’re	running the	same	software.	Only	the	content	is	different.	Even	if	the content	is	the	same,	they’re	different	because	they’re	running on	different	sites.  If	you	build	systems	or	software	that	know	too	much	about their	environment—for	example,	addresses	or	fixed	locations of	dependency	services—it’s	difficult	to	change	that environment	or	reuse	the	software.	You	need	to	deliver	a system	that	minimizes	environment	dependence	before	the contract	is	complete.   2.4.	BUILDING	ENVIRONMENT-AGNOSTIC	SYSTEMS  Much	of	the	work	associated	with	installing	software	or maintaining	a	fleet	of	computers	lies	in	dealing	with specializations	of	the	computing	environment.	These specializations	come	as	global-scoped	dependencies	 for example,	known	host	filesystem	locations ,	hardcoded deployment	architectures	 environment	checks	in	code	or configuration ,	or	data	locality	 data	stored	on	a	particular computer	outside	the	deployment	architecture .	Knowing	this, if	your	goal	is	to	build	low-maintenance	systems,	you	should strive	to	minimize	these	things.  Docker	has	three	specific	features	to	help	build	environment- agnostic	systems:  Read-only	filesystems  Environment	variable	injection  Volumes  Working	with	volumes	is	a	big	subject	and	the	topic	of	chapter 4.	To	learn	the	first	two	features,	consider	a	requirement change	for	the	example	situation	used	in	the	rest	of	this chapter:	WordPress	uses	a	database	program	called	MySQL	to store	most	of	its	data,	so	it’s	a	good	idea	to	provide	the container	running	WordPress	with	a	read-only	filesystem	to ensure	data	is	written	only	to	the	database.  2.4.1.	Read-only	filesystems   Using	read-only	filesystems	accomplishes	two	positive	things. First,	you	can	have	confidence	that	the	container	won’t	be specialized	from	changes	to	the	files	it	contains.	Second,	you have	increased	confidence	that	an	attacker	can’t	compromise files	in	the	container.  To	get	started	working	on	your	client’s	system,	create	and	start a	container	from	the	WordPress	image	by	using	the	--read- only	flag:  docker	run	-d	--name	wp	--read-only	\ 				wordpress:5.0.0-php7.2-apache  When	this	is	finished,	check	that	the	container	is	running.	You can	do	so	using	any	of	the	methods	introduced	previously,	or you	can	inspect	the	container	metadata	directly.	The	following command	will	print	true	if	the	container	named	wp	is running,	and	false	otherwise:  docker	inspect	--format	"{{.State.Running}}"	wp  The	docker	inspect	command	will	display	all	the metadata	 a	JSON	document 	that	Docker	maintains	for	a container.	The	format	option	transforms	that	metadata,	and	in this	case,	it	filters	everything	except	for	the	field	indicating	the running	state	of	the	container.	This	command	should	simply output	false.  In	this	case,	the	container	isn’t	running.	To	determine	why, examine	the	logs	for	the	container:  docker	logs	wp   docker	logs	wp  That	command	should	output	something	like	this:  WordPress	not	found	in	 var www html	-	copying	now... Complete!	WordPress	has	been	successfully	copied	to	  var www html ...	skip	output	... Wed	Dec	12	15:17:36	2018	 1 :	Fatal	Error	Unable	to	create	lock	 file:	 Bad	file	descriptor	 9   When	running	WordPress	with	a	read-only	filesystem,	the Apache	web	server	process	reports	that	it	is	unable	to	create	a lock	file.	Unfortunately,	it	does	not	report	the	location	of	the files	it	is	trying	to	create.	If	we	have	the	locations,	we	can create	exceptions	for	them.	Let’s	run	a	WordPress	container with	a	writable	filesystem	so	that	Apache	is	free	to	write where	it	wants:  docker	run	-d	--name	wp_writable	wordpress:5.0.0-php7.2-apache  Now	let’s	check	where	Apache	changed	the	container’s filesystem	with	the	docker	diff	command:  docker	container	diff	wp_writable C	 run C	 run apache2 A	 run apache2 apache2.pid  We	will	explain	the	diff	command	and	how	Docker	knows what	changed	on	the	filesystem	in	more	detail	in	chapter	3. For	now,	it’s	sufficient	to	know	that	the	output	indicates	that Apache	created	the	 run apache2	directory	and	added	the apache2.pid	file	inside	it.   Since	this	is	an	expected	part	of	normal	application	operation, we	will	make	an	exception	to	the	read-only	filesystem.	We will	allow	the	container	to	write	to	 run apache2	by	using	a writable	volume	mounted	from	the	host.	We	will	also	supply	a temporary,	in-memory,	filesystem	to	the	container	at	 tmp since	Apache	requires	a	writable	temporary	directory,	as	well:  docker	run	-d	--name	wp2	\ 		--read-only	\																				1 		-v	 run apache2 	\															2 		--tmpfs	 tmp	\																			3 		wordpress:5.0.0-php7.2-apache  1	Makes	container’s	root	filesystem	read-only  2	Mounts	a	writable	directory	from	the	host  3	Provides	container	an	in-memory	temp	filesystem  That	command	should	log	successful	messages	that	look	like this:  docker	logs	wp2 WordPress	not	found	in	 var www html	-	copying	now...

A database	is	a	program	that	stores	data	in	such	a	way	that	it’s retrievable	and	searchable	later.	The	good	news	is	that	you	can install	MySQL	by	using	Docker,	just	like	WordPress:   docker	run	-d	--name	wpdb	\ 				-e	MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=ch2demo	\ 				mysql:5.7  Once	that	is	started,	create	a	different	WordPress	container that’s	linked	to	this	new	database	container:  docker	run	-d	--name	wp3	\									1 				--link	wpdb:mysql	\												2 				-p	8000:80	\																			3 				--read-only	\ 				-v	 run apache2 	\ 				--tmpfs	 tmp	\ 				wordpress:5.0.0-php7.2-apache  1	Uses	a	unique	name  2	Creates	a	link	to	the	database  3	Directs	traffic	from	host	port	8000	to	container	port	80  Check	one	more	time	that	WordPress	is	running	correctly:  docker	inspect	--format	"{{.State.Running}}"	wp3  The	output	should	now	be	true.

By	using	a	read-only	filesystem	and linking	WordPress	to	another	container	running	a	database, you	can	be	sure	that	the	container	running	the	WordPress image	will	never	change.	This	means	that	if	there	is	ever something	wrong	with	the	computer	running	a	client’s WordPress	blog,	you	should	be	able	to	start	up	another	copy	of that	container	elsewhere	with	no	problems.  But	this	design	has	two	problems.	First,	the	database	is running	in	a	container	on	the	same	computer	as	the	WordPress container.	Second,	WordPress	is	using	several	default	values for	important	settings	such	as	database	name,	administrative user,	administrative	password,	database	salt,	and	so	on.  To	deal	with	this	problem,	you	could	create	several	versions	of the	WordPress	software,	each	with	a	special	configuration	for the	client.	Doing	so	would	turn	your	simple	provisioning	script into	a	monster	that	creates	images	and	writes	files.	A	better way	to	inject	that	configuration	would	be	through	the	use	of environment	variables.   2.4.2.	Environment	variable	injection  Environment	variables	are	key value	pairs	that	are	made available	to	programs	through	their	execution	context.	They	let you	change	a	program’s	configuration	without	modifying	any files	or	changing	the	command	used	to	start	the	program.  Docker	uses	environment	variables	to	communicate information	about	dependent	containers,	the	hostname	of	the container,	and	other	convenient	information	for	programs running	in	containers.	Docker	also	provides	a	mechanism	for	a user	to	inject	environment	variables	into	a	new	container. Programs	that	know	to	expect	important	information	through environment	variables	can	be	configured	at	container-creation time.	Luckily	for	you	and	your	client,	WordPress	is	one	such program.  Before	diving	into	WordPress	specifics,	try	injecting	and viewing	environment	variables	on	your	own.	The	UNIX command	env	displays	all	the	environment	variables	in	the current	execution	context	 your	terminal .	To	see	environment variable	injection	in	action,	use	the	following	command:  docker	run	--env	MY_ENVIRONMENT_VAR="this	is	a	test"	\						1 				busybox:1.29	\ 				env																																																					2  1	Injects	an	environment	variable  2	Executes	the	env	command	inside	the	container  The	--env	flag,	or	-e	for	short,	can	be	used	to	inject	any environment	variable.	If	the	variable	is	already	set	by	the   image	or	Docker,	the	value	will	be	overridden.	This	way, programs	running	inside	containers	can	rely	on	the	variables always	being	set.	WordPress	observes	the	following environment	variables:  WORDPRESS_DB_HOST  WORDPRESS_DB_USER  WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD  WORDPRESS_DB_NAME  WORDPRESS_AUTH_KEY  WORDPRESS_SECURE_AUTH_KEY  WORDPRESS_LOGGED_IN_KEY  WORDPRESS_NONCE_KEY  WORDPRESS_AUTH_SALT  WORDPRESS_SECURE_AUTH_SALT  WORDPRESS_LOGGED_IN_SALT  WORDPRESS_NONCE_SALT  Tip  This	example	neglects	the	KEY	and	SALT	variables,	but	any real	production	system	should	absolutely	set	these	values.  To	get	started,	you	should	address	the	problem	that	the database	is	running	in	a	container	on	the	same	computer	as	the WordPress	container.	Rather	than	using	linking	to	satisfy WordPress’s	database	dependency,	inject	a	value	for	the WORDPRESS_DB_HOST	variable:   docker	create	--env	WORDPRESS_DB_HOST= 	\ 				wordpress:	5.0.0-php7.2-apache  This	example	would	create	 not	start 	a	container	for WordPress	that	will	try	to	connect	to	a	MySQL	database	at whatever	you	specify	at	 . Because	the	remote	database	isn’t	likely	using	any	default username	or	password,	you’ll	have	to	inject	values	for	those settings	as	well.	Suppose	the	database	administrator	is	a	cat lover	and	hates	strong	passwords:  docker	create	\ 				--env	WORDPRESS_DB_HOST= 	\ 				--env	WORDPRESS_DB_USER=site_admin	\ 				--env	WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD=MeowMix42	\ 				wordpress:5.0.0-php7.2-apache  Using	environment	variable	injection	this	way	will	help	you separate	the	physical	ties	between	a	WordPress	container	and	a MySQL	container.	Even	when	you	want	to	host	the	database and	your	customer	WordPress	sites	all	on	the	same	machine, you’ll	still	need	to	fix	the	second	problem	mentioned	earlier. All	the	sites	are	using	the	same	default	database	name,	which means	different	clients	will	be	sharing	a	single	database. You’ll	need	to	use	environment	variable	injection	to	set	the database	name	for	each	independent	site	by	specifying	the WORDPRESS_DB_NAME	variable:  docker	create	--link	wpdb:mysql	\ 				-e	WORDPRESS_DB_NAME=client_a_wp	\					1 				wordpress:5.0.0-php7.2-apache  docker	create	--link	wpdb:mysql	\ 				-e	WORDPRESS_DB_NAME=client_b_wp	\					2 				wordpress:5.0.0-php7.2-apache   1	For	client	A  2	For	client	B  Now	that	you	understand	how	to	inject	configuration	into	the WordPress	application	and	connect	it	to	collaborating processes,	let’s	adapt	the	provisioning	script.	First,	let’s	start database	and	mailer	containers	that	will	be	shared	by	our clients	and	store	the	container	IDs	in	environment	variables:  export	DB_CID=$ docker	run	-d	-e	MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=ch2demo mysql:5.7  export	MAILER_CID=$ docker	run	-d	dockerinaction ch2_mailer   Now	update	the	client	site	provisioning	script	to	read	the database	container	ID,	mailer	container	ID,	and	a	new CLIENT_ID	from	environment	variables:  ! bin sh  if	[	!	-n	"$CLIENT_ID"	];	then									1 				echo	"Client	ID	not	set" 				exit	1 fi  WP_CID=$ docker	create	\ 				--link	$DB_CID:mysql	\													2 				--name	wp_$CLIENT_ID	\ 				-p	80	\ 				--read-only	-v	 run apache2 	--tmpfs	 tmp	\ 				-e	WORDPRESS_DB_NAME=$CLIENT_ID	\ 				--read-only	wordpress:5.0.0-php7.2-apache   docker	start	$WP_CID  AGENT_CID=$ docker	create	\ 								--name	agent_$CLIENT_ID	\ 				--link	$WP_CID:insideweb	\ 				--link	$MAILER_CID:insidemailer	\ 				dockerinaction ch2_agent   docker	start	$AGENT_CID   1	Assumes	$CLIENT_ID	variable	is	set	as	input	to	script  2	Creates	link	using	DB_CID  If	you	save	this	script	to	a	file	named	start-wp-for-client.sh, you	can	provision	WordPress	for	the	dockerinaction client	by	using	a	command	like	this:  CLIENT_ID=dockerinaction	. start-wp-multiple-clients.sh  This	new	script	will	start	an	instance	of	WordPress	and	the monitoring	agent	for	each	customer	and	connect	those containers	to	each	other	as	well	as	a	single	mailer	program	and MySQL	database.	The	WordPress	containers	can	be	destroyed, restarted,	and	upgraded	without	any	worry	about	loss	of	data. Figure	2.4	shows	this	architecture.  Figure	2.4.	Each	WordPress	and	agent	container	uses	the	same	database	and	mailer.   The	client	should	be	pleased	with	what	is	being	delivered.	But one	thing	might	be	bothering	you.	In	earlier	testing,	you	found that	the	monitoring	agent	correctly	notified	the	mailer	when the	site	was	unavailable,	but	restarting	the	site	and	agent required	manual	work.	It	would	be	better	if	the	system	tried	to automatically	recover	when	a	failure	was	detected.	Docker provides	restart	policies	to	help	deal	with	that,	but	you	might want	something	more	robust.   2.5.	BUILDING	DURABLE	CONTAINERS  Software	may	fail	in	rare	conditions	that	are	temporary	in nature.	Although	it’s	important	to	be	made	aware	when	these conditions	arise,	it’s	usually	at	least	as	important	to	restore	the service	as	quickly	as	possible.	The	monitoring	system	that	you built	in	this	chapter	is	a	fine	start	for	keeping	system	owners aware	of	problems	with	a	system,	but	it	does	nothing	to	help restore	service.  When	all	the	processes	in	a	container	have	exited,	that container	will	enter	the	exited	state.	Remember,	a	Docker container	can	be	in	one	of	six	states:  Created  Running  Restarting  Paused  Removing  Exited	 also	used	if	the	container	has	never	been	started   A	basic	strategy	for	recovering	from	temporary	failures	is automatically	restarting	a	process	when	it	exits	or	fails. Docker	provides	a	few	options	for	monitoring	and	restarting containers.  2.5.1.	Automatically	restarting	containers  Docker	provides	this	functionality	with	a	restart	policy.	Using   the	--restart	flag	at	container-creation	time,	you	can	tell Docker	to	do	any	of	the	following:  Never	restart	 default   Attempt	to	restart	when	a	failure	is	detected  Attempt	for	some	predetermined	time	to	restart	when	a	failure	is	detected  Always	restart	the	container	regardless	of	the	condition  Docker	doesn’t	always	attempt	to	immediately	restart	a container.	If	it	did,	that	would	cause	more	problems	than	it solved.	Imagine	a	container	that	does	nothing	but	print	the time	and	exit.	If	that	container	was	configured	to	always restart,	and	Docker	always	immediately	restarted	it,	the	system would	do	nothing	but	restart	that	container.	Instead,	Docker uses	an	exponential	backoff	strategy	for	timing	restart attempts.  A	backoff	strategy	determines	the	amount	of	time	that	should pass	between	successive	restart	attempts.	An	exponential back-off	strategy	will	do	something	like	double	the	previous time	spent	waiting	on	each	successive	attempt.	For	example,	if the	first	time	the	container	needs	to	be	restarted	Docker	waits 1	second,	then	on	the	second	attempt	it	would	wait	2	seconds, 4	seconds	on	the	third	attempt,	8	on	the	fourth,	and	so	on. Exponential	backoff	strategies	with	low	initial	wait	times	are	a common	service-restoration	technique.	You	can	see	Docker employ	this	strategy	yourself	by	building	a	container	that always	restarts	and	simply	prints	the	time:  docker	run	-d	--name	backoff-detector	--restart	always busybox:1.29	date   Then	after	a	few	seconds,	use	the	trailing	logs	feature	to	watch it	back	off	and	restart:  docker	logs	-f	backoff-detector  The	logs	will	show	all	the	times	it	has	already	been	restarted and	will	wait	until	the	next	time	it	is	restarted,	print	the	current time,	and	then	exit.	Adding	this	single	flag	to	the	monitoring system	and	the	WordPress	containers	you’ve	been	working	on would	solve	the	recovery	issue.  The	only	reason	you	might	not	want	to	adopt	this	directly	is that	during	backoff	periods,	the	container	isn’t	running. Containers	waiting	to	be	restarted	are	in	the	restarting	state.	To demonstrate,	try	to	run	another	process	in	the	backoff- detector	container:  docker	exec	backoff-detector	echo	Just	a	Test  Running	that	command	should	result	in	an	error	message:  Container	 	is	restarting,	wait	until	the	container	is running  That	means	you	can’t	do	anything	that	requires	the	container to	be	in	a	running	state,	such	as	execute	additional	commands in	the	container.	That	could	be	a	problem	if	you	need	to	run diagnostic	programs	in	a	broken	container.	A	more	complete strategy	is	to	use	containers	that	start	lightweight	init	systems.  2.5.2.	Using	PID	1	and	init	systems   An	init	system	is	a	program	that’s	used	to	launch	and	maintain the	state	of	other	programs.	Any	process	with	PID	1	is	treated like	an	init	process	by	the	Linux	kernel	 even	if	it	is	not technically	an	init	system .	In	addition	to	other	critical functions,	an	init	system	starts	other	processes,	restarts	them	in the	event	that	they	fail,	transforms	and	forwards	signals	sent by	the	operating	system,	and	prevents	resource	leaks.	It	is common	practice	to	use	real	init	systems	inside	containers when	that	container	will	run	multiple	processes	or	if	the program	being	run	uses	child	processes.  Several	such	init	systems	could	be	used	inside	a	container.	The most	popular	include	runit,	Yelp dumb-init,	tini, supervisord,	and	tianon gosu.	Publishing	software that	uses	these	programs	is	covered	in	chapter	8.	For	now,	take a	look	at	a	container	that	uses	supervisord.  Docker	provides	an	image	that	contains	a	full	LAMP	 Linux, Apache,	MySQL	PHP 	stack	inside	a	single	container. Containers	created	this	way	use	supervisord	to	make	sure that	all	the	related	processes	are	kept	running.	Start	an example	container:  docker	run	-d	-p	80:80	--name	lamp-test	tutum lamp  You	can	see	which	processes	are	running	inside	this	container by	using	the	docker	top	command:  docker	top	lamp-test  The	top	subcommand	will	show	the	host	PID	for	each	of	the   processes	in	the	container.	You’ll	see	supervisord, mysql,	and	apache	included	in	the	list	of	running	programs. Now	that	the	container	is	running,	you	can	test	the supervisord	restart	functionality	by	manually	stopping one	of	the	processes	inside	the	container.  The	problem	is	that	to	kill	a	process	inside	a	container	from within	that	container,	you	need	to	know	the	PID	in	the container’s	PID	namespace.	To	get	that	list,	run	the	following exec	subcommand:  docker	exec	lamp-test	ps  The	process	list	generated	will	list	apache2	in	the	CMD column:  PID	TTY										TIME	CMD 		1	?								00:00:00	supervisord 433	?								00:00:00	mysqld_safe 835	?								00:00:00	apache2 842	?								00:00:00	ps  The	values	in	the	PID	column	will	be	different	when	you	run the	command.	Find	the	PID	on	the	row	for	apache2	and	then insert	that	for	 	in	the	following	command:  docker	exec	lamp-test	kill	   Running	this	command	will	run	the	Linux	kill	program inside	the	lamp-test	container	and	tell	the	apache2 process	to	shut	down.	When	apache2	stops,	the supervisord	process	will	log	the	event	and	restart	the   process.	The	container	logs	will	clearly	show	these	events:  ... ...	exited:	apache2	 exit	status	0;	expected  ...	spawned:	'apache2'	with	pid	820 ...	success:	apache2	entered	RUNNING	state,	process	has	stayed up	for	> 						than	1	seconds	 startsecs   A	common	alternative	to	the	use	of	init	systems	is	using	a startup	script	that	at	least	checks	the	preconditions	for successfully	starting	the	contained	software.	These	are sometimes	used	as	the	default	command	for	the	container.	For example,	the	WordPress	containers	that	you’ve	created	start	by running	a	script	to	validate	and	set	default	environment variables	before	starting	the	WordPress	process.	You	can	view this	script	by	overriding	the	default	command	with	one	to	view the	contents	of	the	startup	script:  docker	run	wordpress:5.0.0-php7.2-apache	\ 		cat	 usr local bin docker-entrypoint.sh  Docker	containers	run	something	called	an	entrypoint	before executing	the	command.	Entrypoints	are	perfect	places	to	put code	that	validates	the	preconditions	of	a	container.	Although this	is	discussed	in	depth	in	part	2	of	this	book,	you	need	to know	how	to	override	or	specifically	set	the	entrypoint	of	a container	on	the	command	line.	Try	running	the	last	command again,	but	this	time	using	the	--entrypoint	flag	to	specify the	program	to	run	and	using	the	command	section	to	pass arguments:  docker	run	--entrypoint="cat"	\														1 				wordpress:5.0.0-php7.2-apache	\   				 usr local bin docker-entrypoint.sh						2  1	Uses	“cat”	as	the	entrypoint  2	Passes	the	full	path	of	the	default	entrypoint	script	as	an	argument to	cat  If	you	run	through	the	displayed	script,	you’ll	see	how	it validates	the	environment	variables	against	the	dependencies of	the	software	and	sets	default	values.	Once	the	script	has validated	that	WordPress	can	execute,	it	will	start	the requested	or	default	command.  Startup	scripts	are	an	important	part	of	building	durable containers	and	can	always	be	combined	with	Docker	restart policies	to	take	advantage	of	the	strengths	of	each.	Because both	the	MySQL	and	WordPress	containers	already	use	startup scripts,	it’s	appropriate	to	simply	set	the	restart	policy	for	each in	an	updated	version	of	the	example	script.  Running	startup	scripts	as	PID	1	is	problematic	when	the script	fails	to	meet	the	expectations	that	Linux	has	for	init systems.	Depending	on	your	use	case,	you	might	find	that	one approach	or	a	hybrid	works	best.  With	that	final	modification,	you’ve	built	a	complete WordPress	site-provisioning	system	and	learned	the	basics	of container	management	with	Docker.	It	has	taken	considerable experimentation.	Your	computer	is	likely	littered	with	several containers	that	you	no	longer	need.	To	reclaim	the	resources that	those	containers	are	using,	you	need	to	stop	them	and remove	them	from	your	system.   2.6.	CLEANING	UP  Ease	of	cleanup	is	one	of	the	strongest	reasons	to	use containers	and	Docker.	The	isolation	that	containers	provide simplifies	any	steps	that	you’d	have	to	take	to	stop	processes and	remove	files.	With	Docker,	the	whole	cleanup	process	is reduced	to	one	of	a	few	simple	commands.	In	any	cleanup task,	you	must	first	identify	the	container	that	you	want	to	stop and or	remove.	Remember,	to	list	all	the	containers	on	your computer,	use	the	docker	ps	command:  docker	ps	-a  Because	the	containers	you	created	for	the	examples	in	this chapter	won’t	be	used	again,	you	should	be	able	to	safely	stop and	remove	all	the	listed	containers.	Make	sure	you	pay attention	to	the	containers	you’re	cleaning	up	if	there	are	any that	you	created	for	your	own	activities.  All	containers	use	hard	drive	space	to	store	logs,	container metadata,	and	files	that	have	been	written	to	the	container filesystem.	All	containers	also	consume	resources	in	the	global namespace	such	as	container	names	and	host	port	mappings. In	most	cases,	containers	that	will	no	longer	be	used	should	be removed.  To	remove	a	container	from	your	computer,	use	the	docker rm	command.	For	example,	to	delete	the	stopped	container named	wp,	you’d	run	this:   docker	rm	wp  You	should	go	through	all	the	containers	in	the	list	you generated	by	running	docker	ps	-a	and	remove	all containers	that	are	in	the	exited	state.	If	you	try	to	remove	a container	that’s	running,	paused,	or	restarting,	Docker	will display	a	message	like	the	following:  Error	response	from	daemon:	Conflict,	You	cannot	remove	a running container.	Stop	the	container	before	attempting	removal	or	use -f FATA[0000]	Error:	failed	to	remove	one	or	more	containers  The	processes	running	in	a	container	should	be	stopped	before the	files	in	the	container	are	removed.	You	can	do	this	with	the docker	stop	command	or	by	using	the	-f	flag	on docker	rm.	The	key	difference	is	that	when	you	stop	a process	by	using	the	-f	flag,	Docker	sends	a	SIG_KILL signal,	which	immediately	terminates	the	receiving	process.	In contrast,	using	docker	stop	will	send	a	SIG_HUP	signal. Recipients	of	SIG_HUP	have	time	to	perform	finalization	and cleanup	tasks.	The	SIG_KILL	signal	makes	for	no	such allowances	and	can	result	in	file	corruption	or	poor	network experiences.	You	can	issue	a	SIG_KILL	directly	to	a container	by	using	the	docker	kill	command.	But	you should	use	docker	kill	or	docker	rm	-f	only	if	you must	stop	the	container	in	less	than	the	standard	30-second maximum	stop	time.  In	the	future,	if	you’re	experimenting	with	short-lived containers,	you	can	avoid	the	cleanup	burden	by	specifying	--   rm	on	the	command.	Doing	so	will	automatically	remove	the container	as	soon	as	it	enters	the	exited	state.	For	example,	the following	command	will	write	a	message	to	the	screen	in	a new	BusyBox	container,	and	the	container	will	be	removed	as soon	as	it	exits:  docker	run	--rm	--name	auto-exit-test	busybox:1.29	echo	Hello World docker	ps	-a  In	this	case,	you	could	use	either	docker	stop	or	docker rm	to	properly	clean	up,	or	it	would	be	appropriate	to	use	the single-step	docker	rm	-f	command.	You	should	also	use the	-v	flag	for	reasons	that	will	be	covered	in	chapter	4.	The docker	CLI	makes	it	is	easy	to	compose	a	quick	cleanup command:  docker	rm	-vf	$ docker	ps	-a	-q   This	concludes	the	basics	of	running	software	in	containers. Each	chapter	in	the	remainder	of	part	1	will	focus	on	a	specific aspect	of	working	with	containers.	The	next	chapter	focuses on	installing	and	uninstalling	images,	understanding	how images	relate	to	containers,	and	working	with	container filesystems.   SUMMARY  The	primary	focus	of	the	Docker	project	is	to	enable	users	to run	software	in	containers.	This	chapter	shows	how	you	can use	Docker	for	that	purpose.	The	ideas	and	features	covered include	the	following:  Containers	can	be	run	with	virtual	terminals	attached	to	the	user’s	shell	or in	detached	mode.  By	default,	every	Docker	container	has	its	own	PID	namespace,	isolating process	information	for	each	container.  Docker	identifies	every	container	by	its	generated	container	ID, abbreviated	container	ID,	or	its	human-friendly	name.  All	containers	are	in	any	one	of	six	distinct	states:	created,	running, restarting,	paused,	removing,	or	exited.  The	docker	exec	command	can	be	used	to	run	additional	processes inside	a	running	container.  A	user	can	pass	input	or	provide	additional	configuration	to	a	process	in	a container	by	specifying	environment	variables	at	container-creation	time.  Using	the	--read-only	flag	at	container-creation	time	will	mount	the container	filesystem	as	read-only	and	prevent	specialization	of	the container.  A	container	restart	policy,	set	with	the	--restart	flag	at	container- creation	time,	will	help	your	systems	automatically	recover	in	the	event	of a	failure.  Docker	makes	cleaning	up	containers	with	the	docker	rm	command	as simple	as	creating	them.   Chapter	3.	Software	installation simplified  This	chapter	covers  Identifying	software  Finding	and	installing	software	with	Docker	Hub  Installing	software	from	alternative	sources  Understanding	filesystem	isolation  Working	with	images	and	layers  Chapters	1	and	2	introduced	new	concepts	and	abstractions provided	by	Docker.	This	chapter	dives	deeper	into	container filesystems	and	software	installation.	It	breaks	software installation	into	three	steps,	as	illustrated	in	figure	3.1.  Figure	3.1.	Flow	of	topics	covered	in	this	chapter  The	first	step	in	installing	any	software	is	identifying	the software	you	want	to	install.	You	know	that	software	is distributed	using	images,	but	you	need	to	know	how	to	tell Docker	exactly	which	image	you	want	to	install.	We’ve already	mentioned	that	repositories	hold	images,	but	this chapter	shows	how	repositories	and	tags	are	used	to	identify images	in	order	to	install	the	software	you	want.   This	chapter	details	the	three	main	ways	to	install	Docker images:  Using	Docker	registries  Using	image	files	with	docker	save	and	docker	load  Building	images	with	Dockerfiles  In	the	course	of	reading	this	material,	you’ll	learn	how	Docker isolates	installed	software	and	you’ll	be	exposed	to	a	new term,	layer.	Layers,	an	important	concept	when	dealing	with images,	provide	multiple	important	features.	This	chapter closes	with	a	section	about	how	images	work.	That	knowledge will	help	you	evaluate	image	quality	and	establish	a	baseline skillset	for	part	2	of	this	book.   3.1.	IDENTIFYING	SOFTWARE  Suppose	you	want	to	install	a	program	called TotallyAwesomeBlog	2.0.	How	would	you	tell	Docker	what you	want	to	install?	You	would	need	a	way	to	name	the program,	specify	the	version	that	you	want	to	use,	and	specify the	source	that	you	want	to	install	it	from.	Learning	how	to identify	specific	software	is	the	first	step	in	software installation,	as	illustrated	in	figure	3.2.  Figure	3.2.	Step	1—software	identification  You’ve	learned	that	Docker	creates	containers	from	images. An	image	is	a	file.	It	holds	files	that	will	be	available	to containers	created	from	it	and	metadata	about	the	image.	This metadata	contains	labels,	environment	variables,	default execution	context,	the	command	history	for	an	image,	and more.  Every	image	has	a	globally	unique	identifier.	You	can	use	that identifier	with	image	and	container	commands,	but	in	practice it’s	rare	to	actually	work	with	raw	image	identifiers.	They	are long,	unique	sequences	of	letters	and	numbers.	Each	time	a change	is	made	to	an	image,	the	image	identifier	changes. Image	identifiers	are	difficult	to	work	with	because	they’re unpredictable.	Instead,	users	work	with	named	repositories.   3.1.1.	What	is	a	named	repository?  A	named	repository	is	a	named	bucket	of	images.	The	name	is similar	to	a	URL.	A	repository’s	name	is	made	up	of	the	name of	the	host	where	the	image	is	located,	the	user	account	that owns	the	image,	and	a	short	name,	as	shown	in	figure	3.3.	For example,	later	in	this	chapter	you	will	install	an	image	from the	repository	named docker.io dockerinaction ch3_hello_registr y.  Figure	3.3.	The	Docker	image	repository	name  Just	as	there	can	be	several	versions	of	software,	a	repository can	hold	several	images.	Each	image	in	a	repository	is identified	uniquely	with	tags.	If	you	were	to	release	a	new version	of docker.io dockerinaction ch3_hello_registr y,	you	might	tag	it	v2	while	tagging	the	old	version	with	v1. If	you	wanted	to	download	the	old	version,	you	could specifically	identify	that	image	by	its	v1	tag.  In	chapter	2,	you	installed	an	image	from	the	NGINX   repository	on	Docker	Hub	that	was	identified	with	the latest	tag.	A	repository	name	and	tag	form	a	composite	key, or	a	unique	reference	made	up	of	a	combination	of	nonunique components.	In	that	example,	the	image	was	identified	by nginx:latest.	Although	identifiers	built	in	this	fashion may	occasionally	be	longer	than	raw	image	identifiers,	they’re predictable	and	communicate	the	intention	of	the	image.  3.1.2.	Using	tags  Tags	are	both	an	important	way	to	uniquely	identify	an	image and	a	convenient	way	to	create	useful	aliases.	Whereas	a	tag can	be	applied	to	only	a	single	image	in	a	repository,	a	single image	can	have	several	tags.	This	allows	repository	owners	to create	useful	versioning	or	feature	tags.  For	example,	the	Java	repository	on	Docker	Hub	maintains	the following	tags:	11-stretch,	11-jdk-stretch,	11.0- stretch,	11.0-jdk-stretch,	11.0.4-stretch,	and 11.0.4-jdk-stretch.	All	these	tags	are	applied	to	the same	image.	This	image	is	built	by	installing	the	current	Java 11	Development	Kit	 JDK 	into	a	Debian	Stretch	base	image. As	the	current	patch	version	of	Java	11	increases,	and	the maintainers	release	Java	11.0.5,	the	11.0.4	tag	will	be	replaced in	this	set	with	11.0.5.	If	you	care	about	which	minor	or	patch version	of	Java	11	you’re	running,	you	have	to	keep	up	with those	tag	changes.	If	you	just	want	to	make	sure	you’re	always running	the	most	recent	version	of	Java	11,	use	the	image tagged	with	11-stretch.	It	should	always	be	assigned	to the	newest	release	of	Java	11.	These	tags	give	users	great flexibility.   It’s	also	common	to	see	different	tags	for	images	with different	software	configurations.	For	example,	we’ve	released two	images	for	an	open	source	program	called	freegeoip.	It’s	a web	application	that	can	be	used	to	get	the	rough	geographical location	associated	with	a	network	address.	One	image	is configured	to	use	the	default	configuration	for	the	software. It’s	meant	to	run	by	itself	with	a	direct	link	to	the	world.	The second	is	configured	to	run	behind	a	web	load	balancer.	Each image	has	a	distinct	tag	that	allows	the	user	to	easily	identify the	image	with	the	features	required.  Tip  When	you’re	looking	for	software	to	install,	always	pay careful	attention	to	the	tags	offered	in	a	repository.	Many repositories	publish	multiple	releases	of	their	software, sometimes	on	multiple	operating	systems	or	in	full	or	slim versions	to	support	different	use	cases.	Consult	the	repository's documentation	for	specifics	of	what	the	repository's	tags	mean and	the	image	release	practices.  That	is	all	there	is	to	identifying	software	for	use	with	Docker. With	this	knowledge,	you’re	ready	to	start	looking	for	and installing	software	with	Docker.   3.2.	FINDING	AND	INSTALLING	SOFTWARE  You	can	identify	software	by	a	repository	name,	but	how	do you	find	the	repositories	that	you	want	to	install?	Discovering trustworthy	software	is	complex,	and	it	is	the	second	step	in learning	how	to	install	software	with	Docker,	as	shown	in figure	3.4.  Figure	3.4.	Step	2—locating	repositories  The	easiest	way	to	find	images	is	to	use	an	index.	Indexes	are search	engines	that	catalog	repositories.	There	are	several public	Docker	indexes,	but	by	default	docker	is	integrated with	an	index	named	Docker	Hub.  Docker	Hub	is	a	registry	and	index	with	a	web	user	interface run	by	Docker	Inc.	It’s	the	default	registry	and	index	used	by docker	and	is	located	at	the	host	docker.io.	When	you issue	a	docker	pull	or	docker	run	command	without specifying	an	alternative	registry,	Docker	will	default	to looking	for	the	repository	on	Docker	Hub.	Docker	Hub	makes Docker	more	useful	out	of	the	box.  Docker	Inc.	has	made	efforts	to	ensure	that	Docker	is	an	open ecosystem.	It	publishes	a	public	image	to	run	your	own registry,	and	the	docker	command-line	tool	can	be	easily   configured	to	use	alternative	registries.	Later	in	this	chapter, we	cover	alternative	image	installation	and	distribution	tools included	with	Docker.	But	first,	the	next	section	covers	how	to use	Docker	Hub	so	you	can	get	the	most	from	the	default toolset.  3.2.1.	Working	with	Docker	registries	from	the	command line  An	image	author	can	publish	images	to	a	registry	such	as Docker	Hub	in	two	ways:  Use	the	command	line	to	push	images	that	they	built	independently	and	on their	own	systems.  Make	a	Dockerfile	publicly	available	and	use	a	continuous	build	system	to publish	images.	Dockerfiles	are	scripts	for	building	images.	Images created	from	these	automated	builds	are	preferred	because	the	Dockerfile is	available	for	examination	prior	to	installing	the	image.  Most	registries	will	require	image	authors	to	authenticate before	publishing	and	enforce	authorization	checks	on	the repository	they	are	updating.	In	these	cases,	you	can	use	the docker	login	command	to	log	in	to	specific	registry servers	such	as	Docker	Hub.	Once	you’ve	logged	in,	you’ll	be able	to	pull	from	private	repositories,	tag	images	in	your repositories,	and	push	to	any	repository	that	you	control. Chapter	7	covers	tagging	and	pushing	images.  Running	docker	login	will	prompt	you	for	your Docker.com	credentials.	Once	you’ve	provided	them,	your command-line	client	will	be	authenticated,	and	you’ll	be	able to	access	your	private	repositories.	When	you’ve	finished working	with	your	account,	you	can	log	out	with	the	docker   logout	command.	If	you’re	using	a	different	registry,	you can	specify	the	server	name	as	an	argument	to	the	docker login	and	docker	logout	subcommands.  3.2.2.	Using	alternative	registries  Docker	makes	the	registry	software	available	for	anyone	to run.	Cloud	companies	including	AWS	and	Google	offer private	registries,	and	companies	that	use	Docker	EE	or	that use	the	popular	Artifactory	project	already	have	private registries.	Running	a	registry	from	open	source	components	is covered	in	chapter	8,	but	it’s	important	that	you	learn	how	to use	them	early.  Using	an	alternative	registry	is	simple.	It	requires	no additional	configuration.	All	you	need	is	the	address	of	the registry.	The	following	command	will	download	another “Hello,	World”	type	of	example	from	an	alternative	registry:  docker	pull	quay.io dockerinaction ch3_hello_registry:latest  The	registry	address	is	part	of	the	full	repository	specification covered	in	section	3.1.	The	full	pattern	is	as	follows:  [REGISTRYHOST:PORT ][USERNAME ]NAME[:TAG]  Docker	knows	how	to	talk	to	Docker	registries,	so	the	only difference	is	that	you	specify	the	registry	host.	In	some	cases, working	with	registries	will	require	an	authentication	step.	If you	encounter	a	situation	where	this	is	the	case,	consult	the documentation	or	the	group	that	configured	the	registry	to	find   out	more.	When	you’re	finished	with	the	hello-registry image	you	installed,	remove	it	with	the	following	command:  docker	rmi	quay.io dockerinaction ch3_hello_registry  Registries	are	powerful.	They	enable	a	user	to	relinquish control	of	image	storage	and	transportation.	But	running	your own	registry	can	be	complicated	and	may	create	a	potential single	point	of	failure	for	your	deployment	infrastructure.	If running	a	custom	registry	sounds	a	bit	complicated	for	your use	case,	and	third-party	distribution	tools	are	out	of	the question,	you	might	consider	loading	images	directly	from	a file.  3.2.3.	Working	with	images	as	files  Docker	provides	a	command	to	load	images	into	Docker	from a	file.	With	this	tool,	you	can	load	images	that	you	acquired through	other	channels.	Maybe	your	company	has	chosen	to distribute	images	through	a	central	file	server	or	some	type	of version-control	system.	Maybe	the	image	is	small	enough	that your	friend	just	sent	it	to	you	over	email	or	shared	it	via	flash drive.	However	you	came	upon	the	file,	you	can	load	it	into Docker	with	the	docker	load	command.  You’ll	need	an	image	file	to	load	before	we	can	show	you	the docker	load	command.	Because	it’s	unlikely	that	you have	an	image	file	lying	around,	we’ll	show	you	how	to	save one	from	a	loaded	image.	For	the	purposes	of	this	example, you’ll	pull	busybox:latest.	That	image	is	small	and	easy to	work	with.	To	save	that	image	to	a	file,	use	the	docker   save	command.	Figure	3.5	demonstrates	docker	save	by creating	a	file	from	BusyBox.  Figure	3.5.	Parts	of	the	pull	and	save	subcommands  We	used	the	.tar	filename	suffix	in	this	example	because	the docker	save	command	creates	TAR	archive	files.	You	can use	any	filename	you	want.	If	you	omit	the	–o	flag,	the resulting	file	will	be	streamed	to	the	terminal.  Tip  Other	ecosystems	that	use	TAR	archives	for	packing	define custom	file	extensions.	For	example,	Java	uses	.jar,	.war,	and .ear.	In	cases	like	these,	using	custom	file	extensions	can	help hint	at	the	purpose	and	content	of	the	archive.	Although	there   are	no	defaults	set	by	Docker	and	no	official	guidance	on	the matter,	you	may	find	using	a	custom	extension	useful	if	you work	with	these	files	often.  After	running	the	save	command,	the	docker	program	will terminate	unceremoniously.	Check	that	it	worked	by	listing	the contents	of	your	current	working	directory.	If	the	specified	file is	there,	use	this	command	to	remove	the	image	from	Docker:  docker	rmi	busybox  After	removing	the	image,	load	it	again	from	the	file	you created	by	using	the	docker	load	command.	As	with docker	save,	if	you	run	docker	load	without	the	–i command,	Docker	will	use	the	standard	input	stream	instead of	reading	the	archive	from	a	file:  docker	load	–i	myfile.tar  Once	you’ve	run	the	docker	load	command,	the	image should	be	loaded.	You	can	verify	this	by	running	the	docker images	command	again.	If	everything	worked	correctly, BusyBox	should	be	included	in	the	list.  Working	with	images	as	files	is	as	easy	as	working	with registries,	but	you	miss	out	on	all	the	nice	distribution	facilities that	registries	provide.	If	you	want	to	build	your	own distribution	tools,	or	you	already	have	something	else	in	place, it	should	be	trivial	to	integrate	with	Docker	by	using	these   commands.  Another	popular	project	distribution	pattern	uses	bundles	of files	with	installation	scripts.	This	approach	is	popular	with open	source	projects	that	use	public	version-control repositories	for	distribution.	In	these	cases,	you	work	with	a file,	but	the	file	is	not	an	image;	it	is	a	Dockerfile.  3.2.4.	Installing	from	a	Dockerfile  A	Dockerfile	is	a	script	that	describes	steps	for	Docker	to	take to	build	a	new	image.	These	files	are	distributed	along	with software	that	the	author	wants	to	be	put	into	an	image.	In	this case,	you’re	not	technically	installing	an	image.	Instead, you’re	following	instructions	to	build	an	image.	Working	with Dockerfiles	is	covered	in	depth	in	chapter	7.  Distributing	a	Dockerfile	is	similar	to	distributing	image	files. You’re	left	to	your	own	distribution	mechanisms.	A	common pattern	is	to	distribute	a	Dockerfile	with	software	from common	version-control	systems	like	Git	or	Mercurial.	If	you have	Git	installed,	you	can	try	this	by	running	an	example from	a	public	repository:  git	clone	https:  github.com dockerinaction ch3_dockerfile.git docker	build	-t	dia_ch3 dockerfile:latest	ch3_dockerfile  In	this	example,	you	copy	the	project	from	a	public	source repository	onto	your	computer	and	then	build	and	install	a Docker	image	by	using	the	Dockerfile	included	with	that project.	The	value	provided	to	the	-t	option	of	docker   build	is	the	repository	where	you	want	to	install	the	image. Building	images	from	Dockerfiles	is	a	light	way	to	move projects	around	that	fits	into	existing	workflows.  This	approach	has	two	disadvantages.	First,	depending	on	the specifics	of	the	project,	the	build	process	might	take	some time.	Second,	dependencies	may	drift	between	the	time	when the	Dockerfile	was	authored	and	when	an	image	is	built	on	a user’s	computer.	These	issues	make	distributing	build	files	less than	an	ideal	experience	for	a	user.	But	it	remains	popular	in spite	of	these	drawbacks.  When	you’re	finished	with	this	example,	make	sure	to	clean up	your	workspace:  docker	rmi	dia_ch3 dockerfile rm	-rf	ch3_dockerfile  3.2.5.	Using	Docker	Hub	from	the	website  If	you	have	yet	to	stumble	upon	it	while	browsing	the	Docker website,	you	should	take	a	moment	to	check	out https:  hub.docker.com.	Docker	Hub	lets	you	search	for repositories,	organizations,	or	specific	users.	User	and organization	profile	pages	list	the	repositories	that	the	account maintains,	recent	activity	on	the	account,	and	the	repositories that	the	account	has	starred.	On	repository	pages	you	can	see the	following:  General	information	about	the	image	provided	by	the	image	publisher  A	list	of	the	tags	available	in	the	repository  The	date	the	repository	was	created   The	number	of	times	it	has	been	downloaded  Comments	from	registered	users  Docker	Hub	is	free	to	join,	and	you’ll	need	an	account	later	in this	book.	When	you’re	signed	in,	you	can	star	and	comment on	repositories.	You	can	create	and	manage	your	own repositories.	We	will	do	that	in	part	2.	For	now,	just	get	a	feel for	the	site	and	what	it	has	to	offer.  Activity:	A	Docker	Hub	scavenger	hunt  It’s	good	to	practice	finding	software	on	Docker	Hub	by	using the	skills	you	learned	in	chapter	2.	This	activity	is	designed	to encourage	you	to	use	Docker	Hub	and	practice	creating containers.	You	will	also	be	introduced	to	three	new	options on	the	docker	run	command.  In	this	activity,	you’ll	create	containers	from	two	images	that are	available	through	Docker	Hub.	The	first	is	available	from the	dockerinaction ch3_ex2_hunt	repository.	In	that image,	you’ll	find	a	small	program	that	prompts	you	for	a password.	You	can	find	the	password	only	by	finding	and running	a	container	from	the	second	mystery	repository	on Docker	Hub.	To	use	the	programs	in	these	images,	you	need	to attach	your	terminal	to	the	containers	so	that	the	input	and output	of	your	terminal	are	connected	directly	to	the	running container.	The	following	command	demonstrates	how	to	do that	and	run	a	container	that	will	be	removed	automatically when	stopped:  docker	run	-it	--rm	dockerinaction ch3_ex2_hunt   When	you	run	this	command,	the	scavenger	hunt	program	will prompt	you	for	the	password.	If	you	know	the	answer	already, go	ahead	and	enter	it	now.	If	not,	just	enter	anything,	and	it will	give	you	a	hint.	At	this	point,	you	should	have	all	the	tools you	need	to	complete	the	activity.	The	following	diagram illustrates	what	you	need	to	do	from	this	point.  Still	stuck?	We	can	give	you	one	more	hint.	The	mystery repository	is	one	that	was	created	for	this	book.	Maybe	you should	try	searching	for	this	book’s	Docker	Hub	repositories. Remember,	repositories	are	named	with	a	username repository pattern.  When	you	get	the	answer,	pat	yourself	on	the	back	and	remove the	images	by	using	the	docker	rmi	command.	The commands	you	run	should	look	something	like	these:  docker	rmi	dockerinaction ch3_ex2_hunt docker	rmi	   If	you	were	following	the	examples	and	using	the	--rm option	on	your	docker	run	commands,	you	should	have	no   containers	to	clean	up.	You	learned	a	lot	in	this	example.	You found	a	new	image	on	Docker	Hub	and	used	the	docker run	command	in	a	new	way.	There’s	a	lot	to	know	about running	interactive	containers.	The	next	section	covers	that	in greater	detail.  Docker	Hub	is	by	no	means	the	only	source	for	software. Depending	on	the	goals	and	perspective	of	software publishers,	Docker	Hub	may	not	be	an	appropriate	distribution point.	Closed	source	or	proprietary	projects	may	not	want	to risk	publishing	their	software	through	a	third	party.	You	can install	software	in	three	other	ways:  You	can	use	alternative	repository	registries	or	run	your	own	registry.  You	can	manually	load	images	from	a	file.  You	can	download	a	project	from	some	other	source	and	build	an	image by	using	a	provided	Dockerfile.  All	three	options	are	viable	for	private	projects	or	corporate infrastructure.	The	next	few	subsections	cover	how	to	install software	from	each	alternative	source.	Chapter	9	covers Docker	image	distribution	in	detail.	After	reading	this	section, you	should	have	a	complete	picture	of	your	options	to	install software	with	Docker.	When	you	install	software,	you	should have	an	idea	about	what	is	in	the	software	package	and	the changes	being	made	to	your	computer.   3.3.	INSTALLATION	FILES	AND	ISOLATION  Understanding	how	images	are	identified,	discovered,	and installed	is	a	minimum	proficiency	for	a	Docker	user.	If	you understand	what	files	are	actually	installed	and	how	those	files are	built	and	isolated	at	runtime,	you’ll	be	able	to	answer	more difficult	questions	that	come	up	with	experience,	such	as these:  What	image	properties	factor	into	download	and	installation	speeds?  What	are	all	these	unnamed	images	that	are	listed	when	I	use	the	docker images	command?  Why	does	output	from	the	docker	pull	command	include	messages about	pulling	dependent	layers?  Where	are	the	files	that	I	wrote	to	my	container’s	filesystem?  Learning	this	material	is	the	third	and	final	step	to understanding	software	installation	with	Docker,	as	illustrated in	figure	3.6.  Figure	3.6.	Step	3—understanding	how	software	is	installed  So	far,	when	we’ve	written	about	installing	software,	we’ve used	the	term	image.	This	was	to	infer	that	the	software	you were	going	to	use	was	in	a	single	image	and	that	an	image	was contained	within	a	single	file.	Although	this	may	occasionally   be	accurate,	most	of	the	time	what	we’ve	been	calling	an image	is	actually	a	collection	of	image	layers.  A	layer	is	set	of	files	and	file	metadata	that	is	packaged	and distributed	as	an	atomic	unit.	Internally,	Docker	treats	each layer	like	an	image,	and	layers	are	often	called	intermediate images.	You	can	even	promote	a	layer	to	an	image	by	tagging it.	Most	layers	build	upon	a	parent	layer	by	applying filesystem	changes	to	the	parent.	For	example,	a	layer	might update	the	software	in	an	image	with	a	package	manager	by using,	for	example,	Debian’s	apt-get	update.	The resulting	image	contains	the	combined	set	of	files	from	the parent	and	the	layer	that	was	added.	It	is	easier	to	understand layers	when	you	see	them	in	action.  3.3.1.	Image	layers	in	action  In	this	example,	you’ll	install	the	two	images.	Both	depend	on Java	11.	The	applications	themselves	are	simple	“Hello, World”–style	programs.	We	want	you	to	keep	an	eye	on	what Docker	does	when	you	install	each.	You	should	notice	how long	it	takes	to	install	the	first	compared	to	the	second	and read	what	the	docker	pull	command	prints	to	the terminal.	When	an	image	is	being	installed,	you	can	watch Docker	determine	which	dependencies	it	needs	to	download and	then	see	the	progress	of	the	individual	image	layer downloads.	Java	is	great	for	this	example	because	the	layers are	quite	large,	and	that	will	give	you	a	moment	to	really	see Docker	in	action.  The	two	images	you’re	going	to	install	are   dockerinaction ch3_myapp	and	docker- inaction ch3_myotherapp.	You	should	just	use	the docker	pull	command	because	you	need	to	only	see	the images	install,	not	start	a	container	from	them.	Here	are	the commands	you	should	run:  docker	pull	dockerinaction ch3_myapp docker	pull	dockerinaction ch3_myotherapp  Did	you	see	it?	Unless	your	network	connection	is	far	better than	mine,	or	you	had	already	installed	OpenJDK	11.0.4	 slim  as	a	dependency	of	some	other	image,	the	download	of dockerinaction ch3_myapp	should	have	been	much slower	than	docker-inaction ch3_myotherapp.  When	you	installed	ch3_myapp,	Docker	determined	that	it needed	to	install	the	openjdk:11.0.4-jdk-slim	image because	it’s	the	direct	dependency	 parent	layer 	of	the requested	image.	When	Docker	went	to	install	that dependency,	it	discovered	the	dependencies	of	that	layer	and downloaded	those	first.	Once	all	the	dependencies	of	a	layer are	installed,	that	layer	is	installed.	Finally, openjdk:11.0.4-jdk-slim	was	installed,	and	then	the tiny	ch3_myapp	layer	was	installed.  When	you	issued	the	command	to	install	ch3_myotherapp, Docker	identified	that	openjdk:11.0.4-jdk-slim	was already	installed	and	immediately	installed	the	image	for ch3_myotherapp.	Since	the	second	application	shared almost	all	of	its	image	layers	with	the	first	application,	Docker had	much	less	to	do.	Installing	the	unique	layer	of   ch3_myotherapp	was	very	fast	because	less	than	one megabyte	of	data	was	transferred.	But	again,	to	the	user	it	was an	identical	process.  From	the	user	perspective,	this	ability	is	nice	to	have,	but	you wouldn’t	want	to	have	to	try	to	optimize	for	it.	Just	take	the benefits	where	they	happen	to	work	out.	From	the	perspective of	a	software	or	image	author,	this	ability	should	play	a	major factor	in	your	image	design.	Chapter	7	covers	this	in	more detail.  If	you	run	docker	images	now,	you’ll	see	the	following repositories	listed:  dockerinaction ch3_myapp  dockerinaction ch3_myotherapp  By	default,	the	docker	images	command	will	show	only repositories.	As	with	other	commands,	if	you	specify	the	-a flag,	the	list	will	include	every	installed	intermediate	image	or layer.	Running	docker	images	-a	will	show	a	list	that includes	several	repositories	and	may	also	include	some	listed as	 .	Unnamed	images	can	exist	for	several	reasons, such	as	building	an	image	without	tagging	it.	The	only	way	to refer	to	these	is	to	use	the	value	in	the	IMAGE	ID	column.  In	this	example,	you	installed	two	images.	Let’s	clean	them	up now.	You	can	do	so	more	easily	if	you	use	the	condensed docker	rmi	syntax:  docker	rmi	\ 				dockerinaction ch3_myapp	\ 				dockerinaction ch3_myotherapp   				dockerinaction ch3_myotherapp  The	docker	rmi	command	allows	you	to	specify	a	space- separated	list	of	images	to	be	removed.	This	comes	in	handy when	you	need	to	remove	a	small	set	of	images	after	an example.	We’ll	be	using	this	when	appropriate	throughout	the rest	of	the	examples	in	this	book.  3.3.2.	Layer	relationships  Images	maintain	parent child	relationships.	In	these relationships,	they	build	from	their	parents	and	form	layers. The	files	available	to	a	container	are	the	union	of	all	layers	in the	lineage	of	the	image	that	the	container	was	created	from. Images	can	have	relationships	with	any	other	image,	including images	in	different	repositories	with	different	owners.	The	two application	images	in	section	3.3.1	use	an	OpenJDK	11.0.4 image	as	their	parent.	The	OpenJDK	image’s	parent	is	a minimal	version	of	the	Debian	Linux	Buster	operating	system release.	Figure	3.7	illustrates	the	full	image	ancestry	of	both images	and	the	layers	contained	in	each	image.  Figure	3.7.	The	full	lineage	of	the	two	Docker	images	used	in	section	3.3.1   The	images	and	layers	in	figure	3.7	show	that	the	application images	will	inherit	three	layers	from	openjdk:11.0.4- jdk-slim	and	one	more	layer	from	debian:buster- slim.	The	three	layers	from	OpenJDK	contain	common libraries	and	dependencies	of	the	Java	11	software,	and	the Debian	image	contributes	a	minimal	operating	system toolchain.  An	image	is	named	when	its	author	tags	and	publishes	it.	A user	can	create	aliases,	as	you	did	in	chapter	2	by	using	the docker	tag	command.	Until	an	image	is	tagged,	the	only   way	to	refer	to	it	is	to	use	its	unique	identifier	 ID 	that	was generated	when	the	image	was	built.	In	figure	3.7,	the	parent image	of	the	OpenJDK	11.0.4	image	is	the	Debian	Buster	OS whose	ID	is	83ed3c583403.	The	Debian	image	authors tagged	and	published	this	image	as	debian:buster- slim.	The	figure	labels	these	images	with	the	first	12	digits	of their	image	ID,	a	common	convention.	Docker	truncates	the ID	from	65	 base	16 	digits	to	12	in	output	of	common commands	for	the	benefit	of	its	human	users.	Internally	and through	API	access,	Docker	uses	the	full	65.  Even	these	“slim”	Java	images	are	sizable	and	were	chosen	to illustrate	a	point.	At	the	time	of	this	writing,	the openjdk:11.0.4-jdk-slim	image	is	401	MB.	You	get some	space	savings	when	you	use	the	runtime-only	images, but	even	openjdk:11.0.4-jre-slim-buster	is	204 MB.	Because	Docker	uniquely	identifies	images	and	layers,	it is	able	to	recognize	shared	image	dependencies	between applications	and	avoid	downloading	those	dependencies	again. This	is	done	without	requiring	any	coordination	between applications	at	runtime,	only	build	time.	Chapter	10	discusses image	build	pipelines	in	depth.	Let’s	continue	by	examining container	filesystems.  3.3.3.	Container	filesystem	abstraction	and	isolation  Programs	running	inside	containers	know	nothing	about	image layers.	From	inside	a	container,	the	filesystem	operates	as though	it’s	not	running	in	a	container	or	operating	on	an image.	From	the	perspective	of	the	container,	it	has	exclusive copies	of	the	files	provided	by	the	image.	This	is	made   possible	with	something	called	a	union	file-system	 UFS .  Docker	uses	a	variety	of	union	filesystems	and	will	select	the best	fit	for	your	system.	The	details	of	how	the	union filesystem	works	are	beyond	what	you	need	to	know	to	use Docker	effectively.	A	union	filesystem	is	part	of	a	critical	set of	tools	that	combine	to	create	effective	filesystem	isolation. The	other	tools	are	MNT	namespaces	and	the	chroot	system call.  The	filesystem	is	used	to	create	mount	points	on	your	host’s filesystem	that	abstract	the	use	of	layers.	The	layers	created are	bundled	into	Docker	image	layers.	Likewise,	when	a Docker	image	is	installed,	its	layers	are	unpacked	and appropriately	configured	for	use	by	the	specific	filesystem provider	chosen	for	your	system.  The	Linux	kernel	provides	a	namespace	for	the	MNT	system. When	Docker	creates	a	container,	that	new	container	will	have its	own	MNT	namespace,	and	a	new	mount	point	will	be created	for	the	container	to	the	image.  Lastly,	chroot	is	used	to	make	the	root	of	the	image filesystem	the	root	in	the	container’s	context.	This	prevents anything	running	inside	the	container	from	referencing	any other	part	of	the	host	filesystem.  Using	chroot	and	MNT	namespaces	is	common	for container	technologies.	By	adding	a	union	filesystem	to	the recipe,	Docker	containers	have	several	benefits.   3.3.4.	Benefits	of	this	toolset	and	filesystem	structure  The	first	and	perhaps	most	important	benefit	of	this	approach is	that	common	layers	need	to	be	installed	only	once.	If	you install	any	number	of	images	and	they	all	depend	on	a common	layer,	that	common	layer	and	all	of	its	parent	layers will	need	to	be	downloaded	or	installed	only	once.	This	means you	might	be	able	to	install	several	specializations	of	a program	without	storing	redundant	files	on	your	computer	or downloading	redundant	layers.	By	contrast,	most	virtual machine	technologies	will	store	the	same	files	as	many	times as	you	have	redundant	virtual	machines	on	a	computer.  Second,	layers	provide	a	coarse	tool	for	managing dependencies	and	separating	concerns.	This	is	especially handy	for	software	authors,	and	chapter	7	talks	more	about this.	From	a	user	perspective,	this	benefit	will	help	you quickly	identify	what	software	you’re	running	by	examining which	images	and	layers	you’re	using.  Lastly,	it’s	easy	to	create	software	specializations	when	you can	layer	minor	changes	on	top	of	a	basic	image.	That’s another	subject	covered	in	detail	in	chapter	7.	Providing specialized	images	helps	users	get	exactly	what	they	need from	software	with	minimal	customization.	This	is	one	of	the best	reasons	to	use	Docker.  3.3.5.	Weaknesses	of	union	filesystems  Docker	selects	sensible	defaults	when	it	is	started,	but	no implementation	is	perfect	for	every	workload.	In	fact,	in	some   specific	use	cases,	you	should	pause	and	consider	using another	Docker	feature.  Different	filesystems	have	different	rules	about	file	attributes, sizes,	names,	and	characters.	Union	filesystems	are	in	a position	where	they	often	need	to	translate	between	the	rules of	different	filesystems.	In	the	best	cases,	they’re	able	to provide	acceptable	translations.	In	the	worst	cases,	features	are omitted.	For	example,	neither	Btrfs	nor	OverlayFS	provides support	for	the	extended	attributes	that	make	SELinux	work.  Union	filesystems	use	a	pattern	called	copy-on-write,	and	that makes	implementing	memory-mapped	files	 the	mmap	system call 	difficult.	Some	union	filesystems	provide implementations	that	work	under	the	right	conditions,	but	it may	be	a	better	idea	to	avoid	memory-mapping	files	from	an image.  The	backing	filesystem	is	another	pluggable	feature	of	Docker. You	can	determine	which	filesystem	your	installation	is	using with	the	info	subcommand.	If	you	want	to	specifically	tell Docker	which	filesystem	to	use,	do	so	with	the	--storage- driver	or	-s	option	when	you	start	the	Docker	daemon. Most	issues	that	arise	with	writing	to	the	union	filesystem	can be	addressed	without	changing	the	storage	provider.	These	can be	solved	with	volumes,	the	subject	of	chapter	4.   SUMMARY  The	task	of	installing	and	managing	software	on	a	computer presents	a	unique	set	of	challenges.	This	chapter	explains	how you	can	use	Docker	to	address	them.	The	core	ideas	and features	covered	by	this	chapter	are	as	follows:  Human	users	of	Docker	use	repository	names	to	communicate	which software	they	would	like	Docker	to	install.  Docker	Hub	is	the	default	Docker	registry.	You	can	find	software	on Docker	Hub	through	either	the	website	or	the	docker	command-line program.  The	docker	command-line	program	makes	it	simple	to	install	software that’s	distributed	through	alternative	registries	or	in	other	forms.  The	image	repository	specification	includes	a	registry	host	field.  The	docker	load	and	docker	save	commands	can	be	used	to	load and	save	images	from	TAR	archives.  Distributing	a	Dockerfile	with	a	project	simplifies	image	builds	on	user machines.  Images	are	usually	related	to	other	images	in	parent child	relationships. These	relationships	form	layers.	When	we	say	that	we	have	installed	an image,	we	are	saying	that	we	have	installed	a	target	image	and	each	image layer	in	its	lineage.  Structuring	images	with	layers	enables	layer	reuse	and	saves	bandwidth during	distribution	and	storage	space	on	your	computer	and	image distribution	servers.   Chapter	4.	Working	with	storage	and volumes  This	chapter	covers  Introducing	mount	points  How	to	share	data	between	the	host	and	a	container  How	to	share	data	between	containers  Using	temporary,	in-memory	filesystems  Managing	data	with	volumes  Advanced	storage	with	volume	plugins  At	this	point	in	the	book,	you’ve	installed	and	run	a	few programs.	You’ve	seen	a	few	toy	examples	but	haven’t	run anything	that	resembles	the	real	world.	The	difference	between the	examples	in	the	first	three	chapters	and	the	real	world	is that	in	the	real	world,	programs	work	with	data.	This	chapter introduces	Docker	volumes	and	strategies	that	you’ll	use	to manage	data	with	containers.  Consider	what	it	might	look	like	to	run	a	database	program inside	a	container.	You	would	package	the	software	with	the image,	and	when	you	start	the	container,	it	might	initialize	an empty	database.	When	programs	connect	to	the	database	and enter	data,	where	is	that	data	stored?	Is	it	in	a	file	inside	the container?	What	happens	to	that	data	when	you	stop	the container	or	remove	it?	How	would	you	move	your	data	if	you wanted	to	upgrade	the	database	program?	What	happens	to that	storage	on	a	cloud	machine	when	it	is	terminated?   Consider	another	situation	where	you’re	running	a	couple	of different	web	applications	inside	different	containers.	Where would	you	write	log	files	so	that	they	will	outlive	the container?	How	would	you	get	access	to	those	logs	to troubleshoot	a	problem?	How	can	other	programs	such	as	log digest	tools	get	access	to	those	files?  The	union	filesystem	is	not	appropriate	for	working	with	long- lived	data	or	sharing	data	between	containers,	or	a	container and	the	host.	The	answer	to	all	these	questions	involves managing	the	container	filesystem	and	mount	points.   4.1.	FILE	TREES	AND	MOUNT	POINTS  Unlike	other	operating	systems,	Linux	unifies	all	storage	into	a single	tree.	Storage	devices	such	as	disk	partitions	or	USB	disk partitions	are	attached	to	specific	locations	in	that	tree.	Those locations	are	called	mount	points.	A	mount	point	defines	the location	in	the	tree,	the	access	properties	to	the	data	at	that point	 for	example,	writability ,	and	the	source	of	the	data mounted	at	that	point	 for	example,	a	specific	hard	disk,	USB device,	or	memory-backed	virtual	disk .	Figure	4.1	depicts	a filesystem	constructed	from	multiple	storage	devices,	with each	device	mounted	to	a	specific	location	and	level	of	access.  Figure	4.1.	Storage	devices	attached	to	a	filesystem	tree	at	their	mount	point  Mount	points	allow	software	and	users	to	use	the	file	tree	in	a Linux	environment	without	knowing	exactly	how	that	tree	is mapped	into	specific	storage	devices.	This	is	particularly useful	in	container	environments.   Every	container	has	something	called	a	MNT	namespace	and	a unique	file	tree	root.	This	is	discussed	in	detail	in	chapter	6. For	now,	it	is	enough	to	understand	that	the	image	that	a container	is	created	from	is	mounted	at	that	container’s	file tree	root,	or	at	the	 	point,	and	that	every	container	has	a different	set	of	mount	points.  Logic	follows	that	if	different	storage	devices	can	be	mounted at	various	points	in	a	file	tree,	we	can	mount	nonimage-related storage	at	other	points	in	a	container	file	tree.	That	is	exactly how	containers	get	access	to	storage	on	the	host	filesystem	and share	storage	between	containers.  The	rest	of	this	chapter	elaborates	on	how	to	manage	storage and	the	mount	points	in	containers.	The	best	place	to	start	is	by understanding	the	three	most	common	types	of	storage mounted	into	containers:  Bind	mounts  In-memory	storage  Docker	volumes  These	storage	types	can	be	used	in	many	ways.	Figure	4.2 shows	an	example	of	a	container	filesystem	that	starts	with	the files	from	the	image,	adds	an	in-memory	tmpfs	at	 tmp, bind-mounts	a	configuration	file	from	the	host,	and	writes	logs into	a	Docker	volume	on	the	host.  Figure	4.2.	Example	of	common	container	storage	mounts   All	three	types	of	mount	points	can	be	created	using	the	-- mount	flag	on	the	docker	run	and	docker	create subcommands.   4.2.	BIND	MOUNTS  Bind	mounts	are	mount	points	used	to	remount	parts	of	a filesystem	tree	onto	other	locations.	When	working	with containers,	bind	mounts	attach	a	user-specified	location	on	the host	filesystem	to	a	specific	point	in	a	container	file	tree.	Bind mounts	are	useful	when	the	host	provides	a	file	or	directory that	is	needed	by	a	program	running	in	a	container,	or	when that	containerized	program	produces	a	file	or	log	that	is processed	by	users	or	programs	running	outside	containers.  Consider	the	example	in	figure	4.3.	Suppose	you’re	running	a web	server	that	depends	on	sensitive	configuration	on	the	host and	emits	access	logs	that	need	to	be	forwarded	by	your	log- shipping	system.	You	could	use	Docker	to	launch	the	web server	in	a	container	and	bind-mount	the	configuration location	as	well	as	the	location	where	you	want	the	web	server to	write	logs.  Figure	4.3.	Host	files	shared	as	a	bind-mount	volumes   You	can	try	this	for	yourself.	Create	a	placeholder	log	file	and create	a	special	NGINX	configuration	file	named example.conf.	Run	the	following	commands	to	create	and populate	the	files:  touch	~ example.log cat	>~ example.conf	<<EOF server	{ 		listen	80; 		server_name	localhost; 		access_log	 var log nginx custom.host.access.log	main; 		location	 	{ 				root	 usr share nginx html; 				index	index.html	index.htm; 		} } EOF  Once	a	server	is	started	with	this	configuration	file,	it	will offer	the	NGINX	default	site	at	http:  localhost ,	and	access logs	for	that	site	will	be	written	to	a	file	in	the	container	at    var log nginx custom.host.access.log.	The	following command	will	start	an	NGINX	HTTP	server	in	a	container where	your	new	configuration	is	bind-mounted	to	the	server’s configuration	root:  CONF_SRC=~ example.conf;	\ CONF_DST= etc nginx conf.d default.conf;	\ 	 LOG_SRC=~ example.log;	\ LOG_DST= var log nginx custom.host.access.log;	\ docker	run	-d	--name	diaweb	\ 		--mount	type=bind,src=${CONF_SRC},dst=${CONF_DST}	\ 		--mount	type=bind,src=${LOG_SRC},dst=${LOG_DST}	\ 		-p	80:80	\ 		nginx:latest  With	this	container	running,	you	should	be	able	to	point	your web	browser	at	http:  localhost 	and	see	the	NGINX	hello- world	page,	and	you	will	not	see	any	access	logs	in	the container	log	stream:	docker	logs	diaweb.	However, you	will	be	able	to	see	those	logs	if	you	examine	the example.log	file	in	your	home	directory:	cat ~ example.log.  In	this	example	you	used	the	--mount	option	with	the type=bind	option.	The	other	two	mount	parameters,	src and	dst,	define	the	source	location	on	the	host	file	tree	and the	destination	location	on	the	container	file	tree.	You	must specify	locations	with	absolute	paths,	but	in	this	example,	we used	shell	expansion	and	shell	variables	to	make	the	command easier	to	read.  This	example	touches	on	an	important	feature	of	volumes. When	you	mount	a	volume	on	a	container	filesystem,	it   replaces	the	content	that	the	image	provides	at	that	location. By	default,	the	nginx:latest	image	provides	some	default configuration	at	 etc nginx conf.d default.conf,	but	when	you created	the	bind	mount	with	a	destination	at	that	path,	the content	provided	by	the	image	was	overridden	by	the	content on	the	host.	This	behavior	is	the	basis	for	the	polymorphic container	pattern	discussed	later	in	the	chapter.  Expanding	on	this	use	case,	suppose	you	want	to	make	sure that	the	NGINX	web	server	can’t	change	the	contents	of	the configuration	volume.	Even	the	most	trusted	software	can contain	vulnerabilities,	and	it’s	best	to	minimize	the	impact	of an	attack	on	your	website.	Fortunately,	Linux	provides	a mechanism	to	make	mount	points	read-only.	You	can	do	this by	adding	the	readonly=true	argument	to	the	mount specification.	In	the	example,	you	should	change	the	run command	to	something	like	the	following:  docker	rm	-f	diaweb  CONF_SRC=~ example.conf;	\ CONF_DST= etc nginx conf.d default.conf;	\ LOG_SRC=~ example.log;	\ LOG_DST= var log nginx custom.host.access.log;	\ docker	run	-d	--name	diaweb	\ 		--mount	 type=bind,src=${CONF_SRC},dst=${CONF_DST},readonly=true	\					1 		--mount	type=bind,src=${LOG_SRC},dst=${LOG_DST}	\ 		-p	80:80	\ 		nginx:latest  1	Note	the	readonly	flag.  By	creating	the	read-only	mount,	you	can	prevent	any	process inside	the	container	from	modifying	the	content	of	the	volume. You	can	see	this	in	action	by	running	a	quick	test:   docker	exec	diaweb	\ 				sed	-i	"s listen	80 listen	8080 "  etc nginx conf.d default.conf  This	command	executes	a	sed	command	inside	the	diaweb container	and	attempts	to	modify	the	configuration	file.	The command	fails	because	the	file	is	mounted	as	read-only.  The	first	problem	with	bind	mounts	is	that	they	tie	otherwise portable	container	descriptions	to	the	filesystem	of	a	specific host.	If	a	container	description	depends	on	content	at	a	specific location	on	the	host	filesystem,	that	description	isn’t	portable to	hosts	where	the	content	is	unavailable	or	available	in	some other	location.  The	next	big	problem	is	that	they	create	an	opportunity	for conflict	with	other	containers.	It	would	be	a	bad	idea	to	start multiple	instances	of	Cassandra	that	all	use	the	same	host location	as	a	bind	mount	for	data	storage.	In	that	case,	each	of the	instances	would	compete	for	the	same	set	of	files.	Without other	tools	such	as	file	locks,	that	would	likely	result	in corruption	of	the	database.  Bind	mounts	are	appropriate	tools	for	workstations,	machines with	specialized	concerns,	or	in	systems	combined	with	more traditional	configuration	management	tooling.	It’s	better	to avoid	these	kinds	of	specific	bindings	in	generalized	platforms or	hardware	pools.   4.3.	IN-MEMORY	STORAGE  Most	service	software	and	web	applications	use	private	key files,	database	passwords,	API	key	files,	or	other	sensitive configuration	files,	and	need	upload	buffering	space.	In	these cases,	it	is	important	that	you	never	include	those	types	of	files in	an	image	or	write	them	to	disk.	Instead,	you	should	use	in- memory	storage.	You	can	add	in-memory	storage	to	containers with	a	special	type	of	mount.  Set	the	type	option	on	the	mount	flag	to	tmpfs.	This	is	the easiest	way	to	mount	a	memory-based	filesystem	into	a container’s	file	tree.	Consider	this	command:  docker	run	--rm	\ 				--mount	type=tmpfs,dst= tmp	\ 				--entrypoint	mount	\ 				alpine:latest	-v  This	command	creates	an	empty	tmpfs	device	and	attaches	it to	the	new	container’s	file	tree	at	 tmp.	Any	files	created	under this	file	tree	will	be	written	to	memory	instead	of	disk.	More than	that,	the	mount	point	is	created	with	sensible	defaults	for generic	workloads.	Running	the	command	will	display	a	list	of all	the	mount	points	for	the	container.	The	list	will	include	the following	line:  tmpfs	on	 tmp	type	tmpfs	 rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime   This	line	describes	the	mount-point	configuration.	From	left-   to-right	it	indicates	the	following:  A	tmpfs	device	is	mounted	to	the	tree	at	 tmp.  The	device	has	a	tmpfs	filesystem.  The	tree	is	read write	capable.  suid	bits	will	be	ignored	on	all	files	in	this	tree.  No	files	in	this	tree	will	be	interpreted	as	special	devices.  No	files	in	this	tree	will	be	executable.  File	access	times	will	be	updated	if	they	are	older	than	the	current	modify or	change	time.  Additionally,	the	tmpfs	device	will	not	have	any	size	limits by	default	and	will	be	world-writable	 has	file	permissions 1777	in	octal .	You	can	add	a	size	limit	and	change	the	file mode	with	two	additional	options:	tmpfs-size	and tmpfs-mode:  docker	run	--rm	\ 				--mount	type=tmpfs,dst= tmp,tmpfs-size=16k,tmpfs-mode=1770 \ 				--entrypoint	mount	\ 				alpine:latest	-v  This	command	limits	the	tmpfs	device	mounted	at	 tmp	to	16 KB	and	is	not	readable	by	other	in-container	users.   4.4.	DOCKER	VOLUMES  Docker	volumes	are	named	filesystem	trees	managed	by Docker.	They	can	be	implemented	with	disk	storage	on	the host	filesystem,	or	another	more	exotic	backend	such	as	cloud storage.	All	operations	on	Docker	volumes	can	be accomplished	using	the	docker	volume	subcommand	set. Using	volumes	is	a	method	of	decoupling	storage	from specialized	locations	on	the	filesystem	that	you	might	specify with	bind	mounts.  If	you	were	to	convert	the	web	server	and	log-forwarding container	example	from	section	4.2	to	use	a	volume	for sharing	access	to	the	logs,	the	pair	could	run	on	any	machine without	considering	other	software	that	might	have	a	conflict with	static	locations	on	disk.	That	example	would	look	like figure	4.4,	and	the	containers	would	read	and	write	logs through	the	location-example	volume.  Figure	4.4.	Sharing	files	between	containers	with	a	volume   You	can	create	and	inspect	volumes	by	using	the	docker volume	create	and	docker	volume	inspect subcommands.	By	default,	Docker	creates	volumes	by	using the	local	volume	plugin.	The	default	behavior	will	create	a directory	to	store	the	contents	of	a	volume	somewhere	in	a	part of	the	host	filesystem	under	control	of	the	Docker	engine.	For example,	the	following	two	commands	will	create	a	volume named	location-example	and	display	the	location	of	the volume	host	filesystem	tree:  docker	volume	create	\																1 				--driver	local	\																		2 				--label	example=location	\								3 				location-example docker	volume	inspect	\															4 				--format	"{{json	.Mountpoint}}"	\	5 				location-example  1	Creates	the	volume   2	Specifies	the	“local”	plugin  3	Adds	a	volume	label  4	Inspects	the	volume  5	Selects	the	location	on	the	host  Docker	volumes	may	seem	difficult	to	work	with	if	you’re manually	building	or	linking	tools	together	on	your	desktop, but	for	larger	systems	in	which	specific	locality	of	the	data	is less	important,	volumes	are	a	much	more	effective	way	to organize	your	data.	Using	them	decouples	volumes	from	other potential	concerns	of	the	system.	By	using	Docker	volumes, you’re	simply	stating,	“I	need	a	place	to	put	some	data	that	I’m working	with.”	This	is	a	requirement	that	Docker	can	fill	on any	machine	with	Docker	installed.  Further,	when	you’re	finished	with	a	volume	and	you	ask Docker	to	clean	things	up	for	you,	Docker	can	confidently remove	any	directories	or	files	that	are	no	longer	being	used by	a	container.	Using	volumes	in	this	way	helps	manage clutter.	As	Docker	middleware	or	plugins	evolve,	volume users	will	be	able	to	adopt	more	advanced	features.  Sharing	access	to	data	is	a	key	feature	of	volumes.	If	you	have decoupled	volumes	from	known	locations	on	the	filesystem, you	need	to	know	how	to	share	volumes	between	containers without	exposing	the	exact	location	of	managed	containers. The	next	section	describes	two	ways	to	share	data	between containers	by	using	volumes.  4.4.1.	Volumes	provide	container-independent	data management   Semantically,	a	volume	is	a	tool	for	segmenting	and	sharing data	that	has	a	scope	or	life	cycle	that’s	independent	of	a single	container.	That	makes	volumes	an	important	part	of	any containerized	system	design	that	shares	or	writes	files. Examples	of	data	that	differs	in	scope	or	access	from	a container	include	the	following:  Database	software	versus	database	data  Web	application	versus	log	data  Data	processing	application	versus	input	and	output	data  Web	server	versus	static	content  Products	versus	support	tools  Volumes	enable	separation	of	concerns	and	create	modularity for	architectural	components.	That	modularity	helps	you understand,	build,	support,	and	reuse	parts	of	larger	systems more	easily.  Think	about	it	this	way:	images	are	appropriate	for	packaging and	distributing	relatively	static	files	such	as	programs; volumes	hold	dynamic	data	or	specializations.	This	distinction makes	images	reusable	and	data	simple	to	share.	This separation	of	relatively	static	and	dynamic	file	space	allows application	or	image	authors	to	implement	advanced	patterns such	as	polymorphic	and	composable	tools.  A	polymorphic	tool	is	one	that	maintains	a	consistent	interface but	might	have	several	implementations	that	do	different things.	Consider	an	application	such	as	a	general	application server.	Apache	Tomcat,	for	example,	is	an	application	that provides	an	HTTP	interface	on	a	network	and	dispatches	any   requests	it	receives	to	pluggable	programs.	Tomcat	has polymorphic	behavior.	Using	volumes,	you	can	inject	behavior into	containers	without	modifying	an	image.	Alternatively, consider	a	database	program	like	MongoDB	or	MySQL.	The value	of	a	database	is	defined	by	the	data	it	contains.	A database	program	always	presents	the	same	interface	but	takes on	a	wholly	different	value	depending	on	the	data	that	can	be injected	with	a	volume.	The	polymorphic	container	pattern	is the	subject	of	section	4.5.1.  More	fundamentally,	volumes	enable	the	separation	of application	and	host	concerns.	At	some	point,	an	image	will	be loaded	onto	a	host	and	a	container	created	from	it.	Docker knows	little	about	the	host	where	it’s	running	and	can	make assertions	only	about	what	files	should	be	available	to	a container.	Docker	alone	has	no	way	to	take	advantage	of	host- specific	facilities	like	mounted	network	storage	or	mixed spinning	and	solid-state	hard	drives.	But	a	user	with knowledge	of	the	host	can	use	volumes	to	map	directories	in	a container	to	appropriate	storage	on	that	host.  Now	that	you’re	familiar	with	what	volumes	are	and	why they’re	important,	you	can	get	started	with	them	in	a	real- world	example.  4.4.2.	Using	volumes	with	a	NoSQL	database  The	Apache	Cassandra	project	provides	a	column	database with	built-in	clustering,	eventual	consistency,	and	linear	write scalability.	It’s	a	popular	choice	in	modern	system	designs, and	an	official	image	is	available	on	Docker	Hub.	Cassandra	is   like	other	databases	in	that	it	stores	its	data	in	files	on	disk.	In this	section,	you’ll	use	the	official	Cassandra	image	to	create	a single-node	Cassandra	cluster,	create	a	keyspace,	delete	the container,	and	then	recover	that	keyspace	on	a	new	node	in another	container.  Get	started	by	creating	the	volume	that	will	store	the Cassandra	database	files.	This	volume	uses	disk	space	on	the local	machine	and	in	a	part	of	the	filesystem	managed	by	the Docker	engine:  docker	volume	create	\ 				--driver	local	\ 				--label	example=cassandra	\ 				cass-shared  This	volume	is	not	associated	with	any	containers;	it	is	just	a named	bit	of	disk	that	can	be	accessed	by	containers.	The volume	you	just	created	is	named	cass-shared.	In	this case,	you	added	a	label	to	the	volume	with	the	key	example and	the	value	cassandra.	Adding	label	metadata	to	your volumes	can	help	you	organize	and	clean	up	volumes	later. You’ll	use	this	volume	when	you	create	a	new	container running	Cassandra:  docker	run	-d	\ 				--volume	cass-shared: var lib cassandra data	\						1 				--name	cass1	\ 				cassandra:2.2  1	Mounts	the	volume	into	the	container  After	Docker	pulls	the	cassandra:2.2	image	from	Docker Hub,	it	creates	a	new	container	with	the	cass-shared   volume	mounted	at	 var lib cassandra data.	Next,	start	a container	from	the	cassandra:2.2	image,	but	run	a Cassandra	client	tool	 CQLSH 	and	connect	to	your	running server:  docker	run	-it	--rm	\ 				--link	cass1:cass	\ 				cassandra:2.2	cqlsh	cass  Now	you	can	inspect	or	modify	your	Cassandra	database	from the	CQLSH	command	line.	First,	look	for	a	keyspace	named docker_hello_world:  select	* from	system.schema_keyspaces where	keyspace_name	=	'docker_hello_world';  Cassandra	should	return	an	empty	list.	This	means	the database	hasn’t	been	modified	by	the	example.	Next,	create that	keyspace	with	the	following	command:  create	keyspace	docker_hello_world with	replication	=	{ 				'class'	:	'SimpleStrategy', 				'replication_factor':	1 };  Now	that	you’ve	modified	the	database,	you	should	be	able	to issue	the	same	query	again	to	see	the	results	and	verify	that your	changes	were	accepted.	The	following	command	is	the same	as	the	one	you	ran	earlier:  select	* from	system.schema_keyspaces where	keyspace_name	=	'docker_hello_world';   This	time,	Cassandra	should	return	a	single	entry	with	the properties	you	specified	when	you	created	the	keyspace.	If you’re	satisfied	that	you’ve	connected	to	and	modified	your Cassandra	node,	quit	the	CQLSH	program	to	stop	the	client container:  	Leave	and	stop	the	current	container quit  The	client	container	was	created	with	the	--rm	flag	and	was automatically	removed	when	the	command	stopped.	Continue cleaning	up	the	first	part	of	this	example	by	stopping	and removing	the	Cassandra	node	you	created:  docker	stop	cass1 docker	rm	-vf	cass1  Both	the	Cassandra	client	and	server	you	created	will	be deleted	after	running	those	commands.	If	the	modifications you	made	are	persisted,	the	only	place	they	could	remain	is	the cass-shared	volume.	You	can	test	this	by	repeating	these steps.	Create	a	new	Cassandra	node,	attach	a	client,	and	query for	the	keyspace.	Figure	4.5	illustrates	the	system	and	what you	will	have	built.  Figure	4.5.	Key	steps	in	creating	and	recovering	data	persisted	to	a	volume	with	Cassandra   The	next	three	commands	test	recovery	of	the	data:  docker	run	-d	\ 				--volume	cass-shared: var lib cassandra data	\ 				--name	cass2	\ 				cassandra:2.2 	 docker	run	-it	--rm	\ 				--link	cass2:cass	\ 				cassandra:2.2	\ 				cqlsh	cass 	 select	* from	system.schema_keyspaces where	keyspace_name	=	'docker_hello_world';  The	last	command	in	this	set	returns	a	single	entry,	and	it matches	the	keyspace	you	created	in	the	previous	container. This	confirms	the	previous	claims	and	demonstrates	how volumes	might	be	used	to	create	durable	systems.	Before moving	on,	quit	the	CQLSH	program	and	clean	up	your workspace.	Make	sure	to	remove	that	volume	container	as well:  quit 	 docker	rm	-vf	cass2	cass-shared   This	example	demonstrates	one	way	to	use	volumes	without going	into	how	they	work,	the	patterns	in	use,	or	how	to manage	volume	life	cycle.	The	remainder	of	this	chapter	dives deeper	into	each	facet	of	volumes,	starting	with	the	types available.   4.5.	SHARED	MOUNT	POINTS	AND	SHARING	FILES  Sharing	access	to	the	same	set	of	files	between	multiple containers	is	where	the	value	of	volumes	becomes	most obvious.	Compare	the	bind-mount	and	volume-based approaches.  Bind	mounts	are	the	most	obvious	way	to	share	disk	space between	containers.	You	can	see	it	in	action	in	the	following example:  LOG_SRC=~ web-logs-example mkdir	${LOG_SRC}																																				1  docker	run	--name	plath	-d	\																								2 				--mount	type=bind,src=${LOG_SRC},dst= data	\				2 				dockerinaction ch4_writer_a																					2  docker	run	--rm	\ 				--mount	type=bind,src=${LOG_SRC},dst= data	\				3 				alpine:latest	\																																	3 				head	 data logA																																	3  cat	${LOG_SRC} logA																																	4  docker	rm	-f	plath																																		5  1	Sets	up	a	known	location  2	Bind-mounts	the	location	into	a	log-writing	container  3	Bind-mounts	the	same	location	into	a	container	for	reading  4	Views	the	logs	from	the	host  5	Stops	the	writer  In	this	example,	you	created	two	containers:	one	named plath	that	writes	lines	to	a	file	and	another	that	views	the	top   part	of	the	file.	These	containers	share	a	common	bind-mount definition.	Outside	any	container,	you	can	see	the	changes	by listing	the	contents	of	the	directory	you	created	or	viewing	the new	file.	The	major	drawback	to	this	approach	is	that	all containers	involved	must	agree	on	the	exact	location	on	the host	file	path,	and	they	may	conflict	with	other	containers	that also	intend	to	read	or	manipulate	files	at	that	location.  Now	compare	that	bind-mount	example	with	an	example	that uses	volumes.	The	following	commands	are	equivalent	to	the prior	example	but	have	no	host-specific	dependencies:  docker	volume	create	\																																						1 				--driver	local	\																																								1 				logging-example																																									1  docker	run	--name	plath	-d	\																																2 				--mount	type=volume,src=logging-example,dst= data	\					2 				dockerinaction ch4_writer_a																													2  docker	run	--rm	\ 				--mount	type=volume,src=logging-example,dst= data	\					3 				alpine:latest	\																																									3 				head	 data logA																																									3  cat	"$ docker	volume	inspect	\ 				--format	"{{json	.Mountpoint}}"	logging-example " logA		4  docker	stop	plath																																											5  1	Sets	up	a	named	volume  2	Mounts	the	volume	into	a	log-writing	container  3	Mounts	the	same	volume	into	a	container	for	reading  4	Views	the	logs	from	the	host  5	Stops	the	writer  Unlike	shares	based	on	bind	mounts,	named	volumes	enable   containers	to	share	files	without	any	knowledge	of	the underlying	host	filesystem.	Unless	the	volume	needs	to	use specific	settings	or	plugins,	it	does	not	have	to	exist	before	the first	container	mounts	it.	Docker	will	automatically	create volumes	named	in	run	or	create	commands	by	using	the defaults.	However,	it	is	important	to	remember	that	a	named volume	that	exists	on	the	host	will	be	reused	and	shared	by any	other	containers	with	the	same	volume	dependency.  This	name	conflict	problem	can	be	solved	by	using anonymous	volumes	and	mount-point	definition	inheritance between	containers.  4.5.1.	Anonymous	volumes	and	the	volumes-from	flag  An	anonymous	volume	is	created	without	a	name	either	before use	with	the	docker	volume	create	subcommand,	or just	in	time	with	defaults	using	a	docker	run	or	docker create	command.	When	the	volume	is	created,	it	is	assigned a	unique	identifier	such	as 1b3364a8debb5f653d1ecb9b190000622549ee2f81 2a4fb4ec8a83c43d87531b	instead	of	a	human-friendly name.	These	are	more	difficult	to	work	with	if	you	are manually	stitching	together	dependencies,	but	they	are	useful when	you	need	to	eliminate	potential	volume-naming conflicts.	The	Docker	command	line	provides	another	way	to specify	mount	dependencies	instead	of	referencing	volumes	by name.  The	docker	run	command	provides	a	flag,	--volumes- from,	that	will	copy	the	mount	definitions	from	one	or	more   containers	to	the	new	container.	It	can	be	set	multiple	times	to specify	multiple	source	containers.	By	combining	this	flag	and anonymous	volumes,	you	can	build	rich	shared-state relationships	in	a	host-independent	way.	Consider	the following	example:  docker	run	--name	fowler	\ 				--mount	type=volume,dst= library PoEAA	\ 				--mount	type=bind,src= tmp,dst= library DSL	\ 				alpine:latest	\ 				echo	"Fowler	collection	created." docker	run	--name	knuth	\ 				--mount	type=volume,dst= library TAoCP.vol1	\ 				--mount	type=volume,dst= library TAoCP.vol2	\ 				--mount	type=volume,dst= library TAoCP.vol3	\ 				--mount	type=volume,dst= library TAoCP.vol4.a	\ 				alpine:latest	\ 				echo	"Knuth	collection	created"  docker	run	--name	reader	\																										1 				--volumes-from	fowler	\																									1 				--volumes-from	knuth	\																										1 				alpine:latest	ls	-l	 library   docker	inspect	--format	"{{json	.Mounts}}"	reader			2  1	Lists	all	volumes	as	they	were	copied	into	new	container  2	Checks	out	volume	list	for	reader  In	this	example,	you	created	two	containers	that	defined anonymous	volumes	as	well	as	a	bind-mount	volume.	To	share these	with	a	third	container	without	the	--volumes-from flag,	you’d	need	to	inspect	the	previously	created	containers and	then	craft	bind-mount	volumes	to	the	Docker-managed host	directories.	Docker	does	all	this	on	your	behalf	when	you use	the	--volumes-from	flag.	It	copies	all	mount-point definitions	present	on	a	referenced	source	container	into	the new	container.	In	this	case,	the	container	named	reader   copied	all	the	mount	points	defined	by	both	fowler	and knuth.  You	can	copy	volumes	directly	or	transitively.	This	means	that if	you’re	copying	the	volumes	from	another	container,	you’ll also	copy	the	volumes	that	it	copied	from	some	other container.	Using	the	containers	created	in	the	preceding example	yields	the	following:  docker	run	--name	aggregator	\					1 				--volumes-from	fowler	\ 				--volumes-from	knuth	\ 				alpine:latest	\ 				echo	"Collection	Created."  docker	run	--rm	\																		2 				--volumes-from	aggregator	\ 				alpine:latest	\ 				ls	-l	 library   1	Creates	an	aggregation  2	Consumes	volumes	from	a	single	source	and	lists	them  Copied	volumes	always	have	the	same	mount	point.	That means	that	you	can’t	use	--volumes-from	in	three situations.  In	the	first	situation,	you	can’t	use	--volumes-from	if	the container	you’re	building	needs	a	shared	volume	mounted	to	a different	location.	It	offers	no	tooling	for	remapping	mount points.	It	will	only	copy	and	union	the	mount	points	indicated by	the	specified	containers.	For	example,	if	the	student	in	the previous	example	wanted	to	mount	the	library	to	a	location like	 school library,	they	wouldn’t	be	able	to	do	so.   The	second	situation	occurs	when	the	volume	sources	conflict with	each	other	or	a	new	volume	specification.	If	one	or	more sources	create	a	managed	volume	with	the	same	mount	point, a	consumer	of	both	will	receive	only	one	of	the	volume definitions:  docker	run	--name	chomsky	--volume	 library ss	\ 				alpine:latest	echo	"Chomsky	collection	created." docker	run	--name	lamport	--volume	 library ss	\ 				alpine:latest	echo	"Lamport	collection	created." 	 docker	run	--name	student	\ 				--volumes-from	chomsky	--volumes-from	lamport	\ 				alpine:latest	ls	-l	 library  	 docker	inspect	-f	"{{json	.Mounts}}"	student  When	you	run	the	example,	the	output	of	docker	inspect will	show	that	the	last	container	has	only	a	single	volume listed	at	 library ss,	and	its	value	is	the	same	as	one	of	the other	two.	Each	source	container	defines	the	same	mount point,	and	you	create	a	race	condition	by	copying	both	to	the new	container.	Only	one	of	the	two	copy	operations	can succeed.  A	real-world	example	of	this	limitation	may	occur	if	you	copy the	volumes	of	several	web	servers	into	a	single	container	for inspection.	If	those	servers	are	all	running	the	same	software or	share	common	configuration	 which	is	more	likely	than	not in	a	containerized	system ,	all	those	servers	might	use	the same	mount	points.	In	that	case,	the	mount	points	would conflict,	and	you’d	be	able	to	access	only	a	subset	of	the required	data.   The	third	situation	in	which	you	can’t	use	--volumes- from	occurs	when	you	need	to	change	the	write	permission	of a	volume.	This	is	because	--volumes-from	copies	the	full volume	definition.	For	example,	if	your	source	has	a	volume mounted	with	read write	access,	and	you	want	to	share	that with	a	container	that	should	have	only	read	access,	using	-- volumes-from	won’t	work.  Sharing	volumes	with	the	--volumes-from	flag	is	an important	tool	for	building	portable	application	architectures, but	it	does	introduce	some	limitations.	The	more	challenging of	these	are	in	managing	file	permissions.  Using	volumes	decouples	containers	from	the	data	and filesystem	structure	of	the	host	machine,	and	that’s	critical	for most	production	environments.	The	files	and	directories	that Docker	creates	for	managed	volumes	still	need	to	be accounted	for	and	maintained.	The	next	section	shows	you how	to	keep	a	Docker	environment	clean.   4.6.	CLEANING	UP	VOLUMES  By	this	point	in	the	chapter,	you	should	have	quite	a	few containers	and	volumes	to	clean	up.	You	can	see	all	of	the volumes	present	on	your	system	by	running	the	docker volume	list	subcommand.	The	output	will	list	the	type and	name	of	each	volume.	Any	volumes	that	were	created	with a	name	will	be	listed	with	that	name.	Any	anonymous	volumes will	be	listed	by	their	identifier.  Anonymous	volumes	can	be	cleaned	up	in	two	ways.	First, anonymous	volumes	are	automatically	deleted	when	the container	they	were	created	for	are	automatically	cleaned	up. This	happens	when	containers	are	deleted	via	the	docker run	--rm	or	docker	rm	-v	flags.	Second,	they	can	be manually	deleted	by	issuing	a	docker	volume	remove command:  docker	volume	create	--driver=local 	Outputs:  462d0bb7970e47512cd5ebbbb283ed53d5f674b9069b013019ff18ccee37d75d 	 	 docker	volume	remove	\ 				 462d0bb7970e47512cd5ebbbb283ed53d5f674b9069b013019ff18ccee37d75d 	 	Outputs:  462d0bb7970e47512cd5ebbbb283ed53d5f674b9069b013019ff18ccee37d75d  Unlike	anonymous	volumes,	named	volumes	must	always	be deleted	manually.	This	behavior	can	be	helpful	when   containers	are	running	jobs	that	collect	partitioned	or	periodic data.	Consider	the	following:  for	i	in	amazon	google	microsoft;	\ do	\ docker	run	--rm	\ 				--mount	type=volume,src=$i,dst= tmp	\ 	 				--entrypoint	 bin sh	\ 				alpine:latest	-c	"nslookup	$i.com	>	 tmp results.txt";	\ done  This	command	performs	a	DNS	lookup	on	amazon.com, google.com,	and	microsoft.com	in	three	separate	containers and	records	the	results	in	three	different	volumes.	Those volumes	are	named	amazon,	google,	and	microsoft. Even	though	the	containers	are	being	cleaned	up automatically,	the	named	volumes	will	remain.	If	you	run	the command,	you	should	be	able	to	see	the	new	volumes	when you	run	docker	volume	list.  The	only	way	to	delete	these	named	volumes	is	by	specifying their	name	in	the	docker	volume	remove	command:  docker	volume	remove	\ 				amazon	google	microsoft  The	remove	subcommand	supports	a	list	argument	for specifying	volume	names	and	identifiers.	The	preceding command	will	delete	all	three	named	volumes.  There	is	only	one	constraint	for	deleting	volumes:	no	volume that	is	currently	in	use	can	be	deleted.	More	specifically,	no volume	attached	to	any	container	in	any	state	can	be	deleted.	If   you	attempt	to	do	so,	the	Docker	command	will	respond	with	a message	stating,	volume	is	in	use	and	display	the identifier	of	the	container	using	the	volume.  It	can	be	annoying	to	determine	which	volumes	are	candidates for	removal	if	you	simply	want	to	remove	all	or	some	of	the volumes	that	can	be	removed.	This	happens	all	the	time	as	part of	periodic	maintenance.	The	docker	volume	prune command	is	built	for	this	case.  Running	docker	volume	prune	with	no	options	will prompt	you	for	confirmation	and	delete	all	volumes	that	can be	deleted.	You	can	filter	that	candidate	set	by	providing volume	labels:  docker	volume	prune	--filter	example=cassandra  This	command	would	prompt	for	confirmation	and	delete	the volume	you	created	earlier	in	the	Cassandra	example.	If	you’re automating	these	cleanup	procedures,	you	might	want	to suppress	the	confirmation	step.	In	that	case,	use	the	--force or	-f	flag:  docker	volume	prune	--filter	example=location	--force  Understanding	volumes	is	critical	for	working	with	real-world containers,	but	in	many	cases	using	volumes	on	local	disks	can create	problems.	If	you’re	running	software	on	a	cluster	of machines,	the	data	that	software	stores	in	volumes	will	stay	on the	disk	where	it	was	written.	If	a	container	is	moved	to	a different	machine,	it	will	lose	access	to	its	data	in	an	old   volume.	You	can	solve	this	problem	for	your	organization with	volume	plugins.   4.7.	ADVANCED	STORAGE	WITH	VOLUME	PLUGINS  Docker	provides	a	volume	plugin	interface	as	a	means	for	the community	to	extend	the	default	engine	capabilities.	That	has been	implemented	by	several	storage	management	tools,	and today	users	are	free	to	use	all	types	of	backing	storage including	proprietary	cloud	block	storage,	network	filesystem mounts,	specialized	storage	hardware,	and	on-premises	cloud solutions	such	as	Ceph	and	vSphere	storage.  These	community	and	vendor	plugins	will	help	you	solve	the hard	problems	associated	with	writing	files	to	disk	on	one machine	and	depending	on	them	from	another.	They	are simple	to	install,	configure,	and	remove	using	the	appropriate docker	plugin	subcommands.  Docker	plugins	are	not	covered	in	detail	in	this	text.	They	are always	environment	specific	and	difficult	to	demonstrate without	using	paid	resources	or	endorsing	specific	cloud providers.	Choosing	a	plugin	depends	on	the	storage infrastructure	you	want	to	integrate	with,	although	a	few projects	simplify	this	to	some	degree.	REX-Ray  https:  github.com rexray rexray 	is	a	popular	open	source project	that	provides	volumes	on	several	cloud	and	on- premises	storage	platforms.	If	you’ve	come	to	the	point	in your	container	journey	that	you	need	more	sophisticated volume	backends,	you	should	look	at	the	latest	offerings	on Docker	Hub	and	look	into	the	current	status	of	REX-Ray.   SUMMARY  One	of	the	first	major	hurdles	in	learning	how	to	use	Docker	is understanding	how	to	work	with	files	that	are	not	part	of images	and	might	be	shared	with	other	containers	or	the	host. This	chapter	covers	mount	points	in	depth,	including	the following:  Mount	points	allow	many	filesystems	from	many	devices	to	be	attached	to a	single	file	tree.	Every	container	has	its	own	file	tree.  Containers	can	use	bind	mounts	to	attach	parts	of	the	host	filesystem	into	a container.  In-memory	filesystems	can	be	attached	to	a	container	file	tree	so	that sensitive	or	temporary	data	is	not	written	to	disk.  Docker	provides	anonymous	or	named	storage	references	called	volumes.  Volumes	can	be	created,	listed,	and	deleted	using	the	appropriate	docker volume	subcommand.  Volumes	are	parts	of	the	host	filesystem	that	Docker	mounts	into containers	at	specified	locations.  Volumes	have	life	cycles	of	their	own	and	might	need	to	be	periodically cleaned	up.  Docker	can	provide	volumes	backed	by	network	storage	or	other	more sophisticated	tools	if	the	appropriate	volume	plugin	is	installed.   Chapter	5.	Single-host	networking  This	chapter	covers  Networking	background  Creating	Docker	container	networks  Network-less	and	host-mode	containers  Publishing	services	on	the	ingress	network  Container	network	caveats  Networking	is	a	whole	field	of	computing,	and	so	this	chapter can	only	scratch	the	surface	by	covering	specific	challenges, structures,	and	tools	required	for	container	networks.	If	you want	to	run	a	website,	database,	email	server,	or	any	software that	depends	on	networking,	such	as	a	web	browser	inside	a Docker	container,	you	need	to	understand	how	to	connect	that container	to	the	network.	After	reading	this	chapter,	you’ll	be able	to	create	containers	with	network	exposure	appropriate for	the	application	you’re	running,	use	network	software	in one	container	from	another,	and	understand	how	containers interact	with	the	host	and	the	host’s	network.   5.1.	NETWORKING	BACKGROUND	 FOR	BEGINNERS   A	quick	overview	of	relevant	networking	concepts	will	be helpful	for	understanding	the	topics	in	this	chapter.	This section	includes	only	high-level	detail;	if	you’re	an	expert,	feel free	to	skip	ahead.  Networking	is	all	about	communicating	between	processes	that may	or	may	not	share	the	same	local	resources.	To	understand the	material	in	this	chapter,	you	need	to	consider	only	a	few basic	network	abstractions	that	are	commonly	used	by processes.	The	better	understanding	you	have	of	networking, the	more	you’ll	learn	about	the	mechanics	at	work.	But	a	deep understanding	isn’t	required	to	use	the	tools	provided	by Docker.	If	anything,	the	material	contained	herein	should prompt	you	to	independently	research	selected	topics	as	they come	up.	Those	basic	abstractions	used	by	processes	include protocols,	network	interfaces,	and	ports.  5.1.1.	Basics:	Protocols,	interfaces,	and	ports  A	protocol	with	respect	to	communication	and	networking	is	a sort	of	language.	Two	parties	that	agree	on	a	protocol	can understand	what	the	other	is	communicating.	This	is	key	to effective	communication.	Hypertext	Transfer	Protocol	 HTTP  is	one	popular	network	protocol	that	many	people	have	heard of.	It’s	the	protocol	that	provides	the	World	Wide	Web.	A huge	number	of	network	protocols	and	several	layers	of communication	are	created	by	those	protocols.	For	now,	it’s   only	important	that	you	know	what	a	protocol	is	so	that	you can	understand	network	interfaces	and	ports.  A	network	interface	has	an	address	and	represents	a	location. You	can	think	of	interfaces	as	analogous	to	real-world locations	with	addresses.	A	network	interface	is	like	a mailbox.	Messages	are	delivered	to	a	mailbox	for	recipients	at that	address,	and	messages	are	taken	from	a	mailbox	to	be delivered	elsewhere.  Whereas	a	mailbox	has	a	postal	address,	a	network	interface has	an	IP	address,	which	is	defined	by	the	Internet	Protocol. The	details	of	IP	are	interesting	but	outside	of	the	scope	of	this book.	The	important	thing	to	know	about	IP	addresses	is	that they	are	unique	in	their	network	and	contain	information	about their	location	on	their	network.  It’s	common	for	computers	to	have	two	kinds	of	interfaces:	an Ethernet	interface	and	a	loopback	interface.	An	Ethernet interface	is	what	you’re	likely	most	familiar	with.	It’s	used	to connect	to	other	interfaces	and	processes.	A	loopback interface	isn’t	connected	to	any	other	interface.	At	first	this might	seem	useless,	but	it’s	often	useful	to	be	able	to	use network	protocols	to	communicate	with	other	programs	on	the same	computer.	In	those	cases,	a	loopback	is	a	great	solution.  In	keeping	with	the	mailbox	metaphor,	a	port	is	like	a recipient	or	a	sender.	Several	people	might	receive	messages at	a	single	address.	For	example,	a	single	address	might receive	messages	for	Wendy	Webserver,	Deborah	Database, and	Casey	Cache,	as	illustrated	in	figure	5.1.	Each	recipient   should	open	only	their	own	messages.  Figure	5.1.	Processes	use	the	same	interface	and	are	uniquely	identified	in	the	same	way	that multiple	people	might	use	the	same	mailbox.  In	reality,	ports	are	just	numbers	and	defined	as	part	of	the Transmission	Control	Protocol	 TCP 	or	User	Datagram Protocol	 UDP .	Again,	the	details	of	the	protocol	are	beyond the	scope	of	this	book,	but	we	encourage	you	to	read	about	it sometime.	People	who	created	standards	for	protocols,	or companies	that	own	a	particular	product,	decide	which	port number	should	be	used	for	specific	purposes.	For	example, web	servers	provide	HTTP	on	port	80	by	default.	MySQL,	a database	product,	serves	its	protocol	on	port	3306	by	default. Memcached,	a	fast	cache	technology,	provides	its	protocol	on port	11211.	Ports	are	written	on	TCP	messages	just	as	names are	written	on	envelopes.  Interfaces,	protocols,	and	ports	are	all	immediate	concerns	for software	and	users.	By	learning	about	these	things,	you develop	a	better	appreciation	for	the	way	programs communicate	as	well	as	the	way	your	computer	fits	into	the bigger	picture.   5.1.2.	Bigger	picture:	Networks,	NAT,	and	port forwarding  Interfaces	are	single	points	in	larger	networks.	Networks	are defined	in	the	way	that	interfaces	are	linked	together,	and	that linkage	determines	an	interface’s	IP	address.  Sometimes	a	message	has	a	recipient	that	an	interface	is	not directly	linked	to,	so	instead	it’s	delivered	to	an	intermediary that	knows	how	to	route	the	message	for	delivery.	Coming back	to	the	mail	metaphor,	this	is	similar	to	the	way	real-world mail	carriers	operate.  When	you	place	a	message	in	your	outbox,	a	mail	carrier	picks it	up	and	delivers	it	to	a	local	routing	facility.	That	facility	is itself	an	interface.	It	will	take	the	message	and	send	it	along	to the	next	stop	on	the	route	to	a	destination.	A	local	routing facility	for	a	mail	carrier	might	forward	a	message	to	a regional	facility,	and	then	to	a	local	facility	for	the	destination, and	finally	to	the	recipient.	It’s	common	for	network	routes	to follow	a	similar	pattern.	Figure	5.2	illustrates	the	described route	and	draws	the	relationships	between	physical	message routing	and	network	routing.  Figure	5.2.	The	path	of	a	message	in	a	postal	system	and	a	computer	network   This	chapter	is	concerned	with	interfaces	that	exist	on	a	single computer,	so	the	networks	and	routes	we	consider	won’t	be anywhere	near	that	complicated.	In	fact,	this	chapter	is	about two	specific	networks	and	the	way	containers	are	attached	to them.	The	first	network	is	the	one	that	your	computer	is connected	to.	The	second	is	a	virtual	network	that	Docker creates	to	connect	all	of	the	running	containers	to	the	network that	the	computer	is	connected	to.	That	second	network	is called	a	bridge.  A	bridge	is	an	interface	that	connects	multiple	networks	so that	they	can	function	as	a	single	network,	as	shown	in	figure 5.3.	Bridges	work	by	selectively	forwarding	traffic	between the	connected	networks	based	on	another	type	of	network address.	To	understand	the	material	in	this	chapter,	you	need to	be	comfortable	with	only	this	abstract	idea.  Figure	5.3.	A	bridge	interface	connecting	two	distinct	networks   This	has	been	a	very	rough	introduction	to	some	nuanced topics.	The	explanation	only	scratched	the	surface	in	order	to help	you	understand	how	to	use	Docker	and	the	networking facilities	that	it	simplifies.   5.2.	DOCKER	CONTAINER	NETWORKING  Docker	abstracts	the	underlying	host-attached	network	from containers.	Doing	so	provides	a	degree	of	runtime environment	agnosticism	for	the	application,	and	allows infrastructure	managers	to	adapt	the	implementation	to	suit	the operating	environment.	A	container	attached	to	a	Docker network	will	get	a	unique	IP	address	that	is	routable	from other	containers	attached	to	the	same	Docker	network.  The	main	problem	with	this	approach	is	that	there	is	no	easy way	for	any	software	running	inside	a	container	to	determine the	IP	address	of	the	host	where	the	container	is	running.	This inhibits	a	container	from	advertising	its	service	endpoint	to other	services	outside	the	container	network.	Section	5.5 covers	a	few	methods	for	dealing	with	this	edge	case.  Docker	also	treats	networks	as	first-class	entities.	This	means that	they	have	their	own	life	cycle	and	are	not	bound	to	any other	objects.	You	can	define	and	manage	them	directly	by using	the	docker	network	subcommands.  To	get	started	with	networks	in	Docker,	examine	the	default networks	that	are	available	with	every	Docker	installation. Running	docker	network	ls	will	print	a	table	of	all	the networks	to	the	terminal.	The	resulting	table	should	look	like this:  NETWORK	ID										NAME																DRIVER SCOPE 63d93214524b								bridge														bridge   63d93214524b								bridge														bridge local 6eeb489baff0								host																host local 3254d02034ed								none																null local  By	default,	Docker	includes	three	networks,	and	each	is provided	by	a	different	driver.	The	network	named	bridge	is the	default	network	and	provided	by	a	bridge	driver.	The bridge	driver	provides	intercontainer	connectivity	for	all containers	running	on	the	same	machine.	The	host	network is	provided	by	the	host	driver,	which	instructs	Docker	not	to create	any	special	networking	namespace	or	resources	for attached	containers.	Containers	on	the	host	network	interact with	the	host’s	network	stack	like	uncontained	processes. Finally,	the	none	network	uses	the	null	driver.	Containers attached	to	the	none	network	will	not	have	any	network connectivity	outside	themselves.  The	scope	of	a	network	can	take	three	values:	local, global,	or	swarm.	This	indicates	whether	the	network	is constrained	to	the	machine	where	the	network	exists	 local , should	be	created	on	every	node	in	a	cluster	but	not	route between	them	 global ,	or	seamlessly	spans	all	of	the	hosts participating	in	a	Docker	swarm	 multihost	or	cluster-wide . As	you	can	see,	all	of	the	default	networks	have	the	local scope,	and	will	not	be	able	to	directly	route	traffic	between containers	running	on	different	machines.  The	default	bridge	network	maintains	compatibility	with legacy	Docker	and	cannot	take	advantage	of	modern	Docker features	including	service	discovery	or	load	balancing.	Using   it	is	not	recommended.	So	the	first	thing	you	should	do	is create	your	own	bridge	network.  5.2.1.	Creating	a	user-defined	bridge	network  The	Docker	bridge	network	driver	uses	Linux	namespaces, virtual	Ethernet	devices,	and	the	Linux	firewall	to	build	a specific	and	customizable	virtual	network	topology	called	a bridge.	The	resulting	virtual	network	is	local	to	the	machine where	Docker	is	installed	and	creates	routes	between participating	containers	and	the	wider	network	where	the	host is	attached.	Figure	5.4	illustrates	two	containers	attached	to	a bridge	network	and	its	components.  Figure	5.4.	The	default	local	Docker	network	topology	and	two	attached	containers   Containers	have	their	own	private	loopback	interface	and	a separate	virtual	Ethernet	interface	linked	to	another	virtual interface	in	the	host’s	namespace.	These	two	linked	interfaces form	a	link	between	the	host’s	network	and	the	container.	Just like	typical	home	networks,	each	container	is	assigned	a unique	private	IP	address	that’s	not	directly	reachable	from	the external	network.	Connections	are	routed	through	another Docker	network	that	routes	traffic	between	containers	and	may connect	to	the	host’s	network	to	form	a	bridge.  Build	a	new	network	with	a	single	command:  docker	network	create	\ 		--driver	bridge	\ 		--label	project=dockerinaction	\ 		--label	chapter=5	\ 		--attachable	\ 		--scope	local	\ 		--subnet	10.0.42.0 24	\ 		--ip-range	10.0.42.128 25	\ 		user-network  This	command	creates	a	new	local	bridge	network	named user-network.	Adding	label	metadata	to	the	network	will help	in	identifying	the	resource	later.	Marking	the	new network	as	attachable	allows	you	to	attach	and	detach containers	to	the	network	at	any	time.	Here	you’ve	manually specified	the	network	scope	property	and	set	it	to	the	default value	for	this	driver.	Finally,	a	custom	subnet	and	assignable address	range	was	defined	for	this	network,	10.0.42.0 24, assigning	from	the	upper	half	of	the	last	octet  10.0.42.128 25 .	This	means	that	as	you	add	containers	to	this network,	they	will	receive	IP	addresses	in	the	range	from 10.0.42.128	to	10.0.42.255.   You	can	inspect	networks	like	other	first-class	Docker	entities. The	next	section	demonstrates	how	to	use	containers	with	user networks	and	inspect	the	resulting	network	configuration.  5.2.2.	Exploring	a	bridge	network  If	you’re	going	to	run	network	software	inside	a	container	on	a container	network,	you	should	have	a	solid	understanding	of what	that	network	looks	like	from	within	a	container.	Start exploring	your	new	bridge	network	by	creating	a	new container	attached	to	that	network:  docker	run	-it	\ 		--network	user-network	\ 		--name	network-explorer	\ 		alpine:3.8	\ 				sh  Get	a	list	of	the	IPv4	addresses	available	in	the	container	from your	terminal	 which	is	now	attached	to	the	running	container  by	running	the	following:  ip	-f	inet	-4	-o	addr  The	results	should	look	something	like	this:  1:	lo				inet	127.0.0.1 8	scope	host	lo\	... 18:	eth0				inet	10.0.42.129 24	brd	10.0.42.255	scope	global eth0\	...  You	can	see	from	this	list	that	the	container	has	two	network devices	with	IPv4	addresses.	Those	are	the	loopback	interface  or	localhost 	and	eth0	 a	virtual	Ethernet	device ,	which	is   connected	to	the	bridge	network.	Further,	you	can	see	that	eth0 has	an	IP	address	within	the	range	and	subnet	specified	by	the user-network	configuration	 the	range	from	10.0.42.128	to 10.0.42.255 .	That	IP	address	is	the	one	that	any	other container	on	this	bridge	network	would	use	to	communicate with	services	you	run	in	this	container.	The	loopback	interface can	be	used	only	for	communication	within	the	same container.  Next,	create	another	bridge	network	and	attach	your	running network-explorer	container	to	both	networks.	First, detach	your	terminal	from	the	running	container	 press	Ctrl-P and	then	Ctrl-Q 	and	then	create	the	second	bridge	network:  docker	network	create	\ 		--driver	bridge	\ 		--label	project=dockerinaction	\ 		--label	chapter=5	\ 	 		--attachable	\ 		--scope	local	\ 		--subnet	10.0.43.0 24	\ 		--ip-range	10.0.43.128 25	\ 		user-network2  docker	network	connect	\ 		user-network2	\											1 		network-explorer										2  1	Network	name	 or	ID   2	Target	container	name	 or	ID   Once	the	second	network	has	been	created,	you	can	attach	the network-explorer	container	 still	running :  After	the	container	has	been	attached	to	the	second	network,   reattach	your	terminal	to	continue	your	exploration:  docker	attach	network-explorer  Now,	back	in	the	container,	examining	the	network	interface configuration	again	will	show	something	like	this:  1:	lo				inet	127.0.0.1 8	scope	host	lo\	... 18:	eth0				inet	10.0.42.129 24	brd	10.0.42.255	scope	global eth0\	... 20:	eth1				inet	10.0.43.129 24	brd	10.0.43.255	scope	global eth1\	...  As	you	might	expect,	this	output	shows	that	the	network- explorer	container	is	attached	to	both	user-defined	bridge networks.  Networking	is	all	about	communication	between	multiple parties,	and	examining	a	network	with	only	one	running container	can	be	a	bit	boring.	But	is	there	anything	else attached	to	a	bridge	network	by	default?	Another	tool	is needed	to	continue	exploring.	Install	the	nmap	package	inside your	running	container	by	using	this	command:  apk	update	&&	apk	add	nmap  Nmap	is	a	powerful	network	inspection	tool	that	can	be	used to	scan	network	address	ranges	for	running	machines, fingerprint	those	machines,	and	determine	what	services	they are	running.	For	our	purposes,	we	simply	want	to	determine what	other	containers	or	other	network	devices	are	available on	our	bridge	network.	Run	the	following	command	to	scan   the	10.0.42.0 24	subnet	that	we	defined	for	our	bridge network:  nmap	-sn	10.0.42.*	-sn	10.0.43.*	-oG	 dev stdout		grep	Status  The	command	should	output	something	like	this:  Host:	10.0.42.128	  							Status:	Up Host:	10.0.42.129	 7c2c161261cb 			Status:	Up 	 Host:	10.0.43.128	  							Status:	Up Host:	10.0.43.129	 7c2c161261cb 			Status:	Up  This	shows	that	only	two	devices	are	attached	to	each	of	the bridge	networks:	the	gateway	adapters	created	by	the	bridge network	driver	and	the	currently	running	container.	Create another	container	on	one	of	the	two	bridge	networks	for	more interesting	results.  Detach	from	the	terminal	again	 Ctrl-P,	Ctrl-Q 	and	start another	container	attached	to	user-network2.	Run	the following:  docker	run	-d	\ 		--name	lighthouse	\ 		--network	user-network2	\ 		alpine:3.8	\ 				sleep	1d  After	the	lighthouse	container	has	started,	reattach	to	your network-explorer	container:  docker	attach	network-explorer   And	from	the	shell	in	that	container,	run	the	network	scan again.	The	results	show	that	the	lighthouse	container	is	up and	running,	and	accessible	from	the	network-explorer container	via	its	attachment	to	user-network2.	The	output should	be	similar	to	this:  Host:	10.0.42.128	  							Status:	Up Host:	10.0.42.129	 7c2c161261cb 			Status:	Up Host:	10.0.43.128	  							Status:	Up Host:	10.0.43.130	 lighthouse.user-network2 							Status:	Up Host:	10.0.43.129	 7c2c161261cb 				Status:	Up  Discovering	the	lighthouse	container	on	the	network confirms	that	the	network	attachment	works	as	expected,	and demonstrates	how	the	DNS-based	service	discovery	system works.	When	you	scanned	the	network,	you	discovered	the new	node	by	its	IP	address,	and	nmap	was	able	to	resolve	that IP	address	to	a	name.	This	means	that	you	 or	your	code 	can discover	individual	containers	on	the	network	based	on	their name.	Try	this	yourself	by	running	nslookup lighthouse	inside	the	container.	Container	hostnames	are based	on	the	container	name,	or	can	be	set	manually	at container	creation	time	by	specifying	the	--hostname	flag.  This	exploration	has	demonstrated	your	ability	to	shape	bridge networks	to	fit	your	environment,	the	ability	to	attach	a running	container	to	more	than	one	network,	and	what	those networks	look	like	to	running	software	inside	an	attached container.	But	bridge	networks	work	on	only	a	single	machine. They	are	not	cluster-aware,	and	the	container	IP	addresses	are not	routable	from	outside	that	machine.   5.2.3.	Beyond	bridge	networks  Depending	on	your	use	case,	bridge	networks	might	be enough.	For	example,	bridge	networks	are	typically	great	for single-server	deployments	such	as	a	LAMP	stack	running	a content	management	system,	or	most	local	development	tasks. But	if	you	are	running	a	multiserver	environment	that	is designed	to	tolerate	machine	failure,	you	need	to	be	able	to seamlessly	route	traffic	between	containers	on	different machines.	Bridge	networks	will	not	do	this.  Docker	has	a	few	options	to	handle	this	use	case	out	of	the box.	The	best	option	depends	on	the	environment	where	you are	building	the	network.	If	you	are	using	Docker	on	Linux hosts	and	have	control	of	the	host	network,	you	can	use underlay	networks	provided	by	the	macvlan	or	ipvlan network	drivers.	Underlay	networks	create	first-class	network addresses	for	each	container.	Those	identities	are	discoverable and	routable	from	the	same	network	where	the	host	is attached.	Each	container	running	on	a	machine	just	looks	like an	independent	node	on	the	network.  If	you	are	running	Docker	for	Mac	or	Docker	for	Windows	or are	running	in	a	managed	cloud	environment,	those	options will	not	work.	Further,	underlay	network	configuration	is dependent	on	the	host	network,	and	so	definitions	are	rarely portable.	The	more	popular	multihost	container	network option	is	overlay	networks.  The	overlay	network	driver	is	available	on	Docker	engines where	swarm	mode	is	enabled.	Overlay	networks	are	similar   in	construction	to	bridge	networks,	but	the	logical	bridge component	is	multihost-aware	and	can	route	intercontainer connections	between	every	node	in	a	swarm.  Just	like	on	a	bridge	network,	containers	on	an	overlay network	are	not	directly	routable	from	outside	the	cluster.	But intercontainer	communication	is	simple,	and	network definitions	are	mostly	independent	of	the	host	network environment.  In	some	cases,	you’ll	have	special	network	requirements	that aren’t	covered	by	underlay	or	overlay	networks.	Maybe	you need	to	be	able	to	tune	the	host	network	configuration	or	to make	sure	that	a	container	operates	with	total	network isolation.	In	those	cases,	you	should	use	one	of	the	special container	networks.   5.3.	SPECIAL	CONTAINER	NETWORKS:	HOST	AND NONE  When	you	list	the	available	networks	with	docker network	list,	the	results	will	include	two	special	entries: host	and	none.	These	are	not	really	networks;	instead,	they are	network	attachment	types	with	special	meaning.  When	you	specify	the	--network	host	option	on	a docker	run	command,	you	are	telling	Docker	to	create	a new	container	without	any	special	network	adapters	or network	namespace.	Whatever	software	is	running	inside	the resulting	container	will	have	the	same	degree	of	access	to	the host	network	as	it	would	running	outside	the	container.	Since there	is	no	network	namespace,	all	of	the	kernel	tools	for tuning	the	network	stack	are	available	for	modification	 as long	as	the	modifying	process	has	access	to	do	so .  Containers	running	on	the	host	network	are	able	to	access	host services	running	on	localhost	and	are	able	to	see	and	bind	to any	of	the	host	network	interfaces.	The	following	command demonstrates	this	by	listing	all	of	the	available	network interfaces	from	inside	a	container	on	the	host	network:  docker	run	--rm	\ 				--network	host	\ 				alpine:3.8	ip	-o	addr  Running	on	the	host	network	is	useful	for	system	services	or other	infrastructure	components.	But	it	is	not	appropriate	in   multitenant	environments	and	should	be	disallowed	for	third- party	containers.	Along	these	lines,	you’ll	often	want	to	not attach	a	container	to	a	network.	In	the	spirit	of	building systems	of	least	privilege,	you	should	use	the	none	network whenever	possible.  Creating	a	container	on	the	none	network	instructs	Docker not	to	provision	any	connected	virtual	Ethernet	adapters	for the	new	container.	It	will	have	its	own	network	namespace	and so	it	will	be	isolated,	but	without	adapters	connected	across	the namespace	boundary,	it	will	not	be	able	to	use	the	network	to communicate	outside	the	container.	Containers	configured	this way	will	still	have	their	own	loopback	interface,	and	so multiprocess	containers	can	still	use	connections	to	localhost for	interprocess	communication.  You	can	verify	this	by	inspecting	the	network	configuration yourself.	Run	the	following	command	to	list	the	available interfaces	inside	a	container	on	the	none	network:  docker	run	--rm	\ 				--network	none	\ 				alpine:3.8	ip	-o	addr  Running	this	example,	you	can	see	that	the	only	network interface	available	is	the	loopback	interface,	bound	to	the address	127.0.0.1.	This	configuration	means	three	things:  Any	program	running	in	the	container	can	connect	to	or	wait	for connections	on	that	interface.  Nothing	outside	the	container	can	connect	to	that	interface.  No	program	running	inside	that	container	can	reach	anything	outside	the   container.  That	last	point	is	important	and	easily	demonstrated.	If	you’re connected	to	the	internet,	try	to	reach	a	popular	service	that should	always	be	available.	In	this	case,	try	to	reach Cloudflare’s	public	DNS	service:  docker	run	--rm	\ 				--network	none	\							1 				alpine:3.8	\ 				ping	-w	2	1.1.1.1						2  1	Creates	a	closed	container  2	Pings	Cloudflare  In	this	example,	you	create	a	network-isolated	container	and try	to	test	the	speed	between	your	container	and	the	public DNS	server	provided	by	Cloudflare.	This	attempt	should	fail with	a	message	like	ping:	send-to:	Network	is unreachable.	This	makes	sense	because	we	know	that	the container	has	no	route	to	the	larger	network.  When	to	use	closed	containers  The	none	network	should	be	used	when	the	need	for	network isolation	is	the	highest	or	whenever	a	program	doesn’t	require network	access.	For	example,	running	a	terminal	text	editor shouldn’t	require	network	access.	Running	a	program	to generate	a	random	password	should	be	run	inside	a	container without	network	access	to	prevent	the	theft	of	that	secret.   Containers	on	the	none	network	are	isolated	from	each	other and	the	rest	of	the	world,	but	remember	that	even	containers on	the	bridge	network	are	not	directly	routable	from	outside the	host	running	the	Docker	engine.  Bridge	networks	use	network	address	translation	 NAT 	to make	all	outbound	container	traffic	with	destinations	outside the	bridge	network	look	like	it	is	coming	from	the	host	itself. This	means	that	the	service	software	you	have	running	in containers	is	isolated	from	the	rest	of	the	world,	and	the	parts of	the	network	where	most	of	your	clients	and	customers	are located.	The	next	section	describes	how	to	bridge	that	gap.   5.4.	HANDLING	INBOUND	TRAFFIC	WITH	NODEPORT PUBLISHING  Docker	container	networks	are	all	about	simple	connectivity and	routing	between	containers.	Connecting	services	running in	those	containers	with	external	network	clients	requires	an extra	step.	Since	container	networks	are	connected	to	the broader	network	via	network	address	translation,	you	have	to specifically	tell	Docker	how	to	forward	traffic	from	the external	network	interfaces.	You	need	to	specify	a	TCP	or UDP	port	on	the	host	interface	and	a	target	container	and container	port,	similar	to	forwarding	traffic	through	a	NAT barrier	on	your	home	network.  NodePort	publishing	is	a	term	we’ve	used	here	to	match Docker	and	other	ecosystem	projects.	The	Node	portion	is	an inference	to	the	host	as	typically	a	node	in	a	larger	cluster	of machines.  Port	publication	configuration	is	provided	at	container	creation time	and	cannot	be	changed	later.	The	docker	run	and docker	create	commands	provide	a	-p	or	--publish list	option.	Like	other	options,	the	-p	option	takes	a	colon- delimited	string	argument.	That	argument	specifies	the	host interface,	the	port	on	the	host	to	forward,	the	target	port,	and the	port	protocol.	All	of	the	following	arguments	are equivalent:  0.0.0.0:8080:8080 tcp   8080:8080 tcp  8080:8080  Each	of	those	options	will	forward	TCP	port	8080	from	all host	interfaces	to	TCP	port	8080	in	the	new	container.	The first	argument	is	the	full	form.	To	put	the	syntax	in	a	more complete	context,	consider	the	following	example	commands:  docker	run	--rm	\ 		-p	8080	\ 		alpine:3.8	echo	"forward	ephemeral	TCP	->	container	TCP	8080" 	 docker	run	--rm	\ 		-p	8088:8080 udp	\ 		alpine:3.8	echo	"host	UDP	8088	->	container	UDP	8080" 	 docker	run	--rm	\ 		-p	127.0.0.1:8080:8080 tcp	\ 		-p	127.0.0.1:3000:3000 tcp	\ 		alpine:3.8	echo	"forward	multiple	TCP	ports	from	localhost"  These	commands	all	do	different	things	and	demonstrate	the flexibility	of	the	syntax.	The	first	problem	that	new	users encounter	is	in	presuming	that	the	first	example	will	map	8080 on	the	host	to	port	8080	in	the	container.	What	actually happens	is	the	host	operating	system	will	select	a	random	host port,	and	traffic	will	be	routed	to	port	8080	in	the	container. The	benefit	to	this	design	and	default	behavior	is	that	ports	are scarce	resources,	and	choosing	a	random	port	allows	the software	and	the	tooling	to	avoid	potential	conflicts.	But programs	running	inside	a	container	have	no	way	of	knowing that	they	are	running	inside	a	container,	that	they	are	bound	to a	container	network,	or	which	port	is	being	forwarded	from	the host.   Docker	provides	a	mechanism	for	looking	up	port	mappings. That	feature	is	critical	when	you	let	the	operating	system choose	a	port.	Run	the	docker	port	subcommand	to	see the	ports	forwarded	to	any	given	container:  docker	run	-d	-p	8080	--name	listener	alpine:3.8	sleep	300 docker	port	listener  This	information	is	also	available	in	summary	form	with	the docker	ps	subcommand,	but	picking	specific	mappings	out of	the	table	can	be	tiresome	and	does	not	compose	well	with other	commands.	The	docker	port	subcommand	also allows	you	to	narrow	the	lookup	query	by	specifying	the container	port	and	protocol.	That	is	particularly	useful	when multiple	ports	are	published:  docker	run	-d	\ 		-p	8080	\																									1 		-p	3000	\																									1 		-p	7500	\																									1 		--name	multi-listener	\ 		alpine:3.8	sleep	300  docker	port	multi-listener	3000					2  1	Publishes	multiple	ports  2	Looks	up	the	host	port	mapped	to	container	port	3000  With	the	tools	covered	in	this	section,	you	should	be	able	to manage	routing	any	inbound	traffic	to	the	correct	container running	on	your	host.	But	there	are	several	other	ways	to customize	container	network	configurations	and	caveats	in working	with	Docker	networks.	Those	are	covered	in	the	next section.   5.5.	CONTAINER	NETWORKING	CAVEATS	AND CUSTOMIZATIONS  Networking	is	used	by	all	kinds	of	applications	and	in	many contexts.	Some	bring	requirements	that	cannot	be	fulfilled today,	or	might	require	further	network	customization.	This section	covers	a	short	list	of	topics	that	any	user	should	be familiar	with	in	adopting	containers	for	networked applications.  5.5.1.	No	firewalls	or	network	policies  Today	Docker	container	networks	do	not	provide	any	access control	or	firewall	mechanisms	between	containers.	Docker networking	was	designed	to	follow	the	namespace	model	that is	in	use	in	so	many	other	places	in	Docker.	The	namespace model	solves	resource	access-control	problems	by transforming	them	into	addressability	problems.	The	thinking is	that	software	that’s	in	two	containers	in	the	same	container network	should	be	able	to	communicate.	In	practice,	this	is	far from	the	truth,	and	nothing	short	of	application-level authentication	and	authorization	can	protect	containers	from each	other	on	the	same	network.	Remember,	different applications	carry	different	vulnerabilities	and	might	be running	in	containers	on	different	hosts	with	different	security postures.	A	compromised	application	does	not	need	to	escalate privileges	before	it	opens	network	connections.	The	firewall will	not	protect	you.   This	design	decision	impacts	the	way	we	have	to	architect internetwork	service	dependencies	and	model	common	service deployments.	In	short,	always	deploy	containers	with appropriate	application-level	access-control	mechanisms because	containers	on	the	same	container	network	will	have mutual	 bidirectional 	unrestricted	network	access.  5.5.2.	Custom	DNS	configuration  Domain	Name	System	 DNS 	is	a	protocol	for	mapping hostnames	to	IP	addresses.	This	mapping	enables	clients	to decouple	from	a	dependency	on	a	specific	host	IP	and	instead depend	on	whatever	host	is	referred	to	by	a	known	name.	One of	the	most	basic	ways	to	change	outbound	communications	is by	creating	names	for	IP	addresses.  Typically,	containers	on	the	bridge	network	and	other computers	on	your	network	have	private	IP	addresses	that aren’t	publicly	routable.	This	means	that	unless	you’re	running your	own	DNS	server,	you	can’t	refer	to	them	by	a	name. Docker	provides	different	options	for	customizing	the	DNS configuration	for	a	new	container.  First,	the	docker	run	command	has	a	--hostname	flag that	you	can	use	to	set	the	hostname	of	a	new	container.	This flag	adds	an	entry	to	the	DNS	override	system	inside	the container.	The	entry	maps	the	provided	hostname	to	the container’s	bridge	IP	address:  docker	run	--rm	\ 				--hostname	barker	\					1 				alpine:3.8	\ 				nslookup	barker									2   1	Sets	the	container	hostname  2	Resolves	the	hostname	to	an	IP	address  This	example	creates	a	new	container	with	the	hostname barker	and	runs	a	program	to	look	up	the	IP	address	for	the same	name.	Running	this	example	will	generate	output	that looks	something	like	the	following:  Server:				10.0.2.3 Address	1:	10.0.2.3 	 Name:						barker Address	1:	172.17.0.22	barker  The	IP	address	on	the	last	line	is	the	bridge	IP	address	for	the new	container.	The	IP	address	provided	on	the	line	labeled Server	is	the	address	of	the	server	that	provided	the mapping.  Setting	the	hostname	of	a	container	is	useful	when	programs running	inside	a	container	need	to	look	up	their	own	IP address	or	must	self-identify.	Because	other	containers	don’t know	this	hostname,	its	uses	are	limited.	But	if	you	use	an external	DNS	server,	you	can	share	those	hostnames.  The	second	option	for	customizing	the	DNS	configuration	of	a container	is	the	ability	to	specify	one	or	more	DNS	servers	to use.	To	demonstrate,	the	following	example	creates	a	new container	and	sets	the	DNS	server	for	that	container	to Google’s	public	DNS	service:  docker	run	--rm	\   				--dns	8.8.8.8	\										1 				alpine:3.8	\ 				nslookup	docker.com						2  1	Sets	primary	DNS	server  2	Resolves	IP	address	of	docker.com  Using	a	specific	DNS	server	can	provide	consistency	if	you’re running	Docker	on	a	laptop	and	often	move	between	internet service	providers.	It’s	a	critical	tool	for	people	building services	and	networks.	There	are	a	few	important	notes	on setting	your	own	DNS	server:  The	value	must	be	an	IP	address.	If	you	think	about	it,	the	reason	is obvious:	the	container	needs	a	DNS	server	to	perform	the	lookup	on	a name.  The	--dns=[]	flag	can	be	set	multiple	times	to	set	multiple	DNS	servers  in	case	one	or	more	are	unreachable .  The	--dns=[]	flag	can	be	set	when	you	start	up	the	Docker	engine	that runs	in	the	background.	When	you	do	so,	those	DNS	servers	will	be	set	on every	container	by	default.	But	if	you	stop	the	engine	with	containers running	and	change	the	default	when	you	restart	the	engine,	the	running containers	will	still	have	the	old	DNS	settings.	You’ll	need	to	restart	those containers	for	the	change	to	take	effect.  The	third	DNS-related	option,	--dns-search=[],	allows you	to	specify	a	DNS	search	domain,	which	is	like	a	default hostname	suffix.	With	one	set,	any	hostnames	that	don’t	have a	known	top-level	domain	 for	example,	.com	or	.net 	will	be searched	for	with	the	specified	suffix	appended:  docker	run	--rm	\ 				--dns-search	docker.com	\				1 				alpine:3.8	\ 				nslookup	hub																	2   1	Sets	search	domain  2	Looks	up	shortcut	for	hub.docker.com  This	command	will	resolve	to	the	IP	address	of hub.docker.com	because	the	DNS	search	domain	provided	will complete	the	hostname.	It	works	by	manipulating  etc resolv.conf,	a	file	used	to	configure	common	name- resolution	libraries.	The	following	command	shows	how	these DNS	manipulation	options	impact	the	file:  docker	run	--rm	\ 				--dns-search	docker.com	\											1 				--dns	1.1.1.1	\																					2 				alpine:3.8	cat	 etc resolv.conf 	Will	display	contents	that	look	like: 	search	docker.com 	nameserver	1.1.1.1  1	Sets	search	domain  2	Sets	primary	DNS	server  This	feature	is	most	often	used	for	trivialities	such	as	shortcut names	for	internal	corporate	networks.	For	example,	your company	might	maintain	an	internal	documentation	wiki	that you	can	simply	reference	at	http:  wiki .	But	this	can	be	much more	powerful.  Suppose	you	maintain	a	single	DNS	server	for	your development	and	test	environments.	Rather	than	building environment-aware	software	 with	hardcoded	environment- specific	names	such	as	myservice.dev.mycompany.com ,	you might	consider	using	DNS	search	domains	and	using environment-unaware	names	 for	example,	myservice :   docker	run	--rm	\ 				--dns-search	dev.mycompany	\							1 				alpine:3.8	\ 				nslookup	myservice																	2  docker	run	--rm	\ 				--dns-search	test.mycompany	\						3 				alpine:3.8	\ 				nslookup	myservice																	4  1	Note	dev	prefix.  3	Note	test	prefix.  2	Resolves	to	myservice.dev.mycompany  4	Resolves	to	myservice.test.mycompany  Using	this	pattern,	the	only	change	is	the	context	in	which	the program	is	running.	As	with	providing	custom	DNS	servers, you	can	provide	several	custom	search	domains	for	the	same container.	Simply	set	the	flag	as	many	times	as	you	have search	domains.	For	example:  docker	run	--rm	\ 				--dns-search	mycompany	\ 				--dns-search	myothercompany	...  This	flag	can	also	be	set	when	you	start	up	the	Docker	engine to	provide	defaults	for	every	container	created.	Again, remember	that	these	options	are	set	for	a	container	only	when it	is	created.	If	you	change	the	defaults	when	a	container	is running,	that	container	will	maintain	the	old	values.  The	last	DNS	feature	to	consider	provides	the	ability	to override	the	DNS	system.	This	uses	the	same	system	that	the	- -hostname	flag	uses.	The	--add-host=[]	flag	on	the docker	run	command	lets	you	provide	a	custom	mapping   for	an	IP	address	and	hostname	pair:  docker	run	--rm	\ 				--add-host	test:10.10.10.255	\				1 				alpine:3.8	\ 				nslookup	test																					2  1	Adds	host	entry  2	Resolves	to	10.10.10.255  Like	--dns	and	--dns-search,	this	option	can	be specified	multiple	times.	But	unlike	those	other	options,	this flag	can’t	be	set	as	a	default	at	engine	startup.  This	feature	is	a	sort	of	name-resolution	scalpel.	Providing specific	name	mappings	for	individual	containers	is	the	most fine-grained	customization	possible.	You	can	use	this	to effectively	block	targeted	hostnames	by	mapping	them	to	a known	IP	address	such	as	127.0.0.1.	You	could	use	it	to	route traffic	for	a	particular	destination	through	a	proxy.	This	is often	used	to	route	unsecure	traffic	through	secure	channels such	as	an	SSH	tunnel.	Adding	these	overrides	is	a	trick	that has	been	used	for	years	by	web	developers	who	run	their	own local	copies	of	a	web	application.	If	you	spend	some	time thinking	about	the	interface	that	name-to-IP	address	mappings provide,	we’re	sure	you	can	come	up	with	all	sorts	of	uses.  All	the	custom	mappings	live	in	a	file	at	 etc hosts	inside	your container.	If	you	want	to	see	what	overrides	are	in	place,	all you	have	to	do	is	inspect	that	file.	Rules	for	editing	and parsing	this	file	can	be	found	online	and	are	a	bit	beyond	the scope	of	this	book:   docker	run	--rm	\ 				--hostname	mycontainer	\													1 				--add-host	docker.com:127.0.0.1	\				2 				--add-host	test:10.10.10.2	\									3 				alpine:3.8	\ 				cat	 etc hosts																							4  1	Sets	hostname  2	Creates	host	entry  3	Creates	another	host	entry  4	Views	all	entries  This	should	produce	output	that	looks	something	like	the following:  172.17.0.45		mycontainer 127.0.0.1				localhost ::1										localhost	ip6-localhost	ip6-loopback fe00::0						ip6-localnet ff00::0						ip6-mcastprefix ff02::1						ip6-allnodes ff02::2						ip6-allrouters 10.10.10.2			test 127.0.0.1				docker.com  DNS	is	a	powerful	system	for	changing	behavior.	The	name- to-IP	address	map	provides	a	simple	interface	that	people	and programs	can	use	to	decouple	themselves	from	specific network	addresses.	If	DNS	is	your	best	tool	for	changing outbound	traffic	behavior,	then	the	firewall	and	network topology	is	your	best	tool	for	controlling	inbound	traffic.  5.5.3.	Externalizing	network	management  Finally,	some	organizations,	infrastructures,	or	products require	direct	management	of	container	network	configuration,   service	discovery,	and	other	network-related	resources.	In those	cases,	you	or	the	container	orchestrator	you	are	using will	create	containers	by	using	the	Docker	none	network. Then	use	some	other	container-aware	tooling	to	create	and manage	the	container	network	interfaces,	manage	NodePort publishing,	register	containers	with	service-discovery	systems, and	integrate	with	upstream	load-balancing	systems.  Kubernetes	has	a	whole	ecosystem	of	networking	providers, and	depending	on	how	you	are	consuming	Kubernetes	 as	the project,	a	productized	distribution,	or	managed	service ,	you may	or	may	not	have	any	say	in	which	provider	you	use. Entire	books	could	be	written	about	networking	options	for Kubernetes.	I	won’t	do	them	the	disservice	of	attempting	to summarize	them	here.  Above	the	network	provider	layer,	a	whole	continuum	of service-discovery	tools	use	various	features	of	Linux	and container	technology.	Service	discovery	is	not	a	solved problem,	so	the	solution	landscape	changes	quickly.	If	you find	Docker	networking	constructs	insufficient	to	solve	your integration	and	management	problems,	survey	the	field.	Each tool	has	its	own	documentation	and	implementation	patterns, and	you	will	need	to	consult	those	guides	to	integrate	them effectively	with	Docker.  When	you	externalize	network	management,	Docker	is	still responsible	for	creating	the	network	namespace	for	the container,	but	it	will	not	create	or	manage	any	of	the	network interfaces.	You	will	not	be	able	to	use	any	of	the	Docker tooling	to	inspect	the	network	configuration	or	port	mapping.   If	you	are	running	a	blended	environment	in	which	some container	networking	has	been	externalized,	the	built-in service	discovery	mechanisms	cannot	be	used	to	route	traffic from	Docker-managed	containers	to	externalized	containers. Blended	environments	are	rare	and	should	be	avoided.   SUMMARY  Networking	is	a	broad	subject	that	would	take	several	books	to cover	properly.	This	chapter	should	help	readers	with	a	basic understanding	of	network	fundamentals	adopt	the	single-host networking	facilities	provided	by	Docker.	In	reading	this material,	you	learned	the	following:  Docker	networks	are	first-class	entities	that	can	be	created,	listed,	and removed	just	like	containers,	volumes,	and	images.  Bridge	networks	are	a	special	kind	of	network	that	allows	direct intercontainer	network	communication	with	built-in	container	name resolution.  Docker	provides	two	other	special	networks	by	default:	host	and	none.  Networks	created	with	the	none	driver	will	isolate	attached	containers from	the	network.  A	container	on	a	host	network	will	have	full	access	to	the	network facilities	and	interfaces	on	the	host.  Forward	network	traffic	to	a	host	port	into	a	target	container	and	port	with NodePort	publishing.  Docker	bridge	networks	do	not	provide	any	network	firewall	or	access- control	functionality.  The	network	name-resolution	stack	can	be	customized	for	each	container. Custom	DNS	servers,	search	domains,	and	static	hosts	can	be	defined.  Network	management	can	be	externalized	with	third-party	tooling	and	by using	the	Docker	none	network.   Chapter	6.	Limiting	risk	with	resource controls  This	chapter	covers  Setting	resource	limits  Sharing	container	memory  Setting	users,	permissions,	and	administrative	privileges  Granting	access	to	specific	Linux	features  Working	with	SELinux	and	AppArmor  Containers	provide	isolated	process	contexts,	not	whole system	virtualization.	The	semantic	difference	may	seem subtle,	but	the	impact	is	drastic.	Chapter	1	touched	on	the differences	a	bit.	Chapters	2	through	5	each	covered	a	different isolation	feature	set	of	Docker	containers.	This	chapter	covers the	remaining	four	and	includes	information	about	enhancing security	on	your	system.  The	features	covered	in	this	chapter	focus	on	managing	or limiting	the	risks	of	running	software.	These	features	prevent software	from	misbehaving	because	of	a	bug	or	attack	from consuming	resources	that	might	leave	your	computer unresponsive.	Containers	can	help	ensure	that	software	only uses	the	computing	resources	and	accesses	the	data	you expect.	You	will	learn	how	to	give	containers	resource allowances,	access	shared	memory,	run	programs	as	specific users,	control	the	type	of	changes	that	a	container	can	make	to your	computer,	and	integrate	with	other	Linux	isolation	tools.   Some	of	these	topics	involve	Linux	features	that	are	beyond the	scope	of	this	book.	In	those	cases,	we	try	to	give	you	an idea	about	their	purpose	and	basic	usage	examples,	and	how you	can	integrate	them	with	Docker.	Figure	6.1	shows	the eight	namespaces	and	features	that	are	used	to	build	Docker containers.  Figure	6.1.	Eight-sided	containers  One	last	reminder:	Docker	and	the	technology	it	uses	are evolving	projects.	The	examples	in	this	chapter	should	work for	Docker	1.13	and	later.	Once	you	learn	the	tools	presented in	this	chapter,	remember	to	check	for	developments, enhancements,	and	new	best	practices	when	you	go	to	build something	valuable.   6.1.	SETTING	RESOURCE	ALLOWANCES  Physical	system	resources	such	as	memory	and	time	on	the CPU	are	scarce.	If	the	resource	consumption	of	processes	on	a computer	exceeds	the	available	physical	resources,	the processes	will	experience	performance	issues	and	may	stop running.	Part	of	building	a	system	that	creates	strong	isolation includes	providing	resource	allowances	on	individual containers.  If	you	want	to	make	sure	that	a	program	won’t	overwhelm other	programs	on	your	computer,	the	easiest	thing	to	do	is	set limits	on	the	resources	that	it	can	use.	You	can	manage memory,	CPU,	and	device	resource	allowances	with	Docker. By	default,	Docker	containers	may	use	unlimited	CPU, memory,	and	device	I O	resources.	The	docker container	create	and	run	commands	provide	flags	for managing	resources	available	to	the	container.  6.1.1.	Memory	limits  Memory	limits	are	the	most	basic	restriction	you	can	place	on	a container.	They	restrict	the	amount	of	memory	that	processes inside	a	container	can	use.	Memory	limits	are	useful	for ensuring	that	one	container	can’t	allocate	all	of	the	system’s memory,	starving	other	programs	for	the	memory	they	need. You	can	put	a	limit	in	place	by	using	the	-m	or	--memory flag	on	the	docker	container	run	or	docker container	create	commands.	The	flag	takes	a	value	and   a	unit.	The	format	is	as	follows:    	where	unit	=	b,	k,	m	or	g  In	the	context	of	these	commands,	b	refers	to	bytes,	k	to kilobytes,	m	to	megabytes,	and	g	to	gigabytes.	Put	this	new knowledge	to	use	and	start	up	a	database	application	that you’ll	use	in	other	examples:  docker	container	run	-d	--name	ch6_mariadb	\ 				--memory	256m	\																													1 				--cpu-shares	1024	\ 				--cap-drop	net_raw	\ 				-e	MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=test	\ 				mariadb:5.5  1	Sets	a	memory	constraint  With	this	command,	you	install	database	software	called MariaDB	and	start	a	container	with	a	memory	limit	of	256 megabytes.	You	might	have	noticed	a	few	extra	flags	on	this command.	This	chapter	covers	each	of	those,	but	you	may already	be	able	to	guess	what	they	do.	Something	else	to	note is	that	you	don’t	expose	any	ports	or	bind	any	ports	to	the host’s	interfaces.	It	will	be	easiest	to	connect	to	this	database by	linking	to	it	from	another	container	on	the	host.	Before	we get	to	that,	we	want	to	make	sure	you	have	a	full understanding	of	what	happens	here	and	how	to	use	memory limits.  The	most	important	thing	to	understand	about	memory	limits is	that	they’re	not	reservations.	They	don’t	guarantee	that	the specified	amount	of	memory	will	be	available.	They’re	only	a   protection	from	overconsumption.	Additionally,	the implementation	of	the	memory	accounting	and	limit enforcement	by	the	Linux	kernel	is	very	efficient,	so	you	don’t need	to	worry	about	runtime	overhead	for	this	feature.  Before	you	put	a	memory	allowance	in	place,	you	should consider	two	things.	First,	can	the	software	you’re	running operate	under	the	proposed	memory	allowance?	Second,	can the	system	you’re	running	on	support	the	allowance?  The	first	question	is	often	difficult	to	answer.	It’s	not	common to	see	minimum	requirements	published	with	open	source software	these	days.	Even	if	it	were,	though,	you’d	have	to understand	how	the	memory	requirements	of	the	software scale	based	on	the	size	of	the	data	you’re	asking	it	to	handle. For	better	or	worse,	people	tend	to	overestimate	and	adjust based	on	trial	and	error.	One	option	is	to	run	the	software	in	a container	with	real	workloads	and	use	the	docker	stats command	to	see	how	much	memory	the	container	uses	in practice.	For	the	mariadb	container	we	just	started,	docker stats	ch6_mariadb	shows	that	the	container	is	using about	100	megabytes	of	memory,	fitting	well	inside	its	256- megabyte	limit.	In	the	case	of	memory-sensitive	tools	like databases,	skilled	professionals	such	as	database administrators	can	make	better-educated	estimates	and recommendations.	Even	then,	the	question	is	often	answered by	another:	how	much	memory	do	you	have?	And	that	leads	to the	second	question.  Can	the	system	you’re	running	on	support	the	allowance?	It’s possible	to	set	a	memory	allowance	that’s	bigger	than	the   amount	of	available	memory	on	the	system.	On	hosts	that	have swap	space	 virtual	memory	that	extends	onto	disk ,	a container	may	realize	the	allowance.	It	is	possible	to	specify an	allowance	that’s	greater	than	any	physical	memory resource.	In	those	cases,	the	limitations	of	the	system	will always	cap	the	container,	and	runtime	behavior	will	be	similar to	not	having	specified	an	allowance	at	all.  Finally,	understand	that	there	are	several	ways	that	software can	fail	if	it	exhausts	the	available	memory.	Some	programs may	fail	with	a	memory	access	fault,	whereas	others	may	start writing	out-of-memory	errors	to	their	logging.	Docker	neither detects	this	problem	nor	attempts	to	mitigate	the	issue.	The best	it	can	do	is	apply	the	restart	logic	you	may	have	specified using	the	--restart	flag	described	in	chapter	2.  6.1.2.	CPU  Processing	time	is	just	as	scarce	as	memory,	but	the	effect	of starvation	is	performance	degradation	instead	of	failure.	A paused	process	that	is	waiting	for	time	on	the	CPU	is	still working	correctly.	But	a	slow	process	may	be	worse	than	a failing	one	if	it’s	running	an	important	latency-sensitive	data- processing	program,	a	revenue-generating	web	application,	or a	backend	service	for	your	app.	Docker	lets	you	limit	a container’s	CPU	resources	in	two	ways.  First,	you	can	specify	the	relative	weight	of	a	container	to other	containers.	Linux	uses	this	to	determine	the	percentage of	CPU	time	the	container	should	use	relative	to	other	running containers.	That	percentage	is	for	the	sum	of	the	computing   cycles	of	all	processors	available	to	the	container.  To	set	the	CPU	shares	of	a	container	and	establish	its	relative weight,	both	docker	container	run	and	docker container	create	offer	a	--cpu-shares	flag.	The value	provided	should	be	an	integer	 which	means	you shouldn’t	quote	it .	Start	another	container	to	see	how	CPU shares	work:  docker	container	run	-d	-P	--name	ch6_wordpress	\ --memory	512m	\ --cpu-shares	512	\											1 --cap-drop	net_raw	\ --link	ch6_mariadb:mysql	\ -e	WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD=test	\ wordpress:5.0.0-php7.2-apache  1	Sets	a	relative	process	weight  This	command	will	download	and	start	WordPress	version	5.0. It’s	written	in	PHP	and	is	a	great	example	of	software	that	has been	challenged	by	adapting	to	security	risks.	Here	we’ve started	it	with	a	few	extra	precautions.	If	you’d	like	to	see	it running	on	your	computer,	use	docker	port ch6_wordpress	to	get	the	port	number	 we’ll	call	it   	that	the	service	is	running	on	and	open http:  localhost: 	in	your	web	browser.	If	you’re	using Docker	Machine,	you’ll	need	to	use	docker-machine	ip to	determine	the	IP	address	of	the	virtual	machine	where Docker	is	running.	When	you	have	that,	substitute	that	value for	localhost	in	the	preceding	URL.  When	you	started	the	MariaDB	container,	you	set	its	relative weight	 cpu-shares 	to	1024,	and	you	set	the	relative   weight	of	WordPress	to	512.	These	settings	create	a	system	in which	the	MariaDB	container	gets	two	CPU	cycles	for	every one	WordPress	cycle.	If	you	started	a	third	container	and	set its	--cpu-shares	value	to	2048,	it	would	get	half	of	the CPU	cycles,	and	MariaDB	and	WordPress	would	split	the other	half	at	the	same	proportions	as	they	were	before.	Figure 6.2	shows	how	portions	change	based	on	the	total	weight	of the	system.  Figure	6.2.	Relative	weight	and	CPU	shares  CPU	shares	differ	from	memory	limits	in	that	they’re	enforced only	when	there	is	contention	for	time	on	the	CPU.	If	other processes	and	containers	are	idle,	the	container	may	burst	well beyond	its	limits.	This	approach	ensures	that	CPU	time	is	not wasted	and	that	limited	processes	will	yield	if	another	process needs	the	CPU.	The	intent	of	this	tool	is	to	prevent	one	or	a	set of	processes	from	overwhelming	a	computer,	not	to	hinder performance	of	those	processes.	The	defaults	won’t	limit	the container,	and	it	will	be	able	to	use	100%	of	the	CPU	if	the machine	is	otherwise	idle.  Now	that	you	have	learned	how	cpu-shares	allocates	CPU proportionately,	we	will	introduce	the	cpus	option,	which provides	a	way	to	limit	the	total	amount	of	CPU	used	by	a container.	The	cpus	option	allocates	a	quota	of	CPU   resources	the	container	may	use	by	configuring	the	Linux Completely	Fair	Scheduler	 CFS .	Docker	helpfully	allows	the quota	to	be	expressed	as	the	number	of	CPU	cores	the container	should	be	able	to	use.	The	CPU	quota	is	allocated, enforced,	and	ultimately	refreshed	every	100ms	by	default.	If	a container	uses	all	of	its	CPU	quota,	its	CPU	usage	will	be throttled	until	the	next	measurement	period	begins.	The following	command	will	let	the	previous	WordPress	example consume	a	maximum	of	0.75	CPU	cores:  docker	container	run	-d	-P	--name	ch6_wordpress	\ --memory	512m	\ --cpus	0.75	\																1 --cap-drop	net_raw	\ --link	ch6_mariadb:mysql	\ -e	WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD=test	\ wordpress:5.0.0-php7.2-apache  1	Uses	a	maximum	of	0.75	cpus  Another	feature	Docker	exposes	is	the	ability	to	assign	a container	to	a	specific	CPU	set.	Most	modern	hardware	uses multicore	CPUs.	Roughly	speaking,	a	CPU	can	process	as many	instructions	in	parallel	as	it	has	cores.	This	is	especially useful	when	you’re	running	many	processes	on	the	same computer.  A	context	switch	is	the	task	of	changing	from	executing	one process	to	executing	another.	Context	switching	is	expensive and	may	cause	a	noticeable	impact	on	the	performance	of	your system.	In	some	cases,	it	makes	sense	to	reduce	context switching	of	critical	processes	by	ensuring	they	are	never executed	on	the	same	set	of	CPU	cores.	You	can	use	the	-- cpuset-cpus	flag	on	docker	container	run	or   docker	container	create	to	limit	a	container	to execute	only	on	a	specific	set	of	CPU	cores.  You	can	see	the	CPU	set	restrictions	in	action	by	stressing	one of	your	machine	cores	and	examining	your	CPU	workload:  	Start	a	container	limited	to	a	single	CPU	and	run	a	load	 generator docker	container	run	-d	\ 				--cpuset-cpus	0	\																																			1 				--name	ch6_stresser	dockerinaction ch6_stresser  	Start	a	container	to	watch	the	load	on	the	CPU	under	load docker	container	run	-it	--rm	dockerinaction ch6_htop  1	Restricts	to	CPU	number	0  Once	you	run	the	second	command,	you’ll	see	htop	display the	running	processes	and	the	workload	of	the	available	CPUs. The	ch6_stresser	container	will	stop	running	after	30 seconds,	so	it’s	important	not	to	delay	when	you	run	this experiment.	When	you	finish	with	htop,	press	Q	to	quit. Before	moving	on,	remember	to	shut	down	and	remove	the container	named	ch6_stresser:  docker	rm	-vf	ch6_stresser  We	thought	this	was	exciting	when	we	first	used	it.	To	get	the best	appreciation,	repeat	this	experiment	a	few	times	by	using different	values	for	the	--cpuset-cpus	flag.	If	you	do, you’ll	see	the	process	assigned	to	different	cores	or	different sets	of	cores.	The	value	can	be	either	a	list	or	range:  0,1,2—	A	list	including	the	first	three	cores	of	the	CPU   0-2—	A	range	including	the	first	three	cores	of	the	CPU  6.1.3.	Access	to	devices  Devices	are	the	final	resource	type	we	will	cover.	Controlling access	to	devices	differs	from	memory	and	CPU	limits. Providing	access	to	a	host’s	device	inside	a	container	is	more like	a	resource-authorization	control	than	a	limit.  Linux	systems	have	all	sorts	of	devices,	including	hard	drives, optical	drives,	USB	drives,	mouse,	keyboard,	sound	devices, and	webcams.	Containers	have	access	to	some	of	the	host’s devices	by	default,	and	Docker	creates	other	devices specifically	for	each	container.	This	works	similarly	to	how	a virtual	terminal	provides	dedicated	input	and	output	devices	to the	user.  On	occasion,	it	may	be	important	to	share	other	devices between	a	host	and	a	specific	container.	Say	you’re	running computer	vision	software	that	requires	access	to	a	webcam,	for example.	In	that	case,	you’ll	need	to	grant	access	to	the container	running	your	software	to	the	webcam	device attached	to	the	system;	you	can	use	the	--device	flag	to specify	a	set	of	devices	to	mount	into	the	new	container.	The following	example	would	map	your	webcam	at	 dev video0	to the	same	location	within	a	new	container.	Running	this example	will	work	only	if	you	have	a	webcam	at	 dev video0:  docker	container	run	-it	--rm	\ 				--device	 dev video0: dev video0	\					1 				ubuntu:16.04	ls	-al	 dev  1	Mounts	video0   The	value	provided	must	be	a	map	between	the	device	file	on the	host	operating	system	and	the	location	inside	the	new container.	The	device	flag	can	be	set	many	times	to	grant access	to	different	devices.  People	in	situations	with	custom	hardware	or	proprietary drivers	will	find	this	kind	of	access	to	devices	useful.	It’s preferable	to	resorting	to	modifying	their	host	operating system.   6.2.	SHARING	MEMORY  Linux	provides	a	few	tools	for	sharing	memory	between processes	running	on	the	same	computer.	This	form	of interprocess	communication	 IPC 	performs	at	memory speeds.	It’s	often	used	when	the	latency	associated	with network	or	pipe-based	IPC	drags	software	performance	down below	requirements.	The	best	examples	of	shared	memory- based	IPC	use	are	in	scientific	computing	and	some	popular database	technologies	such	as	PostgreSQL.  Docker	creates	a	unique	IPC	namespace	for	each	container	by default.	The	Linux	IPC	namespace	partitions	share	memory primitives	such	as	named	shared	memory	blocks	and semaphores,	as	well	as	message	queues.	It’s	OK	if	you’re	not sure	what	these	are.	Just	know	that	they’re	tools	used	by	Linux programs	to	coordinate	processing.	The	IPC	namespace prevents	processes	in	one	container	from	accessing	the memory	on	the	host	or	in	other	containers.  6.2.1.	Sharing	IPC	primitives	between	containers  We’ve	created	an	image	named dockerinactionch6_ipc	that	contains	both	a	producer and	consumer.	They	communicate	using	shared	memory.	The following	will	help	you	understand	the	problem	with	running these	in	separate	containers:  docker	container	run	-d	-u	nobody	--name	ch6_ipc_producer	\					 1   				--ipc	shareable	\ 				dockerinaction ch6_ipc	-producer  docker	container	run	-d	-u	nobody	--name	ch6_ipc_consumer	\					 2 				dockerinaction ch6_ipc	-consumer  1	Starts	producer  2	Starts	consumer  These	commands	start	two	containers.	The	first	creates	a message	queue	and	begins	broadcasting	messages	on	it.	The second	should	pull	from	the	message	queue	and	write	the messages	to	the	logs.	You	can	see	what	each	is	doing	by	using the	following	commands	to	inspect	the	logs	of	each:  docker	logs	ch6_ipc_producer 	 docker	logs	ch6_ipc_consumer  Notice	that	something	is	wrong	with	the	containers	you started.	The	consumer	never	sees	any	messages	on	the	queue. Each	process	uses	the	same	key	to	identify	the	shared	memory resource,	but	they	refer	to	different	memory.	The	reason	is	that each	container	has	its	own	shared	memory	namespace.  If	you	need	to	run	programs	that	communicate	with	shared memory	in	different	containers,	then	you’ll	need	to	join	their IPC	namespaces	with	the	--ipc	flag.	The	--ipc	flag	has	a container	mode	that	will	create	a	new	container	in	the	same IPC	namespace	as	another	target	container.	This	works	like	the --network	flag	covered	in	chapter	5.	Figure	6.3	illustrates the	relationship	between	containers	and	their	namespaced shared	memory	pools.   Figure	6.3.	Three	containers	and	their	shared	memory	pools;	producer	and	consumer	share	a single	pool.  Use	the	following	commands	to	test	joined	IPC	namespaces for	yourself:  docker	container	rm	-v	ch6_ipc_consumer															1  docker	container	run	-d	--name	ch6_ipc_consumer	\					2 				--ipc	container:ch6_ipc_producer	\																3 				dockerinaction ch6_ipc	-consumer  1	Removes	original	consumer  2	Starts	new	consumer  3	Joins	IPC	namespace  These	commands	rebuild	the	consumer	container	and	reuse	the IPC	namespace	of	the	ch6_ipc_producer	container.	This time,	the	consumer	should	be	able	to	access	the	same	memory location	where	the	server	is	writing.	You	can	see	this	working by	using	the	following	commands	to	inspect	the	logs	of	each:  docker	logs	ch6_ipc_producer 	 docker	logs	ch6_ipc_consumer   Remember	to	clean	up	your	running	containers	before	moving on:  docker	rm	-vf	ch6_ipc_producer	ch6_ipc_consumer  The	v	option	will	clean	up	volumes.  The	f	option	will	kill	the	container	if	it	is	running.  The	rm	command	takes	a	list	of	containers.  Reusing	the	shared	memory	namespaces	of	containers	has obvious	security	implications.	But	this	option	is	available	if you	need	it.	Sharing	memory	between	containers	is	a	safer alternative	than	sharing	memory	with	the	host.	Sharing memory	with	the	host	is	possible	using	the	--ipc=host option.	However,	sharing	host	memory	is	difficult	in	modern Docker	distributions	because	it	contradicts	Docker’s	secure- by-default	posture	for	containers.  Feel	free	to	check	out	the	source	code	for	this	example.	It’s	an ugly	but	simple	C	program.	You	can	find	it	by	checking	out the	source	repository	linked	from	the	image’s	page	on	Docker Hub.   6.3.	UNDERSTANDING	USERS  Docker	starts	containers	as	the	user	that	is	specified	by	the image	metadata	by	default,	which	is	often	the	root	user.	The root	user	has	almost	full	privileged	access	to	the	state	of	the container.	Any	processes	running	as	that	user	inherit	those permissions.	It	follows	that	if	there’s	a	bug	in	one	of	those processes,	it	might	damage	the	container.	There	are	ways	to limit	the	damage,	but	the	most	effective	way	to	prevent	these types	of	issues	is	not	to	use	the	root	user.  Reasonable	exceptions	exist;	sometimes	using	the	root	user	is the	best	or	only	available	option.	You	use	the	root	user	for building	images,	and	at	runtime	when	there’s	no	other	option. Similarly,	at	times	you	might	want	to	run	system administration	software	inside	a	container.	In	those	cases,	the process	needs	privileged	access	not	only	to	the	container	but also	to	the	host	operating	system.	This	section	covers	the	range of	solutions	to	these	problems.  6.3.1.	Working	with	the	run-as	user  Before	you	create	a	container,	it	would	be	nice	to	be	able	to know	what	username	 and	user	ID 	is	going	to	be	used	by default.	The	default	is	specified	by	the	image.	There’s currently	no	way	to	examine	an	image	to	discover	attributes such	as	the	default	user	in	Docker	Hub.	You	can	inspect	image metadata	by	using	the	docker	inspect	command.	If	you missed	it	in	chapter	2,	the	inspect	subcommand	displays   the	metadata	of	a	specific	container	or	image.	Once	you’ve pulled	or	created	an	image,	you	can	get	the	default	username that	the	container	is	using	with	the	following	commands:  docker	image	pull	busybox:1.29 docker	image	inspect	busybox:1.29																										1 docker	inspect	--format	"{{.Config.User}}"	busybox:1.29				2  1	Displays	all	of	busybox’s	metadata  2	Shows	only	the	run-as	user	defined	by	the	busybox	image  If	the	result	is	blank,	the	container	will	default	to	running	as the	root	user.	If	it	isn’t	blank,	either	the	image	author specifically	named	a	default	run-as	user	or	you	set	a	specific run-as	user	when	you	created	the	container.	The	--format or	-f	option	used	in	the	second	command	allows	you	to specify	a	template	to	render	the	output.	In	this	case,	you’ve selected	the	User	field	of	the	Config	property	of	the document.	The	value	can	be	any	valid	Golang	template,	so	if you’re	feeling	up	to	it,	you	can	get	creative	with	the	results.  This	approach	has	a	problem.	The	run-as	user	might	be changed	by	the	entrypoint	or	command	the	image	uses	to	start up.	These	are	sometimes	referred	to	as	boot,	or	init,	scripts. The	metadata	returned	by	docker	inspect	includes	only the	configuration	that	the	container	will	start	with.	So	if	the user	changes,	it	won’t	be	reflected	there.  Currently,	the	only	way	to	fix	this	problem	is	to	look	inside	the image.	You	could	expand	the	image	files	after	you	download them,	and	examine	the	metadata	and	init	scripts	by	hand,	but doing	so	is	time-consuming	and	easy	to	get	wrong.	For	the   time	being,	it	may	be	better	to	run	a	simple	experiment	to determine	the	default	user.	This	will	solve	the	first	problem but	not	the	second:  docker	container	run	--rm	--entrypoint	""	busybox:1.29	whoami					 1  docker	container	run	--rm	--entrypoint	""	busybox:1.29	id									 2  1	Outputs:	root  2	Outputs:	uid=0 root 	gid=0 root 	groups=10 wheel   This	demonstrates	two	commands	that	you	might	use	to determine	the	default	user	of	an	image	 in	this	case, busybox:1.29 .	Both	the	whoami	and	id	commands	are common	among	Linux	distributions,	and	so	they’re	likely	to be	available	in	any	given	image.	The	second	command	is superior	because	it	shows	both	the	name	and	ID	details	for	the run-as	user.	Both	these	commands	are	careful	to	unset	the entrypoint	of	the	container.	This	will	make	sure	that	the command	specified	after	the	image	name	is	the	command	that is	executed	by	the	container.	These	are	poor	substitutes	for	a first-class	image	metadata	tool,	but	they	get	the	job	done. Consider	the	brief	exchange	between	two	root	users	in	figure 6.4.  Figure	6.4.	Root	versus	root—a	security	drama   You	can	entirely	avoid	the	default	user	problem	if	you	change the	run-as	user	when	you	create	the	container.	The	quirk	with using	this	is	that	the	username	must	exist	on	the	image	you’re using.	Different	Linux	distributions	ship	with	different	users predefined,	and	some	image	authors	reduce	or	augment	that set.	You	can	get	a	list	of	available	users	in	an	image	with	the following	command:  docker	container	run	--rm	busybox:1.29	awk	-F:	'$0=$1'  etc passwd  We	won’t	go	into	much	detail	here,	but	the	Linux	user database	is	stored	in	a	file	located	at	 etc passwd.	This   command	will	read	that	file	from	the	container	filesystem	and pull	the	list	of	usernames.	Once	you’ve	identified	the	user	you want	to	use,	you	can	create	a	new	container	with	a	specific run-as	user.	Docker	provides	the	--user	or	-u	flag	on docker	container	run	and	docker	container create	for	setting	the	user.	This	will	set	the	user	to nobody:  docker	container	run	--rm	\ 				--user	nobody	\											1 				busybox:1.29	id											2  1	Sets	run-as	user	to	nobody  2	Outputs:	uid=65534 nobody 	gid=65534 nogroup   This	command	used	the	nobody	user.	That	user	is	common and	intended	for	use	in	restricted-privileges	scenarios	such	as running	applications.	That	is	just	one	example.	You	can	use any	username	defined	by	the	image	here,	including	root.	This only	scratches	the	surface	of	what	you	can	do	with	the	-u	or	- -user	flag.	The	value	can	accept	any	user	or	group	pair. When	you	specify	a	user	by	name,	that	name	is	resolved	to	the user	ID	 UID 	specified	in	the	container’s	passwd	file.	Then the	command	is	run	with	that	UID.	This	leads	to	another feature.	The	--user	flag	also	accepts	user	and	group	names or	IDs.	When	you	use	IDs	instead	of	names,	the	options	start to	open	up:  docker	container	run	--rm	\ 				-u	nobody:nogroup	\								1 				busybox:1.29	id												2  docker	container	run	--rm	\ 				-u	10000:20000	\											3   				busybox:1.29	id												4  1	Sets	run-as	user	to	nobody	and	group	to	nogroup  2	Outputs:	uid=65534 nobody 	gid=65534 nogroup   3	Sets	UID	and	GID  4	Outputs:	uid=10000	gid=20000  The	second	command	starts	a	new	container	that	sets	the	run- as	user	and	group	to	a	user	and	group	that	do	not	exist	in	the container.	When	that	happens,	the	IDs	won’t	resolve	to	a	user or	group	name,	but	all	file	permissions	will	work	as	if	the	user and	group	did	exist.	Depending	on	how	the	software	packaged in	the	container	is	configured,	changing	the	run-as	user	may cause	problems.	Otherwise,	this	is	a	powerful	feature	that	can simplify	running	applications	with	limited	privileges	and solving	file-permission	problems.  The	best	way	to	be	confident	in	your	runtime	configuration	is to	pull	images	from	trusted	sources	or	build	your	own.	As	with any	standard	Linux	distribution,	it’s	possible	to	do	malicious things	such	as	turning	a	default	nonroot	user	into	the	root	user by	using	an	suid-enabled	program	or	opening	up	access	to the	root	account	without	authentication.	The	threat	of	the suid	example	can	be	mitigated	by	using	the	custom	container security	options	described	in	section	6.6,	specifically	the	-- security-opt	no-new-privileges	option.	However, that’s	late	in	the	delivery	process	to	address	that	problem.	Like a	full	Linux	host,	images	should	be	analyzed	and	secured using	the	principle	of	least	privilege.	Fortunately,	Docker images	can	be	purpose-built	to	support	the	application	that needs	to	be	run	with	everything	else	left	out.	Chapters	7,	8,   and	10	cover	how	to	create	minimal	application	images.  6.3.2.	Users	and	volumes  Now	that	you’ve	learned	how	users	inside	containers	share	the same	user	ID	space	as	the	users	on	your	host	system,	you	need to	learn	how	those	two	might	interact.	The	main	reason	for that	interaction	is	the	file	permissions	on	files	in	volumes.	For example,	if	you’re	running	a	Linux	terminal,	you	should	be able	to	use	these	commands	directly;	otherwise,	you’ll	need	to use	the	docker-machine	ssh	command	to	get	a	shell	in your	Docker	Machine	virtual	machine:  echo	"e=mc^2"	>	garbage																																								 1  chmod	600	garbage																																														 2  sudo	chown	root	garbage																																								 3  docker	container	run	--rm	-v	"$ pwd " garbage: test garbage	\ 				-u	nobody	\ 				ubuntu:16.04	cat	 test garbage																													 4  docker	container	run	--rm	-v	"$ pwd " garbage: test garbage	\ 				-u	root	ubuntu:16.04	cat	 test garbage																					 5 	Outputs:	"e=mc^2"  	cleanup	that	garbage sudo	rm	-f	garbage  1	Creates	new	file	on	your	host  2	Makes	file	readable	only	by	its	owner  3	Makes	file	owned	by	root	 assuming	you	have	sudo	access   4	Tries	to	read	file	as	nobody   5	Tries	to	read	file	as	“container	root”  The	second-to-last	docker	command	should	fail	with	an error	message	like	Permission	denied.	But	the	last docker	command	should	succeed	and	show	you	the	contents of	the	file	you	created	in	the	first	command.	This	means	that file	permissions	on	files	in	volumes	are	respected	inside	the container.	But	this	also	reflects	that	the	user	ID	space	is shared.	Both	root	on	the	host	and	root	in	the	container	have user	ID	0.	So,	although	the	container’s	nobody	user	with	ID 65534	can’t	access	a	file	owned	by	root	on	the	host,	the container’s	root	user	can.  Unless	you	want	a	file	to	be	accessible	to	a	container,	don’t mount	it	into	that	container	with	a	volume.  The	good	news	about	this	example	is	that	you’ve	seen	how	file permissions	are	respected	and	can	solve	some	more	mundane —but	practical—operational	issues.	For	example,	how	do	you handle	a	log	file	written	to	a	volume?  The	preferred	way	is	with	volumes,	as	described	in	chapter	4. But	even	then	you	need	to	consider	file	ownership	and permission	issues.	If	logs	are	written	to	a	volume	by	a	process running	as	user	1001,	and	another	container	tries	to	access	that file	as	user	1002,	then	file	permissions	might	prevent	the operation.  One	way	to	overcome	this	obstacle	would	be	to	specifically manage	the	user	ID	of	the	running	user.	You	can	either	edit	the image	ahead	of	time	by	setting	the	user	ID	of	the	user	you’re   going	to	run	the	container	with,	or	you	can	use	the	desired	user and	group	ID	 GID :  mkdir	logFiles  sudo	chown	2000:2000	logFiles																																											 1  docker	container	run	--rm	-v	"$ pwd " logFiles: logFiles	\														 2 				-u	2000:2000	ubuntu:16.04	\																																									 3 				 bin bash	-c	"echo	This	is	important	info	>	  logFiles important.log"  docker	container	run	--rm	-v	"$ pwd " logFiles: logFiles	\														 4 				-u	2000:2000	ubuntu:16.04	\																																									 5 				 bin bash	-c	"echo	More	info	>>	 logFiles important.log"  sudo	rm	–r	logFiles  1	Sets	ownership	of	directory	to	desired	user	and	group  2	Writes	important	log	file  3	Sets	UID:GID	to	2000:2000  4	Appends	to	log	from	another	container  5	Also	sets	UID:GID	to	2000:2000  After	running	this	example,	you’ll	see	that	the	file	could	be written	to	the	directory	that’s	owned	by	user	2000.	Not	only that,	but	any	container	that	uses	a	user	or	group	with	write access	to	the	directory	could	write	a	file	in	that	directory	or	to the	same	file	if	the	permissions	allow.	This	trick	works	for reading,	writing,	and	executing	files.  One	UID	and	filesystem	interaction	bears	special	mention.	By default,	the	Docker	daemon	API	is	accessible	via	a	UNIX   domain	socket	located	on	the	host	at	 var run 	docker.sock. The	domain	socket	is	protected	with	filesystem	permissions ensuring	that	only	the	root	user	and	members	of	the	docker group	may	send	commands	or	retrieve	data	from	the	Docker daemon.	Some	programs	are	built	to	interact	directly	with	the Docker	daemon	API	and	know	how	to	send	commands	to inspect	or	run	containers.  The	power	of	the	Docker	API  The	docker	command-line	program	interacts	with	the Docker	daemon	almost	entirely	via	the	API,	which	should	give you	a	sense	of	how	powerful	the	API	is.	Any	program	that	can read	and	write	to	the	Docker	API	can	do	anything	docker can	do,	subject	to	Docker’s	Authorization	plugin	system.  Programs	that	manage	or	monitor	containers	often	require	the ability	to	read	or	even	write	to	the	Docker	daemon’s	endpoint. The	ability	to	read	or	write	to	Docker’s	API	is	often	provided by	running	the	management	program	as	a	user	or	group	that has	permission	to	read	or	write	to	docker.sock	and mounting	 var run docker.sock	into	the	container:  docker	container	run	--rm	-it 		–v	 var run docker.sock: var run docker.sock:ro	\					1 		-u	root		monitoringtool																															2  1	Binds	docker.sock	from	host	into	container	as	a	read-only	file  2	Container	runs	as	root	user,	aligning	with	file	permissions	on	host   The	preceding	example	illustrates	a	relatively	common	request by	authors	of	privileged	programs.	You	should	be	careful about	which	users	or	programs	on	your	systems	can	control your	Docker	daemon.	If	a	user	or	program	controls	your Docker	daemon,	it	effectively	controls	the	root	account	on your	host	and	can	run	any	program	or	delete	any	file.  6.3.3.	Introduction	to	the	Linux	user	namespace	and	UID remapping  Linux’s	user	 USR 	namespace	maps	users	in	one	namespace to	users	in	another.	The	user	namespace	operates	like	the process	identifier	 PID 	namespace	with	container	UIDs	and GIDs	partitioned	from	the	host’s	default	identities.  By	default,	Docker	containers	do	not	use	the	USR	namespace. This	means	that	a	container	running	with	a	user	ID	 number, not	name 	that’s	the	same	as	a	user	on	the	host	machine	has the	same	host	file	permissions	as	that	user.	This	isn’t	a problem.	The	filesystem	available	inside	a	container	has	been mounted	so	that	changes	made	inside	that	container	will	stay inside	that	container’s	filesystem.	But	this	does	impact volumes	in	which	files	are	shared	between	containers	or	with the	host.  When	a	user	namespace	is	enabled	for	a	container,	the container’s	UIDs	are	mapped	to	a	range	of	unprivileged	UIDs on	the	host.	Operators	activate	user	namespace	remapping	by defining	subuid	and	subgid	maps	for	the	host	in	Linux	and configuring	the	Docker	daemon’s	userns-remap	option. The	mappings	determine	how	user	IDs	on	the	host	correspond   to	user	IDs	in	a	container	namespace.	For	example,	UID remapping	could	be	configured	to	map	container	UIDs	to	the host	starting	with	host	UID	5000	and	a	range	of	1000	UIDs. The	result	is	that	UID	0	in	containers	would	be	mapped	to	host UID	5000,	container	UID	1	to	host	UID	5001,	and	so	on	for 1000	UIDs.	Since	UID	5000	is	an	unprivileged	user	from Linux’	perspective	and	doesn’t	have	permissions	to	modify	the host	system	files,	the	risk	of	running	with	uid=0	in	the container	is	greatly	reduced.	Even	if	a	containerized	process gets	ahold	of	a	file	or	other	resource	from	the	host,	the containerized	process	will	be	running	as	a	remapped	UID without	privileges	to	do	anything	with	that	resource	unless	an operator	specifically	gave	it	permissions	to	do	so.  User	namespace	remapping	is	particularly	useful	for	resolving file	permission	issues	in	cases	like	reading	and	writing	to volumes.	Let’s	step	through	an	example	of	sharing	a filesystem	between	containers	whose	process	runs	as	UID	0	in the	container	with	user	namespacing	enabled.	In	our	example, we	will	assume	Docker	is	using	the	following:  The	 default 	dockremap	user	for	remapping	container	UID	and	GID ranges  An	entry	in	 etc subuid	of	dockremap:5000:10000,	providing	a range	of	10,000	UIDs	starting	at	5000  An	entry	in	 etc subgid	of	dockremap:5000:10000,	providing	a range	of	10,000	GIDs	starting	at	5000  First,	let’s	check	the	user	and	group	ID	of	the	dockeremap user	on	the	host.	Then,	we	will	create	a	shared	directory owned	by	the	remapped	container	UID	0,	host	UID	5000.   	id	dockremap																																														1 uid=997 dockremap 	gid=993 dockremap 	groups=993 dockremap  	cat	 etc subuid dockremap:5000:10000 	cat	 etc subgid dockremap:5000:10000 	mkdir	 tmp shared 	chown	-R	5000:5000	 tmp shared																												2  1	Inspects	user	and	group	ID	of	dockremap	user	on	host  2	Changes	ownership	of	“shared”	directory	to	UID	used	for	remapped container	UID	0  Now	run	a	container	as	the	container’s	root	user:  	docker	run	-it	--rm	--user	root	-v	 tmp shared: shared	-v	  : host	alpine	ash  		touch	 host afile																																																							 1 touch:	 host afile:	Permission	denied  		echo	"hello	from	$ id 	in	$ hostname "	>>	 shared afile  		exit 	back	in	the	host	shell 	ls	-la	 tmp shared afile -rw-r--r--.	1	5000	5000	157	Apr	16	00:13	 tmp shared afile  	cat	 tmp shared afile																																																					 2 hello	from	uid=0 root 	gid=0 root 	 groups=0 root ,1 bin ,2 daemon ,									3 					 3 sys ,4 adm ,6 disk ,10 wheel ,11 floppy ,20 dialout ,26 tape , 							3 					27 video 	in	d3b497ac0d34																																														 3  1	The	 host	mount	is	owned	by	host’s	UID	and	GID:	0:0,	so	write disallowed  2	 tmp shared	is	owned	by	host’s	nonprivileged	UID	and	GID: 5000:5000,	so	write	allowed  3	UID	for	root	in	container	was	0  This	example	demonstrates	the	implications	on	filesystem   access	when	using	user	namespaces	with	containers.	User namespaces	can	be	useful	in	tightening	security	of	applications that	run	or	share	data	between	containers	as	a	privileged	user. User	namespace	remapping	can	be	disabled	on	a	per	container basis	when	creating	or	running	the	container,	making	it	easier to	make	it	the	default	execution	mode.	Note	that	user namespaces	are	incompatible	with	some	optional	features	such as	SELinux	or	using	a	privileged	container.	Consult	the Security	documentation	on	the	Docker	website	for	further details	in	designing	and	implementing	a	Docker	configuration leveraging	user	namespace	remapping	that	supports	your	use cases.   6.4.	ADJUSTING	OS	FEATURE	ACCESS	WITH CAPABILITIES  Docker	can	adjust	a	container’s	authorization	to	use	individual operating	system	features.	In	Linux,	these	feature authorizations	are	called	capabilities,	but	as	native	support expands	to	other	operating	systems,	other	backend implementations	would	need	to	be	provided.	Whenever	a process	attempts	to	make	a	gated	system	call	such	as	opening	a network	socket,	the	capabilities	of	that	process	are	checked	for the	required	capability.	The	call	will	succeed	if	the	process	has the	required	capability,	and	fail	otherwise.  When	you	create	a	new	container,	Docker	drops	all capabilities	except	for	an	explicit	list	of	capabilities	that	are necessary	and	safe	to	run	most	applications.	This	further isolates	the	running	process	from	the	administrative	functions of	the	operating	system.	A	sample	of	the	37	dropped capabilities	follows,	and	you	might	be	able	to	guess	at	the reasons	for	their	removal:  SYS_MODULE—	Insert remove	kernel	modules  SYS_RAWIO—	Modify	kernel	memory  SYS_NICE—	Modify	priority	of	processes  SYS_RESOURCE—	Override	resource	limits  SYS_TIME—	Modify	the	system	clock  AUDIT_CONTROL—	Configure	audit	subsystem  MAC_ADMIN—	Configure	MAC	configuration  SYSLOG—	Modify	kernel	print	behavior   NET_ADMIN—	Configure	the	network  SYS_ADMIN—	Catchall	for	administrative	functions  The	default	set	of	capabilities	provided	to	Docker	containers provides	a	reasonable	feature	reduction,	but	at	times	you’ll need	to	add	or	reduce	this	set	further.	For	example,	the capability	NET_RAW	can	be	dangerous.	If	you	wanted	to	be	a bit	more	careful	than	the	default	configuration,	you	could	drop NET_RAW	from	the	list	of	capabilities.	You	can	drop capabilities	from	a	container	by	using	the	--cap-drop	flag on	docker	container	create	or	docker container	run.	First,	print	the	default	capabilities	of	a containerized	process	running	on	your	machine	and	notice	that net_raw	is	in	the	list	of	capabilities:  docker	container	run	--rm	-u	nobody	\ 				ubuntu:16.04	\ 				 bin bash	-c	"capsh	--print		grep	net_raw"  Now,	drop	the	net_raw	capability	when	starting	the container.	Grep	cannot	find	the	string	net_raw	because	the capability	has	been	dropped	and	so	there	is	no	visible	output:  docker	container	run	--rm	-u	nobody	\ 				--cap-drop	net_raw	\																					1 				ubuntu:16.04	\ 				 bin bash	-c	"capsh	--print		grep	net_raw"  1	Drops	NET_RAW	capability  In	Linux	documentation,	you’ll	often	see	capabilities	named	in all	uppercase	and	prefixed	with	CAP_,	but	that	prefix	won’t work	if	provided	to	the	capability-management	options.	Use   unprefixed	and	lowercase	names	for	the	best	results.  Similar	to	the	--cap-drop	flag,	the	--cap-add	flag	will add	capabilities.	If	you	needed	to	add	the	SYS_ADMIN capability	for	some	reason,	you’d	use	a	command	like	the following:  docker	container	run	--rm	-u	nobody	\ 				ubuntu:16.04	\ 				 bin bash	-c	"capsh	--print		grep	sys_admin"							1  docker	container	run	--rm	-u	nobody	\ 				--cap-add	sys_admin	\																															2 				ubuntu:16.04	\ 				 bin bash	-c	"capsh	--print		grep	sys_admin"  1	SYS_ADMIN	is	not	included.  2	Adds	SYS_ADMIN  Like	other	container-creation	options,	both	--cap-add	and --cap-drop	can	be	specified	multiple	times	to	add	or	drop multiple	capabilities,	respectively.	These	flags	can	be	used	to build	containers	that	will	let	a	process	perform	exactly	and only	what	is	required	for	proper	operation.	For	example,	you might	be	able	to	run	a	network	management	daemon	as	the nobody	user	and	give	it	the	NET_ADMIN	capability	instead of	running	it	as	root	directly	on	the	host	or	as	a	privileged container.	If	you	are	wondering	whether	any	capabilities	were added	or	dropped	from	a	container,	you	can	inspect	the container	and	print	the	.HostConfig.CapAdd	and .HostConfig.CapDrop	members	of	the	output.   6.5.	RUNNING	A	CONTAINER	WITH	FULL	PRIVILEGES  When	you	need	to	run	a	system	administration	task	inside	a container,	you	can	grant	that	container	privileged	access	to your	computer.	Privileged	containers	maintain	their	filesystem and	network	isolation	but	have	full	access	to	shared	memory and	devices	and	possess	full	system	capabilities.	You	can perform	several	interesting	tasks,	including	running	Docker inside	a	container,	with	privileged	containers.  The	bulk	of	the	uses	for	privileged	containers	is administrative.	Take,	for	example,	an	environment	in	which the	root	filesystem	is	read-only,	or	installing	software	outside a	container	has	been	disallowed,	or	you	have	no	direct	access to	a	shell	on	the	host.	If	you	wanted	to	run	a	program	to	tune the	operating	system	 for	something	like	load	balancing 	and you	had	access	to	run	a	container	on	that	host,	then	you	could simply	run	that	program	in	a	privileged	container.  If	you	find	a	situation	that	can	be	solved	only	with	the	reduced isolation	of	a	privileged	container,	use	the	--privileged flag	on	docker	container	create	or	docker container	run	to	enable	this	mode:  docker	container	run	--rm	\ 				--privileged	\ 				ubuntu:16.04	id																1  docker	container	run	--rm	\ 				--privileged	\ 				ubuntu:16.04	capsh	--print					2   docker	container	run	--rm	\ 				--privileged	\ 				ubuntu:16.04	ls	 dev											3  docker	container	run	--rm	\ 				--privileged	\ 				ubuntu:16.04	networkctl								4  1	Checks	out	IDs  2	Checks	out	Linux	capabilities  3	Checks	out	list	of	mounted	devices  4	Examines	network	configuration  Privileged	containers	are	still	partially	isolated.	For	example, the	network	namespace	will	still	be	in	effect.	If	you	need	to tear	down	that	namespace,	you’ll	need	to	combine	this	with	- -net	host	as	well.   6.6.	STRENGTHENING	CONTAINERS	WITH	ENHANCED TOOLS  Docker	uses	reasonable	defaults	and	a	“batteries	included” toolset	to	ease	adoption	and	promote	best	practices.	Most modern	Linux	kernels	enable	seccomp,	and	Docker’s	default seccomp	profile	blocks	over	40	kernel	system	calls	 syscalls  that	most	programs	don’t	need.	You	can	enhance	the containers	Docker	builds	if	you	bring	additional	tools.	Tools you	can	use	to	harden	your	containers	include	custom	seccomp profiles,	AppArmor,	and	SELinux.  Whole	books	have	been	written	about	each	of	these	tools. They	bring	their	own	nuances,	benefits,	and	required	skillsets. Their	use	can	be	more	than	worth	the	effort.	Support	for	each varies	by	Linux	distribution,	so	you	may	be	in	for	a	bit	of work.	But	once	you’ve	adjusted	your	host	configuration,	the Docker	integration	is	simpler.  Security	research  The	information	security	space	is	complicated	and	constantly evolving.	It’s	easy	to	feel	overwhelmed	when	reading	through open	conversations	between	InfoSec	professionals.	These	are often	highly	skilled	people	with	long	memories	and	very different	contexts	from	developers	or	general	users.	If	you	can take	away	any	one	thing	from	open	InfoSec	conversations,	it	is that	balancing	system	security	with	user	needs	is	complex.   One	of	the	best	things	you	can	do	if	you’re	new	to	this	space	is start	with	articles,	papers,	blogs,	and	books	before	you	jump into	conversations.	This	will	give	you	an	opportunity	to	digest one	perspective	and	gain	deeper	insight	before	switching	to thoughts	from	a	different	perspective.	When	you’ve	had	an opportunity	to	form	your	own	insight	and	opinions,	these conversations	become	much	more	valuable.  It’s	difficult	to	read	one	paper	or	learn	one	thing	and	know	the best	possible	way	to	build	a	hardened	solution.	Whatever	your situation,	the	system	will	evolve	to	include	improvements from	several	sources.	The	best	thing	you	can	do	is	take	each tool	and	learn	it	by	itself.	Don’t	be	intimidated	by	the	depth some	tools	require	for	a	strong	understanding.	The	effort	will be	worth	the	result,	and	you’ll	understand	the	systems	you	use much	better	for	it.  Docker	isn’t	a	perfect	solution.	Some	would	argue	that	it’s	not even	a	security	tool.	But	the	improvements	it	provides	are	far better	than	the	alternative	of	forgoing	any	isolation	because	of perceived	cost.	If	you’ve	read	this	far,	maybe	you’d	be	willing to	go	further	with	these	auxiliary	topics.  6.6.1.	Specifying	additional	security	options  Docker	provides	a	single	--security-opt	flag	for specifying	options	that	configure	Linux’s	seccomp	and	Linux Security	Modules	 LSM 	features.	Security	options	can	be provided	to	the	docker	container	run	and	docker   container	create	commands.	This	flag	can	be	set multiple	times	to	pass	multiple	values.  Seccomp	configures	which	Linux	system	calls	a	process	may invoke.	Docker’s	default	seccomp	profile	blocks	all	syscalls by	default	and	then	explicitly	permits	more	than	260	syscalls as	safe	for	use	by	most	programs.	The	44	blocked	system	calls are	unneeded	or	are	unsafe	for	normal	programs	 for	example, unshare,	used	in	creating	new	namespaces 	or	cannot	be namespaced	 for	example,	clock_settime,	which	sets	the machine’s	time .	Changing	Docker’s	default	seccomp	profile is	not	recommended.	If	the	default	seccomp	profile	is	too restrictive	or	permissive,	a	custom	profile	can	be	specified	as	a security	option:  docker	container	run	--rm	-it	\ 				--security-opt	seccomp= 	\ 				ubuntu:16.04	sh   	is	the	full	path	to	a	seccomp profile	defining	the	allowed	syscalls	for	the	container.	The Moby	project	on	GitHub	contains	Docker’s	default	seccomp profile	at	profiles seccomp default.json	that	can	be	used	as	a starting	point	for	a	custom	profile.	Use	the	special	value unconfined	to	disable	use	of	seccomp	for	the	container.  Linux	Security	Modules	is	a	framework	Linux	adopted	to	act as	an	interface	layer	between	the	operating	system	and	security providers.	AppArmor	and	SELinux	are	LSM	providers.	Both provide	mandatory	access	control,	or	MAC	 the	system defines	access	rules ,	and	replace	the	standard	Linux   discretionary	access	control	 file	owners	define	access	rules .  The	LSM	security	option	values	are	specified	in	one	of	seven formats:  To	prevent	a	container	from	gaining	new	privileges	after	it	starts,	use	no- new-privileges.  To	set	a	SELinux	user	label,	use	the	form	label=user: , where	 	is	the	name	of	the	user	you	want	to	use	for	the	label.  To	set	a	SELinux	role	label,	use	the	form	label=role: ,	where  	is	the	name	of	the	role	you	want	to	apply	to	processes	in	the container.  To	set	a	SELinux	type	label,	use	the	form	label=type: , where	 	is	the	type	name	of	the	processes	in	the	container.  To	set	a	SELinux-level	label,	use	the	form	label:level: , where	 	is	the	level	at	which	processes	in	the	container	should run.	Levels	are	specified	as	low-high	pairs.	Where	abbreviated	to	the	low level	only,	SELinux	will	interpret	the	range	as	single	level.  To	disable	SELinux	label	confinement	for	a	container,	use	the	form label=	disable.  To	apply	an	AppArmor	profile	on	the	container,	use	the	form apparmor=	 ,	where	 	is	the	name	of	the AppArmor	profile	to	use.  As	you	can	guess	from	these	options,	SELinux	is	a	labeling system.	A	set	of	labels,	called	a	context,	is	applied	to	every	file and	system	object.	A	similar	set	of	labels	is	applied	to	every user	and	process.	At	runtime,	when	a	process	attempts	to interact	with	a	file	or	system	resource,	the	sets	of	labels	are evaluated	against	a	set	of	allowed	rules.	The	result	of	that evaluation	determines	whether	the	interaction	is	allowed	or blocked.   The	last	option	will	set	an	AppArmor	profile.	AppArmor	is frequently	substituted	for	SELinux	because	it	works	with	file paths	instead	of	labels	and	has	a	training	mode	that	you	can use	to	passively	build	profiles	based	on	observed	application behavior.	These	differences	are	often	cited	as	reasons	why AppArmor	is	easier	to	adopt	and	maintain.  Free	and	commercial	tools	that	monitor	a	program’s	execution and	generate	custom	profiles	tailored	for	applications	are available.	These	tools	help	operators	use	information	from actual	program	behavior	in	test	and	production	environments to	create	a	profile	that	works.   6.7.	BUILDING	USE-CASE-APPROPRIATE CONTAINERS  Containers	are	a	cross-cutting	concern.	There	are	more	reasons and	ways	that	people	could	use	them	than	we	could	ever enumerate.	So	it’s	important,	when	you	use	Docker	to	build containers	to	serve	your	own	purposes,	that	you	take	the	time to	do	so	in	a	way	that’s	appropriate	for	the	software	you’re running.  The	most	secure	tactic	for	doing	so	would	be	to	start	with	the most	isolated	container	you	can	build	and	justify	reasons	for weakening	those	restrictions.	In	reality,	people	tend	to	be	a	bit more	reactive	than	proactive.	For	that	reason,	we	think	Docker hits	a	sweet	spot	with	the	default	container	construction.	It provides	reasonable	defaults	without	hindering	the productivity	of	users.  Docker	containers	are	not	the	most	isolated	by	default.	Docker does	not	require	that	you	enhance	those	defaults.	It	will	let	you do	silly	things	in	production	if	you	want	to.	This	makes Docker	seem	much	more	like	a	tool	than	a	burden	and something	people	generally	want	to	use	rather	than	feel	like they	have	to	use.	For	those	who	would	rather	not	do	silly things	in	production,	Docker	provides	a	simple	interface	to enhance	container	isolation.  6.7.1.	Applications   Applications	are	the	whole	reason	we	use	computers.	Most applications	are	programs	that	other	people	wrote	and	that work	with	potentially	malicious	data.	Consider	your	web browser.  A	web	browser	is	a	type	of	application	that’s	installed	on almost	every	computer.	It	interacts	with	web	pages,	images, scripts,	embedded	video,	Flash	documents,	Java	applications, and	anything	else	out	there.	You	certainly	didn’t	create	all	that content,	and	most	people	were	not	contributors	on	web browser	projects.	How	can	you	trust	your	web	browser	to handle	all	that	content	correctly?  Some	more	cavalier	readers	might	just	ignore	the	problem. After	all,	what’s	the	worst	thing	that	could	happen?	Well,	if	an attacker	gains	control	of	your	web	browser	 or	other application ,	they	will	gain	all	the	capabilities	of	that application	and	the	permissions	of	the	user	it’s	running	as. They	could	trash	your	computer,	delete	your	files,	install	other malware,	or	even	launch	attacks	against	other	computers	from yours.	So,	this	isn’t	a	good	thing	to	ignore.	The	question remains:	how	do	you	protect	yourself	when	this	is	a	risk	you need	to	take?  The	best	approach	is	to	isolate	the	risk	of	running	the	program. First,	make	sure	the	application	is	running	as	a	user	with limited	permissions.	That	way,	if	there’s	a	problem,	it	won’t be	able	to	change	the	files	on	your	computer.	Second,	limit	the system	capabilities	of	the	browser.	In	doing	so,	you	make	sure your	system	configuration	is	safer.	Third,	set	limits	on	how much	of	the	CPU	and	memory	the	application	can	use.	Limits   help	reserve	resources	to	keep	the	system	responsive.	Finally, it’s	a	good	idea	to	specifically	whitelist	devices	that	it	can access.	That	will	keep	snoops	off	your	webcam,	USB,	and	the like.  6.7.2.	High-level	system	services  High-level	system	services	are	a	bit	different	from applications.	They’re	not	part	of	the	operating	system,	but your	computer	makes	sure	they’re	started	and	kept	running. These	tools	typically	sit	alongside	applications	outside	the operating	system,	but	they	often	require	privileged	access	to the	operating	system	to	operate	correctly.	They	provide important	functionality	to	users	and	other	software	on	a system.	Examples	include	cron,	syslogd,	dnsmasq, sshd,	and	docker.  If	you’re	unfamiliar	with	these	tools	 hopefully	not	all	of them ,	it’s	all	right.	They	do	things	like	keep	system	logs,	run scheduled	commands,	and	provide	a	way	to	get	a	secure	shell on	the	system	from	the	network,	and	docker	manages containers.  Although	running	services	as	root	is	common,	few	of	them need	full	privileged	access.	Consider	containerizing	services and	use	capabilities	to	tune	their	access	for	the	specific features	they	need.  6.7.3.	Low-level	system	services  Low-level	services	control	things	like	devices	or	the	system’s   network	stack.	They	require	privileged	access	to	the components	of	the	system	they	provide	 for	example,	firewall software	needs	administrative	access	to	the	network	stack .  It’s	rare	to	see	these	run	inside	containers.	Tasks	such	as filesystem	management,	device	management,	and	network management	are	core	host	concerns.	Most	software	run	in containers	is	expected	to	be	portable.	So	machine-specific tasks	like	these	are	a	poor	fit	for	general	container	use	cases.  The	best	exceptions	are	short-running	configuration containers.	For	example,	in	an	environment	where	all deployments	happen	with	Docker	images	and	containers, you’d	want	to	push	network	stack	changes	in	the	same	way you	push	software.	In	this	case,	you	might	push	an	image	with the	configuration	to	the	host	and	make	the	changes	with	a privileged	container.	The	risk	in	this	case	is	reduced	because you	authored	the	configuration	to	be	pushed,	the	container	is not	long	running,	and	changes	like	these	are	simple	to	audit.   SUMMARY  This	chapter	introduced	the	isolation	features	provided	by Linux	and	talked	about	how	Docker	uses	those	to	build configurable	containers.	With	this	knowledge,	you	will	be	able to	customize	that	container	isolation	and	use	Docker	for	any use	case.	The	following	points	were	covered	in	this	chapter:  Docker	uses	cgroups,	which	let	a	user	set	memory	limits,	CPU	weight, limits,	and	core	restrictions	as	well	as	restrict	access	to	specific	devices.  Docker	containers	each	have	their	own	IPC	namespace	that	can	be	shared with	other	containers	or	the	host	in	order	to	facilitate	communication	over shared	memory.  Docker	supports	isolating	the	USR	namespace.	By	default,	user	and	group IDs	inside	a	container	are	equivalent	to	the	same	IDs	on	the	host	machine. When	the	user	namespace	is	enabled,	user	and	group	IDs	in	the	container are	remapped	to	IDs	that	do	not	exist	on	the	host.  You	can	and	should	use	the	-u	option	on	docker	container	run and	docker	container	create	to	run	containers	as	nonroot	users.  Avoid	running	containers	in	privileged	mode	whenever	possible.  Linux	capabilities	provide	operating	system	feature	authorization.	Docker drops	certain	capabilities	in	order	to	provide	reasonably	isolating	defaults.  The	capabilities	granted	to	any	container	can	be	set	with	the	--cap-add and	--cap-drop	flags.  Docker	provides	tooling	for	integrating	easily	with	enhanced	isolation technologies	such	as	seccomp,	SELinux,	and	AppArmor.	These	are powerful	tools	that	security-conscious	Docker	adopters	should	investigate.   Part	2.	Packaging	software	for distribution  Inevitably,	a	Docker	user	will	need	to	create	an	image. Sometimes	the	software	you	need	is	not	packaged	in	an	image. Other	times	you	will	need	a	feature	that	has	not	been	enabled in	an	available	image.	The	four	chapters	in	this	part	will	help you	understand	how	to	originate,	customize,	and	specialize	the images	you	intend	to	deploy	or	share	using	Docker.   Chapter	7.	Packaging	software	in	images  This	chapter	covers  Manual	image	construction	and	practices  Images	from	a	packaging	perspective  Working	with	flat	images  Image	versioning	best	practices  The	goal	of	this	chapter	is	to	help	you	understand	the	concerns of	image	design,	learn	the	tools	for	building	images,	and discover	advanced	image	patterns.	You	will	accomplish	these things	by	working	through	a	thorough	real-world	example. Before	getting	started,	you	should	have	a	firm	grasp	on	the concepts	in	part	1	of	this	book.  You	can	create	a	Docker	image	by	either	modifying	an existing	image	inside	a	container	or	defining	and	executing	a build	script	called	a	Dockerfile.	This	chapter	focuses	on	the process	of	manually	changing	an	image,	the	fundamental mechanics	of	image	manipulation,	and	the	artifacts	that	are produced.	Dockerfiles	and	build	automation	are	covered	in chapter	8.   7.1.	BUILDING	DOCKER	IMAGES	FROM	A	CONTAINER  It’s	easy	to	get	started	building	images	if	you’re	already familiar	with	using	containers.	Remember,	a	union	filesystem  UFS 	mount	provides	a	container’s	filesystem.	Any	changes that	you	make	to	the	filesystem	inside	a	container	will	be written	as	new	layers	owned	by	the	container	that	created them.  Before	you	work	with	real	software,	the	next	section	details the	typical	workflow	with	a	“Hello,	World”	example.  7.1.1.	Packaging	“Hello,	World”  The	basic	workflow	for	building	an	image	from	a	container includes	three	steps.	First,	you	create	a	container	from	an existing	image.	You	choose	the	image	based	on	what	you	want to	be	included	with	the	new	finished	image	and	the	tools	you need	to	make	the	changes.  The	second	step	is	to	modify	the	filesystem	of	the	container. These	changes	will	be	written	to	a	new	layer	of	the	container’s union	filesystem.	We’ll	revisit	the	relationship	between images,	layers,	and	repositories	later	in	this	chapter.  Once	the	changes	have	been	made,	the	last	step	is	to	commit those	changes.	Then	you’ll	be	able	to	create	new	containers from	the	resulting	image.	Figure	7.1	illustrates	this	workflow.  Figure	7.1.	Building	an	image	from	a	container   With	these	steps	in	mind,	work	through	the	following commands	to	create	a	new	image	named	hw_image:  docker	container	run	--name	hw_container	\ 				ubuntu:latest	\ 				touch	 HelloWorld																															1  docker	container	commit	hw_container	hw_image							2  docker	container	rm	-vf	hw_container																3  docker	container	run	--rm	\ 				hw_image	\ 				ls	-l	 HelloWorld																															4  1	Modifies	file	in	container  2	Commits	change	to	new	image  3	Removes	changed	container  4	Examines	file	in	new	container  If	that	seems	stunningly	simple,	you	should	know	that	it	does become	a	bit	more	nuanced	as	the	images	you	produce	become more	sophisticated,	but	the	basic	steps	will	always	be	the same.	Now	that	you	have	an	idea	of	the	workflow,	you	should try	to	build	a	new	image	with	real	software.	In	this	case,	you’ll   be	packaging	a	program	called	Git.  7.1.2.	Preparing	packaging	for	Git  Git	is	a	popular,	distributed	version-control	tool.	Whole	books have	been	written	about	the	topic.	If	you’re	unfamiliar	with	it, we	recommend	that	you	spend	some	time	learning	how	to	use Git.	At	the	moment,	though,	you	need	to	know	only	that	it’s	a program	you’re	going	to	install	onto	an	Ubuntu	image.  To	get	started	building	your	own	image,	the	first	thing	you’ll need	is	a	container	created	from	an	appropriate	base	image:  docker	container	run	-it	--name	image-dev	ubuntu:latest  bin bash  This	will	start	a	new	container	running	the	bash	shell.	From this	prompt,	you	can	issue	commands	to	customize	your container.	Ubuntu	ships	with	a	Linux	tool	for	software installation	called	apt-get.	This	will	come	in	handy	for acquiring	the	software	that	you	want	to	package	in	a	Docker image.	You	should	now	have	an	interactive	shell	running	with your	container.	Next,	you	need	to	install	Git	in	the	container. Do	that	by	running	the	following	commands:  apt-get	update apt-get	-y	install	git  This	will	tell	APT	to	download	and	install	Git	and	all	its dependencies	on	the	container’s	filesystem.	When	it’s finished,	you	can	test	the	installation	by	running	the	git program:   git	version 	Output	something	like: 	git	version	2.7.4  Package	tools	like	apt-get	make	installing	and	uninstalling software	easier	than	if	you	had	to	do	everything	by	hand.	But they	provide	no	isolation	to	that	software,	and	dependency conflicts	often	occur.	You	can	be	sure	that	other	software	you install	outside	this	container	won’t	impact	the	version	of	Git you	have	installed	in	this	container.  Now	that	Git	has	been	installed	on	your	Ubuntu	container,	you can	simply	exit	the	container:  exit  The	container	should	be	stopped	but	still	present	on	your computer.	Git	has	been	installed	in	a	new	layer	on	top	of	the ubuntu:latest	image.	If	you	were	to	walk	away	from	this example	right	now	and	return	a	few	days	later,	how	would	you know	exactly	what	changes	were	made?	When	you’re packaging	software,	it’s	often	useful	to	review	the	list	of	files that	have	been	modified	in	a	container,	and	Docker	has	a command	for	that.  7.1.3.	Reviewing	filesystem	changes  Docker	has	a	command	that	shows	you	all	the	filesystem changes	that	have	been	made	inside	a	container.	These changes	include	added,	changed,	or	deleted	files	and directories.	To	review	the	changes	that	you	made	when	you   used	APT	to	install	Git,	run	the	diff	subcommand:  docker	container	diff	image-dev					1  1	Outputs	a	LONG	list	of	file	changes  Lines	that	start	with	an	A	are	files	that	were	added.	Those starting	with	a	C	were	changed.	Finally,	those	with	a	D	were deleted.	Installing	Git	with	APT	in	this	way	made	several changes.	For	that	reason,	it	might	be	better	to	see	this	at	work with	a	few	specific	examples:  docker	container	run	--name	tweak-a	busybox:latest	touch	  HelloWorld			1 docker	container	diff	tweak-a 	Output: 				A	 HelloWorld  docker	container	run	--name	tweak-d	busybox:latest	rm	 bin vi										 2 docker	container	diff	tweak-d 	Output: 				C	 bin 				D	 bin vi  docker	container	run	--name	tweak-c	busybox:latest	touch	  bin vi							3 docker	container	diff	tweak-c 	Output: 				C	 bin 				C	 bin busybox  1	Adds	new	file	to	busybox  2	Removes	existing	file	from	busybox  3	Changes	existing	file	in	busybox  Always	remember	to	clean	up	your	workspace,	like	this:  docker	container	rm	-vf	tweak-a docker	container	rm	-vf	tweak-d   docker	container	rm	-vf	tweak-c  Now	that	you’ve	seen	the	changes	you’ve	made	to	the filesystem,	you’re	ready	to	commit	the	changes	to	a	new image.	As	with	most	other	things,	this	involves	a	single command	that	does	several	things.  7.1.4.	Committing	a	new	image  You	use	the	docker	container	commit	command	to create	an	image	from	a	modified	container.	It’s	a	best	practice to	use	the	-a	flag	that	signs	the	image	with	an	author	string. You	should	also	always	use	the	-m	flag,	which	sets	a	commit message.	Create	and	sign	a	new	image	that	you’ll	name ubuntu-git	from	the	image-dev	container	where	you installed	Git:  docker	container	commit	-a	"@dockerinaction"	-m	"Added	git"	\ 		image-dev	ubuntu-git 	Outputs	a	new	unique	image	identifier	like:  bbf1d5d430cdf541a72ad74dfa54f6faec41d2c1e4200778e9d4302035e5d143  Once	you’ve	committed	the	image,	it	should	show	up	in	the list	of	images	installed	on	your	computer.	Running	docker images	should	include	a	line	like	this:  REPOSITORY				TAG						IMAGE	ID						CREATED								VIRTUAL SIZE ubuntu-git				latest			bbf1d5d430cd		5	seconds	ago		248	MB  Make	sure	it	works	by	testing	Git	in	a	container	created	from that	image:   docker	container	run	--rm	ubuntu-git	git	version  Now	you’ve	created	a	new	image	based	on	an	Ubuntu	image and	installed	Git.	That’s	a	great	start,	but	what	do	you	think will	happen	if	you	omit	the	command	override?	Try	it	to	find out:  docker	container	run	--rm	ubuntu-git  Nothing	appears	to	happen	when	you	run	that	command. That’s	because	the	command	you	started	the	original	container with	was	committed	with	the	new	image.	The	command	you used	to	start	the	container	that	the	image	was	created	by	was  bin bash.	When	you	create	a	container	from	this	image	by using	the	default	command,	it	will	start	a	shell	and immediately	exit.	That’s	not	a	terribly	useful	default command.  I	doubt	that	any	users	of	an	image	named	ubuntu-git would	expect	that	they’d	need	to	manually	invoke	Git	each time.	It	would	be	better	to	set	an	entrypoint	on	the	image	to git.	An	entrypoint	is	the	program	that	will	be	executed	when the	container	starts.	If	the	entrypoint	isn’t	set,	the	default command	will	be	executed	directly.	If	the	entrypoint	is	set,	the default	command	and	its	arguments	will	be	passed	to	the entrypoint	as	arguments.  To	set	the	entrypoint,	you	need	to	create	a	new	container	with the	--entrypoint	flag	set	and	create	a	new	image	from that	container:   docker	container	run	--name	cmd-git	--entrypoint	git	ubuntu-git			 1  docker	container	commit	-m	"Set	CMD	git"	\ 				-a	"@dockerinaction"	cmd-git	ubuntu-git																							 2  docker	container	rm	-vf	cmd-git																																			 3  docker	container	run	--name	cmd-git	ubuntu-git	version												 4  1	Shows	standard	git	help	and	exit  2	Commits	new	image	to	same	name  3	Cleanup  4	Test  Now	that	the	entrypoint	has	been	set	to	git,	users	no	longer need	to	type	the	command	at	the	end.	This	might	seem	like	a marginal	savings	with	this	example,	but	many	tools	that people	use	are	not	as	succinct.	Setting	the	entrypoint	is	just one	thing	you	can	do	to	make	images	easier	for	people	to	use and	integrate	into	their	projects.  7.1.5.	Configuring	image	attributes  When	you	use	docker	container	commit,	you	commit a	new	layer	to	an	image.	The	filesystem	snapshot	isn’t	the	only thing	included	with	this	commit.	Each	layer	also	includes metadata	describing	the	execution	context.	Of	the	parameters that	can	be	set	when	a	container	is	created,	all	the	following will	carry	forward	with	an	image	created	from	the	container:  All	environment	variables  The	working	directory   The	set	of	exposed	ports  All	volume	definitions  The	container	entrypoint  Command	and	arguments  If	these	values	weren’t	specifically	set	for	the	container,	the values	will	be	inherited	from	the	original	image.	Part	1	of	this book	covers	each	of	these,	so	we	won’t	reintroduce	them	here. But	it	may	be	valuable	to	examine	two	detailed	examples. First,	consider	a	container	that	introduces	two	environment variable	specializations:  docker	container	run	--name	rich-image-example	\ 				-e	ENV_EXAMPLE1=Rich	-e	ENV_EXAMPLE2=Example	\				1 				busybox:latest  docker	container	commit	rich-image-example	rie								2  docker	container	run	--rm	rie	\ 				 bin sh	-c	"echo	\$ENV_EXAMPLE1	\$ENV_EXAMPLE2"			3  1	Creates	environment	variable	specialization  2	Commits	image  3	Outputs:	Rich	Example  Next,	consider	a	container	that	introduces	an	entrypoint	and command	specialization	as	a	new	layer	on	top	of	the	previous example:  docker	container	run	--name	rich-image-example-2	\ 				--entrypoint	" bin sh"	\																										1 				rie	\ 				-c	"echo	\$ENV_EXAMPLE1	\$ENV_EXAMPLE2"											2  docker	container	commit	rich-image-example-2	rie						3  docker	container	run	--rm	rie																									4   1	Sets	default	entrypoint  2	Sets	default	command  3	Commits	image  4	Different	command	with	same	output  This	example	builds	two	additional	layers	on	top	of	BusyBox. In	neither	case	are	files	changed,	but	the	behavior	changes because	the	context	metadata	has	been	altered.	These	changes include	two	new	environment	variables	in	the	first	new	layer. Those	environment	variables	are	clearly	inherited	by	the second	new	layer,	which	sets	the	entrypoint	and	default command	to	display	their	values.	The	last	command	uses	the final	image	without	specifying	any	alternative	behavior,	but it’s	clear	that	the	previous	defined	behavior	has	been	inherited.  Now	that	you	understand	how	to	modify	an	image,	take	the time	to	dive	deeper	into	the	mechanics	of	images	and	layers. Doing	so	will	help	you	produce	high-quality	images	in	real- world	situations.   7.2.	GOING	DEEP	ON	DOCKER	IMAGES	AND	LAYERS  By	this	point	in	the	chapter,	you’ve	built	a	few	images.	In those	examples,	you	started	by	creating	a	container	from	an image	such	as	ubuntu:latest	or	busybox:latest. Then	you	made	changes	to	the	filesystem	or	context	within that	container.	Finally,	everything	seemed	to	just	work	when you	used	the	docker	container	commit	command	to create	a	new	image.	Understanding	how	the	container’s filesystem	works	and	what	the	docker	container commit	command	actually	does	will	help	you	become	a better	image	author.	This	section	dives	into	that	subject	and demonstrates	the	impact	to	authors.  7.2.1.	Exploring	union	filesystems  Understanding	the	details	of	union	filesystems	is	important	for image	authors	for	two	reasons:  Authors	need	to	know	the	impact	that	adding,	changing,	and	deleting	files have	on	resulting	images.  Authors	need	have	a	solid	understanding	of	the	relationship	between layers	and	how	layers	relate	to	images,	repositories,	and	tags.  Start	by	considering	a	simple	example.	Suppose	you	want	to make	a	single	change	to	an	existing	image.	In	this	case,	the image	is	ubuntu:latest,	and	you	want	to	add	a	file	named mychange	to	the	root	directory.	You	should	use	the	following command	to	do	this:  docker	container	run	--name	mod_ubuntu	ubuntu:latest	touch   docker	container	run	--name	mod_ubuntu	ubuntu:latest	touch  mychange  The	resulting	container	 named	mod_ubuntu 	will	be stopped	but	will	have	written	that	single	change	to	its filesystem.	As	discussed	in	chapters	3	and	4,	the	root filesystem	is	provided	by	the	image	that	the	container	was started	from.	That	filesystem	is	implemented	with	a	union filesystem.  A	union	filesystem	is	made	up	of	layers.	Each	time	a	change	is made	to	a	union	filesystem,	that	change	is	recorded	on	a	new layer	on	top	of	all	of	the	others.	The	union	of	all	of	those layers,	or	top-down	view,	is	what	the	container	 and	user 	sees when	accessing	the	filesystem.	Figure	7.2	illustrates	the	two perspectives	for	this	example.  Figure	7.2.	A	simple	file	write	example	on	a	union	filesystem	from	two	perspectives   When	you	read	a	file	from	a	union	filesystem,	that	file	will	be read	from	the	topmost	layer	where	it	exists.	If	a	file	was	not created	or	changed	on	the	top	layer,	the	read	will	fall	through the	layers	until	it	reaches	a	layer	where	that	file	does	exist. This	is	illustrated	in	figure	7.3.  Figure	7.3.	Reading	files	that	are	located	on	different	layers   All	this	layer	functionality	is	hidden	by	the	union	filesystem. No	special	actions	need	to	be	taken	by	the	software	running	in a	container	to	take	advantage	of	these	features.	Understanding layers	where	files	were	added	covers	one	of	three	types	of filesystem	writes.	The	other	two	are	deletions	and	file	changes.  Like	additions,	both	file	changes	and	deletions	work	by modifying	the	top	layer.	When	a	file	is	deleted,	a	delete	record is	written	to	the	top	layer,	which	hides	any	versions	of	that	file on	lower	layers.	When	a	file	is	changed,	that	change	is	written to	the	top	layer,	which	again	hides	any	versions	of	that	file	on lower	layers.	The	changes	made	to	the	filesystem	of	a container	are	listed	with	the	docker	container	diff command	you	used	earlier	in	the	chapter:  docker	container	diff	mod_ubuntu   This	command	will	produce	the	output:  A	 mychange  The	A	in	this	case	indicates	that	the	file	was	added.	Run	the next	two	commands	to	see	how	a	file	deletion	is	recorded:  docker	container	run	--name	mod_busybox_delete	busybox:latest rm	 etc passwd docker	container	diff	mod_busybox_delete  This	time,	the	output	will	have	two	rows:  C	 etc D	 etc passwd  The	D	indicates	a	deletion,	but	this	time	the	parent	folder	of the	file	is	also	included.	The	C	indicates	that	it	was	changed. The	next	two	commands	demonstrate	a	file	change:  docker	container	run	--name	mod_busybox_change	busybox:latest touch	\ 					 etc passwd docker	container	diff	mod_busybox_change  The	diff	subcommand	will	show	two	changes:  C	 etc C	 etc passwd  Again,	the	C	indicates	a	change,	and	the	two	items	are	the	file and	the	folder	where	it’s	located.	If	a	file	nested	five	levels deep	were	changed,	there	would	be	a	line	for	each	level	of	the   tree.  Changes	to	filesystem	attributes	such	as	file	ownership	and permissions	are	recorded	in	the	same	way	as	changes	to	files. Be	careful	when	modifying	filesystem	attributes	on	large numbers	of	files,	as	those	files	will	likely	be	copied	into	the layer	performing	the	change.	File-change	mechanics	are	the most	important	thing	to	understand	about	union	filesystems, and	we	will	examine	that	a	little	deeper	next.  Most	union	filesystems	use	something	called	copy-on-write, which	is	easier	to	understand	if	you	think	of	it	as	copy-on- change.	When	a	file	in	a	read-only	layer	 not	the	top	layer 	is modified,	the	whole	file	is	first	copied	from	the	read-only layer	into	the	writable	layer	before	the	change	is	made.	This has	a	negative	impact	on	runtime	performance	and	image	size. Section	7.2.3	covers	the	way	this	should	influence	your	image design.  Take	a	moment	to	solidify	your	understanding	of	the	system by	examining	how	the	more	comprehensive	set	of	scenarios	is illustrated	in	figure	7.4.	In	this	illustration,	files	are	added, changed,	deleted,	and	added	again	over	a	range	of	three	layers.  Figure	7.4.	Various	file	addition,	change,	and	deletion	combinations	over	a	three-layered	image   Knowing	how	filesystem	changes	are	recorded,	you	can	begin to	understand	what	happens	when	you	use	the	docker container	commit	command	to	create	a	new	image.  7.2.2.	Reintroducing	images,	layers,	repositories,	and tags  You’ve	created	an	image	by	using	the	docker	container commit	command,	and	you	understand	that	it	commits	the top-layer	changes	to	an	image.	But	we’ve	yet	to	define commit.  Remember,	a	union	filesystem	is	made	up	of	a	stack	of	layers, and	new	layers	are	added	to	the	top	of	the	stack.	Those	layers are	stored	separately	as	collections	of	the	changes	made	in	that layer	and	metadata	for	that	layer.	When	you	commit	a container’s	changes	to	its	filesystem,	you’re	saving	a	copy	of that	top	layer	in	an	identifiable	way.  When	you	commit	the	layer,	a	new	ID	is	generated	for	it,	and   copies	of	all	the	file	changes	are	saved.	Exactly	how	this happens	depends	on	the	storage	engine	that’s	being	used	on your	system.	It’s	less	important	for	you	to	understand	the details	than	it	is	for	you	to	understand	the	general	approach. The	metadata	for	a	layer	includes	that	generated	identifier,	the identifier	of	the	layer	below	it	 parent ,	and	the	execution context	of	the	container	that	the	layer	was	created	from.	Layer identities	and	metadata	form	the	graph	that	Docker	and	the UFS	use	to	construct	images.  An	image	is	the	stack	of	layers	that	you	get	by	starting	with	a given	top	layer	and	then	following	all	the	links	defined	by	the parent	ID	in	each	layer’s	metadata,	as	shown	in	figure	7.5.  Figure	7.5.	An	image	is	the	collection	of	layers	produced	by	traversing	the	parent	graph	from	a top	layer.  Images	are	stacks	of	layers	constructed	by	traversing	the	layer dependency	graph	from	a	starting	layer.	The	layer	that	the   traversal	starts	from	is	the	top	of	the	stack.	This	means	that	a layer’s	ID	is	also	the	ID	of	the	image	that	it	and	its dependencies	form.	Take	a	moment	to	see	this	in	action	by committing	the	mod_ubuntu	container	you	created	earlier:  docker	container	commit	mod_ubuntu  That	commit	subcommand	will	generate	output	that	includes a	new	image	ID	like	this:  6528255cda2f9774a11a6b82be46c86a66b5feff913f5bb3e09536a54b08234d  You	can	create	a	new	container	from	this	image	by	using	the image	ID	as	it’s	presented	to	you.	Like	containers,	layer	IDs are	large	hexadecimal	numbers	that	can	be	difficult	for	a person	to	work	with	directly.	For	that	reason,	Docker	provides repositories.  In	chapter	3,	a	repository	is	roughly	defined	as	a	named	bucket of	images.	More	specifically,	repositories	are	location name pairs	that	point	to	a	set	of	specific	layer	identifiers.	Each repository	contains	at	least	one	tag	that	points	to	a	specific layer	identifier	and	thus	the	image	definition.	Let’s	revisit	the example	used	in	chapter	3:   This	repository	is	located	in	the	Docker	Hub	registry,	but	we have	used	the	fully	qualified	registry	hostname,	docker.io. It’s	named	for	the	user	 dockerinaction 	and	a	unique short	name	 ch3_hello_registry .	If	you	pull	this repository	without	specifying	a	tag,	Docker	will	try	to	pull	an image	tagged	with	latest.	You	can	pull	all	tagged	images	in a	repository	by	adding	the	--all-tags	option	to	your	pull command.	In	this	example,	there’s	only	one	tag:	latest. That	tag	points	to	a	layer	with	the	short	form	ID 4203899414c0,	as	illustrated	in	figure	7.6.  Figure	7.6.	A	visual	representation	of	repositories   Repositories	and	tags	are	created	with	the	docker	tag, docker	container	commit,	or	docker	build commands.	Revisit	the	mod_ubuntu	container	again	and	put it	into	a	repository	with	a	tag:  docker	container	commit	mod_ubuntu	myuser myfirstrepo:mytag 	Outputs:  82ec7d2c57952bf57ab1ffdf40d5374c4c68228e3e923633734e68a11f9a2b59  The	generated	ID	that’s	displayed	will	be	different	because another	copy	of	the	layer	was	created.	With	this	new	friendly name,	creating	containers	from	your	images	requires	little effort.	If	you	want	to	copy	an	image,	you	need	only	to	create	a   new	tag	or	repository	from	the	existing	one.	You	can	do	that with	the	docker	tag	command.	Every	repository	contains	a latest	tag	by	default.	That	will	be	used	if	the	tag	is	omitted, as	in	the	previous	command:  docker	tag	myuser myfirstrepo:mytag	myuser mod_ubuntu  By	this	point,	you	should	have	a	strong	understanding	of	basic UFS	fundamentals	as	well	as	how	Docker	creates	and	manages layers,	images,	and	repositories.	With	these	in	mind,	let’s consider	how	they	might	impact	image	design.  All	layers	below	the	writable	layer	created	for	a	container	are immutable,	meaning	they	can	never	be	modified.	This property	makes	it	possible	to	share	access	to	images	instead	of creating	independent	copies	for	every	container.	It	also	makes individual	layers	highly	reusable.	The	other	side	of	this property	is	that	any	time	you	make	changes	to	an	image,	you need	to	add	a	new	layer,	and	old	layers	are	never	removed. Knowing	that	images	will	inevitably	need	to	change,	you	need to	be	aware	of	any	image	limitations	and	keep	in	mind	how changes	impact	image	size.  7.2.3.	Managing	image	size	and	layer	limits  If	images	evolved	in	the	same	way	that	most	people	manage their	filesystems,	Docker	images	would	quickly	become unusable.	For	example,	suppose	you	want	to	make	a	different version	of	the	ubuntu-git	image	you	created	earlier	in	this chapter.	It	may	seem	natural	to	modify	that	ubuntu-git image.	Before	you	do,	create	a	new	tag	for	your	ubuntu-   git	image.	You’ll	be	reassigning	the	latest	tag:  docker	image	tag	ubuntu-git:latest	ubuntu-git:2.7							1  1	Creates	new	tag:	2.7  The	first	thing	you’ll	do	in	building	your	new	image	is	remove the	version	of	Git	you	installed:  docker	container	run	--name	image-dev2	\ 								--entrypoint	 bin bash	\																								1 				ubuntu-git:latest	-c	"apt-get	remove	-y	git"								2  docker	container	commit	image-dev2	ubuntu-git:removed			3  docker	image	tag	ubuntu-git:removed	ubuntu-git:latest			4  docker	image	ls																																									5  1	Executes	bash	command  2	Removes	Git  3	Commits	image  4	Reassigns	latest	tag  5	Examines	image	sizes  The	image	list	and	sizes	reported	will	look	something	like	the following:  REPOSITORY			TAG								IMAGE	ID								CREATED VIRTUAL	SIZE ubuntu-git			latest					826c66145a59				10	seconds	ago				226.6 MB ubuntu-git			removed				826c66145a59				10	seconds	ago				226.6 MB ubuntu-git			2.7								3e356394c14e				41	hours	ago						226 MB ...   Notice	that	even	though	you	removed	Git,	the	image	actually increased	in	size.	Although	you	could	examine	the	specific changes	with	docker	container	diff,	you	should	be quick	to	realize	that	the	reason	for	the	increase	has	to	do	with the	union	filesystem.  Remember,	UFS	will	mark	a	file	as	deleted	by	actually	adding a	file	to	the	top	layer.	The	original	file	and	any	copies	that existed	in	other	layers	will	still	be	present	in	the	image.	It’s important	to	minimize	image	size	for	the	sake	of	the	people and	systems	that	will	be	consuming	your	images.	If	you	can avoid	causing	long	download	times	and	significant	disk	usage with	smart	image	creation,	your	consumers	will	benefit.	In	the early	days	of	Docker,	image	authors	sometimes	minimized	the number	of	layers	in	an	image	because	of	the	limits	of	image storage	drivers.	Modern	Docker	image	storage	drivers	do	not have	image	layer	limits	that	normal	users	will	encounter,	so design	for	other	attributes	such	as	size	and	cacheability.  You	can	examine	all	the	layers	in	an	image	by	using	the docker	image	history	command.	It	will	display	the following:  Abbreviated	layer	ID  Age	of	the	layer  Initial	command	of	the	creating	container  Total	file	size	of	that	layer  By	examining	the	history	of	the	ubuntu-git:removed image,	you	can	see	that	three	layers	have	already	been	added on	the	top	of	the	original	ubuntu:latest	image:   docker	image	history	ubuntu-git:removed  Outputs	are	something	like	this:  IMAGE										CREATED										CREATED	BY SIZE 826c66145a59			24	minutes	ago			 bin bash	-c	apt-get	remove 662	kB 3e356394c14e			42	hours	ago					git																											0 B bbf1d5d430cd			42	hours	ago					 bin bash 37.68	MB b39b81afc8ca			3	months	ago					 bin sh	-c	 nop 	CMD	[ bin			0 B 615c102e2290			3	months	ago					 bin sh	-c	sed	-i	's ^\s*\ 1.895	kB 837339b91538			3	months	ago					 bin sh	-c	echo	'! bin sh' 194.5	kB 53f858aaaf03			3	months	ago					 bin sh	-c	 nop 	ADD	file: 188.1	MB 511136ea3c5a			22	months	ago																																		0 B  You	can	flatten	images	by	saving	the	image	to	a	TAR	file	with docker	image	save,	and	then	importing	the	contents	of that	filesystem	back	into	Docker	with	docker	image import.	But	that’s	a	bad	idea,	because	you	lose	the	original image’s	metadata,	its	change	history,	and	any	savings customers	might	get	when	they	download	images	with	the same	lower	levels.	The	smarter	thing	to	do	in	this	case	is	to create	a	branch.  Instead	of	fighting	the	layer	system,	you	can	solve	both	the size	and	layer	growth	problems	by	using	the	layer	system	to create	branches.	The	layer	system	makes	it	trivial	to	go	back	in the	history	of	an	image	and	make	a	new	branch.	You	are potentially	creating	a	new	branch	every	time	you	create	a   container	from	the	same	image.  In	reconsidering	your	strategy	for	your	new	ubuntu-git image,	you	should	simply	start	from	ubuntu:latest	again. With	a	fresh	container	from	ubuntu:latest,	you	could install	whatever	version	of	Git	you	want.	The	result	would	be that	both	the	original	ubuntu-git	image	you	created	and the	new	one	would	share	the	same	parent,	and	the	new	image wouldn’t	have	any	of	the	baggage	of	unrelated	changes.  Branching	increases	the	likelihood	that	you’ll	need	to	repeat steps	that	were	accomplished	in	peer	branches.	Doing	that work	by	hand	is	prone	to	error.	Automating	image	builds	with Dockerfiles	is	a	better	idea.  Occasionally,	the	need	arises	to	build	a	full	image	from scratch.	Docker	provides	special	handling	for	the	scratch image	that	tells	the	build	process	to	make	the	next	command the	first	layer	of	the	resulting	image.	This	practice	can	be beneficial	if	your	goal	is	to	keep	images	small	and	if	you’re working	with	technologies	that	have	few	dependencies	such	as the	Go	or	Rust	programming	languages.	Other	times,	you	may want	to	flatten	an	image	to	trim	an	image’s	history.	In	either case,	you	need	a	way	to	import	and	export	full	filesystems.   7.3.	EXPORTING	AND	IMPORTING	FLAT	FILESYSTEMS  On	some	occasions,	it’s	advantageous	to	build	images	by working	with	the	files	destined	for	an	image	outside	the context	of	the	union	filesystem	or	a	container.	To	fill	this	need, Docker	provides	two	commands	for	exporting	and	importing archives	of	files.  The	docker	container	export	command	will	stream the	full	contents	of	the	flattened	union	filesystem	to	stdout	or an	output	file	as	a	tarball.	The	result	is	a	tarball	that	contains all	the	files	from	the	container	perspective.	This	can	be	useful if	you	need	to	use	the	filesystem	that	was	shipped	with	an image	outside	the	context	of	a	container.	You	can	use	the docker	cp	command	for	this	purpose,	but	if	you	need several	files,	exporting	the	full	filesystem	may	be	more	direct.  Create	a	new	container	and	use	the	export	subcommand	to get	a	flattened	copy	of	its	filesystem:  docker	container	create	--name	export-test	\ 			dockerinaction ch7_packed:latest	. echo	For	Export							1  docker	container	export	--output	contents.tar	export-test  docker	container	rm	export-test  tar	-tf	contents.tar																																								2  1	Exports	filesystem	contents  2	Shows	archive	contents   This	will	produce	a	file	in	the	current	directory	named contents.tar.	That	file	should	contain	two	files	from	the ch7_packed	image:	message.txt	and	folder message.txt.	At this	point,	you	could	extract,	examine,	or	change	those	files	to whatever	end.	The	archive	will	also	contain	some	zero-byte files	related	to	devices	and	files	that	Docker	manages	for	every container	such	as	 etc resolv.conf.	You	can	ignore	these.	If	you had	omitted	the	--output	 or	-o	for	short ,	then	the contents	of	the	filesystem	would	be	streamed	in	tarball	format to	stdout.	Streaming	the	contents	to	stdout	makes	the	export command	useful	for	chaining	with	other	shell	programs	that work	with	tarballs.  The	docker	import	command	will	stream	the	content	of	a tarball	into	a	new	image.	The	import	command	recognizes several	compressed	and	uncompressed	forms	of	tarballs.	An optional	Dockerfile	instruction	can	also	be	applied	during filesystem	import.	Importing	filesystems	is	a	simple	way	to	get a	complete	minimum	set	of	files	into	an	image.  To	see	how	useful	this	is,	consider	a	statically	linked	Go version	of	“Hello,	World.”	Create	an	empty	folder	and	copy the	following	code	into	a	new	file	named	helloworld.go:  package	main import	"fmt" func	main  	{ 								fmt.Println "hello,	world!"  }  You	may	not	have	Go	installed	on	your	computer,	but	that’s no	problem	for	a	Docker	user.	By	running	the	next	command,   Docker	will	pull	an	image	containing	the	Go	compiler, compile	and	statically	link	the	code	 which	means	it	can	run all	by	itself ,	and	place	that	program	back	into	your	folder:  docker	container	run	--rm	-v	"$ pwd ": usr src hello	\ 				-w	 usr src hello	golang:1.9	go	build	-v  If	everything	works	correctly,	you	should	have	an	executable program	 binary	file 	in	the	same	folder,	named	hello. Statically	linked	programs	have	no	external	file	dependencies at	runtime.	That	means	this	statically	linked	version	of	“Hello, World”	can	run	in	a	container	with	no	other	files.	The	next step	is	to	put	that	program	in	a	tarball:  tar	-cf	static_hello.tar	hello  Now	that	the	program	has	been	packaged	in	a	tarball,	you	can import	it	by	using	the	docker	import	command:  docker	import	-c	"ENTRYPOINT	[\" hello\"]"	-	\ 				dockerinaction ch7_static	<	static_hello.tar					1  1	Tar	file	streamed	via	UNIX	pipe  In	this	command,	you	use	the	-c	flag	to	specify	a	Dockerfile command.	The	command	you	use	sets	the	entrypoint	for	the new	image.	The	exact	syntax	of	the	Dockerfile	command	is covered	in	chapter	8.	The	more	interesting	argument	on	this command	is	the	hyphen	 - at	the	end	of	the	first	line.	This hyphen	indicates	that	the	contents	of	the	tarball	will	be streamed	through	stdin.	You	can	specify	a	URL	at	this	position if	you’re	fetching	the	file	from	a	remote	web	server	instead	of   from	your	local	filesystem.  You	tagged	the	resulting	image	as	the dockerinaction ch7_static	repository.	Take	a moment	to	explore	the	results:  docker	container	run	dockerinaction ch7_static					1 docker	history	dockerinaction ch7_static  1	Outputs:	hello,	world!  You’ll	notice	that	the	history	for	this	image	has	only	a	single entry	 and	layer :  IMAGE											CREATED									CREATED	BY					SIZE edafbd4a0ac5				11	minutes	ago																	1.824	MB  In	this	case,	the	image	you	produced	was	small	for	two reasons.	First,	the	program	you	produced	was	only	just	over 1.8	MB,	and	you	included	no	operating	system	files	or	support programs.	This	is	a	minimalistic	image.	Second,	there’s	only one	layer.	There	are	no	deleted	or	unused	files	carried	with	the image	in	lower	layers.	The	downside	to	using	single-layer	 or flat 	images	is	that	your	system	won’t	benefit	from	layer	reuse. That	might	not	be	a	problem	if	all	your	images	are	small enough.	But	the	overhead	may	be	significant	if	you	use	larger stacks	or	languages	that	don’t	offer	static	linking.  There	are	trade-offs	to	every	image	design	decision,	including whether	or	not	to	use	flat	images.	Regardless	of	the mechanism	you	use	to	build	images,	your	users	need	a consistent	and	predictable	way	to	identify	different	versions.   7.4.	VERSIONING	BEST	PRACTICES  Pragmatic	versioning	practices	help	users	make	the	best	use	of images.	The	goal	of	an	effective	versioning	scheme	is	to communicate	clearly	and	provide	flexibility	to	image	users.  It’s	generally	insufficient	to	build	or	maintain	only	a	single version	of	your	software	unless	it’s	your	first.	If	you’re releasing	the	first	version	of	your	software,	you	should	be mindful	of	your	users’	adoption	experience	from	the beginning.	Versions	are	important	because	they	identify contracts	your	adopters	depend	on.	Unexpected	software changes	cause	problems	for	adopters,	and	versions	are	one	of the	primary	ways	to	signal	software	changes.  With	Docker,	the	key	to	maintaining	multiple	versions	of	the same	software	is	proper	repository	tagging.	The	understanding that	every	repository	contains	multiple	tags	and	that	multiple tags	can	reference	the	same	image	is	at	the	core	of	a	pragmatic tagging	scheme.  The	docker	image	tag	command	is	unlike	the	other	two commands	that	can	be	used	to	create	tags.	It’s	the	only	one that’s	applied	to	existing	images.	To	understand	how	to	use tags	and	how	they	impact	the	user	adoption	experience, consider	the	two	tagging	schemes	for	a	repository	shown	in figure	7.7.  Figure	7.7.	Two	tagging	schemes	 left	and	right 	for	the	same	repository	with	three	images. Dotted	lines	represent	old	relationships	between	a	tag	and	an	image.   There	are	two	problems	with	the	tagging	scheme	on	the	left side	of	figure	7.7.	First,	it	provides	poor	adoption	flexibility.	A user	can	choose	to	declare	a	dependency	on	1.9	or	latest. When	a	user	adopts	version	1.9	and	that	implementation	is actually	1.9.1,	they	may	develop	dependencies	on	behavior defined	by	that	build	version.	Without	a	way	to	explicitly depend	on	that	build	version,	they	will	experience	pain	when 1.9	is	updated	to	point	to	1.9.2.  The	best	way	to	eliminate	this	problem	is	to	define	and	tag versions	at	a	level	where	users	can	depend	on	consistent contracts.	This	is	not	advocating	a	three-tiered	versioning system.	It	means	only	that	the	smallest	unit	of	the	versioning system	you	use	captures	the	smallest	unit	of	contract	iteration. By	providing	multiple	tags	at	this	level,	you	can	let	users decide	how	much	version	drift	they	want	to	accept.  Consider	the	right	side	of	figure	7.7.	A	user	who	adopts version	1	will	always	use	the	highest	minor	and	build	version under	that	major	version.	Adopting	1.9	will	always	use	the highest	build	version	for	that	minor	version.	Adopters	who   need	to	carefully	migrate	between	versions	of	their dependencies	can	do	so	with	control	and	at	times	of	their choosing.  The	second	problem	is	related	to	the	latest	tag.	On	the	left, latest	currently	points	to	an	image	that’s	not	otherwise tagged,	so	an	adopter	has	no	way	of	knowing	what	version	of the	software	that	is.	In	this	case,	it’s	referring	to	a	release candidate	for	the	next	major	version	of	the	software.	An unsuspecting	user	may	adopt	the	latest	tag	with	the impression	that	it’s	referring	to	the	latest	build	of	an	otherwise tagged	version.  The	latest	tag	has	other	problems.	It’s	adopted	more frequently	than	it	should	be.	This	happens	because	it’s	the default	tag.	The	impact	is	that	a	responsible	repository maintainer	should	always	make	sure	that	its	repository’s latest	refers	to	the	latest	stable	build	of	its	software	instead of	the	true	latest.  The	last	thing	to	keep	in	mind	is	that	in	the	context	of containers,	you’re	versioning	not	only	your	software	but	also	a snapshot	of	all	of	your	software’s	packaged	dependencies.	For example,	if	you	package	software	with	a	particular	distribution of	Linux,	such	as	Debian,	then	those	additional	packages become	part	of	your	image’s	interface	contract.	Your	users will	build	tooling	around	your	images	and	in	some	cases	may come	to	depend	on	the	presence	of	a	particular	shell	or	script in	your	image.	If	you	suddenly	rebase	your	software	on something	like	CentOS	but	leave	your	software	otherwise unchanged,	your	users	will	experience	pain.   When	software	dependencies	change,	or	the	software	needs	to be	distributed	on	top	of	multiple	bases,	then	those dependencies	should	be	included	with	your	tagging	scheme.  The	Docker	official	repositories	are	ideal	examples	to	follow. Consider	this	abbreviated	tag	list	for	the	official	golang repository,	where	each	row	represents	a	distinct	image:  1.9,													1.9-stretch,	1.9.6 1.9-alpine 1,															1.10,								1.10.2,										latest, stretch 1.10-alpine,					alpine  Users	can	determine	that	the	latest	version	of	Golang	1,	1.x, and	1.10	all	currently	point	to	version	1.10.2.	A	Golang	user can	select	a	tag	that	meets	their	needs	for	tracking	changes	in Golang	or	the	base	operating	system.	If	an	adopter	needs	the latest	image	built	on	the	debian:stretch	platform,	they can	use	the	stretch	tag.	This	scheme	puts	the	control	and responsibility	for	upgrades	in	the	hands	of	your	adopters.   SUMMARY  This	is	the	first	chapter	to	cover	the	creation	of	Docker images,	tag	management,	and	other	distribution	concerns	such as	image	size.	Learning	this	material	will	help	you	build images	and	become	a	better	consumer	of	images.	The following	are	the	key	points	in	the	chapter:  New	images	are	created	when	changes	to	a	container	are	committed	using the	docker	container	commit	command.  When	a	container	is	committed,	the	configuration	it	was	started	with	will be	encoded	into	the	configuration	for	the	resulting	image.  An	image	is	a	stack	of	layers	that’s	identified	by	its	top	layer.  An	image’s	size	on	disk	is	the	sum	of	the	sizes	of	its	component	layers.  Images	can	be	exported	to	and	imported	from	a	flat	tarball	representation by	using	the	docker	container	export	and	docker	image import	commands.  The	docker	image	tag	command	can	be	used	to	assign	several	tags to	a	single	repository.  Repository	maintainers	should	keep	pragmatic	tags	to	ease	user	adoption and	migration	control.  Tag	your	latest	stable	build	with	the	latest	tag.  Provide	fine-grained	and	overlapping	tags	so	that	adopters	have	control	of the	scope	of	their	dependency	version	creep.   Chapter	8.	Building	images automatically	with	Dockerfiles  This	chapter	covers  Automated	image	packaging	with	Dockerfiles  Metadata	and	filesystem	instructions  Creating	maintainable	image	builds	with	arguments	and	multiple	stages  Packaging	for	multiprocess	and	durable	containers  Reducing	the	image	attack	surface	and	building	trust  A	Dockerfile	is	a	text	file	that	contains	instructions	for building	an	image.	The	Docker	image	builder	executes	the Dockerfile	from	top	to	bottom,	and	the	instructions	can configure	or	change	anything	about	an	image.	Building	images from	Dockerfiles	makes	tasks	like	adding	files	to	a	container from	your	computer	simple	one-line	instructions.	Dockerfiles are	the	most	common	way	to	describe	how	to	build	a	Docker image.  This	chapter	covers	the	basics	of	working	with	Dockerfile builds	and	the	best	reasons	to	use	them,	a	lean	overview	of	the instructions,	and	how	to	add	future	build	behavior.	We’ll	get started	with	a	familiar	example	that	shows	how	to	automate the	process	of	building	images	with	code	instead	of	creating them	manually.	Once	an	image’s	build	is	defined	in	code,	it	is simple	to	track	changes	in	version	control,	share	with	team members,	optimize,	and	secure.   8.1.	PACKAGING	GIT	WITH	A	DOCKERFILE  Let’s	start	by	revisiting	the	Git	example	image	we	built	by hand	in	chapter	7.	You	should	recognize	many	of	the	details and	advantages	of	working	with	a	Dockerfile	as	we	translate the	image	build	process	from	manual	operations	to	code.  First,	create	a	new	directory,	and	from	that	directory	create	a new	file	with	your	favorite	text	editor.	Name	the	new	file Dockerfile.	Write	the	following	five	lines	and	then	save	the file:  	An	example	Dockerfile	for	installing	Git	on	Ubuntu FROM	ubuntu:latest LABEL	maintainer="dia@allingeek.com" RUN	apt-get	update	&&	apt-get	install	-y	git ENTRYPOINT	["git"]  Before	dissecting	this	example,	build	a	new	image	from	it	with the	docker	image	build	command	from	the	same directory	containing	the	Dockerfile	and	tag	the	image	with auto:  docker	image	build	--tag	ubuntu-git:auto	.  This	outputs	several	lines	about	steps	and	output	from	apt- get,	and	will	finally	display	a	message	like	this:  Successfully	built	cc63aeb7a5a2 Successfully	tagged	ubuntu-git:auto   Running	this	command	starts	the	build	process.	When	it’s completed,	you	should	have	a	brand-new	image	that	you	can test.	View	the	list	of	all	your	ubuntu-git	images	and	test the	newest	one	with	this	command:  docker	image	ls  The	new	build	tagged	auto	should	now	appear	in	the	list:  REPOSITORY			TAG								IMAGE	ID								CREATED VIRTUAL	SIZE ubuntu-git			auto							cc63aeb7a5a2					2	minutes	ago 219MB ubuntu-git			latest					826c66145a59				10	minutes	ago 249MB ubuntu-git			removed				826c66145a59				10	minutes	ago 249MB ubuntu-git			1.9								3e356394c14e				41	hours	ago 249MB ...  Now	you	can	run	a	Git	command	using	the	new	image:  docker	container	run	--rm	ubuntu-git:auto  These	commands	demonstrate	that	the	image	you	built	with the	Dockerfile	works	and	is	functionally	equivalent	to	the	one you	built	by	hand.	Examine	what	you	did	to	accomplish	this:  First,	you	created	a	Dockerfile	with	four	instructions:  FROM	ubuntu:latest—	Tells	Docker	to	start	from	the	latest	Ubuntu image	just	as	you	did	when	creating	the	image	manually.  LABEL	maintainer—	Sets	the	maintainer	name	and	email	for	the image.	Providing	this	information	helps	people	know	whom	to	contact	if there’s	a	problem	with	the	image.	This	was	accomplished	earlier	when	you   invoked	commit.  RUN	apt-get	update	&&	apt-get	install	-y	git—	Tells the	builder	to	run	the	provided	commands	to	install	Git.  ENTRYPOINT	["git"]—	Sets	the	entrypoint	for	the	image	to	git.  Dockerfiles,	like	most	scripts,	can	include	comments.	Any	line beginning	with	a		will	be	ignored	by	the	builder.	It’s important	for	Dockerfiles	of	any	complexity	to	be	well- documented.	In	addition	to	improving	Dockerfile maintainability,	comments	help	people	audit	images	that they’re	considering	for	adoption	and	spread	best	practices.  The	only	special	rule	about	Dockerfiles	is	that	the	first instruction	must	be	FROM.	If	you’re	starting	from	an	empty image	and	your	software	has	no	dependencies,	or	you’ll provide	all	the	dependencies,	then	you	can	start	from	a	special empty	repository	named	scratch.  After	you	saved	the	Dockerfile,	you	started	the	build	process by	invoking	the	docker	image	build	command.	The command	had	one	flag	set	and	one	argument.	The	--tag	flag  or	-t	for	short 	specifies	the	full	repository	designation	that you	want	to	use	for	the	resulting	image.	In	this	case,	you	used ubuntu-git:auto.	The	argument	that	you	included	at	the end	was	a	single	period.	That	argument	told	the	builder	the location	of	the	Dockerfile.	The	period	told	it	to	look	for	the file	in	the	current	directory.  The	docker	image	build	command	has	another	flag,	-- file	 or	-f	for	short ,	that	lets	you	set	the	name	of	the Dockerfile.	Dockerfile	is	the	default,	but	with	this	flag	you   could	tell	the	builder	to	look	for	a	file	named	BuildScript	or release-image.df.	This	flag	sets	only	the	name	of	the	file,	not the	location.	That	must	always	be	specified	in	the	location argument.  The	builder	works	by	automating	the	same	tasks	that	you’d use	to	create	images	by	hand.	Each	instruction	triggers	the creation	of	a	new	container	with	the	specified	modification. After	the	modification	has	been	made,	the	builder	commits	the layer	and	moves	on	to	the	next	instruction	and	container created	from	the	fresh	layer.  The	builder	validated	that	the	image	specified	by	the	FROM instruction	was	installed	as	the	first	step	of	the	build.	If	it	were not,	Docker	would	have	automatically	tried	to	pull	the	image. Take	a	look	at	the	output	from	the	build	command	that	you ran:  Sending	build	context	to	Docker	daemon		2.048kB Step	1 4	:	FROM	ubuntu:latest 	--->	452a96d81c30  You	can	see	that	in	this	case	the	base	image	specified	by	the FROM	instruction	is	ubuntu:latest,	which	should	have already	been	installed	on	your	machine.	The	abbreviated image	ID	of	the	base	image	is	included	in	the	output.  The	next	instruction	sets	the	maintainer	information	on	the image.	This	creates	a	new	container	and	then	commits	the resulting	layer.	You	can	see	the	result	of	this	operation	in	the output	for	step	1:   Step	2 4	:	LABEL	maintainer="dia@allingeek.com" 	--->	Running	in	11140b391074 Removing	intermediate	container	11140b391074  The	output	includes	the	ID	of	the	container	that	was	created and	the	ID	of	the	committed	layer.	That	layer	will	be	used	as the	top	of	the	image	for	the	next	instruction,	RUN.	The	RUN instruction	executes	the	program	with	the	arguments	you specify	on	top	of	a	new	image	layer.	Then	Docker	commits	the filesystem	changes	to	the	layer	so	they	are	available	for	the next	Dockerfile	instruction.	In	this	case,	the	output	for	the	RUN instruction	was	clouded	with	all	the	output	for	the	command apt-get	update	&&	apt-get	install	-y	git. Installing	software	packages	is	one	of	the	most	common	use cases	for	the	RUN	instruction.	You	should	explicitly	install each	software	package	needed	by	your	container	to	ensure	that it	is	available	when	needed.  If	you’re	not	interested	in	reams	of	build	process	output,	you can	invoke	the	docker	image	build	command	with	the --quiet	or	-q	flag.	Running	in	quiet	mode	will	suppress	all output	from	the	build	process	and	management	of	intermediate containers.	The	only	output	of	the	build	process	in	quiet	mode is	the	resulting	image	ID,	which	looks	like	this:  sha256:e397ecfd576c83a1e49875477dcac50071e1c71f76f1d0c8d371ac74d97bbc90  Although	this	third	step	to	install	Git	usually	takes	much longer	to	complete,	you	can	see	the	instruction	and	input	as well	as	the	ID	of	the	container	where	the	command	was	run and	the	ID	of	the	resulting	layer.	Finally,	the	ENTRYPOINT   instruction	performs	all	the	same	steps,	and	the	output	is similarly	unsurprising:  Step	4 4	:	ENTRYPOINT	["git"] 	--->	Running	in	6151803c388a Removing	intermediate	container	6151803c388a 	--->	e397ecfd576c Successfully	built	e397ecfd576c Successfully	tagged	ubuntu-git:auto  A	new	layer	is	being	added	to	the	resulting	image	after	each step	in	the	build.	Although	this	means	you	could	potentially branch	on	any	of	these	steps,	the	more	important	implication	is that	the	builder	can	aggressively	cache	the	results	of	each	step. If	a	problem	with	the	build	script	occurs	after	several	other steps,	the	builder	can	restart	from	the	same	position	after	the problem	has	been	fixed.	You	can	see	this	in	action	by	breaking your	Dockerfile.  Add	this	line	to	the	end	of	your	Dockerfile:  RUN	This	will	not	work  Then	run	the	build	again:  docker	image	build	--tag	ubuntu-git:auto	.  The	output	will	show	which	steps	the	builder	was	able	to	skip in	favor	of	cached	results:  Sending	build	context	to	Docker	daemon		2.048kB Step	1 5	:	FROM	ubuntu:latest 	--->	452a96d81c30 Step	2 5	:	LABEL	maintainer="dia@allingeek.com" 	--->	Using	cache																																								1   	--->	83da14c85b5a Step	3 5	:	RUN	apt-get	update	&&	apt-get	install	-y	git 	--->	Using	cache																																								1 	--->	795a6e5d560d Step	4 5	:	ENTRYPOINT	["git"] 	--->	Using	cache																																								1 	--->	89da8ffa57c7 Step	5 5	:	RUN	This	will	not	work 	--->	Running	in	2104ec7bc170  bin sh:	1:	This:	not	found The	command	' bin sh	-c	This	will	not	work'	returned	a	non-zero	 code:	127  1	Note	use	of	cache.  Steps	1	through	4	were	skipped	because	they	were	already built	during	your	last	build.	Step	5	failed	because	there’s	no program	with	the	name	This	in	the	container.	The	container output	was	valuable	in	this	case	because	the	error	message informs	you	about	the	specific	problem	with	the	Dockerfile.	If you	fix	the	problem,	the	same	steps	will	be	skipped	again,	and the	build	will	succeed,	resulting	in	output	like Successfully	built	d7a8ee0cebd4.  The	use	of	caching	during	the	build	can	save	time	if	the	build includes	downloading	material,	compiling	programs,	or anything	else	that	is	time-intensive.	If	you	need	a	full	rebuild, you	can	use	the	--no-cache	flag	on	docker	image build	to	disable	the	use	of	the	cache.	Make	sure	you’re disabling	the	cache	only	when	required	because	it	will	place much	more	strain	on	upstream	source	systems	and	image- building	systems.  This	short	example	uses	4	of	the	18	Dockerfile	instructions. The	example	is	limited	in	that	all	the	files	added	to	the	image were	downloaded	from	the	network;	the	example	modifies	the   environment	in	a	limited	way	and	provides	a	general	tool.	The next	example,	which	has	a	more	specific	purpose	and	local code,	provides	a	more	complete	Dockerfile	primer.   8.2.	A	DOCKERFILE	PRIMER  Dockerfiles	are	expressive	and	easy	to	understand	because	of their	terse	syntax	that	allows	for	comments.	You	can	keep track	of	changes	to	Dockerfiles	with	any	version-control system.	Maintaining	multiple	versions	of	an	image	is	as	simple as	maintaining	multiple	Dockerfiles.	The	Dockerfile	build process	itself	uses	extensive	caching	to	aid	rapid	development and	iteration.	The	builds	are	traceable	and	reproducible.	They integrate	easily	with	existing	build	systems	and	many continuous	integration	tools.	With	all	these	reasons	to	prefer Dockerfile	builds	to	handmade	images,	it’s	important	to	learn how	to	write	them.  The	examples	in	this	section	cover	the	core	Dockerfile instructions	used	in	most	images.	The	following	sections	show how	to	create	downstream	behavior	and	more	maintainable Dockerfiles.	Every	instruction	is	covered	here	at	an introductory	level.	For	deep	coverage	of	each	instruction,	the best	reference	will	always	be	the	Docker	documentation	online at	https:  docs.docker.com engine reference builder .	The Docker	builder	reference	also	provides	examples	of	good Dockerfiles	and	a	best	practices	guide.  8.2.1.	Metadata	instructions  The	first	example	builds	a	base	image	and	two	other	images with	distinct	versions	of	the	mailer	program	you	used	in chapter	2.	The	purpose	of	the	program	is	to	listen	for	messages   on	a	TCP	port	and	then	send	those	messages	to	their	intended recipients.	The	first	version	of	the	mailer	will	listen	for messages	but	only	log	those	messages.	The	second	will	send the	message	as	an	HTTP	POST	to	the	defined	URL.  One	of	the	best	reasons	to	use	Dockerfile	builds	is	that	they simplify	copying	files	from	your	computer	into	an	image.	But it’s	not	always	appropriate	for	certain	files	to	be	copied	to images.	The	first	thing	to	do	when	starting	a	new	project	is	to define	which	files	should	never	be	copied	into	any	images. You	can	do	this	in	a	file	called	.dockerignore.	In	this	example, you’ll	create	three	Dockerfiles,	and	none	needs	to	be	copied into	the	resulting	images.  Use	your	favorite	text	editor	to	create	a	new	file	named .dockerignore	and	copy	in	the	following	lines:  .dockerignore mailer-base.df mailer-logging.df mailer-live.df  Save	and	close	the	file	when	you’re	finished.	This	will	prevent the	.dockerignore	file,	or	files	named	mailer-base.df,	mailer- logging.df,	or	mailer-live.df,	from	ever	being	copied	into	an image	during	a	build.	With	that	bit	of	accounting	finished,	you can	begin	working	on	the	base	image.  Building	a	base	image	helps	create	common	layers.	Each version	of	the	mailer	will	be	built	on	top	of	an	image	called mailer-base.	When	you	create	a	Dockerfile,	you	need	to keep	in	mind	that	each	Dockerfile	instruction	will	result	in	a   new	layer	being	created.	Instructions	should	be	combined whenever	possible	because	the	builder	won’t	perform	any optimization.	Putting	this	in	practice,	create	a	new	file	named mailer-base.df	and	add	the	following	lines:  FROM	debian:buster-20190910 LABEL	maintainer="dia@allingeek.com" RUN	groupadd	-r	-g	2200	example	&&	\ 				useradd	-rM	-g	example	-u	2200	example ENV	APPROOT=" app"	\ 				APP="mailer.sh"	\ 				VERSION="0.6" LABEL	base.name="Mailer	Archetype"	\ 						base.version="${VERSION}" WORKDIR	$APPROOT ADD	.	$APPROOT ENTRYPOINT	[" app mailer.sh"]						1 EXPOSE	33333 	Do	not	set	the	default	user	in	the	base	otherwise 	implementations	will	not	be	able	to	update	the	image 	USER	example:example  1	This	file	does	not	exist	yet.  Put	it	all	together	by	running	the	docker	image	build command	from	the	directory	where	the	mailer-base	file	is located.	The	-f	flag	tells	the	builder	which	filename	to	use	as input:  docker	image	build	-t	dockerinaction mailer-base:0.6	-f	mailer- base.df	.  Naming	Dockerfiles  The	default	and	most	common	name	for	a	Dockerfile	is Dockerfile.	However,	Dockerfiles	can	be	named	anything because	they	are	simple	text	files	and	the	build	command accepts	any	filename	you	tell	it.	Some	people	name	their   Dockerfiles	with	an	extension	such	as	.df	so	that	they	can easily	define	builds	for	multiple	images	in	a	single	project directory	 for	example,	app-build.df,	app-runtime.df,	and	app- debug-tools.df .	A	file	extension	also	makes	it	easy	to	activate Dockerfile	support	in	editors.  Five	new	instructions	are	introduced	in	this	Dockerfile.	The first	new	instruction	is	ENV.	ENV	sets	environment	variables for	an	image,	similar	to	the	--env	flag	on	docker container	run	or	docker	container	create.	In this	case,	a	single	ENV	instruction	is	used	to	set	three	distinct environment	variables.	That	could	have	been	accomplished with	three	subsequent	ENV	instructions,	though	doing	so would	result	in	the	creation	of	three	layers.	You	can	keep instructions	easy	to	read	by	using	a	backslash	to	escape	the newline	character	 just	as	in	shell	scripting :  Step	4 9	:	ENV	APPROOT=" app"					APP="mailer.sh" VERSION="0.6" 	--->	Running	in	c525f774240f Removing	intermediate	container	c525f774240f  Environment	variables	declared	in	the	Dockerfile	are	made available	to	the	resulting	image	but	can	be	used	in	other Dockerfile	instructions	as	substitutions.	In	this	Dockerfile,	the environment	variable	VERSION	was	used	as	a	substitution	in the	next	new	instruction,	LABEL:  Step	5 9	:	LABEL	base.name="Mailer	Archetype" base.version="${VERSION}" 	--->	Running	in	33d8f4d45042 Removing	intermediate	container	33d8f4d45042   	--->	20441d0f588e  The	LABEL	instruction	is	used	to	define	key value	pairs	that are	recorded	as	additional	metadata	for	an	image	or	container. This	mirrors	the	--label	flag	on	docker	run	and docker	create.	Like	the	ENV	instruction	before	it, multiple	labels	can	and	should	be	set	with	a	single	instruction. In	this	case,	the	value	of	the	VERSION	environment	variable was	substituted	for	the	value	of	the	base.version	label. By	using	an	environment	variable	in	this	way,	the	value	of VERSION	will	be	available	to	processes	running	inside	a container	as	well	as	recorded	to	an	appropriate	label.	This increases	maintainability	of	the	Dockerfile	because	it’s	more difficult	to	make	inconsistent	changes	when	the	valueis	set	in	a single	location.  Organizing	metadata	with	labels  Docker	Inc.	recommends	recording	metadata	with	labels	to help	organize	images,	networks,	containers,	and	other	objects. Each	label	key	should	be	prefixed	with	the	reverse	DNS notation	of	a	domain	that	is	controlled	or	collaborating	with the	author,	such	as	com. .some- label.	Labels	are	flexible,	extensible,	and	lightweight,	but the	lack	of	structure	makes	leveraging	the	information difficult.  The	Label	Schema	project	 http:  label-schema.org  	is	a community	effort	to	standardize	label	names	and	promote compatible	tooling.	The	schema	covers	many	important   attributes	of	an	image	such	as	build	date,	name,	and description.	For	example,	when	using	the	label	schema namespace,	the	key	for	the	build	date	is	named	org.label- schema.build-date	and	should	have	a	value	in	RFC 3339	format	such	as	2018-07-12T16:20:50.52Z.  The	next	two	instructions	are	WORKDIR	and	EXPOSE.	These are	similar	in	operation	to	their	corresponding	flags	on	the docker	run	and	docker	create	commands.	An environment	variable	was	substituted	for	the	argument	to	the WORKDIR	command:  Step	6 9	:	WORKDIR	$APPROOT Removing	intermediate	container	c2cb1fc7bf4f 	--->	cb7953a10e42  The	result	of	the	WORKDIR	instruction	will	be	an	image	with the	default	working	directory	set	to	 app.	Setting	WORKDIR to	a	location	that	doesn’t	exist	will	create	that	location	just	as it	would	with	the	command-line	option.	Last,	the	EXPOSE command	creates	a	layer	that	opens	TCP	port	33333:  Step	9 9	:	EXPOSE	33333 	--->	Running	in	cfb2afea5ada 	 Removing	intermediate	container	cfb2afea5ada 	--->	38a4767b8df4  The	parts	of	this	Dockerfile	that	you	should	recognize	are	the FROM,	LABEL,	and	ENTRYPOINT	instructions.	In	brief,	the FROM	instruction	sets	the	layer	stack	to	start	from	the   debian:buster-20190910	image.	Any	new	layers	built will	be	placed	on	top	of	that	image.	The	LABEL	instruction adds	key value	pairs	to	the	image’s	metadata.	The ENTRYPOINT	instruction	sets	the	executable	to	run	at container	startup.	Here,	it’s	setting	the	instruction	to	exec . mailer.sh	and	using	the	shell	form	of	the	instruction.  The	ENTRYPOINT	instruction	has	two	forms:	the	shell	form and	an	exec	form.	The	shell	form	looks	like	a	shell	command with	whitespace-delimited	arguments.	The	exec	form	is	a string	array	in	which	the	first	value	is	the	command	to	execute and	the	remaining	values	are	arguments.	A	command	specified using	the	shell	form	would	be	executed	as	an	argument	to	the default	shell.	Specifically,	the	command	used	in	this Dockerfile	will	be	executed	as	 bin sh	–c	'exec . mailer.sh'	at	runtime.	Most	importantly,	if	the	shell form	is	used	for	ENTRYPOINT,	all	other	arguments	provided by	the	CMD	instruction	or	at	runtime	as	extra	arguments	to docker	container	run	will	be	ignored.	This	makes	the shell	form	of	ENTRYPOINT	less	flexible.  You	can	see	from	the	build	output	that	the	ENV	and	LABEL instructions	each	resulted	in	a	single	step	and	layer.	But	the output	doesn’t	show	that	the	environment	variable	values	were substituted	correctly.	To	verify	that,	you’ll	need	to	inspect	the image:  docker	inspect	dockerinaction mailer-base:0.6  Tip   Remember,	the	docker	inspect	command	can	be	used	to view	the	metadata	of	either	a	container	or	an	image.	In	this case,	you	used	it	to	inspect	an	image.  The	relevant	lines	are	these:  "Env":	[ 				 "PATH= usr local sbin: usr local bin: usr sbin: usr bin: sbin: bin", 	 				"APPROOT= app", 				"APP=mailer.sh", 				"VERSION=0.6" ], ... "Labels":	{ 				"base.name":	"Mailer	Archetype", 				"base.version":	"0.6", 				"maintainer":	"dia@allingeek.com" }, ... "WorkingDir":	" app"  The	metadata	makes	it	clear	that	the	environment	variable substitution	works.	You	can	use	this	form	of	substitution	in	the ENV,	ADD,	COPY,	LABEL,	WORKDIR,	VOLUME,	EXPOSE, and	USER	instructions.  The	last	commented	line	is	a	metadata	instruction,	USER.	It sets	the	user	and	group	for	all	further	build	steps	and containers	created	from	the	image.	In	this	case,	setting	it	in	a base	image	would	prevent	any	downstream	Dockerfiles	from installing	software.	That	would	mean	that	those	Dockerfiles would	need	to	flip	the	default	back	and	forth	for	permission. Doing	so	would	create	at	least	two	additional	layers.	The   better	approach	would	be	to	set	up	the	user	and	group	accounts in	the	base	image	and	let	the	implementations	set	the	default user	when	they’ve	finished	building.  The	most	curious	thing	about	this	Dockerfile	is	that	the ENTRYPOINT	is	set	to	a	file	that	doesn’t	exist.	The	entrypoint will	fail	when	you	try	to	run	a	container	from	this	base	image. But	now	that	the	entrypoint	is	set	in	the	base	image,	that’s	one less	layer	that	will	need	to	be	duplicated	for	specific implementations	of	the	mailer.	The	next	two	Dockerfiles	build different	mailer.sh	implementations.  8.2.2.	Filesystem	instructions  Images	that	include	custom	functionality	will	need	to	modify the	filesystem.	A	Dockerfile	defines	three	instructions	that modify	the	filesystem:	COPY,	VOLUME,	and	ADD.	The Dockerfile	for	the	first	implementation	should	be	placed	in	a file	named	mailer-logging.df:  FROM	dockerinaction mailer-base:0.6 RUN	apt-get	update	&&	\ 				apt-get	install	-y	netcat COPY	[". log-impl",	"${APPROOT}"] RUN	chmod	a+x	${APPROOT} ${APP}	&&	\ 				chown	example:example	 var log USER	example:example VOLUME	[" var log"] CMD	[" var log mailer.log"]  In	this	Dockerfile,	you	use	the	image	generated	from	mailer- base	as	the	starting	point.	The	three	new	instructions	are COPY,	VOLUME,	and	CMD.	The	COPY	instruction	will	copy files	from	the	filesystem	where	the	image	is	being	built,	into   the	build	container.	The	COPY	instruction	takes	at	least	two arguments.	The	last	argument	is	the	destination,	and	all	other arguments	are	source	files.	This	instruction	has	only	one unexpected	feature:	any	files	copied	will	be	copied	with	file ownership	set	to	root.	This	is	the	case	regardless	of	how	the default	user	is	set	before	the	COPY	instruction.	It’s	better	to delay	any	RUN	instructions	to	change	file	ownership	until	all the	files	that	you	need	to	update	have	been	copied	into	the image.  The	COPY	instruction,	just	like	ENTRYPOINT	and	other instructions,	will	honor	both	shell	style	and	exec	style arguments.	But	if	any	of	the	arguments	contains	whitespace, you	need	to	use	the	exec	form.  Tip  Using	the	exec	 or	string	array 	form	wherever	possible	is	the best	practice.	At	a	minimum,	a	Dockerfile	should	be	consistent and	avoid	mixing	styles.	This	will	make	your	Dockerfiles more	readable	and	ensure	that	instructions	behave	as	you’d expect	without	detailed	understanding	of	their	nuances.  The	second	new	instruction	is	VOLUME.	This	behaves	exactly as	you’d	expect	if	you	understand	what	the	--volume	flag does	on	a	call	to	docker	run	or	docker	create.	Each value	in	the	string	array	argument	will	be	created	as	a	new volume	definition	in	the	resulting	layer.	Defining	volumes	at image	build	time	is	more	limiting	than	at	runtime.	You	have   no	way	to	specify	a	bind-mount	volume	or	read-only	volume at	image	build	time.	The	VOLUME	instruction	will	do	only	two things:	create	the	defined	location	in	the	image	filesystem	and then	add	a	volume	definition	to	the	image	metadata.  The	last	instruction	in	this	Dockerfile	is	CMD.	CMD	is	closely related	to	the	ENTRYPOINT	instruction,	as	shown	in	figure 8.1	They	both	take	either	shell	or	exec	forms	and	are	both	used to	start	a	process	within	a	container.	But	a	few	important differences	exist.  Figure	8.1.	Relationship	between	ENTRYPOINT	and	CMD  The	CMD	command	represents	an	argument	list	for	the entrypoint.	The	default	entrypoint	for	a	container	is	 bin sh. If	no	entrypoint	is	set	for	a	container,	the	values	are	passed, because	the	command	will	be	wrapped	by	the	default entrypoint.	But	if	the	entrypoint	is	set	and	is	declared	using	the exec	form,	you	use	CMD	to	set	default	arguments.	The	base	for this	Dockerfile	defines	the	ENTRYPOINT	as	the	mailer command.	This	Dockerfile	injects	an	implementation	of mailer.sh	and	defines	a	default	argument.	The	argument	used is	the	location	that	should	be	used	for	the	log	file.  Before	building	the	image,	you	need	to	create	the	logging version	of	the	mailer	program.	Create	a	directory	at	. log- impl.	Inside	that	directory,	create	a	file	named	mailer.sh	and   copy	the	following	script	into	the	file:  ! bin sh printf	"Logging	Mailer	has	started.\n" while	true do 				MESSAGE=$ nc	-l	-p	33333  				printf	"[Message]:	%s\n"	"$MESSAGE"	>	$1 				sleep	1 done  The	structural	specifics	of	this	script	are	unimportant.	All	you need	to	know	is	that	this	script	will	start	a	mailer	daemon	on port	33333	and	write	each	message	that	it	receives	to	the	file specified	in	the	first	argument	to	the	program.	Use	the following	command	to	build	the	mailer-logging	image from	the	directory	containing	mailer-logging.df:  docker	image	build	-t	dockerinaction mailer-logging	-f	mailer- logging.df	.  The	results	of	this	image	build	should	be	anticlimactic.	Go ahead	and	start	up	a	named	container	from	this	new	image:  docker	run	-d	--name	logging-mailer	dockerinaction mailer- logging  The	logging	mailer	should	now	be	built	and	running. Containers	that	link	to	this	implementation	will	have	their messages	logged	to	 var log mailer.log.	That’s	not	very interesting	or	useful	in	a	real-world	situation,	but	it	might	be handy	for	testing.	An	implementation	that	sends	email	would be	better	for	operational	monitoring.   The	next	implementation	example	uses	the	Simple	Email Service	provided	by	Amazon	Web	Services	to	send	email.	Get started	with	another	Dockerfile.	Name	this	file	mailer-live.df:  FROM	dockerinaction mailer-base:0.6 ADD	[". live-impl",	"${APPROOT}"] RUN	apt-get	update	&&	\ 				apt-get	install	-y	curl	netcat	python	&&	\ 				curl	"https:  bootstrap.pypa.io get-pip.py"	-o	"get-pip.py" &&	\ 				python	get-pip.py	&&	\ 				pip	install	awscli	&&	\ 				rm	get-pip.py	&&	\ 				chmod	a+x	"${APPROOT} ${APP}" USER	example:example CMD	["mailer@dockerinaction.com",	"pager@dockerinaction.com"]  This	Dockerfile	includes	one	new	instruction,	ADD.	The	ADD instruction	operates	similarly	to	the	COPY	instruction	with	two important	differences.	The	ADD	instruction	will  Fetch	remote	source	files	if	a	URL	is	specified  Extract	the	files	of	any	source	determined	to	be	an	archive	file  The	auto-extraction	of	archive	files	is	the	more	useful	of	the two.	Using	the	remote	fetch	feature	of	the	ADD	instruction isn’t	good	practice;	although	the	feature	is	convenient,	it provides	no	mechanism	for	cleaning	up	unused	files	and results	in	additional	layers.	Instead,	you	should	use	a	chained RUN	instruction,	like	the	third	instruction	of	mailer-live.df.  The	other	instruction	to	note	in	this	Dockerfile	is	CMD,	where two	arguments	are	passed.	Here	you’re	specifying	the	From and	To	fields	on	any	emails	that	are	sent.	This	differs	from mailer-logging.df,	which	specifies	only	one	argument.   Next,	create	a	new	subdirectory	named	live-impl	under	the location	containing	mailer-live.df.	Add	the	following	script	to a	file	in	that	directory	named	mailer.sh:  ! bin sh printf	"Live	Mailer	has	started.\n" while	true do 		MESSAGE=$ nc	-l	-p	33333  		aws	ses	send-email	--from	$1	\ 				--destination	{\"ToAddresses\":[\"$2\"]}	\ 	 				--message	"{\"Subject\":{\"Data\":\"Mailer	Alert\"},\ 																\"Body\":{\"Text\":{\"Data\":\"${MESSAGE}\"}}}" 		sleep	1 done  The	key	takeaway	from	this	script	is	that,	like	the	other	mailer implementation,	it	will	wait	for	connections	on	port	33333, take	action	on	any	received	messages,	and	then	sleep	for	a moment	before	waiting	for	another	message.	This	time, though,	the	script	will	send	an	email	using	the	Simple	Email Service	command-line	tool.	Build	and	start	a	container	with these	two	commands:  docker	image	build	-t	dockerinaction mailer-live	-f	mailer- live.df	. docker	run	-d	--name	live-mailer	dockerinaction mailer-live  If	you	link	a	watcher	to	these,	you’ll	find	that	the	logging mailer	works	as	advertised.	But	the	live	mailer	seems	to	be having	difficulty	connecting	to	the	Simple	Email	Service	to send	the	message.	With	a	bit	of	investigation,	you’ll	eventually realize	that	the	container	is	misconfigured.	The	aws	program requires	certain	environment	variables	to	be	set.   You	need	to	set	AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,	and	AWS_DEFAULT _REGION	in	order	to	get	this	example	working.	These environment	variables	define	the	AWS	cloud	credentials	and location	to	use	for	this	example.	Discovering	execution preconditions	one	by	one	as	programs	need	them	can	be frustrating	for	users.	Section	8.5.1	details	an	image	design pattern	that	reduces	this	friction	and	helps	adopters.  Before	you	get	to	design	patterns,	you	need	to	learn	about	the final	Dockerfile	instruction.	Remember,	not	all	images	contain applications.	Some	are	built	as	platforms	for	downstream images.	Those	cases	specifically	benefit	from	the	ability	to inject	downstream	build-time	behavior.   8.3.	INJECTING	DOWNSTREAM	BUILD-TIME BEHAVIOR  A	Dockerfile	instruction	that	is	important	for	authors	of	base images	is	ONBUILD.	The	ONBUILD	instruction	defines	other instructions	to	execute	if	the	resulting	image	is	used	as	a	base for	another	build.	For	example,	you	could	use	ONBUILD instructions	to	compile	a	program	that’s	provided	by	a downstream	layer.	The	upstream	Dockerfile	copies	the contents	of	the	build	directory	into	a	known	location	and	then compiles	the	code	at	that	location.	The	upstream	Dockerfile would	use	a	set	of	instructions	like	this:  ONBUILD	COPY	[".",	" var myapp"] ONBUILD	RUN	go	build	 var myapp  The	instructions	following	ONBUILD	aren’t	executed	when their	containing	Dockerfile	is	built.	Instead,	those	instructions are	recorded	in	the	resulting	image’s	metadata	under ContainerConfig.OnBuild.	The	previous	instructions would	result	in	the	following	metadata	inclusions:  ... "ContainerConfig":	{ ... 				"OnBuild":	[ 	 								"COPY	[\".\",	\" var myapp\"]", 								"RUN	go	build	 var myapp" 				], 				...   This	metadata	is	carried	forward	until	the	resulting	image	is used	as	the	base	for	another	Dockerfile	build.	When	a downstream	Dockerfile	uses	the	upstream	image	 the	one	with the	ONBUILD	instructions 	in	a	FROM	instruction,	those ONBUILD	instructions	are	executed	after	the	FROM	instruction and	before	the	next	instruction	in	a	Dockerfile.  Consider	the	following	example	to	see	exactly	when ONBUILD	steps	are	injected	into	a	build.	You	need	to	create two	Dockerfiles	and	execute	two	build	commands	to	get	the full	experience.	First,	create	an	upstream	Dockerfile	that defines	the	ONBUILD	instructions.	Name	the	file	base.df	and add	the	following	instructions:  FROM	busybox:latest WORKDIR	 app RUN	touch	 app base-evidence ONBUILD	RUN	ls	-al	 app  You	can	see	that	the	image	resulting	from	building	base.df	will add	an	empty	file	named	base-evidence	to	the	 app	directory. The	ONBUILD	instruction	will	list	the	contents	of	the	 app directory	at	build	time,	so	it’s	important	that	you	not	run	the build	in	quiet	mode	if	you	want	to	see	exactly	when	changes are	made	to	the	filesystem.  Next,	create	the	downstream	Dockerfile.	When	this	is	built, you	will	be	able	to	see	exactly	when	the	changes	are	made	to the	resulting	image.	Name	the	file	downstream.df	and	include the	following	contents:  FROM	dockerinaction ch8_onbuild RUN	touch	downstream-evidence RUN	ls	-al	.   RUN	ls	-al	.  This	Dockerfile	will	use	an	image	named dockerinaction ch8_onbuild	as	a	base,	so	that’s	the repository	name	you’ll	want	to	use	when	you	build	the	base. Then	you	can	see	that	the	downstream	build	will	create	a second	file	and	then	list	the	contents	of	 app	again.  With	these	two	files	in	place,	you’re	ready	to	start	building. Run	the	following	to	create	the	upstream	image:  docker	image	build	-t	dockerinaction ch8_onbuild	-f	base.df	.  The	output	of	the	build	should	look	like	this:  Sending	build	context	to	Docker	daemon		3.072kB Step	1 4	:	FROM	busybox:latest 	--->	6ad733544a63 Step	2 4	:	WORKDIR	 app Removing	intermediate	container	dfc7a2022b01 	--->	9bc8aeafdec1 	 Step	3 4	:	RUN	touch	 app base-evidence 	--->	Running	in	d20474e07e45 Removing	intermediate	container	d20474e07e45 	--->	5d4ca3516e28 Step	4 4	:	ONBUILD	RUN	ls	-al	 app 	--->	Running	in	fce3732daa59 Removing	intermediate	container	fce3732daa59 	--->	6ff141f94502 Successfully	built	6ff141f94502 Successfully	tagged	dockerinaction ch8_onbuild:latest  Then	build	the	downstream	image	with	this	command:  docker	image	build	-t	dockerinaction ch8_onbuild_down	-f downstream.df	.   The	results	clearly	show	when	the	ONBUILD	instruction	 from the	base	image 	is	executed:  Sending	build	context	to	Docker	daemon		3.072kB Step	1 3	:	FROM	dockerinaction ch8_onbuild 	Executing	1	build	trigger 	--->	Running	in	591f13f7a0e7 total	8 drwxr-xr-x				1	root					root										4096	Jun	18	03:12	. drwxr-xr-x				1	root					root										4096	Jun	18	03:13	.. -rw-r--r--				1	root					root													0	Jun	18	03:12	base- evidence Removing	intermediate	container	591f13f7a0e7 	--->	5b434b4be9d8 Step	2 3	:	RUN	touch	downstream-evidence 	--->	Running	in	a42c0044d14d Removing	intermediate	container	a42c0044d14d 	--->	e48a5ea7b66f Step	3 3	:	RUN	ls	-al	. 	--->	Running	in	7fc9c2d3b3a2 total	8 drwxr-xr-x				1	root					root										4096	Jun	18	03:13	. drwxr-xr-x				1	root					root										4096	Jun	18	03:13	.. -rw-r--r--				1	root					root													0	Jun	18	03:12	base- evidence -rw-r--r--				1	root					root													0	Jun	18	03:13 downstream-evidence Removing	intermediate	container	7fc9c2d3b3a2 	--->	46955a546cd3 Successfully	built	46955a546cd3 Successfully	tagged	dockerinaction ch8_onbuild_down:latest  You	can	see	the	builder	registering	the	ONBUILD	instruction with	the	container	metadata	in	step	4	of	the	base	build.	Later, the	output	of	the	downstream	image	build	shows	which triggers	 ONBUILD	instructions 	it	has	inherited	from	the	base image.	The	builder	discovers	and	processes	the	trigger immediately	after	step	0,	the	FROM	instruction.	The	output then	includes	the	result	of	the	RUN	instruction	specified	by	the trigger.	The	output	shows	that	only	evidence	of	the	base	build is	present.	Later,	when	the	builder	moves	on	to	instructions from	the	downstream	Dockerfile,	it	lists	the	contents	of	the    app	directory	again.	The	evidence	of	both	changes	is	listed.  That	example	is	more	illustrative	than	it	is	useful.	You	should consider	browsing	Docker	Hub	and	looking	for	images	tagged with	onbuild	suffixes	to	get	an	idea	about	how	this	is	used in	the	wild.	Here	are	a	couple	of	our	favorites:  https:  hub.docker.com r _ python   https:  hub.docker.com r _ node    8.4.	CREATING	MAINTAINABLE	DOCKERFILES  Dockerfile	has	features	that	make	maintaining	closely	related images	easier.	These	features	help	authors	share	metadata	and data	between	images	at	build	time.	Let’s	work	through	a couple	of	Dockerfile	implementations	and	use	these	features	to make	them	more	concise	and	maintainable.  As	you	were	writing	the	mailer	application’s	Dockerfiles,	you may	have	noticed	a	few	repeated	bits	that	need	to	change	for every	update.	The	VERSION	variable	is	the	best	example	of repetition.	The	version	metadata	goes	into	the	image	tag, environment	variable,	and	label	metadata.	There’s	another issue,	too.	Build	systems	often	derive	version	metadata	from the	application’s	version-control	system.	We	would	prefer	not to	hardcode	it	in	our	Dockerfiles	or	scripts.  The	Dockerfile’s	ARG	instruction	provides	a	solution	to	these problems.	ARG	defines	a	variable	that	users	can	provide	to Docker	when	building	an	image.	Docker	interpolates	the argument	value	into	the	Dockerfile,	allowing	creation	of parametrized	Dockerfiles.	You	provide	build	arguments	to	the docker	image	build	command	by	using	one	or	more	-- build-arg	 = 	options.  Let’s	introduce	the	ARG	VERSION	instruction	into	mailer- base.df	on	line	2:  FROM	debian:buster-20190910 ARG	VERSION=unknown																							1   LABEL	maintainer="dia@allingeek.com" RUN	groupadd	-r	-g	2200	example	&&	\ 				useradd	-rM	-g	example	-u	2200	example ENV	APPROOT=" app"	\ 				APP="mailer.sh"	\ 				VERSION="${VERSION}" LABEL	base.name="Mailer	Archetype"	\ 						base.version="${VERSION}" WORKDIR	$APPROOT ADD	.	$APPROOT ENTRYPOINT	[" app mailer.sh"] EXPOSE	33333  1	Defines	the	VERSION	build	arg	with	default	value	“unknown”  Now	the	version	can	be	defined	once	as	a	shell	variable	and passed	on	the	command	line	as	both	the	image	tag	and	a	build argument	for	use	within	the	image:  version=0.6;	docker	image	build	-t	dockerinaction mailer- base:${version}	\ 				-f	mailer-base.df	\ 				--build-arg	VERSION=${version}	\ 				.  Let’s	use	docker	image	inspect	to	verify	that	the VERSION	was	substituted	all	the	way	down	to	the base.version	label:  docker	image	inspect	--format	'{{	json	.Config.Labels	}}'	\ 				dockerinaction mailer-base:0.6  The	inspect	command	should	produce	JSON	output	that looks	like	this:  { 		"base.name":	"Mailer	Archetype", 		"base.version":	"0.6", 		"maintainer":	"dia@allingeek.com" }   If	you	had	not	specified	VERSION	as	a	build	argument,	the default	value	of	unknown	would	be	used	and	a	warning printed	during	the	build	process.  Let’s	turn	our	attention	to	multistage	builds,	which	can	help manage	important	concerns	by	distinguishing	between	phases of	an	image	build.	Multistage	builds	can	help	solve	a	few common	problems.	The	primary	uses	are	reusing	parts	of another	image,	separating	the	build	of	an	application	from	the build	of	an	application	runtime	image,	and	enhancing	an application’s	runtime	image	with	specialized	test	or	debug tools.	The	example	that	follows	demonstrates	reusing	parts	of another	image	as	well	as	separating	an	application’s	build	and runtime	concerns.	First,	let’s	learn	about	Dockerfile’s multistage	feature.  A	multistage	Dockerfile	is	a	Dockerfile	that	has	multiple FROM	instructions.	Each	FROM	instruction	marks	a	new	build stage	whose	final	layer	may	be	referenced	in	a	downstream stage.	The	build	stage	is	named	by	appending	AS	 	to the	FROM	instruction,	where	name	is	an	identifier	you	specify, such	as	builder.	The	name	can	be	used	in	subsequent	FROM and	COPY	--from= 	instructions, providing	a	convenient	way	to	identify	the	source	layer	for files	brought	into	the	image	build.	When	you	build	a Dockerfile	with	multiple	stages,	the	build	process	still produces	a	single	Docker	image.	The	image	is	produced	from the	final	stage	executed	in	the	Dockerfile.  Let’s	demonstrate	the	use	of	multistage	builds	with	an   example	that	uses	two	stages	and	a	bit	of	composition;	see figure	8.2.	An	easy	way	to	follow	along	with	this	example	is	to clone	the	Git	repository	at git@github.com:dockerinaction ch8_multi_st age_build.git.  Figure	8.2.	Multistage	Docker	builds  This	Dockerfile	defines	two	stages:	builder	and	runtime. The	builder	stage	gathers	dependencies	and	builds	the example	program.	The	runtime	stage	copies	the	certificate authority	 CA 	and	program	files	into	the	runtime	image	for execution.	The	source	of	the	http-client.df	Dockerfile	is   as	follows:   	Define	a	Builder	stage	and	build	app	inside	it FROM	golang:1-alpine	as	builder 	 	Install	CA	Certificates RUN	apk	update	&&	apk	add	ca-certificates 	 	Copy	source	into	Builder ENV	HTTP_CLIENT_SRC=$GOPATH src dia http-client  COPY	.	$HTTP_CLIENT_SRC WORKDIR	$HTTP_CLIENT_SRC 	 	Build	HTTP	Client RUN	CGO_ENABLED=0	GOOS=linux	GOARCH=amd64	\ 				go	build	-v	-o	 go bin http-client 	  	Define	a	stage	to	build	a	runtime	image. FROM	scratch	as	runtime ENV	PATH=" bin" 	Copy	CA	certificates	and	application	binary	from	builder stage COPY	--from=builder	\ 				 etc ssl certs ca-certificates.crt	 etc ssl certs ca- certificates.crt COPY	--from=builder	 go bin http-client	 http-client ENTRYPOINT	[" http-client"]  Let’s	examine	the	image	build	in	detail.	The	FROM golang:1-alpine	as	builder	instruction	declares that	the	first	stage	will	be	based	on	Golang’s	alpine	image variation	and	aliased	to	builder	for	easy	referencing	by later	stages.	First,	builder	installs	certificate	authority	files used	to	establish	Transport	Layer	Security	 TLS 	connections supporting	HTTPS.	These	CA	files	aren’t	used	in	this	stage, but	will	be	stored	for	composition	by	the	runtime	image.	Next, the	builder	stage	copies	the	http-client	source	code into	the	container	and	builds	the	http-client	Golang program	into	a	static	binary.	The	http-client	program	is   stored	in	the	builder	container	at	 go bin http-client.  The	http-client	program	is	simple.	It	makes	an	HTTP request	to	retrieve	its	own	source	code	from	GitHub:  package	main 	 import	  				"net http"   import	"io ioutil" import	"fmt" 	 func	main  	{ 				url	:=	"https:  raw.githubusercontent.com "	+ 	 							"dockerinaction ch8_multi_stage_build master http- client.go" 				resp,	err	:=	http.Get url  	 				if	err	!=	nil	{ 												panic err  				} 				defer	resp.Body.Close   				body,	err	:=	ioutil.ReadAll resp.Body  				fmt.Println "response:\n",	string body   }  The	runtime	stage	is	based	on	scratch.	When	you	build an	image	FROM	scratch,	the	filesystem	begins	empty	and the	image	will	contain	only	what	is	COPY’d	there.	Notice	that the	http.Get	statement	retrieves	the	file	by	using	the HTTPS	protocol.	This	means	the	program	will	need	a	set	of valid	TLS	certificate	authorities.	CA	authorities	are	available from	the	builder	stage	because	you	installed	them previously.	The	runtime	stage	copies	both	the	ca- certificates.crt	and	http-client	files	from	the	builder stage	into	the	runtime	stage	with	the	following:  COPY	--from=builder	\   COPY	--from=builder	\ 				 etc ssl certs ca-certificates.crt	 etc ssl certs ca- certificates.crt COPY	--from=builder	 go bin http-client	 http-client  The	runtime	stage	finishes	by	setting	the	ENTRYPOINT	of the	image	to	 http-client,	which	will	be	invoked	when the	container	starts.	The	final	image	will	contain	just	two	files. You	can	build	the	image	with	a	command	like	this:  docker	build	-t	dockerinaction http-client	-f	http-client.df	.  The	image	can	be	executed	as	follows:  docker	container	run	--rm	-it	dockerinaction http-client:latest  When	the	http-client	image	runs	successfully,	it	will output	the	http-client.go	source	code	listed	previously.	To recap,	the	http-client.df	Dockerfile	uses	a	builder	stage	to retrieve	runtime	dependencies	and	build	the	http-client program.	The	runtime	stage	then	copies	http-client and	its	dependencies	from	the	builder	stage	onto	the minimal	scratch	base	and	configures	it	for	execution.	The resulting	image	contains	only	what	is	needed	to	run	the program	and	is	just	over	6	MB	in	size.	In	the	next	section, we’ll	work	through	a	different	style	of	application	delivery using	defensive	startup	scripts.   8.5.	USING	STARTUP	SCRIPTS	AND	MULTIPROCESS CONTAINERS  Whatever	tooling	you	choose	to	use,	you’ll	always	need	to consider	a	few	image	design	aspects.	You’ll	need	to	ask yourself	whether	the	software	running	in	your	container requires	any	startup	assistance,	supervision,	monitoring,	or coordination	with	other	in-container	processes.	If	so,	you’ll need	to	include	a	startup	script	or	initialization	program	with the	image	and	install	it	as	the	entrypoint.  8.5.1.	Environmental	preconditions	validation  Failure	modes	are	difficult	to	communicate	and	can	catch someone	off	guard	if	they	occur	at	arbitrary	times.	If	container configuration	problems	always	cause	failures	at	startup	time for	an	image,	users	can	be	confident	that	a	started	container will	keep	running.  In	software	design,	failing	fast	and	precondition	validation	are best	practices.	It	makes	sense	that	the	same	should	hold	true for	image	design.	The	preconditions	that	should	be	evaluated are	assumptions	about	the	context.  Docker	containers	have	no	control	over	the	environment where	they’re	created.	They	do,	however,	have	control	of	their own	execution.	An	image	author	can	solidify	the	user experience	of	their	image	by	introducing	environment	and dependency	validation	prior	to	execution	of	the	main	task.	A   container	user	will	be	better	informed	about	the	requirements of	an	image	if	containers	built	from	that	image	fail	fast	and display	descriptive	error	messages.  For	example,	WordPress	requires	certain	environment variables	to	be	set	or	container	links	to	be	defined.	Without that	context,	WordPress	would	be	unable	to	connect	to	the database	where	the	blog	data	is	stored.	It	would	make	no	sense to	start	WordPress	in	a	container	without	access	to	the	data	it’s supposed	to	serve.	WordPress	images	use	a	script	as	the container	entrypoint.	That	script	validates	that	the	container context	is	set	in	a	way	that’s	compatible	with	the	contained version	of	WordPress.	If	any	required	condition	is	unmet	 a link	is	undefined	or	a	variable	is	unset ,	the	script	will	exit before	starting	WordPress,	and	the	container	will	stop unexpectedly.  Validating	the	preconditions	for	a	program	startup	is	generally use-case	specific.	If	you’re	packaging	software	into	an	image, you’ll	usually	need	to	write	a	script	or	carefully	configure	the tool	used	to	start	the	program	yourself.	The	startup	process should	validate	as	much	of	the	assumed	context	as	possible. This	should	include	the	following:  Presumed	links	 and	aliases   Environment	variables  Secrets  Network	access  Network	port	availability  Volumes  Root	filesystem	mount	parameters	 read-write	or	read-only    Current	user  You	can	use	whichever	scripting	or	programming	language you	want	to	accomplish	this	task.	In	the	spirit	of	building minimal	images,	it’s	a	good	idea	to	use	a	language	or	scripting tool	that’s	already	included	with	the	image.	Most	base	images ship	with	a	shell	such	as	 bin sh	or	 bin bash.	Shell	scripts	are the	most	common	because	shell	programs	are	commonly available	and	they	easily	adapt	to	program	and	environment- specific	requirements.	When	building	an	image	from scratch	for	a	single	binary	such	as	the	http-client example	from	section	8.4,	the	program	is	responsible	for validating	its	own	preconditions,	as	no	other	programs	will exist	in	the	container.  Consider	the	following	shell	script	that	might	accompany	a program	that	depends	on	a	web	server.	At	container	startup, this	script	enforces	that	either	another	container	has	been linked	to	the	web	alias	and	has	exposed	port	80,	or	the WEB_HOST	environment	variable	has	been	defined:  ! bin bash set	-e 	 if	[	-n	"$WEB_PORT_80_TCP"	];	then 		if	[	-z	"$WEB_HOST"	];	then 				WEB_HOST='web' 		else 				echo	>&2	'[WARN]:	Linked	container,	"web"	overridden	by $WEB_HOST.' 				echo	>&2	"===>	Connecting	to	WEB_HOST	 $WEB_HOST " 		fi fi 	 if	[	-z	"$WEB_HOST"	];	then 		echo	>&2	'[ERROR]:	specify	container	to	link;	"web"	or WEB_HOST	env	var' 		exit	1 fi   fi exec	"$@"		run	the	default	command  If	you’re	unfamiliar	with	shell	scripting,	this	is	an	appropriate time	to	learn	it.	The	topic	is	approachable,	and	several excellent	resources	are	available	for	self-directed	learning. This	specific	script	uses	a	pattern	in	which	both	an environment	variable	and	a	container	link	are	tested.	If	the environment	variable	is	set,	the	container	link	will	be	ignored. Finally,	the	default	command	is	executed.  Images	that	use	a	startup	script	to	validate	configuration should	fail	fast	if	someone	uses	them	incorrectly,	but	those same	containers	may	fail	later	for	other	reasons.	You	can combine	startup	scripts	with	container	restart	policies	to	make reliable	containers.	But	container	restart	policies	are	not perfect	solutions.	Containers	that	have	failed	and	are	waiting to	be	restarted	aren’t	running.	This	means	that	an	operator won’t	be	able	to	execute	another	process	within	a	container that’s	in	the	middle	of	a	backoff	window.	The	solution	to	this problem	involves	making	sure	the	container	never	stops.  8.5.2.	Initialization	processes  UNIX-based	computers	usually	start	an	initialization	 init  process	first.	That	init	process	is	responsible	for	starting	all	the other	system	services,	keeping	them	running,	and	shutting them	down.	It’s	often	appropriate	to	use	an	init-style	system	to launch,	manage,	restart,	and	shut	down	container	processes with	a	similar	tool.  Init	processes	typically	use	a	file	or	set	of	files	to	describe	the   ideal	state	of	the	initialized	system.	These	files	describe	what programs	to	start,	when	to	start	them,	and	what	actions	to	take when	they	stop.	Using	an	init	process	is	the	best	way	to	launch multiple	programs,	clean	up	orphaned	processes,	monitor processes,	and	automatically	restart	any	failed	processes.  If	you	decide	to	adopt	this	pattern,	you	should	use	the	init process	as	the	entrypoint	of	your	application-oriented	Docker container.	Depending	on	the	init	program	you	use,	you	may need	to	prepare	the	environment	beforehand	with	a	startup script.  For	example,	the	runit	program	doesn’t	pass	environment variables	to	the	programs	it	launches.	If	your	service	uses	a startup	script	to	validate	the	environment,	it	won’t	have	access to	the	environment	variables	it	needs.	The	best	way	to	fix	that problem	might	be	to	use	a	startup	script	for	the	runit	program. That	script	might	write	the	environment	variables	to	a	file	so the	startup	script	for	your	application	can	access	them.  Several	open	source	init	programs	exist.	Full-featured	Linux distributions	ship	with	heavyweight	and	full-featured	init systems	such	as	SysV,	Upstart,	and	systemd.	Linux	Docker images	such	as	Ubuntu,	Debian,	and	CentOS	typically	have their	init	programs	installed	but	nonfunctioning	out	of	the	box. These	can	be	complex	to	configure	and	may	have	hard dependencies	on	resources	that	require	root	access.	For	that reason,	the	community	has	tended	toward	the	use	of	lighter- weight	init	programs.  Popular	options	include	runit,	tini,	BusyBox	init,	Supervisord,   and	DAEMON	Tools.	These	all	attempt	to	solve	similar problems,	but	each	has	its	benefits	and	costs.	Using	an	init process	is	a	best	practice	for	application	containers,	but	there’s no	perfect	init	program	for	every	use	case.	When	evaluating any	init	program	for	use	in	a	container,	consider	these	factors:  Additional	dependencies	the	program	brings	into	the	image  How	the	program	passes	signals	to	its	child	processes	 or	if	it	does	at	all   File	sizes  Required	user	access  Monitoring	and	restart	functionality	 backoff-on-restart	features	are	a bonus   Zombie	process	cleanup	features  Init	processes	are	so	important	that	Docker	provides	an	-- init	option	to	run	an	init	process	inside	the	container	to manage	the	program	being	executed.	The	--init	option	can be	used	to	add	an	init	process	to	an	existing	image.	For example,	you	can	run	Netcat	using	the	alpine:3.6	image and	manage	it	with	an	init	process:  docker	container	run	-it	--init	alpine:3.6	nc	-l	-p	3000  If	you	inspect	the	host’s	processes	with	ps	-ef,	you	will	see Docker	ran	 dev init	--	nc	-l	-p	3000	inside	the container	instead	of	just	nc.	Docker	uses	the	tini	program as	an	init	process	by	default,	though	you	may	specify	another init	process	instead.  Whichever	init	program	you	decide	on,	make	sure	your	image uses	it	to	boost	adopter	confidence	in	containers	created	from   your	image.	If	the	container	needs	to	fail	fast	to	communicate a	configuration	problem,	make	sure	the	init	program	won’t hide	that	failure.	Now	that	you	have	a	solid	foundation	for running	and	signaling	processes	inside	containers,	let’s	see how	to	communicate	the	health	of	containerized	processes	to collaborators.  8.5.3.	The	purpose	and	use	of	health	checks  Health	checks	are	used	to	determine	whether	the	application running	inside	the	container	is	ready	and	able	to	perform	its function.	Engineers	define	application-specific	health	checks for	containers	to	detect	conditions	when	the	application	is running,	but	is	stuck	or	has	broken	dependencies.  Docker	runs	a	single	command	inside	the	container	to determine	whether	the	application	is	healthy.	There	are	two ways	to	specify	the	health	check	command:  Use	a	HEALTHCHECK	instruction	when	defining	the	image  On	the	command-line	when	running	a	container  This	Dockerfile	defines	a	health	check	for	the	NGINX	web server:  FROM	nginx:1.13-alpine 	 HEALTHCHECK	--interval=5s	--retries=2	\ 		CMD	nc	-vz	-w	2	localhost	80		exit	1  The	health	check	command	should	be	reliable,	lightweight, and	not	interfere	with	the	operation	of	the	main	application because	it	will	be	executed	frequently.	The	command’s	exit   status	will	be	used	to	determine	the	container’s	health.	Docker has	defined	the	following	exit	statuses:  0:	success—	The	container	is	healthy	and	ready	for	use.  1:	unhealthy—	The	container	is	not	working	correctly.  2:	reserved—	Do	not	use	this	exit	code.  Most	programs	in	the	UNIX	world	exit	with	a	0	status	when things	went	as	expected,	and	a	nonzero	status	otherwise.	The 	exit	1	is	a	bit	of	shell	trickery	that	means	or	exit	1. This	means	whenever	nc	exits	with	any	nonzero	status,	nc’s status	will	be	converted	to	1	so	that	Docker	knows	the container	is	unhealthy.	Conversion	of	nonzero	exit	statuses	to 1	is	a	common	pattern	because	Docker	does	not	define	the behavior	of	all	nonzero	health	check	statuses,	only	1	and	2.	As of	this	writing,	use	of	an	exit	code	whose	behavior	is	not defined	will	result	in	an	unhealthy	status.  Let’s	build	and	run	the	NGINX	example:  docker	image	build	-t	dockerinaction healthcheck	. docker	container	run	--name	healthcheck_ex	-d dockerinaction healthcheck  Now	that	a	container	with	a	health	check	is	running,	you	can inspect	the	container’s	health	status	with	docker	ps.	When a	health	check	is	defined,	the	docker	ps	command	reports the	container’s	current	health	status	in	the	STATUS	column. Docker	ps	output	can	be	a	bit	unwieldy,	so	you	will	use	a custom	format	that	prints	the	container	name,	image	name,	and status	in	a	table:  docker	ps	--format	'table	{{.Names}}\t{{.Image}}\t{{.Status}}'   docker	ps	--format	'table	{{.Names}}\t{{.Image}}\t{{.Status}}' NAMES															IMAGE																								STATUS healthcheck_ex						dockerinaction healthcheck			Up	3	minutes  healthy   By	default,	the	health	check	command	will	be	run	every	30 seconds,	and	three	failed	checks	are	required	before transitioning	the	container’s	health_status	to unhealthy.	The	health	check	interval	and	number	of consecutive	failures	before	reporting	a	container	as	unhealthy can	be	adjusted	in	the	HEALTHCHECK	instruction	or	when running	the	container.  The	health	check	facility	also	supports	options	for	the following:  Time-out—	A	time-out	for	the	health	check	command	to	run	and	exit.  Start	period—	A	grace	period	at	the	start	of	a	container	to	not	count	health check	failures	toward	the	health	status;	once	the	health	check	command returns	healthy,	the	container	is	considered	started,	and	subsequent failures	count	toward	the	health	status.  Image	authors	should	define	a	useful	health	check	in	images where	possible.	Usually	this	means	exercising	the	application in	some	way	or	checking	an	internal	application	health	status indicator	such	as	a	 health	endpoint	on	a	web	server. However,	sometimes	it	is	impractical	to	define	a HEALTHCHECK	instruction	because	not	enough	is	known about	how	the	image	will	run	ahead	of	time.	To	address	this problem,	Docker	provides	the	--health-cmd	to	define	a health	check	when	running	a	container.  Let’s	take	the	previous	HEALTHCHECK	example	and	specify   the	health	check	when	running	the	container	instead:  docker	container	run	--name=healthcheck_ex	-d	\ 		--health-cmd='nc	-vz	-w	2	localhost	80		exit	1'	\ 		nginx:1.13-alpine  Defining	a	health	check	at	runtime	overrides	the	health	check defined	in	the	image	if	one	exists.	This	is	useful	for	integrating a	third-party	image	because	you	can	account	for	requirements specific	to	your	environment.  These	are	the	tools	at	your	disposal	to	build	images	that	result in	durable	containers.	Durability	is	not	security,	and	although adopters	of	your	durable	images	might	trust	that	they	will	keep running	as	long	as	they	can,	they	shouldn’t	trust	your	images until	they’ve	been	hardened.   8.6.	BUILDING	HARDENED	APPLICATION	IMAGES  As	an	image	author,	it’s	difficult	to	anticipate	all	the	scenarios where	your	work	will	be	used.	For	that	reason,	harden	the images	you	produce	whenever	possible.	Hardening	an	image is	the	process	of	shaping	it	in	a	way	that	will	reduce	the	attack surface	inside	any	Docker	containers	based	on	it.  A	general	strategy	for	hardening	an	application	image	is	to minimize	the	software	included	with	it.	Naturally,	including fewer	components	reduces	the	number	of	potential vulnerabilities.	Further,	building	minimal	images	keeps	image download	times	short	and	helps	adopters	deploy	and	build containers	more	rapidly.  You	can	do	three	things	to	harden	an	image	beyond	that general	strategy.	First,	you	can	enforce	that	your	images	are built	from	a	specific	image.	Second,	you	can	make	sure	that regardless	of	how	containers	are	built	from	your	image,	they will	have	a	sensible	default	user.	Last,	you	should	eliminate	a common	path	for	root	user	escalation	from	programs	with setuid	or	setgid	attributes	set.  8.6.1.	Content-addressable	image	identifiers  The	image	identifiers	discussed	so	far	in	this	book	are	all designed	to	allow	an	author	to	update	images	in	a	transparent way	to	adopters.	An	image	author	chooses	what	image	their work	will	be	built	on	top	of,	but	that	layer	of	transparency   makes	it	difficult	to	trust	that	the	base	hasn’t	changed	since	it was	vetted	for	security	problems.	Since	Docker	1.6,	the	image identifier	has	included	an	optional	digest	component.  An	image	ID	that	includes	the	digest	component	is	called	a content-addressable	image	identifier	 CAIID .	This	refers	to	a specific	layer	containing	specific	content,	instead	of	simply referring	to	a	particular	and	potentially	changing	layer.  Now	image	authors	can	enforce	a	build	from	a	specific	and unchanging	starting	point	as	long	as	that	image	is	in	a	version 2	repository.	Append	an	@	symbol	followed	by	the	digest	in place	of	the	standard	tag	position.  Use	docker	image	pull	and	observe	the	line	labeled Digest	in	the	output	to	discover	the	digest	of	an	image	from a	remote	repository.	Once	you	have	the	digest,	you	can	use	it as	the	identifier	to	FROM	instructions	in	a	Dockerfile.	For example,	consider	the	following,	which	uses	a	specific snapshot	of	debian:stable	as	a	base:  docker	pull	debian:stable stable:	Pulling	from	library debian 31c6765cabf1:	Pull	complete Digest:	sha256:6aedee3ef827... 	 	Dockerfile: FROM	debian@sha256:6aedee3ef827... ...  Regardless	of	when	or	how	many	times	the	Dockerfile	is	used to	build	an	image,	each	build	will	use	the	content	identified with	that	CAIID	as	its	base	image.	This	is	particularly	useful for	incorporating	known	updates	to	a	base	into	your	images   and	identifying	the	exact	build	of	the	software	running	on	your computer.  Although	this	doesn’t	directly	limit	the	attack	surface	of	your images,	using	CAIIDs	will	prevent	it	from	changing	without your	knowledge.	The	next	two	practices	do	address	the	attack surface	of	an	image.  8.6.2.	User	permissions  The	known	container	breakout	tactics	all	rely	on	having system	administrator	privileges	inside	the	container.	Chapter	6 covers	the	tools	used	to	harden	containers.	That	chapter includes	a	deep	dive	into	user	management	and	a	discussion	of the	USR	Linux	namespace.	This	section	covers	standard practices	for	establishing	reasonable	user	defaults	for	images.  First,	please	understand	that	a	Docker	user	can	always override	image	defaults	when	creating	a	container.	For	that reason,	there’s	no	way	for	an	image	to	prevent	containers	from running	as	the	root	user.	The	best	things	an	image	author	can do	are	to	create	other	nonroot	users	and	establish	a	nonroot default	user	and	group.  Dockerfile	includes	a	USER	instruction	that	sets	the	user	and group	in	the	same	way	you	would	with	the	docker container	run	or	docker	container	create command.	The	instruction	itself	was	covered	in	the	Dockerfile primer.	This	section	is	about	considerations	and	best	practices.  The	best	practice	and	general	guidance	is	to	drop	privileges	as   soon	as	possible.	You	can	do	this	with	the	USER	instruction before	any	containers	are	ever	created	or	with	a	startup	script that’s	run	at	container	boot	time.	The	challenge	for	an	image author	is	to	determine	the	earliest	appropriate	time.  If	you	drop	privileges	too	early,	the	active	user	may	not	have permission	to	complete	the	instructions	in	a	Dockerfile.	For example,	this	Dockerfile	won’t	build	correctly:  FROM	busybox:latest USER	1000:1000 RUN	touch	 bin busybox  Building	that	Dockerfile	would	result	in	step	2	failing	with	a message	like	touch:	 bin busybox:	Permission denied.	File	access	is	obviously	impacted	by	user	changes. In	this	case,	UID	1000	doesn’t	have	permission	to	change	the ownership	of	the	file	 bin busybox.	That	file	is	currently owned	by	root.	Reversing	the	second	and	third	lines	would	fix the	build.  The	second	timing	consideration	is	the	permissions	and capabilities	needed	at	runtime.	If	the	image	starts	a	process that	requires	administrative	access	at	runtime,	it	would	make no	sense	to	drop	user	access	to	a	non-root	user	before	that point.	For	example,	any	process	that	needs	access	to	the system	port	range	 1–1024 	will	need	to	be	started	by	a	user with	administrative	 at	the	very	least	CAP_NET	_ADMIN  privileges.	Consider	what	happens	when	you	try	to	bind	to	port 80	as	a	nonroot	user	with	Netcat.	Place	the	following Dockerfile	in	a	file	named	UserPermissionDenied.df:   FROM	busybox:1.29 USER	1000:1000 ENTRYPOINT	["nc"] CMD	["-l",	"-p",	"80",	"0.0.0.0"]  Build	the	Dockerfile	and	run	the	resulting	image	in	a container.	In	this	case,	the	user	 UID	1000 	will	lack	the required	privileges,	and	the	command	will	fail:  docker	image	build	\ 				-t	dockerinaction ch8_perm_denied	\ 				-f	UserPermissionDenied.df	\ 				. docker	container	run	dockerinaction ch8_perm_denied  The	container	should	print	an	error	message:  nc:	bind:	Permission	denied  In	cases	like	these,	you	may	see	no	benefit	in	changing	the default	user.	Instead,	any	startup	scripts	that	you	build	should take	on	the	responsibility	of	dropping	permissions	as	soon	as possible.	The	last	question	is,	which	user	should	be	dropped into?  In	the	default	Docker	configuration,	containers	use	the	same Linux	USR	namespace	as	the	host.	This	means	that	UID	1000 in	the	container	is	UID	1000	on	the	host	machine.	All	other aspects	apart	from	the	UID	and	GID	are	segregated,	just	as they	would	be	between	computers.	For	example,	UID	1000	on your	laptop	might	be	your	username,	but	the	username associated	with	UID	1000	inside	a	BusyBox	container	could be	default,	busyuser,	or	whatever	the	BusyBox	image   maintainer	finds	convenient.	When	the	Docker	userns- remap	feature	described	in	chapter	6	is	enabled,	UIDs	in	the container	are	mapped	to	unprivileged	UIDs	on	the	host.	USR namespace	remapping	provides	full	UID	and	GID	segregation, even	for	root.	But	can	you	depend	on	userns-remap	being in	effect?  Image	authors	often	do	not	know	the	Docker	daemon configuration	where	their	images	will	run.	Even	if	Docker adopted	USR	namespace	remapping	in	a	default	configuration, it	will	be	difficult	for	image	authors	to	know	which	UID GID is	appropriate	to	use.	The	only	thing	we	can	be	sure	of	is	that it’s	inappropriate	to	use	common	or	system-level	UID GIDs when	doing	so	can	be	avoided.	With	that	in	mind,	using	raw UID GID	numbers	is	still	burdensome.	Doing	so	makes	scripts and	Dockerfiles	less	readable.	For	that	reason,	it’s	typical	for image	authors	to	include	RUN	instructions	that	create	users	and groups	used	by	the	image.	The	following	is	the	second instruction	in	a	PostgreSQL	Dockerfile:  	add	our	user	and	group	first	to	make	sure	their	IDs	get assigned 	consistently,	regardless	of	whatever	dependencies	get	added RUN	groupadd	-r	postgres	&&	useradd	-r	-g	postgres	postgres  This	instruction	simply	creates	a	postgres	user	and	group with	automatically	assigned	UID	and	GID.	The	instruction	is placed	early	in	the	Dockerfile	so	that	it	will	always	be	cached between	rebuilds,	and	the	IDs	remain	consistent	regardless	of other	users	that	are	added	as	part	of	the	build.	This	user	and group	could	then	be	used	in	a	USER	instruction.	That	would make	for	a	safer	default.	But	PostgreSQL	containers	require   elevated	privileges	during	startup.	Instead,	this	particular image	uses	a	su	or	sudo-like	program	called	gosu	to	start the	PostgreSQL	process	as	the	postgres	user.	Doing	so makes	sure	that	the	process	runs	without	administrative	access in	the	container.  User	permissions	are	one	of	the	more	nuanced	aspects	of building	Docker	images.	The	general	rule	you	should	follow	is that	if	the	image	you’re	building	is	designed	to	run	specific application	code,	the	default	execution	should	drop	user permissions	as	soon	as	possible.  A	properly	functioning	system	should	be	reasonably	secure with	reasonable	defaults	in	place.	Remember,	though,	an application	or	arbitrary	code	is	rarely	perfect	and	could	be intentionally	malicious.	For	that	reason,	you	should	take additional	steps	to	reduce	the	attack	surface	of	your	images.  8.6.3.	SUID	and	SGID	permissions  The	last	hardening	action	to	cover	is	the	mitigation	of setuid	 SUID 	or	setgid	 SGID 	permissions.	The	well- known	filesystem	permissions	 read,	write,	execute 	are	only	a portion	of	the	set	defined	by	Linux.	In	addition	to	those,	two are	of	particular	interest:	SUID	and	SGID.  These	two	are	similar	in	nature.	An	executable	file	with	the SUID	bit	set	will	always	execute	as	its	owner.	Consider	a program	like	 usr bin passwd,	which	is	owned	by	the	root	user and	has	the	SUID	permission	set.	If	a	nonroot	user	such	as bob	executes	passwd,	he	will	execute	that	program	as	the   root	user.	You	can	see	this	in	action	by	building	an	image	from the	following	Dockerfile:  FROM	ubuntu:latest 	Set	the	SUID	bit	on	whoami RUN	chmod	u+s	 usr bin whoami 	Create	an	example	user	and	set	it	as	the	default RUN	adduser	--system	--no-create-home	--disabled-password	-- disabled-login	\ 				--shell	 bin sh	example USER	example 	Set	the	default	to	compare	the	container	user	and 	the	effective	user	for	whoami CMD		printf	"Container	running	as:										%s\n"	$ id	-u	-n  &&	\ 					printf	"Effectively	running	whoami	as:	%s\n"	$ whoami   Once	you’ve	created	the	Dockerfile,	you	need	to	build	an image	and	run	the	default	command	in	a	container:  docker	image	build	-t	dockerinaction ch8_whoami	. docker	run	dockerinaction ch8_whoami  Doing	so	prints	results	like	these	to	the	terminal:  Container	running	as:										example Effectively	running	whoami	as:	root  The	output	of	the	default	command	shows	that	even	though you’ve	executed	the	whoami	command	as	the	example	user, it’s	running	from	the	context	of	the	root	user.	The	SGID	works similarly.	The	difference	is	that	the	execution	will	be	from	the owning	group’s	context,	not	the	owning	user.  Running	a	quick	search	on	your	base	image	will	give	you	an idea	of	how	many	and	which	files	have	these	permissions:   docker	run	--rm	debian:stretch	find	 	-perm	 u=s	-type	f  It	will	display	a	list	like	this:   bin umount  bin ping  bin su  bin mount  usr bin chfn  usr bin passwd  usr bin newgrp  usr bin gpasswd  usr bin chsh  This	command	will	find	all	of	the	SGID	files:  docker	container	run	--rm	debian:stretch	find	 	-perm	 g=s	- type	f  The	resulting	list	is	much	shorter:   sbin unix_chkpwd  usr bin chage  usr bin expiry  usr bin wall  Each	of	the	listed	files	in	this	particular	image	has	the	SUID	or SGID	permission,	and	a	bug	in	any	of	them	could	be	used	to compromise	the	root	account	inside	a	container.	The	good news	is	that	files	that	have	either	of	these	permissions	set	are typically	useful	during	image	builds	but	rarely	required	for application	use	cases.	If	your	image	is	going	to	be	running software	that’s	arbitrary	or	externally	sourced,	it’s	a	best practice	to	mitigate	this	risk	of	escalation.   Fix	this	problem	and	either	delete	all	these	files	or	unset	their SUID	and	SGID	permissions.	Taking	either	action	would reduce	the	image’s	attack	surface.	The	following	Dockerfile instruction	will	unset	the	SUID	and	GUID	permissions	on	all files	currently	in	the	image:  RUN	for	i	in	$ find	 	-type	f	\ 	-perm	 u=s	-o	-perm	 g=s	\  ; \ 				do	chmod	ug-s	$i;	done  Hardening	images	will	help	users	build	hardened	containers. Although	it’s	true	that	no	hardening	measures	will	protect users	from	intentionally	building	weak	containers,	those measures	will	help	the	more	unsuspecting	and	most	common type	of	user.   SUMMARY  Most	Docker	images	are	built	automatically	from	Dockerfiles. This	chapter	covers	the	build	automation	provided	by	Docker and	Dockerfile	best	practices.	Before	moving	on,	make	sure that	you’ve	understood	these	key	points:  Docker	provides	an	automated	image	builder	that	reads	instructions	from Dockerfiles.  Each	Dockerfile	instruction	results	in	the	creation	of	a	single	image	layer.  Merge	instructions	to	minimize	the	size	of	images	and	layer	count	when possible.  Dockerfiles	include	instructions	to	set	image	metadata	including	the default	user,	exposed	ports,	default	command,	and	entrypoint.  Other	Dockerfile	instructions	copy	files	from	the	local	filesystem	or	a remote	location	into	the	produced	images.  Downstream	builds	inherit	build	triggers	that	are	set	with	ONBUILD instructions	in	an	upstream	Dockerfile.  Dockerfile	maintenance	can	be	improved	with	multistage	builds	and	the ARG	instruction.  Startup	scripts	should	be	used	to	validate	the	execution	context	of	a container	before	launching	the	primary	application.  A	valid	execution	context	should	have	appropriate	environment	variables set,	network	dependencies	available,	and	an	appropriate	user configuration.  Init	programs	can	be	used	to	launch	multiple	processes,	monitor	those processes,	reap	orphaned	child	processes,	and	forward	signals	to	child processes.  Images	should	be	hardened	by	building	from	content-addressable	image identifiers,	creating	a	nonroot	default	user,	and	disabling	or	removing	any executable	with	SUID	or	SGID	permissions.   Chapter	9.	Public	and	private	software distribution  This	chapter	covers  Choosing	a	project	distribution	method  Using	hosted	infrastructure  Running	and	using	your	own	registry  Understanding	manual	image	distribution	workflows  Distributing	image	sources  You	have	your	own	images	of	software	you’ve	written, customized,	or	just	pulled	from	the	internet.	But	what	good	is an	image	if	nobody	can	install	it?	Docker	is	different	from other	container	management	tools	because	it	provides	image distribution	features.  There	are	several	ways	to	get	your	images	out	to	the	world. This	chapter	explores	those	distribution	paradigms	and provides	a	framework	for	making	or	choosing	one	or	more	for your	own	projects.  Hosted	registries	offer	both	public	and	private	repositories with	automated	build	tools.	By	contrast,	running	a	private registry	lets	you	hide	and	customize	your	image	distribution infrastructure.	Heavier	customization	of	a	distribution workflow	might	require	you	to	abandon	the	Docker	image distribution	facilities	and	build	your	own.	Some	systems	might abandon	the	image	as	the	distribution	unit	altogether	and   distribute	the	source	files	for	images	instead.	This	chapter	will teach	you	how	to	select	and	use	a	method	for	distributing	your images	to	the	world	or	just	at	work.   9.1.	CHOOSING	A	DISTRIBUTION	METHOD  The	most	difficult	thing	about	choosing	a	distribution	method is	choosing	the	appropriate	method	for	your	situation.	To	help with	this	problem,	each	method	presented	in	this	chapter	is examined	on	the	same	set	of	selection	criteria.  The	first	thing	to	recognize	about	distributing	software	with Docker	is	that	there’s	no	universal	solution.	Distribution requirements	vary	for	many	reasons,	and	several	methods	are available.	Every	method	has	Docker	tools	at	its	core,	so	it’s always	possible	to	migrate	from	one	to	another	with	minimal effort.	The	best	way	to	start	is	by	examining	the	full	spectrum of	options	at	a	high	level.  9.1.1.	A	distribution	spectrum  The	image	distribution	spectrum	offers	many	methods	with differing	levels	of	flexibility	and	complexity.	The	methods	that provide	the	most	flexibility	can	be	the	most	complicated	to use,	whereas	those	that	are	the	simplest	to	use	are	generally the	most	restrictive.	Figure	9.1	shows	the	full	spectrum.  Figure	9.1.	The	image	distribution	spectrum   The	methods	included	in	the	spectrum	range	from	hosted registries	such	as	Docker	Hub	to	totally	custom	distribution architectures	or	source-distribution	methods.	We	cover	some of	these	subjects	in	more	detail	than	others.	We	also	place particular	focus	on	private	registries	because	they	provide	the most	balance	between	the	two	concerns.  Having	a	spectrum	of	choices	illustrates	your	range	of	options, but	you	need	a	consistent	set	of	selection	criteria	in	order	to determine	which	you	should	use.  9.1.2.	Selection	criteria  Choosing	the	best	distribution	method	for	your	needs	may seem	daunting	with	this	many	options.	In	situations	like	these, you	should	take	the	time	to	understand	the	options,	identify criteria	for	making	a	selection,	and	avoid	the	urge	to	make	a quick	decision	or	settle.  The	following	identified	selection	criteria	are	based	on   differences	across	the	spectrum	and	on	common	business concerns.	When	making	a	decision,	consider	how	important each	of	these	is	in	your	situation:  Transport	speed	or	bandwidth	overhead  Cost  Visibility  Longevity	control  Availability	control  Access	control  Artifact	integrity  Artifact	confidentiality  Requisite	expertise  How	each	distribution	method	stacks	up	against	these	criteria is	covered	in	the	relevant	sections	over	the	rest	of	this	chapter.  Cost  Visibility  Cost	is	the	most	obvious	criterion,	and	the	distribution spectrum	ranges	in	cost	from	free	to	very	expensive,	and	“it’s complicated.”	Lower	cost	is	generally	better,	but	cost	is typically	the	most	flexible	criterion.	For	example,	most	people will	trade	cost	for	artifact	confidentiality	if	the	situation	calls for	it.  Visibility	is	the	next	most	obvious	criterion	for	a	distribution method.	Secret	projects	or	internal	tools	should	be	difficult	if not	impossible	for	unauthorized	people	to	discover.	In	another case,	public	works	or	open	source	projects	should	be	as	visible   as	possible	to	promote	adoption.  Transportation  Transportation	speed	and	bandwidth	overhead	are	the	next most	flexible	criteria.	File	sizes	and	image	installation	speed will	vary	between	methods	that	leverage	image	layers, concurrent	downloads,	and	prebuilt	images	and	those	that	use flat	image	files	or	rely	on	deployment-time	image	builds.	High transportation	speeds	or	low	installation	latency	is	critical	for systems	that	use	just-in-time	deployment	to	service synchronous	requests.	The	opposite	is	true	in	development environments	or	asynchronous	processing	systems.  Longevity  Longevity	control	is	a	business	concern	more	than	a	technical concern.	Hosted	distribution	methods	are	subject	to	other people’s	or	companies’	business	concerns.	An	executive	faced with	the	option	of	using	a	hosted	registry	might	ask,	“What happens	if	they	go	out	of	business	or	pivot	away	from repository	hosting?”	The	question	reduces	to,	“Will	the business	needs	of	the	third	party	change	before	ours?”	If	this	is a	concern	for	you,	longevity	control	is	important.	Docker makes	it	simple	to	switch	between	methods,	and	other	criteria such	as	requisite	expertise	or	cost	may	trump	this	concern.	For those	reasons,	longevity	control	is	another	of	the	more	flexible criteria.  Availability  Availability	control	is	the	ability	to	control	the	resolution	of availability	issues	with	your	repositories.	Hosted	solutions provide	no	availability	control.	Businesses	typically	provide	a   service-level	agreement	 SLA 	on	availability	if	you’re	a paying	customer,	but	there’s	nothing	you	can	do	to	directly resolve	an	issue.	On	the	other	end	of	the	spectrum,	private registries	or	custom	solutions	put	both	the	control	and responsibility	in	your	hands.  Access	control  Access	control	protects	your	images	from	modification	or access	by	unauthorized	parties.	Varying	degrees	of	access control	are	available.	Some	systems	provide	only	access control	of	modifications	to	a	specific	repository,	whereas others	provide	course	control	of	entire	registries.	Still	other systems	may	include	pay	walls	or	digital	rights	management controls.	Projects	typically	have	specific	access-control	needs dictated	by	the	product	or	business.	This	makes	access-control requirements	one	of	the	least	flexible	and	most	important	to consider.  Integrity  Artifact	integrity	and	confidentiality	both	fall	in	the	less- flexible	and	more-technical	end	of	the	spectrum.	Artifact integrity	is	trustworthiness	and	consistency	of	your	files	and images.	Violations	of	integrity	may	include	man-in-the-middle attacks,	in	which	an	attacker	intercepts	your	image	downloads and	replaces	the	content	with	their	own.	They	might	also include	malicious	or	hacked	registries	that	lie	about	the payloads	they	return.  Confidentiality  Artifact	confidentiality	is	a	common	requirement	for companies	developing	trade	secrets	or	proprietary	software.   For	example,	if	you	use	Docker	to	distribute	cryptographic material,	confidentiality	will	be	a	major	concern.	Artifact integrity	and	confidentiality	features	vary	across	the	spectrum. Overall,	the	out-of-the-box	distribution	security	features	won’t provide	the	tightest	confidentiality	or	integrity.	If	that’s	one	of your	needs,	an	information	security	professional	will	need	to implement	and	review	a	solution.  Expertise  The	last	thing	to	consider	when	choosing	a	distribution	method is	the	level	of	expertise	required.	Using	hosted	methods	can	be simple	and	requires	little	more	than	a	mechanical understanding	of	the	tools.	Building	custom	image	or	image source-distribution	pipelines	requires	expertise	with	a	suite	of related	technologies.	If	you	don’t	have	that	expertise	or	don’t have	access	to	someone	who	does,	using	more	complicated solutions	will	be	a	challenge.	In	that	case,	you	may	be	able	to reconcile	the	gap	at	additional	cost.  With	this	strong	set	of	selection	criteria,	you	can	begin learning	about	and	evaluating	various	distribution	methods. The	following	sections	evaluate	these	methods	against	the criteria	by	using	ratings	of	Worst,	Bad,	Good,	Better,	and	Best. The	best	place	to	start	is	on	the	far	left	of	the	spectrum	with hosted	registries.   9.2.	PUBLISHING	WITH	HOSTED	REGISTRIES  As	a	reminder,	Docker	registries	are	services	that	make repositories	accessible	to	Docker	pull	commands.	A	registry hosts	repositories.	The	simplest	way	to	distribute	your	images is	by	using	hosted	registries.  A	hosted	registry	is	a	Docker	registry	service	that’s	owned	and operated	by	a	third-party	vendor.	Docker	Hub,	Quay.io,	and Google	Container	Registry	are	all	examples	of	hosted	registry providers.	By	default,	Docker	publishes	to	Docker	Hub. Docker	Hub	and	most	other	hosted	registries	provide	both public	and	private	registries,	as	shown	in	figure	9.2.  Figure	9.2.	The	simplest	side	of	the	distribution	spectrum	and	the	topic	of	this	section  The	example	images	used	in	this	book	are	distributed	with public	repositories	hosted	on	Docker	Hub	and	Quay.io.	By	the end	of	this	section,	you’ll	understand	how	to	publish	your	own   images	by	using	hosted	registries	and	how	hosted	registries measure	up	to	the	selection	criteria.  9.2.1.	Publishing	with	public	repositories:	“Hello	World!” via	Docker	Hub  The	simplest	way	to	get	started	with	public	repositories	on hosted	registries	is	to	push	a	repository	that	you	own	to Docker	Hub.	To	do	so,	all	you	need	is	a	Docker	Hub	account and	an	image	to	publish.	If	you	haven’t	done	so	already,	sign up	for	a	Docker	Hub	account	now.  Once	you	have	your	account,	you	need	to	create	an	image	to publish.	Create	a	new	Dockerfile	named	HelloWorld.df	and add	the	following	instructions:  FROM	busybox:latest										1 CMD	echo	'Hello	World!'  1	From	HelloWorld.df  Chapter	8	covers	Dockerfile	instructions.	As	a	reminder,	the FROM	instruction	tells	the	Docker	image	builder	which existing	image	to	start	the	new	image	from.	The	CMD instruction	sets	the	default	command	for	the	new	image. Containers	created	from	this	image	will	display	Hello World!	and	exit.	Build	your	new	image	with	the	following command:  docker	image	build	\ 				-t	  hello-dockerfile	\						1 				-f	HelloWorld.df	\ 				.   1	Insert	your	username.  Be	sure	to	substitute	your	Docker	Hub	username	in	that command.	Authorization	to	access	and	modify	repositories	is based	on	the	username	portion	of	the	repository	name	on Docker	Hub.	If	you	create	a	repository	with	a	username	other than	your	own,	you	won’t	be	able	to	publish	it.  Publishing	images	on	Docker	Hub	with	the	docker command-line	tool	requires	that	you	establish	an	authenticated session	with	that	client.	You	can	do	that	with	the	login command:  docker	login  This	command	will	prompt	you	for	your	username,	email address,	and	password.	Each	of	those	can	be	passed	to	the command	as	arguments	using	the	--username,	--email, and	--password	flags.	When	you	log	in,	the	docker	client maintains	a	map	of	your	credentials	for	the	different	registries that	you	authenticate	with	in	a	file.	It	will	specifically	store your	username	and	an	authentication	token,	not	your password.  You	will	be	able	to	push	your	repository	to	the	hosted	registry after	you’ve	logged	in.	Use	the	docker	push	command	to do	so:  docker	image	push	  hello-dockerfile					 1  1	Insert	your	username.   Running	that	command	should	create	output	like	the following:  The	push	refers	to	a	repository [dockerinaction hello-dockerfile]	 len:	1  7f6d4eb1f937:	Image	already	exists 8c2e06607696:	Image	successfully	pushed 6ce2e90b0bc7:	Image	successfully	pushed cf2616975b4a:	Image	successfully	pushed Digest: 		 sha256:ef18de4b0ddf9ebd1cf5805fae1743181cbf3642f942cae8de7c5d4e375b1f20  The	command	output	includes	upload	statuses	and	the resulting	repository	content	digest.	The	push	operation	will create	the	repository	on	the	remote	registry,	upload	each	of	the new	layers,	and	then	create	the	appropriate	tags.  Your	public	repository	will	be	available	to	the	world	as	soon as	the	push	operation	is	completed.	Verify	that	this	is	the	case by	searching	for	your	username	and	your	new	repository.	For example,	use	the	following	command	to	find	the	example owned	by	the	dockerinaction	user:  docker	search	dockerinaction  Replace	the	dockerinaction	username	with	your	own	to find	your	new	repository	on	Docker	Hub.	You	can	also	log	in to	the	Docker	Hub	website	and	view	your	repositories	to	find and	modify	your	new	repository.  Having	distributed	your	first	image	with	Docker	Hub,	you should	consider	how	this	method	measures	up	to	the	selection criteria;	see	table	9.1.   Table	9.1.	Performance	of	public	hosted	repositories  	  	  																		  																		  Criteria  Rating  															  															  Cost  Best  	  	  	  	  																		  Notes  															  Visibility  Best  Transport speed size  Better  Longevity control  Good  Worst  Availability control Access	control Better  Artifact	integrity Best  Confidentiality Worst  Requisite experience  Best  Public	repositories	on	hosted	registries	are	almost	always	free.	That price	is	difficult	to	beat.	These	are	especially	helpful 																		when	you’re	getting	started	with	Docker	or	publishing open	source	software. 															 Hosted	registries	are	well-known	hubs	for	software	distribution.	A public	repository	on	a	hosted	registry	is	an	obvious	distribution 																		choice	if	you	want	your	project	to	be	well-known	and visible	to	the	public. 															 Hosted	registries	such	as	Docker	Hub	are	layer-aware	and	will	work with	Docker	clients	to	transfer	only	the	layers	that	the 																		client	doesn’t	already	have.	Further,	pull	operations	that require	multiple	repositories	to	be	transferred	will	perform	those 																		transfers	in	parallel.	For	those	reasons,	distributing	an image	from	a	hosted	repository	is	fast,	and	the	payloads	are	minimal. 															 You	have	no	longevity	control	over	hosted	registries.	But	registries	 will	all	conform	to	the	Docker	registry	API,	and	migrating 																		from	one	host	to	another	should	be	a	low-cost	exercise. You	have	no	availability	control	over	hosted	registries.  Public	repositories	are	open	to	the	public	for	read	access.	Write access	is	still	controlled	by	whatever	mechanisms	the	host 																		has	put	in	place.	Write	access	to	public	repositories	on Docker	Hub	is	controlled	in	two	ways.	First,	repositories	owned	by 																		an	individual	may	be	written	to	only	by	that	individual account.	Second,	repositories	owned	by	organizations	may	be written 																		to	by	any	user	who	is	part	of	that	organization. 															 The	current	version	of	the	Docker	registry	API,	V2,	provides content-addressable	images.	The	V2	API	lets	you	request	an	image 																		with	a	specific	cryptographic	signature.	The	Docker client	will	validate	the	integrity	of	the	returned	image	by recalculating 																		the	signature	and	comparing	it	to	the	one	requested.	Old versions	of	Docker	that	are	unaware	of	the	V2	registry	API	don’t 																		support	this	feature	and	use	V1	instead.	In	those	cases, and	for	other	cases	where	signatures	are	unknown,	a	high	degree	of 																		trust	is	put	into	the	authorization	and	at-rest	security features	provided	by	the	host. 															 Hosted	registries	and	public	repositories	are	never	appropriate	for storing	and	distributing	cleartext	secrets	or	sensitive 																		code.	Remember,	secrets	include	passwords,	API	keys, certificates,	and	more.	Anyone	can	access	these	secrets. 															 Using	public	repositories	on	hosted	registries	requires	only	that	you be	minimally	familiar	with	Docker	and	capable	of	setting 																		up	an	account	through	a	website.	This	solution	is	within reach	for	any	Docker	user. 															   Public	repositories	on	hosted	registries	are	the	best	choice	for owners	of	open	source	projects	or	people	who	are	just	getting started	with	Docker.	People	should	still	be	skeptical	of software	that	they	download	and	run	from	the	internet,	so public	repositories	that	don’t	expose	their	sources	can	be difficult	for	some	users	to	trust.	Hosted	 trusted 	builds	solve this	problem	to	a	certain	extent.  9.2.2.	Private	hosted	repositories  Private	repositories	are	similar	to	public	repositories	from	an operational	and	product	perspective.	Most	registry	providers offer	both	options,	and	any	differences	in	provisioning	through their	websites	will	be	minimal.	Because	the	Docker	registry API	makes	no	distinction	between	the	two	types	of repositories,	registry	providers	that	offer	both	generally require	you	to	provision	private	registries	through	their website,	app,	or	API.  The	tools	for	working	with	private	repositories	are	identical	to those	for	working	with	public	repositories,	with	one	exception. Before	you	can	use	docker	image	pull	or	docker container	run	to	install	an	image	from	a	private repository,	you	need	to	authenticate	with	the	registry	where the	repository	is	hosted.	To	do	so,	you	use	the	docker login	command	just	as	you	would	if	you	were	using docker	image	push	to	upload	an	image.  The	following	commands	prompt	you	to	authenticate	with	the registries	provided	by	Docker	Hub	and	Quay.io.	After	creating accounts	and	authenticating,	you’ll	have	full	access	to	your   public	and	private	repositories	on	all	three	registries.	The login	subcommand	takes	an	optional	server	argument:  docker	login 	Username:	dockerinaction 	Password: 	Email:	book@dockerinaction.com 	WARNING:	login	credentials	saved	in	 Users xxx .dockercfg. 	Login	Succeeded 	 docker	login	quay.io 	Username:	dockerinaction 	Password: 	Email:	book@dockerinaction.com 	WARNING:	login	credentials	saved	in	 Users xxx .dockercfg. 	Login	Succeeded  Before	you	decide	that	private	hosted	repositories	are	the distribution	solution	for	you,	consider	how	they	might	fulfill your	selection	criteria;	see	table	9.2.  Table	9.2.	Performance	of	private	hosted	repositories  	  	  																		  																		  Criteria  Rating  															  															  Cost  Good  	  	  	  	  																		  Notes  															  The	cost	of	private	repositories	typically	scales	with	the	number	of repositories	that	you	need.	Plans	usually	range	from 																		a	few	dollars	per	month	for	5	repositories,	to	around	$50 for	50	repositories.	Price	pressure	of	storage	and	monthly	virtual 																		server	hosting	is	a	driving	factor	here.	Users	or organizations	that	require	more	than	50	repositories	may	find	it	more appropriate 																		to	run	their	own	private	registry. 															 Private	repositories	are	by	definition	private.	These	are	typically excluded	from	indexes	and	should	require	authentication 																		before	a	registry	acknowledges	the	repository’s existence.	They	are	great	tools	for	organizations	that	don’t	want	to incur 																		the	overhead	associated	with	running	their	own	registry or	for	small	private	projects.	Private	repositories	are	poor	candidates 																		for	publicizing	availability	of	commercial	software	or distributing	open	source	images. 															 Any	hosted	registry	such	as	Docker	Hub	will	minimize	the bandwidth	used	to	transfer	an	image	and	enable	clients	to	transfer 																		an	image’s	layers	in	parallel.	Ignoring	potential	latency introduced	by	transferring	files	over	the	internet,	hosted	registries  Visibility  Best  Transport speed size  Better   Longevity control  Availability control  Good  Worst OK  Access	control Better  Artifact	integrity Best  Confidentiality Worst  Requisite experience  Best  introduced	by	transferring	files	over	the	internet,	hosted	registries 																		should	always	perform	well	against	other	nonregistry solutions. 															 You	have	no	longevity	control	over	hosted	registries.	But	registries	 will	all	conform	to	the	Docker	registry	API,	and	migrating 																		from	one	host	to	another	should	be	a	low-cost	exercise. No	hosted	registry	provides	any	availability	control.	Unlike	using public	repositories,	however,	using	private	repositories 																		will	make	you	a	paying	customer.	Paying	customers	may have	stronger	SLA	guarantees	or	access	to	support	personnel. 															 Both	read	and	write	access	to	private	repositories	is	restricted	to users	with	authorization. It’s	reasonable	to	expect	all	hosted	registries	to	support	the	V2 registry	API	and	content-addressable	images. Despite	the	privacy	provided	by	these	repositories,	they	are	never suitable	for	storing	cleartext	secrets	or	trade-secret 																		code.	Although	the	registries	require	user	authentication and	authorization	to	requested	resources,	these	mechanisms	have 																		several	potential	problems.	The	provider	may	use	weak credential	storage,	have	weak	or	lost	certificates,	or	leave	your artifacts 																		unencrypted	at	rest.	Finally,	your	secret	material	should not	be	accessible	to	employees	of	the	registry	provider. 															 As	with	public	repositories,	using	private	repositories	on	hosted registries	requires	only	that	you	be	minimally	familiar 																		with	Docker	and	capable	of	setting	up	an	account	through a	website.	This	solution	is	within	reach	for	any	Docker	user. 															  Individuals	and	small	teams	will	find	the	most	utility	in	private hosted	repositories.	Their	low	cost	and	basic	authorization features	are	friendly	to	low-budget	projects	or	private	projects with	minimal	security	requirements.	Large	companies	or projects	that	need	a	higher	degree	of	secrecy	and	have	a suitable	budget	may	find	their	needs	better	met	by	running their	own	private	registry.   9.3.	INTRODUCING	PRIVATE	REGISTRIES  When	you	have	a	hard	requirement	on	availability	control, longevity	control,	or	secrecy,	then	running	a	private	registry may	be	your	best	option.	In	doing	so,	you	gain	control	without sacrificing	interoperability	with	Docker	pull	and	push mechanisms	or	adding	to	the	learning	curve	for	your environment.	People	can	interact	with	a	private	registry exactly	as	they	would	with	a	hosted	registry.  Many	free	and	commercially	supported	software	packages	are available	for	running	a	Docker	image	registry.	If	your organization	has	a	commercial	artifact	repository	for	operating system	or	application	software	packages,	it	probably	supports the	Docker	image	registry	API.	A	simple	option	for	running	a nonproduction	image	registry	is	to	use	Docker’s	registry software.	The	Docker	registry,	called	Distribution,	is	open source	software	and	distributed	under	the	Apache	2	license. The	availability	of	this	software	and	permissive	license	keep the	engineering	cost	of	running	your	own	registry	low.	Figure 9.3	illustrates	that	private	registries	fall	in	the	middle	of	the distribution	spectrum.  Figure	9.3.	Private	registries	in	the	image	distribution	spectrum   Running	a	private	registry	is	a	great	distribution	method	if	you have	special	infrastructure	use	cases	like	the	following:  Regional	image	caches  Team-specific	image	distribution	for	locality	or	visibility  Environment	or	deployment	stage-specific	image	pools  Corporate	processes	for	approving	images  Longevity	control	of	external	images  Before	deciding	that	this	is	the	best	choice	for	you,	consider the	costs	detailed	in	the	selection	criteria,	shown	in	table	9.3.  Table	9.3.	Performance	of	private	registries  	  	  																		  																		  Criteria  Rating  															  															  Cost  Good  	  	  	  	  																		  Notes  															  At	a	minimum,	a	private	registry	adds	to	hardware	overhead	 virtual or	otherwise ,	support	expense,	and	risk	of	failure.	But 																		the	community	has	already	invested	the	bulk	of	the engineering	effort	required	to	deploy	a	private	registry	by	building the 																		open	source	software.	Cost	will	scale	on	different dimensions	than	hosted	registries.	Whereas	the	cost	of	hosted repositories 																		scales	with	raw	repository	count,	the	cost	of	private   Visibility  Good  Transport speed size  Best  Best  Longevity control Availability control Access	control Good  Best  Artifact	integrity Best  Confidentiality Good  Requisite experience  Good  																		scales	with	raw	repository	count,	the	cost	of	private registries	scales	with	transaction	rates	and	storage	usage.	If	you	build 																		a	system	with	high	transaction	rates,	you’ll	need	to	scale up	the	number	of	registry	hosts	so	that	you	can	handle	the	demand. 																		Likewise,	registries	that	serve	a	certain	number	of	small images	will	have	lower	storage	costs	than	those	serving	the	same 																		number	of	large	images. 															 Private	registries	are	as	visible	as	you	decide	to	make	them.	But	even a	registry	that	you	own	and	open	up	to	the	world	will 																		be	less	visible	than	advertised	popular	registries	such	as Docker	Hub. 															 Latency	of	operations	between	any	client	and	any	registry	will	vary based	on	network	performance	between	those	two	nodes	and 																		load	on	the	registry.	Private	registries	may	be	faster	or slower	than	hosted	registries	because	of	these	variables.	Most	people 																		operating	large-scale	deployments	or	internal infrastructure	will	find	private	registries	appealing.	Private	registries eliminate 																		a	dependency	on	the	internet	or	inter-datacenter networking	and	will	improve	latency	proportionate	to	the	external network 																		constraint.	Because	this	solution	uses	a	Docker	registry,	it shares	the	same	parallelism	gains	as	hosted	registry	solutions. 															 You	have	full	control	over	solution	longevity	as	the	registry	owner.  You	have	full	control	over	availability	as	the	registry	owner.  The	registry	software	doesn’t	include	any	authentication	or authorization	features	out	of	the	box.	But	implementing	those 																		features	can	be	achieved	with	a	minimal	engineering exercise. 															 Version	2	of	the	registry	API	supports	content-addressable	images, and	the	open	source	software	supports	a	pluggable	storage 																		backend.	For	additional	integrity	protections,	you	can force	the	use	of	TLS	over	the	network	and	use	backend	storage	with 																		encryption	at	rest. 															 Private	registries	are	the	first	solution	on	the	spectrum	appropriate for	storage	of	trade	secrets	or	secret	material.	You 																		control	the	authentication	and	authorization	mechanisms. You	also	control	the	network	and	in-transit	security	mechanisms. 																		Most	importantly,	you	control	the	at-rest	storage.	It’s	in your	power	to	ensure	that	the	system	is	configured	in	such	a	way 																		that	your	secrets	stay	secret. 															 Getting	started	and	running	a	local	registry	requires	only	basic Docker	experience.	But	running	and	maintaining	a	highly	available 																		production	private	registry	requires	experience	with several	technologies.	The	specific	set	depends	on	what	features	you want 																		to	take	advantage	of.	Generally,	you’ll	want	to	be familiar	with	NGINX	to	build	a	proxy,	LDAP	or	Kerberos	to provide	authentication, 																		and	Redis	for	caching.	Many	commercial	product solutions	are	available	for	running	a	private	Docker	registry,	ranging from 																		traditional	artifact	repositories	such	as	Artifactory	and Nexus	to	software	delivery	systems	like	GitLab. 															   The	biggest	trade-off	when	going	from	hosted	registries	to private	registries	is	gaining	flexibility	and	control	while requiring	greater	depth	and	breadth	of	engineering	experience to	build	and	maintain	the	solution.	Docker	image	registries often	consume	large	amounts	of	storage,	so	be	sure	to	account for	that	in	your	analysis.	The	remainder	of	this	section	covers what	you	need	in	order	to	implement	all	but	the	most complicated	registry	deployment	designs	and	highlights opportunities	for	customization	in	your	environment.  9.3.1.	Using	the	registry	image  Whatever	your	reasons	for	doing	so,	getting	started	with	the Docker	registry	software	is	easy.	The	Distribution	software	is available	on	Docker	Hub	in	a	repository	named	registry. Starting	a	local	registry	in	a	container	can	be	done	with	a single	command:  docker	run	-d	-p	5000:5000	\ 								-v	"$ pwd " data: tmp registry-dev	\ 								--restart=always	--name	local-registry	registry:2  The	image	that’s	distributed	through	Docker	Hub	is configured	for	insecure	access	from	the	machine	running	a client’s	Docker	daemon.	When	you’ve	started	the	registry,	you can	use	it	like	any	other	registry	with	docker	pull,	run, tag,	and	push	commands.	In	this	case,	the	registry	location is	localhost:5000.	The	architecture	of	your	system should	now	match	that	described	in	figure	9.4.  Figure	9.4.	Interactions	between	the	Docker	client,	daemon,	local	registry	container,	and	local storage   Companies	that	want	tight	version	control	on	their	external image	dependencies	will	pull	images	from	external	sources such	as	Docker	Hub	and	copy	them	into	their	own	registry. You	might	do	this	to	ensure	that	an	important	image	does	not change	or	disappear	unexpectedly	when	the	author	updates	or removes	the	source	image.	To	get	an	idea	of	what	it’s	like working	with	your	registry,	consider	a	workflow	for	copying images	from	Docker	Hub	into	your	new	registry:  docker	image	pull	dockerinaction ch9_registry_bound																		 1  docker	image	ls	-f	"label=dia_excercise=ch9_registry_bound"										 2  docker	image	tag	dockerinaction ch9_registry_bound	\ 				localhost:5000 dockerinaction ch9_registry_bound  docker	image	push	 localhost:5000 dockerinaction ch9_registry_bound			3   1	Pulls	demo	image	from	Docker	Hub  2	Verifies	image	is	discoverable	with	label	filter  3	Pushes	demo	image	into	registry  In	running	these	four	commands,	you	copy	an	example repository	from	Docker	Hub	into	your	local	repository.	If	you execute	these	commands	from	the	same	location	from	which you	started	the	registry,	you’ll	find	that	the	newly	created	data subdirectory	contains	new	registry	data.  9.3.2.	Consuming	images	from	your	registry  The	tight	integration	you	get	with	the	Docker	ecosystem	can make	it	feel	like	you’re	working	with	software	that’s	already installed	on	your	computer.	When	internet	latency	has	been eliminated,	such	as	when	you’re	working	with	a	local	registry, it	can	feel	even	less	like	you’re	working	with	distributed components.	For	that	reason,	the	exercise	of	pushing	data	into a	local	repository	isn’t	very	exciting	on	its	own.  The	next	set	of	commands	should	impress	on	you	that	you’re working	with	a	real	registry.	These	commands	will	remove	the example	repositories	from	the	local	cache	for	your	Docker daemon,	demonstrate	that	they’re	gone,	and	then	reinstall	them from	your	personal	registry:  docker	image	rm	\ 				dockerinaction ch9_registry_bound	\ 				localhost:5000 dockerinaction ch9_registry_bound																		 1  docker	image	ls	-f	"label=dia_excercise=ch9_registry_bound"  docker	image	pull	 localhost:5000 dockerinaction ch9_registry_bound				2   docker	image	ls	-f	"label=dia_excercise=ch9_registry_bound"											 3  docker	container	rm	-vf	local-registry																																 4  1	Removes	tagged	reference  2	Pulls	from	registry	again  3	Demonstrates	that	image	is	back  4	Cleans	up	local	registry  You	can	work	with	this	registry	locally	as	much	as	you	want, but	the	insecure	default	configuration	will	prevent	remote Docker	clients	from	using	your	registry	 unless	they specifically	allow	insecure	access .	This	is	one	of	the	few issues	that	you’ll	need	to	address	before	deploying	a	registry in	a	production	environment.  This	is	the	most	flexible	distribution	method	that	involves Docker	registries.	If	you	need	greater	control	over	transport, storage,	and	artifact	management,	you	should	consider working	directly	with	images	in	a	manual	distribution	system.   9.4.	MANUAL	IMAGE	PUBLISHING	AND DISTRIBUTION  Images	are	files,	and	you	can	distribute	them	as	you	would	any other	file.	It’s	common	to	see	software	available	for	download on	websites,	File	Transport	Protocol	 FTP 	servers,	corporate storage	networks,	or	via	peer-to-peer	networks.	You	could	use any	of	these	distribution	channels	for	image	distribution.	You can	even	use	email	or	a	USB	drive	in	cases	where	you	know your	image	recipients.	Manual	image	distribution	methods provide	the	ultimate	in	flexibility,	enabling	varied	use	cases such	as	distributing	images	to	many	people	at	an	event simultaneously	or	to	a	secure	air-gapped	network.  When	you	work	with	images	as	files,	you	use	Docker	only	to manage	local	images	and	create	files.	All	other	concerns	are left	for	you	to	implement.	That	void	of	functionality	makes manual	image	publishing	and	distribution	the	second-most flexible	but	complicated	distribution	method.	This	section covers	custom	image	distribution	infrastructure,	shown	on	the spectrum	in	figure	9.5.  Figure	9.5.	Docker	image	distribution	over	custom	infrastructure   We’ve	already	covered	all	the	methods	for	working	with images	as	files.	Chapter	3	covers	loading	images	into	Docker and	saving	images	to	your	hard	drive.	Chapter	7	covers exporting	and	importing	full	filesystems	as	flattened	images. These	techniques	are	the	foundation	for	building	distribution workflows	like	the	one	shown	in	figure	9.6.  Figure	9.6.	A	typical	manual	distribution	workflow	with	producer,	transport,	and	consumers  This	workflow	is	a	generalization	of	how	you’d	use	Docker	to create	an	image	and	prepare	it	for	distribution.	You	should	be familiar	with	using	docker	image	build	to	create	an   image,	and	docker	image	save	or	docker container	export	to	create	an	image	file.	You	can perform	each	of	these	operations	with	a	single	command.  You	can	use	any	file	transport	after	you	have	an	image	in	file form.	One	custom	component	not	shown	in	figure	9.6	is	the mechanism	that	uploads	an	image	to	the	transport.	That mechanism	may	be	a	folder	that	is	watched	by	a	file-sharing tool	such	as	Dropbox.	It	could	also	be	a	piece	of	custom	code that	runs	periodically,	or	in	response	to	a	new	file,	and	uses FTP	or	HTTP	to	push	the	file	to	a	remote	server.	Whatever	the mechanism,	this	general	component	will	require	some	effort	to integrate.  The	figure	also	shows	how	a	client	would	ingest	the	image	and use	it	to	build	a	container	after	the	image	has	been	distributed. Clients	require	a	process	or	mechanism	to	learn	where	the image	is	located	and	then	acquire	the	image	from	the	remote source.	Once	clients	have	the	image	file,	they	can	use	the docker	image	load	or	import	commands	to	complete the	transfer.  Manual	image	distribution	methods	are	difficult	to	measure against	the	selection	criteria	without	knowing	the	specifics	of the	distribution	problem.	Using	a	non-Docker	distribution channel	gives	you	full	control,	making	it	possible	to	handle unusual	requirements.	It	will	be	up	to	you	to	determine	how your	options	measure	against	the	selection	criteria.	Table	9.4 explores	how	manual	image	distribution	methods	rate	against the	selection	criteria.  Table	9.4.	Performance	of	custom	image	distribution	infrastructure  	  	  	   	  	  																		  																		  Criteria  Rating  															  															  Cost  Good  	  	  	  	  																		  Notes  															  Distribution	costs	are	driven	by	bandwidth,	storage,	and	hardware needs.	Hosted	distribution	solutions	such	as	cloud	storage 																		will	bundle	these	costs	and	generally	scale	down	price per	unit	as	your	usage	increases.	But	hosted	solutions	bundle	in	the 																		cost	of	personnel	and	several	other	benefits	that	you	may not	need,	driving	up	the	price	compared	to	a	mechanism	that	you 																		own. 															 Most	manual	distribution	methods	are	special	and	will	take	more effort	to	advertise	and	use	than	public	or	private	registries. 																		Examples	might	include	using	popular	websites	or	other well-known	file	distribution	hubs. 															 Whereas	transport	speed	depends	on	the	transport,	file	sizes	are dependent	on	your	choice	of	using	layered	images	or	flattened 																		images.	Remember,	layered	images	maintain	the	history of	the	image,	container-creation	metadata,	and	old	files	that	might 																		have	been	deleted	or	overridden.	Flattened	images contain	only	the	current	set	of	files	on	the	filesystem. 															 Using	proprietary	protocols,	tools,	or	other	technology	that	is	neither open	nor	under	your	control	will	impact	longevity 																		control.	For	example,	distributing	image	files	with	a hosted	file-sharing	service	such	as	Dropbox	will	give	you	no longevity 																		control.	On	the	other	hand,	swapping	USB	drives	with your	friend	will	last	as	long	as	the	two	of	you	decide	to	use	USB drives. 															 If	availability	control	is	an	important	factor	for	your	case,	you	can use	a	transport	mechanism	that	you	own. You	could	use	a	transport	with	the	access	control	features	you	need or	use	file	encryption.	If	you	built	a	system	that	encrypted 																		your	image	files	with	a	specific	key,	you	could	be	sure that	only	a	person	or	people	with	the	correct	key	could	access	the 																		image. 															 Integrity	validation	is	a	more	expensive	feature	to	implement	for broad	distribution.	At	a	minimum,	you’d	need	a	trusted communication 																		channel	for	advertising	cryptographic	file	signatures	and creating	archives	that	maintain	image	and	layer	signatures	by	using 																		docker	image	save	and	load. 															 You	can	implement	content	secrecy	with	cheap	encryption	tools.	If you	need	meta-secrecy	 where	the	exchange	itself	is	secret  																		as	well	as	content	secrecy,	then	you	should	avoid	hosted tools	and	make	sure	that	the	transport	you	use	provides	secrecy  HTTPS, 																		SFTP,	SSH,	or	offline . 															 Hosted	tools	will	typically	be	designed	for	ease	of	use	and	require	a lesser	degree	of	experience	to	integrate	with	your	workflow. 																		But	you	can	as	easily	use	simple	tools	that	you	own	in most	cases.  Visibility  Bad  Transport speed size  Good  Longevity control  Bad  Best  Availability control Access	control Bad  Artifact	integrity Bad  Confidentiality Good  Requisite experience  Good   most	cases. 															  All	the	same	criteria	apply	to	manual	distribution,	but	it’s difficult	to	discuss	them	without	the	context	of	a	specific transportation	method.  9.4.1.	A	sample	distribution	infrastructure	using	FTP  Building	a	fully	functioning	example	will	help	you	understand exactly	what	goes	into	a	manual	distribution	infrastructure. This	section	will	help	you	build	an	infrastructure	with	the	File Transfer	Protocol.  FTP	is	less	popular	than	it	used	to	be.	The	protocol	provides no	secrecy	and	requires	credentials	to	be	transmitted	over	the wire	for	authentication.	But	the	software	is	freely	available, and	clients	have	been	written	for	most	platforms.	That	makes FTP	a	great	tool	for	building	your	own	distribution infrastructure.	Figure	9.7	illustrates	what	you’ll	build.  Figure	9.7.	An	FTP	publishing	infrastructure  The	example	in	this	section	uses	two	existing	images.	The first,	dockerinaction ch9	_ftpd,	is	a	specialization	of the	centos:6	image;	vsftpd	 an	FTP	daemon 	has	been installed	and	configured	for	anonymous	write	access.	The second	image,	dockerinaction ch9_ftp_client,	is	a specialization	of	a	popular	minimal	Alpine	Linux	image.	An   FTP	client	named	LFTP	has	been	installed	and	set	as	the entrypoint	for	the	image.  To	prepare	for	the	experiment,	pull	a	known	image	from Docker	Hub	that	you	want	to	distribute.	In	the	example,	the registry:2	image	is	used:  docker	image	pull	registry:2  Once	you	have	an	image	to	distribute,	you	can	begin.	The	first step	is	building	your	image	distribution	infrastructure.	In	this case,	that	means	running	an	FTP	server,	which	you	will	do	on a	dedicated	network:  docker	network	create	ch9_ftp docker	container	run	-d	--name	ftp-server	--network=ch9_ftp	-p 21:21	\ 				dockerinaction ch9_ftpd  This	command	starts	an	FTP	server	that	accepts	FTP connections	on	TCP	port	21	 the	default	port .	Don’t	use	this image	in	any	production	capacity.	The	server	is	configured	to allow	anonymous	connections	write	access	under	the pub incoming	folder.	Your	distribution	infrastructure	will	use that	folder	as	an	image	distribution	point.  Next,	export	an	image	to	the	file	format.	You	can	use	the following	command	to	do	so:  docker	image	save	-o	. registry.2.tar	registry:2  Running	this	command	exports	the	registry:2	image	as	a   structured	image	file	in	your	current	directory.	The	file	retains all	the	metadata	and	history	associated	with	the	image.	At	this point,	you	could	inject	all	sorts	of	phases,	such	as	checksum generation	or	file	encryption.	This	infrastructure	has	no	such requirements,	and	you	should	move	along	to	distribution.  The	dockerinaction ch9_ftp_client	image	has	an FTP	client	installed	and	can	be	used	to	upload	your	new	image file	to	your	FTP	server.	Remember,	you	started	the	FTP	server in	a	container	named	ftp-server.	The	ftp-server container	is	attached	to	a	user-defined	bridge	network	 see chapter	5 	named	ch9_ftp,	and	other	containers	attached	to the	ch9_ftp	network	will	be	able	to	connect	to	ftp- server.	Let’s	upload	the	registry	image	archive	with	an	FTP client:  docker	container	run	--rm	-it	--network	ch9_ftp	\ 				-v	"$ pwd ": data	\ 				dockerinaction ch9_ftp_client	\ 				-e	'cd	pub incoming;	put	registry.2.tar;	exit'	ftp-server  This	command	creates	a	container	with	a	volume	bound	to your	local	directory	and	joined	to	the	ch9_ftp	network where	the	FTP	server	container	is	listening.	The	command uses	LFTP	to	upload	a	file	named	registry.2.tar	to	the	server located	at	ftp_server.	You	can	verify	that	you	uploaded the	image	by	listing	the	contents	of	the	FTP	server’s	folder:  docker	run	--rm	-it	--network	ch9_ftp	\ 				-v	"$ pwd ": data	\ 				dockerinaction ch9_ftp_client	\ 				-e	"cd	pub incoming;	ls;	exit"	ftp-server   The	registry	image	is	now	available	for	download	to	any	FTP client	that	knows	about	the	server	and	can	access	it	over	the network.	But	that	file	may	never	be	overridden	in	the	current FTP	server	configuration.	You’d	need	to	come	up	with	your own	versioning	scheme	if	you	were	going	to	use	a	similar	tool in	production.  Advertising	the	availability	of	the	image	in	this	scenario requires	clients	to	periodically	poll	the	server	by	using	the	last command	you	ran	to	list	files.	Alternatively,	you	could	build	a website	or	send	an	email	notifying	clients	about	the	image,	but that	all	happens	outside	the	standard	FTP	transfer	workflow.  Before	moving	on	to	evaluating	this	distribution	method against	the	selection	criteria,	consume	the	registry	image	from your	FTP	server	to	get	an	idea	of	how	clients	would	need	to integrate.  First,	eliminate	the	registry	image	from	your	local	image	cache and	the	file	from	your	local	directory:  rm	registry.2.tar docker	image	rm	registry:2						1 docker	image	ls	registry								2  1	Need	to	remove	any	registry	containers	first  2	Confirms	the	registry	image	has	been	removed  Then	download	the	image	file	from	your	FTP	server	by	using the	FTP	client:  docker	container	run	--rm	-it	--network	ch9_ftp	\ 				-v	"$ pwd ": data	\ 				dockerinaction ch9_ftp_client	\   				dockerinaction ch9_ftp_client	\ 				-e	'cd	pub incoming;	get	registry.2.tar;	exit'	ftp-server  At	this	point,	you	should	once	again	have	the	registry.2.tar	file in	your	local	directory.	You	can	reload	that	image	into	your local	cache	with	the	docker	load	command:  docker	image	load	-i	registry.2.tar  You	can	confirm	that	the	image	has	been	loaded	from	the archive	by	listing	images	for	the	registry	repository	again	with docker	image	ls	registry.  This	is	a	minimal	example	of	how	a	manual	image-publishing and	distribution	infrastructure	might	be	built.	With	a	bit	of extension,	you	could	build	a	production-quality,	FTP-based distribution	hub.	In	its	current	configuration,	this	example matches	against	the	selection	criteria,	as	shown	in	table	9.5.  Table	9.5.

All	the	related	software	is	free. Bandwidth	and	storage	costs	should	scale	linearly	with	the 																		number	of	images	hosted	and	the	number	of	clients. 															 The	FTP	server	is	running	in	an	unadvertised	location	with	a	non- standard	integration	workflow.	The	visibility	of	this	configuration 																		is	very	low. 															 In	this	example,	all	the	transport	happens	between	containers	on	the same	computer,	so	all	the	commands	finish	quickly.	If 																		a	client	connects	to	your	FTP	service	over	the	network, speeds	are	directly	impacted	by	your	upload	speeds.	This distribution 																		method	will	download	redundant	artifacts	and	won’t download	components	of	the	image	in	parallel.	Overall,	this	method isn’t 																		bandwidth-efficient. 															   Best  Longevity control Availability control Access	control Worst Artifact	integrity Worst  Best  Confidentiality Worst Requisite Good experience  You	can	use	the	FTP	server	created	for	this	example	as	long	as	you want. You	have	full	availability	control	of	the	FTP	server.	If	it	becomes unavailable,	you’re	the	only	person	who	can	restore	service. This	configuration	provides	no	access	control. The	network	transportation	layer	does	provide	file	integrity	between endpoints.	But	it’s	susceptible	to	interception	attacks, 																		and	no	integrity	protections	exist	between	file	creation and	upload	or	between	download	and	import. 															 This	configuration	provides	no	secrecy. All	requisite	experience	for	implementing	this	solution	has	been provided	here.	If	you’re	interested	in	extending	the	example 																		for	production,	you	need	to	familiarize	yourself	with vsftpd	configuration	options	and	SFTP. 															  In	short,	there’s	almost	no	real	scenario	where	this	transport configuration	is	appropriate.	But	it	helps	illustrate	the	different concerns	and	basic	workflows	that	you	can	create	when	you work	with	image	as	files.	Try	to	imagine	how	replacing	FTP with	scp	or	rsync	tooling	using	the	SSH	protocol	would improve	the	system’s	performance	for	artifact	integrity	and secrecy.	The	final	image	distribution	method	we	will	consider distributes	image	sources	and	is	both	more	flexible	and potentially	complicated.   9.5.	IMAGE	SOURCE-DISTRIBUTION	WORKFLOWS  When	you	distribute	image	sources	instead	of	images,	you	cut out	all	the	Docker	distribution	workflow	and	rely	solely	on	the Docker	image	builder.	As	with	manual	image	publishing	and distribution,	source-distribution	workflows	should	be evaluated	against	the	selection	criteria	in	the	context	of	a particular	implementation.  Using	a	hosted	source	control	system	such	as	Git	on	GitHub will	have	very	different	traits	from	using	a	file	backup	tool such	as	rsync.	In	a	way,	source-distribution	workflows	have a	superset	of	the	concerns	of	manual	image	publishing	and distribution	workflows.	You’ll	have	to	build	your	workflow, but	without	the	help	of	the	docker	save,	load,	export, or	import	commands.	Producers	need	to	determine	how	they will	package	their	sources,	and	consumers	need	to	understand how	those	sources	are	packaged	as	well	as	how	to	build	an image	from	them.	That	expanded	interface	makes	source- distribution	workflows	the	most	flexible	and	potentially complicated	distribution	method.	Figure	9.8	shows	image source	distribution	on	the	most	complicated	end	of	the spectrum.  Figure	9.8.	Using	existing	infrastructure	to	distribute	image	sources   Image	source	distribution	is	one	of	the	most	common	methods, despite	having	the	most	potential	for	complication.	Popular version-control	software	handles	many	of	the	complications	of source	distribution’s	expanded	interface.  9.5.1.	Distributing	a	project	with	Dockerfile	on	GitHub  When	you	use	Dockerfile	and	GitHub	to	distribute	image sources,	image	consumers	clone	your	GitHub	repository directly	and	use	docker	image	build	to	build	your image	locally.	With	source	distribution,	publishers	don’t	need an	account	on	Docker	Hub	or	another	Docker	registry	to publish	an	image.  Supposing	a	producer	has	an	existing	project,	Dockerfile,	and GitHub	repository,	their	distribution	workflow	will	look	like this:  git	init git	config	--global	user.email	"you@example.com" git	config	--global	user.name	"Your	Name" git	add	Dockerfile 	git	add	*whatever	other	files	you	need	for	the	image*   	git	add	*whatever	other	files	you	need	for	the	image* git	commit	-m	"first	commit" git	remote	add	origin	https:  github.com   <your repo>.git git	push	-u	origin	master  Meanwhile,	a	consumer	would	use	a	general	command	set	that looks	like	this:  git	clone	https:  github.com    .git cd	  docker	image	build	-t	   .	.  These	are	all	steps	that	a	regular	Git	or	GitHub	user	is	familiar with,	as	shown	in	table	9.6.  Table	9.6.	Performance	of	image	source	distribution	via	GitHub  	  	  	  	  																		  																		  Criteria  Rating  															  															  Cost Visibility  Best Best  Transport speed size  Good  Longevity control  Bad  Worst  Availability control Access	control Good  Artifact	integrity Good  	  	  																		  Notes  															  There’s	no	cost	if	you’re	using	a	public	GitHub	repository. GitHub	is	a	highly	visible	location	for	open	source	tools.	It	provides excellent	social	and	search	components,	making	project 																		discovery	simple. 															 By	distributing	image	sources,	you	can	leverage	other	registries	for base	layers.	Doing	so	will	reduce	the	transportation 																		and	storage	burden.	GitHub	also	provides	a	content delivery	network	 CDN .	That	CDN	is	used	to	make	sure	clients around	the 																		world	can	access	projects	on	GitHub	with	low	network latency. 															 Although	Git	is	a	popular	tool	and	should	be	around	for	a	while,	you forgo	any	longevity	control	by	integrating	with	GitHub 																		or	other	hosted	version-control	providers. 															 Relying	on	GitHub	or	other	hosted	version-control	providers eliminates	any	availability	control. GitHub	or	other	hosted	version-control	providers	do	provide	access control-tools	for	private	repositories. This	solution	provides	no	integrity	for	the	images	produced	as	part of	the	build	process,	or	of	the	sources	after	they	have 																		been	cloned	to	the	client	machine.	But	integrity	is	the whole	point	of	version-control	systems.	Any	integrity	problems should 																		be	apparent	and	easily	recoverable	through	standard	Git   Confidentiality Worst Requisite Good Experience  																		be	apparent	and	easily	recoverable	through	standard	Git processes. 															 Public	projects	provide	no	source	secrecy. Image	producers	and	consumers	need	to	be	familiar	with	Dockerfile, the	Docker	builder,	and	the	Git	tooling.  Image	source	distribution	is	divorced	from	all	Docker distribution	tools.	By	relying	only	on	the	image	builder,	you’re free	to	adopt	any	distribution	toolset	available.	If	you’re locked	into	a	particular	toolset	for	distribution	or	source control,	this	may	be	the	only	option	that	meets	your	criteria.   SUMMARY  This	chapter	covers	various	software	distribution	mechanisms and	the	value	contributed	by	Docker	in	each.	A	reader	that	has recently	implemented	a	distribution	channel,	or	is	currently doing	so,	might	take	away	additional	insights	into	their solution.	Others	will	learn	more	about	available	choices.	In either	case,	it	is	important	to	make	sure	that	you	have	gained the	following	insights	before	moving	on:  Having	a	spectrum	of	choices	illustrates	your	range	of	options.  You	should	use	a	consistent	set	of	selection	criteria	in	order	to	evaluate your	distribution	options	and	determine	which	method	you	should	use.  Hosted	public	repositories	provide	excellent	project	visibility,	are	free,	and require	little	experience	to	adopt.  Consumers	will	have	a	higher	degree	of	trust	in	images	generated	by automated	builds	because	a	trusted	third	party	builds	them.  Hosted	private	repositories	are	cost-effective	for	small	teams	and	provide satisfactory	access	control.  Running	your	own	registry	enables	you	to	build	infrastructure	suitable	for special	use	cases	without	abandoning	the	Docker	distribution	facilities.  Distributing	images	as	files	can	be	accomplished	with	any	file-sharing system.  Image	source	distribution	is	flexible	but	only	as	complicated	as	you	make it.	Using	popular	source-distribution	tools	and	patterns	will	keep	things simple.   Chapter	10.	Image	pipelines  This	chapter	covers  The	goals	of	Docker	image	pipelines  Patterns	for	building	images	and	using	metadata	to	help	consumers	use your	image  Common	approaches	for	testing	that	images	are	configured	correctly	and secure  Patterns	for	tagging	images	so	they	can	be	identified	and	delivered	to consumers  Patterns	for	publishing	images	to	runtime	environments	and	registries  In	chapter	8,	you	learned	how	to	build	Docker	images automatically	by	using	Dockerfiles	and	the	docker	build command.	However,	building	the	image	is	merely	one	critical step	in	a	longer	process	for	delivering	functioning	and trustworthy	images.	Image	publishers	should	perform	tests	to verify	that	the	image	works	under	the	expected	operating conditions.	Confidence	in	the	correctness	of	the	image	artifact grows	as	it	passes	those	tests.	Next,	it	can	finally	be	tagged and	published	to	a	registry	for	consumption.	Consumers	can deploy	these	images	with	confidence,	knowing	that	many important	requirements	have	already	been	verified.  These	steps—preparing	image	material,	building	an	image, testing,	and	finally	publishing	images	to	registries—are together	called	an	image	build	pipeline.	Pipelines	help software	authors	quickly	publish	updates	and	efficiently deliver	new	features	and	fixes	to	consumers.   10.1.	GOALS	OF	AN	IMAGE	BUILD	PIPELINE  In	this	context,	pipelines	automate	the	process	for	building, testing,	and	publishing	artifacts	so	they	can	be	deployed	to	a runtime	environment.	Figure	10.1	illustrates	the	high-level process	for	building	software	or	other	artifacts	in	a	pipeline. This	process	should	be	familiar	to	anyone	using	continuous integration	 CI 	practices	and	is	not	specific	to	Docker	images.  Figure	10.1.	Generic	artifact	build	pipeline  People	often	automate	build	pipelines	with	continuous integration	systems	such	as	Jenkins,	Travis	CI,	or	Drone. Regardless	of	the	specific	pipeline-modeling	technology,	the goal	of	a	build	pipeline	is	to	apply	a	consistent	set	of	rigorous practices	in	creating	deployable	artifacts	from	source definitions.	Differences	between	the	specific	tools	employed in	a	pipeline	are	simply	an	implementation	detail.	A	CI process	for	a	Docker	image	is	similar	to	other	software artifacts	and	looks	like	figure	10.2.  Figure	10.2.	A	Docker	image	build	pipeline   When	building	a	Docker	image,	this	process	includes	the following	steps:  1.	 Check	out	a	clean	copy	of	the	source	code	defining	the	image	and	build  scripts	so	the	origin	and	process	used	to	build	the	image	is	known.  2.	 2	Retrieve	or	generate	artifacts	that	will	be	included	in	the	image,	such	as  the	application	package	and	runtime	libraries.  3.	 Build	the	image	by	using	a	Dockerfile. 4.	 Verify	that	the	image	is	structured	and	functions	as	intended. 5.	  Optional 	Verify	that	the	image	does	not	contain	known	vulnerabilities. 6.	 Tag	the	image	so	that	it	can	be	consumed	easily. 7.	 Publish	the	image	to	a	registry	or	another	distribution	channel.  Application	artifacts	are	the	runtime	scripts,	binaries	 .exe, .tgz,	.zip ,	and	configuration	files	produced	by	software authors.	This	image	build	process	assumes	the	application artifacts	have	already	been	built,	tested,	and	published	to	an artifact	repository	for	inclusion	in	an	image.	The	application artifact	may	be	built	inside	a	container,	and	this	is	how	many modern	CI	systems	operate.	The	exercises	in	this	chapter	will show	how	to	build	applications	by	using	containers	and	how	to package	those	application	artifacts	into	a	Docker	image	that runs	the	application.	We	will	implement	the	build	process	by using	a	small	and	common	set	of	tools	available	in	UNIX-like   environments.	This	pipeline’s	concepts	and	basic	commands should	be	easily	transferrable	into	your	organization’s	own tooling.   10.2.	PATTERNS	FOR	BUILDING	IMAGES  Several	patterns	exist	for	building	applications	and	images using	containers.	We	will	discuss	three	of	the	most	popular patterns	here:  All-in-One—	You	use	an	all-in-one	image	to	build	and	run	the application.  Build	Plus	Runtime—	You	use	a	build	image	with	a	separate,	slimmer runtime	image	to	build	a	containerized	application.  Build	Plus	Multiple	Runtimes—	You	use	a	slim	runtime	image	with variations	for	debugging	and	other	supplemental	use	cases	in	a	multi-stage build.  Figure	10.3.	Image	build	pattern	maturity  Multiple	build	patterns	have	evolved	to	produce	images appropriate	for	particular	consumption	use	cases.	In	this context,	maturity	refers	to	the	design	and	process	used	to	build the	image,	not	the	organization	applying	the	pattern.	When	an image	will	be	used	for	internal	experimentation	or	as	a portable	development	environment,	the	All-in-One	pattern might	be	most	appropriate.	By	contrast,	when	distributing	a server	that	will	be	licensed	and	supported	commercially,	the   Build	Plus	Runtime	pattern	will	probably	be	most	appropriate. A	single	software	publishing	organization	will	often	use multiple	patterns	for	building	images	that	they	use	and distribute.	Apply	and	modify	the	patterns	described	here	to solve	your	own	image	build	and	delivery	problems.  10.2.1.	All-in-one	images  All-in-one	images	include	all	the	tools	required	to	build	and run	an	application.	These	tools	might	include	software development	kits	 SDKs ,	package	managers,	shared	libraries, language-specific	build	tooling,	or	other	binary	tools.	This type	of	image	will	also	commonly	include	default	application runtime	configuration.	All-in-one	images	are	the	simplest	way to	get	started	containerizing	an	application.	They	are especially	useful	when	containerizing	a	development environment	or	“legacy”	application	that	has	many dependencies.  Let’s	use	the	All-in-One	pattern	to	build	a	simple	Java	web server	using	the	popular	Spring	Boot	framework.	Here	is	an all-in-one	Dockerfile	that	builds	the	application	into	an	image along	with	the	build	tools:  FROM	maven:3.6-jdk-11 	 ENV	WORKDIR= project RUN	mkdir	-p	${WORKDIR} COPY	.	${WORKDIR} WORKDIR	${WORKDIR} RUN	mvn	-f	pom.xml	clean	verify RUN	cp	${WORKDIR} target ch10-0.1.0.jar	 app.jar 	 ENTRYPOINT	["java","-jar"," app.jar"]   Clone	the	https:  github.com dockerinaction ch10_patterns- for-building-images.git	repo	and	build	the	project	as	follows:  docker	image	build	-t	dockerinaction ch10:all-in-one	\ 				--file	all-in-one.df	.  In	this	Dockerfile,	the	source	image	is	the	community	Maven 3.6	image,	which	also	includes	OpenJDK	11.	The	Dockerfile builds	a	simple	Java	web	server,	and	the	application	artifact	is added	to	the	image.	The	image	definition	finishes	with	an ENTRYPOINT	that	runs	the	service	by	invoking	java	with the	application	artifact	built	in	the	image.	This	is	about	the simplest	thing	that	could	possibly	work	and	a	great	approach for	demonstrating,	“Look,	we	can	containerize	our application!”  All-in-one	images	have	downsides.	Because	they	contain	more tools	than	are	necessary	to	run	the	application,	attackers	have more	options	to	exploit	an	application,	and	images	may	need to	update	more	frequently	to	accommodate	change	from	a broad	set	of	development	and	operational	requirements.	In addition,	all-in-one	images	will	be	large,	often	500	MB	or more.	The	maven:3.6-jdk-11	base	image	used	in	the example	is	614	MB	to	start	with,	and	the	final	image	is	708 MB.	Large	images	put	more	stress	on	image	distribution mechanisms,	though	this	problem	is	relatively	innocuous	until you	get	to	large-scale	or	very	frequent	releases.  This	approach	is	good	for	creating	a	portable	application image	or	development	environment	with	little	effort.	The	next pattern	will	show	how	to	improve	many	characteristics	of	the   runtime	image	by	separating	application	build	and	runtime concerns.  10.2.2.	Separate	build	and	runtime	images  The	All-in-One	pattern	can	be	improved	by	creating	separate build	and	runtime	images.	Specifically,	in	this	approach,	all	of the	application	build	and	test	tooling	will	be	included	in	one image,	and	the	other	will	contain	only	what	the	application requires	at	runtime.  You	can	build	the	application	with	a	Maven	container:  docker	container	run	-it	--rm	\ 		-v	"$ pwd ": project 	\ 		-w	 project 	\ 		maven:3.6-jdk-11	\ 		mvn	clean	verify  Maven	compiles	and	packages	the	application	artifact	into	the project’s	target	directory:  $	ls	-la	target ch10-0.1.0.jar -rw-r--r--		1	user		group		16142344	Jul		2	15:17	target ch10- 0.1.0.jar  In	this	approach,	the	application	is	built	using	a	container created	from	the	public	Maven	image.	The	application	artifact is	output	to	the	host	filesystem	via	the	volume	mount	instead of	storing	it	in	the	build	image	as	in	the	All-in-One	pattern. The	runtime	image	is	created	using	a	simple	Dockerfile	that COPYs	the	application	artifact	into	an	image	based	on OpenJDK	10:   FROM	openjdk:11-jdk-slim 	 COPY	target ch10-0.1.0.jar	 app.jar 	 ENTRYPOINT	["java","-jar"," app.jar"]  Build	the	runtime	image:  docker	image	build	-t	dockerinaction ch10:simple-runtime	\ 				--file	simple-runtime.df	.  Now	run	the	web	server	image:  docker	container	run	--rm	-it	-p	8080:8080 dockerinaction ch10:simple-runtime  The	application	runs	just	as	it	did	in	the	previous	all-in-one example.	With	this	approach,	the	build-specific	tools	such	as Maven	and	intermediate	artifacts	are	no	longer	included	in	the runtime	image.	The	runtime	image	is	now	much	smaller	 401 MB	versus	708	MB! 	and	has	a	smaller	attack	surface.  This	pattern	is	now	supported	and	encouraged	by	many	CI tools.	The	support	usually	comes	in	the	ability	to	specify	a Docker	image	to	use	as	a	hygienic	execution	environment	for a	step	or	the	ability	to	run	containerized	build	agents	and assign	steps	to	them.  10.2.3.	Variations	of	runtime	image	via	multi-stage	builds  As	your	build	and	operational	experience	matures,	you	may find	it	useful	to	create	small	variations	of	an	application	image to	support	use	cases	such	as	debugging,	specialized	testing,	or   profiling.	These	use	cases	often	require	adding	specialized tools	or	changing	the	application’s	image.	Multi-stage	builds can	be	used	to	keep	the	specialized	image	synchronized	with the	application	image	and	avoid	duplication	of	image definitions.	In	this	section,	we	will	focus	on	the	Build	Plus Multiple	Runtimes	pattern	of	creating	specialized	images	by using	the	multi-stage	features	of	the	FROM	instruction introduced	in	chapter	8.  Let’s	build	a	debug	variation	of	our	app-image	based	on	our application	image.	The	hierarchy	will	look	like	figure	10.4.  Figure	10.4.	Image	hierarchy	for	multi-stage	build	example  The	multi-stage-runtime.df	in	the	chapter’s	example	repository implements	this	hierarchy:   	The	app-image	build	target	defines	the	application	image FROM	openjdk:11-jdk-slim	as	app-image																								1  ARG	BUILD_ID=unknown ARG	BUILD_DATE=unknown ARG	VCS_REF=unknown  LABEL	org.label-schema.version="${BUILD_ID}"	\ 						org.label-schema.build-date="${BUILD_DATE}"	\ 						org.label-schema.vcs-ref="${VCS_REF}"	\  						org.label-schema.name="ch10"	\ 						org.label-schema.schema-version="1.0rc1"  COPY	multi-stage-runtime.df	 Dockerfile  COPY	target ch10-0.1.0.jar	 app.jar  ENTRYPOINT	["java","-jar"," app.jar"]  FROM	app-image	as	app-image-debug																										2 COPY	needed	debugging	tools	into	image ENTRYPOINT	["sh"]  FROM	app-image	as	default																																		3  1	app-image	build	stage	starts	from	openjdk.  2	app-image-debug	stage	inherits	and	adds	to	the	app-image.  3	default	stage	ensures	app-image	is	produced	by	default.  The	build	stage	of	the	main	application	image	is	declared	as starting	from	openjdk:11-jdk-slim	and	named	app- image:  	The	app-image	build	target	defines	the	application	image FROM	openjdk:11-jdk-slim	as	app-image …  Naming	a	build	stage	serves	two	important	purposes.	First,	the stage	name	enables	other	build	stages	within	the	Dockerfile	to use	another	stage	easily.	Second,	build	processes	can	build	a   stage	by	specifying	that	name	as	a	build	target.	Build	stage names	are	localized	to	the	context	of	a	Dockerfile	and	do	not affect	image	tagging.  Let’s	define	a	variation	of	the	application	image	by	adding	a build	stage	to	the	Dockerfile	that	supports	debugging:  FROM	app-image	as	app-image-debug										1 COPY	needed	debugging	tools	into	image ENTRYPOINT	["sh"]  1	Uses	app-image	as	the	base	for	the	debug	image  The	debug	application	image	definition	specifies	app-image as	its	base	image	and	demonstrates	making	minor	changes.	In this	case,	the	only	change	is	to	reconfigure	the	image’s entrypoint	to	be	a	shell	instead	of	running	the	application.	The debug	image	is	otherwise	identical	to	the	main	application image.  The	docker	image	build	command	produces	a	single image	regardless	of	how	many	stages	are	defined	in	the Dockerfile.	You	can	use	the	build	command’s	--target option	to	select	the	stage	to	build	the	image.	When	you	define multiple	build	stages	in	a	Dockerfile,	it	is	best	to	be	explicit about	what	image	you	want	to	build.	To	build	the	debug image,	invoke	docker	build	and	target	the	app-image- debug	stage:  docker	image	build	-t	dockerinaction ch10:multi-stage-runtime- debug	\ 				-f	multi-stage-runtime.df	\ 				--target=app-image-debug	.   The	build	process	will	execute	the	app-image-debug	stage as	well	as	the	app-image	stage	it	depends	on	to	produce	the debug	image.  Note	that	when	you	build	an	image	from	a	Dockerfile	that defines	multiple	stages	and	do	not	specify	a	build	target, Docker	will	build	an	image	from	the	last	stage	defined	in	the Dockerfile.	You	can	build	an	image	for	the	main	build	stage defined	in	your	Dockerfile	by	adding	a	trivial	build	stage	at	the end	of	the	Dockerfile:  	Ensure	app-image	is	the	default	image	built	with	this Dockerfile FROM	app-image	as	default  This	FROM	statement	defines	a	new	build	stage	named default	that	is	based	on	app-image.	The	default	stage makes	no	additions	to	the	last	layer	produced	by	app-image and	is	thus	identical.  Now	that	we	have	covered	several	patterns	for	producing	an image	or	family	of	closely	related	images,	let’s	discuss	what metadata	we	should	capture	along	with	our	images	to	facilitate delivery	and	operational	processes.   10.3.	RECORD	METADATA	AT	IMAGE	BUILD	TIME  As	described	in	chapter	8,	images	can	be	annotated	with metadata	that	is	useful	to	consumers	and	operators	via	the LABEL	instruction.	You	should	use	labels	to	capture	at	least the	following	data	in	your	images:  Application	name  Application	version  Build	date	and	time  Version-control	commit	identifier  In	addition	to	image	labels,	consider	adding	the	Dockerfile used	to	build	the	image	and	software	package	manifests	to	the image	filesystem.  All	this	information	is	highly	valuable	when	orchestrating deployments	and	debugging	problems.	Orchestrators	can provide	traceability	by	logging	metadata	to	audit	logs. Deployment	tools	can	visualize	the	composition	of	a	service deployment	using	the	build	time	or	version-control	system  VCS 	commit	identifier.	Including	the	source	Dockerfile	in the	image	can	be	a	quick	reference	for	people	debugging	a problem	to	navigate	within	a	container.	Orchestrators	and security	tools	may	find	other	metadata	describing	the	image’s architectural	role	or	security	profile	useful	in	deciding	where the	container	should	run	or	what	it	is	permitted	to	do.  The	Docker	community	Label	Schema	project	has	defined   commonly	used	labels	at	http:  label-schema.org . Representing	the	recommended	metadata	by	using	the	label schema	and	build	arguments	in	Dockerfile	looks	like	the following:  FROM	openjdk:11-jdk-slim  ARG	BUILD_ID=unknown ARG	BUILD_DATE=unknown ARG	VCS_REF=unknown  LABEL	org.label-schema.version="${BUILD_ID}"	\ 						org.label-schema.build-date="${BUILD_DATE}"	\ 						org.label-schema.vcs-ref="${VCS_REF}"	\ 						org.label-schema.name="ch10"	\ 						org.label-schema.schema-version="1.0rc1"  COPY	multi-stage-runtime.df	 Dockerfile  COPY	target ch10-0.1.0.jar	 app.jar  ENTRYPOINT	["java","-jar"," app.jar"]  Our	build	process	is	more	complicated	now	that	we	have	more steps:	gather	metadata,	build	application	artifacts,	build	image. Let’s	orchestrate	the	build	process	with	a	time-tested	build tool,	make.  10.3.1.	Orchestrating	the	build	with	make  make,	a	widely	available	tool	used	to	build	programs, understands	dependencies	between	the	steps	of	a	build process.	Build	process	authors	describe	each	step	in	a Makefile	that	make	interprets	and	executes	to	complete	the build.	The	make	tool	provides	a	flexible	shell-like	execution environment,	so	you	can	implement	virtually	any	kind	of	build step.   The	primary	advantage	of	make	over	a	standard	shell	script	is that	users	declare	dependencies	between	steps	rather	than directly	implementing	the	flow	of	control	between	steps. These	steps	are	called	rules,	and	each	rule	is	identified	by	a target	name.	Here	is	the	general	form	of	a	make	rule:  target	…	:	prerequisites	…					12 								recipe	command	1							3 								recipe	command	2 								…  1	target	identifies	the	rule	with	a	logical	name	or	filename	produced by	the	rule.  2	prerequisites	is	an	optional	list	of	targets	to	build	before	this	target.  3	The	recipe	section	contains	the	list	of	commands	used	to	build	the target.  When	you	run	the	make	command,	it	constructs	a	dependency graph	from	the	prerequisites	declared	for	each	rule.	The command	uses	this	graph	to	calculate	the	sequence	of	steps	to build	a	specified	target.	make	has	many	features	and	quirks that	we	will	not	describe	here,	but	you	can	read	more	about	it at	https:  www.gnu.org software make manual .	One	item	of note	is	that	make	is	famous	for	its	sensitivity	to	whitespace characters,	particularly	tabs	for	indentation	and	spaces	around variable	declarations.	You	will	probably	find	it	easiest	to	use the	Makefile	provided	in	this	chapter’s	source	repository  https:  github.com dockerinaction ch10_patterns-for-building- images.git 	instead	of	typing	them	in	yourself.	With	our	make primer	complete,	let’s	return	to	building	our	Docker	images.  Building	on	Windows   If	you	are	using	Windows,	you	will	probably	find	that	make and	several	other	commands	used	in	this	example	are	not available	in	your	environment.	The	easiest	solution	will probably	be	to	use	a	Linux	virtual	machine	either	locally	or	in the	cloud.	If	you	plan	to	develop	software	by	using	Docker	on Windows,	you	should	also	investigate	using	the	Windows Subsystem	for	Linux	 WSL	or	WSL2 	with	Docker	for Windows.  Here	is	a	Makefile	that	will	gather	metadata,	and	then	build, test,	and	tag	the	application	artifact	and	images:  	if	BUILD_ID	is	unset,	compute	metadata	that	will	be	used	in	 builds ifeq	 $ strip	$ BUILD_ID  ,  				VCS_REF	:=	$ shell	git	rev-parse	--short	HEAD  				BUILD_TIME_EPOCH	:=	$ shell	date	+"%s"  				BUILD_TIME_RFC_3339	:=	\ 												$ shell	date	-u	-r	$ BUILD_TIME_EPOCH 	 '+%Y-%m-%dT%I:%M:%SZ'  				BUILD_TIME_UTC	:=	\ 												$ shell	date	-u	-r	$ BUILD_TIME_EPOCH 	 +'%Y%m%d-%H%M%S'  				BUILD_ID	:=	$ BUILD_TIME_UTC -$ VCS_REF  endif  ifeq	 $ strip	$ TAG  ,  				TAG	:=	unknown endif  .PHONY:	clean clean: 				@echo	"Cleaning" 				rm	-rf	target  .PHONY:	metadata metadata: 				@echo	"Gathering	Metadata" 				@echo	BUILD_TIME_EPOCH	IS	$ BUILD_TIME_EPOCH  				@echo	BUILD_TIME_RFC_3339	IS	$ BUILD_TIME_RFC_3339  				@echo	BUILD_TIME_UTC	IS	$ BUILD_TIME_UTC    				@echo	BUILD_ID	IS	$ BUILD_ID   target ch10-0.1.0.jar: 				@echo	"Building	App	Artifacts" 				docker	run	-it	--rm		-v	"$ shell	pwd ": project 	-w	  project 	\ 				maven:3.6-jdk-11	\ 				mvn	clean	verify  .PHONY:	app-artifacts app-artifacts:	target ch10-0.1.0.jar  .PHONY:	lint-dockerfile lint-dockerfile: 				@set	-e 				@echo	"Linting	Dockerfile" 				docker	container	run	--rm	-i	hadolint hadolint:v1.15.0	<	\ 												multi-stage-runtime.df  .PHONY:	app-image app-image:	app-artifacts	metadata	lint-dockerfile										1 				@echo	"Building	App	Image" 				docker	image	build	-t	dockerinaction ch10:$ BUILD_ID 	\ 				-f	multi-stage-runtime.df	\ 				--build-arg	BUILD_ID='$ BUILD_ID '	\ 				--build-arg	BUILD_DATE='$ BUILD_TIME_RFC_3339 '	\ 				--build-arg	VCS_REF='$ VCS_REF '	\ 				. 				@echo	"Built	App	Image.

This	Makefile	defines	a	target	for	each	build	step	we	have discussed:	gathering	metadata,	building	the	application,	and building,	testing,	and	tagging	the	image.	Targets	such	as	app- image	have	dependencies	on	other	targets	to	ensure	that	steps execute	in	the	right	order.	Because	build	metadata	is	essential for	all	steps,	it	is	generated	automatically	unless	a	BUILD_ID is	provided.	The	Makefile	implements	an	image	pipeline	that you	can	run	locally	or	use	within	a	continuous	integration	or continuous	delivery	 CD 	system.	You	can	build	the application	artifacts	and	image	by	making	the	app-image target:  make	app-image  Making	the	application	artifacts	will	produce	a	lot	of	output	as dependencies	are	retrieved	and	then	code	compiled.	However, the	application	build	should	indicate	success	with	a	message   like	this:  [INFO]	-------------------------------------------------------- ---------- [INFO]	BUILD	SUCCESS [INFO]	-------------------------------------------------------- ----------  Immediately	following	that,	you	should	see	a	Gathering Metadata	message	followed	by	metadata	for	this	build:  BUILD_TIME_EPOCH	IS	1562106748 BUILD_TIME_RFC_3339	IS	2019-07-02T10:32:28Z BUILD_TIME_UTC	IS	20190702-223228 BUILD_ID	IS	20190702-223228-ade3d65  The	next	step	in	the	build	process	is	the	first	quality-assurance step	for	our	image.	You	should	see	a	message	like	this:  Linting	Dockerfile docker	container	run	--rm	-i	hadolint hadolint:v1.15.0	<	multi- stage- 					runtime.df  Before	building	the	image,	the	Dockerfile	is	analyzed	by	a linting	tool	named	hadolint  https:  github.com hadolint hadolint .	The	linter	checks Dockerfiles	to	verify	that	they	follow	best	practices	and identify	common	mistakes.	As	with	other	quality-assurance practices,	you	may	choose	to	stop	the	image	build	pipeline when	a	linter	reports	a	problem.	Hadolint	is	one	of	several linters	available	for	Dockerfiles.	Because	it	parses	the Dockerfile	into	an	abstract	syntax	tree,	it’s	able	to	perform deeper	and	more	complex	analysis	than	approaches	based	on regular	expressions.	Hadolint	identifies	incorrectly	specified	or   deprecated	Dockerfile	instructions,	omitting	a	tag	in	the	FROM image	instruction,	common	mistakes	when	using	apt,	apk, pip,	and	npm	package	managers,	and	other	commands specified	in	RUN	instructions.  Once	the	Dockerfile	has	been	linted,	the	app-image	target executes	and	builds	the	application	image.	The	docker image	build	command	should	indicate	success	with	output similar	to	the	following:  Successfully	built	79b61fb87b96 Successfully	tagged	dockerinaction ch10:20190702-223619-ade3d65 Built	App	Image.	BUILD_ID:	20190702-223619-ade3d65  In	this	build	process,	each	application	image	is	tagged	with	a BUILD_ID	computed	from	the	time	of	the	build	and	the current	Git	commit	hash.	The	fresh	Docker	image	is	tagged with	the	repository	and	BUILD_ID,	20190702-223619- ade3d65	in	this	case.	The	20190702-223619-ade3d65 tag	now	identifies	Docker	image	ID	79b61fb87b96	in	the dockerinaction ch10	image	repository.	This	style	of BUILD_ID	identifies	the	image	with	a	high	degree	of precision	in	both	wall	clock	time	and	version	history. Capturing	the	time	of	an	image	build	is	an	important	practice because	people	understand	time	well,	and	many	image	builds will	perform	software	package	manager	updates	or	other operations	that	may	not	produce	the	same	result	from	build	to build.	Including	the	version	control	ID,	7c5fd3d,	provides	a convenient	pointer	back	to	the	original	source	material	used	to build	the	image.   The	steps	that	follow	will	make	use	of	the	BUILD_ID.	You can	make	the	BUILD_ID	easily	accessible	by	copying	it	from the	last	line	of	the	app-image	build	step	output	in	your terminal	and	exporting	it	as	a	variable	in	your	shell:  export	BUILD_ID=20190702-223619-ade3d65  You	can	inspect	the	metadata	that	was	added	to	the	image	by inspecting	the	labels	via	this	command:  make	inspect-image-labels	BUILD_ID=20190702-223619-ade3d65  Or	you	can	use	the	following	if	you	exported	the	BUILD_ID tag:  make	inspect-image-labels	BUILD_ID=$BUILD_ID  This	command	uses	docker	image	inspect	to	show	the image’s	labels:  { 		"org.label-schema.build-date":	"2019-07-02T10:36:19Z", 		"org.label-schema.name":	"ch10", 		"org.label-schema.schema-version":	"1.0rc1", 		"org.label-schema.vcs-ref":	"ade3d65", 		"org.label-schema.version":	"20190702-223619-ade3d65" }  The	application	image	is	now	ready	for	further	testing	and tagging	prior	to	release.	The	image	has	a	unique	BUILD_ID tag	that	will	conveniently	identify	the	image	through	the	rest of	the	delivery	process.	In	the	next	section,	we	will	examine ways	to	test	that	an	image	has	been	constructed	correctly	and   is	ready	for	deployment.   10.4.	TESTING	IMAGES	IN	A	BUILD	PIPELINE  Image	publishers	can	use	several	techniques	in	their	build pipelines	to	build	confidence	in	the	produced	artifacts.	The Dockerfile	linting	step	described	in	the	previous	section	is	one quality-assurance	technique,	but	we	can	go	further.  One	of	the	principal	advantages	of	the	Docker	image	format	is that	image	metadata	and	the	filesystem	can	be	easily	analyzed by	tools.	For	example,	the	image	can	be	tested	to	verify	it contains	files	required	by	the	application,	those	files	have appropriate	permissions,	and	by	executing	key	programs	to verify	that	they	run	correctly.	Docker	images	can	be	inspected to	verify	that	traceability	and	deployment	metadata	has	been added.	Security-conscious	users	can	scan	the	image	for vulnerabilities.	Publishers	can	stop	the	image	delivery	process if	any	of	these	steps	fail,	and	together	these	steps	raise	the quality	of	published	images	significantly.  One	popular	tool	for	verifying	the	construction	of	a	Docker image	is	the	Container	Structure	Test	tool	 CST 	from	Google  https:  github.com GoogleContainerTools container-structure- test .	With	this	tool,	authors	can	verify	that	an	image	 or	image tarball 	contains	files	with	desired	file	permissions	and ownership,	commands	execute	with	expected	output,	and	the image	contains	particular	metadata	such	as	a	label	or command.	Many	of	these	inspections	could	be	done	by	a traditional	system	configuration	inspection	tool	such	as	Chef Inspec	or	Serverspec.	However,	CST’s	approach	is	more   appropriate	for	containers,	as	the	tool	operates	on	arbitrary images	without	requiring	any	tooling	or	libraries	to	be included	inside	the	image.	Let’s	verify	that	the	application artifact	has	the	proper	permissions	and	that	the	proper	version of	Java	is	installed	by	executing	CST	with	the	following configuration:  schemaVersion:	"2.0.0" 	 	Verify	the	expected	version	of	Java	is	available	and executable commandTests: 		-	name:	"java	version" 				command:	"java" 				args:	["-version"] 				exitCode:	0 					OpenJDK	java	-version	stderr	will	include	a	line	like: 					OpenJDK	Runtime	Environment	18.9	 build	11.0.3+7  				expectedError:	["OpenJDK	Runtime	Environment.*build 11\\..*"] 	 	 	Verify	the	application	archive	is	readable	and	owned	by	root fileExistenceTests: -	name:	'application	archive' 		path:	' app.jar' 		shouldExist:	true 		permissions:	'-rw-r--r--' 		uid:	0 		gid:	0  First,	this	configuration	tells	CST	to	invoke	Java	and	output the	version	information.	The	OpenJDK	Java	runtime	prints	its version	information	to	stderr,	so	CST	is	configured	to	match that	string	against	the	OpenJDK	Runtime Environment.*build	11\..*	regular	expression.	If you	needed	to	ensure	that	the	application	runs	against	a specific	version	of	Java,	the	regex	could	be	made	more specific	and	the	base	image	updated	to	match.   Second,	CST	will	verify	that	the	application	archive	is	at  app.jar,	owned	by	root,	and	readable	by	everyone.	Verifying file	ownership	and	permissions	might	seem	basic	but	helps prevent	problems	with	bugs	that	are	“invisible”	because programs	aren’t	executable,	readable,	or	in	the	executable PATH.	Execute	the	image	tests	against	the	image	you	built earlier	with	the	following	command:  make	image-tests	BUILD_ID=$BUILD_ID  This	command	should	produce	a	successful	result:  Testing	image	structure docker	container	run	--rm	-it	\ 				-v	 var run docker.sock: var run docker.sock	\ 				-v	 Users dia structure-tests.yaml: structure-tests.yaml	\ 				gcr.io gcp-runtimes container-structure-test:v1.6.0	test	\ 				--image	dockerinaction ch10:20181230-181226-61ceb6d	\ 				--config	 structure-tests.yaml 	 ============================================= ======	Test	file:	structure-tests.yaml	====== ============================================= 	 INFO:	stderr:	openjdk	version	"11.0.3"	2019-04-16 OpenJDK	Runtime	Environment	18.9	 build	11.0.3+7  OpenJDK	64-Bit	Server	VM	18.9	 build	11.0.3+7,	mixed	mode  	 ===	RUN:	Command	Test:	java	version ---	PASS stderr:	openjdk	version	"11.0.3"	2019-04-16 OpenJDK	Runtime	Environment	18.9	 build	11.0.3+7  OpenJDK	64-Bit	Server	VM	18.9	 build	11.0.3+7,	mixed	mode  INFO:	File	Existence	Test:	application	archive ===	RUN:	File	Existence	Test:	application	archive ---	PASS 	 ============================================= ==================	RESULTS	================== ============================================= Passes:						2 Failures:				0 Total	tests:	2 	 PASS   PASS  Many	image	authors	want	to	scan	images	for	vulnerabilities prior	to	publishing	them	and	halt	the	delivery	process	when	a significant	vulnerability	exists.	We	will	give	a	quick	overview of	how	these	systems	work	and	how	they	are	typically integrated	into	an	image	build	pipeline.	Several	image vulnerability	scanning	solutions	are	available	from	both commercial	and	community	sources.  In	general,	image	vulnerability	scanning	solutions	rely	on	a lightweight	scanning	client	program	that	runs	in	the	image build	pipeline.	The	scanning	client	examines	the	contents	of the	image	and	compares	the	software	package	metadata	and file-system	contents	to	vulnerability	data	retrieved	from	a centralized	vulnerability	database	or	API.	Most	of	these scanning	systems	require	registration	with	the	vendor	to	use the	service,	so	we	will	not	integrate	any	of	the	tools	into	this image	build	workflow.	After	choosing	an	image-scanning	tool, it	should	be	easy	to	add	another	target	to	the	build	process.  Features	of	a	general	vulnerability	scanning	and	remediation	workflow  Using	a	scanner	to	identify	vulnerabilities	in	a	single	image	is the	first	and	most	critical	step	in	publishing	images	without vulnerabilities.	The	leading	container	security	systems	cover	a wider	set	of	scanning	and	remediation	use	cases	than	discussed in	the	image	build	pipeline	example.  These	systems	incorporate	vulnerability	feeds	with	low	false- positive	rates,	integrate	with	the	organization’s	Docker   registries	to	identify	issues	in	images	that	have	already	been published	or	were	built	by	an	external	source,	and	notify maintainers	of	the	base	image	or	layer	with	a	vulnerability	to speed	remediation.	When	evaluating	container	security systems,	pay	special	attention	to	these	features	and	the	way each	solution	will	integrate	with	your	delivery	and	operational processes.   10.5.	PATTERNS	FOR	TAGGING	IMAGES  Once	an	image	has	been	tested	and	is	deemed	ready	for deployment	in	the	next	stage	of	delivery,	the	image	should	be tagged	so	that	it	is	easy	for	consumers	to	find	and	use	it. Several	schemes	for	tagging	images	exist,	and	some	are	better for	certain	consumption	patterns	than	others.	The	most important	image-tagging	features	to	understand	are	as	follows:  Tags	are	human-readable	strings	that	point	to	a	particular	content- addressable	image	ID.  Multiple	tags	may	point	to	a	single	image	ID.  Tags	are	mutable	and	may	be	moved	between	images	in	a	repository	or removed	entirely.  You	can	use	all	of	these	features	to	construct	a	scheme	that works	for	an	organization,	but	there	is	not	a	single	scheme	in use	or	only	a	single	way	to	do	it.	Certain	tagging	schemes	will work	well	for	certain	consumption	patterns	and	not	others.  10.5.1.	Background  Docker	image	tags	are	mutable.	An	image	repository	owner can	remove	a	tag	from	an	image	ID	or	move	it	from	one	ID	to another.	Image	tag	mutation	is	commonly	used	to	identify	the latest	image	in	a	series.	The	latest	tag	is	used	extensively within	the	Docker	community	to	identify	the	most	recent	build of	an	image	repository.  However,	the	latest	tag	causes	a	lot	of	confusion	because   there	is	no	real	agreement	on	what	it	means.	Depending	on	the image	repository	or	organization,	any	of	the	following	are valid	answers	to	“What	does	the	latest	tag	identify?”  The	most	recent	image	built	by	the	CI	system,	regardless	of	source	control branch  The	most	recent	image	built	by	the	CI	system,	from	the	main	release branch  The	most	recent	image	built	from	the	stable	release	branch	that	has	passed all	the	author’s	tests  The	most	recent	image	built	from	an	active	development	branch	that	has passed	all	the	author’s	tests  Nothing!	Because	the	author	has	never	pushed	an	image	tagged	latest or	has	not	done	so	recently  Even	trying	to	define	latest	prompts	many	questions.	When adopting	an	image	release	tagging	scheme,	be	sure	to	specify what	the	tag	does	and	does	not	mean	in	your	own	context. Because	tags	can	be	mutated,	you	will	also	need	to	decide	if and	when	consumers	should	pull	images	to	receive	updates	to an	image	tag	that	already	exists	on	the	machine.  Common	tagging	and	deployment	schemes	include	the following:  Continuous	delivery	with	unique	tags—	Pipelines	promote	a	single	image with	a	unique	tag	through	delivery	stages.  Continuous	delivery	with	environment-specific	artifacts—	Pipelines produce	environment-specific	artifacts	and	promote	them	through development,	stage,	and	production.  Semantic	versioning—	Tag	and	publish	images	with	a Major.Minor.Patch	scheme	that	communicates	the	level	of	change in	a	release.   10.5.2.	Continuous	delivery	with	unique	tags  The	Unique	Tags	scheme,	illustrated	in	figure	10.5,	is	a common	and	simple	way	to	support	continuous	delivery	of	an application.	In	this	scheme,	the	image	is	built	and	deployed into	an	environment	by	using	the	unique	BUILD_ID	tag. When	people	or	automation	decide	that	this	version	of	the application	is	ready	for	promotion	to	the	next	environment, they	run	a	deployment	to	that	environment	with	the	unique	tag.  Figure	10.5.	Continuous	delivery	with	unique	tags  This	scheme	is	simple	to	implement	and	supports	continuous delivery	of	applications	that	use	a	linear	release	model	without branching.	The	main	disadvantage	of	this	scheme	is	that people	must	deal	with	precise	build	identifiers	instead	of	being able	to	use	a	latest	or	a	dev	tag.	Because	an	image	may	be tagged	multiple	times,	many	teams	apply	and	publish additional	tags	such	as	latest	to	provide	a	convenient	way to	consume	the	most	recent	image.  10.5.3.	Configuration	image	per	deployment	stage  Some	organizations	package	software	releases	into	a	distinct artifact	for	each	stage	of	deployment.	These	packages	are	then deployed	to	dedicated	internal	environments	for	integration   testing	and	have	names	such	as	dev	and	stage.	Once	the software	has	been	tested	in	internal	environments,	the production	package	is	deployed	to	the	production environment.	We	could	create	a	Docker	image	for	each environment.	Each	image	would	include	both	the	application artifact	and	environment-specific	configuration.	However,	this is	an	antipattern	because	the	main	deployment	artifact	is	built multiple	times	and	is	usually	not	tested	prior	to	production.  A	better	way	to	support	deployment	to	multiple	environments is	to	create	two	kinds	of	images:  A	generic,	environment-agnostic	application	image  A	set	of	environment-specific	configuration	images,	with	each	image containing	the	environment-specific	configuration	files	for	that environment  Figure	10.6.	Configuration	image	per	environment  The	generic	application	and	environment-specific   configuration	images	should	be	built	at	the	same	time	and tagged	with	the	same	BUILD_ID.	The	deployment	process identifies	the	software	and	configuration	for	deployment	by using	the	BUILD_ID	as	described	in	the	continuous	delivery case.	At	deployment	time,	two	containers	are	created.	First,	a configuration	container	is	created	from	the	environment- specific	configuration	image.	Second,	the	application container	is	created	from	the	generic	application	image,	and that	container	mounts	the	config	container’s	filesystem	as	a volume.  Consuming	environment-specific	files	from	a	config container’s	filesystem	is	a	popular	application	orchestration pattern	and	a	variation	of	12-factor	application	principles  https:  12factor.net  .	In	chapter	12,	you	will	see	how	Docker supports	environment-specific	configuration	of	services	as	a first-class	feature	of	orchestration	without	using	a	secondary image.  This	approach	enables	software	authors	and	operators	to support	environment-specific	variation	while	maintaining traceability	back	to	the	originating	sources	and	preserving	a simple	deployment	workflow.  10.5.4.	Semantic	versioning  Semantic	versioning	 https:  semver.org  	is	a	popular approach	to	versioning	artifacts	with	a	version	number	of	the form	Major.Minor.Patch.	The	semantic	versioning specification	defines	that	as	software	changes,	authors	should increment	the	following:   1.	 Major	version	when	making	incompatible	API	changes 2.	 Minor	version	when	adding	functionality	in	a	backward-compatible  manner  3.	 Patch	version	when	making	backward-compatible	bug	fixes  Semantic	versioning	helps	both	publishers	and	consumers manage	expectations	for	the	kind	of	changes	a	consumer	is getting	when	updating	an	image	dependency.	Authors	who publish	images	to	a	large	number	of	consumers	or	who	must maintain	several	release	streams	for	a	long	time	often	find semantic	versioning	or	a	similar	scheme	attractive.	Semantic versioning	is	a	good	choice	for	images	that	many	people depend	on	as	a	base	operating	system,	language	runtime,	or database.  Figure	10.7.	Tag	and	publish	image	release	with	semantic	versioning  Suppose	that	after	testing	your	image	in	dev	and	stage	that you	want	to	release	your	recent	build	of	the	example	app	as version	1.0.0	to	your	customers.	You	can	use	BUILD_ID	to identify	the	image	and	tag	it	with	1.0.0:  make	tag	BUILD_ID=$BUILD_ID	TAG=1.0.0  Tagging	the	image	as	version	1.0.0	signals	that	you	are   ready	to	maintain	backward	compatibility	in	the	operation	of the	software.	Now	that	you	have	tagged	the	image,	you	can push	it	to	a	registry	for	distribution.	You	may	even	choose	to publish	to	multiple	registries.	Use	multiple	registries	to	keep images	intended	for	internal	use	private	and	publish	only official	releases	to	the	public	registry	for	consumption	by customers.  No	matter	what	the	scheme	for	identifying	an	image	to promote,	once	the	decision	to	promote	the	image	is	made,	a promotion	pipeline	should	resolve	semantic	tags	 latest, dev,	7 	to	a	unique	tag	or	content-addressable	identifier	and deploy	that	image.	This	ensures	that	if	the	tag	being	promoted is	moved	to	another	image	in	the	meantime,	the	image	that people	decided	to	promote	is	deployed	instead	of	merely whatever	image	the	tag	is	associated	with	at	the	time	of deployment.   SUMMARY  This	chapter	covered	common	goals,	patterns,	and	techniques used	to	build	and	publish	applications	in	Docker	images.	The options	described	in	this	chapter	illustrate	the	range	of	options available	when	creating	image	delivery	processes.	With	this foundation,	you	should	be	able	to	navigate,	select,	and customize	options	that	are	appropriate	for	delivering	your	own applications	as	Docker	images.	The	key	points	to	understand from	this	chapter	are:  Pipelines	for	building	images	have	the	same	structure	and	goals	for ensuring	quality	of	Docker	images	as	other	software	and	infrastructure build	pipelines.  Tools	for	detecting	bugs,	security	problems,	and	other	image	construction problems	exist	and	can	easily	be	incorporated	into	image	build	pipelines.  Codify	the	image	build	process	by	using	a	build	tool	such	as	make	and	use that	process	in	local	development	and	CI CD	processes.  Several	patterns	exist	for	organizing	Docker	image	definitions.	These patterns	provide	trade-offs	in	managing	application	build	and	deployment concerns,	such	as	attack	surface	and	image	size	versus	sophistication.  Information	about	the	source	and	build	process	of	an	image	should	be recorded	as	image	metadata	to	support	traceability,	debugging,	and orchestration	activities	when	deploying	images.  Docker	image	tags	provide	a	foundation	for	delivering	software	to consumers	by	using	styles	ranging	from	continuous	delivery	in	a	private service	deployment	to	publishing	long-lived	releases	via	semantic versioning	to	the	public.   Part	3.	Higher-level	abstractions	and orchestration  This	part	focuses	on	managing	systems	of	components	by using	containers.	Most	valuable	systems	have	of	two	or	more components.	Managing	systems	with	a	small	number	of components	is	manageable	without	much	automation.	But achieving	consistency	and	repeatability	is	difficult	without automation	as	the	system	grows.  Managing	modern	service	architectures	is	complex	and requires	automated	tooling.	This	part	dives	into	higher-level abstractions	such	as	service,	environment,	and	configuration. You	will	learn	how	to	use	Docker	to	provide	that	automated tooling.   Chapter	11.	Services	with	Docker	and Compose  This	chapter	covers  Understanding	services	and	how	they	relate	to	containers  Basic	service	administration	with	Docker	Swarm  Building	declarative	environments	with	Docker	Compose	and	YAML  Iterating	projects	with	Compose	and	the	deploy	command  Scaling	services	and	cleaning	up  Today	most	of	the	software	we	run	is	designed	to	interact	with other	programs,	not	human	users.	The	resulting	webs	of interdependent	processes	serve	a	collective	purpose	such	as processing	payments,	running	games,	facilitating	global communications,	or	delivering	content.	When	you	look	closely at	that	web,	you’ll	find	individual	running	processes	that	might be	running	in	containers.	Those	processes	are	allocated memory	and	given	time	on	the	CPU.	They	are	bound	to	a network	and	listen	for	requests	from	other	programs	on specific	ports.	Their	network	interface	and	port	are	registered with	a	naming	system	so	they	are	discoverable	on	that network.	But	as	you	expand	your	view	and	examine	more processes,	you’ll	notice	that	most	of	them	share	common characteristics	and	goals.  Any	processes,	functionality,	or	data	that	must	be	discoverable and	available	over	a	network	is	called	a	service.	That	name, service,	is	an	abstraction.	By	encoding	those	goals	into	an   abstract	term,	we	simplify	how	we	talk	about	the	things	that use	this	pattern.	When	we	talk	about	a	specific	service,	we	do not	need	to	expressly	state	that	the	name	should	be discoverable	via	DNS	or	the	environment-appropriate	service- discovery	mechanism.	We	do	not	need	to	state	that	the	service should	be	running	when	a	client	needs	to	use	it.	Those expectations	are	already	communicated	by	common understanding	of	the	service	abstraction.	The	abstraction	lets us	focus	on	the	things	that	make	any	specific	service	special.  We	can	reflect	those	same	benefits	in	our	tooling.	Docker already	does	this	for	containers.	Containers	were	described	in chapter	6	as	processes	that	were	started	using	specific	Linux namespaces,	with	specific	filesystem	views,	and	resource allotments.	We	don’t	have	to	describe	those	specifics	each time	we	talk	about	a	container,	nor	do	we	have	to	do	the	work of	creating	those	namespaces	ourselves.	Docker	does	this	for us.	Docker	provides	tooling	for	other	abstractions	as	well, including	service.  This	chapter	introduces	the	basic	tooling	that	Docker	provides for	working	with	services	in	swarm	mode.	It	covers	the	service life	cycle,	the	role	of	an	orchestrator,	and	how	to	interact	with that	orchestrator	to	deploy	and	manage	services	on	your machine.	You	will	use	the	tools	described	in	this	chapter throughout	the	remainder	of	the	book.	The	same	concepts, problems,	and	fundamental	tooling	are	provided	by	all	of	the container	orchestration	systems	including	Kubernetes.	The material	that	follows	will	be	helpful	in	understanding whichever	orchestrators	you	use	in	your	daily	job.   11.1.	A	SERVICE	“HELLO	WORLD!”  Getting	started	with	services	is	as	easy	as	getting	started	with containers.	In	this	case,	you	can	start	a	“Hello	World!”	web server	locally	by	running	these	two	commands:  docker	swarm	init																					1 docker	service	create	\															2 				--publish	8080:80	\ 				--name	hello-world	\ 			dockerinaction ch11_service_hw:v1  1	Enables	the	service	abstraction  2	Starts	the	server	on	localhost:8080  Unlike	containers,	Docker	services	are	available	only	when Docker	is	running	in	swarm	mode.	Initializing	swarm	mode starts	an	internal	database	as	well	as	a	long-running	loop	in	the Docker	Engine	that	performs	service	orchestration;	see	figure 11.1.	Swarm	provides	several	other	features	that	will	be covered	in	the	rest	of	the	book.	Running	the	init	command in	the	preceding	code	enables	the	service	management subcommands.  Figure	11.1.	Initializing	a	swarm	node  The	service	create	subcommand	defines	a	service named	hello-world	that	should	be	available	on	port	8080,   and	uses	the	image,	dockerinaction ch11_service _hw:v1	as	shown	in	figure	11.2.  Figure	11.2.	Creating	your	first	service  After	you	run	these	two	commands,	you	should	see	a	progress bar	describing	the	state	of	the	service.	Once	the	progress	is complete,	it	will	be	labeled	Running,	and	the	command	will exit.	At	this	point,	you	should	be	able	to	open http:  localhost:8080	and	see	a	nice	little	message,	Hello, World!	--ServiceV1.	It	will	also	display	the	task	ID  container	ID 	that	served	the	request.  A	task	is	a	swarm	concept	that	represents	a	unit	of	work.	Each task	has	one	associated	container.	Although	there	could	be other	types	of	tasks	that	don’t	use	containers,	those	are	not	the subject	of	this	chapter.	Swarm	works	only	with	tasks.	The underlying	components	transform	task	definitions	into containers.	This	book	is	not	concerned	with	Docker	internals. For	our	purposes,	you	can	consider	the	terms	task	and container	roughly	interchangeable.  Figure	11.3.	The	swarm	node	automatically	creates	a	container	to	run	the	service	software.   This	should	feel	just	like	running	a	similar	container	example. Rather	than	focusing	on	how	services	and	containers	are similar,	it	is	more	enlightening	to	focus	on	how	they	differ. First,	recognize	that	service	workloads	are	implemented	with containers.	With	the	service	running,	run	docker container	ps	to	discover	that	there	is	a	container	running with	a	name,	such	as	hello- world.1.pqamgg6bl5eh6p8j4fj503kur.	There	is nothing	special	about	this	container.	Inspecting	the	container does	not	yield	any	particularly	interesting	results.	You	might notice	a	few	Swarm-specific	labels,	but	that	is	it.	However,	if you	remove	the	container,	something	interesting	happens.	The remainder	of	this	section	describes	the	higher-level	properties, the	service	life	cycle,	and	how	Swarm	uses	those	to	perform small	automated	miracles	such	as	service	resurrection.  11.1.1.	Automated	resurrection	and	replication  Bringing	a	service	back	to	life	is	something	most	developers and	operators	are	a	bit	too	familiar	with.	For	those	people, manually	killing	the	sole	process	running	a	service	might	feel like	tempting	fate.	Like	kicking	an	early	model	robot	with artificial	intelligence—it	just	feels	like	a	bigger	risk	than	we’d prefer	to	take.	But	with	the	right	tools	 and	validation	of	those   tools ,	we	can	be	comfortable	knowing	that	taking	the	risk probably	won’t	result	in	any	Armageddon-like	business scenario.  If	you	remove	the	sole	container	that	is	powering	the	hello- world	service	 from	the	previous	section ,	the	container	will be	stopped	and	removed,	but	after	a	few	moments	it	will	be back.	Or	at	least	another	similarly	configured	container	will	be there	in	its	place.	Try	this	yourself:	find	the	ID	of	the	container running	the	server	 using	docker	ps ;	use	docker container	rm	-f	to	remove	it;	then	issue	a	few	docker container	ps	commands	to	verify	that	it	has	been removed,	and	watch	a	replacement	appear.	Next,	dig	into	this resurrection	by	using	the	service	subcommands	shown	in figure	11.4.  Figure	11.4.	Timeline	of	Swarm	reactions	to	changes	in	service	specification	and	state  First,	run	docker	service	ls	to	list	the	running	services.   The	list	will	include	the	hello-world	service	and	show	that one	replica	is	running,	indicated	by	1 1	in	the	REPLICAS column	of	the	command	output.	This	is	evidenced	by	the container	that	came	back	to	life.	Next,	run	docker service	ps	hello-world	to	list	the	containers associated	with	a	specific	service	 hello-world	in	this case .	The	list	includes	two	entries.	The	list	will	show	the	first entry	with	a	Desired	State	of	“Running,”	and	a	Current	State of	“Running	x	minutes	ago.”	The	second	entry	will	be listed	as	Shutdown	and	Failed,	respectively.	These	two columns	hint	at	critical	ideas,	so	let’s	unpack	them	now. Consider	this	excerpt	from	docker	service	ps	output:  NAME																DESIRED	STATE							CURRENT	STATE hello-world.1							Running													Running	less	than	a second	ago 	\_	hello-world.1			Shutdown												Failed	16	seconds	ago  Autonomous	orchestrators—such	as	the	Swarm	components	in Docker—track	two	things:	desired	state	and	the	current	state. The	desired	state	is	what	the	user	wants	the	system	to	be doing,	or	what	it	is	supposed	to	be	doing.	The	current	state describes	what	the	system	is	actually	doing.	Orchestrators track	these	two	descriptions	of	state	and	reconcile	the	two	by changing	the	system.  In	this	example,	the	swarm	orchestrator	notices	that	the container	for	the	hello-world	service	has	failed.	It	doesn’t matter	that	you	killed	the	process	in	this	case.	All	the orchestrator	knows	is	that	the	process	has	failed	and	that	the desired	state	of	the	service	is	Running.	Swarm	knows	how	to make	a	process	run:	start	a	container	for	that	service.	And	that   is	exactly	what	it	does.  Using	higher-level	abstractions	with	autonomous	orchestrators is	more	like	a	partnership	than	using	a	tool.	Orchestrators remember	how	a	system	should	be	operating	and	manipulate	it without	being	asked	to	do	so	by	a	user.	So,	in	order	to	use orchestrators	effectively,	you	need	to	understand	how	to describe	systems	and	their	operation.	You	can	learn	quite	a	bit about	managing	services	by	inspecting	the	hello-world service.  When	you	run	docker	service	inspect	hello- world,	Docker	will	output	the	current	desired	state	definition for	the	service.	The	resulting	JSON	document	includes	the following:  Name	of	the	service  Service	ID  Versioning	and	timestamps  A	template	for	the	container	workloads  A	replication	mode  Rollout	parameters  Similar	rollback	parameters  A	description	of	the	service	endpoint  The	first	few	items	identify	the	service	and	its	change	history. It	starts	to	get	interesting	with	replication	mode,	and	rollout and	rollback	parameters.	Recall	our	definition	of	a	service:	any processes,	functionality,	or	data	that	must	be	discoverable	and available	over	a	network.	The	difficulty	of	running	a	service is,	by	definition,	more	about	managing	availability	of   something	on	a	network.	So	it	shouldn’t	be	too	surprising	that a	service	definition	is	predominantly	about	how	to	run replicas,	manage	changes	to	the	software,	and	route	requests	to the	service	endpoint	to	that	software.	These	are	the	higher- level	properties	uniquely	associated	with	the	service abstraction.	Let’s	examine	these	in	more	depth.  A	replication	mode	tells	Swarm	how	to	run	replicas	of	the workload.	Today	there	are	two	modes:	replicated	and	global. A	service	in	replicated	mode	will	create	and	maintain	a	fixed number	of	replicas.	This	is	the	default	mode,	and	you	can experiment	with	that	now	by	using	the	docker	service scale	command.	Tell	your	swarm	to	run	three	replicas	of	the hello-world	service	by	running	the	following:  docker	service	scale	hello-world=3  After	the	containers	start	up,	you	can	verify	the	work	by	using either	docker	container	ps	or	docker	service ps	hello-world	to	list	the	individual	containers	 there should	be	three	now .	You	should	notice	that	the	container- naming	convention	encodes	the	service	replica	number.	For example,	you	should	see	a	container	with	a	name	such	as hello-world.3.pqamgg6bl5eh6p8j4fj503kur.	If you	scale	the	service	back	down,	you’ll	also	notice	that	higher- numbered	containers	are	removed	first.	So	if	you	run	docker service	scale	hello-world=2,	the	container	named hello-world	.3.pqamgg6bl5eh6p8j4fj503kur will	be	removed.	But	hello-world.1	and	hello- world.2	will	remain	untouched.   The	second	mode,	global,	tells	Docker	to	run	one	replica	on each	node	in	the	swarm	cluster.	This	mode	is	more	difficult	to experiment	with	at	this	point	because	you’re	running	only	a single-node	cluster	 unless	you’re	skipping	ahead .	Services	in global	mode	are	useful	for	maintaining	a	common	set	of infrastructure	services	that	must	be	available	locally	on	each node	in	a	cluster.  It	isn’t	important	that	you	have	a	deep	understanding	of	how replication	works	in	a	docker	swarm	at	this	point.	But	it	is critical	to	understand	that	maintaining	high	service	availability requires	running	replicas	of	that	service	software.	Using replicas	allows	you	to	replace	or	change	portions	of	the	replica set,	or	survive	failures	without	impacting	the	service availability.	When	you	have	replicas	of	software,	certain operational	stories	become	more	complicated.	For	example, upgrading	software	is	not	as	simple	as	stopping	the	old	version and	starting	the	new	one.	A	few	properties	impact	change management	and	deployment	processes.  11.1.2.	Automated	rollout  Rolling	out	a	new	version	of	replicated	service	software	is	not particularly	complicated,	but	you	should	consider	a	few important	parameters	when	automating	the	process.	You	have to	describe	the	characteristics	of	the	deployment.	Those include	order,	batch	sizes,	and	delays.	This	is	done	by specifying	constraints	and	parameters	to	the	swarm orchestrator	that	it	will	respect	during	the	deployment	process. An	illustration	of	a	Docker	swarm’s	actions	when	deploying an	update	is	shown	in	figure	11.5.   Figure	11.5.	Timeline	of	automated	deployment	of	an	updated	service	definition	to	a	Docker swarm  Consider	this	command	to	update	the	hello-world	service created	earlier	in	this	chapter:  docker	service	update	\ 				--image	dockerinaction ch11_service_hw:v2	\					1 				--update-order	stop-first	\ 				--update-parallelism	1	\ 				--update-delay	30s	\ 				hello-world																																					2  1	The	new	image  2	The	name	of	the	service	to	update  This	command	tells	Docker	to	change	the	hello-world service	to	use	the	image	tagged	v2.	It	further	qualifies	the deployment	characteristics:	only	one	replica	should	be	updated at	a	time;	wait	for	30	seconds	between	updating	each	batch	of replicas;	and	each	replica	should	be	stopped	before	its replacement	is	started.	When	you	execute	the	command, Docker	will	report	the	deployment	progress	for	each	replica   and	the	change	overall.	If	everything	goes	well,	it	will	close	by stating	that	the	Service	converged.	That	is	a	particularly robotic	way	of	telling	the	user	that	the	command	was successful.	Converged	is	a	technical	way	to	say	that	current state	of	the	service	is	the	same	as	the	desired	state	described by	the	command.  After	you’ve	updated	the	service,	you	should	be	able	to	reload the	application	in	your	browser	and	see	that	it	has	been	signed --ServiceV2.	This	is	not	a	particularly	interesting	example because	everything	just	works.	Things	aren’t	so	simple	in	the real	world.	We	use	parallelism	to	balance	the	time	it	takes	to update	our	service	with	protection	for	our	users	from	failed transitions.	We	introduce	delay	between	update	batches	to allow	new	service	instances	to	become	stable	before	starting  and	to	make	sure	that	the	underlying	platform	remains	stable . In	reality,	30	seconds	might	not	be	enough	time.	It	depends	on the	application.  Docker	and	its	Swarm	components	are	application	agnostic. They	could	never	anticipate	the	behavior	of	all	the	applications that	might	be	deployed	or	how	they	might	fail	at	runtime. Instead,	the	Docker	command	line	and	API	provide	ways	for the	user	to	specify	the	methods	for	discovering	problems	and validating	success,	and	the	behavior	for	managing	failed deployments.  11.1.3.	Service	health	and	rollback  A	successful	partnership	with	an	orchestrator	means	clearly communicating	the	expected	requirements	and	behavior	of	the   workload	you’re	asking	it	to	orchestrate.	Although	Docker	can be	sure	that	a	stopped	container	is	unhealthy,	there	is	no universal	and	accurate	definition	of	service	health.	This	limits the	safe	assumptions	that	any	orchestrator	can	make	about service	health,	and	deployment	success	or	failure.	Determining workload	health	or	startup	behavior	expectations	might	be more	nuanced	than	you’d	expect	unless	you’re	an	experienced service	owner.  Before	getting	too	far	into	the	details,	start	with	a	simple example.	In	the	most	obvious	case	of	service	health	problems, the	new	containers	might	fail	to	start:  docker	service	update	\ 				--image	dockerinaction ch11_service_hw:start-failure	\ 				hello-world  When	you	execute	this	command,	Docker	will	start	a deployment	on	the	hello-world	service.	Unlike	the	others, this	change	will	fail.	By	default,	Docker	will	pause	the deployment	after	the	first	replica	fails	to	start.	The	command will	exit,	but	it	will	continue	to	attempt	to	start	that	container. If	you	run	docker	service	ps	hello-world,	you will	see	that	two	of	the	replicas	remain	on	the	old	version	of the	service,	and	the	other	replica	keeps	cycling	through starting	and	failed	states.  In	this	scenario,	the	deployment	cannot	proceed.	The	new version	will	never	start.	And	as	a	result,	the	service	is	stuck	at reduced	capacity	and	will	require	human	intervention	to	repair. Fix	the	immediate	issue	by	using	the	--rollback	flag	on   the	update	command:  docker	service	update	\ 				--rollback	\ 				hello-world  This	command	will	ask	Docker	to	reconcile	the	current	state with	the	previous	desired	state.	Docker	will	determine	that	it needs	to	change	only	one	of	the	three	replicas	 the	one	that failed	to	start .	It	knows	that	the	service	is	currently	in	a paused	deployment	and	that	only	one	of	the	replicas	was transitioned	to	the	current	desired	state.	The	other	replicas	will continue	operating.  Knowing	that	rollback	is	appropriate	for	this	service	 no	risk of	incompatible	application	state	changes ,	you	can	automate rollback	when	the	deployment	fails.	Use	the	--update- failure-action	flag	to	tell	Swarm	that	failed deployments	should	roll	back.	But	you	should	also	explicitly tell	Swarm	which	conditions	should	be	considered	a	failure.  Suppose	you’re	running	100	replicas	of	a	service	and	those	are to	be	run	on	a	large	cluster	of	machines.	Chances	are	that	a certain	set	of	conditions	might	prevent	a	replica	from	starting correctly.	In	that	case,	it	might	be	appropriate	to	continue	a deployment	as	long	as	a	critical	threshold	of	replicas	are operational.	In	this	next	deployment,	tell	Swarm	to	tolerate start	failures	as	long	as	one-third	of	the	fleet	is	operational	for illustrative	purposes.	You’ll	use	the	--update-max- failure-ratio	flag	and	specify	0.6:  docker	service	update	\ 				--update-failure-action	rollback	\   				--update-failure-action	rollback	\ 				--update-max-failure-ratio	0.6	\ 				--image	dockerinaction ch11_service_hw:start-failure	\ 				hello-world  When	you	run	this	example,	you’ll	watch	Docker	attempt	to deploy	updated	replicas	one	at	a	time.	The	first	one	will	retry	a few	times	before	the	delay	expires	and	the	next	replica deployment	starts.	Immediately	after	the	second	replica	fails, the	whole	deployment	will	be	marked	as	failed	and	a	rollback will	be	initiated.	The	output	will	look	something	like	this:  hello-world overall	progress:	rolling	back	update:	2	out	of	3	tasks 1 3:	running		[>																		] 2 3:	starting	[=====>													] 3 3:	running		[>																		] rollback:	update	rolled	back	due	to	failure	or	early	 termination	of	 task	tdpv6fud16e4nbg3tx2jpikah service	rolled	back:	rollback	completed  After	the	command	finishes,	the	service	will	be	in	the	same state	as	it	was	prior	to	the	update.	You	can	verify	this	by running	docker	service	ps	hello-world.	Note	that one	replica	was	untouched,	while	the	other	two	were	started much	more	recently	and	at	nearly	the	same	time.	At	this	point, all	the	replicas	will	be	running	from	the dockerinaction ch11_service_hw:v2	image.  As	we	mentioned	earlier,	running	is	not	the	same	thing	as service	health.	There	are	plenty	of	ways	that	a	program	might be	running,	but	not	correctly.	Like	other	orchestrators,	Docker models	health	separately	from	process	status	and	provides	a few	configuration	points	for	specifying	how	to	determine   service	health.  Docker	is	application	agnostic.	Rather	than	making assumptions	about	how	to	determine	whether	a	specific	task	is healthy,	it	lets	you	specify	a	health	check	command.	That command	will	be	executed	from	within	the	container	for	each service	replica.	Docker	will	execute	that	command periodically	on	the	specified	schedule	from	within	the	task containers	themselves.	This	behaves	just	like	issuing	a docker	exec	command.	Health	checks	and	related parameters	can	be	specified	at	service	creation	time,	changed or	set	on	service	updates,	or	even	specified	as	image	metadata by	using	the	HEALTHCHECK	Dockerfile	directive.  Each	service	replica	container	 task 	will	inherit	the	definition of	health	and	health	check	configuration	from	the	service. When	you	want	to	manually	inspect	the	health	of	a	specific task	in	Docker,	you	need	to	inspect	the	container,	not	the service	itself.	Both	the	v1	and	v2	versions	of	the	service you’ve	been	using	have	health	checks	specified	in	the	image. The	images	include	a	small	custom	program	called httpping.	It	verifies	that	the	service	is	responsive	on localhost	and	that	requests	to	 	result	in	an	HTTP	200	response code.	The	Dockerfiles	include	the	following	directive:  HEALTHCHECK	--interval=10s	CMD	[" bin httpping"]  Run	docker	container	ps	to	see	that	each	hello- world	replica	is	marked	as	healthy	in	the	status	column.	You can	further	inspect	the	configuration	by	inspecting	either	the image	or	container.   Including	some	default	health	check	configuration	is	a	good idea	for	images	containing	service	software,	but	it	is	not always	available.	Consider	dockerinaction ch11 _service_hw:no-health.	This	image	is	essentially	the same	as	the	v1	and	v2	images,	but	it	does	not	include	any health	check	metadata.	Update	the	hello-world	service	to use	this	version	now:  docker	service	update	\ 				--update-failure-action	rollback	\ 				--image	dockerinaction ch11_service_hw:no-health	\ 				hello-world  After	deploying	this	version,	you	should	be	able	to	run docker	container	ps	again	and	see	that	the	containers are	no	longer	marked	healthy.	Docker	cannot	determine whether	the	service	is	healthy	without	health	check	metadata. It	knows	only	whether	the	software	is	running.	Next,	update the	service	to	add	the	health	check	metadata	from	the command	line:  docker	service	update	\ 				--health-cmd	 bin httpping	\ 				--health-interval	10s	\ 				hello-world  Health	monitoring	requires	continuous	evaluation.	The	interval specified	here	tells	Docker	how	often	to	check	the	health	of each	service	instance.	When	you	run	this	command,	you	can verify	that	the	service	replicas	are	marked	as	healthy	once again.  Today	you	can	also	tell	Docker	how	many	times	to	retry	a   health	check	before	reporting	an	unhealthy	status,	a	startup delay,	and	a	time-out	for	running	a	health	check	command. These	parameters	help	tune	the	behavior	to	accommodate	most cases.	Sometimes	a	default	or	current	health	check	for	a service	is	inappropriate	for	the	way	you	are	using	it.	In	those cases,	you	can	create	or	update	a	service	with	health	checks disabled	by	using	the	--no-healthcheck	flag.  During	a	deployment,	a	new	container	might	not	start.	Or	it might	start	but	not	quite	work	correctly	 be	unhealthy .	But how	do	you	define	service	health?	Timing	issues	might	blur those	definitions.	How	long	should	you	wait	for	an	instance	to become	healthy?	Some	but	not	all	of	the	service	replicas	might fail	or	be	otherwise	unhealthy.	How	many	or	what	portion	of replica	deployment	failure	can	your	service	tolerate?	Once	you can	answer	these	questions,	you	can	tell	Docker	about	those thresholds	and	tune	the	signal	of	health	from	your	application to	the	orchestrator.	In	the	meantime,	you’re	free	to	delete	the hello-world	service:  docker	service	rm	hello-world  Setting	all	of	these	parameters	when	you’re	managing	a service	from	the	command	line	is	a	mess.	When	you’re managing	several	services,	it	can	get	even	worse.	In	the	next section,	you’ll	learn	how	to	use	the	declarative	tooling provided	by	Docker	and	make	things	more	manageable.   11.2.	DECLARATIVE	SERVICE	ENVIRONMENTS	WITH COMPOSE	V3  Until	this	point	in	the	book,	you’ve	used	the	Docker	command line	to	individually	create,	change,	remove,	or	interact	with containers,	images,	networks,	and	volumes.	We	say	that systems	like	this	follow	an	imperative	pattern.	Imperative- style	tools	carry	out	commands	issued	by	a	user.	The commands	might	retrieve	specific	information	or	describe	a specific	change.	Programming	languages	and	command-line tools	follow	an	imperative	pattern.  The	benefit	of	imperative	tools	is	that	they	give	a	user	the ability	to	use	primitive	commands	to	describe	much	more complex	flows	and	systems.	But	the	commands	must	be followed	exactly,	in	precise	order,	so	that	they	have	exclusive control	of	the	working	state.	If	another	user	or	process	is changing	the	state	of	the	system	at	the	same	time,	the	two users	might	make	undetectable	conflicting	changes.  Imperative	systems	have	a	few	problems.	It	is	burdensome	for users	to	carefully	plan	and	sequence	all	of	the	commands required	to	achieve	a	goal.	Those	plans	are	often	challenging to	audit	or	test.	Timing	or	shared	state	issues	are	incredibly difficult	to	discover	and	test	before	deployment.	And	as	most programmers	will	tell	you,	small	or	innocuous	mistakes	might radically	change	the	outcome.  Imagine	you’re	responsible	for	building	and	maintaining	a   system	that	comprises	10,	100,	or	1000	logical	services,	each with	its	own	state,	network	attachment,	and	resource requirements.	Now	imagine	that	you	are	using	raw	containers to	manage	replicas	of	those	services.	It	would	be	much	more difficult	to	manage	the	raw	containers	than	Docker	services.  Docker	services	are	declarative	abstractions,	as	illustrated	in figure	11.6.	When	we	create	a	service,	we	declare	that	we want	a	certain	number	of	replicas	of	that	service,	and	Docker takes	care	of	the	individual	commands	required	to	maintain them.	Declarative	tools	enable	users	to	describe	the	new	state of	a	system,	rather	than	the	steps	required	to	change	from	the current	state	to	the	new	state.  Figure	11.6.	Declarative	processing	loop  The	Swarm	orchestration	system	is	a	state	reconciliation	loop that	continuously	compares	the	declared	state	of	the	system   that	the	user	desires	with	the	current	state	of	the	system.	When it	detects	a	difference,	it	uses	a	simple	set	of	rules	to	change the	system	so	that	it	matches	the	desired	state.  Declarative	tools	close	the	issues	with	the	imperative	pattern. Declarative	interfaces	simplify	the	system	by	imposing constraints	on	how	the	system	operates.	This	enables	the declared	policy	to	be	implemented	by	one	or	a	few	well-tested engines	that	can	converge	the	system	to	the	declared	state. They	are	easier	to	write,	audit,	and	comprehend.	Declarative statements	or	documents	are	wonderfully	paired	with	version- control	systems	because	they	allow	us	to	effectively	version- control	the	state	of	the	systems	that	they	describe.  Imperative	and	declarative	tools	are	not	in	competition.	You will	almost	never	use	one	without	the	other.	For	example, when	we	create	or	update	a	Docker	service,	we	are	using	an imperative	tool	to	describe	a	change	to	the	system.	Issuing	the docker	service	create	command	is	imperative,	but	it creates	a	declarative	abstraction.	It	rolls	up	a	whole	world	of lower-level	management	commands	for	creating	and	removing containers,	evaluating	health,	pulling	images,	managing service	discovery,	and	network	routing.  As	you	build	more	complex	systems	of	services,	volumes, networks,	and	configuration,	the	number	of	imperative commands	required	to	achieve	your	goals	will	become	a	new burden.	When	that	happens,	it	is	time	to	adopt	a	higher-level declarative	abstraction.	In	this	case,	that	abstraction	is	a	stack or	complete	environment	as	described	with	Docker	Compose.   When	you	need	to	model	a	whole	environment	of	services, you	should	use	a	Docker	stack.	A	stack	describes	collections of	services,	volumes,	networks,	and	other	configuration abstractions.	The	docker	command	line	provides	imperative commands	for	deploying,	removing,	and	inspecting	stacks. Stacks	are	created	from	a	declarative	description	of	an	entire environment.	These	environments	are	described	using	the Docker	Compose	V3	file	format.	A	Compose	file	that describes	an	environment	with	the	hello-world	service from	earlier	might	look	like	the	following:  version:	"3.7" services: 				hello-world: 								image:	dockerinaction ch11_service_hw:v1 								ports: 												-	8080:80 								deploy: 												replicas:	3  Compose	files	use	Yet	Another	Markup	Language	 YAML . Not	everyone	is	familiar	with	YAML,	and	that	can	be	a	hurdle to	adopting	several	tools	in	this	generation	of	infrastructure and	workload	management	tooling.	The	good	news	is	that people	rarely	use	exotic	YAML	features.	Most	people	stick	to the	basics.  This	chapter	is	not	an	exhaustive	survey	of	Compose	or	the properties	you	will	use	to	manage	services.	The	official Docker	documentation	should	serve	that	purpose.	Expect	to find	every	command-line	feature	mirrored	in	Compose.	The next	section	is	a	brief	primer	on	YAML	and	Compose	files.  11.2.1.	A	YAML	primer   YAML	is	used	to	describe	structured	documents,	which	are made	up	of	structures,	lists,	maps,	and	scalar	values.	Those features	are	defined	as	continuous	blocks,	where	substructures are	defined	with	nested	block	definitions	in	a	style	that	will feel	familiar	to	most	high-level	language	programmers.  The	default	scope	of	a	YAML	document	is	a	single	file	or stream.	YAML	provides	a	mechanism	to	specify	multiple documents	in	the	same	file,	but	Docker	will	use	only	the	first document	it	encounters	in	a	Compose	file.	The	standard filename	for	Compose	files	is	docker-compose.yml.  Comment	support	is	one	of	the	most	popular	reasons	to	adopt YAML	instead	of	JSON	today.	A	YAML	document	can include	a	comment	at	the	end	of	any	line.	Comments	are marked	by	a	space	followed	by	a	hash	sign	 	 .	Any characters	that	follow	until	the	end	of	the	line	are	ignored	by the	parser.	Empty	lines	between	elements	have	no	impact	on the	document	structure.  YAML	uses	three	types	of	data	and	two	styles	of	describing that	data,	block	and	flow.	Flow	collections	are	specified similarly	to	collection	literals	in	JavaScript	and	other languages.	For	example,	the	following	is	a	list	of	strings	in	the flow	style:  ["PersonA","PersonB"]  The	block	style	is	more	common	and	will	be	used	in	this primer	except	where	noted.	The	three	types	of	data	are	maps, lists,	and	scalar	values.   Maps	are	defined	by	a	set	of	unique	properties	in	the	form	of key value	pairs	that	are	delimited	by	a	colon	and	space	 :	 . Whereas	property	names	must	be	string	values,	property values	can	be	any	of	the	YAML	data	types	except	documents. A	single	structure	cannot	have	multiple	definitions	for	the same	property.	Consider	this	block	style	example:  image:	"alpine" command:	echo	hello	world  This	document	contains	a	single	map	with	two	properties: image	and	command.	The	image	property	has	a	scalar string	value,	"alpine".	The	command	property	has	a	scalar string	value,	echo	hello	world.	A	scalar	is	a	single value.	The	preceding	example	demonstrates	two	of	the	three flow	scalar	styles.  The	value	for	image	in	the	preceding	example	is	specified	in double-quote	style,	which	is	capable	of	expressing	arbitrary strings,	by	using	\	escape	sequences.	Most	programmers	are familiar	with	this	string	style.  The	value	for	the	command	is	written	in	plain	style.	The	plain  unquoted 	style	has	no	identifying	indicators	and	provides	no form	of	escaping.	It	is	therefore	the	most	readable,	most limited,	and	most	context-sensitive	style.	A	bunch	of	rules	are used	for	plain	style	scalars.	Plain	scalars  Must	not	be	empty  Must	not	contain	leading	or	trailing	whitespace	characters  Must	not	begin	with	an	indicator	character	 for	example,	-	or	: 	in	places where	doing	so	would	cause	an	ambiguity   Must	never	contain	character	combinations	using	a	colon	 : 	and	hash sign	    Lists	 or	block	sequences 	are	series	of	nodes	in	which	each element	is	denoted	by	a	leading	hyphen	 - 	indicator.	For example:  -	item	1 -	item	2 -	item	3 -		an	empty	item -	item	4  Finally,	YAML	uses	indentation	to	indicate	content	scope. Scope	determines	which	block	each	element	belongs	to.	There are	a	few	rules:  Only	spaces	can	be	used	for	indentation.  The	amount	of	indentation	does	not	matter	as	long	as  All	peer	elements	 in	the	same	scope 	have	the	same	amount	of indentation.  Any	child	elements	are	further	indented.  These	documents	are	equivalent:  top-level: 			second-level:											three	spaces 					third-level:										two	more	spaces 						-	"list	item"								single	additional	indent	on	items in	this	list 					another-third-level:		a	third-level	peer	with	the	same two	spaces 											fourth-level:	"string	scalar"		6	more	spaces 			another-second-level:			a	2nd	level	peer	with	three	spaces 															-	a	list	item		list	items	in	this	scope	have 																														15	total	leading	spaces 															-	a	peer	item		A	peer	list	item	with	a	gap	in the	list --- 	every	scope	level	adds	exactly	1	space   	every	scope	level	adds	exactly	1	space top-level: 	second-level: 		third-level: 			-	"list	item" 		another-third-level: 			fourth-level:	"string	scalar" 	another-second-level: 		-	a	list	item 		-	a	peer	item  The	full	YAML	1.2	specification	is	available	at http:  yaml.org spec 1.2 2009-07-21 spec.html	and	is	quite readable.	Armed	with	a	basic	understanding	of	YAML,	you’re ready	to	jump	into	basic	environment	modeling	with Compose.  11.2.2.	Collections	of	services	with	Compose	V3  Compose	files	describe	every	first-class	Docker	resource	type: services,	volumes,	networks,	secrets,	and	configs.	Consider	a collection	of	three	services:	a	PostgreSQL	database,	a MariaDB	database,	and	a	web	administrative	interface	for managing	those	databases.	You	might	represent	those	services with	this	Compose	file:  version:	"3.7" services: 				postgres: 								image:	dockerinaction postgres:11-alpine 								environment: 												POSTGRES_PASSWORD:	example 	 				mariadb: 								image:	dockerinaction mariadb:10-bionic 								environment: 												MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD:	example 	 				adminer: 								image:	dockerinaction adminer:4 								ports: 												-	8080:8080   Keep	in	mind	that	this	document	is	in	YAML,	and	all	of	the properties	with	the	same	indentation	belong	to	the	same	map. This	Compose	file	has	two	top-level	properties:	version	and services.	The	version	property	tells	the	Compose interpreter	which	fields	and	structure	to	anticipate.	The services	property	is	a	map	of	service	names	to	service definitions.	Each	service	definition	is	a	map	of	properties.  In	this	case,	the	services	map	has	three	entries	with	keys: postgres,	mariadb,	and	adminer.	Each	of	those	entries defines	a	service	by	using	a	small	set	of	service	properties such	as	image,	environment,	or	ports.	Declarative documents	make	it	simple	to	concretely	specify	a	full	service definition.	Doing	so	will	reduce	implicit	dependencies	on default	values	and	reduce	the	educational	overhead	for	your fellow	team	members.	Omitting	a	property	will	use	the	default values	 just	as	when	using	the	command-line	interface .	These services	each	define	the	container	image.	The	postgres and	mariadb	services	specify	environment	variables. The	adminer	service	uses	ports	to	route	requests	to	port 8080	on	the	host	to	port	8080	in	the	service	container.  Creating	and	updating	a	stack  Now	use	this	Compose	file	to	create	a	stack.	Remember,	a Docker	stack	is	a	named	collection	of	services,	volumes, networks,	secrets,	and	configs.	The	docker	stack subcommands	manage	stacks.	Create	a	new	file	called databases.yml	in	an	empty	directory.	Edit	the	file	and	add	the preceding	Compose	file	contents.	Create	a	new	stack	and   deploy	the	services	it	describes	by	using	the	following command:  docker	stack	deploy	-c	databases.yml	my-databases  When	you	run	this	command,	Docker	will	display	output	like this:  Creating	network	my-databases_default Creating	service	my-databases_postgres Creating	service	my-databases_mariadb Creating	service	my-databases_adminer  At	this	point,	you	can	test	the	services	by	using	your	browser to	navigate	to	http:  localhost:8080.	Services	are	discoverable by	their	names	within	a	Docker	network.	You’ll	need	to	keep that	in	mind	when	you	use	the	adminer	interface	to	connect to	your	postgres	and	mariadb	services.	The	docker stack	deploy	subcommand	is	used	to	create	and	update stacks.	It	always	takes	the	Compose	file	that	represents	the desired	state	of	the	stack.	Whenever	the	Compose	file	that	you use	differs	from	the	definitions	used	in	the	current	stack, Docker	will	determine	how	the	two	differ	and	make	the appropriate	changes.  You	can	try	this	yourself.	Tell	Docker	to	create	three	replicas of	the	adminer	service.	Specify	the	replicas	property under	the	deploy	property	of	the	adminer	service.	Your databases.yml	file	should	look	like	this:  version:	"3.7" services: 				postgres: 								image:	dockerinaction postgres:11-alpine   								image:	dockerinaction postgres:11-alpine 								environment: 												POSTGRES_PASSWORD:	example 	 				mariadb: 								image:	dockerinaction mariadb:10-bionic 								environment: 												MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD:	example 	 				adminer: 								image:	dockerinaction adminer:4 								ports: 												-	8080:8080 								deploy: 												replicas:	3  After	you’ve	updated	your	Compose	file,	repeat	the	earlier docker	stack	deploy	command:  docker	stack	deploy	-c	databases.yml	my-databases  This	time,	the	command	will	display	a	message	noting	that services	are	being	updated,	not	created:  Updating	service	my-databases_mariadb	 id: lpvun5ncnleb6mhqj8bbphsf6  Updating	service	my-databases_adminer	 id: i2gatqudz9pdsaoux7auaiicm  Updating	service	my-databases_postgres	 id: eejvkaqgbbl35glatt977m65a   The	message	appears	to	indicate	that	all	of	the	services	are being	changed.	But	that	is	not	the	case.	You	can	use	docker stack	ps	to	list	all	of	the	tasks	and	their	ages:  docker	stack	ps	\ 		--format	'{{.Name}}\t{{.CurrentState}}'	\ 		my-databases																																	1  1	Specifies	which	stack	to	list   This	command	should	filter	for	the	interesting	columns	and report	something	like	the	following:  my-databases_mariadb.1		Running	3	minutes	ago my-databases_postgres.1	Running	3	minutes	ago my-databases_adminer.1		Running	3	minutes	ago 	 my-databases_adminer.2		Running	about	a	minute	ago my-databases_adminer.3		Running	about	a	minute	ago  This	view	hints	that	none	of	the	original	service	containers were	touched	during	the	new	deployment.	The	only	new	tasks are	those	additional	replicas	of	the	adminer	service	that	were required	to	bring	the	system	into	the	state	described	by	the current	version	of	the	databases.yml	file.	You	should	note	that the	adminer	service	really	doesn’t	work	well	when	multiple replicas	are	running.	We’re	using	it	here	for	illustrative purposes	only.  Scaling	down	and	removing	services  When	you’re	using	Docker	and	Compose,	you	never	need	to tear	down	or	otherwise	remove	a	whole	stack	when	you’re redeploying	or	making	changes.	Let	Docker	figure	it	out	and handle	the	change	for	you.	Only	one	case	is	tricky	to	deal	with when	you’re	working	with	declarative	representations	such	as Compose:	deletion.  Docker	will	delete	service	replicas	automatically	when	you scale	down.	It	always	chooses	the	highest	numbered	replicas for	removal.	For	example,	if	you	have	three	replicas	of	the adminer	service	running,	they	will	be	named	my- databases_adminer.1,	my- databases_adminer.2,	and	my-   databases_adminer.3.	If	you	scale	down	to	two replicas,	Docker	will	delete	the	replica	named	my- databases_adminer.3.	Things	get	weird	when	you	try	to delete	a	whole	service.  Edit	the	databases.yml	file	to	delete	the	mariadb	service definition	and	set	the	adminer	service	to	two	replicas.	The file	should	look	like	this:  version:	"3.7" services: 				postgres: 								image:	dockerinaction postgres:11-alpine 								environment: 												POSTGRES_PASSWORD:	example 	 				adminer: 								image:	dockerinaction adminer:4 								ports: 												-	8080:8080 								deploy: 												replicas:	2  Now	when	you	run	docker	stack	deploy	-c databases.yml	my-databases,	the	command	will generate	output	like	this:  Updating	service	my-databases_postgres	 id: lpvun5ncnleb6mhqj8bbphsf6  Updating	service	my-databases_adminer		 id: i2gatqudz9pdsaoux7auaiicm   The	Compose	file	you	provided	to	the	stack	deploy command	did	not	have	any	reference	to	the	mariadb	service, so	Docker	did	not	make	any	changes	to	that	service.	When	you list	the	tasks	in	your	stack	again,	you’ll	notice	that	the mariadb	service	is	still	running:   docker	stack	ps	\ 		--format	'{{.Name}}\t{{.CurrentState}}'	\ 		my-databases																																			1  1	Specifies	which	stack	to	list  Running	this	command	results	in	this	output:  my-databases_mariadb.1		Running	7	minutes	ago my-databases_postgres.1	Running	7	minutes	ago my-databases_adminer.1		Running	7	minutes	ago my-databases_adminer.2		Running	5	minutes	ago  You	can	see	that	the	third	replica	of	the	adminer	service	has been	removed,	but	the	mariadb	service	is	still	running.	This works	as	intended.	Docker	stacks	can	be	created	and	managed with	several	Compose	files.	But	doing	so	creates	several	error opportunities	and	is	not	recommended.	There	are	two	ways	to delete	services	or	other	objects.  You	can	manually	remove	a	service	by	using	docker service	remove.	This	works,	but	does	not	get	any	of	the benefits	of	working	with	declarative	representations.	If	this change	is	made	manually	and	not	reflected	in	your	Compose files,	the	next	docker	stack	deploy	operation	will create	the	service	again.	The	cleanest	way	to	remove	services in	a	stack	is	by	removing	the	service	definition	from	your Compose	file	and	then	executing	docker	stack	deploy with	the	--prune	flag.	Without	further	altering	your databases.yml	file,	run	the	following:  docker	stack	deploy	\ 		-c	databases.yml	\ 		--prune	\ 		my-databases   		my-databases  This	command	will	report	that	the	services	described	by databases.yml	have	been	updated,	but	will	also	report	that	my- databases_mariadb	has	been	removed.	When	you	list	the tasks	again,	you	will	see	that	this	is	the	case:  my-databases_postgres.1	Running	8	minutes	ago my-databases_adminer.1		Running	8	minutes	ago my-databases_adminer.2		Running	6	minutes	ago  The	--prune	flag	will	clean	up	any	resource	in	the	stack	that isn’t	explicitly	referenced	in	the	Compose	file	used	for	the deploy	operation.	For	that	reason,	it	is	important	to	keep	a Compose	file	that	represents	the	entire	environment. Otherwise,	you	might	accidentally	delete	absent	services	or volumes,	networks,	secrets,	and	configs.   11.3.	STATEFUL	SERVICES	AND	PRESERVING	DATA  The	Docker	stack	that	you’ve	been	working	with	includes	a database	service.	In	chapter	4,	you	learned	how	to	use	volumes to	separate	a	container	life	cycle	from	the	life	cycle	for	the data	it	uses.	This	is	especially	important	for	databases.	As specified	earlier,	the	stack	will	create	a	new	volume	for	the postgres	service	each	time	the	container	is	replaced	 for whatever	reason ,	and	a	new	volume	will	be	created	for	each replica.	This	would	cause	problems	in	a	real-world	system	for which	stored	data	is	an	important	part	of	service	identity.  The	best	way	to	begin	addressing	this	problem	is	by	modeling volumes	in	Compose.	Compose	files	use	another	top-level property	named	volumes.	Like	services,	volumes	is	a map	of	volume	definitions;	the	key	is	the	name	of	the	volume, and	the	value	is	a	structure	defining	the	volume	properties. You	do	not	need	to	specify	values	for	every	volume	property. Docker	will	use	defaults	for	omitted	property	values.	The	top- level	property	defines	the	volumes	that	can	be	used	by	services within	the	file.	Using	a	volume	in	a	service	requires	that	you specify	the	dependency	from	the	service	that	needs	it.  A	Compose	service	definition	can	include	a	volumes property.	That	property	is	a	list	of	short	or	long	volume specifications.	Those	correspond	to	the	volumes	and	mount syntax	supported	by	the	Docker	command	line,	respectively. We’ll	use	the	long	form	to	enhance	databases.yml	and	add	a volume	to	store	the	postgres	data:   version:	"3.7" volumes: 				pgdata:		empty	definition	uses	volume	defaults services: 				postgres: 								image:	dockerinaction postgres:11-alpine 								volumes: 												-	type:	volume 														source:	pgdata		The	named	volume	above 														target:	 var lib postgresql data 								environment: 												POSTGRES_PASSWORD:	example 				adminer: 								image:	dockerinaction adminer:4 								ports: 												-	8080:8080 								deploy: 												replicas:	1		Scale	down	to	1	replica	so	you	can test  In	this	example,	the	file	defines	a	volume	named	pgdata, and	the	postgres	service	mounts	that	volume	at  var lib postgresql data.	That	location	is	where the	PostgreSQL	software	will	store	any	database	schema	or data.	Deploy	the	stack	and	inspect	the	results:  docker	stack	deploy	\ 		-c	databases.yml	\ 		--prune	\ 		my-databases  Run	docker	volume	ls	after	the	changes	have	been applied	to	verify	that	the	operation	was	successful:  DRIVER								VOLUME	NAME local									my-databases_pgdata  The	name	of	the	stack	prefixes	any	resources	created	for	it such	as	services	or	volumes.	In	this	case,	Docker	created	the   volume	you	named	pgdata	with	the	prefix	my- databases.	You	could	spend	time	inspecting	the	service configuration	or	container	further,	but	it	is	more	interesting	to perform	a	functional	test.  Open	http:  localhost:8080	and	use	the	adminer	interface	to manage	the	postgres	database.	Select	the	postgresql driver,	use	postgres	as	the	hostname,	postgres	as	the username,	and	example	as	the	password.	After	you’ve logged	in,	create	a	few	tables	or	insert	some	data.	When	you’re done,	remove	the	postgres	service:  docker	service	remove	my-databases_postgres  Then	restore	the	service	by	using	the	Compose	file:  docker	stack	deploy	\ 		-c	databases.yml	\ 		--prune	\ 		my-databases  Because	the	data	is	stored	in	a	volume,	Docker	is	able	to	attach the	new	database	replica	to	the	original	pg-data	volume.	If the	data	wasn’t	stored	in	the	volume	and	existed	in	only	the original	replica,	it	would	have	been	lost	when	the	service	was removed.	Log	into	the	database	by	using	the	adminer interface	again	 remember	that	the	username	is	postgres, and	password	is	example	as	specified	in	the	Compose	file . Examine	the	database	and	look	for	the	changes	you	made.	If you’ve	followed	these	steps	correctly,	those	changes	and	the data	will	be	available.   This	example	uses	two	levels	of	naming	indirection	that	make it	a	bit	complicated	to	follow.	Your	browser	is	pointed	at localhost,	which	loads	the	adminer	service,	but	you’re telling	adminer	to	access	the	database	by	using	the postgres	hostname.	The	next	section	explains	that indirection,	and	describes	the	built-in	Docker	network enhancements	and	how	to	use	them	with	services.   11.4.	LOAD	BALANCING,	SERVICE	DISCOVERY,	AND NETWORKS	WITH	COMPOSE  In	accessing	the	adminer	interface	from	a	web	browser, you’re	accessing	the	published	port	on	the	adminer	service. Port	publishing	for	a	service	is	different	from	publishing	a	port on	a	container.	Whereas	containers	directly	map	the	port	on the	host	interface	to	an	interface	for	a	specific	container, services	might	be	made	up	of	many	replica	containers.  Container	network	DNS	faces	a	similar	challenge.	When you’re	resolving	the	network	address	of	a	named	container, you’ll	get	the	address	of	that	container.	But	services	might have	replicas.  Docker	accommodates	services	by	creating	virtual	IP	 VIP  addresses	and	balancing	requests	for	a	specific	service between	all	of	the	associated	replicas.	When	a	program attached	to	a	Docker	network	looks	up	the	name	of	another service	attached	to	that	network,	Docker’s	built-in	DNS resolver	will	respond	with	the	virtual	IP	for	that	service’s location	on	the	network.	Figure	11.7	illustrates	the	logical	flow of	service	name	and	IP	resolution.  Figure	11.7.	Docker	network	topology,	service	virtual	IP	addresses,	and	load	balancing   Likewise,	when	a	request	comes	into	the	host	interface	for	a published	port	or	from	an	internal	service,	it	will	be	routed	to the	target	service’s	virtual	IP	address.	From	there,	it	is forwarded	to	one	of	the	service	replicas.	This	means	that	there are	a	few	more	things	to	understand	about	Docker	networks. When	you’re	using	services,	you’re	using	at	least	two	Docker networks.  The	first	network	is	named	ingress	and	handles	all	port forwarding	from	the	host	interface	to	services.	It	is	created when	you	initialize	Docker	in	swarm	mode.	In	this	stack,	there is	only	one	service	with	forwarded	ports,	adminer.	You	can plainly	see	the	associated	interface	in	the	ingress	network upon	inspection:  "Containers":	{ 		"6f64f8aec8c2...":	{ 				"Name":	"my-databases_adminer.1.leijm5mpoz8o3lf4yxd7khnqn", 				"EndpointID":	"9401eca40941...", 				"MacAddress":	"02:42:0a:ff:00:22", 				"IPv4Address":	"10.255.0.34 16", 				"IPv6Address":	"" 		}, 		"ingress-sbox":	{ 				"Name":	"ingress-endpoint", 				"EndpointID":	"36c9b1b2d807...", 				"MacAddress":	"02:42:0a:ff:00:02", 				"IPv4Address":	"10.255.0.2 16", 				"IPv6Address":	"" 		}   }  Every	service	that	uses	port	forwarding	will	have	an	interface in	this	network;	ingress	is	critical	to	the	Docker	service functionality.  The	second	network	is	shared	between	all	of	the	services	in your	stack.	The	Compose	file	you	used	to	create	the	my- databases	stack	does	not	define	any	networks,	but	if	you watch	closely	during	initial	deployment,	you’ll	see	that	Docker will	create	a	network	for	your	stack	named	default.	All services	in	your	stack	will	be	attached	to	this	network	by default,	and	all	service-to-service	communication	will	go through	this	network.	When	you	inspect	that	network,	you	will see	three	entries	like	the	following:  "Containers":	{ 		"3e57151c76bd...":	{ 				"Name":	"my- databases_postgres.1.44phu5vee7lbu3r3ao38ffqfu", 				"EndpointID":	"375fe1bf3bc8...", 				"MacAddress":	"02:42:0a:00:05:0e", 				"IPv4Address":	"10.0.5.14 24", 				"IPv6Address":	"" 		}, 		"6f64f8aec8c2...":	{ 				"Name":	"my-databases_adminer.1.leijm5mpoz8o3lf4yxd7khnqn", 				"EndpointID":	"7009ae008702...", 				"MacAddress":	"02:42:0a:00:05:0f", 				"IPv4Address":	"10.0.5.15 24", 				"IPv6Address":	"" 		}, 		"lb-my-databases_default":	{ 				"Name":	"my-databases_default-endpoint", 				"EndpointID":	"8b94baa16c94...", 				"MacAddress":	"02:42:0a:00:05:04", 				"IPv4Address":	"10.0.5.4 24", 				"IPv6Address":	"" 		} }   The	top	two	interfaces	are	used	by	the	individual	containers running	the	postgres	and	adminer	services.	If	you	were to	resolve	the	postgres	service	name	to	an	IP	address,	you might	expect	the	address	10.0.5.14	in	response.	But	what	you would	get	is	something	else	not	listed	here.	The	address	listed here	is	the	container	address,	or	the	address	that	the	internal load	balancer	would	forward	requests	onto.	The	address	you would	get	is	listed	under	endpoints	in	the	postgres	service spec.	When	you	run	docker	service	inspect	my- databases_postgres,	part	of	the	result	will	look	like this:  "Endpoint":	{ 		"Spec":	{ 				"Mode":	"vip" 		}, 		"VirtualIPs":	[ 				{ 						"NetworkID":	"2wvn2x73bx55lrr0w08xk5am9", 						"Addr":	"10.0.5.11 24" 				} 		] }  That	virtual	IP	address	is	handled	by	the	Docker	internal	load balancer.	Connections	to	that	address	will	be	forwarded	to	one of	the	postgres	service	replicas.  You	can	change	service	network	attachment	or	the	networks Docker	creates	for	a	stack	with	Compose.	Compose	can	create networks	with	specific	names,	types,	driver	options,	or	other properties.	Working	with	networks	is	similar	to	volumes. There	are	two	parts:	a	top-level	networks	property	that includes	network	definitions,	and	a	networks	property	of services,	where	you	describe	attachments.	Consider	this	final   example:  version:	"3.7" networks: 				foo: 								driver:	overlay volumes: 				pgdata:		empty	definition	uses	volume	defaults services: 				postgres: 								image:	dockerinaction postgres:11-alpine 								volumes: 												-	type:	volume 														source:	pgdata		The	named	volume	above 														target:	 var lib postgresql data 								networks: 												-	foo 								environment: 												POSTGRES_PASSWORD:	example 				adminer: 								image:	dockerinaction adminer:4 								networks: 												-	foo 								ports: 												-	8080:8080 								deploy: 												replicas:	1  This	example	replaces	the	my-databases_default network	with	a	network	called	foo.	The	two	configurations are	functionally	equivalent.  There	are	several	occasions	to	model	networks	with	Compose. For	example,	if	you	manage	multiple	stacks	and	want	to communicate	on	a	shared	network,	you	would	declare	that network	as	shown	previously,	but	instead	of	specifying	the driver,	you	would	use	the	external:	true	property	and the	network	name.	Or	suppose	you	have	multiple	groups	of related	services,	but	those	services	should	operate	in	isolation. You	would	define	the	networks	at	the	top	level	and	use   different	network	attachments	to	isolate	the	groups.   SUMMARY  This	chapter	introduces	higher-level	Docker	abstractions	and working	with	the	Docker	declarative	tooling,	and	using Compose	to	model	the	desired	state	for	multi-service applications.	Compose	and	declarative	tooling	relieve	much	of the	tedium	associated	with	command-line	management	of containers.	The	chapter	covers	the	following:  A	service	is	any	process,	functionality,	or	data	that	must	be	discoverable and	available	over	a	network.  Orchestrators	such	as	Swarm	track	and	automatically	reconcile	user- provided	desired	state	and	the	current	state	of	Docker	objects	including services,	volumes,	and	networks.  Orchestrators	automate	service	replication,	resurrection,	deployments, health	checking,	and	rollback.  The	desired	state	is	what	the	user	wants	the	system	to	be	doing,	or	what	it is	supposed	to	be	doing.	People	can	describe	desired	state	in	a	declarative style	by	using	Compose	files.  Compose	files	are	structured	documents	represented	in	YAML.  Declarative	environment	descriptions	with	Compose	enable	environment versioning,	sharing,	iteration,	and	consistency.  Compose	can	model	services,	volumes,	and	networks.	Consult	the	official Compose	file	reference	material	for	a	full	description	of	its	capabilities.   Chapter	12.	First-class	configuration abstractions  This	chapter	covers  The	problems	configuration	and	secrets	solve	and	the	forms	those solutions	take  Modeling	and	solving	configuration	problems	for	Docker	services  The	challenge	of	delivering	secrets	to	applications  Modeling	and	delivering	secrets	to	Docker	services  Approaches	for	using	configurations	and	secrets	in	Docker	services  Applications	often	run	in	multiple	environments	and	must adapt	to	different	conditions	in	those	environments.	You	may run	an	application	locally,	in	a	test	environment	integrated with	collaborating	applications	and	data	sources,	and	finally	in production.	Perhaps	you	deploy	an	application	instance	for each	customer	in	order	to	isolate	or	specialize	each	customer’s experience	from	that	of	others.	The	adaptations	and specializations	for	each	deployment	are	usually	expressed	via configuration.	Configuration	is	data	interpreted	by	an application	to	adapt	its	behavior	to	support	a	use	case.  Common	examples	of	configuration	data	include	the following:  Features	to	enable	or	disable  Locations	of	services	the	application	depends	on  Limits	for	internal	application	resources	and	activities	such	as	database connection	pool	sizes	and	connection	time-outs   This	chapter	will	show	you	how	to	use	Docker’s	configuration and	secret	resources	to	adapt	Docker	service	deployments according	to	various	deployment	needs.	Docker’s	first-class resources	for	modeling	configuration	and	secrets	will	be	used to	deploy	a	service	with	different	behavior	and	features, depending	on	which	environment	it	is	deployed	to.	You	will see	how	the	naive	approach	for	naming	configuration resources	is	troublesome	and	learn	about	a	pattern	for	solving that	problem.	Finally,	you	will	learn	how	to	safely	manage	and use	secrets	with	Docker	services.	With	this	knowledge,	you will	deploy	the	example	web	application	with	an	HTTPS listener	that	uses	a	managed	TLS	certificate.   12.1.	CONFIGURATION	DISTRIBUTION	AND MANAGEMENT  Most	application	authors	do	not	want	to	change	the	program’s source	code	and	rebuild	the	application	each	time	they	need	to vary	the	behavior	of	an	application.	Instead,	they	program	the application	to	read	configuration	data	on	startup	and	adjust	its behavior	accordingly	at	runtime.  In	the	beginning,	it	may	be	feasible	to	express	this	variation via	command-line	flags	or	environment	variables.	As	the program’s	configuration	needs	grow,	many	implementations move	on	to	a	file-based	solution.	These	configuration	files help	you	express	both	a	greater	number	of	configurations	and more	complex	structures.	The	application	may	read	its configuration	from	a	file	formatted	in	the	ini,	properties, JSON,	YAML,	TOML,	or	other	format.	Applications	may	also read	configurations	from	a	configuration	server	available somewhere	on	the	network.	Many	applications	use	multiple strategies	for	reading	configuration.	For	example,	an application	may	read	a	file	first	and	then	merge	the	values	of certain	environment	variables	into	a	combined	configuration.  Configuring	applications	is	a	long-standing	problem	that	has many	solutions.	Docker	directly	supports	several	of	these application	configuration	patterns.	Before	we	discuss	that,	we will	explore	how	the	configuration	change	life	cycle	fits	within the	application’s	change	life	cycle.	Configurations	control	a wide	set	of	application	behaviors	and	so	may	change	for	many   reasons,	as	illustrated	in	figure	12.1.  Figure	12.1.	Timeline	of	application	changes  Let’s	examine	a	few	events	that	drive	configuration	changes. Configurations	may	change	in	conjunction	with	an	application enhancement.	For	example,	when	developers	add	a	feature, they	may	control	access	to	that	feature	with	a	feature	flag.	An application	deployment	may	need	to	update	in	response	to	a change	outside	the	application’s	scope.	For	example,	the hostname	configured	for	a	service	dependency	may	need	to update	from	cluster-blue	to	cluster-green.	And	of course,	applications	may	change	code	without	changing configuration.	These	changes	may	occur	for	reasons	that	are internal	or	external	to	an	application.	The	application’s delivery	process	must	merge	and	deploy	these	changes	safely regardless	of	the	reason	for	the	change.  A	Docker	service	depends	on	configuration	resources	much	in the	same	way	it	depends	on	the	Docker	image	containing	the application,	as	illustrated	in	figure	12.2.	If	a	configuration	or secret	is	missing,	the	application	will	probably	not	start	or behave	properly.	Also,	once	an	application	expresses	a dependency	on	a	configuration	resource,	the	existence	of	that dependency	must	be	stable.	Applications	will	likely	break	or   behave	in	unexpected	ways	if	the	configuration	they	depend on	disappears	when	the	application	restarts.	The	application might	also	break	if	the	values	inside	the	configuration	change unexpectedly.	For	example,	renaming	or	removing	entries inside	a	configuration	file	will	break	an	application	that	does not	know	how	to	read	that	format.	So	the	configuration lifecycle	must	adopt	a	scheme	that	preserves	backward compatibility	for	existing	deployments.  Figure	12.2.	Applications	depend	on	configurations.  If	you	separate	change	for	software	and	configuration	into separate	pipelines,	tension	will	exist	between	those	pipelines. Application	delivery	pipelines	are	usually	modeled	in	an application-centric	way,	with	an	assumption	that	all	changes will	run	through	the	application’s	source	repository.	Because configurations	can	change	for	reasons	that	are	external	to	the application,	and	applications	are	generally	not	built	to	handle   changes	that	break	backward	compatibility	in	the configuration	model,	we	need	to	model,	integrate,	and sequence	configuration	changes	to	avoid	breaking applications.	In	the	next	section,	we	will	separate configuration	from	an	application	to	solve	deployment variation	problems.	Then	we	will	join	the	correct	configuration with	the	service	at	deployment	time.   12.2.	SEPARATING	APPLICATION	AND CONFIGURATION  Let’s	work	through	a	problem	of	needing	to	vary	configuration of	a	Docker	service	deployed	to	multiple	environments.	Our example	application	is	a	greetings	service	that	says	“Hello World!”	in	different	languages.	The	developers	of	this	service want	the	service	to	return	a	greeting	when	a	user	requests	one. When	a	native	speaker	verifies	that	a	greeting	translation	is accurate,	it	is	added	to	the	list	of	greetings	in	the config.common.yml	file:  greetings: 		-	'Hello	World!' 		-	'Hola	Mundo!' 		-	'Hallo	Welt!'  The	application	image	build	uses	the	Dockerfile	COPY instruction	to	populate	the	greetings	application	image with	this	common	configuration	resource.	This	is	appropriate because	that	file	has	no	deployment-time	variation	or	sensitive data.  The	service	also	supports	loading	environment-specific greetings	in	addition	to	the	standard	ones.	This	allows	the development	team	to	vary	and	test	the	greetings	shown	in	each of	three	environments:	dev,	stage,	and	prod.	The	environment- specific	greetings	will	be	configured	in	a	file	named	after	the environment;	for	example,	config.dev.yml:  	config.dev.yml   	config.dev.yml greetings: 		-	'Orbis	Terrarum	salve!' 		-	'Bonjour	le	monde!'  Both	the	common	and	environment-specific	configuration	files must	be	available	as	files	on	the	greetings	service container’s	filesystem,	as	shown	in	figure	12.3.  Figure	12.3.	The	greetings	service	supports	common	and	environment-specific	configuration via	files.  So	the	immediate	problem	we	need	to	solve	is	how	to	get	the environment-specific	configuration	file	into	the	container	by using	only	the	deployment	descriptor.	Follow	along	with	this example	by	cloning	and	reading	the	files	in	the https:  github.com dockerinaction ch12_greetings.git	source repository.   The	greetings	application	deployment	is	defined	using	the Docker	Compose	application	format	and	deployed	to	Docker Swarm	as	a	stack.	These	concepts	were	introduced	in	chapter 11.	In	this	application,	there	are	three	Compose	files.	The deployment	configuration	that	is	common	across	all environments	is	contained	in	docker-compose.yml.	There	are also	environment-specific	Compose	files	for	both	of	the	stage and	prod	environments	 for	example,	docker- compose.prod.yml .	The	environment-specific	Compose	files define	additional	configuration	and	secret	resources	that	the service	uses	in	those	deployments.  Here	is	the	shared	deployment	descriptor,	docker- compose.yml:  version:	'3.7'  services:  configs: 		env_specific_config: 				file:	. api config config.${DEPLOY_ENV:-prod}.yml											 1  		api: 						image:	 ${IMAGE_REPOSITORY:-dockerinaction ch12_greetings}:api 						ports: 								-	'8080:8080' 								-	'8443:8443' 						user:	'1000' 						configs: 								-	source:	env_specific_config 										target:	 config config.${DEPLOY_ENV:-prod}.yml								 2 										uid:	'1000' 										gid:	'1000' 										mode:	0400	default	is	0444	-	readonly	for	all	users 						secrets:	[] 						environment: 								DEPLOY_ENV:	${DEPLOY_ENV:-prod}   1	Defines	a	config	resource	using	the	contents	of	the	env-specific configuration	file  2	Maps	the	env_specific_config	resource	to	a	file	in	the	container  This	Compose	file	loads	the	greetings	application’s environment-specific	configuration	files	into	the	api	service’s containers.	This	supplements	the	common	configuration	file built	into	the	application	image.	The	DEPLOY_ENV environment	variable	parameterizes	this	deployment definition.	This	environment	variable	is	used	in	two	ways.  First,	the	deployment	descriptor	will	produce	different deployment	definitions	when	Docker	interpolates DEPLOY_ENV.	For	example,	when	DEPLOY_ENV	is	set	to dev,	Docker	will	reference	and	load	config.dev.yml.  Second,	the	deployment	descriptor’s	value	of	the DEPLOY_ENV	variable	is	passed	to	the	greetings	service via	an	environment	variable	definition.	This	environment variable	signals	to	the	service	which	environment	it	is	running in,	enabling	it	to	do	things	such	as	load	configuration	files named	after	the	environment.	Now	let’s	examine	Docker config	resources	and	how	the	environment-specific configuration	files	are	managed.  12.2.1.	Working	with	the	config	resource  A	Docker	config	resource	is	a	Swarm	cluster	object	that deployment	authors	can	use	to	store	runtime	data	needed	by applications.	Each	config	resource	has	a	cluster-unique	name and	a	value	of	up	to	500	KB.	When	a	Docker	service	uses	a   config	resource,	Swarm	mounts	a	file	inside	the	service’s container	filesystems	populated	with	the	config	resource’s contents.  The	top-level	configs	key	defines	the	Docker	config resources	that	are	specific	to	this	application	deployment.	This configs	key	defines	a	map	with	one	config	resource, env_specific_config:  configs: 		env_specific_config: 				file:	. api config config.${DEPLOY_ENV:-prod}.yml  When	this	stack	is	deployed,	Docker	will	interpolate	the filename	with	the	value	of	the	DEPLOY_ENV	variable,	read that	file,	and	store	it	in	a	config	resource	named	env_ specific_config	inside	the	Swarm	cluster.  Defining	a	config	in	a	deployment	does	not	automatically	give services	access	to	it.	To	give	a	service	access	to	a	config,	the deployment	definition	must	map	it	under	the	service’s	own configs	key.	The	config	mapping	may	customize	the location,	ownership,	and	permissions	of	the	resulting	file	on the	service	container’s	filesystem:  	...snip... services: 		api: 							...snip... 						user:	'1000' 						configs: 								-	source:	env_specific_config 										target:	 config config.${DEPLOY_ENV:-prod}.yml				1 										uid:	'1000'																																							2  										gid:	'1000'   										mode:	0400																																								3  1	Overrides	default	target	file	path	is	 env_specific_config  2	Overrides	default	uid	and	gid	of	0,	to	match	service	user	with	uid 1000  3	Overrides	default	file	mode	of	0444,	read-only	for	all	users  In	this	example,	the	env_specific_config	resource	is mapped	into	the	greetings	service	container	with	several adjustments.	By	default,	config	resources	are	mounted	into	the container	filesystem	at	  ;	for	example,  env_specific_config.	This	example	maps env_specific_config	to	the	target	location  config config.$	{DEPLOY_ENV:-prod}.yml. Thus,	for	a	deployment	in	the	dev	environment,	the environment-specific	config	file	will	appear	at  config config.dev.yml.	The	ownership	of	this configuration	file	is	set	to	userid=1000	and groupid=1000.	By	default,	files	for	config	resources	are owned	by	the	user	ID	and	group	ID	0.	The	file	permissions	are also	narrowed	to	a	mode	of	0400.	This	means	the	file	is readable	by	only	the	file	owner,	whereas	the	default	is readable	by	the	owner,	group,	and	others	 0444 .  These	changes	are	not	strictly	necessary	for	this	application because	it	is	under	our	control.	The	application	could	be implemented	to	work	with	Docker’s	defaults	instead. However,	other	applications	are	not	as	flexible	and	may	have startup	scripts	that	work	in	a	specific	way	that	you	cannot change.	In	particular,	you	may	need	to	control	the configuration	filename	and	ownership	in	order	to   accommodate	a	program	that	wants	to	run	as	a	particular	user and	read	configuration	files	from	predetermined	locations. Docker’s	service	config	resource	mapping	allows	you	to accommodate	these	demands.	You	can	even	map	a	single config	resource	into	multiple	service	definitions	differently,	if needed.  With	the	config	resources	set	along	with	the	service	definition, let’s	deploy	the	application.  12.2.2.	Deploying	the	application  Deploy	the	greetings	application	with	the	dev	environment configuration	by	running	the	following	command:  DEPLOY_ENV=dev	docker	stack	deploy	\ 				--compose-file	docker-compose.yml	greetings_dev  After	the	stack	deploys,	you	can	point	a	web	browser	to	the service	at	http:  localhost:	8080 ,	and	should	see	a	welcome message	like	this:  Welcome	to	the	Greetings	API	Server! Container	with	id	642abc384de5	responded	at	2019-04-16	 00:24:37.0958326	+0000	UTC DEPLOY_ENV:	dev																																																																 1  1	The	value	“dev”	is	read	from	environment	variable.  When	you	run	docker	stack	deploy,	Docker	reads	the application’s	environment-specific	configuration	file	and stores	it	as	a	config	resource	inside	the	Swarm	cluster.	Then when	the	api	service	starts,	Swarm	creates	a	copy	of	those   files	on	a	temporary,	read-only	filesystem.	Even	if	you	set	the file	mode	as	writable	 for	example,	rw-rw-rw- ,	it	will	be ignored.	Docker	mounts	these	files	at	the	target	location specified	in	the	config.	The	config	file’s	target	location	can	be pretty	much	anywhere,	even	inside	a	directory	that	contains regular	files	from	the	application	image.	For	example,	the greetings	service’s	common	config	files	 COPY’d	into	app image 	and	environment-specific	config	file	 a	Docker	config resource 	are	both	available	in	the	 config	directory.	The application	container	can	read	these	files	when	it	starts	up,	and those	files	are	available	for	the	life	of	the	container.  On	startup,	the	greetings	application	uses	the DEPLOY_ENV	environment	variable	to	calculate	the	name	of the	environment-specific	config	file;	for	example,	 config  config.dev.yml.	The	application	then	reads	both	of	its	config files	and	merges	the	list	of	greetings.	You	can	see	how	the greetings	service	does	this	by	reading	the	api main.go	file in	the	source	repository.	Now,	navigate	to	the http:  localhost:8080 greeting	endpoint	and	make	several requests.	You	should	see	a	mix	of	greetings	from	the	common and	environment-specific	config.	For	example:  Hello	World! Orbis	Terrarum	salve! Hello	World! Hallo	Welt! Hola	Mundo!  Config	resources	vs.	config	images  You	may	recall	the	Configuration	Image	per	Deployment   Stage	pattern	described	in	chapter	10.	In	that	pattern, environment-specific	configurations	are	built	into	an	image that	runs	as	a	container,	and	that	filesystem	is	mounted	into	the “real”	service	container's	filesystem	at	runtime.	The	Docker config	resource	automates	most	of	this	pattern.	Using	config resources	results	in	a	file	being	mounted	into	the	service	task container	and	does	so	without	needing	to	create	and	track additional	images.	The	Docker	config	resource	also	allows	you to	easily	mount	a	single	config	file	into	an	arbitrary	location on	the	filesystem.	With	the	container	image	pattern,	it’s	best	to mount	an	entire	directory	in	order	to	avoid	confusion	about what	file	came	from	which	image.  In	both	approaches,	you’ll	want	to	use	uniquely	identified config	or	image	names.	However,	it	is	convenient	that	image names	can	use	variable	substitutions	in	Docker	Compose application	deployment	descriptors,	avoiding	the	resource- naming	problems	that	will	be	discussed	in	the	next	section.  So	far,	we	have	managed	config	resources	through	the convenience	of	a	Docker	Compose	deployment	definition.	In the	next	section,	we	will	step	down	an	abstraction	level	and use	the	docker	command-line	tool	to	directly	inspect	and manage	config	resources.  12.2.3.	Managing	config	resources	directly  The	docker	config	command	provides	another	way	to manage	config	resources.	The	config	command	has	several   subcommands	for	creating,	inspecting,	listing,	and	removing config	resources:	create,	inspect,	ls,	and	rm, respectively.	You	can	use	these	commands	to	directly	manage a	Docker	Swarm	cluster’s	config	resources.	Let’s	do	that	now.  Inspect	the	greetings	service’s env_specific_config	resource:  docker	config	inspect	greetings_dev_env_specific_config						1  1	Docker	automatically	prefixes	the	config	resource	with	the greetings_dev	stack	name.  This	should	produce	output	similar	to	the	following:  [ 				{ 								"ID":	"bconc1huvlzoix3z5xj0j16u1", 								"Version":	{ 												"Index":	2066 								}, 								"CreatedAt":	"2019-04-12T23:39:30.6328889Z", 								"UpdatedAt":	"2019-04-12T23:39:30.6328889Z", 								"Spec":	{ 												"Name":	"greetings_dev_env_specific_config", 												"Labels":	{ 																"com.docker.stack.namespace":	"greetings" 												}, 												"Data": 					 "Z3JlZXRpbmdzOgogIC0gJ09yYmlzIFRlcnJhcnVtIHNhbHZlIScKICAtICdCb25qb3VyIGx 	 					lIG1vbmRlIScK" 								} 				} ]  The	inspect	command	reports	metadata	associated	with	the config	resource	and	the	config’s	value.	The	config’s	value	is returned	in	the	Data	field	as	a	Base64-encoded	string.	This   data	is	not	encrypted,	so	no	confidentiality	is	provided	here. The	Base64	encoding	only	facilitates	transportation	and storage	within	the	Docker	Swarm	cluster.	When	a	service references	a	config	resource,	Swarm	will	retrieve	this	data from	the	cluster’s	central	store	and	place	it	in	a	file	on	the service	task’s	filesystem.  Docker	config	resources	are	immutable	and	cannot	be	updated after	they	are	created.	The	docker	config	command supports	only	create	and	rm	operations	to	manage	the cluster’s	config	resources.	If	you	try	to	create	a	config resource	multiple	times	by	using	the	same	name,	Docker	will return	an	error	saying	the	resource	already	exists:  $	docker	config	create	greetings_dev_env_specific_config	\ 				api config config.dev.yml Error	response	from	daemon:	rpc	error:	code	=	AlreadyExists	 				desc	=	config	greetings_dev_env_specific_config	already	 exists  Similarly,	if	you	change	the	source	configuration	file	and	try to	redeploy	the	stack	by	using	the	same	config	resource	name, Docker	will	also	respond	with	an	error:  $	DEPLOY_ENV=dev	docker	stack	deploy	\ 				--compose-file	docker-compose.yml	greetings_dev failed	to	update	config	greetings_dev_env_specific_config:	 				Error	response	from	daemon:	rpc	error:	code	=	 InvalidArgument	 				desc	=	only	updates	to	Labels	are	allowed  You	can	visualize	the	relationships	between	a	Docker	service and	its	dependencies	as	a	directed	graph,	like	the	simple	one shown	in	figure	12.4:   Figure	12.4.	Docker	services	depend	on	config	resources.  Docker	is	trying	to	maintain	a	stable	set	of	dependencies between	Docker	services	and	the	config	resources	they	depend on.	If	the	greetings_dev_env_specific_config resource	were	to	change	or	be	removed,	new	tasks	for	the greetings_dev	service	may	not	start.	Let’s	see	how Docker	tracks	these	relationships.  Config	resources	are	each	identified	by	a	unique	ConfigID. In	this	example,	the greetings_dev_env_specific_config	is	identified by	bconc1huvlzoix3z5xj0j16u1,	which	is	visible	in the	docker	config	inspect	command’s greetings_dev_env_	specific_config	output. This	same	config	resource	is	referenced	by	its	ConfigID	in the	greetings	service	definition.   Let’s	verify	that	now	by	using	the	docker	service inspect	command.	This	inspection	command	prints	only	the greetings	service	references	to	config	resources:  docker	service	inspect	\ 				--format	'{{	json	.Spec.TaskTemplate.ContainerSpec.Configs }}'	\ 				greetings_dev_api  For	this	service	instantiation,	the	command	produces	the following:  [ 		{ 				"File":	{ 	 						"Name":	" config config.dev.yml", 						"UID":	"1000", 						"GID":	"1000", 						"Mode":	256 				}, 				"ConfigID":	"bconc1huvlzoix3z5xj0j16u1", 				"ConfigName":	"greetings_dev_env_specific_config" 		} ]  There	are	a	few	important	things	to	call	out.	First,	the ConfigID	references	the greeetings_dev_env_specific_config	config resource’s	unique	config	ID, bconc1huvlzoix3z5xj0j16u1.	Second,	the	service- specific	target	file	configurations	have	been	included	in	the service’s	definition.	Also	note	that	you	cannot	create	a	config if	the	name	already	exists	or	remove	a	config	while	it	is	in	use. Recall	that	the	docker	config	command	does	not	offer	an update	subcommand.	This	may	leave	you	wondering	how	you   update	configurations.	Figure	12.5	illustrates	a	solution	to	the problem.  Figure	12.5.	Copy	on	deploy  The	answer	is	that	you	don’t	update	Docker	config	resources. Instead,	when	a	configuration	file	changes,	the	deployment process	should	create	a	new	resource	with	a	different	name and	then	reference	that	name	in	service	deployments.	The common	convention	is	to	append	a	version	number	to	the configuration	resource’s	name.	The	greetings application’s	deployment	definition	could	define	an env_specific_config_v1	resource.	When	the configuration	changes,	that	configuration	could	be	stored	in	a new	config	resource	named	env_specific_config_v2. Services	can	adopt	this	new	config	by	updating	configuration   references	to	this	new	config	resource	name.  This	implementation	of	immutable	config	resources	creates challenges	for	automated	deployment	pipelines.	The	issue	is discussed	in	detail	on	GitHub	issue	moby moby	35048.	The main	challenge	is	that	the	name	of	a	config	resource	cannot	be parameterized	directly	in	the	YAML	Docker	Compose deployment	definition	format.	Automated	deployment processes	can	work	around	this	by	using	a	custom	script	that substitutes	a	unique	version	into	the	Compose	file	prior	to running	the	deployment.  For	example,	say	the	deployment	descriptor	defines	a	config env_specific_config	_vNNN.	An	automated	build process	could	search	for	the	_vNNN	character	sequence	and replace	it	with	a	unique	deployment	identifier.	The	identifier could	be	the	deployment	job’s	ID	or	the	application’s	version from	a	version-control	system.	A	deploy	job	with	ID	3	could rewrite	all	instances	of	env_specific_config_vNNN	to env_specific_config_v3.  Try	this	config	resource	versioning	scheme.	Start	by	adding some	greetings	to	the	config.dev.yml	file.	Then	rename	the env_specific_config	resource	in	docker-compose.yml to	env_specific_config_v2.	Be	sure	to	update	the	key names	in	both	the	top-level	config	map	as	well	as	the	api service’s	list	of	configs.	Now	update	the	application	by deploying	the	stack	again.	Docker	should	print	a	message saying	that	it	is	creating	env_specific_config_v2	and updating	the	service.	Now	when	you	make	requests	to	the greeting	endpoint,	you	should	see	the	greetings	you	added   mixed	into	the	responses.  This	approach	may	be	acceptable	to	some	but	has	a	few drawbacks.	First,	deploying	resources	from	files	that	don’t match	version	control	may	be	a	nonstarter	for	some	people. This	issue	can	be	mitigated	by	archiving	a	copy	of	the	files used	for	deployment.	A	second	issue	is	that	this	approach	will create	a	set	of	config	resources	for	each	deployment,	and	the old	resources	will	need	to	be	cleaned	up	by	another	process. That	process	could	periodically	inspect	each	config	resource	to determine	whether	it	is	in	use	and	remove	it	if	it	is	not.  We	are	done	with	the	dev	deployment	of	the	greetings application.	Clean	up	those	resources	and	avoid	conflicts	with later	examples	by	removing	the	stack:  docker	stack	rm	greetings_dev  That	completes	the	introduction	of	Docker	config	and	its integration	into	delivery	pipelines.	Next,	we’ll	examine Docker’s	support	for	a	special	kind	of	configuration:	secrets.   12.3.	SECRETS—A	SPECIAL	KIND	OF CONFIGURATION  Secrets	look	a	lot	like	configuration	with	one	important difference.	The	value	of	a	secret	is	important	and	often	highly valuable	because	it	authenticates	an	identity	or	protects	data.	A secret	may	take	the	form	of	a	password,	API	key,	or	private encryption	key.	If	these	secrets	leak,	someone	may	be	able	to perform	actions	or	access	data	they	are	not	authorized	for.  A	further	complication	exists.	Distributing	secrets	in	artifacts such	as	Docker	images	or	configuration	files	makes controlling	access	to	those	secrets	a	wide	and	difficult problem.	Every	point	in	the	distribution	chain	needs	to	have robust	and	effective	access	controls	to	prevent	leakage.  Most	organizations	give	up	on	trying	to	deliver	secrets	without exposing	them	through	normal	application	delivery	channels. This	is	because	delivery	pipelines	often	have	many	points	of access,	and	those	points	may	not	have	been	designed	or configured	to	ensure	confidentiality	of	data.	Organizations avoid	those	problems	by	storing	secrets	in	a	secure	vault	and injecting	them	right	at	the	final	moment	of	application	delivery using	specialized	tooling.	These	tools	enable	applications	to access	their	secrets	only	in	the	runtime	environment.  Figure	12.6	illustrates	the	flow	of	application	configuration and	secret	data	through	application	artifacts.  Figure	12.6.	The	first	secret	problem   If	an	application	is	started	without	secret	information	such	as	a password	credential	to	authenticate	to	the	secret	vault,	how can	the	vault	authorize	access	to	the	application’s	secrets?	It can’t.	This	is	the	First	Secret	Problem.	The	application	needs help	bootstrapping	the	chain	of	trust	that	will	allow	it	to retrieve	its	secrets.	Fortunately,	Docker’s	design	for	clustering, services,	and	secret	management	solves	this	problem,	as illustrated	in	figure	12.7.  Figure	12.7.	The	Docker	swarm	cluster’s	chain	of	trust   The	core	of	the	First	Secret	Problem	is	one	of	identity.	In	order for	a	secret	vault	to	authorize	access	to	a	given	secret,	it	must first	authenticate	the	identity	of	the	requestor.	Fortunately, Docker	Swarm	includes	a	secure	secret	vault	and	solves	the trust	bootstrapping	problem	for	you.	The	Swarm	secret	vault	is tightly	integrated	with	the	cluster’s	identity	and	service management	functions	that	are	using	secure	communication channels.	The	Docker	service	ID	serves	as	the	application’s identity.	Docker	Swarm	uses	the	service	ID	to	determine which	secrets	the	service’s	tasks	should	have	access	to.	When you	manage	application	secrets	with	Swarm’s	vault,	you	can be	confident	that	only	a	person	or	process	with	administrative control	of	the	Swarm	cluster	can	provision	access	to	a	secret.  Docker’s	solution	for	deploying	and	operating	services	is	built on	a	strong	and	cryptographically	sound	foundation.	Each Docker	service	has	an	identity,	and	so	does	each	task	container running	in	support	of	that	service.	All	of	these	tasks	run	on	top of	Swarm	nodes	that	also	have	unique	identities.	The	Docker secret	management	functionality	is	built	on	top	of	this   foundation	of	identity.	Every	task	has	an	identity	that	is associated	with	a	service.	The	service	definition	references	the secrets	that	the	service	and	task	needs.	Since	service definitions	can	be	modified	by	only	an	authorized	user	of Docker	on	the	manager	node,	Swarm	knows	which	secrets	a service	is	authorized	to	use.	Swarm	can	then	deliver	those secrets	to	nodes	that	will	run	the	service’s	tasks.  Note  The	Docker	swarm	clustering	technology	implements	an advanced,	secure	design	to	maintain	a	secure,	highly	available, and	optimally	performing	control	plane.	You	can	learn	more about	this	design	and	how	Docker	implements	it	at https:  www.docker.com blog least-privilege-container- orchestration .  Docker	services	solve	the	First	Secret	Problem	by	using Swarm’s	built-in	identity	management	features	to	establish trust	rather	than	relying	on	a	secret	passed	via	another	channel to	authenticate	the	application’s	access	to	its	secrets.  12.3.1.	Using	Docker	secrets  Using	Docker	secret	resources	is	similar	to	using	Docker config	resources,	with	a	few	adjustments.  Again,	Docker	provides	secrets	to	applications	as	files mounted	to	a	container-specific,	in-memory,	read-only	tmpfs   filesystem.	By	default,	secrets	will	be	placed	into	the container’s	filesystem	in	the	 run secrets	directory.	This method	of	delivering	secrets	to	applications	avoids	several leakage	problems	inherent	with	providing	secrets	to applications	as	environment	variables.  Problems	with	secrets	as	environment	variables  The	most	important	and	common	problems	with	using environment	variables	as	secret	transfer	mechanisms	are	as follows:  You	can’t	assign	access-control	mechanisms	to	an	environment	variable.  This	means	any	process	executed	by	the	application	will	likely	have	access to	those	env	vars.	To	illustrate	this,	think	about	what	it	might	mean	for	an application	that	does	image	resizing	via	ImageMagick	to	execute	resizing operations	with	untrusted	input	in	the	environment	containing	the	parent application’s	secrets.	If	the	environment	contains	API	keys	in	well-known locations,	as	is	common	with	cloud	providers,	those	secrets	could	be stolen	easily.	Some	languages	and	libraries	will	help	you	prepare	a	safe process	execution	environment,	but	your	mileage	will	vary.  Many	applications	will	print	all	of	their	environment	variables	to	standard out	when	issued	a	debugging	command	or	when	they	crash.	This	means you	may	expose	secrets	in	your	logs	on	a	regular	basis.  Now	let’s	examine	how	to	tell	an	application	where	a	secret	or configuration	file	has	been	placed	into	a	container;	see	figure 12.8.  Figure	12.8.	Provide	location	of	secret	file	to	read	as	environment	variable   When	applications	read	secrets	from	files,	we	often	need	to specify	the	location	of	that	file	at	startup.	A	common	pattern for	solving	this	problem	is	to	pass	the	location	of	the	file containing	a	secret,	such	as	a	password	to	the	application,	as an	environment	variable.	The	location	of	the	secret	in	the container	is	not	sensitive	information,	and	only	processes running	inside	the	container	will	have	access	to	that	file,	file permissions	permitting.	The	application	can	read	the	file specified	by	the	environment	variable	to	load	the	secret.	This pattern	is	also	useful	for	communicating	the	location	of configuration	files.  Let’s	work	through	an	example;	we’ll	provide	the greetings	service	with	a	TLS	certificate	and	private	key	so that	it	can	start	a	secure	HTTPS	listener.	We	will	store	the certificate’s	private	key	as	a	Docker	secret	and	the	public	key as	a	config.	Then	we	will	provide	those	resources	to	the greeting	service’s	production	service	configuration. Finally,	we	will	specify	the	location	of	the	files	to	the   greetings	service	via	an	environment	variable	so	that	it knows	where	to	load	those	files	from.  Now	we	will	deploy	a	new	instance	of	the	greetings service	with	the	stack	configured	for	production.	The deployment	command	is	similar	to	the	one	you	ran	previously. However,	the	production	deployment	includes	an	additional	- -compose-file	option	to	incorporate	the	deployment configuration	in	docker-compose.prod.yml.	The	second change	is	to	deploy	the	stack	by	using	the	name greetings_prod	instead	of	greetings_dev.  Run	this	docker	stack	deploy	command	now:  DEPLOY_ENV=prod	docker	stack	deploy	--compose-file	docker- compose.yml	\ 		--compose-file	docker-compose.prod.yml	\ 		greetings_prod  You	should	see	some	output:  Creating	network	greetings_prod_default Creating	config	greetings_prod_env_specific_config service	api:	secret	not	found:	ch12_greetings-svc-prod- TLS_PRIVATE_KEY_V1  The	deployment	fails	because	the	ch12_greetings-svc- prod-TLS_PRIVATE_KEY_V1	secret	resource	is	not found.	Let’s	examine	docker-compose.prod.yml	and	determine why	this	is	happening.	Here	are	the	contents	of	that	file:  version:	'3.7' configs: 		ch12_greetings_svc-prod-TLS_CERT_V1: 				external:	true   	 secrets: 		ch12_greetings-svc-prod-TLS_PRIVATE_KEY_V1: 				external:	true 	 services: 	 		api: 						environment: 	 								CERT_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE: ' run secrets cert_private_key.pem' 								CERT_FILE:	' config svc.crt' 						configs: 								-	source:	ch12_greetings_svc-prod-TLS_CERT_V1 										target:	 config svc.crt 										uid:	'1000' 										gid:	'1000' 										mode:	0400 						secrets: 								-	source:	ch12_greetings-svc-prod-TLS_PRIVATE_KEY_V1 										target:	cert_private_key.pem 										uid:	'1000' 										gid:	'1000' 										mode:	0400  There	is	a	top-level	secrets	key	that	defines	a	secret	named ch12_greetings-svc-prod- TLS_PRIVATE_KEY_V1,	the	same	as	what	was	reported	in the	error.	The	secret	definition	has	a	key	we	have	not	seen before,	external:	true.	This	means	that	the	value	of	the secret	is	not	defined	by	this	deployment	definition,	which	is prone	to	leakage.	Instead,	the	ch12_greetings-svc- prod-TLS_PRIVATE_KEY_V1	secret	must	be	created	by	a Swarm	cluster	administrator	using	the	docker	CLI.	Once	the secret	is	defined	in	the	cluster,	this	application	deployment	can reference	it.  Let’s	define	the	secret	now	by	running	the	following command:   $	cat	api config insecure.key		\ 				docker	secret	create	ch12_greetings-svc-prod- TLS_PRIVATE_KEY_V1	- vnyy0gr1a09be0vcfvvqogeoj  The	docker	secret	create	command	requires	two arguments:	the	name	of	the	secret	and	the	value	of	that	secret. The	value	may	be	specified	either	by	providing	the	location	of a	file,	or	by	using	the	–	 hyphen 	character	to	indicate	that	the value	will	be	provided	via	standard	input.	This	shell	command demonstrates	the	latter	form	by	printing	the	contents	of	the example	TLS	certificate’s	private	key,	insecure.key,	into the	docker	secret	create	command.	The	command completes	successfully	and	prints	the	ID	of	the	secret: vnyy0gr1a09be0vcfvvqogeoj.  Warning  Do	not	use	this	certificate	and	private	key	for	anything	but working	through	these	examples.	The	private	key	has	not	been kept	confidential	and	thus	cannot	protect	your	data	effectively.  Use	the	docker	secret	inspect	command	to	view details	about	the	secret	resource	that	Docker	created:  $	docker	secret	inspect	ch12_greetings-svc-prod- TLS_PRIVATE_KEY_V1 [ 				{ 								"ID":	"vnyy0gr1a09be0vcfvvqogeoj", 								"Version":	{ 												"Index":	2172 								}, 	 								"CreatedAt":	"2019-04-17T22:04:19.3078685Z",   								"CreatedAt":	"2019-04-17T22:04:19.3078685Z", 								"UpdatedAt":	"2019-04-17T22:04:19.3078685Z", 								"Spec":	{ 												"Name":	"ch12_greetings-svc-prod- TLS_PRIVATE_KEY_V1", 												"Labels":	{} 								} 				} ]  Notice	that	there	is	no	Data	field	as	there	was	with	a	config resource.	The	secret’s	value	is	not	available	via	the	Docker tools	or	Docker	Engine	API.	The	secret’s	value	is	guarded closely	by	the	Docker	Swarm	control	plane.	Once	you	load	a secret	into	Swarm,	you	cannot	retrieve	it	by	using	the	docker CLI.	The	secret	is	available	only	to	services	that	use	it.	You may	also	notice	that	the	secret’s	spec	does	not	contain	any labels,	as	it	is	managed	outside	the	scope	of	a	stack.  When	Docker	creates	containers	for	the	greetings	service, the	secret	will	be	mapped	into	the	container	in	a	way	that	is almost	identical	to	the	process	we	already	described	for	config resources.	Here	is	the	relevant	section	from	the	docker- compose.prod.yml	file:  services: 				api: 						environment: 								CERT_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE: ' run secrets cert_private_key.pem' 								CERT_FILE:	' config svc.crt' 						secrets: 								-	source:	ch12_greetings-svc-prod-TLS_PRIVATE_KEY_V1 										target:	cert_private_key.pem 										uid:	'1000' 										gid:	'1000' 										mode:	0400 							...	snip	...   The	ch12_greetings-svc-prod- TLS_PRIVATE_KEY_V1	secret	will	be	mapped	into	the container,	in	the	file	cert_private_key.pem.	The default	location	for	secret	files	is	 run secrets .	This	application looks	for	the	location	of	its	private	key	and	certificate	in environment	variables,	so	those	are	also	defined	with	fully qualified	paths	to	the	files.	For	example,	the CERT_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE	environment	variable’s	value is	set	to	 run secrets cert_private_key.pem.  The	production	greetings	application	also	depends	on	a ch12_greetings_svc-prod-TLS_CERT_V1	config resource.	This	config	resource	contains	the	public, nonsensitive,	x.509	certificate	the	greetings	application will	use	to	offer	HTTPS	services.	The	private	and	public	keys of	an	x.509	certificate	change	together,	which	is	why	these secret	and	config	resources	are	created	as	a	pair.	Define	the certificate’s	config	resource	now	by	running	the	following command:  $	docker	config	create	\ 				ch12_greetings_svc-prod-TLS_CERT_V1	api config insecure.crt 5a1lybiyjnaseg0jlwj2s1v5m  The	docker	config	create	command	works	like	the secret	creation	command.	In	particular,	a	config	resource	can be	created	by	specifying	the	path	to	a	file,	as	we	have	done here	with	api config insecure.crt.	The	command completed	successfully	and	printed	the	new	config	resource’s unique	ID,	5a1lybiyjnaseg0jlwj2s1v5m.   Now,	rerun	the	deploy	command:  $	DEPLOY_ENV=prod	docker	stack	deploy	\ 				--compose-file	docker-compose.yml	\ 				--compose-file	docker-compose.prod.yml	\ 				greetings_prod Creating	service	greetings_prod_api  This	attempt	should	succeed.	Run	docker	service	ps greetings_prod_api	and	verify	that	the	service	has	a single	task	in	the	running	state:  ID																NAME														IMAGE NODE DESIRED	STATE								CURRENT	STATE											ERROR PORTS 93fgzy5lmarp								greetings_prod_api.1 dockerinaction ch12_greetings:api docker-desktop							Running													Running	2	minutes	ago  Now	that	the	production	stack	is	deployed,	we	can	check	the service’s	logs	to	see	whether	it	found	the	TLS	certificate	and private	key:  docker	service	logs	--since	1m	greetings_prod_api  That	command	will	print	the	greetings	service	application logs,	which	should	look	like	this:  Initializing	greetings	api	server	for	deployment	environment prod Will	read	TLS	certificate	private	key	from 					' run secrets cert_private_key.pem' chars	in	certificate	private	key	3272 Will	read	TLS	certificate	from	' config svc.crt' chars	in	TLS	certificate	1960 Loading	env-specific	configurations	from  config config.common.yml Loading	env-specific	configurations	from  config config.prod.yml    config config.prod.yml Greetings:	[Hello	World!

Similarly,	the	certificate	has	1,960 characters.	Finally,	the	greetings	application	reported	that it	is	starting	a	listener	for	HTTPS	traffic	on	port	8443	inside the	container.  Use	a	web	browser	to	open	https:  localhost:8443.	The example	certificate	is	not	issued	by	a	trusted	certificate authority,	so	you	will	receive	a	warning.	If	you	proceed through	that	warning,	you	should	see	a	response	from	the greetings	service:  Welcome	to	the	Greetings	API	Server! Container	with	id	583a5837d629	responded	at	2019-04-17 22:35:07.3391735	+0000	UTC DEPLOY_ENV:	prod  Woo-hoo!	The	greetings	service	is	now	serving	traffic	over HTTPS	using	TLS	certificates	delivered	by	Docker’s	secret management	facilities.	You	can	request	greetings	from	the service	at	https:  localhost:8443 greeting	as	you	did	before. Notice	that	only	the	three	greetings	from	the	common	config are	served.	This	is	because	the	application’s	environment- specific	configuration	file	for	prod,	config.prod.yml,	does	not add	any	greetings.  The	greetings	service	is	now	using	every	form	of   configuration	supported	by	Docker:	files	included	in	the application	image,	environment	variables,	config	resources, and	secret	resources.	You’ve	also	seen	how	to	combine	the usage	of	all	these	approaches	to	vary	application	behavior	in	a secure	manner	across	several	environments.   SUMMARY  This	chapter	described	the	core	challenges	of	varying application	behavior	at	deployment	time	instead	of	build	time. We	explored	how	you	can	model	this	variation	with	Docker’s configuration	abstractions.	The	example	application demonstrated	using	Docker’s	config	and	secret	resources	to vary	its	behavior	across	environments.	This	culminated	in	a Docker	Service	serving	traffic	over	https	with	an	environment- specific	dataset.	The	key	points	to	understand	from	this chapter	are:  Applications	often	must	adapt	their	behavior	to	the	environment	they	are deployed	into.  Docker	config	and	secret	resources	can	be	used	to	model	and	adapt application	behavior	to	various	deployment	needs.  Secrets	are	a	special	kind	of	configuration	data	that	is	challenging	to handle	safely.  Docker	Swarm	establishes	a	chain	of	trust	and	uses	Docker	service identities	to	ensure	that	secrets	are	delivered	correctly	and	securely	to applications.  Docker	provides	config	and	secrets	to	services	as	files	on	a	container- specific	tmpfs	filesystem	that	applications	can	read	at	startup.  Deployment	processes	must	use	a	naming	scheme	for	config	and	secret resources	that	enables	automation	to	update	services.   Chapter	13.

CLUSTERING	WITH	DOCKER	SWARM  Application	developers	and	operators	frequently	deploy services	onto	multiple	hosts	to	achieve	greater	availability	and scalability.	When	an	application	is	deployed	across	multiple hosts,	the	redundancy	in	the	application’s	deployment provides	capacity	that	can	serve	requests	when	a	host	fails	or is	removed	from	service.	Deploying	across	multiple	hosts	also permits	the	application	to	use	more	compute	resources	than any	single	host	can	provide.  For	example,	say	you	run	an	e-commerce	site	that	usually performs	well	on	a	single	host,	but	is	a	slow	during	big promotions	that	drive	peak	load	twice	as	high	as	normal.	This site	might	benefit	from	being	redeployed	onto	three	hosts. Then	you	should	have	enough	capacity	to	handle	peak	traffic even	if	one	host	fails	or	is	out	of	service	for	an	upgrade.	In	this chapter,	we	will	show	you	how	to	model	and	deploy	a	web API	across	a	cluster	of	hosts	managed	with	Swarm.  Docker	Swarm	provides	a	sophisticated	platform	for	deploying and	operating	a	containerized	application	across	a	set	of Docker	hosts.	Docker’s	deployment	tooling	automates	the process	for	deploying	a	new	Docker	service	to	the	cluster	or changes	to	an	existing	service.	Service	configuration	changes may	include	anything	declared	in	the	service	definition  docker-compose.yml 	such	as	image,	container	command, resource	limits,	exposed	ports,	mounts,	and	consumed	secrets. Once	deployed,	Swarm	supervises	the	application	so	that   problems	are	detected	and	repaired.	Additionally,	Swarm routes	requests	from	the	application’s	users	to	the	service’s containers.  In	this	chapter,	we	will	examine	how	Docker	Swarm	supports each	of	these	functions.	We	will	build	on	the	service, configuration,	and	secret	resources	explored	in	chapters	11	and 12.	We	will	also	leverage	your	fundamental	knowledge	of Docker	containers	 chapter	2 ,	resource	limits	 chapter	6 ,	and networking	 chapter	5 .  13.1.1.	Introducing	Docker	Swarm	mode  Docker	Swarm	is	a	clustering	technology	that	connects	a	set	of hosts	running	Docker	and	lets	you	run	applications	built	using Docker	services	across	those	machines.	Swarm	orchestrates the	deployment	and	operation	of	Docker	services	across	the collection	of	machines.	Swarm	schedules	tasks	according	to the	application’s	resource	requirements	and	machine capabilities.	The	Swarm	clustering	software	is	included	in	the Docker	Engine	and	command-line	tool.	You	can	enable Swarm	mode	and	start	using	Swarm	without	installing	any additional	components.	Figure	13.1	shows	how	the components	of	a	Docker	Swarm	deployment	relate	to	each other	and	how	the	machines	of	the	cluster	collaborate	to	run applications.  Figure	13.1.	Swarm	cluster	deployment   When	you	join	a	Docker	Engine	to	a	Swarm	cluster,	you specify	whether	that	machine	should	be	a	manager	or	a worker.	Managers	listen	for	instructions	to	create,	change,	or remove	definitions	for	entities	such	as	Docker	services, configuration,	and	secrets.	Managers	instruct	worker	nodes	to create	containers	and	volumes	that	implement	Docker	service instances.	Managers	continuously	converge	the	cluster	to	the state	you	have	declared	it	should	be	in.	The	control	plane connecting	the	cluster’s	Docker	Engines	depicts	the communication	of	the	desired	cluster	state	and	events	related to	realizing	that	state.	Clients	of	a	Docker	service	may	send requests	to	any	node	of	the	cluster	on	the	port	published	for that	service.	Swarm’s	network	mesh	will	route	the	request from	whichever	node	received	the	request	to	a	healthy	service container	that	can	handle	it.	Swarm	deploys	and	manages lightweight,	dedicated	load-balancer	and	network	routing components	to	receive	and	transport	network	traffic	for	each   published	port.	Section	13.3.1	explains	the	Swarm	network mesh	in	detail.	Let’s	deploy	a	cluster	to	work	through	the examples	in	this	chapter.  Swarm	clusters	can	be	deployed	in	many	topologies.	Each cluster	has	at	least	one	manager	to	safeguard	cluster	state	and orchestrate	services	across	workers.	Swarm	managers	require a	majority	of	the	managers	to	be	available	in	order	to coordinate	and	record	a	change	to	the	cluster.	Most	production Swarm	deployments	should	have	three	or	five	nodes	in	the manager	role.	Increasing	the	number	of	managers	will	improve availability	of	the	Swarm	control	plane,	but	will	also	increase the	time	it	takes	for	managers	to	acknowledge	a	change	to	the cluster.	See	the	Swarm	Admin	Guide	for	a	detailed explanation	of	the	trade-offs  https:  docs.docker.com engine swarm admin_guide  .	Swarm clusters	can	scale	reliably	to	hundreds	of	worker	nodes.	The community	has	demonstrated	tests	of	a	single	Swarm	with thousands	of	worker	nodes	 see	the	Swarm3K	project	at https:  dzone.com articles docker-swarm-lessons-from- swarm3k .  Swarm,	the	native	clustered	application	deployment	option provided	by	Docker,	supports	the	Docker	application	model well.	Many	people	will	find	Swarm	simpler	to	deploy,	use,	and manage	than	other	container	clustering	technologies.	You	may find	it	useful	to	deploy	small	Swarm	clusters	for	an	individual team	or	project.	A	large	Swarm	cluster	can	be	partitioned	into multiple	zones	by	using	labels,	and	then	you	can	place	service instances	into	the	proper	zone	by	using	scheduling	constraints. You	can	label	cluster	resources	with	metadata	meaningful	to   your	organization	such	as	environment=dev	or zone=private	so	the	cluster’s	actual	management	model matches	your	own	terminology.  13.1.2.	Deploying	a	Swarm	cluster  You	have	many	options	for	building	a	swarm	from	a	cluster	of nodes.	The	examples	in	this	chapter	use	a	Swarm	cluster	with five	nodes,	though	most	of	the	examples	work	on	a	single node,	such	as	Docker	for	Mac.	You	may	provision	a	Swarm cluster	however	you	like.	Because	of	the	wide	variety	of provisioning	options	and	the	rate	of	change,	we	recommend you	follow	an	up-to-date	guide	to	provision	a	Swarm	cluster on	your	favorite	infrastructure	provider.	Many	people	deploy test	clusters	with	docker-machine	on	cloud	providers	such as	DigitalOcean	and	Amazon	Web	Services.  The	examples	in	this	chapter	were	created	and	tested	using Play	with	Docker	 https:  labs.play-with-docker.com  .	On	the Play	with	Docker	site,	you	can	experiment	with	Docker	and learn	about	it	for	free.	The	cluster	was	created	using	the	Play with	Docker	template	that	provisions	three	manager	and	two worker	nodes.	You	will	need	at	least	two	workers	to	complete all	of	the	exercises	in	this	chapter.  The	general	process	for	deploying	a	Swarm	cluster	is	as follows:  1.	 Deploy	at	least	three	nodes	with	Docker	Engine	installed	and	running,  preferably	five.  2.	 Ensure	that	network	traffic	is	permitted	between	the	machines	on	the  following	ports	and	protocols:   1.	 TCP	port	2377	for	cluster	management	communications 2.	 TCP	and	UDP	port	7946	for	communication	among	nodes 3.	 UDP	port	4789	for	overlay	network	traffic  3.	 Initialize	a	Swarm	cluster	by	running	docker	swarm	init	on	a  4.	 Record	the	Swarm	cluster	join	tokens	or	display	them	again	with	docker  5.	 Join	the	manager	and	then	worker	nodes	to	the	cluster	with	docker  manager.  swarm	join-token.  swarm	join.   13.2.	DEPLOYING	AN	APPLICATION	TO	A	SWARM CLUSTER  In	this	section,	we	will	deploy	an	example	web	application with	a	common	three-tier	architecture.	The	application features	a	stateless	API	server	connected	to	a	PostgreSQL relational	database.	Both	the	API	server	and	database	will	be managed	as	Docker	services.	The	database	will	use	a	Docker volume	to	persist	data	across	restarts.	The	API	servers	will communicate	with	the	database	over	a	private,	secure	network. This	application	will	demonstrate	how	the	Docker	resources you	have	learned	about	in	previous	chapters	translate	to	a deployment	spanning	multiple	nodes.  13.2.1.	Introducing	Docker	Swarm	cluster	resource	types  Docker	Swarm	supports	nearly	all	of	the	concepts	discussed	in this	book,	as	illustrated	in	figure	13.2.	When	using	Swarm, these	resources	are	defined	and	managed	at	the	cluster	level.  Figure	13.2.	Docker	Swarm	resource	types   The	key	Docker	Swarm	resource	types	are	as	follows:  Services—	A	Docker	service	defines	the	application	processes	that	run	on the	Swarm	cluster’s	nodes.	Swarm	managers	interpret	the	service definition	and	create	tasks	that	are	executed	on	the	cluster’s	manager	and worker	nodes.	Services	are	introduced	in	chapter	11.  Tasks—	Tasks	define	a	containerized	process	that	Swarm	will	schedule and	run	once	until	completion.	A	task	that	exits	may	be	replaced	by	a	new task,	depending	on	the	restart	policy	defined	by	the	service.	Tasks	also specify	dependencies	on	other	cluster	resources	such	as	networks	and secrets.  Networks—	Applications	can	use	Docker	overlay	networks	for	traffic between	services.	Docker	networks	have	low	overhead,	so	you	can	create network	topologies	that	suit	your	desired	security	model.	Section	13.3.2 describes	overlay	networks.  Volumes—	Volumes	provide	persistent	storage	to	service	tasks.	These   volumes	are	bound	to	a	single	node.	Volumes	and	mounts	are	described	in chapter	4.  Configs	and	secrets—	Configurations	and	secrets	 chapter	12 	provide environment-specific	configurations	to	services	deployed	on	the	cluster.  The	example	application	uses	each	of	these	Docker	resource types.  13.2.2.	Defining	an	application	and	its	dependencies	by using	Docker	services  The	example	application	we	will	work	with	in	this	chapter	is	a simple	web	application	with	three	tiers:	a	load	balancer,	API server,	and	PostgreSQL	database.	We	will	model	this application	with	Docker	and	then	deploy	it	to	our	Swarm cluster.	Logically,	the	application	deployment	will	look	like figure	13.3.  Figure	13.3.	Logical	architecture	of	example	application  The	application	has	an	API	server	with	two	endpoints:	 	and  counter.	The	API	service	publishes	a	port	to	the	cluster’s edge	that	is	implemented	by	Swarm’s	built-in	load	balancer. Requests	to	the	 	endpoint	will	return	information	about	the container	that	handled	the	request.	The	 counter	endpoint will	increment	an	integer	with	each	request.	The	value	of	the counter	is	stored	in	a	PostgreSQL	database.  Let’s	define	the	application	a	piece	at	a	time	by	using	the   Docker	Compose	version	3	format	and	synthesize	the	concepts covered	in	previous	chapters.	After	that,	we	will	deploy	it	with the	docker	stack	command.	This	application	definition	is available	in	full	at https:  github.com dockerinaction ch13_multi_tier_app.git. Clone	that	repo	to	follow	along	as	the	application	is	explained piece	by	piece.  The	application	uses	two	networks,	a	public	network	handling requests	coming	from	external	clients,	and	a	private	network that	is	more	trusted.	These	networks	are	described	in	the docker-compose.yml	application	descriptor	as	follows:  version:	'3.7' 	 networks: 		public: 				driver:	overlay 				driver_opts: 						encrypted:	'true' 		private: 				driver:	overlay 				driver_opts: 						encrypted:	'true' 				attachable:	true  Note  The	value	true	is	quoted	for	driver_opts	because Docker	requires	a	string	or	number.	The	value	of	true	is unquoted	for	attachable	because	Docker	requires	a boolean.  Both	networks	are	defined	by	adding	named	entries	to	a	top-   level	networks	key	in	the	application	descriptor.	The	team	that built	this	application	has	an	end-to-end	encryption requirement.	The	application	definition	satisfies	a	large portion	of	that	requirement	by	encrypting	all	of	the	traffic	on the	networks	used	by	the	application.	The	only	remaining work	is	to	secure	communications	on	the	service’s	published port	by	using	TLS.	Section	13.3	explains	why	applications should	secure	the	published	ports,	and	chapter	12’s greetings	application	showed	one	way	to	do	this.	This highlights	an	interesting	feature	of	Swarm:	it	is	easy	to	satisfy many	transport	encryption	requirements	by	using	a	relatively simple,	auditable	configuration	in	the	deployment	descriptor.  Next,	the	database	needs	persistent	storage	for	its	data.	We define	a	Docker	volume	under	a	top-level	volumes	key:  volumes: 		db-data:  Notice	that	no	options	are	defined	for	this	volume.	Swarm	will use	Docker’s	built-in	local	volume	driver	to	create	it.	The volume	will	be	local	to	that	Swarm	node	and	not	replicated, backed	up,	or	shared	elsewhere.	Some	Docker	volume	plugins can	create	and	manage	volumes	that	persist	and	share	data across	nodes;	the	Docker	Cloudstor	and	REX-Ray	plugins	are good	examples.  Before	we	move	on	to	the	service	definition,	create	a	reference to	the	password	that	will	be	used	by	the	API	to	access	the PostgreSQL	database.	The	password	will	be	configured	in	the Swarm	cluster	as	one	of	the	first	steps	of	the	deployment   process.	Add	a	top-level	secrets	key	that	instructs	the password	to	be	retrieved	from	the	cluster’s	secret	resources:  secrets 		ch13_multi_tier_app-POSTGRES_PASSWORD: 				external:	true																											1  1	Retrieves	from	cluster’s	secret	resources  Now	we	are	ready	to	define	the	application’s	services.	Let’s start	with	the	database	by	defining	a	postgres	service	under a	top-level	services	key:  services: 		postgres: 						image:	postgres:9.6.6 						networks: 								-	private 						volumes: 								-	db-data: var lib postgresql data 						secrets: 								-	source:	ch13_multi_tier_app-POSTGRES_PASSWORD						1 										target:	POSTGRES_PASSWORD 										uid:	'999'																																									2 										gid:	'999' 										mode:	0400 						environment: 										POSTGRES_USER:	'exercise' 										POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE:	 ' run secrets POSTGRES_PASSWORD' 										POSTGRES_DB:	'exercise' 						deploy: 										replicas:	1																																								3 										update_config: 												order:	'stop-first' 										rollback_config: 												order:	'stop-first' 										resources: 												limits:  														cpus:	'1.00' 														memory:	50M 												reservations: 														cpus:	'0.25' 														memory:	50M   1	Injects	PostgreSQL	password	from	a	cluster-managed	secret  2	The	postgres	user	 uid:	999 	managed	by	the	container	needs	to	read the	file.  3	Ensures	at-most	one	instance	of	PostgreSQL	by	limiting	replicas	to	1 and	stopping	after	first	update	or	rollback	failure  This	database	service	will	use	the	official	PostgreSQL	image to	start	a	database.	That	PostgreSQL	container	will	attach	to  only 	the	private	network,	mount	the	db-data	volume, and	use	the	POSTGRES_*	environment	variables	to	initialize the	database.	The	POSTGRES_DB	and	POSTGRES_USER environment	variables	determine	the	name	of	the	database	and the	user	we	will	use	to	access	the	database,	respectively. However,	you	should	avoid	providing	secrets	such	as passwords	to	processes	via	environment	variables	because they	are	leaked	easily.  A	better	way	is	to	read	that	secret	from	a	file	that	is	managed safely.	Docker	supports	this	directly	with	its	secrets functionality.	The	PostgreSQL	image	also	has	support	for reading	sensitive	data	such	as	the	POSTGRES_PASSWORD from	a	file.	For	this	stack	definition,	Docker	will	retrieve	the PostgreSQL	password	from	the	cluster’s ch13_multi_tier_app-POSTGRES_PASSWORD	secret resource	definition.	Swarm	places	the	secret’s	value	in	a	file mounted	into	the	container	at  run secrets POSTGRES_PASSWORD.	The	PostgreSQL process	switches	to	a	user	with	user	ID	999	when	it	starts	up, so	the	secret	file’s	owner	is	configured	to	be	readable	by	that user.   Note  All	processes	that	execute	inside	a	Docker	container	can access	all	the	environment	variables	of	that	container. However,	access	to	data	in	files	is	controlled	by	file permissions.	So	nobody	can	read	a	$SECRET	environment variable,	but	not	the	 run secrets SECRET	file	unless	file ownership	and	permissions	permit	reading	by	nobody.	For details,	see	chapter	12,	which	explores	Docker	configurations and	secrets	in	detail.  Does	it	look	like	anything	is	missing	from	the	postgres service	definition?	One	thing	that	is	not	clear	is	how	clients will	connect	to	the	database.  When	using	a	Docker	overlay	network,	applications	connected to	a	given	network	will	be	able	to	communicate	with	each other	on	any	port.	No	firewalls	exist	between	applications attached	to	a	Docker	network.	Because	PostgreSQL	listens	on port	5432	by	default	and	no	firewall	is	present,	other applications	that	are	also	attached	to	that	private	network will	be	able	to	connect	to	the	postgres	service	on	that	port.  Now	let’s	add	a	service	definition	for	the	API	under	the services	key:  api: 						image:	${IMAGE_REPOSITORY:- dockerinaction ch13_multi_tier_app}:api 						networks: 								-	public 	   	 								-	private 						ports: 								-	'8080:80' 						secrets: 								-	source:	ch13_multi_tier_app-POSTGRES_PASSWORD 										target:	POSTGRES_PASSWORD 										mode:	0400 						environment: 								POSTGRES_HOST:	'postgres' 								POSTGRES_PORT:	'5432' 								POSTGRES_USER:	'exercise' 								POSTGRES_DB:	'exercise' 								POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE: ' run secrets POSTGRES_PASSWORD' 						depends_on: 								-	postgres 						deploy: 										replicas:	2 										restart_policy: 														condition:	on-failure 														max_attempts:	10 														delay:	5s 										update_config: 														parallelism:	1 														delay:	5s 										resources: 												limits: 														cpus:	'0.50' 														memory:	15M 												reservations: 														cpus:	'0.25' 														memory:	15M  The	API	servers	are	attached	to	both	the	public	and private	network.	Clients	of	the	API	server	issue	requests	to port	8080	of	the	cluster.	The	Swarm	network	routing	mesh will	forward	client	requests	from	the	edge	of	the	network	to	a task	and	ultimately	into	an	API	server	container	on	port	80. The	API	servers	connect	to	PostgreSQL,	which	is	attached	to only	the	private	network.	The	API	servers	are	configured	to connect	to	PostgreSQL	by	using	the	information	defined	in	the POSTGRES_*	environment	variables.   Notice	that	the	PostgreSQL	user’s	password	is	also	provided to	the	API	server	via	a	Docker	secret.	As	with	the	postgres service,	the	secret	is	mounted	into	each	API	service	container as	a	file.	Though	the	API	service	uses	an	image	built	from scratch	and	includes	only	a	static	Golang	binary,	the	secret mount	still	works	because	Docker	manages	the	underlying tmpfs	filesystem	mount	for	you.	Docker	goes	to	great lengths	to	help	you	manage	and	use	secrets	safely.  The	rest	of	the	API	service	definition	manages	the	specifics	of how	Swarm	should	deploy	the	service.	The	depends_on	key contains	a	list	of	other	services	that	the	API	server	depends	on —in	this	case,	postgres.	When	we	deploy	the	stack,	Swarm will	start	the	postgres	service	before	api.	The	deploy key	declares	how	Swarm	should	deploy	the	api	service across	the	cluster.  In	this	configuration,	Swarm	will	deploy	two	replicas	to	the cluster	and	try	to	keep	that	many	tasks	running	to	support	the service.	The	restart_policy	determines	how	Swarm handles	a	service	task	exiting	or	entering	a	failed	state, according	to	its	health	check.  Here,	Swarm	will	restart	the	task	when	it	fails	to	start.	Restart is	a	misnomer,	as	Swarm	will	actually	start	a	new	container rather	than	restart	the	failed	container.	Swarm	restarts	service tasks	an	infinite	number	of	times	by	default.	The	API	service’s configuration	restarts	tasks	up	to	10	times	with	a	5-second delay	between	each	restart.  Service	authors	should	think	through	their	restart	strategies   carefully	to	determine	how	long	and	how	many	attempts Swarm	should	make	to	start	a	service.	First,	it’s	rarely	useful to	try	indefinitely.	Second,	infinite	retry	processes	could exhaust	cluster	resources	that	are	consumed	when	new containers	start,	but	aren’t	cleaned	up	quickly	enough.  The	API	service	uses	a	simple	update_config	that	limits the	rollout	of	updates	to	the	service	to	one	task	at	a	time.	In this	configuration,	Swarm	will	update	the	service	by	shutting down	a	task	with	the	old	configuration,	start	one	with	the	new configuration,	and	wait	until	the	new	task	is	healthy	prior	to moving	on	to	replacing	the	next	task	in	the	service.	The	delay configuration	introduces	an	interval	between	task	replacement actions	to	keep	the	cluster	and	traffic	to	the	service	stable during	the	rollout.  Many	configuration	options	exist	for	restart,	update,	and rollback	configurations	that	were	discussed	in	chapter	11.	You can	fine-tune	these	to	complement	the	application’s	behavior and	create	a	robust	deployment	process.  13.2.3.	Deploying	the	application  In	this	section,	we	will	deploy	the	application	we’ve	defined	to a	Swarm	cluster.	We	will	use	the	docker	stack	command introduced	in	chapter	11	to	do	that.	Figure	13.4	shows	how this	command	will	be	communicated	to	the	cluster.  Figure	13.4.	Communication	path	for	Docker	control	plane   Docker	services,	networks,	and	other	swarm	resources	are managed	by	issuing	the	appropriate	docker	command	to	a manager	node	of	the	swarm	cluster.	When	you	issue	a command	with	the	docker	CLI,	it	will	connect	to	the	Docker Engine	API	and	request	updates	to	the	swarm	cluster’s	state. The	leader	of	the	swarm	will	orchestrate	the	changes	required to	converge	the	actual	application	resources	on	the	cluster	to the	desired	state.  If	you	issue	Docker	commands	to	manage	the	cluster	or	its resources	to	a	worker	node,	you	will	receive	an	error:  [worker1]	$	docker	node	ls Error	response	from	daemon:	This	node	is	not	a	swarm	manager. Worker nodes	can't	be	used	to	view	or	modify	cluster	state.	Please	run this command	on	a	manager	node	or	promote	the	current	node	to	a manager.   Open	a	command	shell	to	any	of	the	manager	nodes	in	your cluster.	List	the	cluster’s	nodes	with	docker	node	ls:  [manager1]	$	docker	node	ls ID																												HOSTNAME												STATUS AVAILABILITY								MANAGER	STATUS						ENGINE	VERSION 7baqi6gedujmycxwufj939r44	*			manager1												Ready Active														Reachable											18.06.1-ce bbqicrevqkfu8w4f9wli1tjcr					manager2												Ready Active														Leader														18.06.1-ce hdpskn4q93f5ou1whw9ht8y01					manager3												Ready Active														Reachable											18.06.1-ce xle0g72ydvj24sf40vnaw08n0					worker1													Ready Active																																		18.06.1-ce l6fkyzqglocnwc0y4va2anfho					worker2													Ready Active																																		18.06.1-ce [manager1]	$  In	the	preceding	output,	notice	that	the	command	was executed	from	the	node	named	manager1.	This	node	is operating	in	a	manager	role	but	is	not	currently	the	leader	of the	cluster.	When	a	cluster	management	command	is	issued	to this	node,	it	will	be	forwarded	to	the	leader	for	processing.  Use	Git	to	clone	the	application	to	the	manager	node	and change	into	the	ch13_multi_tier_app	directory:  git	clone https:  github.com dockerinaction ch13_multi_tier_app.git cd	ch13_multi_tier_app  We	are	now	ready	to	deploy	the	application	with	docker stack.	The	stack	subcommand	can	deploy	applications defined	in	two	formats.	The	first	format	is	the	Docker Compose	format	we	will	be	using.	The	second	is	the	older	and less	popular	Distributed	Application	Bundle	 DAB 	format. Because	we	are	using	the	Docker	Compose	format,	we	will   specify	the	path s 	to	the	compose	file	with	--compose- file.	Let’s	deploy	our	Compose	application	to	Swarm	now:  docker	stack	deploy	--compose-file	docker-compose.yml	multi- tier-app  The	application	deployment	should	fail	with	an	error indicating	that	ch13_multi_tier_app- POSTGRES_PASSWORD	was	not	found:  $	docker	stack	deploy	--compose-file	docker-compose.yml	multi- tier-app Creating	network	multi-tier-app_private Creating	network	multi-tier-app_public service	postgres:	secret	not	found:	ch13_multi_tier_app- POSTGRES_PASSWORD  The	docker	command	output	shows	Swarm	was	able	to create	the	networks,	but	not	the	services.	Swarm	requires	that all	cluster-level	resources	that	a	service	depends	on	exist	prior to	proceeding	with	the	deployment.	So	Docker	halted	the application	deployment	when	it	determined	a	resource dependency	was	missing.	The	resources	that	were	created	have been	left	as	is	and	can	be	used	in	subsequent	deployment attempts.	These	predeployment	checks	help	build	robust application	delivery	processes.	The	fail-fast	deployment behavior	helped	us	quickly	discover	a	missing	dependency.  The	missing	cluster-level	resource	that	this	application depends	on	is	the	ch13_multi_tier_app- POSTGRES_PASSWORD	secret.	Recall	that	the	application’s reference	to	that	secret	said	that	it	was	defined	externally:  secrets:   secrets: 		ch13_multi_tier_app-POSTGRES_PASSWORD: 				external:	true															Retrieve	from	cluster's secret	resources  In	this	context,	external	means	defined	outside	the application	deployment	definition	and	provided	by	Swarm. Let’s	store	the	application’s	database	password	as	a	Docker secret	in	the	Swarm	cluster	now:  echo	'mydbpass72'		docker	secret	create	\ 				ch13_multi_tier_app-POSTGRES_PASSWORD	-  Note  The	only	place	this	password	is	defined	is	in	this	Docker	secret managed	by	Swarm.	You	can	use	any	valid	PostgreSQL password	you	want.	Feel	free	to	change	it.	This	demonstrates how	easy	it	is	to	safely	handle	secrets	in	distributed applications	with	Swarm.  The	docker	secret	command	should	succeed	and	print the	random	identifier	that	Docker	assigned	to	manage	the secret.	You	can	verify	that	the	secret	was	created	by	listing	the secrets	in	your	cluster:  docker	secret	ls	--format	"table	{{.ID}}	{{.Name}}	 {{.CreatedAt}}"				1  1	Formats	output	as	a	table	with	secret	identifier,	name,	and	time since	creation	 optional    The	listing	should	show	the	secret	was	created	recently:  ID	NAME	CREATED  	ch13_multi_tier_app-POSTGRES_PASSWORD	6	seconds	ago  Now	let’s	try	deploying	the	stack	again:  [manager1]	$	docker	stack	deploy	\ 			--compose-file	docker-compose.yml	multi-tier-app Creating	service	multi-tier-app_postgres Creating	service	multi-tier-app_api  The	docker	stack	command	should	report	that	it	has created	two	Docker	services	for	the	multitier	app:	multi- tier-app_postgres	and	multi-tier-app_api.	List the	services	and	check	their	status:  docker	service	ls	\ 				--format	"table	{{.Name}}	{{.Mode}}	{{.Replicas}}"					1  1	Formats	output	as	a	table	with	service	name,	mode,	and	replicas  optional   That	command	will	produce	output	like	this:  NAME	MODE	REPLICAS multi-tier-app_api	replicated	2 2 multi-tier-app_postgres	replicated	1 1  Each	of	the	services	has	the	expected	number	of	replicas. There	is	one	task	for	PostgreSQL	and	two	tasks	for	the	API shown	in	the	REPLICAS	column.  You	can	check	that	the	api	service	started	up	correctly	by   inspecting	logs:  docker	service	logs	--follow	multi-tier-app_api  Each	api	task	should	log	a	message	saying	that	it	is initializing,	reading	the	PostgreSQL	password	from	a	file,	and listening	for	requests.	For	example:  $	docker	service	logs	--no-task-ids	multi-tier-app_api multi-tier-app_api.1@worker1					2019 02 02	21:25:22	\ 				Initializing	api	server multi-tier-app_api.1@worker1					2019 02 02	21:25:22	\ 				Will	read	postgres	password	from ' run secrets POSTGRES_PASSWORD' multi-tier-app_api.1@worker1					2019 02 02	21:25:22	\ 				dial	tcp:	lookup	postgres	on	127.0.0.11:53:	no	such	host multi-tier-app_api.1@worker1					2019 02 02	21:25:23	\ 				dial	tcp	10.0.0.12:5432:	connect:	connection	refused multi-tier-app_api.1@worker1					2019 02 02	21:25:25	\ 				Initialization	complete,	starting	http	service multi-tier-app_api.2@manager1				2019 02 02	21:25:22	\ 				Initializing	api	server multi-tier-app_api.2@manager1					2019 02 02	21:25:22	\ 				Will	read	postgres	password	from ' run secrets POSTGRES_PASSWORD' multi-tier-app_api.2@manager1					2019 02 02	21:25:22	\ 				dial	tcp:	lookup	postgres	on	127.0.0.11:53:	no	such	host multi-tier-app_api.2@manager1					2019 02 02	21:25:23	\ 				dial	tcp:	lookup	postgres	on	127.0.0.11:53:	no	such	host multi-tier-app_api.2@manager1					2019 02 02	21:25:25	\ 				Initialization	complete,	starting	http	service  The	docker	service	logs	  command	streams	log	messages	from	the	node	where	service tasks	are	deployed	to	your	terminal.	You	may	view	the	logs	of any	service	by	issuing	this	command	to	Docker	Engine	on	a manager	node,	but	not	a	worker.	When	you	view	service	logs, Docker	Engine	connects	to	the	engines	in	the	cluster	where	its tasks	have	run,	retrieves	the	logs,	and	returns	them	to	you.   From	the	log	messages,	we	can	see	that	these	api	tasks appear	to	be	running	on	the	worker1	and	manager1	nodes. Your	service	tasks	may	have	started	on	different	nodes.	We can	verify	this	with	the	docker	service	ps	command, which	lists	a	service’s	tasks.	Run	this:  docker	service	ps	\ 				--format	"table	{{.ID}}	{{.Name}}	{{.Node}}	 {{.CurrentState}}"	\					1 				multi-tier-app_api  1	Formats	output	as	a	table	with	essential	task	data	 optional   This	command	will	produce	output	like	this:  ID	NAME	NODE	CURRENT	STATE 5jk32y4agzst	multi-tier-app_api.1	worker1	Running	16	minutes ago nh5trkrpojlc	multi-tier-app_api.2	manager1	Running	16	minutes ago  The	docker	service	ps	command	reports	that	two	tasks are	running	for	the	api	service,	as	expected.	Notice	that	the tasks	are	named	in	the	form	 _<service name>. ;	for	example, multi-tier-app_api.1.	Each	task	also	gets	a	unique ID.	The	docker	service	ps	command	lists	the	tasks	and their	status	for	a	service	no	matter	where	they	are	running	on the	cluster.  By	contrast,	when	running	docker	container	ps	on	the manager1	node,	it	shows	only	the	single	container	running on	that	node:  $	docker	container	ps	--format	"table	{{.ID}}	{{.Names}}   $	docker	container	ps	--format	"table	{{.ID}}	{{.Names}} {{.Status}}" CONTAINER	ID	NAMES	STATUS 4a95fa59a7f8	multi-tier-app_api.2.nh5trkrpojlc3knysxza3sffl	\ 				Up	27	minutes	 healthy   The	container	name	for	a	service	task	is	constructed	from	the task	name	and	unique	task	ID.	Both	ps	commands	report	that this	task	is	running	and	healthy.	The	api	server’s	image defines	a	HEALTHCHECK,	so	we	can	be	confident	this	is	true.  Great—our	application	deployed	successfully,	and	everything looks	healthy!  Open	a	web	browser	and	point	it	to	port	8080	on	any	node	of your	cluster.	Play	with	Docker	users	should	have	an	8080 hyperlink	at	the	top	of	the	web	console.	You	can	also	use	a curl	command	to	issue	an	HTTP	request	from	one	of	the cluster	nodes	to	port	8080:  curl	http:  localhost:8080  The	api	server	should	respond	with	a	simple	message	similar to	the	following:  Welcome	to	the	API	Server!

In	the	preceding	example,	the	curl	program runs	on	one	of	the	cluster’s	nodes	and	sends	the	request	to	that node,	localhost,	on	port	8080.	As	there	are	no	firewalls preventing	curl	from	opening	a	socket	to	that	network location,	Docker	Swarm’s	service	mesh	will	handle	the connection	to	port	8080	and	route	the	request	to	a	live container.	We	will	investigate	how	requests	are	routed	to   Docker	services	in	more	detail	next.   13.3.	COMMUNICATING	WITH	SERVICES	RUNNING ON	A	SWARM	CLUSTER  Docker	makes	it	easy	for	clients	outside	a	Swarm	cluster	to connect	to	services	running	in	the	cluster.	Swarm	also	helps services	running	within	the	cluster	to	find	and	contact	each other	when	they	share	a	Docker	network.	In	this	section,	we will	first	explore	how	Docker	exposes	services	to	the	world outside	the	cluster.	Then	we	will	look	at	how	Docker	services communicate	with	each	other	by	using	Swarm’s	service discovery	and	overlay	networking	features.  13.3.1.	Routing	client	requests	to	services	by	using	the Swarm	routing	mesh  The	Swarm	routing	mesh	provides	a	simple	way	to	expose	a service	running	on	a	container	cluster	with	the	outside	world, which	is	one	of	Swarm’s	most	compelling	features.	The routing	mesh	combines	several	sophisticated	network	building blocks	to	publish	a	service	port.	Figure	13.5	depicts	the	logical network	topology	Swarm	creates	for	the	example	application.  Figure	13.5.	Swarm	network	components	for	example	app   Swarm	sets	up	a	listener	on	each	node	of	the	cluster	for	each published	service	port.	You	can	configure	the	port	to	listen	for TCP,	UDP,	or	both	kinds	of	traffic.	Client	applications	can connect	to	this	port	on	any	cluster	node	and	issue	requests.  Swarm	implements	this	listener	with	a	combination	of	Linux iptables	and	ipvs	features.	An	iptables	rule	redirects traffic	to	a	dedicated	virtual	IP	 VIP 	allocated	for	the	service. The	service’s	dedicated	VIP	is	made	available	across	the swarm	cluster	by	using	a	Linux	kernel	feature	called	IP Virtual	Server,	ipvs.	IPVS	is	a	transport-layer	load	balancer that	forwards	requests	for	TCP	or	UDP	services	to	their	real endpoints.	IPVS	is	not	an	application-layer	load	balancer	for protocols	such	as	HTTP.	Swarm	creates	a	VIP	for	each published	Service	port	using	ipvs.	It	then	attaches	the	VIP	to the	ingress	network,	which	is	available	across	the	Swarm cluster.  Returning	to	our	example	application,	when	traffic	reaches	a cluster	node	on	TCP	port	8080,	iptables	reroutes	that traffic	to	the	api	service	VIP	attached	to	the	ingress network.	IPVS	forwards	traffic	from	the	VIP	to	the	ultimate endpoints,	which	are	Docker	service	tasks.  Swarm’s	routing	mesh	will	handle	the	connection	from	the client,	connect	to	a	healthy	service	task,	and	forward	the client’s	request	data	to	the	service	task.	Figure	13.6	shows how	Swarm	routs	curl’s	HTTP	request	to	an	API	service task	and	back.  Figure	13.6.	Routing	an	HTTP	request	to	a	service	task   When	a	program	connects	to	a	published	port,	Swarm	will attempt	to	connect	to	a	healthy	task	for	that	service.	If	the service	has	been	scaled	to	zero	replicas	or	no	healthy	tasks exist,	the	routing	mesh	will	refuse	to	initiate	the	network connection.	Once	the	TCP	connection	is	established,	the	client may	move	on	to	the	next	stage	of	transmission.	In	the	case	of the	API	service,	the	client	writes	an	HTTP	GET	request	onto the	TCP	socket	connection.	The	routing	mesh	receives	that data	and	sends	it	to	the	task	handling	this	connection.  It’s	important	to	note	that	a	service	task	does	not	need	to	be running	on	the	node	that	handles	the	client’s	connection. Publishing	a	port	establishes	a	stable	ingress	point	for	a   Docker	service	that	is	independent	of	the	transient	locations	of that	service’s	tasks	within	the	Swarm	cluster.	You	can	inspect the	ports	published	by	a	service	with	docker	service inspect:  $	docker	service	inspect	--format="{{json .Endpoint.Spec.Ports}}"	\ 				multi-tier-app_api [ 		{ 				"Protocol":	"tcp", 				"TargetPort":	80, 				"PublishedPort":	8080, 				"PublishMode":	"ingress" 		} ]  This	output	indicates	that	multi-tier-app_api	has	a listener	attached	to	the	ingress	network	on	TCP	port	8080, and	that	traffic	will	be	routed	into	service	tasks	on	port	80.  Bypassing	the	routing	mesh  An	alternate	PublishMode	called	host	bypasses	the routing	mesh	and	attachment	to	the	ingress	network.	When using	this	mode,	clients	connect	directly	to	the	service	task	on a	given	host.	If	a	task	is	deployed	there,	it	can	handle	the connection;	otherwise,	the	connection	attempt	will	fail.  This	PublishMode	is	likely	most	appropriate	for	services that	are	deployed	in	global	mode	so	that	there	is	one,	and only	one,	task	for	a	particular	service	on	a	cluster	node.	This ensures	that	a	task	is	available	to	handle	requests	and	avoids port	collisions.	Global	services	are	explained	in	more	detail	in   section	13.4.3.  Clients	interact	with	the	example	application’s	API	service	by using	HTTP.	HTTP	is	an	application	protocol	 layer	7 	that	is transported	over	the	TCP IP	 layer	4 	networking	protocol. Docker	also	supports	services	that	listen	on	UDP IP	 layer	4 . The	Swarm	routing	mesh	relies	on	IPVS,	which	routes	and balances	network	traffic	at	layer	4.  The	distinction	between	routing	at	layer	4	versus	layer	7	is important.	Because	Swarm	routes	and	load-balances connections	at	the	IP	layer,	it	means	client	connections	will	be balanced	across	backend	service	tasks,	not	HTTP	requests. When	one	client	issues	many	requests	over	a	single connection,	all	of	those	requests	will	go	to	a	single	task,	and will	not	be	distributed	across	all	backend	service	tasks	as	you might	expect.	Note	that	Docker	Enterprise	Edition	supports load	balancing	of	the	HTTP	protocol	 layer	7 ,	and	third-party solutions	exist	as	well.  13.3.2.	Working	with	overlay	networks  Docker	Swarm	offers	a	type	of	network	resource	called	an overlay	network,	illustrated	in	figure	13.7.	This	network, whose	traffic	is	logically	segmented	from	other	networks,	runs on	top	of	another	network.	The	Docker	Engines	of	a	Swarm cluster	can	create	overlay	networks	that	connect	containers running	on	different	Docker	hosts.	In	a	Docker	overlay network,	only	the	containers	attached	to	that	network	can   communicate	with	other	containers	on	that	network.	An overlay	network	isolates	the	communication	between containers	attached	to	that	network	from	other	networks.  Figure	13.7.	Layered	view	of	overlay	networks  One	way	to	think	about	an	overlay	network	is	that	it	enhances the	user-defined	bridge	networks	described	in	chapter	5	to span	Docker	hosts.	Just	as	with	a	user-defined	bridge	network, all	containers	attached	to	an	overlay	network	can	communicate with	each	other	directly	as	peers.	A	special	example	of	an overlay	network	is	the	ingress	network.  The	ingress	network	is	a	special-purpose	overlay	network that	it	is	created	by	Docker	when	you	initialize	a	swarm.	The ingress	network’s	only	responsibility	is	to	route	traffic from	external	clients	connected	to	ports	published	by	Docker services	within	the	cluster.	This	network	is	managed	by Swarm,	and	only	Swarm	can	attach	containers	to	the ingress	network.	You	should	be	aware	that	the	default   configuration	of	the	ingress	network	is	not	encrypted.  If	your	application	needs	end-to-end	encryption,	all	services that	publish	ports	should	terminate	their	connections	with TLS.	TLS	certificates	can	be	stored	as	Docker	secrets	and retrieved	by	services	on	startup,	just	as	we	have	demonstrated with	passwords	in	this	chapter	and	TLS	certificates	in	chapter 12.  Next,	we	will	explore	how	Docker	helps	services	discover	and connect	to	each	other	on	a	shared	network.  13.3.3.	Discovering	services	on	an	overlay	network  Docker	services	use	the	Domain	Name	System	 DNS 	to discover	the	location	of	other	Docker	services	on	a	Docker network	that	they	share.	A	program	can	connect	to	a	Docker service	if	it	knows	the	name	of	that	service.	In	our	example application,	the	api	server	is	configured	with	the	name	of	the database	service	via	the	POSTGRES_HOST	environment variable:  api: 			...	snip	... 						environment: 								POSTGRES_HOST:	'postgres'  When	an	api	task	creates	a	connection	to	the	PostgreSQL database,	it	will	resolve	the	postgres	name	to	an	IP	by using	DNS.	Containers	attached	to	a	Docker	overlay	network are	automatically	configured	by	Docker	to	perform	DNS lookups	via	a	special	resolver,	127.0.0.11.	This	is	also	true	for   user-defined	bridge	and	MACVLAN	networks.	The	Docker Engine	handles	DNS	lookups	made	to	127.0.0.1.	If	the	name resolution	request	is	for	a	Docker	service	that	is	present	on	that network,	Docker	will	respond	with	the	location	of	that service’s	virtual	IP.	If	the	lookup	is	for	another	name,	Docker will	forward	the	request	on	to	the	normal	DNS	resolver	for that	container	host.  In	our	example	application,	that	means	when	the	api	service looks	up	postgres,	the	Docker	Engine	on	that	host	will respond	with	the	virtual	IP	of	the	postgres	service endpoint;	for	example,	10.0.27.2.	The	api	database connection	driver	can	establish	a	connection	to	this	virtual	IP, and	Swarm	will	route	the	connection	to	the	postgres service	task,	which	could	be	at	10.0.27.3.	You	may	have expected	this	convenient	name	resolution	and	network	routing functionality	to	exist,	but	not	all	container	orchestrators	work this	way.  If	you	recall	figure	13.5	shown	previously,	you	may	also	have an	explanation	for	something	that	looked	unusual.	Figure	13.8 reproduces	that	diagram	here.  Figure	13.8.	Swarm	network	components	for	example	app   The	api	service	has	three	virtual	IPs	establishing	its	presence on	each	of	three	overlay	networks	it	is	attached	to:	ingress, multi-tier-app_public,	and	multi-tier- app_private.	If	you	inspect	the	api	service’s	endpoints, you	should	see	output	that	verifies	this	with	VirtualIPs	on those	three	networks:  docker	service	inspect	--format	'{{	json	.Endpoint.VirtualIPs	 }}'	\ 				multi-tier-app_api [ 		{ 				"NetworkID":	"5oruhwaq4996xfpdp194k82td",				1 				"Addr":	"10.255.0.8 16" 		}, 		{ 				"NetworkID":	"rah2lj4tw67lgn87of6n5nihc",				2 				"Addr":	"10.0.2.2 24" 		}, 		{ 				"NetworkID":	"vc12njqthcq1shhqtk4eph697",				3 				"Addr":	"10.0.3.2 24" 		} ]  1	ingress	network  2	multi-tier-app_private	network  3	multi-tier-app_public	network  Follow	along	with	a	little	experiment	that	demonstrates	the discoverability	of	services	attached	to	a	network	and	even	the containers	behind	them.	Start	a	shell	and	attach	it	to	the multi-tier-app_private	network:  docker	container	run	--rm	-it	--network	multi-tier-app_private \ 				alpine:3.8	sh   We	can	attach	our	shell	container	to	the	application’s private	network	because	it	was	defined	as	attachable:  private: 				driver:	overlay 				driver_opts: 						encrypted:	"true" 				attachable:	true  By	default,	only	Swarm	can	attach	containers	for	service	tasks to	a	network.	This	private	network	was	made	attachable specifically	for	this	service	discovery	exercise.  Ping	the	postgres	service	once.	You	should	see	output	like this:   		ping	-c	1	postgres PING	postgres	 10.0.2.6 :	56	data	bytes 64	bytes	from	10.0.2.6:	seq=0	ttl=64	time=0.110	ms 	 ---	postgres	ping	statistics	--- 1	packets	transmitted,	1	packets	received,	0%	packet	loss round-trip	min avg max	=	0.110 0.110 0.110	ms  Now	ping	the	api	service:   		ping	-c	1	api PING	api	 10.0.2.2 :	56	data	bytes 64	bytes	from	10.0.2.2:	seq=0	ttl=64	time=0.082	ms 	 ---	api	ping	statistics	--- 1	packets	transmitted,	1	packets	received,	0%	packet	loss round-trip	min avg max	=	0.082 0.082 0.082	ms  Let’s	use	Netcat	to	issue	a	request	manually	from	your	shell	on the	private	network	to	the	api	service:   $	printf	'GET	 	HTTP 1.0\nHost:	api\n\n'		nc	api	80					1  1	Creates	an	HTTP	request	and	pipes	through	Netcat	to	the	API  You	should	see	output	similar	to	that	in	the	previous	section:  HTTP 1.0	200	OK Connection:	close Content-Type:	text plain;	charset=utf-8 Date:	Wed,	13	Feb	2019	05:21:43	GMT Content-Length:	98 	 Welcome	to	the	API	Server! Server	82f4ab268c2a	responded	at	2019-02-13	05:21:43.3537073 +0000	UTC  We	successfully	issued	a	request	to	the	api	service	from	a shell	attached	to	the	private	network.	This	works	because the	api	service	is	attached	to	the	private	network	in addition	to	the	public	and	ingress	networks.	You	can also	connect	to	the	PostgreSQL	DB	from	your	shell:   		nc	-vz	postgres	5432 postgres	 10.0.2.6:5432 	open  This	Netcat	command	opens	a	socket	to	the	postgres hostname	on	port	5432	and	then	closes	it	right	away.	Netcat’s output	indicates	that	it	succeeded	in	connecting	to	the postgres	VIP,	10.0.2.6.	This	might	surprise	you.	After	all, if	you	review	the	postgres	service	definition,	you	can confirm	that	we	never	published	or	exposed	any	ports.	What’s going	on	here?  Communication	between	containers	attached	to	a	given   Docker	network	is	completely	open.	There	are	no	firewalls between	containers	on	a	Docker	overlay	network.	Because	the PostgreSQL	server	is	listening	on	port	5432	and	is	attached	to the	private	network,	any	other	container	attached	to	that network	can	connect	to	it.  This	behavior	might	be	convenient	in	some	cases.	However, you	may	need	to	approach	access	control	between	connected services	differently	than	you	are	accustomed	to.	We	will discuss	some	ideas	for	isolating	service-to-service communications	next.  13.3.4.	Isolating	service-to-service	communication	with overlay	networks  Many	people	control	access	to	a	service	by	restricting	the network	connections	that	can	be	made	to	that	service.	For example,	it	is	common	to	use	a	firewall	that	permits	traffic	to flow	from	service	A	to	service	B,	but	not	permit	traffic	in	the reverse	direction	from	B	to	A.	This	approach	does	not	translate well	to	Docker	overlay	networks	because	there	are	no	firewalls between	peers	connected	to	a	given	network.	Traffic	flows freely	in	both	directions.	The	only	access-control	mechanism available	for	an	overlay	network	is	attachment	 or	not 	to	the network.  However,	you	can	achieve	substantial	isolation	of	application traffic	flows	with	Docker	overlay	networks.	Overlay	networks are	lightweight	and	easy	to	create	with	Swarm	so	they	can	be used	as	a	design	tool	to	create	secure	application communication	topologies.	You	can	use	fine-grained,   application-specific	networks	for	your	application deployments	and	avoid	sharing	services	to	achieve	isolation. The	example	application	demonstrates	this	approach,	with	the exception	of	making	the	private	network	attachable.  The	key	point	to	remember	is	that	while	traffic	flows	on	a tightly	scoped	network	may	be	isolated	to	a	few	containers, there	is	no	such	thing	as	using	a	network	identity	to authenticate	and	authorize	traffic.	When	an	application	needs to	control	access	to	its	functionality,	the	application	must verify	the	identity	and	authorization	of	clients	at	the application	level.	The	example	application	controls	access	to the	postgres	database	by	using	the	PostgreSQL	user	and password.	This	ensures	that	only	the	api	service	can	interact with	the	database	in	our	deployment.	The	api	service	is meant	to	be	used	anonymously,	so	it	does	not	implement authentication,	but	it	certainly	could.  One	challenge	you	may	run	into	is	integrating	centralized, shared	services	such	as	a	logging	service.	Suppose	an application	such	as	our	example	and	a	centralized	logging service	are	attached	to	a	shared	network.	Docker	networks would	enable	the	logging	service	to	contact	the	api	or postgres	service	if	it	 or	an	attacker 	chooses	to	do	so.  The	solution	to	this	problem	is	to	deploy	the	centralized logging	service	or	other	shared	services	as	a	Docker	service that	publishes	a	port.	Swarm	will	set	up	a	listener	for	the logging	service	on	the	ingress	network.	Clients	running inside	the	cluster	can	connect	to	this	service	like	any	other published	service.	Connections	from	tasks	and	containers   running	inside	the	cluster	will	be	routed	to	the	logging	service as	described	in	section	13.3.1.	Because	the	logging	service’s listener	will	be	available	on	every	node	of	the	Swarm	cluster, the	logging	service	should	authenticate	its	clients.  Let’s	demonstrate	this	idea	with	a	simple	echo	service	that replies	with	whatever	input	you	send	it.	First	create	the service:  docker	service	create	--name	echo	--publish	'8000:8' busybox:1.29	\ 				nc	-v	-lk	-p	8	-e	 bin cat  If	you	send	data	to	the	echo	service	using	port	8000	of	a cluster	node	using	Netcat	 nc :  echo	"Hello	netcat	my	old	friend,	I've	come	to	test	connections	 again."	\ 					nc	-v	-w	3	192.168.1.26	8000																																									 1  1	Replace	192.168.1.26	with	the	IP	of	one	of	your	cluster’s	nodes	or	use $ hostname	-i 	to	substitute	the	current	host	IP	on	Linux.  Netcat	should	print	a	response	similar	to	this:  192.168.1.26	 192.168.1.26:8000 	open Hello	netcat	my	old	friend,	I've	come	to	test	connections again.  Clients	should	connect	to	shared	services	by	using	a	port published	by	that	service.	Switch	to	or	reopen	the	shell	we created	in	the	previous	section	so	we	can	verify	a	few	things:  docker	container	run	--rm	-it	--network	multi-tier-app_private   Then,	if	you	try	to	ping	the	echo	service,	the	ping	will	report an	error:  \ 				alpine:3.8	sh   	$	ping	-c	1	echo ping:	bad	address	'echo'  The	same	occurs	with	nslookup	when	trying	to	resolve	the hostname	echo:   	$	nslookup	echo nslookup:	can't	resolve	' null ':	Name	does	not	resolve  The	echo	service’s	name	doesn’t	resolve	when	attached	to	the multi-tier-app_private	network.	The	api	service needs	to	connect	to	the	port	published	by	the	echo	service	at the	cluster’s	edge,	just	like	processes	running	outside	the Swarm	cluster.	The	only	route	to	the	echo	service	is	through the	ingress	network.  We	can	say	a	few	good	things	about	this	design.	First,	all clients	reach	the	echo	service	in	a	uniform	way,	through	a published	port.	Second,	because	we	didn’t	join	the	echo service	to	any	networks	 besides	the	implicit	ingress network	join ,	it	is	isolated	and	cannot	connect	to	other services,	except	for	those	that	are	published.	Third,	Swarm	has pushed	application	authentication	responsibilities	into	the application	layer,	where	they	belong.  One	of	the	main	implications	with	this	design	is	that	an   application	described	with	Docker	Compose	may	rely	on	two sets	of	names	for	services	and	their	locations.	First,	some services	are	scoped	to	and	defined	within	the	application’s deployment	 for	example,	api	depends	on	postgres . Second,	there	are	services	such	as	the	echo	service	that	an application	may	depend	on,	but	that	are	managed	with	a different	deployment	life	cycle	and	have	a	different	scope. These	latter	services	may	be	shared	by	many	applications. This	second	kind	of	service	needs	to	be	registered	with	a registry	such	as	the	corporate-wide	DNS	so	that	applications can	discover	its	location.	Next	we	will	examine	how	client connections	are	balanced	behind	a	service	VIP	after	its location	has	been	discovered.  13.3.5.	Load	balancing  Let’s	explore	how	Docker	client	connections	are	balanced across	a	Docker	service’s	tasks.	Clients	usually	connect	to Docker	services	through	a	virtual	IP.	Docker	services	have	a property	called	endpoint-mode	that	defaults	to	vip.	We have	been	using	this	default	vip	endpoint	mode	for	all	of	our examples	so	far.	When	a	service	uses	the	vip	endpoint	mode, clients	will	access	the	service	through	the	VIP.	Connections	to that	VIP	will	be	load-balanced	automatically	by	Docker.  For	example,	in	section	13.3.3,	we	attached	a	shell	to	the multi-tier-app_private	network	and	used	Netcat	to issue	an	HTTP	request	to	the	api.	When	Netcat	resolved	the api	hostname	to	an	IP,	Docker’s	internal	DNS	replied	with the	VIP	of	the	api	service.	In	that	case,	more	than	one	healthy service	task	was	available.	Docker’s	network	routing   implementation	is	responsible	for	distributing	connections	to the	service	VIP	equally	between	the	healthy	tasks	behind	the VIP.  Docker’s	network-based	load-balancing	implementation	is used	for	all	traffic	routed	through	a	VIP	endpoint.	That	traffic could	be	from	an	internal	overlay	network	or	come	in	through a	port	published	to	the	ingress	network.  Docker	does	not	guarantee	which	service	task	will	handle	a client’s	request.	Even	when	a	client	is	running	on	the	same node	as	a	healthy	service	task,	the	client’s	request	may	go	to	a healthy	task	on	another	node.	This	is	true	even	for	services deployed	in	global	mode	 distinct	from	endpoint	mode , where	an	instance	runs	on	each	cluster	node.   13.4.	PLACING	SERVICE	TASKS	ON	THE	CLUSTER  In	this	section,	we	will	investigate	how	Swarm	places	tasks around	the	cluster	and	tries	to	run	the	desired	number	of service	replicas	within	declared	constraints.	First,	we	will introduce	the	coarse-grained	controls	Swarm	has	for	managing task	placement.	Then	we’ll	show	you	how	to	control	the placement	of	tasks	by	using	affinity	and	anti-affinity	to	built-in and	operator-specified	node	labels.  We	will	use	a	five-node	swarm	cluster	created	from	a	Play with	Docker	template,	depicted	in	figure	13.9.  Figure	13.9.	The	test	Swarm	cluster  This	cluster	has	three	manager	nodes	and	two	worker	nodes, which	are	named:  manager1   manager2  manager3  worker1  worker2  13.4.1.	Replicating	services  The	default,	and	most	commonly	used,	deployment	mode	for	a Docker	service	is	replicated.	Swarm	will	try	to	keep	the number	of	replicas	specified	in	a	service’s	definition	running at	all	times.	Swarm	continually	reconciles	the	desired	state	of the	service	specified	by	the	Docker	Compose	definition	or docker	service	command,	and	the	state	of	the	service’s tasks	on	the	cluster.	This	reconciliation	loop,	illustrated	in figure	13.10,	will	continuously	start	or	stop	tasks	to	match	so that	the	service	has	the	desired	number	of	healthy	replicas.  Figure	13.10.	Event	reconciliation	loop   Replicating	a	service	is	useful	because	you	can	scale	the service	to	as	many	replicas	as	needed	to	handle	the	load	and that	your	cluster	has	resources	to	support.  In	this	mode,	Swarm	will	schedule	a	service	task	to	start	on	a cluster	node	that	has	sufficient	compute	resources	 memory, CPU 	and	that	satisfies	the	service’s	labelled	constraints. Swarm	tries	to	spread	the	service’s	tasks	across	the	cluster’s nodes.	This	strategy	is	helpful	for	improving	service availability	and	smoothing	load	across	nodes.	We	will	control where	tasks	run	in	the	next	section.	For	now,	let’s	see	what happens	when	we	start	scaling	our	example	application’s	api service.  The	api	service	is	configured	to	have	two	replicas	by	default. The	deployment	definition	also	reserves	and	limits	the	CPU   and	memory	resources	that	each	container	can	use:  						deploy: 										replicas:	2 										restart_policy: 														condition:	on-failure 														max_attempts:	10 														delay:	5s 										update_config: 														parallelism:	1 														delay:	5s 										resources: 												limits: 														cpus:	'0.50' 														memory:	15M 												reservations: 														cpus:	'0.25' 														memory:	15M  When	Swarm	schedules	each	api	task,	it	will	look	for	a	node with	at	least	15	MB	of	memory	and	0.25	CPUs	that	have	not been	reserved	for	other	tasks.	Once	a	node	with	sufficient resources	has	been	identified,	Swarm	will	create	a	container for	the	task	that	is	limited	to	 again 	15	MB	of	memory	and may	use	up	to	0.5	CPUs.  In	aggregate,	the	api	service	begins	with	two	replicas	that reserve	a	total	of	0.5	CPUs	and	30	MB	of	memory.	Now	let’s scale	up	our	service	a	bit	with	five	replicas:  docker	service	scale	multi-tier-app_api=5  The	service	now	reserves	75	MB	of	memory	and	1.25	CPUs	in aggregate.	Swarm	was	able	to	find	resources	for	the	api service’s	tasks	and	spread	them	across	this	cluster:  $	docker	service	ps	multi-tier-app_api	\ 				--filter	'desired-state=running'	\   				--format	'table	{{.ID}}	{{.Name}}	{{.Node}} {{.CurrentState}}' ID											NAME																	NODE					CURRENT	STATE dekzyqgcc7fs	multi-tier-app_api.1	worker1		Running	4	minutes ago 3el58dg6yewv	multi-tier-app_api.2	manager1	Running	5	minutes ago qqc72ylzi34m	multi-tier-app_api.3	manager3	Running	about	a minute	ago miyugogsv2s7	multi-tier-app_api.4	manager2	Starting	4	seconds ago zrp1o0aua29y	multi-tier-app_api.7	worker1		Running	17	minutes ago  Now	let’s	demonstrate	what	it	looks	like	when	a	service reserves	all	of	a	cluster’s	resources.	You	should	follow	along only	if	you	are	using	a	cluster	where	it	is	OK	for	you	to exhaust	cluster	resources	and	prevent	other	tasks	from	being scheduled.	We’ll	undo	all	of	this	when	we’re	done,	but	at some	point,	no	new	tasks	that	reserve	CPU	can	be	scheduled. We	recommend	that	you	do	not	run	this	resource	exhaustion exercise	on	Play	with	Docker	 PWD 	because	the	underlying machines	are	shared	by	everyone	using	PWD.  First,	let’s	increase	the	CPU	reservation	of	our	api	tasks	from a	quarter	of	a	CPU	to	an	entire	CPU:  docker	service	update	multi-tier-app_api	--reserve-cpu	1.0	-- limit-cpu	1.0  You	will	see	Docker	shuffling	tasks	around	as	it	re-creates	the containers	for	each	task	with	the	new	limits	on	a	node	with capacity.  Now	let’s	try	scaling	the	service	to	a	larger	number	of	replicas that	will	exhaust	the	cluster’s	available	resources.	For   example,	if	you’re	running	a	five-node	cluster	and	each	node has	2	CPUs,	then	there	should	be	10	CPUs	reservable	in	total.  The	following	output	comes	from	a	cluster	with	10	reservable CPUs.	The	postgres	service	has	reserved	1	CPU.	The	api service	can	be	scaled	successfully	to	9	replicas:  $	docker	service	scale	multi-tier-app_api=9 multi-tier-app_api	scaled	to	9 overall	progress:	9	out	of	9	tasks 1 9:	running [==================================================>] ...	snip	... 9 9:	running [==================================================>] verify:	Service	converged  All	10	CPUs	are	now	reserved	by	the	api	and	postgres services.	When	scaling	the	service	to	10	replicas,	the	docker program	appears	to	hang:  docker	service	scale	multi-tier-app_api=10 multi-tier-app_api	scaled	to	10 overall	progress:	9	out	of	10	tasks 1 10:	running			 [==================================================>] ...	snip	... 10 10:	no	suitable	node	 insufficient	resources	on	5	nodes 						 1  1	Insufficient	resources	to	create	the	10th	api	task  The	output	reports	there	are	insufficient	resources	on	the cluster’s	five	nodes	to	launch	a	10th	task.	The	trouble	occurs when	Swarm	tries	to	schedule	a	task	for	the	10th	api	service task	slot.	When	you	run	the	cluster	out	of	reservable	resources, you	will	need	to	interrupt	the	docker	stack	deploy   command	with	a	^C	keystroke	to	get	your	terminal	back	or wait	for	the	command	to	time	out.	The	Docker	command	will suggest	that	you	run	docker	service	ps	multi- tier-app_api	to	get	more	info	and	check	whether	the service	converges.  Go	ahead	and	do	that	now	and	verify	that	api	tasks	are distributed	across	all	of	the	cluster	nodes	and	Swarm	is	unable to	schedule	the	last	task.	In	this	case,	we	know	the	cluster	will never	converge	unless	we	increase	cluster	capacity	or	reduce the	desired	number	of	replicas.	Let’s	revert	our	changes.  Autoscaling	services  Docker	Swarm	does	not	support	autoscaling	services	by	using built-in	functionality.	Third-party	solutions	can	use	resource usage	metrics	such	as	CPU	or	memory	utilization	or application-level	metrics	such	as	HTTP	requests	per	task.	The Docker	Flow	project	is	a	good	place	to	start, https:  monitor.dockerflow.com auto-scaling .  We	have	a	few	options	for	reverting	the	scaling	changes.	We can	redeploy	our	stack	from	its	source	definition,	roll	back	the service	configuration	changes	with	the	docker	service rollback	subcommand,	or	“roll	forward”	and	set	the service	scale	directly	to	something	that	will	work.	Try	rolling back:  $	docker	service	rollback	multi-tier-app_api multi-tier-app_api   multi-tier-app_api rollback:	manually	requested	rollback overall	progress:	rolling	back	update:	9	out	of	9	tasks ...	snip	... verify:	Service	converged  The	service	rollback	subcommand	shifts	a	service’s desired	configuration	back	by	one	version.	The	previous configuration	of	multi-tier-app_api	had	nine	replicas. You	can	confirm	that	this	configuration	has	taken	effect	by running	docker	service	ls.	The	output	should	show that	the	multi-tier-app_api	service	has	the	pre- exhaustion	number	of	replicas	running;	for	example,	9 9.	You might	wonder	what	will	happen	if	you	run	rollback	again. If	you	execute	another	rollback,	Docker	will	restore	the config	with	10	service	replicas,	exhausting	resources	again. That	is,	Docker	will	roll	back	the	rollback,	leaving	us	where we	started.	Since	we’d	like	to	undo	multiple	changes,	we’ll need	another	method.  The	cleanest	approach	in	our	case	is	to	redeploy	the	service from	its	source	definition:  docker	stack	deploy	--compose-file	docker-compose.yml	multi- tier-app  Take	a	look	at	the	service’s	tasks	with	docker	service ps	to	ensure	that	the	service	has	returned	to	the	state	declared in	the	Docker	Compose	application	definition:  docker	service	ps	multi-tier-app_api	\ 				--filter	'desired-state=running'	\ 				--format	'table	{{.ID}}	{{.Name}}	{{.Node}} {{.CurrentState}}' ID											NAME																	NODE					CURRENT	STATE h0to0a2lbm87	multi-tier-app_api.1	worker1		Running	about	a   h0to0a2lbm87	multi-tier-app_api.1	worker1		Running	about	a minute	ago v6sq9m14q3tw	multi-tier-app_api.2	manager2	Running	about	a minute	ago  The	manual	scaling	changes	are	gone.	There	are	two	api tasks,	as	expected.  Notice	that	one	task	is	running	on	the	worker1	node	and	the other	is	running	on	manager2	nodes.	This	isn’t	really	the task	placement	we’d	like	for	most	deployments.	Usually,	we’d like	to	implement	architectural	goals	like	these:  Reserve	manager	nodes	for	running	the	Swarm	control	plane	so	they	have dedicated	compute	resources  Isolate	services	that	publish	ports	because	they	are	easier	to	attack	than private	services  We’ll	accomplish	these	goals	and	more	using	Swarm’s	built-in features	for	constraining	where	tasks	run	in	the	next	section.  13.4.2.	Constraining	where	tasks	run  We	often	want	to	control	which	nodes	in	a	cluster	that	an application	runs	on.	We	might	want	to	do	this	in	order	to isolate	workloads	into	different	environments	or	security zones,	take	advantage	of	special	machine	capabilities	such	as GPUs,	or	reserve	a	set	of	nodes	for	a	critical	function.  Docker	services	provide	a	feature	called	placement	constraints that	allow	you	to	control	the	nodes	a	service’s	tasks	can	be assigned	to.	With	placement	constraints,	you	can	say	where service	tasks	should	or	should	not	run.	The	constraints	can	use both	built-in	and	user-defined	properties	of	your	cluster	nodes.   We’ll	work	through	examples	of	each.  In	the	previous	section,	we	saw	that	the	api	service	was distributed	to	all	nodes	when	scaled	up.	The	api	service	ran on	manager	nodes	as	well	on	the	same	node	as	the	postgres database,	as	shown	in	figure	13.11.  Figure	13.11.	API	service	tasks	are	everywhere  Many	system	architects	would	adjust	this	deployment architecture	so	that	manager	nodes	are	dedicated	to	the running	Swarm	cluster.	This	is	a	good	idea	for	important clusters	because	if	a	service	consumes	resources	such	as	CPU, Swarm	might	fall	behind	in	supervising	tasks	and	responding to	operational	commands	that	would	affect	the	operation	of	all services	on	the	cluster.	Also,	because	Swarm	managers	control the	cluster,	access	to	those	nodes	 and	the	Docker	Engine	API  should	be	controlled	tightly.	We	can	use	Swarm’s	node availability	and	service	placement	constraints	to	do	this.  Let’s	start	by	ensuring	that	our	services	do	not	run	on	manager   nodes.	All	nodes	in	a	Swarm	cluster	are	available	to	run service	tasks	by	default.	However,	we	can	reconfigure	the availability	of	nodes	by	using	the	docker	node	update command’s	--availability	option.	There	are	three availability	options:	active,	pause,	and	drain.	The active	option	means	the	schedule	can	assign	new	tasks	to the	node.	The	pause	option	means	existing	tasks	will continue	to	run,	but	no	new	tasks	will	be	scheduled	to	the node.	The	drain	option	means	existing	tasks	will	be	shut down	and	restarted	on	another	node,	and	no	new	tasks	will	be scheduled	to	that	node.  So	we	can	set	the	availability	of	the	manager	nodes	to	drain to	keep	service	tasks	from	running	on	them:  docker	node	update	--availability	drain	manager1 docker	node	update	--availability	drain	manager2 docker	node	update	--availability	drain	manager3  Once	you	run	those	commands,	the	output	of	docker	node ls	should	reflect	the	changes	in	availability:  docker	node	ls	--format	'table	{{	.ID	}}	{{	.Hostname	}}	{{ .Availability	}}' ID																								HOSTNAME	AVAILABILITY ucetqsmbh23vuk6mwy9itv3xo	manager1	Drain b0jajao5mkzdd3ie91q1tewvj	manager2	Drain kxfab99xvgv71tm39zbeveglj	manager3	Drain rbw0c466qqi0d7k4niw01o3nc	worker1		Active u2382qjg6v9vr8z5lfwqrg5hf	worker2		Active  We	can	verify	that	Swarm	has	migrated	the	multi-tier- app	service	tasks	to	the	worker	nodes:  docker	service	ps	multi-tier-app_api	multi-tier-app_postgres	\   docker	service	ps	multi-tier-app_api	multi-tier-app_postgres	\ 				--filter	'desired-state=running'	\ 				--format	'table	{{	.Name	}}	{{	.Node	}}' NAME																						NODE multi-tier-app_postgres.1	worker2 multi-tier-app_api.1						worker1 multi-tier-app_api.2						worker2  If	you	run	docker	container	ps	on	the	manager	nodes, you	should	not	see	any	containers	related	to	service	tasks, either.  Placement	constraints	work	by	expressing	that	a	service	either should	or	should	not	run	on	a	node	based	on	certain	metadata. The	general	form	of	a	constraint	is	as	follows:   	equals	or	does	not	equal	   When	a	service	is	constrained	to	running	in	a	node,	we	say	it has	affinity	for	that	node.	When	it	must	not	run	on	a	node,	we say	it	has	anti-affinity	for	that	node.	You	will	see	these	terms used	throughout	this	and	other	discussions	of	service placement.	Swarm’s	constraint	language	denotes	equality	 a match 	with	==,	and	inequality	with	!=.	When	a	service defines	multiple	constraints,	a	node	must	satisfy	all	constraints for	the	task	to	be	scheduled	there.	That	is,	multiple	constraints are	AND’d	together.	For	example,	suppose	you	want	to	run	a service	on	swarm	worker	nodes	that	are	not	in	the	public security	zone.	Once	you	have	configured	the	cluster’s	zone metadata,	you	could	achieve	this	by	running	the	service	with these	constraints:	node.role	==	worker	and	node .labels.zone	!=	public.  Docker	supports	several	node	attributes	that	can	be	used	as	the   basis	of	constraints:  node.id—	The	unique	identifier	for	the	node	in	the	Swarm	cluster	 for example,	ucetqsmbh23vuk6mwy9itv3xo   node.hostname—	The	node’s	hostname,	 for	example,	worker2   node.role—	The	node’s	role	in	the	cluster,	either	manager	or worker  node.labels. —	A	label	applied	to	the	node	by	an operator	 for	example,	a	node	with	a	zone=public	label	would	have	a node	attribute	of	node.labels.zone=public   engine.labels—	A	set	of	labels	describing	key	properties	of	the	node and	Docker	Engine	such	as	Docker	version	and	operating	system	 for example,	engine.labels.operatingsystem==ubuntu 16.04   Let’s	continue	organizing	our	system	by	separating	the	worker nodes	of	our	cluster	into	a	public	and	a	private	zone. Once	we	have	these	zones,	we	will	update	the	api	and postgres	services	so	their	tasks	run	only	in	the	desired zone.  You	can	label	Swarm	cluster	nodes	with	your	own	metadata by	using	the	docker	node	update	command’s	-- label-add	option.	This	option	accepts	a	list	of	key value pairs	that	will	be	added	to	the	node’s	metadata.	There	is	also	a --label-rm	option	to	remove	metadata	from	a	node.	This metadata	will	be	available	for	use	in	constraining	tasks	to particular	nodes.  Let’s	identify	worker1	as	part	of	the	private	zone,	and worker2	as	part	of	the	public	zone:  $	docker	node	update	--label-add	zone=private	worker1   worker1 $	docker	node	update	--label-add	zone=public	worker2 worker2  Now	constrain	the	api	service	to	the	public	zone.	The docker	service	create	and	update	commands	have options	to	add	and	remove	task-scheduling	constraints,	-- constraint-add	and	--constraint-rm,	respectively. The	constraint	we	added	to	the	service	tells	Swarm	to	schedule only	api	service	tasks	on	nodes	with	a	zone	label	that	equals public:  docker	service	update	\ 				--constraint-add	'node.labels.zone	==	public'	\ 				multi-tier-app_api  If	all	goes	well,	Docker	will	report	that	the	api	service’s	tasks have	converged	to	the	new	state:  multi-tier-app_api overall	progress:	2	out	of	2	tasks 1 2:	running [==================================================>] 2 2:	running [==================================================>] verify:	Service	converged  You	can	verify	that	the	api	tasks	have	been	rescheduled	to the	worker2	node:  docker	service	ps	multi-tier-app_api	\ 				--filter	'desired-state=running'	\ 				--format	'table	{{	.Name	}}	{{	.Node	}}' NAME	NODE multi-tier-app_api.1	worker2 multi-tier-app_api.2	worker2   Unfortunately,	we	can’t	display	node	label	information	in docker	service	ps	output	nor	see	the	labels	we’ve added	with	docker	node	ls.	Currently,	the	only	way	to see	a	node’s	labels	is	to	inspect	the	node.	Here’s	a	quick	bash shell	script	to	show	the	hostname,	role,	and	label	information for	all	nodes	in	a	cluster:  for	node_id	in	`docker	node	ls	-q		head`;	do 		docker	node	inspect	\ 		--format	'{{.Description.Hostname}}	{{.Spec.Role}} {{.Spec.Labels}}'\ 		"${node_id}"; done;  This	script	should	output	the	following:  manager1	manager	map[] manager2	manager	map[] manager3	manager	map[] worker1	worker	map[zone:private] worker2	worker	map[zone:public]  This	isn’t	great,	but	it’s	better	than	trying	to	recall	which nodes	have	which	labels.  The	final	adjustment	we	need	to	make	to	this	system	is	to relocate	the	postgres	database	to	the	private	zone. Before	doing	that,	issue	some	queries	to	the	api	service’s  counter	endpoint	with	curl:  curl	http:  127.0.0.1:8080 counter  The	 counter	endpoint	inserts	a	record	into	a	table	with	an auto-incrementing	id	column.	When	the	api	service   responds,	it	prints	out	all	of	the	IDs	in	the	column.	If	you	issue three	requests	to	the	endpoint,	the	output	of	the	third	response should	be	similar	to	the	following:  	curl	http:  127.0.0.1:8080 counter SERVER:	c098f30dd3c4 DB_ADDR:	postgres DB_PORT:	5432 ID:	1 ID:	2 ID:	3  This	may	seem	like	a	bit	of	a	diversion,	but	inserting	these records	will	help	demonstrate	a	key	point	in	a	moment.  Let’s	constrain	the	postgres	task	to	the	private	zone:  $	docker	service	update	--constraint-add	'node.labels.zone	== private'	\ 				multi-tier-app_postgres multi-tier-app_postgres overall	progress:	1	out	of	1	tasks 1 1:	running [==================================================>] verify:	Service	converged  The	postgres	task	is	now	running	on	the	worker1	node:  $	docker	service	ps	multi-tier-app_postgres	\ 				--filter	'desired-state=running'	\ 				--format	'table	{{	.Name	}}	{{	.Node	}}' NAME																						NODE multi-tier-app_postgres.1	worker1  Now,	if	you	issue	a	request	to	the	 counter	endpoint,	you will	see	this:  $	curl	http:  127.0.0.1:8080 counter SERVER:	c098f30dd3c4   SERVER:	c098f30dd3c4 DB_ADDR:	postgres DB_PORT:	5432 ID:	1  The	counter	has	been	reset.	Where	did	our	data	go?	It	was	lost because	the	postgres	database	used	a	db-data	volume that	is	local	to	a	cluster	node.	Strictly	speaking,	the	data	wasn’t lost.	If	the	postgres	task	migrates	back	to	the	worker2 node,	it	will	mount	the	original	volume	and	resume	counting from	3.	If	you	were	following	along	on	your	own	cluster	and didn’t	notice	data	loss,	it’s	probably	because	postgres happened	to	deploy	to	worker1	to	start	with.	This	lack	of determinism	and	potential	for	data	loss	is	not	a	good	situation. What	can	we	do	about	it?  The	default	Docker	volume	storage	driver	uses	the	node’s storage.	This	storage	driver	does	not	share	or	back	up	data across	the	Swarm	cluster.	There	are	Docker	storage	drivers that	add	features	like	this,	including	Docker	CloudStor	and Rex-Ray.	Those	drivers	will	enable	you	to	create	and	share	a volume	across	the	cluster.	You	should	investigate	and	test these	drivers	carefully	before	committing	important	data	to them.  Another	approach	to	ensure	that	a	task	runs	consistently	on	a given	node	is	to	constrain	it	to	a	specific	node.	Relevant constraint	options	are	node	hostname,	node	ID,	or	a	user- defined	label.	For	now,	let’s	constrain	the	postgres	task	to the	worker1	node	to	ensure	that	it	doesn’t	move	from	that node,	even	if	the	private	zone	expands:  docker	service	update	--constraint-add	'node.hostname	== worker1'	\   worker1'	\ 				multi-tier-app_postgres  Now,	the	postgres	service	will	not	move	from	that	node. Inspection	of	the	service’s	placement	constraints	shows	that two	are	active:  $	docker	service	inspect	\ 				--format	'{{json	.Spec.TaskTemplate.Placement.Constraints }}'	\ 				multi-tier-app_postgres ["node.hostname	==	worker1","node.labels.zone	==	private"]  If	we	wanted	to	continue	with	these	placement	constraints,	we would	specify	these	in	the	example	application’s	docker- compose.yml.	Here	is	how	to	express	the	postgres service’s	constraints:  services: 		postgres: 					...	snip	... 				deploy: 							...	snip	... 								placement: 										constraints: 												-	node.labels.zone	==	private 												-	node.hostname	==	worker1  Now	the	placement	constraints	won’t	be	lost	the	next	time	we deploy	the	application	by	using	docker	stack	deploy.  Note  You	will	need	to	perform	a	lot	of	careful	engineering	in	order to	safely	run	databases	with	important	data	on	container clusters	such	as	Swarm.	The	exact	strategy	will	likely	be   specific	to	the	database	implementation	so	that	you	can	take advantage	of	the	database’s	specific	replication,	backup,	and data	recovery	strengths.  Now	that	we	have	explored	how	to	constrain	services	to particular	nodes,	let’s	go	in	the	complete	opposite	direction and	deploy	a	service	everywhere	with	global	services.  13.4.3.	Using	global	services	for	one	task	per	node  You	can	deploy	one	service	task	to	each	node	in	the	Swarm cluster	by	declaring	the	service’s	mode	to	be	global.	This	is useful	when	you	want	to	scale	a	service	along	with	the	size	of the	cluster.	Common	use	cases	include	logging	and	monitoring services.  Let’s	deploy	a	second	instance	of	our	echo	service	as	a global	service:  docker	service	create	--name	echo-global	\ 		--mode	global	\																												1 		--publish	'9000:8'	\																							2 		busybox:1.29	nc	-v	-lk	-p	8	-e	 bin cat  1	Uses	“global”	instead	of	“replicated”  2	Publishes	port	9000	to	avoid	collision	with	echo	service  If	you	run	docker	service	ls,	you	will	see	that	the echo-global	service	is	operating	in	global	mode.	The mode	of	the	other	services	we	have	deployed	so	far	will	be replicated,	the	default.   You	can	verify	that	Swarm	has	deployed	one	task	on	each node	that	is	available	for	task	scheduling.	This	example	uses the	previous	section’s	Swarm	cluster,	in	which	only	the worker	nodes	are	available	for	tasks.	The	docker	service ps	command	confirms	there	is	one	task	on	each	of	those nodes:  docker	service	ps	echo-global	\ 				--filter	'desired-state=running'	\ 				--format	'table	{{	.Name	}}	{{	.Node	}}' NAME																																		NODE echo-global.u2382qjg6v9vr8z5lfwqrg5hf	worker2 echo-global.rbw0c466qqi0d7k4niw01o3nc	worker1  You	can	interact	with	echo-global	service	just	as	you	did the	echo	service.	Send	a	few	messages	by	using	the	following command:  [worker1]	$		echo	'hello'			nc	127.0.0.1	-w	3	9000					1  1	Sends	to	echo-global	service	using	published	port  Remember	that	client	connections	will	be	routed	through	the service’s	virtual	IP	 see	section	13.3.5 .	Because	of	Docker networking’s	routing	behavior,	a	client	of	a	global	service	may connect	to	a	task	on	another	node	instead	of	its	own.	The probability	of	connecting	to	a	global	service	task	on	another node	goes	up	with	size	of	the	cluster	because	connections	are balanced	uniformly.	You	can	see	the	connection-based	load balancing	happening	if	you	inspect	the	logs	with	docker service	logs	--follow	--timestamps	echo- global	and	send	messages	to	the	service.   The	following	output	was	produced	by	connecting	to worker1	and	sending	messages	1	second	apart:  2019-02-23T23:51:01.042747381Z	 echo-global.0.rx3o7rgl6gm9@worker2				 connect	to	[::ffff:10.255.0.95]:8	from	 [::ffff:10.255.0.3]:40170  [::ffff:10.255.0.3]:40170  2019-02-23T23:51:02.134314055Z	 echo-global.0.hp01yak2txv2@worker1				  connect	to	[::ffff:10.255.0.94]:8	from	 [::ffff:10.255.0.3]:40172  [::ffff:10.255.0.3]:40172  2019-02-23T23:51:03.264498966Z	 echo-global.0.rx3o7rgl6gm9@worker2				 connect	to	[::ffff:10.255.0.95]:8	from	 [::ffff:10.255.0.3]:40174  [::ffff:10.255.0.3]:40174  2019-02-23T23:51:04.398477263Z	 echo-global.0.hp01yak2txv2@worker1				 connect	to	[::ffff:10.255.0.94]:8	from	 [::ffff:10.255.0.3]:40176  [::ffff:10.255.0.3]:40176  2019-02-23T23:51:05.412948512Z	 echo-global.0.rx3o7rgl6gm9@worker2				 connect	to	[::ffff:10.255.0.95]:8	from	 [::ffff:10.255.0.3]:40178  [::ffff:10.255.0.3]:40178   The	nc	client	program	sending	messages	was	running	on worker1.	This	log	output	shows	that	the	client’s	connections that	were	routed	bounce	between	the	task	on	worker2,	with IP	ending	in	.95,	and	the	task	on	worker1,	with	IP	ending in	.94.  13.4.4.	Deploying	real	applications	onto	real	clusters  The	preceding	exercises	have	shown	how	Swarm	tries	to converge	an	application’s	actual	deployed	resources	to	the desired	state	indicated	in	the	application’s	deployment   descriptor.  The	desired	state	of	the	cluster	changes	as	applications	are updated,	cluster	resources	such	as	nodes	and	shared	networks are	added	or	removed,	or	new	configurations	and	secrets	are provided	by	operators.	Swarm	processes	these	events	and updates	state	in	the	internal	log	replicated	among	the	cluster’s manager	nodes.	When	Swarm	sees	an	event	that	changes	the desired	state,	the	leader	of	the	managers	issues	commands	to the	rest	of	the	cluster	to	converge	to	the	desired	state.	Swarm will	converge	to	the	desired	state	by	starting	or	updating service	tasks,	overlay	networks,	and	other	resources	within	the constraints	specified	by	operators.  You	may	be	wondering	which	features	of	Swarm	to	start	with. First,	make	an	inventory	of	the	kinds	of	applications	you	want to	run	and	the	types	of	Swarm	resources	they	will	need. Second,	think	about	how	you	want	to	organize	those applications	running	on	the	cluster.	Third,	decide	whether	the cluster	will	support	stateful	services	such	as	databases	and determine	a	strategy	for	managing	data	safely.  Remember,	you	can	start	by	deploying	stateless	services	that use	only	the	networking,	configuration,	and	secret management	features	of	Swarm.	This	approach	provides	the opportunity	to	learn	more	about	Swarm	and	the	way	services operate	in	a	multihost	environment	without	putting	data	at risk.  With	thoughtful	design	and	proactive	monitoring	of	the cluster’s	resources,	you	can	ensure	that	applications	have	the   resources	they	need,	when	they	need	it.	You	can	also	set expectations	for	which	activities	and	data	the	cluster	should host.   SUMMARY  This	chapter	explored	many	aspects	of	running	Docker services	on	a	cluster	of	hosts	managed	by	Swarm.	The exercises	demonstrated	how	to	deploy	several	kinds	of applications	using	Swarm’s	most	important	and	commonly used	features.	We	saw	what	happens	when	a	cluster	runs	out of	resources	and	showed	how	to	recover	from	that	condition. We	also	reconfigured	a	cluster	and	service	deployment	to implement	user-defined	architectural	goals.	The	key	points	to understand	from	this	chapter	are:  Administrators	define	cluster-scoped	resources	such	as	networks, configurations,	and	secrets	that	are	shared	by	services.  Services	define	their	own	service-scoped	resources	in	addition	to	using cluster-scoped	resources.  Swarm	managers	store	and	manage	updates	to	the	desired	state	of	the cluster.  Swarm	managers	converge	actual	application	and	resource	deployments	to the	desired	state	when	sufficient	resources	are	available.  Service	tasks	are	ephemeral,	and	service	updates	cause	tasks	to	be replaced	with	new	containers.  Service	tasks	can	be	scaled	to	the	desired	state	as	long	as	the	cluster	has enough	resources	available	on	nodes	that	fulfill	the	service’s	placement constraints.

Docker in Action, Second Edition teaches you to create, deploy, and manage applications hosted in Docker containers running on Linux. Fully updated, with four new chapters and revised best practices and examples, this second edition begins with a clear explanation of the Docker model. Then, you go hands-on with packaging applications, testing, installing, running programs securely, and deploying them across a cluster of hosts. With examples showing how Docker benefits the whole dev lifecycle, you'll discover techniques for everything from dev-and-test machines to full-scale cloud deployments.
