Table of Contents  Introduction Chapter 1: What You Need to Know Chapter 2: White Hat Hacking Chapter 3: Speak the Language Chapter 4: Differences in Hacking   Chapter 5: Starting to Hack Chapter 6: Making Hacking Yours Conclusion     Introduction     this  Congratulations  on  downloading  book and thank you for doing so. The  following  chapters  will  explain  to you  how  you  can  go  from  knowing nothing  about  hacking  to  learning  the basics that you will need to know to get started. There are plenty of books on this subject on the market, thanks again for choosing this  one!  Every  effort  was  made  to   ensure  it  is  full  of  as  much  useful information as possible, please enjoy!     Chapter 1: What You  Need to Know    If  you  have  never  done  any  work  with hacking  in  the  past,  or  you  have  no experience with it, there are a few things that you will need to know to make sure that  you  are  doing  things  the  right  way and that you are able to get them done so that  you  can  get  the  most  out  of  the hacking  experience.  There  is  a  lot  of information  that  you  will  need  to  learn   before you are even able to start learning about the different languages and scripts that you can use, but learning this will go quickly. The most important thing to learn is that there  are  different  types  of  hackers. There are ones who are able to do things for  good,  for  bad,  and  for  reasons  that nobody  but  them  knows  about.  Learn  a little about each of the types of hackers so  that  you  will  know  which  type  you want to be  and which you don’t want to be .   Black Hat These  are  the  hackers  that  you  are probably  used  to  hearing  about  in  the news  and  in  movies.  They  are  the  ones who break into systems, ruin computers, and  steal  your  information.  Despite  the fact  that  these  are  the  most  “popular” type  of  hackers,  they  represent  only  a small  percentage  of  the  entire  hacking population,  and  they  are  generally something  that  you  may  not  even  come into  contact  with  on  a  regular  basis while you are hacking. It is a good idea   to make sure that you know  about  these types, though, because they are really the biggest problem that you will eventually have to look out for. Many people do not aspire to be a black hat  hacker.  They  only  want  to  be  a hacker, but they end up caught in this trap because  it  is  something  that  they  think that they are doing for the right reasons or they think that it will not cause much harm.  Some  hackers  may  not  have  a choice  and  may  be  forced  to  use  black hat  tactics  because  of  a  perilous financial  situation  or  because  they  are   being directed to by the person who has shown them how to hack. No matter how they  got  there,  most  of  the  black  hat hackers did not start out by intentionally wanting to be a “bad” hacker. White Hat If  you  have  ever  used  someone  to  help you  get  a  virus  off  of  your  computer, someone  who  can  control  the  computer from a remote location, or someone who can  help  you  protect  against  the  “bad” hackers,  you  have  already  had  contact with  a  white  hat  hacker.  Many  people   choose to be hackers because they want to help people and they know that being a white hat is the way to do it. They set out  to  go  against  all  of  the  black  hat hackers, and they work to make sure that the people who they serve are able to get the help that they need when it comes to different hacking situations. It is important to note that the majority of people who are white hat hackers do not work  on  their  own.  They  work  for companies or corporations who are able to use their services to protect their own assets, to market their services to people   who  come  to  them,  and  to  allow  the chance to make sure that they are getting the best protection possible. There  are  some  white  hat  hackers  who work  on  their  own,  but  it  is  more difficult  for  them  to  find  work  because so few people know about them or what they are able to do to make things better. Script Kiddie A Script Kiddie is anyone who steals the codes that others have written and uses them for some type of black hat hacking. Some hackers who do start out with the   intention  of  being  bad  or  doing  things that  are  illegal  will  start  out  as  Script Kiddies. They often do not even stay in the  business  of  hacking  for  very  long because  they  only  want  to  use  other people’s work. They have no aspiration to make up their own codes or their own information,  and  that  can  be  a  problem because  there  is  only  so  much  copying that they can do until they have run out of codes to use. The Script Kiddies are among the most disliked in the hacking community. White hat  hackers  dislike  them,  black  hat   hackers  dislike  them  also.  Even  the N00bz,  if  they  knew  what  they  were, would  dislike  the  Script  Kiddies.  They take away from the good work that all of the white hats are trying to do while also stealing the work that the black hats have done  with  the  malicious  scripts  they have written. Whether you are trying to learn hacking or not, try your hardest not to be a Script Kiddie. N00b Everyone  who  is  in  hacking  started  out as a noob. Whether you are planning on   being a good hacker or a bad hacker, you will be a noob until you learn the ropes. If  you  have  a  good  teacher  who  can show  you  everything  that  you  need  to know about hacking, you will not be an n00b  for  too  long  but,  no  matter  what, you  should  make  sure  that  you  are working  to  learn  everything  that  you need to know as quickly as you possibly can. For the most part, the community is nice to  n00bz.  As  long  as  you  are  learning and you do not get too overly confident with  yourself  or  become  narcissistic   about  your  hacking  skills,  most  people will  be  willing  to  help  you.  The community is always open to helping out others  who  are  hacking  for  the  right reason,  who  want  to  make  a  difference in the world and who want to become a part of something that is so much bigger than what others have done up until that point. Most  people  who  read  the  descriptions usually  have  a  good  idea  of  what  they want  to  be  and  the  type  of  hacker  they are going to start out as. This is because many  people  want  to  be  white  hat   hackers  and,  surprisingly,  most  do  not have much interest in learning how to do bad  things  when  it  comes  to  hacking. Make  sure  that  you  are  doing  the  right thing with hacking and that you are able to get the most out of it by deciding first what you want to be, how you want to do it, and who you want to be able to help. After  you  have  decided  what  type  of hacker  you  are  going  to  be,  you  should learn  some  of  the  few  key  terms  to hacking. All  of  these  terms  are  things  you  will come across while you are hacking and   that  you  save   you  should  make  sure  that  you  know them.  It  is  a  good  idea  to  print  off  the glossary and keep track of it so that you know  what  information  you  are  looking at. If you do not want a hard copy of it, just  make  sure  it somewhere  you  will  know  about  later on.   Spam – This is used by black hat hackers to get information  from  people  or  to  cause them to get a virus on their computer. It   is  used  on  social  media,  emails  and other  types  of  messages.  If  someone clicks  on  the  spam  or  puts  any  of  their information in, they will have given their information  to  a  black  hatter  or  will have a virus installed on their computer. Spam  has  been  around  for  as  long  as hacking has been. Remote Access – This  is  controlling  a  computer   or anything  else   from  a  different  location that  is  …  remote!  There  are  many reasons  for  this,  both  good  and  bad.   to   to  bring  harm   Black hat hackers use this to be able to take  over  a  person’s  computer  for  bad reasons  and  the computer. White hat hackers are able to use  this  to  help  a  person  fix  their computer or get rid of any malware that may have come from black hat hackers. Hacking – Taking  away  from  the  way  that  the computer  to  operate. Changing  it  by  using  codes  and  other information  that  will  allow  you  the chance to make things look different on  supposed   is    is,   essentially,  manipulating   your  computer.  It  can  be  used  for  both good  and  bad,  but  is  most  commonly used for good. It  a computer to do exactly what you want it to do. Firewall – Many computers have these in place, and they are supposed to help keep a hacker from  getting  through  the  computer  and able  to  hack  into  it.  The  problem  with the  majority  of  firewalls  is  that  they provide  a  false  sense  of  security.   Beyond  n00bz  and  Script  Kiddies, nearly  every  hacker  is  able  to  get  past most firewalls. These are mostly useless unless  the  program  that  is  trying  to  get into  the  computer  is  an  actual  program instead of just a hacker who wants in. Doxing – This  happens  when  someone  becomes exposed  online  and  is  something  that will allow you the chance to see that you are dealing with a bad person. Doxing is usually  something  that  black  hat  hacker use but it can also be used for others on   someone  who  is  doing  something  bad. Doxing  usually  occurs  in  online communities  where  there  is  anonymity. The hacker will get the information, like the IP address, personal name, and other identifying  information,  and  expose  the person in an online scenario. This can be physically dangerous to the person who is being doxed. Trojans – Think  of  the  Trojan  horse.  This  is  one big file that has many small files inside that  can  be  malicious.  The  big  file  is   often  downloaded  because  the  person who does it thinks that it is harmless. It usually  has  a  different  name  and  is something that seems innocent. Spyware – If  you  want  to  see  what  someone  is doing on their computer all the time, you will  need  spyware.  The  most  common use  of  spyware  is  to  help  people  get their  computer  running it  can  also  be  used correctly,  but  maliciously  for  people  who  want  to learn  about  the  different  things  that  are  fixed  and    on a person’s computer. It can be really detrimental  if  you  have  unwanted spyware on your computer. Code – This is the information that will dictate what you write about and the information that  you  include  in  different  things.  It translates  from  different  symbols  and letters  to  actual,  readable  text  that  will show people what you are talking about. Codes  are  used  by  hackers,  as  well  as script writers. Bots –   Computer  generated  hacker.  Hackers may  make  bots  to  help  them  do  tasks. The biggest benefit of a bot is that it is automated  and  you  do  not  need  a computer operator to be able to use the bot. They are great for people who want to  be  able  to  automate  processes. Cortana,  Siri,  and  Alexa  are  just  a  few of the most famous bots. Malware – Anything that is put on a computer that is meant  to  bring  harm  to  the  computer  or the person using it is malware. This is a   term  that  is  used  for  everything  from traditional  viruses  to  Trojans  and everything in between. If the program is put on the computer to bring harm, then it is malware. Keystrokes – When you type, this is a keystroke. Each time that you write a “letter,” there is a keystroke  that  responds  to  it.  There  are many  reasons  for  keeping  track  of keystrokes, but the majority of black hat hackers  do  this  so  that  they  are  able  to get passwords or private information.   Hacktivist – Anyone who is hacking for a cause is a hacktivist.  This  is  something  that  will make people have a different opinion of the hacker and will change the way that the  hacker  is  able  to  react  to  different things.  There  are  many  options  for hackers who want to hack with a cause, but  the  majority  of  people  do  it  for social or political purposes. Many do it to  help  take  down  corruption  and problems  that  come  along  with  the government  social  other   or    establishments. No matter what you learn about hacking, keeping  these  key  terms  in  mind  will help  you  become  a  better  hacker  and avoid different things. If you are a white hat hacker, you will need to learn these terms because they will likely be things that  you  are  trying  to  fix  for  people  or trying  to  get  rid  of  before  they  have  a chance to make a negative impact.   Chapter 2: White Hat  Hacking    Even with the basic knowledge that you have  learned  about  hacking,  in  addition to  information  that  you  may  already know,  there  are  some  things  that  will make a difference for you when it comes to hacking for good reasons. You should make  sure  that  you  are  aware  of  what you  can  do  to  make  sure  that  you  are getting  what  you  need  out  of  hacking.   There  are  many  problems  that  you  may come across, but remember all of these things  will  help  you  to  remember  your initial goal — to be a white hat hacker. As  you  go  through  this  chapter,  try  to find  something  that  you  did  not  already know. The chances are that there is quite a bit that you didn’t know and you will be  able  to  use  this  information  to  help yourself  out.  There  lot  more information  in  each  of  the  following chapters,  but  this  information  focuses mostly on white hat hacking and how you can do it.  is  a    It Looks Average Whether you are a white hat hacker or a black  hat  hacker,  you  really  don’t  need to  worry  about  those  malicious  looking black screens with bright green writing. They  are  rarely  used  when  it  comes  to hacking, and they are actually pretty bad for  your  eyesight,  so  don’t  even  think about  that  when  you  are  considering becoming a hacker. The chances are that you will be looking at  something  that  looks  very  similar  to your  desktop  on  a  daily  basis.  This  is   things  around  on   because  hacking  usually  involves  files and  moving  the computer  instead  of  trying  to  put  the code into word processing systems. This is,  perhaps,  one  of  the  biggest misconceptions  that  people  have  about hacking.  The  way  is perceived  in  movies  is  much  different from  what  it  really  is  in  real  life,  and you are more likely to see bright colors and  your  favorite  desktop  background than you are to see an old computer with lines of confusing codes. Ethical Hacking  that  hacking    There are many different types of ethical hacking,  and  they  can  mean  something different to each person who is a hacker. This  is  because  there  is  no  exact  black and  white  when  it  comes  to  hacking. Yes, it is wrong to hack into someone’s bank account and get their information to remove the money. But, is it so wrong if that  person  had  originally  stolen thousands of dollars from other people? To be able to be a successful white hat hacker,  you  need  to  make  sure  that  you have  a  strong  moral  code  and  that  you know what you are comfortable with. It   is  all  about  making  sure  that  you  are within  your  own  comfort  zone  and  you are getting what you need out of hacking each  time  that  you  do  it.  If  not,  the hacking  will  not  be  worth  it,  and  you may  have  to  worry  about  the  problems that  ethical inconsistencies. Try Not to Bring Bad Most ethical hackers work with the idea that they will do everything that they can to keep people out of harm’s way. This means  that  they  do  not  bring  malicious  along  with   come    software into computers no matter what the reason would be for. They also try to keep privacy in mind most of the time. If they  can  avoid  it  at  all,  they  will  do everything  that  they  can  to  not  put spyware  or  anything  else  on  the computer that could be detrimental. By trying your best to bring no harm to people  who  you  work  with  or  for,  you will be able to make sure that you are as ethical  as  possible  about  your  hacking. This is the most common area that white hat hackers go bad in. They do not know when  to  stop,  and  they  begin  to  bring   harm to other people with their hacking skills. Test it Out Whether  you  are  making  a  code  for yourself,  for  someone  else  or  for  a company  that  you  may  work  for,  you need  to  always  make  sure  that  you  are testing it out before you put it into action. There are ways that you can do this and programs that you can download, but no matter how you do it, it needs to be done the right way. If you are making sure that you do it the   right  way,  you  will  allow  yourself  the chance to always have the right hacking and the right codes that come along with it.  This  is  something  that  can  be  done easily, and it is just an important step. If you do not test the hack that you have created,  you  could  risk  damaging  your own computer or, even worse, someone else’s computer. Learn What You Need Before  you  even  get  started  with hacking,  you  need  to  learn  as  much  as you  possibly  can  about  the  different   things that you will need to do to be able to  hack  correctly.  Learn  some  of  the codes  that  you  are  going  to  use,  try  the basics  out  and  move  on  to  new  things. Keep  a  log  of  everything  that  you  are going  to  use  while  you  are  hacking  so that you will be able to do more with it later on. There are many great things that come  along  with  hacking  so  keeping track of the different codes that you can use  will  allow  you  the  chance  to  make sure that you are getting the most out of it. If  you  learn  what  you  need  before  you   start  actually  hacking,  you  will  be  one step ahead of the other n00bz who may not  know  what  they  are  doing,  and  you will  be  able  to  make  sure  that  you  can truly do your best with hacking when you start out. Software Downloads There  are  some  software  programs  that you  will  need  to  be  able  to  effectively hack  later  on.  Make  sure  that  you  are aware  of  these  programs  and  that  you have them on your computer so that you will be able to get the most out of them. Doing this will allow you the chance to   have the best start possible. It will also give  you  one  less  thing  that  you  will need to worry about with hacking when you first start out. things  and  different Try  different  programs. Depending on what you want to  do  with  hacking,  you  will  need several  different  programs  on  your computer  before  starting  out  with  the different things that you can do with it. Find a Teacher The  easiest  way  to  start  hacking  is  to find  someone  who  will  be  able  to mentor  you  and  help  you  out  with  the   different  things  that  you  need  when  it comes  to  hacking.  Make  sure  that  the person  who  you  use  to  help  you  is someone  who  knows  what  they  are talking  about.  There  can  be  problems that  come  along  with  hacking,  and  you will need a professional or an expert to be  able  to  help  you  with  all  of  the different problems. Find someone who you trust, who knows what they are doing, and who is going to be  patient  with  you  while  you  are learning  all  about  hacking.  This  is  the easiest way for you to make sure that you   are getting the most out of the experience and  that  you  are  able  to  make  sure  that things will be done the right way when you  begin  to  hack  on  a  professional level. Apply It There are so many different applications of hacking that you can choose to work in  any  sector  that  you  want,  really. Hackers  can  do  anything  from  working for  the government  with  the  skills  that  they develop. This is a great opportunity for people who do not have many skills, and  to  working  for   themselves    hacking is relatively easy to learn if you keep  your  mind  open  to  all  of  the possibilities. Just make sure that you are prepared for what  hacking  will  be  able  to  help  you do,  and  you  make  sure  that  you  are getting the most out of it. While  you  are  trying  different  things with hacking, keep in mind what you are going  to  do  with  it  later  on  down  the road.  There  are  many  different  options that you can choose to do with hacking, and  you  should  make  sure  that  you  are doing  each  of  them.  There  are  other   options  that  you  have  when  it  comes  to your hacking experience. Just make sure that you are learning what you can about hacking and that you are getting the most out of the experience each time you learn something new. Helping Others Many people who choose to hack do so because  they  want  to  be  able  to  help other people. This is something that they want to be able to do and something that they feel passionate about each time that they do it. You  may  choose  to  help  people  in  the   form  of  a  program  like  anonymous  or you  may  want  to  do  other  things  with hacking. Most of the people who work to be able to help people out on a personal level  are  the  hackers  who  work independently on their own to be able to do different things. Working for Business There  are  many  businesses,  especially technology  related  ones,  that  will  hire hackers to be able to help them out with the  different  programs  that  they  have. They  want  to  make  sure  that  they  are able  to  compete  with  the  black  hat   hackers and they do this through the use of white hat hackers. Since there are not many hackers who are available for this kind  of  work,  there  are  nearly  always businesses  that  are  hiring  white  hat hackers. Try to find one that is reputable and  one  that  will  help  you  out  with  the different things that you may need when it  comes  to  hacking  and  the  different options. Designing Programs It  is  not  uncommon  for  hackers  to  be program designers as well. People who have  hacking  skills  are  also  able  to   create software that can be purchased or downloaded  for  free.  The  majority  of people  who  are  able  to  do  different things  with  hacking  do  so  with  the software and the same type of codes that are used with software. There are many different options. Whether  you  want  to  be  able  to  add different  program  options  to  your hacking experience or you want to make sure that you are getting the most from it, you  should  make  sure  that  you  are  able to hack as much as possible and that you can  design  as  many  programs  as  you   want.  Consider  even  creating  software to  help  yourself  get  the  hacking experience that you need. Adding Services Once you have learned how to hack the right  way,  there  are  many  different services that you can add onto, and it is something  that  you  will  need  to  make sure  that  you  learn  about  when  you practice hacking. It is a good idea to try to make sure that you are getting the most out  of  the  hacking  experience  and  that you  are  learning  as  many  services  as   possible  for  the  people  who  you  are helping.  The  more  experience  that  you have  with  helping  people  and  the  more services  you  have  to  offer,  the  more valuable  you  will  be  when  it  comes  to hacking and the different options that you have to offer.   Chapter 3: Speak the  Language    As  with  any  other  type  of  advanced computer  writing  that  you  may  do,  you will need to learn the different languages that are used in hacking. These languages are somewhat difficult to learn when you first  start  out,  but  once  you  know  them, they  are  something  that  you  will  not likely  forget  about  at  any  point  in  your life. As long as you continue to use them   for  hacking,  you  will  be  able  to  make sure that you are getting the most out of them. Learning  the  language  is  all  about  the different aspects of it. There are several different  options  for  hacking,  and  you need  to  figure  out  which  language  is going  to  be  the  best  for  what  you  want and the different thing that you are going to be able to do with hacking. Just make sure that you learn the right one, and you will be on your way to becoming a great hacker.   Languages Even  though  you  will  likely  find  that some  of  the  language  aspects  that  are present  in  hacking  are  similar  to  the other  types  of  writing  and  coding languages,  the  hacking  one  is  much different.  There  are  some  aspects  that are  taken  from  HTML  and  JavaScript, but  they  are  not  the  same.  It  can  be beneficial  to  know  the  other  languages that go along with hacking, but you will not  necessarily  need  the languages to be successful with it. If you know HTML or any other type of coding,  learn   to    that  will  help  you,  but  do  not specifically  learn  them  just  so  you  can hack. You don’t necessarily need them. Once  you  learn  the  languages  that  you need to be able to hack different things, you can do a lot more with them than just the basic hacking that you would like to do. There are many different options for hackers  creating programs for the computer, to designing different options, to helping prevent the black  hat  hackers  from  getting  into  the computer.  As  long  as  you  know  the hacking language, you will be able to do  range   from   that    nearly anything that you want. Programming Learning  hacking  languages  will  allow you  to  become  a  programmer.  You  may not  be  able  to  develop  extremely detailed  video  games  or  anything  like that,  but  you  will  be  able  to  make  sure that you can do things on the Internet and by  using  the  computer.  You  can  even design software. By  programming  different  sites  with your hacking skills, you will allow them to do different things and can make them   more functional for the people who visit the  sites.  This  type  of  programming  is fairly simple to use in that you just need to  have  a  plain  text  generator,  the knowledge of the language and a way to test it out to make sure that it works for your specific programming guide. There are  many  different  options  when  it comes  to  the  creation  of  online  coding, and  you  can  use  each  of  them  for  your own hacking experience. If you want to design programs that can be  used  on  the  computer  or  just  on  the Internet, you can also do that with your   hacking knowledge. While the languages are different, they are similar in that you can  make  any  program  that  you  want. Each  of  the  programs  that  you  use  to make  the  different  codes  will  be different and will be something that you will  need  to  get  used  to  as  you  learn more  the  hacking community. Different There  are  different  hacking  languages that  will  work  differently  depending  on the situation that you are in and the type  about   and   it    of hacking that you want to be able to do. The  hacking  language  that  you  choose will  be  dependent  on  several  different things,  but  the  most  important  will  be which type of hacking you are doing. If you are hacking from a remote location or  from  the  same  location  will  be  the biggest determining factor and will make things  easier  on  you  if  you  choose  the right one. Despite  the  fact  that  there  are  different languages that you can choose from, they are  all  relatively  similar.  They  are  all written  with  the  same  base  factors  in   mind,  and  they  are  able  to  make  things better  for  you,  depending  on  what  you want to be able to do with them. It is a good  idea  to  try  to  make  sure  that  you are  getting  the  most  out  of  each  of  the languages. Some people choose to learn all three of the hacking languages so that they will always be able to use them for their hacking abilities and will not have to learn something new just because they want to try something else out. TCP TCP   for  Transfer   control  stands    both   between   protocol. It is something that will allow you  to  communicate  with  the  different programs that you are using. It is easier to  use  than  any  of  the  other  languages, and  it  gives  you  a  chance  to  make communication  the computer and the other people who are helping you with the hack. It can be used on  nearly  any  operating  system  and  is easy  to  learn.  This  is  the  first  language that  most  people  is something  that  is  similar.  TCP  is  a combination  of  each  of  the  other  two protocols  in  addition  to  some  extra  learn,  and   it    features. One  of  the  best  things  about  learning TCP  first  is  that  each  of  the  other languages has elements in them that are similar to TCP. If you can learn how to do different hacks and codes with TCP, it will make it much easier for you to do them  with  UDP  and  ICMP.  There  are many  different  options  that  come  along with  each  of  the  languages,  and  that  is something that you will need to keep in mind when you are writing the different codes  that  are  present  in  the  hacking community.   for   stands     ICMP ICMP  Internet  Control Message Protocol. It is the main form of communication  that  you  will  use  if  you are  not  using  TCP  and  it  is  something that is intended to be used to be able to communicate. You can send and receive messages,  create  messages  on  the Internet,  and  send  out  alerts  that  tell people  what  you  are  doing  with  the different  that  are present in your own system. It is a great  types  of  hacking    option for people who want to learn the simplest hacking language, and it can be helpful for many different applications. The  biggest  problem  with  ICMP  is  that you  are  unable  to  use  it  for  anything other  than  communication.  You  cannot write  new  codes  with  it,  and  you  will need to make sure that you are getting the most  out  of  it  each  time  that  you  do something  on  it.  There  are  many problems  with  ICMP,  but  making  sure that  you  keep  all  of  this  in  mind  each time that you deal with it will allow you the  chance  to  make  sure  that  you  are   getting  the  most  out  of  it.  While  it  is relatively  useless  compared  to  TCP  or even UDP, it is something that can help you  learn  what  some  of  the  hacking elements  are  in  each  of  the  languages that you may use. UDP UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol. It does not have quite as many elements as  TCP,  but  it  does  give  you  good options  for  including  different  things with your hacks. There are many of the programs  that  are  included  with  UDP   that  are  similar  to  TCP.  If  you  have learned TCP as your first language, you will likely not need to learn much more to be able to follow the UDP aside from specific  codes  and  hacks  that  will change the way that you do things. When it comes to UDP, you should learn as much as possible before you try to do it  or  try  to  make  sure  that  it  works  for you.  There  are  many  different  options that can be different depending on what you want to be able to do so make sure that your UDP languages are as broad as possible.  Learning  as  much  as  you  can   about  UDP  will  guarantee  that  you  are getting the most out of it and that you are able  to  truly  appreciate  the  hacking languages. Learning all three of the languages is the only  way  that  you  will  be  able  to achieve  an  expert  level  of  hacking  and be  able  to  do  everything  that  you  need with your different experiences.   that   Linux The majority of people who are hackers or  choose  to  use  the  hacking  languages use  Linux.  This  is  an  easy  to  use operating  system  is  not  much different from Windows or MAC. It can be installed on nearly any computer and will give you what you need to be able to hack effectively. The benefits of Linux is  that  it  is  specifically  designed  to  be able  to  used  for  hacking  and  does  not include  some  of  the  unneeded  features that  are  included  with  other  operating   systems. It  is  always  a  good  idea  to  get  Linux because of how simple it is. This will be your best option for starting out and will give  you  a  chance  to  do  as  much  as possible  with  the  hacking  that  you  are planning  on  doing.  There  are  many options for hacking and Linux gives you the chance to be able to use each one of them in a way that makes sense for you. Cain and Abel Despite  the  fact  that  Linux  is  your  best option for hacking and it will be the best   program  for  you  to  be  able  to  use,  you can  also  use  other  operating  systems. You just need to make sure that each of them  will  be  up  to  par  with  what  you want to do when it comes to hacking and that you are getting the most out of each of them. It is a good idea to try different things with your programs and see what you  are  able  to  do  with  the  operating system that you have been using. One  of  the  options  for  people  who  are not  using  Linux  because  they  already have  Windows  or  a  different  operating system  is  Cain  and  Abel.  This  is  a   program that will allow you the chance to make sure that you are getting the most out  of  everything  with  hacking  and  that you are able to hack effectively. Getting Cain  and  Abel  for  your  computer  is simple and is something that you will be able  to  do  effectively.  It  is  much  less expensive and easier than trying to get a Linux  operating  system  when  you  are first getting started with hacking and not making money from it. Collection of Information One of the easiest things that you can try   with  your  new  hacking  skills  and software  is  collecting  information.  This can be done through keystroke loggers or any other type of software. It is ideal for anyone  who  wants  to  be  able  to  learn about hacking. One of the first things that people  do  with  their  hacking  skills  is collect  information.  When  you  know how to do that, you can then expand on all  of  the  other  hacking  skills  that  you need to be able to do more with it. As  you  learn  more  about  hacking,  you will learn different parts of the language. Because you are learning more each time   you do a new hack, you will need to first learn the basics. The basic parts of each of  the  languages  are  similar,  and  they will give you a chance to make sure that you are doing the most with your hacking experience.  Learn  all  of  the  languages, practice  on  the  software  and  constantly expand  your  knowledge  if  you  want  to be  able  to  be  the  best  hacker  possible and  get  the  most  out  of  the  hacking experience  that  you  have  created  for yourself in your practices.     Chapter 4: Differences  in Hacking  There  are  two  basic  types  of  hacking: passive  and  active.  Beyond  these  two types,  there  are  many  different  sections that  fit  into  each  one  and  make  the difference  up  in  the  way  that  things  are able to be hacked and what each hacker is able to do about each thing. There are many different options when it comes to hacking  and  making  sure  that  you  know how to do different types of hacking will   eventually  help  to  make  you  the  best hacker  possible  and  will  give  you  a chance  at  gaining  some  of  the  very important  skills  that  come  along  with hacking. Just make sure that you can do each one of these in a way that works for you.   Passive Attacks The  passive  attacks  that  you  do  are  the easiest type of hacks to start with. They do  not  require  you  to  do  any  active work,  and  you  can  just  set  the  hack  up   and sit back while you are waiting for it to happen. Passive attacks are great for both  beginners  and  others  because  they allow  you  the  chance  to  take  your  time setting it up instead of having to set it all up when you are ready to do it. Replay Attacks One of the easiest replay attacks to do is to install your software on the computer and allow it to sit for a short period of time.  Let  it  pick  up  on  all  of  the  things that  the  person  does  to  get  into  the computer,  any  including   putting    keystrokes  in  or  doing  anything  that  is similar to that. You can then allow it to track  all  of  that  so  that  it  will  be included in it and it will allow you the chance  to  make  sure  that  you  are  doing things the right way. As  you  are  waiting,  you  can  collect  all of  the  information  that  you  need.  If  you are trying to get a virus off, you should make sure that the software that you are using  is  able  to  pick  up  the  different things that the virus may be doing. That could  be  the  key  to  killing  the  virus  on the computer and getting the system back   to where it needs to be. Just be sure that you are able to get that information with your software. Sitting Ducks Another great passive attack that you can use  allows  you  to  sit  and  wait  for something to happen on the computer. It will allow you the chance to make sure that  you  are  getting  the  best  experience and  that  you  are  able  to  get  all  of  the information  the computer.  By  waiting  passively  for changes  to  be  made  to  the  operating  that  you  need  on    system, you will give yourself a way to simply  just  appear  and  make  things happen with your hack. It will also give you  a  chance  to  ensure  that  you  are getting the most out of the attack. There  are  several  different  options  for this type of attack. In general, you do not need to worry about whether or not you are  local  or  remote  to  the  operating system or the computer because you can do it all through the back door. There are many different options that you have  for  this  type  of  attack,  and  it  will   give you a chance to make sure that you are doing it the right way. If you choose the right type of attack for what you want to do, you can get the most out of sitting and waiting to attack. Active Attacks As  you  learn  more  about  the  different types  of  attacks,  you  will  be  able  to carry out active attacks more frequently. Active attacks give you a chance to make sure that you are getting the most out of them and that you are able to do the most with  your  different  attacks.  There  are   many  different  things  that  are  included with  active  attacks,  and  you  can  learn from  what  you  have  done  with  passive attacks.  Active  attacks,  though,  require you  to  do  more  when  it  comes  to  your hacking skills. The  biggest  difference  is  that  you  will need to act quickly. As soon as you make the decision to carry out an active attack, you  will  need  to  be  ready  to  make  that attack. Whether that means that you need to  prepare  in  advance  or  just  know  the codes all of the time that you are going to  use,  you  should  be  ready  to  do  the   active  attacks  if  that  is  something  that you  feel  you  will  need  to  do  to  make sure that you are getting the most out of the  experience  of  hacking  and  what  it can provide for you. Masquerade Attacks Out of all of the different active attacks that  you  will  to  do, masquerade attacks are both the simplest and  the  most  popular  in  the  world  of active  hacking.  You  will  need  to  learn how  to  do  these  if  you  want  to  be  the best hacker possible and if you want to  learn  how    make  sure  that  you  are  getting  the  most out of the experiences that you have. It is a good idea to learn this hack when you are  first  getting  started  with  active hacking so that you will be able to build from it later on. The masquerade attack is one where you disguise  yourself  as  a  user  on  the computer.  You  would  gather  the information that you need from the target and replicate it to be able to use it later on. This would allow you the chance to make  sure  that  you  are  getting  the  most out of it and that you are going to be able   to  promote  the  different  things  that  are included  with  the  experience.  You  can make  sure  that  you  have  mapped  the targets  in  each  of  the  different  ways  so that  you  can  put  them  back  where  they belong,  and  so  you  can  get  into  the system. Mapping Targets is The  process  of  mapping  perhaps one of the most difficult aspects of  hacking  and  can  be  different depending on the different situation that you are in and what you are doing with  targets    your  hacking.  If  you  are  going  to  be  an active hacker, you need to learn how to map  targets  so  that  you  will  be  able  to get  into  the  system.  The  targets  will make a difference in where you go once you have gotten into the computer or the operating  system  that  you  are  trying  to hack. The  target  should  be  something  simple — like the password of the computer — once you have learned this, you can often do much more with the computer, change things  around,  remove  files,  and  add software  to  keep  it  from  happening   again. You can also use the password, or any type of target, to figure out what type of malicious software is on the computer and  what  can  be  done  about  it.  Make sure  that  you  know  what  you  are  doing and that you are able to add the different options  onto  it  each  time  that  you  do something  with  the  computer.  Once  you have mapped your targets, you should be good to go.   Finding Weaknesses There is always a weakness in a system.   No  matter  how  good  the  system,  how secure or anything like that, there will be a  weakness  in  it  and  you  will  have  to deal  with  that  weakness.  You  should make  sure  that  you  are  able  to  find  the various  weaknesses  and  that  you  are getting the most out of it. There are many different  weaknesses  computer systems — from the way that they are set up  to  the  information  that  they  have  on them — that you can make sure that you are getting the most out of. As  you  are  working  the weakness, this will allow you the chance  find   in   to    to explore the system. Even if you think you have figured out where the weakness is going to be, you may be surprised to find  that  it  is  actually  in  a  different location. By exposing the weakness, you will  give  yourself  the  best  access possible to the target that you are going after.  If  you  are  not  finding  a  weakness in  the  system,  you  may  consider  asking someone to help you out so that you can figure  out  exactly  what  you  are  doing with it and where you are going with it. Testing it Out   test   After you have figured out how you are going  to  get  into  the  computer  or  the specific  operating  system,  you  need  to make sure that is something that you are going to be able to do. You should check the  system,  the  weakness,  and proceed if there are no problems. Since there  are  often  problems,  you  should plan your first attempt to be only a test. If it goes smoothly, you can try to do the hack from that point, but it may be harder for you to be able to do. If you make a choice to continue with the hack, be prepared to do it once you are   in.  Despite  the  fact  that  you  were  only supposed to be testing it, it is possible to do  a  high-quality  hack  from  the  testing stage.  If  you  are  just  testing  it  and  you are not able to get into the system, do not give up. Go back and try to find another weak  spot.  Most  systems  have  several different  weaknesses,  and  you  will  be able  to  take  advantage  of  that  as  you learn more about the different hacks. Getting into the System The  weakness  is  the  key  to  opening  up the  system,  but  you  still  need  to  make sure  that  you  are  able  to  get  into  the   system. It can be hard to be able to get into the system, but once you are in, you should be able to figure out the different hacks  that  you  need  to  do.  Even  if  the files  are  locked  with  a  password,  it  is often  the  same  as  what  the  computer password is so that, as long as you know what that is, you will be able to get to a point where you are getting the most out of  the  experience,  and  you  are  able  to include everything that you need on your hack. Be aware that there may be some things that  are  installed  on  the  computer  that   are meant to keep hackers out. Keep that in  mind  when  you  are  hacking  and  be prepared to get through a firewall so that you will not have to worry about it once you are in. Hacking a firewall is nearly as simple as getting into a computer, and it can almost always be done as long as you  target appropriately. Learning New Hacks Once  you  have  learned  passive  attacks, you  should  then  move  onto  active attacks.  Once  you  have  learned  active attacks,  you  need  to  keep  learning  as  have  mapped   your    many new ones as you want. This can be anything  from  old  to  new  to  passive  or even active, and the hacks will be many different  things.  Don’t  just  learn  the script for the hacks, but learn the reason behind  it  and  what  you  can  do  to  make sure that you are getting the most out of the hacking experience. Try different things to get to the hacking point  that  you  want.  Try  to  learn  more hacks and figure out how to do them in a way  that  makes  sense.  There  are  many different  ways  to  hack,  and  just  one  of them is not going to make a difference in   the different things that you can do. It is important  that  you  learn  what  you  can about  hacking  and  how  to  write  your own codes. Once you have learned how to  write  your  own  scripts  for  hacking instead of just changing around ones that are already made, you will be able to be the best hacker possible and get the most out of the hacking experience.   Chapter 5: Starting to  Hack    Learning  the  basics  and  the  things  that you  need  to  know  about  hacking  are important  but  actually  doing  it  is  more important if you want to be able to make it  work  for  you.  There  are  different things that you must know how to do for different types of hacking. Learning what these things are, how to use them and the right  way  to  hack  will  allow  you  the   chance to make sure that you are getting the most out of the hacking process and that you will be able to truly become a great hacker. Hacking a Network The most useful hack is one that allows you  the  chance  to  do  something  in  the time that you are normally used to doing it. For example, a good hack is one that you can use both in hacking and in your everyday life, and you should make sure that  you  are  able  to  use  the  majority  of your  hacks  all  of  the  time  that  you  are   online  or  in  different  situations.  It  is  a good idea to try different things when it comes  to  hacking,  and  one  of  the  most important things that you should be able to  try  is  hacking  a  network.  This  will allow you to get onto a wireless network and get the information that you need. You will first need to find a program that is  able  to  go  back  to  the  roots  of  the network.  You  will  also  need  to  find  a network that works for you and one that will  be  able  to  make  sure  that  you  are getting  signal  possible. Backtrack  into  the  program  to  see  the  the  best    specifics  of  the  wi-fi,  and  you  will  be able to see the password that goes along with  the  wi-fi.  Write  it  down  and  keep track of where you put it so that you are able  to  use  it  for  a  second  time.  This will  allow  you  to  get  into  the  network when  you  go  back  to  the  original  after you have backtracked. Now that you have the password, all you need  to  do  is  go  back  to  the  wi-fi  and select the network. Simply enter the key, and you will be able to use the network. This hack is especially beneficial if you are somewhere that does not have a lot   of options for strong wi-fi. Finding Passwords There are two ways that you can hack a password.  The  first  way  is  easy  but  it requires physical effort, and you must be close  to  the  computer.  The  easier  way for you to figure out what a password is to  do  it  from  a  remote  location  that allows you the chance to make sure that you  are  able  to  get  the  password  no matter what type of information you are getting. This is a good idea because you don’t need to be present at the computer   and  you  don’t  need  to  worry  about  the way  that  you  are  going  to  get  to  the computer. The  first  way  is  to  get  to  the  computer and find the password. You can do this with a program, or you can choose to do it manually so that you are able to get the exact password that you need. The first way  to  do  it  is  manual.  You  will  just need  to  watch  and  see  which  keys  the person puts in to get the exact password. You  will  then  be  able  to  see  what  they are doing on the computer and what they have saved on it. You can also choose to   the   and   put  a  physical  software  device  on  the computer.  All  you  will  need  to  do  is plug  the  keystroke  logger  in  for  a  few minutes,  computer  will automatically  pick  up  on  it  and  allow you to see what the password is the next time  that  the  person  types  it  in.  The biggest  problem  with  doing  this  is  that you  have  to  be  physically  close  to  the computer  to  be  able  to  do  it  and  you must  make  sure  that  you  are  getting  the passwords without them noticing. It  is  much  easier  to  hack  into  their system  from  a  remote  location  and   the  software  onto   download  their computer  without  having  to  be  in  the actual location. Just learn how to get in their  system   map  the  weakness   and enter  in.  From  there,  you  can  learn  the password, or you can simply bypass the password to get the information that you need  and  get  into  the  computer.  It  will allow  you  the  chance  to  make  sure  that you are getting the computer information that you need and you will be able to be included in all of the information on the computer each time that you log on.     Getting in the Backdoor A backdoor entry into a computer is just a different way of getting into it without having to go through all of the different steps of the process. The “backdoor” is essentially  just  using  something  that  is similar to a Trojan to be able to get into the  program  that  you  want  without having to go into the program through the regular way. It is not moral or ethical to use the backdoor on a regular basis, but it  is  sometimes  necessary  especially  if someone  has  been  locked  out  of  their own computer or something and does not   have the actual password that they need to be able to get into the program. To  use  the  backdoor,  you  will  simply need to create a program that is similar to  another  program.  Make  it  something that  is  believable  so  that  nobody  will know  that  it  is  mocked  up.  Fill  it  with the software that you want instead of the software that it looks like and send it to the  computer.  The  person  who  opens  it will  think  that  they  are  downloading what  the  program  looks  like  but  they will  actually  be  downloading  the software  that  you  put  into  the  fake   program. There  are  many  times  when  you  could simply put one type of software into the backdoor through the use of a program, but you could also do it with several of the  different  software  options  into  the computer.  This  is  the  way  that  you  turn your  program  from  a  simple  backdoor entry program into something that can be used as a Trojan. You should make sure that you are only doing this if you want the  computer  to  have  all  of  the  options that  are  included  with  your  Trojan  so that  you  are  able  to  do  it  the  best  way   possible. You should always think about what you are  doing  and  whether  it  is  up  to  your own  ethical  standards  before  you  use  a backdoor entry or Trojan program. This is something that you will need to think about before you have the chance to do more  with  it  and  you  should  decide  on whether it is a good idea or not. There are  many  options  that  can  be  used instead  of  backdoor  programs.  Always choose  the backdoor  one,  because  most  of  these options are much more ethical for you to  this  before  you  choose    use. Replicating the Wi-Fi If  you  want  to  be  able  to  use  the  wi-fi network  without  anyone  knowing  that you are using it, you can just replicate it. You  can  also  do  this  if  you  need  to create  a  second  network  without  the need for the first one at all. It will allow you  the  chance  to  make  sure  that  things are being done the right way and that you are  getting  the  most  out  of  the  different things  that  are  included  with  the  wi-fi passwords.  There  are  many  different   ways  that  you  can  change  the  way  that the  wi-fi  works  and  several  benefits  to it. The first thing that you will need to do is figure out what the server is for the wi- fi.  You  can  use  several  different programs to do this, but a good program will  allow  you  to  do  it  all  from  one single  application.  It  will  give  you  the chance to make sure that you are getting the server information as well as the wi- fi information all from the same location. You  should  make  sure  that  you  include each  of  the  different  options  with  your   wi-fi  and  that  you  will  be  able  to  do more  with  the  wi-fi  options  that  you have. After  you  have  gotten  the  server information,  all  you  need  to  do  is replace the wi-fi with the new one. This will require you to choose the one with the strongest signal and replicate it with a  new  name.  The  name  should  look  the same as the old one so that people will still click on it but it will actually go to the  new  network  that  you  created.  This will give you a chance to have people on your wi-fi network.   After  you  have  created  your  new network,  there  are  several  different things  that  you  can  do.  You  can  learn what  people  are  doing  online,  you  can track their information, and you can even use  keystroke  loggers  to  pick  up  the information  that  they  put  into  password fields. This will allow you the chance to see  in passwords.  This  hack  is  especially beneficial if you need to find out a lot of information  about  different  people  and different users on the Internet because it allows you to pick up on different things.  there  are  differences   that    There are not many white hat benefits of replicating  the  wi-fi  but  knowing  the skill can be useful.   How to Spoof Perhaps  one  of  the  oldest  forms  of hacking  is  spoofing.  This  is  creating  a website or a program that looks the same as another one and leading the user to a different site so that you will be able to either  track  their  information  or  steal something  that  is  different  from  the different  options.  There  are  many   reasons that you may want to do this, but you will first need to learn what it is. By learning the information on spoofing, you will  be  able  to  begin  doing  spoofs  and making  sure  that  you  have  each  of  the different  options  included  with  your spoofing techniques. Despite the fact that you are going to be able to do different things with spoofing, you  should  first  make  sure  that  you  are doing it the right way. The spoof should look  exactly  like  the  website,  email  or text message that you are trying to make it  look  like.  This  will  allow  you  the   chance  to  show  people  what  you  have done so that you are getting the most out of the situation and so that you are able to include all of the information with the spoof. Try your best to be sure that you have made it look the best. If you want to take the information from the person, you just need a simple form on the site. Make it somewhere that they will go to easily on the safe and that you will be able to enter it into the site. By making  sure  all  of  this  is  going  to happen,  you  will  be  doing  your  best  at creating a spoof. The person will go to   the site or the page and will enter their information  in,  that  information  will appear to be on the site that they wanted to go to, but it will actually go to you. Spoofing  is  not  good  for  white  hat hackers.  It  is  not  something  that  you would  be  able  to  use,  and  you  should have a strong ethical code before you try to  do  it  for  any  reason.  Just  make  sure that you are doing it for the right reasons and that you are going to be able to use it for  that  purpose.  While  spoofing  can also be used just for fun, it is something that you should try to avoid because it is   associated with black hat hacking.     Chapter 6: Making  Hacking Yours    Hacking can be both something that you enjoy and something that is profitable if you  know  the  right  way  to  do  it.  There are several different options that you can do  when  you  are  a  hacker  to  make money,  but  the  majority  of  the  options that  will  help  you  make  money  with hacking are a great way for you to make sure  that  you  are  doing  the  best  job   possible. Hacking can be a fun hobby, or it can help you to make some money — the  choice  is  yours  and  will  depend  on how much effort you choose to put into it. Learning the Skills Learning  the  definitions  of  hacking  and the  various  terms  that  you  may  come across  is  one  thing  but  learning  how  to put  this  information  into  practice  is something  else  is  completely different.  As  you  are  the different  terms  that  are  outlined  in  this  learning   that    book, you also need to learn how to do them.  Make  sure  that  you  are  keeping track  of  the  terms  and  how  you  plan  to use them and to learn how to make them work for you. The  more  skills  that  you  have  when  it comes  to  hacking,  the  more  marketable you will be. You should make sure that you  are  marketing  yourself  in  the  best way  possible  and  that  you  are  learning as  much  as  you  can  about  the  different things that you can do in hacking. It is a good  idea  to  learn  everything  that  you can, even if it seems like you won’t use   it  at  any  point  throughout  your  hacking career. As long as you are able to learn things, there is no limit to what you can do with hacking. Try your best at everything that is related to hacking. Even if it seems like a skill that  you  will  not  be  able  to  do  or something that you are not good at, you should try your best to be able to learn about it. If you are struggling to learn the different  things  about  hacking  or something  is  not  making  sense  to  you, consider  asking  an  experienced  person for  help.  A  mentor  will  always  be  a   good idea when you are learning how to hack. It is a good idea to find someone who can help you and who knows what they are doing. Quick Improvements Learning  as  much  as  you  can  about hacking  will  take  some  time.  It  may  be hard  for  you  if  you  have  never  hacked before  or  if  you  have  no  experience when it comes to hacking. Make sure that you  learn  what  you  can  about  hacking, and  this  will  allow  you  the  chance  to make  sure  that  you  are  doing  the  most   with  your  hacking  experience.  You should  make  sure  that  you  are  taking your  time,  but  if  you  are  able  to  speed things up, you can take advantage of the reduced amount of time that it takes to be able to learn more about hacking. It is a good idea to try your best and to move forward with different things. The more  that  you  know,  the  more  that  you will be able to learn and the more time you will be able to take at learning new things. This means that you should try to make sure that you are learning as much as possible but that you are also doing it   in  an  efficient  manner  —  the  less  time you take, the more time you have to learn more about hacking and other things that go along with hacking.     A Mentor Having someone who can help you learn about  hacking  and  the  different  aspects of  it  is  always  helpful,  but  you  should make sure that it is someone who knows what they are doing. Despite the fact that you  may  teach  that  you  can   think    yourself, having someone there to check your work as you go will enable you to have  a  better  time  with  the  different options  that  you  have  with  hacking. Make sure that you learn as much as you can and that you are able to get a lot of experience from the person. A  person  who  is  your  mentor  will  be able  to  help  you  understand  what hacking  does,  how  it  works,  and  the different codes that you can use when it comes  to  your  hacking  experience.  The person  who  mentors  you  should  be someone  who  knows  what  they  are   doing,  someone  who  is  patient,  and someone who you feel comfortable with each time that you work with them. They will be able to give you a lot of help if they are the right person and they know what they are doing when it comes to the hacking experience. Helping with Codes There are many different codes that you need  to  make  your  hacking  experience better.  It  is  a  good  idea  to  write  down codes  as  you  learn  them.  Whether  you are  putting  them  into  a  document  or   physically writing them down, you will be able to remember them and find them when  you  are  looking  for  them.  It  is  a good idea to try your best to write down all  of  the  codes  that  you  learn  —  you never know when you will want to find a great code and you just can’t remember it. You  should  also  learn  as  much  about codes as possible so that you don’t have to  worry  about  the  different  things  that go  into  changing  things  around.  There are  many  different  options  for  people who  want  to  add  more  to  their  hacking   background  but  who  do  not  have  that experience.  You  should  make  sure  that you  know  codes  that  you  can  change around and that you can add to instead of just  copying  down  the  codes  that  you have learned. As long as you are able to learn the codes that allow you the chance to write down different things, you will be able to make sure that you are getting the  most  out  of  the  experience.  It  is always a good idea to try your best with codes and try to add to them to see what you are doing. Despite the fact that you are learning as   much  as  you  can  about  hacking  and  the codes that go along with it, you will still not know everything that you can about it and about what it means to the different communities  that  are  a  part  of  it.  Just trying your best to be able to learn more about codes will give you the chance to learn  more,  and  you  will  not  need  to worry  about  the  different  issues  that come along with coding. The more that you learn about codes, the more  independent  you  will  be  with hacking.  One  of  the  largest  benefits  of coding and learning what you can about   codes  is  that  you  will  be  able  to  make sure  that  you  are  doing  things  the  right way  and  that  you  are  writing  all  of  the correct  codes.  You  will  eventually  go from simple hacks to complicated ones, and  you  will  even  be  able  to  design software that will work well with your computer and with other computers. Protection Your security is important when you are hacking.  While  there  are  many  more good hackers than there are bad hackers, you still need to watch out for the ones   that  are  bad  and  the  ones  who  want  to counter-hack  you  or  get  into  your computer in some way. There are many problems that come along with this, and you  should  always  make  sure  that  you are doing the best job possible from the different  options  that  you  have.  It  is  a good idea for you to be able to add more to the way that you do things. As  long  as  you  are  working  your  way toward  success,  there  will  likely  be some people who will want to bring you down.  Keep  your  mind  on  these  things while  you  are  hacking  and  to  allow   yourself  the  chance  to  make  the  right decisions.  If  you  protect  yourself  while you are hacking, you will not be subject to  the  attacks  that  come  from  other hackers  or  black  hat  people  who  are trying to make things harder for you. Try your best to stay out of the way and don’t do anything that could provoke the black hatters to do something to you. One of the best ways that you can protect yourself is to be a part of a community. You need to find people who are similar to  you  and  who  have  the  same  hacking goals as what you have so that they will   be  able  to  help  you  with  the  different things  that  you  can  do.  There  are  many different  options  that  come  along  with hacking  and  having  a  strong  community within  your  reach  will  give  you  the chance to make things better for yourself. There  are  many  different  problems  that may come from not having a community and having a lot of enemies is just one of them that can bring harm to your hacking hobby. If you are doing everything that you can to be a good hacker and you try to stay out of the way of the black hat hackers,   you will not likely ever cross paths with them. You should make sure that you are doing your best to stay around the people who  are  good  hackers  and  who  do  not have any interest in black hat tactics. It is  a  good  idea  to  try  to  do  more  with your  experience  and  to  do  everything that  you  can  with  the  different  options that  are  in  your  hacking community. Your number one priority, as a hacker, is to  protect  yourself  from  malicious hackers.  included    Looking Ahead In  the  future,  security  on  the  Internet  is going to be much different from what it is  today.

The following chapters will explain to you how you can go from knowing nothing about hacking to learning the basics that you will need to know to get started. The most important thing to learn is that there are different types of hackers. There are ones who are able to do things for good, for bad, and for reasons that nobody but them knows about. Learn a little about each of the types of hackers so that you will know which type you want to be (and which you don’t want to be).
