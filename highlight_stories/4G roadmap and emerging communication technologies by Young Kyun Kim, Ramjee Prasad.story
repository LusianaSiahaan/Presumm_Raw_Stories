shortage of information on 4G for both academics and industry. This dis- cussion motivated us to write a book on 4G that will help the researchers and engineers to understand the fundamental nature of future 4G wireless commu- nication systems and will answer the questions: What is 4G and where it will lead us? As 4G is rapidly becoming the center of attention of industry and acade- mia, we authors, representing both groups, approached this vast subject from a wide perspective, aiming to provide the reader with a complete and timely vision of future communication systems. We live in an exciting time, the foundations of 4G are being discussed and developed, and huge international aim to find a global consensus on 4G. Attempts to define 4G abound, but paradoxically, it is hard to find a widely accepted universal definition of 4G. Along this book we  xiii   xiv  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  will approach 4G from several directions, striving for clarity and openness in the discussions.  This book addresses in a comprehensive and balanced way the major driv- ing forces behind 4G systems, including scenarios, enabling technologies, and applications. Roadmaps, expectations, and visions for 4G systems are also dis- cussed. Background information and the evolutionary development of wireless technologies for future 4G networks are considered in detail. The book also goes deeper into the technical difficulties and challenges of 4G implementation. In addition to dealing with the fundamental aspects of the air interfaces and net- working, the reader gets a complete panorama of other 4G related issues, includ- ing key technologies, spectrum, standardization, ongoing worldwide research cooperation projects, and the impact of 4G on future communications equip- ment, in particular 4G terminals. It is the first book to discuss many of the chal- lenges in the advancement of 4G, including the technical and practical realities of the progression to 4G. We wrote this book for the following types of readers: technologists, engineers, scientists, lecturers and professors, and Ph.D. candi- dates; and with the objective to have a single source reference that offers detailed information about 4G on the topics as shown in Figure P.1.

We have tried our best to make each chapter complete in itself. This book will give successful direction to researchers and engineers working in universi- ties, research laboratories, and industry for making 4G happen. We cannot claim that the book is errorless. Any remarks to improve the text and correct any errors would be greatly appreciated.

Analog wireless communication systems were replaced by digital ones, voice services are being complemented with data services, supported data transfer speeds have increased by more than a thousand-fold, network coverage has been stretched to cover virtually entire countries and continents, and many other remarkable achievements have taken place in a relatively short period. Many visions, even the most optimistic ones, failed to foresee that in just a quar- ter century the number of mobile subscribers will approach one-third of the world’s population and surpass wireline subscribers. Unveiling the future of wireless systems was then perhaps a more difficult task than it would be today, since now we can expect that part of the future wireless networks will be the result of an evolution of the current networks. Establishing a sound vision of future mobile communications systems is one of the main purposes of this book. Large portions of this book will be devoted to the present and discuss future 4G networks from different perspectives [1-110].  1   2  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  Presently, as third generation  3G  International Mobile Telecommunica- tions 2000  IMT-2000  systems are being deployed, further developments aim- ing at their enhancement are being conducted on a worldwide scale. These research and development activities surrounding Beyond 3G  B3G  systems tar- get not only the task of creating a universal vision of future mobile communica- tions systems but also the identification and further evaluation of technical solutions for realizing such systems. All these initiatives are mainly driven by the ever-increasing growth in the number of subscribers as well as by users’ demands of high-speed connectivity on the move. The demand of ubiquitous multimedia services in a personalized fashion is the most salient requirement of future users. When this is seen from the perspective of millions of users, one can easily see that such broadband services will require the integration of several wireless net- works of different types, including networks supporting much higher data rates than what we are accustomed to experience today. In the broadest sense, the fourth generation  4G  networks will integrate technologies from broadcasting networks to wide area and metropolitan networks down to smaller networks like wireless local and personal area networks, all under the umbrella of a single, monolithic network: the 4G network. Data rates are really what broadband is about. It is expected that broadband wireless communications will support applications up to 1 Gbps. We can say that two major paths will conduct us towards 4G, namely, through evolution of current systems, and through revolu- tion by creating new systems able to provide very high data throughputs. These two approaches will coexist and be complementary. In this visionary perspective of the road ahead, in order to keep pace with society’s communication needs in the years to come, capacity will be one of the major issues to be developed due to the foreseen increase in demand for new services  especially those based on mul- timedia . Together with this, personal mobility will impose new challenges to the development of new personal and mobile communications systems.  A conclusion can be drawn from this: Even if at a certain point it may appear academic to develop a system for a capacity much higher than what seems reasonable  in the sense that it is not straightforward to identify applica- tions requiring such high capacity , it is still worthwhile since almost certainly future applications will come out that need a capacity of 1 Gbps or even more. The story of fiber optics plays this out. Moreover, high capacity networks will reduce service costs dramatically; helping 4G to get a solid grip after it is launched. Higher data rates can be also justified from the user terminal stand- point. Indeed, as advanced terminals with audio and imaging capabilities are becoming more and more common, need for much higher network data throughput capabilities will arise due to the expected enormous increase of traf- fic in both uplink and downlink. Rapid development will shrink the world into a global information multimedia communication village  GIMCV  by 2020. Figure 1.1 illustrates the basic concept of a GIMCV, which consists of version   Introduction  3  National and international zones  Global information multimedia communication village  Personal area network   PAN   Macrocells:   Suburban   Regional   National  Microcells:      City-centers Highways  Picocells: in-house  Figure 1.1 Global information multimedia communication village.  components of different scales ranging from global to pico-cellular in size. Figure 1.2 shows a family tree of the GIMCV system [1].  The passage from generation to generation is not only characterized by an increase in the data rate, but also by the transition from pure circuit switched  CS  systems to CS-voice packed data and IP-core-based systems, as is high- lighted in Figure 1.3 [1-94].  1.1 Visions  Economic and technical trends together with applications requirements will drive the future of mobile communications. As will be discussed in the next chapter, the increase of the mobile subscriber base will be accompanied by a sharp increase of data usage. Ultimately, it is expected that the volume of data traffic will substantially exceed that of voice traffic. Mobile Internet, one of the main drivers for multimedia applications, will speed up this process.  The number of mobile subscribers has increased much faster than expected and it will continue to grow through the 2000s. The universal mobile telecommunications system  UMTS  Forum expects that in Europe more than 90 million mobile subscribers will use mobile multimedia services in 2010, with a data traffic share of about 60% of the total traffic. Worldwide mobile Internet subscribers are expected to top half a billion in the same year, according to the same source. Even higher figures are expected in Asia. Additional frequency assignment will be necessary for 3G to accommodate the growing demand. The bandwidth to be added is assumed to be of several hundred megaherts in 2010.   4  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  B-PAN  Broadband services  WPAN, HSDPA,WiMax  High bit rate multimedia services IMT-2000  UMTS  Speech and data  PHS  PHP  GSM  DCS1800 GPRS   EDGE PDC  Digital speech  TACS  ETACS RTMS C-450 NMT450  900  Future generation  4th generation  3.5 G  3rd generation  2.5 G  2nd generation  1st generation  1980  2020  2010  2005  2000 1995  Global  PACS  IS95  DECT CT2  CT2+  International  IS54  136  1990 JTAC  NTACS  RADIOCOM- 2000  N T T  AMPS  Analog speech Analog speech Analog speech Analog speech  Local   international  Figure 1.2 Family tree of the GIMCV.

Introduction  5  However, the added bandwidth greatly depends on the growth ratio of traffic per subscribers. Therefore, study of high capacity cellular systems with improved spectrum efficiency and new bands is necessary to accommodate growing traffic in 2010 and beyond. Higher data rates and wireless Internet access are key components of the future mobile communications systems. They are also key concepts in 3G systems as well. Future mobile communications sys- tems should bring something more than just faster data or wireless Internet access [28, 57, 58]. Something that we are missing today, even in 3G, is the flex- ible and seamless interoperability of various existing networks like cellular, cord- less, wireless local area network  WLAN  type systems, systems for short connectivity, and wired systems. One of the greatest challenges for 4G is to inte- grate the whole worldwide communication infrastructure to form one transpar- ent network allowing various and different access systems to connect into it depending on the user’s needs, location, and network availability. The heteroge- neity of various accesses is one of the principal distinctive aspects of future net- works. The different access systems are organized in a layered structure according to the application areas, cell ranges, and radio environments. This allows a flexible and scalable environment for system deployment [110].  The creation of this new network requires a completely new design approach. So far, most of the existing systems have been designed in isolation without taking into account a possible interworking with other access technolo- gies. Their system design is mainly based on the traditional vertical approach to support a certain set of services with a particular technology. The universal ter- restrial radio access  UTRA  concept has already combined the frequency divi- sion multiplexing  FDD  and time division multiplexing  TDD  components to support the different symmetrical and asymmetrical service needs in a spec- trum-efficient way. This is the first step to a more horizontal approach [59, 39] where different access technologies will be combined into a common platform to complement each other in an optimum way for different service requirements and radio environments. Because of the dominant role of Internet Protocol  IP -based data traffic, these access systems will be connected to a common, flex- ible and seamless IP-based core network. This will result in a lower infrastruc- ture cost, faster provisioning of new features, and easy integration of new network elements.  This network could be supported by technologies like JAVA Virtual Machines and CORBA. The vision of the seamless future network is shown in Figure 1.4.  The mobility management will be part of a new Media Access System, which serves as an interface between the core network and the particular access technology to connect a user via a single number for different access systems to the network. Global roaming for all access technologies is required. The internetworking between these different access systems in terms of horizontal   6  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  3G  384 Kbps  3GPP Rel 0x IMT-2000 CDMA direct spread + TDD  GPRS EDGE IMT-2000 TDMA single carrier  IMT-2000 CDMA multi carrier  and  20 Mbps  beyond  100 Mbps?

The latter will be handled in the common Media Access System and the core network. Multimode terminals and new appliances are also key components to support these different access technologies of the common platform seamlessly from the user perspective. These terminals may be adaptive, based on high signal processing power. Therefore, the concept of software defined radio, in which different access technologies can be supported by automatic adaptation to any available network technologies at any particular instance could be a key technol- ogy in the future perspective.  In order to realize the vision of systems beyond third generation, many technical challenges have to be solved. In spite of the 2-Mbps data rates achiev- able by 3G systems, the end user throughput of these systems could still be only a small fraction of the actual need of truly broadband systems, taking into consid- eration economic and practical efficiency. Scarcity of available radio spectrum still remains a bottleneck, and researchers worldwide are working on different spectrum-efficient techniques that can adapt to varying environmental condi- tions. The common aim is to exploit effectively the limited radio resources [23, 24], taking into account the interaction among different layers of the protocol stack. The best efficiency is achieved if the system is able to adapt to environmen- tal conditions that change in time, location, and even available service mixture. This leads to the investigation of adaptive radio interface and network systems   Introduction  7  where diversity means [60-69], coding method as well as type and gain [70-72], modulation method or order  M-QAM, M-PSK, multicode single code, multicarrier single carrier  [73-75], data rate, data packet size, channel allocation, and service selection can be adapted effectively. New radio access concepts [76], advanced reception techniques [77-82], smart antenna technology [63-72], and resource management issues [83-90] are the main research areas that could realize the major goals of future generation wireless systems [91].  1.2 Next Generation  Next generation, commonly known as the fourth generation, will mainly focus on wireless IP with self-provisioning of different multimedia services such as audio, video, and games. Note that all the considered access technologies over- lap each other to some extent in some areas of services, as illustrated in Figure 1.5 Thus, a move towards integration of technology is a logical next step to pro- vide service continuity and higher user experience  quality of experience , as suggested by Figure 1.6.  The ITU-R vision of future wireless communication systems also calls for integration of technologies, which are commonly known as heterogeneous sys- tems, B3G systems, or beyond IMT-2000  as described by the ITU  systems  to some people B3G could mean any standard or technology developed after 3G . Technology integration will provide adequate services to a user depending on mobility and availability. Of course, this involves several new challenges; for example, handover handoff or mobility, security, QoS, and cost efficiency. These issues should be resolved without changing the existing standards.  WWAN and WLAN service overlap  e.g., voice services   WWAN WWAN  WLAN WLAN  WPAN and WWAN service overlap, e.g.,  payment at vending machine   WPAN WPAN  WLAN and WPAN service overlap  e.g., wireless connection to printer; connection to backbone network   WWAN, WLAN and WPAN service overlap  e.g., network connectivity to provide real-time and nonreal-time services   Figure 1.5 WWAN, WPAN, and WLAN overlap.   8  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  Satellite and broadcast  Cellular  WiMax  WLAN  WPAN  IP  H e t e r o g e n e o u s  B e y o n d 3 G  4G  Figure 1.6 Future of telecommunications.  Seamless handover should be provided while a user moves from the network of one access technology to the other and from the domain of one stakeholder to the other. Seamless handover means the provision of seamless service while the user is mobile  i.e., the user does not perceive any disruption in service or quality even during handover .  The ITU-R vision also refers to a new air interface, also known as 4G. Since any new system takes about 10 years to develop and deploy  see Figure 1.7 , work on B3G and 4G has already started; a possible solution is given in [91]. The current market shows that 3G is being deployed and adopted slower than expected, and hopefully some lessons will be learned from it while develop- ing 4G [93].  As already mentioned, we expect that future 4G systems will develop in two ways, namely evolution and revolution, and once deployed, legacy net- works, their evolution, and newly developed networks will coexist under the umbrella of 4G [110]. From this standpoint, 4G has a integrative role, and a 4G network can be seen as a convergence platform encompassing highly heteroge- neous networks [111].  A possible future scenario is given in Figure 1.8, which shows all technolo- gies working together while providing all the services to the users anywhere and   Introduction  9  Deployment  Implementation  Spectrum allocation  Set goal  Set requirements  Standardization + enhancement  10 years  Figure 1.7 Time required for new technology development and deployment.

Research work should be done on seamless handover, which involves the study of several issues like security and QoS, which should be done at each protocol layer and network element. This topic itself will require further study on development methods and technologies including hardware, software, and firmware, and technologies like application specific integrated cir- cuits  ASICs . Another important research topic is software defined radio  SDR , which includes reconfigurability at every protocol layer.  WLANs provide roaming within LANs, and work is happening towards further enhancement in this field. While wireless wide area networks  WWANs  provide roaming too, the challenge now is to provide seamless roaming from one system to another, from one location to another, and from one network provider to another. In terms of security, both WLANs and WWANs have their own approach. The challenge is to provide the level of security required by the user while roaming from one system to another. The user must get end-to-end   Introduction  11  security independent of any system, service provider, or location. Security also incorporates user authentication, which can be related to another important issue: billing. Both security and roaming must be based on the kind of service a user is accessing. The required QoS must be maintained when a user roams from one system to other. Besides maintaining the QoS it should be possible to know the kind of service that can be provided by a particular system, service provider, and location. Work on integration of the WLANs and the wireless personal area network  WPANs  must also be done. The biggest technical challenge here will be the coexistence of the two devices, as both of them work in the same frequency band.  Another area of research for the next generation communications will be in the field of personal networks  PNs  [94]. PN provides a virtual space for users that spans a variety of infrastructure technologies and ad hoc networks. In other words, PNs provide a personal distributed environment where people interact with various companions, embedded or invisible computers, not only in their vicinity but potentially anywhere. Figure 1.9 portrays the concept of PNs. Several technical challenges arise with PNs-besides interworking between differ- ent technologies-some of which are security, self-organization, service discovery, and resource discovery [94].

It depends on who  manufacturers, operators, academia, regulatory bodies, users  and when  this is being written in June 2005  you ask. Moreover, answers might not depict a wholly homogeneous view, even within parties belonging to the same group. Fortunately, when trying to define 4G, one can find a number of similar visions that are shared by several of the forces behind 4G. This encourages us to think that a global common understanding on 4G can be attained. To show both the diversity and commonality of viewpoints on 4G, a few answers to the above question are shown.  1. Unlike 3G, which refers to a specific mobile standard and allows the transfer of data at a minimum accepted speed, 4G, or the fourth gener- ation of wireless communications, refers to a collection of technologies and standards that will find their way into a range of new ubiquitous computing and connections systems. In its earliest stages, 4G offers the promise of allowing users to connect to the Internet and one another through a variety of devices and standards anytime, anywhere, and at a wide range of speeds, from narrowband to broadband [95, 96].  2. 4G is defined as mobile telephony at data rates of 100 Mbps globally; that is, between any two points in the world. Locally, 1 Gbps will be possible [97].  3. The main characteristics of the next generation of mobile systems are  [98]:    A new air interface aiming for 50 to 100 Mbps deployable in 2010.   This is what defines 4G.     The integration of existing system to interwork with each other and  with the new interface.  This is what defines system beyond 3G.   4. The European vision for a fourth generation terrestrial system is a fully IP-based integrated system offering any kind of services at any time and able to support multiple classes of terminals. In order to accom- modate future services that require high capacity, a broadband compo- nent is envisioned with a target peak data cell throughput of more than 20 Mbps in vehicular environments, using a 50- to 100-MHz bandwidth [99].  5. 4G is defined as a network that is spectrum efficient and that can pro- vide high speed services over the air and offer seamless interoperability, roaming, and real content. It is always on, technologically transparent, and affordable with reasonable QoS and high security  100].   Introduction  13  6. 4G is an “ultra high-speed wireless network,” an information super- highway without cables. The new network will enable wireless, three-dimensional augmented, and virtual reality connection between phone users [101].  7. 4G is “wireless ad hoc peer-to-peer networking” [102]. 8. The final definition of 4G will have to include something as simple as this: if a consumer can do something at home or in the office while wired to the Internet, those consumers must be able to do it wirelessly in a fully mobile environment [102].  9. 4G is a system of systems that can take advantage of all kinds of differ-  ent wireless technology [101].  10. Some would call 4G mobile broadband services, but that was suppos- edly the definition of 3G. An alternate proposition is that 4G repre- sents the multinetwork environment of WWAN and WLAN [103].  11. The definition of 4G that ITU-R approved in June 2003 states that the data rates should be around 100 Mbps when moving fast  like in a train  and 1 Gbps when not moving [104].  Based on the above 4G characterizations and several others [105-109], one may attempt to summarize the visions into a single definition, encompassing key features foreseen for 4G. The 4G will be a fully IP-based integrated system of sys- tems and network of networks achieved after the convergence of wired and wire- less networks as well as computer, consumer electronics, communication technology, and several other convergences that will be capable of providing 100 Mbps and 1 Gbps, respectively, in outdoor and indoor environments with end-to-end QoS and high security, offering any kind of services anytime, any- where, at affordable cost and one billing.  1.4 Scientific Approach  In order to develop an Adaptive 4G Global-Net  A4GN   see Figure 1.10 , the following six key elements or enabling technologies have been identified:  1. Adaptive and scalable air interfaces; 2. Reconfigurable ambient networks; 3. End-to-end security and QoS; 4. Highly available backbone technologies  e.g., Fiber Ring, MPLS ; 5. User friendly multimedia interfaces and context-aware technologies; 6. Flexible platforms.   14  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  Adaptive 4G Global Net  Adaptive  and  scalable  air  interfaces  Reconfigurable  ambient networks  End to end  security and QoS  Highly available backbone technologies  User friendly  multimedia interfaces and context awareness  Flexible platforms  Figure 1.10 Research umbrella.  For each of the highlighted issues, a more detailed description of the  research to be done is provided in the following sections.  1.4.1 Adaptive and Scalable Air Interfaces  In order to justify the need for a new air interface, target requirements should be set high enough to ensure that the system will be able to serve long into the future. Considering the emerging technologies and the types of services that will need to be provided in the future communication system, a reasonable goal would be to aim for 100-Mbps full mobility wide area coverage and 1 Gbps for low mobility indoor coverage. Currently, the provision of highly reliable wire- less link technologies envisages the use of access technologies  e.g., orthogonal frequency division multiplexing  OFDM  and multi-carrier code division mul- tiple access  MC-CDMA , multiuser modulation, efficient coding schemes, reconfigurable radio, multiple antennas, and adaptive power control. To enable adaptability to network conditions and scalability  in terms of data rate and quality of service , new air interfaces  e.g., 3G+ like high speed downlink packet access, multicarrier and multitone CDMA, ultra-wideband, and optical wireless   Introduction  15  systems  have to be investigated in terms of coexistence with other radio systems, multiple access capability, resistance to interferers, low cost, low power con- sumption, and implementation issues. The research-related areas are shown in Figure 1.11.  1.4.2 Reconfigurable Ambient Networks  To enable the advent of ambient intelligence, the underlying ambient networks need a high degree of reconfigurability. Reconfigurable networks imply the design of new communications mechanisms at different layers. These include research in the areas shown in Figure 1.12.  The reconfiguration actions have an impact on various levels of mobile systems architecture and introduce high complexity that has to be handled by some reconfigurability management intelligence  distributed or not . A possible approach is to start by describing evolutionary scenarios based on existing sys- tems and gradually propose new scenarios deploying leading-edge technologies. Research should start with the definition of user requirements, regulatory demands, system methodology, and constraints. Since reconfigurability con- cepts must be compatible to legacy networks and also be embedded into future IP-based networks and future network topologies  such as ad hoc networks , the support by reconfigurable routers must be ensured.  Results derived from reconfigurable ambient networks and research on intelligent packet transfer techniques may be applied. This may help to identify new higher layer  i.e., above the physical layer  concepts and algorithms to cope  Capacity  enhancements  Spectrum efficiency  enhancements  Cost  Adaptive and scalable air interfaces  100 Mbps-  1 Gbps  Coexistence with other systems  Multiple access  capabilities  Power  constraints  Figure 1.11 Research areas related to the development and validation of new air interfaces.   16  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  Capacity  enhancements  Spectrum efficiency  enhancements  Layered  RRM  Reconfigurable ambient networks  End-to-end  QoS  Handover mechanisms  Access  to services  Protocol adaptation   redesign  Security  Figure 1.12 Research areas related to reconfigurable networks.  in an efficient manner with frequent topology variations, end user requirements, resource availability, and power constraint considerations. To this end, the development and optimization of the above layered and distributed resource management and radio link control algorithms, along with the appropriate middleware, can be conceived. Additionally, methods for spectrum sharing, mode detection, seamless service provision by mode switching, and secure soft- ware download in a combination of classical methods, such as mobile radio design and computer science  a very broad term , may be developed. This cre- ates a synergy platform for novel concepts, which can be combined with a full consideration of the real user needs.  1.4.3 Security Across All Layers  To enable end-to-end security in A4GN, the system will be characterized in terms of:    Availability, which ensures the survivability of network services despite denial of service attack. Authentication, which enables a node to ensure the identity of the peer node that it is communicating with. Confidenti- ality, which ensures that certain information will be never disclosed to unauthorized entities, without proper authentication.   Introduction  17    Integrity, which guarantees that a message is the exact replica of the  original source when it is delivered to the destination.    Authorization, which is the process of deciding if device X is allowed to have access to service Y. It must be mentioned that devices that form ad hoc networks are more exposed to phising, spoofing that leads to fail- ure, and require rugged security measures.    Privacy, which can prevent the information of the users from flowing to  others.    Flexibility, which allows different upper protocols or applications to  enforce their own security policy  Furthermore, novel cryptography algorithms suitable for wireless commu-  nication and low energy implementation should be developed.  1.4.4 Highly Available Backbone Technologies  Wireless systems have to be interconnected using a long-haul backbone network that is IP-based in order to provide global coverage. The network concepts are moving from network-centred towards person-centred solutions, introducing the new network paradigm of WPANs. The idea is illustrated in Figure 1.13.  The main concept is represented by the short-range network solution where the person within his or her personal space can establish connectivity to his or her personal devices and the outer world. The backbone network will be based on optical technology, complemented by a collection of other wired and wireless systems. In this sense, mechanisms for the provision of interoperability  PAN  Access networks  All-IP optical core  GLOBAL  Connected person  Disconnected person  Connected office people  Two people  Figure 1.13 The future Internet.   18  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  between existing and forthcoming wireless infrastructures, with the optical mechanism supporting the IP flows, become mandatory.  Research in this area includes that of  1  mobility mechanisms  to ensure successful interaction among WPANs, the appropriate mechanism must be guaranteed for a dynamic type of communication , and  2  the coexistence of WPANs and other wireless devices based on various standards. This issue should be addressed by evaluating quantitatively the effects of the coexistence model consisting of the following four sections: physical layer models, medium access control  MAC  layer models, radio frequency  RF  channel models, and data traffic models.  An initial approach aims at understanding how different wireless services operating in the same band may affect each other. Later, coexistence mecha- nisms are established. Depending on the operating environment, one mecha- nism may be preferred over the other.  1.4.5 User Friendly Multimedia Interfaces and Context-Aware Technologies  Interfaces like smart cards with biometric capabilities will play an important role in context-aware scenarios. The profile of the user  including not just the net- work parameters but also favorite URLs, e-mail address book, customer bank profile, and so forth  will be saved in smart cards through which the user will transparently interact with the communications infrastructures around him with added security. In parallel, this interface will be used by operators as a bill- ing support and for offering value-added services, depending on location param- eters and profile. Additionally, other ways of interaction based on speech and or gestures, which are defined as multimodal interactive techniques, need to be planned for these scenarios. More research topics for speech, spoken language, and multimedia technologies exist in the context of deployment of hand-held devices that will be used for short or long-range communications.  1.4.6  Flexible Platforms  In order to cope with the broad range of end user requirements in a con- text-aware environment, a flexible architecture has to be designed. Flexible architecture means that, to accommodate a wide spectrum of devices and functionalities in wireless systems, the underlying hardware platforms need a high degree of reconfigurability, including not only field programmable gate array  FPGA  technology, but also mixed architectures based on parallel process- ing, digital signal processing  DSP , ASICs, mixed signal integrated circuit  IC , and hardware IP blocks. An appropriate design flow  including all algorithmic stages up to the system level  should enable the codesign of both various specific devices and flexible high-end multisystem devices. This design flow, to ensure   Introduction  19  flexibility and taking into account various constraints  low power, low cost, low form factor , relies heavily on embedded systems and system-on-a-chip con- cepts. Last but not least, the introduction of multisystem devices is only possible with the help of a high degree of reconfigurable antennas and RF subsystems, as well as of research on new RF architectures  e.g., zero-IF . The different areas of relevance are shown in Figure 1.14.

It goes deeper into the technical difficulties of 4G imple- mentation as well as challenges to achieving 4G. Chapter 2 approaches 4G from a user-centric perspective. This chapter introduces and discusses user needs and trends in order to get a better insight into what user expectations are for future wireless communication systems. Specific and detailed discussions on 4G sce- narios and services are also presented. ITU visions as well as our own vision are presented and discussed. Finally spectrum issues are introduced. The first and foremost challenge has always been to select a suitable access technique for defining and developing any mobile communications generation. The key access techniques based on multicarrier techniques are presented in Chapter 3.  Chapter 4 introduces the key technologies for 4G: MIMO technology, Radio Resource Management, Software Radio Communication System, Mobile IP, and Relaying Techniques.  Major research initiatives focusing on 4G are presented in Chapter 5. These are the Wireless World Research Forum  WWRF , Mobile IT Forum  mITF , Future Technology Universal Radio Environment  FuTURE  project, Next Generation Mobile Communication Forum  NGMC , 4G Research Cooperation Projects in the European Sixth Framework Programme, World- wide Wireless Initiative  WWI , Samsung 4G Forum, and the eMobility Technology Platform.  Chapter 6 explores 4G terminals from the technology and application point of view, in an attempt to identify possible trends, promising technical solutions and challenges for designers of future portable communications equip- ment. The critical success factors for 4G terminals are service convergence, a user-centric interface, and portable intelligence.  Finally, Chapter 7 introduces a fascinating vision of 4G that appears to be the most viable solution for achieving a true knowledge society, as well as for serving users, while at the same time, being attractive to industry, operators, and service providers.

Other important factors like user needs and trends as well as spectrum identifications for 4G will also be discussed. A user-centric approach to 4G is assumed in this chapter.  The deployment of International Mobile Telecommunications-2000  IMT-2000  networks has started in several countries, and high-speed multime- dia services are currently being provided and further developed. However, even at this introductory stage of 3G systems, enhancement activities have already started on a global scale. In fact, for several years already there have been active discussions and exchange of visions about systems beyond IMT-2000, com- monly referred to as the fourth generation, or 4G for short, in various forums and organizations as well as in the open literature. The reasons for this early interest abound. One of the main driving forces for such a development is, with- out a doubt, the unrelenting demand for higher data rates and ubiquitous wire- less access that the planned and foreseen applications and services are expected to generate. Equipment manufactures are in a key position and need to react promptly by developing technically sound and appealing solutions, capable of fulfilling users’ and operators’ expectations, within a common and global  29   30  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  framework. This is a very complex procedure, where key manufacturing players must find a good balance between achieving a mutually convenient technical consensus, interpreting market needs, and imposing industry views. More than ever, academia is greatly contributing by identifying and investigating promising component technologies for future wireless communication systems. Operators and service developers have a huge stake in offering advanced and appealing wireless communication services to their customers, while aiming at profitable operations. Regulators, also at the front of the 4G development scene, control, normalize, and create policies and prosperous environments aiming towards the development of a widely accepted framework. Finally, conveying the voices of all involved parties, prestandardization bodies and discussion forums have a key role in finding a global consensus, as they serve not only as the melting pots of visions but also as the forefront stage for technical debate. Considering the inter- action among the aforementioned key players and taking into account that these diverse contributors do not necessarily share the same interests, goals, and time plans, no one would be surprised to realize that finding a universal definition of 4G is a very elusive task, even after several years of activities and countless attempts in the literature.  2.1.2 Motivation for the Development of a User-Centric View  The number of mobile subscribers worldwide has increased from more than 200 million in 1997 to nearly 950 million in 2001 and 1.8 billion in 2005. Figure 2.1 shows the current global growth of mobile subscribers with some pre- dictions for the near future. Mobile phones are no longer regarded as expensive communication devices only for a minority of users that can afford them. Nowadays, the mobile phone has become an object of necessity and convenience widely used by people of all conditions and age.  Several reasons could account for such an impressive growth. Competition among manufacturers has resulted in substantial price drops in terminals, with affordable models available to all segments of the market. These factors have sig- nificantly contributed to an explosive growth in traffic. On the other hand, peo- ple using wireline broadband Internet are likely to expect similar degrees of data connectivity on the move, with comparable data speeds and quality of service. It could be anticipated that if user expectations for new, useful, and exciting mobile services and applications are matched by the industry with capable and appealing terminals and supporting networks, we can expect a future with even higher numbers of subscribers as well as a steep increase in the amount of data traffic. It is widely accepted that users will expect a more and more dynamic, continuing stream of new applications, capabilities, and services in the future. These services and applications will exploit the fact that terminals will support high data rates, and they will also fully take advantage of other capabilities, like   A User-Centric Approach to 4G: Visions and Foresights  31  Worldwide subscriber and terminal forecast   Unit: Million   Subscriber forecast, CAGR=11%  2,445  2,237  2,032  1,812  1,589  Terminal forecast , CAGR=8.6%  595  645  713  760  827  3,000  2,500  2,000  1,500  1,000  500  0  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008  Source : Strategic Analysis, In-Stat MDR 2004  Figure 2.1 The global growth of mobile subscribers and terminals.

Rather than provide a precise definition of the future 4G wireless commu- nication systems, this chapter attempts to describe an updated overview of the 4G landscape of visions and foresights. Indeed, at this time there is no complete, unique, and widely accepted definition of 4G, but rather a large collection of prospective descriptions, each possibly biased toward the business interests of the defining party. In order to predict properly the 4G era, an objective method- ology is necessary. A scenario-based methodology will be introduced for such a purpose. The present chapter discusses some of the key 4G visions as well as other tightly related factors, chiefly spectrum issues and their close interaction with 4G developments. As an introductory illustration, Figure 2.2 depicts the principal driving forces behind past, current, and future wireless communica- tion systems, with an emphasis on cellular evolution.  This chapter is organized as follows. Section 2.2 introduces and discusses user needs and trends in order to get a better insight into what user expectations on 4G might be. The key driving force justifying or creating the need for devel- oping 4G is service. We will shed some light on the area of future services by considering first a number of likely scenarios for the future, all having as a start- ing point the needs  and trends  of the users.

Visions and foresights of 4G are discussed in Section 2.6 These include discussions on ITU visions and other approaches trying to define 4G. Finally, spectrum issues are discussed in Section 2.7.  2.2 User Needs and Trends  This section emphasizes the importance of the service-driven approach to 4G and briefly discusses user needs and trends from the views of user, market, and technology.  2.2.1 A Service-Driven Approach to 4G  Mobile communication systems have steadily evolved in a relatively short period, spanning mainly the last 25 years. Today, it is widely accepted that ser- vices will be the most important success factor for the telecommunication busi- nesses to come. Therefore, it is anticipated that next generation communication systems will be service-driven and user-centric-service development drives tech- nological development, not the other way around.  Until now, wireless communication systems were developed around a given technology and then the appropriate services were developed for these   A User-Centric Approach to 4G: Visions and Foresights  33  systems. With this bottom-up approach, commercialization success cannot be guaranteed as the services offered match the technical capabilities of the systems but do not necessarily match the expectation of the users. This approach has clearly worked in the second generation  2G  where the basic services were broadly introduced and the level of expectation was nearly fulfilled with voice and text messaging services. The same cannot necessarily be said with the 3G, where the gap between services and user expectations has been difficult to close, since users have been exposed to sophisticated services through wired high-speed Internet connections. As 4G development is taking off, the wireless world is now focusing on an opposite method, a top-down approach, where technology follows services and applications. In order to meet user expectations and hence make of 4G a great technical and commercial achievement, it is paramount to predict what these expectations actually are. Undoubtedly, user behavior and future expectations are very difficult to predict. One cannot rely on linear extrapola- tions based on past patterns, making also the top-down approach somewhat risky. Service development is inherently a formidable task since the services are based upon the user needs. It is commonly agreed that 4G should be developed around the user and that technology is just a means, not the goal of the 4G development. Recently, some authors have approached 4G from such a user-centric perspective [1, 2, 11–14]. The key features that users expect from future 4G systems are obtained from a number of relevant user scenarios  e.g., business on-the-move, smart shopping, mobile tourist guides [2] . In Sections 2.3 and 2.4, a systematic framework for developing scenarios and extracting promising services from these scenarios will be presented. As a basis for develop- ing a systematic framework, future trends need to be extracted first to cater to these user needs. In what follows, a sketch of such user, market, and technology trends is given.  2.2.2 User Needs and Trends  Users will expect new dynamic and flexible applications and services that are ubiquitous and available across a range of devices, possibly using a single sub- scription  or a single identity, number, or address  to access any network. Adapt- able communication systems offering customized and ubiquitous services based on diverse individual needs will require flexibility in the technology in order to satisfy multiple demands simultaneously. To satisfy users, work has already begun on the convergence of telecommunication services such as digital broad- casting and commercial wireless services. Higher data rates will enable new applications and services. High speed capability is important when seen as a sup- porting part of the development, but this capacity is meaningless if there are no services or applications making full use of it. It is thought that most of the users are not automatically appealed to by the speed at which a wireless   34  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  for brand marketing purposes, but  communication device can operate, but most fundamentally by its capacity for performing efficiently important and useful tasks  or applications . The race for developing a new technology with record-breaking data throughputs could be useful to be somehow short-sighted if the goal is to attract customers’ attention. As seen in the Section 2.2.1, it is commonly agreed that 4G should be approached from a user-centric perspective. The procedure for extracting important 4G features likely to be appreciated by the users starts by mapping real-life situations with possible ser- vices that could help to make users’ lives more comfortable and safe. Some com- mon and useful attributes associated with these services, the sought features, are then identified. Important features valued by users are listed below:  it appears    User friendliness: Users are thought to give a top priority to easy-to-use,  simple, and intuitive man-machine interfaces.    User personalization: Flexibility in configuring the terminal, services, and contents according to the preferences of the user is an important asset to create a sense of uniqueness in the user.    Network heterogeneity: Users highly value the ubiquitous provision of connectivity and common services. In terms of future communication systems, the solution to such a requirement would be a network of net- works, the 4G network, that transparently and seamlessly offers contin- uous and pervasive services with provision of QoS.    Terminal heterogeneity: Users will enjoy a large and diverse variety of terminals, from small and simple devices with limited capabilities to high-performance multifeatured ones. The diversity in communication devices and supporting networks can be considered as one the most dis- tinctive characteristics of 4G.  User friendliness is related to terminal design, though services and applica- tions as well as the transparency and performance of the supporting network also play important roles in conferring satisfaction to the user. User personaliza- tion is related to the terminal, services, and applications. There is an inherent mutual synergy between user friendliness and transparency that should be exploited by the manufacturers and service providers to better satisfy future users. Also, network and terminal homogeneity are concepts that support each other naturally.  Figure 2.3 [1] shows the innovation areas introduced by previous, present, and future mobile communication networks as well as the associated open sys- tem interconnection  OSI  layers to these innovations. It is expected that 4G would require innovation across all OSI layers. One can see also that the deci- sion of a user to buy a mobile terminal is chiefly related to what the upper layers   r e y a  l  I S O O S I     7  6  5  4  3  2  1  A User-Centric Approach to 4G: Visions and Foresights  35  Speech Global Mobility Security  Speech Global Mobility Security++  User decision  IMS  4G technology  GSM Network  UTRAN  2G  3G  Generation  4G  Figure 2.3 Innovations in different ISO OSI protocol layers in different mobile communica-  tion generations.  have to offer  e.g., applications and services attainable through the terminal , rather than other obscure aspects  for the user  like physical layer features.  From the viewpoint of market trends, it is an unchanging and everlasting truth that markets always follow the economic costs and profits, no matter how many new high technology solutions are developed. As of today, high-speed data connection is a norm in accessing multimedia and Internet services through wired connections. This is also starting to become true for wireless environ- ments, due to additional spectrum, efficient spectrum utilization, and advanced radio technologies. Services are the driver for the future market and the role of technology is just to enable provision of services and capabilities for which users are willing to pay. Figure 2.4 shows the predicted worldwide revenue for differ- ent 3G services until 2010. By that time services based on data traffic may con- tribute with more than two-thirds of the total service revenues. The global geographical distribution in Figure 2.5 shows that Asia and Europe will enjoy the largest revenue shares in mobile data communications. Today the existing mobile subscriber base is huge, around one-quarter of the world’s population. Such an impressive figure speaks by itself in terms of potential for an explosive growth in traffic.  Even though 4G is approached from a user-centric perspective, rapidly changing technology trends need to be taken into account when developing future scenarios. Technology-wise, in the ITU-R M.1645 recommendation [3], technologies and trends are related and the key examples are provided in five   36  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  Worldwide revenues - all services  Simple voice Rich voice Location-based services Mobile Internet access Multimedia messaging service Mobile Internet extranet access Customized infotainment  2009 Figure 2.4 Global revenues from mobile voice and data communications  only 3G .  2002  2008  2007  2004  2003  2001  2006  2005  2010  categories:  1  system-related technologies,  2  access network and radio inter- face,  3  utilization of spectrum,  4  mobile terminals, and  5  applications. Taking into consideration the above trends as a starting point, future trends shown in Table 2.1 were obtained by using a well-known expert agreement approach  a.k.a. Delphi method .

As an intermediate step to new service develop- ment we will focus first on scenario development. In Section 2.4 we will concen- trate on developing 4G scenarios. In Section 2.5 we will develop some service concepts for the proposed scenarios. Authors in [4] suggest three different ways for scenario development: normative, inductive, and deductive. The normative and inductive methods start from a participant’s assumptions on the future soci- ety, but the results can be biased towards participants’ preconceptions. On the other hand, the deductive method starts from the concrete facts, eliminating the participants’ preconceived ideas as much as possible, which is why many of the existing documents have been adopting it. Readers are referred to [4] for more detail on normative and inductive methods. We summarize our framework as shown in Figure 2.6.  2.3.1 Scenario Development  Instead of vague and abstract questions like, “What will society look like in the year 2010?” we would like to ask a more concrete and specific question: “What   38  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  Brainstorming used only in this stage  Scenario development  New service development  Factor  Trend  Key trend  Scenario Image  Exiting service classification  Use case development  New service extraction  Figure 2.6 Scenario and service development methods  deductive .  will the mobile device in 2010 look like?” or “What kind of killer applications will mobile devices offer in 2010?” These allow us to stay more focused.   1  Factors  A. Identification: Participants brainstorm to identify various factors that may influence an answer to the question. We will call discrete factors that remain undivided “factors.” We believe that any system- atic framework needs at least one phase where it needs participants’ input, and it should be the first stage of the entire process. From then on, the process should be executed in a relatively automatic and objective way from the first stage on. Thus, our framework starts with a brainstorming section as in other similar work. Unlike others, however, our framework does not rely as heavily on brain- storming or common wisdom after the first brainstorming.  B. Classification: The list of factors will have much duplication and will include similar or overlapping ideas because of the nature of brain- storming, which encourages free and unobstructed thought. In order to facilitate the removal of duplication or overlaps, we first classify the factors.  C. Evaluation: We evaluate how important each factor is by using the  Delphi method [5].   2  Trends  A. Identification: We group the factors that have similar impact into clusters  classification of the factors helps here . We call these clus- ters trends. If a factor in a trend drives  prohibit resp.  the trend, we call the trend an activator  inhibitor resp.  of the trend.   A User-Centric Approach to 4G: Visions and Foresights  39  B. Evaluation: We evaluate each trend’s importance and uncertainty based on its activator’s and inhibitor’s importance. We believe that this new method gives more reliable results than directly evaluating a trend’s importance and uncertainty by using the Delphi method, mainly because trends are too big to understand solely by intuition.   3  Key Trends  A. Selecting the scenario logic  matrix : Depending on the number of important and uncertain trends, we can proceed in one of two ways: In the case where we can identify two or three important and i uncertain trends [4]: We set two or three possibilities that each trend may assume. For instance, a trend that “environmentalism will become a major concern,” can have two different possibili- ties, namely, “high” or “low.” It is up to the participants’ judg- ment to allow a third possibility: “somewhere in between.” Then we can construct a matrix that spans all the possible situations  we dub it a scenario quadrant  depending on how each impor- tant and uncertain trend turns out. Then we exclude scenario seeds that seem very unlikely  see Figure 2.7 and Table 2.2 .1  ii In the case that we can identify two or three important and uncertain trends [6]: We set two to five possibilities that each trend may assume. Unlike the case above, we have too many pos- sible combinations. Thus, we choose a few likely scenario seeds and make a judgment on how each important and uncertain trend will turn out.   4  Scenario Images  A. Choosing scenario plots: We select an appropriate plot for each scenario seed. We adopt a pool of stereotypical scenario plots  that is, those that occur again and again throughout the history  from [6]: winner and loser, challenge and response, evolution, and so forth. We characterize each scenario plot by a set of attributes and apply the same set of attributes to each scenario seed. Then we match each scenario seed to a scenario plot that best matches with respect to the attribute sets. We believe that this systematic method gives more reliable and consistent results than selection by common wisdom.  1. Selected trends should be as orthogonal as possible in order to span the whole space of possi- bility in the question. The fact that there is an unfeasible combination of the selected big trends implies that they are not really orthogonal. In that case, we may need to scrutinize the selection process.

B. Drawing overall images: From the scenario seeds and the selected scenario plots, we describe an image of the future, which we dub the overall image.  Table 2.2 shows the selection of the scenario logic. Scenario 1 occurs when Trend 1 takes Possibility 1, Trend 2 takes Possibility 1. Scenarios 2 and 3 occur under the same rule. The possibility that Trend 1 takes Possibility 2 and Trend 2 takes Possibility 1 is very unlikely, so it is deemed unfeasible and will not be considered.

Classifying existing services: We classify existing services gleaned from various sources in terms of a set of attributes and evaluate how promis- ing or suitable each service will be in each overall image.  2. Use case development: Given the overall images, and the promising services, we flesh out scenarios; this method is in sharp contrast to other approaches in the available literature, where scenario creation relies on common wisdom.  3. New services extraction: We derive new promising services for each scenario. In doing so, we believe that the overall image and promising services will help.  2.4 Scenarios  2.4.1  Factors  2.4.2  Trends  Factors, trends, key trends, and scenario images are discussed in the following sections.  Through various documents and recent data we have extracted and classified factors related to future trends from the user, technology, economy, and indus- try standpoints. These results were shown in Table 2.1. By using an expert agreement method, we evaluated the impact of each factor on future society.  Classified factors are clustered suitably. If all the factors in a cluster facilitate spe- cific trends, then those factors in the cluster are the activators of those particular trends. From the importance of factors acquired from the previous step, we acquire the importance of trends as follows: If there are many important activa- tors and important inhibitors and the difference between them is small, then that trend is important and uncertain. These trends become the main axis in deciding the scenarios. On the other hand, if important activators or inhibitors are many and the difference is large, then that trend is important and certain. The other trends are not considered from then on. Table 2.3 shows the list of trends and their activators inhibitors.   42  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  Table 2.3 The Trends  1. Users will become more active. 2. As basic needs are fulfilled, people begin to search for deeper values of life. 3. The craving for personalization will grow. 4. Technology will pervade ubiquitously. 5. Environmentalism will become a major concern. 6. Discrete technologies of the digital divide shall merge towards digital convergence. 7. Globalization shall increase. 8. A technology-abundant society consisting of cyber lives creates a demand for greater security. 9. Value chains will increase in complexity. 10. Global aging of societies shall increase.  2.4.3 Key Trends  The trends can be classified in the following three ways by using the Delphi method: Each expert ranks the trends by importance and uncertainty and their results are aggregated to reach a consensus as shown below  see Figure 2.8 .   1  The two most important and uncertain trends — will be the key  trends. A. User activeness shall increase  user activeness   i. Activator  1. Increase of user activeness on information application  user  role changes from contents consumer to producer ;  2.

The craving for personalization will grow. B. Ubiquity shall pervade in to all technology fields.   3  Other trends will be given or assumed on hold.  2.4.4 Scenario Images  Plots are basically the structure of a scenario or the outline of a large framework. Plots must have clear causality and must not have contradictions overall. The characters in these plots are either driving forces or institutions. The scenarios describe how these driving forces or institutions might behave under different plots or combinations of plots. Reference [6] shows the following stereotypical plots. Note that this is one possible way to classify stereotypical plots, although this approach [6] widely used. Thus, as an example for organizing, classifying, and analyzing scenarios, we consider the following.  1. Winners and losers: Serious complications and secret sympathy is the outlook of the world. More than just what I want, it is important to know what opposes me or who opposes my enemies. Basically, this is a zero sum plotline where the strong survive and the weak get weaker.  2. Challenge and response: Conquer difficulties and make technological  or political breakthroughs.  3. Evolution: Gradual changes, forecast based on past trends. When considering technical advancement, a technology map is important, especially technology advances that affect human life.  From the scenario seeds extracted from the previous stage we choose suit- able scenario plots, based on which we picture overall images of the society  see Figure 2.8 .   44  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  Value of life  Well-being  Natural symphony  A Piece for everyone  Consumer  User activeness  Prosumer  Current state  Up for grabs  Figure 2.8 Scenario dimensions.  Economic sensitivity  Natural Symphony Key phases: ubiquitous network, value of life.  This scenario shows a society where constituents are well connected via ubiquitous network. Users pursue their lives with the full assistance of various mobile services, which provide push service to users, automatically recognizing users’ needs.  Market. In this ubiquity society, there exists competition among different business areas such as mobile operators, broadcasting operators, and access net- work providers, but this is very reasonable competition within a few dominant market leaders that shows no threats of cartel. Big moguls with affiliated compa- nies like mobile operators, service providers, and access network providers could offer seamless and personalized services with qualified levels to users.  Society. This society is very comfortable and peaceful with a low crime rate. Due to ubiquitous technologies, many things  e.g., security  that people had to worry about are resolved. After that, people have a greater interest in health, travel, and so on, which speaks to valuable lives. As the personalized push service becomes more universal, individualism is more and more apparent in this society.  A Piece for Everyone Key phases: Community, diversification.   A User-Centric Approach to 4G: Visions and Foresights  45  This scenario shows society as it gradually changes in time without any great turbulence. The users in this society are very active and consider personal happiness very important. DIY-like activity is quite common with full automa- tion or ubiquity partially deployed. Because of user activity patterns, unlicensed spectrum usage is very high and research on spectral efficiency is highly motivated.  Market. Business fields such as services, access networks, and network management are run independently of each other, and the network architecture takes the form of open networks. Personalized services are not enough for the active users, which makes them prosumers, making the access network more important than services. Due to the extensive amount of networks, convergence has only been partially realized.  Society. As people become more active in the pursuit of personal happi- ness, society becomes an enormous set of unique communities according to hobbies and interests. Communities are very specialized and detailed in all fields, but due to their heterogeneity they lack commonality between them.  Up for Grabs Key phases: It is economics stupid, merciless jungle, winner and loser.  This scenario implies that society evolves extremely biased to capitalistic economy values and everyone seeks to accumulate economic wealth, neglecting other values of life. Most enterprises only provide uniform products and services in order to satisfy similar user needs.  Market. User demand will concentrate on specific services and products related to economical behavior. Users may always evaluate services and products in search of cost-effective methods to use or produce valuable information. Sim- ple information providers may lose their market power since most users actively collect information by themselves to produce economic values. On the other hand, access network service market will grow and industrial structure of access network service market may converge to oligopoly due to the large investment necessary to construct a core network. But, due to such high competition, any access network provider cannot become a dominant market power.  Society. Economic value is most important to most members of society. Most members may neglect noneconomical behavior such as human relations and the dilettante life; hence, a person or organization will be judged according to the economical value of his outcome. This extreme capitalism will cause noticeable distinction between the rich and the poor. Population will crowd towards downtown and the outskirts. Workers will usually go to work by mass transportation.  In this section we have shown that by following a reasonable and rational analysis it is possible to identify key scenarios that will serve as a starting point to develop appropriate services and applications.   46  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  2.5 Services  After considering users and identifying promising scenarios in previous sections, in this section we move on to discuss services for future wireless communication systems. Services cannot be developed in isolation; they need to be conceived around specific scenarios. We first start with a classification of existing services in Section 2.5.1. Then, in Section 2.5.2 we concentrate on service extraction.  2.5.1  Existing Services Classification  We examine each service presented in various sources in terms of a set of attrib- utes and determine whether each service is suitable or promising in the three overall images  See Table 2.4 .  2.5.2 New Services Extraction  We extract new services from the use cases we developed in the previous stage. Figure 2.9 corresponds with Natural Symphony. Figure 2.10 corresponds with A Piece for Everyone. Figure 2.11 corresponds with Up for Grabs.  We have shown how our framework makes full use of participants and produces cascading results that eventually lead to complete scenarios. Our framework leverages participants’ input gleaned at the beginning; it then utilizes and leverages it to the full extent throughout the entire process. In our view, this framework outperforms the existing ones with respect to efficiency, consistency, and reliability.  We believe, although it is still to be verified, that our framework can be a basis for developing new services; our framework provides an evaluator that determines how promising a proposed service is in a particular scenario. Thus, we may be able to develop a new service and constantly test it using the evalua- tor, which would make the new service more solid and profitable. WWRF [16] and mITF [15]  see Chapter 5  have also developed scenarios and services in an attempt to justify the development of future wireless communication systems. Surprisingly, one can find several similar concepts and proposals for future services.  2.6 Visions and Foresights  In this section we move on from the previously discussed user-scenario-service chain, and approach 4G from a more technical perspective. We first review the ITU vision of future wireless communication systems, considered here as our baseline reference. Next, we describe and discuss some common approaches to 4G, trying to identify some commonalities and differences.

Follow-me service   54  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  to foresee 4G, we present our own views. In addition to the user trends previ- ously discussed, other important developments and tendencies could help us to better approach, define, and justify future 4G networks. Trends in various cate- gories of Table 2.1 support the argument of an explosive increase in the demand of bandwidth required to realize a truly wireless knowledge society. Current wire- less systems like 3G fit very well in this picture, but only as one constituent part. Present systems cannot by themselves offer enough network capacity, link capa- bilities, and coverage for supporting a vision of a highly connected world fully exploiting broadband communications. Moreover, the bandwidth required for that purpose is far beyond the figures in use today, and hence, a new spectrum allocation is necessary. The vision of a highly connected world, where virtually every entity  users and machines  can communicate to each other in any possible situation, anytime, exploiting broadband capabilities, is truly appealing, and equally important, fits very well in the aforementioned logical chain.  2.6.1  ITU Vision  The ITU-R Working Party 8F  WP8F  is responsible for the overall system aspects of IMT-2000 and beyond. The ITU developed the 4G vision not only for internal ITU work but also for external organizations in order to provide an official and unbiased overview of 4G for related industries, the global research community, and other interested parties. Note that ITU uses the terminology “beyond IMT-2000" rather than 4G.  The WP8F believes that the IMT-2000  in its present state , along with further enhancements to the IMT-2000 like new mobile access and nomadic local area wireless access elements, should be considered to be a system as a whole. to consider backward compatibility and interoperability. The ITU high-level framework describes this point clearly, as follows:  important  It  is    Enhanced IMT-2000 systems should support a steady and continuous evolution of new applications, products, and services through improve- ments in data rates and enhancements to the existing IMT-2000 radio interfaces.    A framework for systems beyond IMT-2000 should be realized by the functional fusion of existing, enhanced, and newly developed elements of new mobile access, nomadic local wireless, and so forth, with high commonality and seamless interworking.  This concise definition of 4G is in agreement with the definition given in Chapter 1. We stress again the fact that ITU in principle identifies 4G as a   A User-Centric Approach to 4G: Visions and Foresights  55  system having a functional fusion of existing  legacy  systems, enhanced systems, and new capabilities with a new spectrum-though it does not establish if a new spectrum is required or not. The ITU focuses more on developing a new system rather than considering the fusion of legacy systems. Concrete standardization may commence once spectrum has been identified, presently assumed to be at the world radiocommunication conference  WRC-07 , with a period of research and investigations required prior to this meeting. In order to successfully pro- vide broadband wireless connectivity to the expected large number of 4G users and new bandwidth-hungry services, it is likely that additional and or new spec- trum must be identified. A more detailed process for spectrum identification in WRC-07 is described in Section 2.7.  Figure 2.12, developed in WP8F and sometimes referred to as the van dia- gram, shows the capabilities of 4G, illustrating the various components and their relationships to each other.  The capability of future 4G systems can be expressed into three parts;  1. Future development of the IMT-2000. There will be a steady and con- tinuous evolution of the IMT-2000 to support new applications, products, and services. For example, the capabilities of some of the IMT-2000 terrestrial radio interfaces are already being extended up to 10 Mbps and it is anticipated that these will be extended even further up to approximately 30 Mbps by 2005, under optimum signal and traffic conditions.  2. New capabilities of systems beyond IMT-2000. For systems beyond IMT-2000, there may be a requirement for a new wireless access tech- nology for the terrestrial component-expected around 2010 and after. This will complement the enhanced IMT-2000 systems and the other radio systems. ITU as well as key telecom manufacturers predict that by 2010 potential new radio interface s  should support data rates of up to approximately 100 Mbps for high mobility such as mobile access and up to approximately 1 Gbps low mobility such as nomadic local wireless access. These data rate figures and their associ- ated mobility should be seen as the targets for research and investiga- tion of the basic technologies necessary to implement the framework. Note that 100 Mbps and 1 Gbps refer to overall cell throughput in wide and local access, respectively. Future system specifications and designs will be based on the results of the research and investigations. Due to the predicted data rate requirements, additional spectrum will be needed in order to deliver the new capabilities of systems beyond IMT-2000. The data rate figures anticipate the advances in technol- ogy, and these values are expected to be technologically feasible in the time frame noted above. It is possible that upstream  uplink  and  for   56  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  Systems beyond IMT-2000 will encompass the capabilities of previous systems  Mobility  New mobile access  IMT-2000  Enhanced IMT-2000  Enhancement  High  Low  New capabilities of systems beyond IMT-2000  Dashed line indicates that the exact data rates associated with systems beyond IMT-2000 are not yet determined  New nomadic local area wireless access  1  10  100  1000  Peak useful data rate  Mbit s   Denotes interconnection between systems via networks, which allows flexible use in any environment without making users aware of constituent systems Nomadic local area access systems  Digital broadcast systems  Dark shading indicates existing capabilities, medium shading indicates enhancements to IMT-2000, and the lighter shading indicates new capabilities of systems beyond IMT-2000.

Relationship between the IMT-2000 systems, beyond IMT-2000, and other access systems. In conjunction with the future development of IMT-2000 and systems beyond IMT-2000, relationships will con- tinue to develop between different radio access and communication systems; for example, WPANs, WLANs, wireless metropolitan area networks  WMANs , digital broadcast, and fixed wireless access  FWA . As pointed out before, other communication relationships besides person-to-person will emerge, such as machine-to-machine, machine-to-person, and person-to-machine.   A User-Centric Approach to 4G: Visions and Foresights  57  The ITU-T also developed the Recommendation ITU-T Q.1702, enti- tled “Long-Term Vision of Network Aspects of Beyond IMT-2000,” which addresses the envisaged network environment, network design objectives, and architecture concepts of systems beyond IMT-2000. This ITU vision would be the nucleus and guidelines for the development of related research in external organizations as well as within the ITU.  The world today is comprised of mutually exclusive networks, which are now beginning to interwork with each other. In that sense the future can be seen as a convergence of networks. Thus, as it was already mentioned, one can inter- pret 4G systems as a converging platform where heterogeneous networks interoperate in a seamless manner. Moreover, from a broader perspective, the overall composite network can be considered as a network of networks. Such a convergence cannot take place without the concurrent efforts of all involved par- ties. Broad consensus is required across industry. Operators and service provid- ers must be part of the business equation. Universities and other research centers play a key role not by supporting basic investigation but also by actively contrib- uting and generating new concepts and technologies to the field. It has been rec- ognized that 4G development should be carried out around the user, and with the user as the ultimate target. Understanding the user means matching future products and services to the market needs. No one can take 4G for granted; in order to make 4G true and thoroughly pervade our lives, an enormous amount of effort is required to find a global consensus.  2.6.2 Some Approaches to 4G  Several approaches to 4G exist. The simplest ones tend to see 4G as a linear extension of current 3G systems, particularly highlighting, either separately or jointly, the high data rate transfer capabilities and the support of high mobility. This linear vision, to some extent prevalent in Asia, represents a rather narrow vision, serving perhaps the interests of certain sectors, but fails to see 4G as a universal, flexible, ubiquitous, and powerful access solution working in and across a variety of scenarios and supporting a variety of services from a wide range of possible terminals. This linear vision is also rather common in America, where most of the attention seems to focus on the high-speed capabilities of the access schemes, but in this case the focal point is on local access  short-range  systems.  A concurrent vision of 4G, often identified as the European vision, sup- ports the integrative role of 4G as a convergence platform of several networks. In other words, one could think of 4G as a network of heterogeneous networks. The integration of such an eclectic system is achieved at an IP networking layer, where the role of IP is paramount to enable a seamless network operation. An all-IP network  encompassing the access and core networks  is the most straight- forward and effective way to integrate all the possible different networks   58  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  constituting 4G. Regardless of particular views to approach 4G and despite dif- ferences in its definition, developing parties tend to agree on several of the key characteristics of such systems. The features are listed in Table 2.5 [20].  The concurrent  integrative  approach to 4G is very close to the ITU vision considered in Section 2.6.1. From such a perspective, 4G can be under- stood as a mosaic of complementary scenarios and associated access technolo- gies. For each scenario there could be more than one proponent access solution. It is interesting to note that regional schedules to adopt 4G appear to differ con- siderably, with Asia aiming to introduce 4G by 2010, and Europe taking a slower pace, targeting 2015 or even later. It is expected that the introduction of 4G will be carried out initially by realizing the linear vision; namely, systems supporting high-speed communications the possible scenarios  WWAN, WMAN, and WLAN  would be promoted as 4G. Integrating several access technologies, complementary and competing, to realize a harmonious network would be one of the greatest initial challenges of 4G.  in any of  2.6.3  Foreseeing 4G  Present mobile communication systems have evolved by adding more and more system capabilities and enhancements. In the future, and continuing with this trend, users will see a significant increase in capability through the future enhancements of existing 3G systems. As ITU states, future 4G wireless com- munications systems could be realized by functional fusion of existing, enhanced, and newly developed elements of current 3G systems, nomadic wireless access  Table 2.5  Characteristics of 4G Systems  Achievable data rates: 100 Mbps  wide area coverage , 1 Gbps  local area .

This is a generous and flexible definition, truly allowing legacy systems  2G and 3G , their evolutionary development, and new systems to coex- ist, each being a component part of a highly heterogeneous network, the 4G network.  It can be said that future 4G systems are likely to be based on evolutionary and revolutionary technologies, the latter aspect referring to newly developed access concepts. Figure 2.13 depicts the 4G realm as a conjunction of two well-known evolutionary developments, corresponding to the mobile  wide area coverage, cellular  and nomadic  local area coverage, short-range  evolutions in the upper and lower portions of the figure, respectively. From its inception in the 1980s until its current days, wide area cellular mobile communications, characterized by high mobility and low to moderate data rates, have enjoyed a steady growth in terms of achievable throughputs. Every generation of cellular systems  2G, 3G  offered marked improvements with respect to its preceding one. The same applies with the nomadic  local area  access, characterized by low mobility and moderate to high data rates. Between 3G and 4G there is a transi- tional period, sometimes known as B3G, where further enhancements are expected, particularly in the achievable communication speed together with the degree of mobility. As time goes by, one can see that local access systems will tend to acquire more characteristics of wide area systems  e.g., higher mobility  whereas wide area systems will tend to become closer to their nomadic  High Mobility  lower data rates   2G  Mobile  GSM IS-95 IS-136  3G GPRS  EV-DV HSDPA  CDMA1x WCDMA  Nomadic  IEEE802.11 IEEE802.16 Bluetooth  Wi-Fi  Wi-Max  W-PAN  UWB  DMB  B3G  4G realm  Evolution  Revolution  Evolution  Revolution  1  2  WiBro  IEEE802.16e  3  Low mobility  higher data rates   Figure 2.13 Evolution of mobile and nomadic wireless communication systems and their  convergence into the 4G domain.  2005  2010+  Time   60  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  counterparts in terms of data throughputs. It is obvious that the capabilities of 4G have to be higher than those corresponding to any of the present wireless systems, encompassing virtually all possible combinations of mobility and data rate. The shift toward higher data rates may pose challenges to the designers of future systems, in particular when high data throughput connections and mobil- ity are to be supported simultaneously. In addition to the  1  mobile and  2  nomadic development paths  corresponding to WWAN and WLAN develop- ments, respectively , Figure 2.13 also shows a third path plainly aiming to  3  4G, namely through broadband wireless access technology  sometimes identi- fied as WMAN . This third approach has received lately considerable attention and support, and hence, it is also worth taking it into account as a legitimate technology component aiming at 4G. WMAN refers mainly to the develop- ments around the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers  IEEE  802.16 standards. In particular, standard version 802.16e addresses the problem of mobility in mid-size cells  e.g., up to several kilometers  while maintaining relatively high data throughputs  e.g., tens of megabytes per second . In terms of mobility and data transfer capabilities, WMAN can be positioned on a middle way between WWAN and WLAN. Also, from the standpoint of these technical features, we can consider WLAN, WMAN, and WWAN as complementary tech- niques that can coexist and altogether constitute the 4G network. It is likely, however, that evolution and further developments to enhance the most impor- tant features of these networks, conferring wider coverage, more mobility, and higher data throughputs, will result in overlapping capabilities. Obviously, this would lead to scenarios where these three basic component technologies could also be competing. In such cases, it is difficult to forecast how these component technologies could be positioned, as the interaction between manufacturers, operators, and markets is complex. Infrastructure and terminal costs will have a these possibly competing decisive role in determining the final share of approaches. Certainly, other system performance indicators could also make a difference when comparing competing approaches.  As one would expect, telecommunication manufacturers  sometimes referred to as the mobile sector  tend to see 4G more as an evolutionary continu- ation of their current mobile business, and thus putting more emphasis on development falling within the upper right corner of Figure 2.13. Conversely, IT companies  the wireless sector , with background business in local access sys- tems, are more inclined to see 4G as an enhanced extension of such short-range communication systems  the lower right corner in Figure 2.13 . As already men- tioned, mere evolutionary development may not necessarily allow the achieve- ment of some goals, and some new developments could be needed. Academia, regulatory bodies, and other parties with fewer economic ties to the wireless business tend to favor a more unified vision of 4G, supporting equally both wide area and local area approaches.   A User-Centric Approach to 4G: Visions and Foresights  61  At this point it is interesting to point out that though highly widespread, the terminology “4G” is somewhat misleading. Indeed, previous and present generations  1G to 3G  refer chiefly to cellular access, whereas 4G, in its widest sense, refers to a broader domain where cellular is just one of its constituent parts. Due to this and some other strategic reasons, some parties prefer to avoid the use of “4G.” In particular, ITU refers to Beyond IMT-2000 when referring to the next generation of wireless communication systems, as already mentioned.  One can approach 4G from the network coverage standpoint, by looking at how different wireless services were and are being provided at different geograph- ical scales [20], as depicted in Figure 2.14 [2]. One of the tenets mostly associ- ated with 4G is “always connected, everywhere, anytime.” The outcome of such a principle, though highly beneficial to the end user, demands unprecedented efforts on the part of the designers of future wireless communication systems. The apparent simplicity and transparency enjoyed by users of future 4G systems has an enormous price to be paid by manufacturers, standardization bodies, and the research community, in terms of having a network of eclectic networks to appear as a single, simple, and everywhere-reaching network. Figure 2.14 [2] shows the network hierarchy, starting with a distribution layer at the largest scale. This layer provides large geographical coverage with full mobility, although links may convey a chunk of composite information rather than signals from individ- ual subscribers  e.g., broadcast services such as digital audio broadcasting  DAB  and digital video broadcasting  DVB  . Next in the hierarchy is the cellular layer, with typical macro-cells of up to a few tens of kilometers. This network also pro- vides full coverage and full mobility, but now connections are intended to cater to individual users directly.

Note that the cellular layer encompasses both macro and micro-cells. The metropolitan layer or network-of which IEEE 802.16, HyperMAN, and Wireless broadband  WiBro  are typical examples-provides urban coverage with a range of a few kilo- meters at the most, with moderate mobility and moderate data speed capabilities. On a smaller scale and moving towards the local area layer  e.g., indoor networks or short-range communications , the network provides access in a pico-cell, typi- cally not larger than a few hundred meters, to fulfill the high capacity needs of hotspots. Nomadic  local  mobility is supported, as is global roaming. 3G makes use of the cellular layer  typically micro-cells  in combination with hotspots  WLAN , through vertical handovers, to provide coverage in dedicated areas. Next in the wireless network hierarchy is the personal area network  PAN , very-short-range communication links  typically 10m or less  in the immediate vicinity of the user. Within this layer we can also enclose body area networks  BAN  and some other submeter wireless networks. Going back to the paradigm of a pervasive 4G wireless network, in order to effectively have an unlimited reach while being able to support a variety of data rates, 4G would have to embrace all the described network layers; or in other words, 4G could be defined as a conver- gence platform taking in and working across BAN, PAN, LAN, MAN, cellular, and distribution networks.  2.7  4G Spectrum Issues  Spectrum is a crucial matter in the design and manufacture of wireless systems and devices. The characteristics of propagation and technical parameters of the frequency bands may influence or determine requirements of devices for systems operating in the frequency bands and service characteristics such as mobility requirements and coverage. Furthermore, spectrum is a scare resource, and therefore, it should be utilized efficiently. Suitable and affordable frequency bands should be allocated to each wireless system for the purpose of efficient use of spectrum.  On the other hand, to pursue economics of scale in wireless communica- tion systems as well as to promote the fair use of spectrum among countries, global harmonization is a very important factor to determine frequency bands for wireless services; hence, regulatory matters should be considered in the deter- mination of spectrum allocation. This is why any spectrum of wireless services needs to be managed by a global standardization body. The ITU-R plays an important role in allocation identification of wireless services and the WRC supported by the ITU-R is the only entity that can make decisions on the global use of spectrum. All the agreed-upon decisions in the WRC are reflected into the ITU-R Radio Regulation through the Radio Assembly  RA .   A User-Centric Approach to 4G: Visions and Foresights  63  Spectrum allocation and identification by the WRC for wireless services require a considerable amount of research regarding their necessity, spectrum demands, and compatibility  or sharing  with other existing services in their pre- ferred frequency bands. The ITU-R Study Groups are responsible for such research activity. Among the study groups, the ITU-R SG8  8th Study Group  is in charge conducting spectrum-related research for spectrum of mobile ser- vices, whereas the ITU-R WP8F  Working Party 8F  is responsible for the 4G relevant studies.  2.7.1 Background  Research on the 4G spectrum is based on the ITU-R vision framework of future development and systems beyond IMT-2000, which advocates the vision of future mobile systems based on multiple radio access networks incorporated in one core network. Service aspects in terms of mobility and transmission rate have been described in ITU-R Recommendation M.1645. As per the vision of systems beyond IMT-2000 in M.1645, new mobile systems beyond IMT-2000  4G mobile systems  require up to 100 Mbps per link with up to 250 km h of user speed.  required than that already identified for  To meet the technical and service objectives of 4G mobile systems, more spectrum is IMT-2000 and pre-IMT-2000. Therefore, the ITU-R WP8F seeks new spectrum in terms of bandwidth  spectrum amounts , affordable frequency bands, and associated sharing or compatibility problem, based on the decision of the WRC-2003 Res- olution 228  Rev.WRC-03 . The WRC-07 agenda item 1.4 is to consider fre- quency-related matters for the future development of the IMT-2000 and systems beyond IMT-2000, taking into account the results of the ITU-R studies in accordance with Resolution 228. It states the following:  1. Considering the current IMT-2000 standards, the future development of IMT-2000 and systems beyond IMT-2000 described in the ITU-R Recommendation M.1645 and the needs of developing countries in development and implementation of mobile radio communication technology.  2. The ITU-R seeks frequency bands affordable to provide services described in M.1645 as well as spectrum requirements  required bandwidth . It is responsible for sharing compatibility between existing and future mobile services  4G  in the potential frequency bands.  3.  In addition, WRC-03 considered that ITU-R should develop a harmo- nized time frame for common technical, operational, and spectrum-related   64  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  parameters of systems, taking into account relevant IMT-2000 and other experi- ence. With the considerations and notes of WRC-03’s Resolution 228, ITU-R WP8F investigates spectrum matters related to 4G.  2.7.2 Plan and Timeline of Global 4G Spectrum Allocation  The Plan for the 4G spectrum allocation should follow the ITU-R WP8F schedule. The ITU-R WP8F is composed of three major Working Groups  WGs  and each WG is composed of several Sub-WGs.  Spectrum research within the ITU-R WP8F is performed in three separate directions. The first WG studies future markets for 4G. Traffic demands from future market perspectives will greatly influence the amount of spectrum required by 4G. The second WG concentrates on frequency bands and shar- ing compatibility issues regarding spectrum requirements from future market perspectives. Technical and regulatory matters will also be taken into account in association with the possible frequency bands. The third WG focuses on future 4G systems figures. These figures will be represented as spectrum efficiency in each radio propagation environment corresponding to cell deployment scenarios such as macro and micro-cell deployment.  Working methods of the ITU-R WP8F pursuing the 4G spectrum are as  follows:  demands.

Figure 2.15 shows the output of the ITU-R WP8F studies and their final  due dates.  All the research on the WRC-07 agenda items within the ITU-R should be finalized before the conference, and normally, the results of the research con- ducted by the ITU-R SGs will be submitted to the Conference Preparatory Meeting  CPM  prior to the conference.

Based on these submitted results, the CPM will prepare CPM texts as input doc- uments of the WRC-07.  2.7.3 Prospective Frequency Bands  Recently, discussions on frequency bands of new mobile aspects of 4G have been held in some global standardization bodies. In particular, the ITU-R WP8F deals with possible frequency bands of the 4G as well as a basic view of   66  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  the 4G spectrum. The basic principles of 4G spectrum allocation within the ITU-R WP8F are as follows. The 4G spectrum should be sufficient to satisfy future market needs around 2010 and after. It should also provide full mobility and full coverage to replace current mobile systems such as pre IMT-2000  2G  and the IMT-2000  3G . A technical overview of the 4G spectrum will outline candidate frequency bands that can meet such requirements. In addition, exist- ing systems should be taken into account in terms of sharing and compatibility with future 4G systems. The ITU-R allocation can provide basic information on which types of services systems can be concerned with the future spectrum of 4G. We now review the ITU-R Radio Regulations regarding global allocation of spectrum.  Technical Aspects of 4G Spectrum Many investigations on frequency bands for new mobile systems beyond IMT-2000 concentrate on frequency bands below 6 GHz. Several technical and regulatory aspects support frequency bands below 6 GHz for mobile systems.  First, mobile systems usually suffer from large Doppler shift as the operat- ing frequencies are increased. In the time domain, large Doppler shift in spec- trum gives smaller coherence time, so that, more frequent fading may occur in a certain transmission interval [7]. A shorter time frame, which causes an increase of overhead in transmission, is desirable to guarantee coherent detection as increase of frequency bands. The effects of Doppler shift on the future mobile systems were studied in [8]. These documents assumed that the frame size is determined in association with coherence time  i.e., frame size is defined as 20% of coherent time and size of overhead in each frame is fixed regardless of frame size . In this assumption, they showed that Doppler shift influences systems per- formance in terms of transmission efficiency and payload ratio during certain time intervals. If the operating frequency is large, the Doppler shift is increased. Thus, frame size should be shortened, thereby increasing the overhead.  Second, path-loss in the transmission also influences system performance and coverage, and hence, system deployment cost. Path-loss is closely related with coverage of mobile systems, and systems characterized by wider coverage work normally in lower path-loss environments. Path-loss has an explicit rela- tion with the frequency bands. As per free-space path-loss law, path-loss without shadowing and multipath fading is inversely proportional to the frequency band. Several studies assessing the path-loss law in practical environments have been conducted. Normally, there are many obstacles that cause more scattering, diffraction, and therefore attenuation in practical environments. But, research at NTT DoCoMo [9, 10] has shown that even in urban environments, path loss without shadowing and multipath fading follows free-space law when increasing the frequency bands. Even though systems operating in low path-loss environ- reuse distances while meeting constant carrier-to- ments  require longer   A User-Centric Approach to 4G: Visions and Foresights  67  interference radio  CIR  requirements, more bandwidth is necessary to meet the same traffic demands in this environment than with higher frequency band environments. From this perspective, technologies that exploit shorter reuse dis- tances are also expected to be important in the future. Lower frequency bands are more appropriate with respect to coverage, reducing eventually system deployment cost; whereas higher frequency bands are more appropriate from the standpoint of spectral efficiency.  As we described above, the appropriate frequencies for future mobile com- munications should be in relatively low frequency bands. To obtain bandwidth sufficient enough to support services with very high data rates, frequency bands for future mobile networks need to be above frequency bands allocated for IMT-2000-that is, above 2.7 GHz. At this point in time, there is no conclusive technical evidence on what the upper frequency limit for the band should be. However, 6 GHz appears to enjoy support among the active members of ITU working on spectrum identification and planning. Thus, as of today, frequency in the band from 2.7 to 6 GHz could be regarded as one of the most promising frequency bands for future mobile communication systems.  Regulatory Aspects of 4G Spectrum To identify regulatory aspects of the 4G spectrum, we first review the global allocation of the spectrum below 6 GHz. The mobile spectrum below 6 GHz is mainly allocated not only to mobile services including pre-IMT-2000  2G  and the IMT-2000  3G  services but also to fixed services such as point-to-point or point-to-multipoint transmission. Broadcasting and broadcasting auxiliary ser- vices also use 1-GHz frequency bands extensively. Outside broadcasting nor- mally uses 2- and 3-GHz frequency bands. The lower part of the ultrahigh frequency  UHF  band is allocated for other kinds of mobile services such as the Private Mobile Radio  PMR  Trunked Radio Services  TRS . The terrestrial trunked radio  TETRA  and integrated digital enhanced network  iDEN  sys- tems are being operated in these bands. Table 2.6 shows mobile allocations in the ITU-R radio regulation of the UHF band.  Some concerns on lower parts of the UHF band, below 800 MHz, have been discussed within the ITU-R WP8F regarding positions of developing countries. As per the description of technical aspects, lower frequency can make systems provide larger coverage. In developing countries, this characteristic reduces the deployment cost of mobile system with full coverage; hence, they prefer these bands for new allocation of the IMT-2000 and systems beyond IMT-2000.  Table 2.6 implies that many parts of the UHF band have already been allo- cated to mobile services and that most of the allocated bands are currently used or planned to be used by mobile systems including 2G and 3G mobile services. Additional identification of 4G systems in the bands allocated to mobile service   68  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  Global Allocations for Mobile Services in the UHF Band  Table 2.6  Frequency Bands  ITU-R Allocations  406-430 MHz  440-470 MHz  740-806 MHz 806-960 MHz  1,710-2,025 MHz 2,110-2,200 MHz  2,300-2,400 MHz 2,400-2,500 MHz 2,500-2,690 MHz  Mobile, fixed Europe: PMR U.S.: PMRS Mobile, fixed Radio location  440-450 MHz  Radio sonade  460-470 MHz  Mobile, broadcasting Mobile  IMT-2000 additional bands  Mobile  IMT-2000 additional bands  IMT-2000 core bands  1,885-2,025 MHz and 2,110-2,200 MHz  Mobile, fixed Mobile  ISM bands  Mobile, fixed, satellite  BSS: 2,605-2,655 MHz, MSS: 2,500-2,520 and 2,670-2,690 MHz   Operating Mobile Systems  Current and Future   TRS including TETRA, iDEN  Cellular  NMT450 , TRS including TETRA, iDEN  No current mobile services Cellular including CDMA  IS-95, 1x , GSM TRS including TETRA, iDEN PCS1900, GSM 1800, IMT-2000 including FDD, TDD, and satellite component, DECT  Europe, 1,880-1,900 MHz   WiBro  Korea , TDS-CDMA  China  IEEE 802.11b g, Bluetooth IMT-20002  among the UHF band seems to be a rather unachievable task. Besides, other parts of the UHF band are used by other important services such azs aeronautical mobile operations, radio location, space research, and conventional broadcast radio. Allocation of mobile services into such frequency bands is impossible because the existing services in that band would be prone to be affected by  2. The bands 2,500 to 2,690 MHz were identified as IMT-2000 additional bands by the WRC-2000, and use of the bands has been discussed within the ITU-R WP8F to developglobally harmonized frequency arrangements of the IMT-2000 systems. Most of the countries in the European Committee have determined that these bands be used by the IMT-2000 from 2008. The United States FCC has also announced the decision to use these bands in June 2004, and they will allow commercial mobile services including the IMT-2000 in the bands.   A User-Centric Approach to 4G: Visions and Foresights  69  interference from mobile services. Therefore, it can be concluded that the UHF band is not appropriate for mobile services with regard to regulatory aspect.  Regarding those two aspects of the 4G spectrum, affordable frequency bands can hereby be concluded as the 3- to 6-GHz band. Current allocation of the 3- to 6-GHz band is shown in Table 2.7.  Candidate Frequency Band and Global Research Activities Spectrum allocation identification of new systems will be globally determined based on technical research and regulatory aspects. New identification can have a significant influence on the wireless communication industry and other key factions; thus, it should meet the needs of as many private and public organiza- tions as possible. Common understanding and views on the 4G services are the primary assumption for achieving globally harmonized frequency bands for the future 4G communication systems.

Spectrum for 4G should be identified based on following principles:    Regarding technical aspects, frequency bands for 4G will be lower than  6 GHz.    Regarding regulatory aspects, frequency bands for 4G will be higher than current identified bands for mobile services  i.e., 2.7-GHz bands .  4. Mobile use of these bands is identified by WRC-03 with regard to devices that emit only low  level emission.  5. Use of WLAN in the bands 5,150 to 5250 MHz is restricted to indoor transmission with maximum effective isotropic radiated power  EIRP  of 200 mW 20 MHz, but use of WLAN in the bands 5,250 to 5,350 and 5,470 to 5,725 MHz are allowed for outdoor transmission with maximum EIRP of 1W 20 MHz.   A User-Centric Approach to 4G: Visions and Foresights  71    Regarding regulatory aspects, frequency bands for 4G will be among the bands that have already been allocated to mobile services. New allo- cation of mobile services is not allowed according to the WRC-03 Res- olution 228.    Regarding the needs of developing countries, lower frequency bands than those currently identified for mobile services will be used  i.e., below 800 MHz can be examined .  The bands 3,400 to 4,200 MHz and 4,400 to 4,990 MHz are possible fre- quency bands for 4G in consideration of the above statements. Also, the 2,300- to 2400-MHz band, already identified by mobile services in some countries such as WiBro  Korea  and time division synchronous CDMA  TDS-CDMA   China , can be a candidate for several countries. The 5-GHz band is appropri- ate from the technical standpoint, but it has many restrictions of emission due to protection of existing services such as radio location  Radar  and Earth explora- tion satellite; hence, a cellular type of service in that band does not seem to be possible.  Such candidate frequency bands will be discussed within the ITU-R WP8F. Recently, the WP8F distributed a detailed survey document to each administration to examine current mobile services and possible frequency bands identified as spectrum for 4G. Decisions on candidate frequency bands will be associated with spectrum requirements for the 4G  i.e., bandwidth .  Spectrum assignment and regulation methods are also discussed in the World Wireless Research Forum  WWRF . A white paper on spectrum for 4G includes not only the future spectrum allocation overview but also novel meth- ods and technologies to use the 4G spectrum efficiently.  2.8 Conclusions  In this chapter we have approached 4G from a user-centric perspective. We started this journey discussing and analyzing the user, particularly his her needs and expectations. A framework aimed at developing new services, taking as a starting point the user, was developed. As an intermediate step to new service development, we focused first on scenario development. Then, various services for each identified scenario were proposed and analysed. The current huge sub- scriber base and the forecasts that show further dramatic growth can be seen as an optimistic initial condition that will pave the way to a sound foundation for 4G. This is a key prerequisite but it does not guarantee the success of 4G. In our view this success depends first on the ability of service providers to develop use- ful, appealing, scalable  to different terminals , and flexible services. It also depends on the operator pricing policies. Fair fees, simple-to-calculate prices,   72  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  and attractively low fares seem to be conditions that will have a strong influence on the initial acceptance and further development of 4G services. This is true in particular when 4G systems are thought to exploit a plethora of advanced multi- media-based services on a variety of possible terminals, with different types of service qualities involved  e.g., depending on terminal size and or user selec- tion , and from different providers. As important as the above items is the role of technology and how it would support the services. We think that 4G is highly justified from a user-centric view, as long as the aforementioned conditions are met. Technology-wise, we consider the open 4G vision of ITU as a suitable model for approaching and further developing 4G. Its importance lies in the fact that it attempts to integrate several developments into one common platform. These developments correspond to present and future realizations of several net- works based on different access techniques. This concurrent approach gives equal opportunities to the main parties involved  namely telecom and IT manu- facturers  for developing 4G technologies, particularly WWAN, WMAN, and WLAN access solutions. We saw that these three developing paths of constitu- ent technologies are targeting 4G, and eventually each of these approaches will be an integral part of 4G. These solutions can be regarded as complementary and will altogether cover the whole range of radio scenarios. At the time 4G is launched, each of the mentioned developments will encompass legacy systems, enhanced versions of these systems, and possibly other solutions based on new technologies. It is expected that some overlapping of the capabilities of the con- stituent technology will occur, and hence, in addition to coexisting, the different access schemes will also compete. The vision of 4G as a monolithic, ubiquitous network of heterogeneous networks supporting a wide range of terminals with different capabilities and a variety of eclectic services is truly fascinating. Realiz- ing this vision will require an enormous amount of effort from the involved par- ties, not only to develop the 4G component technologies but also to guarantee transparent and seamless operation in and between any possible scenarios, with any type of terminal, and exploiting any kind of available service.

At the moment we are struggling to find a solution to this challenge for 4G [1–6].  Figure 3.1 shows the history and evolution of access techniques over the generations of mobile communications systems. In the discussion about 2G sys- tems in 1980s, there were two candidates for the radio access technique: the time division multiple access  TDMA  and code division multiple access  CDMA  schemes. The TDMA scheme was eventually adopted as the standard. In the discussion of 3G systems in 1990s, there were also two candidates: the CDMA scheme that was not adopted in the older systems and the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing  OFDM -based multiple access scheme called band division multiple access  BDMA  [7]. CDMA was adopted as the stan- dard. If history is repeated—that is, if the access technique that was once not adopted can become a standard in a new generation system—OFDM-based technique looks to be promising as a 4G standard.  The following list provides some of our justifications:  1. Multicarrier techniques can combat hostile frequency selective fading encountered in mobile communications. The robustness against fre- quency selective fading is very attractive especially for high-speed data transmission [8].  75   76  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  OFDM  born in 1960   CDMA  CDM  born in 1940s   TDM  MIMO-SCM  born in 1990   ?

The OFDM scheme has been well matured through research and development for high rate wireless LANs and terrestrial digital video broadcasting. A great deal of know-how has been developed on OFDM.  3. By combining OFDM with CDMA, we can have synergistic effects, such as enhancement of robustness against frequency selective fading and high scalability in possible data transmission rate.  respectively, multicarrier  Figure 3.2 shows the advantages of multicarrier techniques.

Thus, the multiple access protocol is defined as the agreement and set of rules among users for successful transmission of information using a common medium. Whenever some resource is used and thus accessed by more than one independent user, the need for a multiple access protocol arises. In the absence of such a protocol, conflicts occur if more than one user tries to access the resource at the same time. Therefore, the multiple access protocol should avoid or at least resolve these conflicts. Thus, a multiple access technique is defined as a function sharing a  limited  common transmission resource among  distributed  ter- minals in a network.  The multiple access protocols addressed in this chapter are those used in communication systems in which the resource to be shared is the communica- tion channel. In this case, the reason for sharing the resource is mainly the con- nectivity environment. In wireless communication systems, an added reason is the scarceness of radio resource; there is only one ether [1]. When, instead of a common medium with an access for every user, there is a network that consists of point-to-point links  different medium , but one of these links is simulta- neously shared by many users, the multiplexing technique is needed. Multiplexing is the transmission of different information in the same physical link. Table 3.1 shows the difference between multiple access and multiplexing. The design of a protocol is usually accomplished with a specific goal  envi- ronment  in mind, and the properties of the protocol are mainly determined by the design goal. But if we rule out the environment-specific properties, we can still address a number of properties that any good multiple access protocol should possess:   78  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  Difference Between Multiple Access and Multiplexing  Table 3.1  Multiple Access  Multiplexing  Resource Terminal connectivity Switching  Possible  Topologies  Control  Network Matrix Yes  ≤ 3   OSI: open systems interconnection  Bus Star Ring Tree Central Distributed  Link Point-to- multi point No  OSI ≤ 2   Path s   Terminal    The first and foremost task of the multiple access protocols addressed here is to share the common transmission channel among the users in the system. To do this, the protocol must control the way in which the users access  transmit onto  the channel by requiring that the users con- form to certain rules. The protocol controls the allocation of channel capacity to the users.    It should perform the allocation such that the transmission medium is used efficiently. Efficiency is usually measured in terms of channel throughput and the delay of the transmissions.    The allocation should be fair toward individual users; that is, it should not take into account any priorities that might be assigned to the users—each user should  on the average  receive the same allocated capacity.    The protocol should be flexible in allowing different types of traffic   e.g., voice and data .    It should be stable. This means that if the system is in equilibrium, an increase in load should move the system to a new equilibrium point. With an unstable protocol an increase in load will force the system to continue to drift to even higher load and lower throughput.    The protocol should be robust with respect to equipment failure and changing conditions. If one user does not operate correctly, this should affect the performance of the rest of the system as little as possible.   Multiple Access Techniques  79  In this chapter, the wireless mobile environment is what we are most inter- ested in. In such an environment, we can be more specific about some of the pro- tocol properties, especially on the robustness with respect to changing conditions. In the wireless mobile environment, the protocol should be able to deal with:    The hidden terminal problem: two terminals are out of range  hidden from  of each other by a hill, a building, or some physical obstacle opaque to UHF signals, but both are within the range of the central or base station;    The near-far effect: transmissions from distant users are more attenu-  ated than transmissions from users close by;    The effects of multipath fading and shadowing experienced in radio  channels;    The effects of cochannel interference in cellular wireless systems caused  by the use of the same frequency band in different cells.  Many of the protocol properties mentioned above are conflicting, and a trade-off has to be made during the protocol design. The trade-off depends on the environment and the specific use for the protocol one has in mind.  3.2.1 Classification of Multiple Access Protocol  Starting in 1970 with the ALOHA protocol, a number of multiple access proto- cols have been developed. Numerous ways have been suggested to divide these protocols into groups [1, 2, 9, 10]. In this chapter, multiple access protocols are classified into three main groups  see Figure 3.3 : the contentionless protocols, the contention protocols, and the hanging protocols.  The contentionless  or scheduling  protocols avoid the situation in which two or more users access the channel at the same time by scheduling the trans- missions of the users. This is either done in a fixed fashion where each user is allocated part of the transmission capacity, or in a demand-assigned fashion where the scheduling only takes place between the users that have something to transmit.  With the contention  or random access  protocols, a user cannot be sure that a transmission will not collide because other users may be transmitting  accessing the channel  at the same time. Therefore, these protocols need to resolve conflicts if they occur.  The contention protocols are further subdivided into repeated random protocols and random protocols with reservation. In the latter, the initial trans- mission of a user uses a random access method to get access to the channel. However, once the user accesses the channel, further transmissions of that user   80  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  Multiple access protocols  Contentionless  scheduling   Contention   random access   Hanging   swimming   Demand assigned  Coding concept  Subcarrier concept  Repeated  random access  Random access  with reservation  Fixed  assigned  FDMA TDMA  Polling token passing  CDMA  OFDMA  ALOHA, s-ALOHA  Implicit Explicit  Figure 3.3 Classification of the multiple access protocols.  are scheduled until the user has nothing more to transmit. Two major types of protocols are known as implicit and explicit reservations. Explicit reservation protocols use a short reservation packet to request transmission at scheduled times. Implicit reservation protocols are designed without the use of any reservation packet.  The hanging  or swimming  protocols do not belong to either the contentionless or the contention protocols. They fall between the two groups. In principle, it is a contentionless protocol where a number of users are allowed to transmit simultaneously without conflict. However, if the number of simulta- neously transmitting users rises above a threshold, contention occurs.  The hanging protocols are subdivided into techniques based on coding and subcarrier concepts. The hanging protocols are achieved either by assigning unique code to each user or by providing each user with a fraction of the avail- able number of subcarriers. With hanging protocols forming a separate group and taking into account the subgroups of the contentionless and contention protocols, we end up with six categories.  3.2.1.1 Contentionless  Scheduling  Multiple Access Protocols The contentionless multiple access protocols avoid the situation in which multi- ple users try to access the same channel at the same time by scheduling the trans- missions of all users. The users transmit in an orderly scheduled manner so every transmission will be a successful one. The scheduling can take two forms:   Multiple Access Techniques  81  1. Fixed assignment scheduling. With these types of protocols, the avail- able channel capacity is divided among the users such that each user is allocated a fixed part of the capacity, independent of its activity. The division is done in time or frequency. The time division results in the TDMA protocol, where transmission time is divided into frames and each user is assigned a fixed part of each frame, not overlapping with parts assigned to other users. TDMA is illustrated in Figure 3.4 a . The frequency division results in the frequency division multiple access  FDMA  protocol, where the channel bandwidth is divided into nonoverlapping frequency bands and each user is assigned a fixed band. Figure 3.4 b  illustrates FDMA.  2. Demand assignment scheduling. A user is only allowed to transmit if he she is active  if he she has something to transmit . Thus, the active  or ready  users transmit in an orderly scheduled manner. Within the demand assignment scheduling, we distinguish between centralized control and distributed control. With centralized control, a single entity schedules the transmissions. An example of such a protocol is the roll-call polling protocol. With distributed control, all users are involved in the scheduling process and such a protocol is the token-passing protocol.  3.2.1.2 Contention  Random  Multiple Access Protocols With contention multiple access protocols there is no scheduling of transmis- sions. This means that a user getting ready to transmit does not have exact knowledge of when it can transmit without interfering with the transmissions of  f  f  TDMA   a   Figure 3.4  a  TDMA and  b  FDMA.  t  t  FDMA   b    82  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  other users. The user may or may not know of any ongoing transmissions  by sensing the channel , but it has no exact knowledge about other ready users. Thus, if several ready users start their transmissions more or less at the same time, all of the transmissions may fail. This possible transmission failure makes the occurrence of a successful transmission a more or less random process. The random access protocol should resolve the contention that occurs when several users transmit simultaneously.  We subdivide contention multiple access protocols into two groups: the repeated random access protocols [e.g., pure  p -ALOHA, slotted  s -ALOHA, carrier sense multiple access  CSMA , ISMA , and random access protocols with reservation [e.g., reservation  r -ALOHA, packet reservation multiple access  PRMA ]. With the former protocols, every transmission a user makes is as described above. With every transmission there is a possibility of contention. With the latter protocols, only in its first transmission does a user not know how to avoid collisions with other users. However, once a user has successfully com- pleted its first transmission  once the user has access to the channel , future transmissions of that user will be scheduled in an orderly fashion so that no con- tention can occur. Thus, after a successful transmission, part of the channel capacity is allocated to the user, and other users will refrain from using that capacity. The user loses its allocated capacity if, for some time, it has nothing to transmit.  3.2.1.3 Hanging  Swimming  Multiple Access Protocols The hanging multiple access protocols are subdivided into coding-based proto- cols  CDMA protocols  and subcarrier-based protocols  OFDMA .  CDMA Protocols This section deals with the class of CDMA protocols, which rely on coding to achieve their multiple access property. The basic principles of CDMA protocols are discussed and placement of the protocols between the contentionless  sched- uling  and contention  random access  protocols is explained.  CDMA protocols do not achieve their multiple access property by a divi- sion of the transmissions of different users in either time or frequency, but instead make a division by assigning each user a different code  Figure 3.5 . This code is used to transform a user’s signal into a wideband signal  spread-spectrum signal . If a receiver receives multiple wideband signals, it uses the code assigned to a particular user to transform the wideband signal received from that user back to the original signal. During this process, the desired signal power is com- pressed into the original signal bandwidth, while the wideband signals of the other users remain wideband signals and appear as noise when compared with the desired signal.

As long as the number of interfering users is not too large, the sig- nal-to-noise ratio  SNR  is large enough to extract the desired signal without error. Thus, the protocol behaves as a contentionless protocol. However, if the number of users rises above a certain limit, the interference becomes too large for the desired signal to be extracted and contention occurs, making the protocol interference limited. Therefore, the protocol is basically contentionless unless too many users access the channel at the same time. This is why we place CDMA protocols between contentionless and contention protocols.  There are several ways to classify CDMA schemes. The most common is the division based on the modulation method used to obtain the wideband sig- nal. This division leads to three types of CDMA: direct sequence  DS , frequency hopping  FH , and time hopping  TH , as illustrated in Figure 3.6[1]. In DS-CDMA, spectrum is spread by multiplying the information signal with a pseudo-noise sequence, resulting in a wideband signal. In the frequency hopping spread spectrum, a pseudo-noise sequence defines the instantaneous transmission frequency. The bandwidth at each moment is small, but the total bandwidth over, say, a symbol period is large. Frequency hopping can either be fast  several   84  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  hops over one symbol  or slow  several symbols transmitted during one hop . In the time hopping spread spectrum, a pseudo-noise sequence defines the transmis- sion moment. Furthermore, combinations of these techniques are possible. In this chapter we focus on DS-CDMA because it is the technique used for third generation wideband CDMA proposals. Wideband CDMA is defined as a direct sequence spread spectrum multiple access scheme where the information is spread over a bandwidth of approximately 5 MHz or more.  OFDMA Protocols OFDM, a special form of multicarrier modulation, isused as multiple access schemes in wireless communications. In OFDM, densely spaced subcarriers with overlapping spectra are generated using fast Fourier transform  FFT  [3]. Signal waveforms are selected in such a way that the subcarriers maintain their orthogonality despite the spectral overlap. Usually, CDMA or TDMA is used with OFDM to achieve multiple access capability.  Basically, orthogonal frequency resources  i.e., orthogonal subcarriers  can be shared among users, which is the simplest multiple access technique based on OFDM modulation. Besides, there are a number of hybrid multiple access tech- niques that can be found in literature. Here, hybrid means an amalgamation of OFDM and multiple access techniques  with the main accent to the spread spectrum  to provide an efficient multiuser scenario with very high data rate. The following techniques will be discussed in this chapter [1–38]:  1. MC-CDMA [3, 5]; 2. OFDMA [3]; 3. OFDM-CDMA-SFH [6]; 4. VSF-OFCDMA [37, 38].  Direct sequence  Frequency hopping  Time hopping  Figure 3.6 Direct sequence, frequency hopping, and time hopping CDMA.   Multiple Access Techniques  85  3.3 MC-CDMA System  The OFDM scheme is insensitive to frequency selective fading, but it has severe disadvantages such as difficulty in subcarrier synchronization and sensitivity to frequency offset and nonlinear amplification; on the other hand, the CDMA scheme has robustness against frequency selective fading. Therefore, any syner- gistic effect might not be expected in combining an OFDM scheme with a CDMA scheme. However, the combination has two major advantages. One is its own capability to lower the symbol rate in each subcarrier enough to have a quasi-synchronous signal reception in uplink. The other is that it can effectively combine the energy of the received signal scattered in the frequency domain. Especially for high-speed transmission cases where a DS-CDMA receiver could see 20 paths in the instantaneous impulse response, a 20-finger Rake combiner would be impossible to implement for the DS-CDMA receiver, whereas an MC-CDMA receiver would be possible although it would lose the energy of the received signal in the guard interval.  The MC-CDMA transmitter spreads the original signal using a given spreading code in the frequency domain. In other words, a fraction of the sym- bol corresponding to a chip of the spreading code is transmitted through a dif- ferent subcarrier. For multicarrier transmission, it is essential to have frequency nonselective fading over each subcarrier. Therefore, if the original symbol rate is high enough to become subject to frequency-selective fading, the signal needs to be serial-to-parallel converted first before being spread over the frequency domain. The basic transmitter structure of MC-CDMA scheme is similar to that of a normal OFDM scheme. The main difference is that the MC-CDMA scheme transmits the same symbol in parallel through many subcarriers, whereas the OFDM scheme transmits different symbols.  =  ×  Figure 3.7 a  shows the MC-CDMA transmitter P parallel data sequences  aj,0 i  , aj,1 i  , …, aj,P–1 i    and then each serial parallel converter output is mul- tiplied with the spreading code with length KMC. All the data in total N P K MC  corresponding to the total number of subcarriers  are modulated in baseband by the inverse discrete Fourier transform  IDFT  and converted back into serial data. The guard interval ∆ is inserted between symbols to avoid intersymbol interference caused by multipath fading, and finally the signal is transmitted after RF up-conversion.

Note that, in  3.1 , no spreading operation is done in the time domain. Equation  3.2  shows that the symbol duration at subcarrier level is P times as long as the original symbol duration because of serial parallel conversion. Although the minimum subcarrier separation is given by  3.3 , the subcarrier separation for aj,p i   is [see the hatched subcarrier power spec- tra in Figure 3.7 b ]. Therefore, when setting KMC to 1, the transmitted wave- form given by  3.1  becomes all the same as an OFDM waveform with P subcarriers.

They are orthogonality restoring combining  ORM , equal gain combining  EGC , maximal ratio combining  MRC , and minimum mean square error combining  MMSEC . The techniques are discussed in [3, 5, 6].  3.3.1 MC-CDMA System Design  To determine the number of subcarriers and the length of guard interval, we derive the autocorrelation function of the received signal. The received signal for the jth user is given by      t  =  r  j MC    t  s  j MC  − ⊗  τ     h  jg     τ ;    t d  τ  +      n t   3.10   +∞∫  −∞    j τ; t     h  where with L received paths and{ }τ  l  is the complex equivalent low-pass time-variant impulse response  ≤ τ 0 l ∆ ≤ τ  ≤ ∆ ≤  T  s  l  is classified as follows:     l    L 1 K ,  K , +  = =  +  1 ,  1 ,  L  L  L  l  1  1     =  2        L  The Fourier coefficient of the 9th  q = mP + p  subcarrier at t  given by [see Figure 3.7 c ]   3.11   =  ′ is  iT s   89   3.12    3.13   Multiple Access Techniques     r  j q , MC  iT  s    ′ =  1 ′−  ∆  T  s  iT  ∆ j MC  s  T  ∫  ′ + ′ − s r ′ s  iT      t e  −  ∆π q f  j  2    ′ − t  i  ′   Ts dt  The normalized autocorrelation function of the qth subcarrier between ′and  for the j th user is written as    i  =  −  t  ′    T s 1  iT s  =  t     R  , j q MC  ∆  ,  ′ , N R f  ,  τ  ,  D  RMS     =       − i   ∗ j q , MC  ]     ′ T 1 ]   ′  s  iT  s  [ E r       ′ ⋅ ∗ , , j q j q iT r [ MC s MC     ′ ⋅ j q , E r iT r MC σ 2 S + σ  +  σ  s  1 2 I  2 n  =  σ  2 S  2  where σ  2 , σ  S 1  2 , σ Ι  2 , and σ 2  S 2  n are given in [3].  In an OFDM scheme, generally, when the transmission rate,  ′R ,  in the case of MC-CDMA scheme  is given, the transmission performance becomes more sensitive to time-selective fading as the number of subcarriers N increases, because the longer symbol duration means an increase in the amplitude and phase variation during a symbol, causing an increased level of inter-carrier inter- face  ICI . As N decreases, the modulation becomes more robust to fading in time, but it becomes more vulnerable to delay spread, as the ratio of delay spread and symbol duration increases  see Figure 3.8 . The latter is not necessarily true if the guard time is kept at a fixed value, but as the symbol duration decreases, a fixed guard interval  ∆  means an increased loss of power  see Figure 3.9 . Therefore, for given R  R  , fD, and τ RMS , there exists an optimum that mini- mizes the bit error rate  BER  in both N and ∆ [13].  In the MC-CDMA scheme, Nopt and ∆opt maximize the autocorrelation function  ACF  given by  3.13 , because it means a measure to show how much the received signal is distorted in the time-frequency, selective fading channel  i.e., how we can place the signal on the time-frequency plane so that it suffers from minimum distortion? : ]  ′ , R N R f  arg max  }    {  [   3.14   ∆  ∆     N  =  τ  ,  ,  ,  j  D  RMS  opt  opt  Therefore, with  3.14 , we determine two parameters, Nopt and ∆opt.  3.3.2 Summary  Considering the results presented in [3, 5, 6] for the downlink channel, we can conclude that it could be difficult for a DS-CDMA receiver to employ all the received signal energy scattered in the time domain, whereas an MC-CDMA   90  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  More distortion due to frequency selective fading  Decreasing the number of subcarriers  i  i−1  q−1 q  q 1+  Increasing the number of subcarriers  Time  Frequency  Time  Frequency  Time  More distortion due to time selective  fast  fading  random FM noise   Frequency  Figure 3.8 Optimum in the number of subcarriers.  receiver can effectively combine all the received signal energy scattered in the fre- quency domain. A DS-CDMA receiver needs to make efforts to select larger paths; on the other hand, an MC-CDMA receiver does not care about where the received signal energy is. This is a significant advantage of the MC-CDMA scheme over a DS-CDMA scheme, and it makes the MMSEC-based MC-CDMA a promising access scheme in a downlink channel.  In uplink [3], the MMSEC performs well only for the single user case, otherwise it performs poorly. This is because the code orthogonality among users is totally distorted by the instantaneous frequency response. Therefore, in the uplink application, a multiuser detection scheme is required, which jointly detects the signals to mitigate the nonorthogonal properties [20]. There are many other detectors reported in the literature [21, 22].

In this section, a variation on this theme is described, namely orthogonal frequency division multiple access. In OFDMA, multiple access is realized by providing each user with a fraction of the available number of subcarriers. In this way, it is equal to ordinary FDMA; however, OFDMA avoids the relatively large guard bands that are necessary in FDMA to separate different users. An example of an OFDMA time-frequency grid is shown in Figure 3.10, where seven users  a to g  each use a certain frac- tion—which may be different for each user—of the available subcarriers. This particular example in fact is a mixture of OFDMA and TDMA, because each   92  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  c  c  y c n e u q e r F  a  a  a  a  b  b  b  b  d  d  e  e  e  e  f  f  g  g  g  g  a  a  a  a  b  b  b  b  c  c  c  c  a  a  a  a  b  b  b  b  g  g  g  g  d  d  e  e  e  e  f  f  Time  d  d  e  e  e  e  f  f  g  g  g  g  Figure 3.10 Example of the time-frequency grid with seven OFDMA users  a to g , all of  which have a fixed set of subcarriers every four time slots.  user only transmits in one out of every four time slots, which may contain one or several OFDM symbols.  3.4.1  Frequency Hopping OFDMA  In the previous example of OFDMA, every user had a fixed set of subcarriers. It is a relatively easy change to allow hopping of the subcarriers per time slot, as depicted in Figure 3.11. Allowing hopping with different hopping patterns for each user actually transforms the OFDMA system in a frequency hopping CDMA system. This has the benefit of increased frequency diversity, because each user uses all of the available bandwidth, as well as the interference averaging benefit that is common for all CDMA variants. By using forward error correc- tion  FEC  coding over multiple hops, the system can correct for subcarriers in deep fades or subcarriers that are interfered by other users. Because the interfer- ence and fading characteristics change for every hop, the system performance depends on the average received signal power and interference, rather than on the worst case fading and interference power.  A major advantage of  frequency hopping CDMA systems over direct-sequence or multicarrier CDMA systems is that it is relatively easy to eliminate intracell interference by using orthogonal hopping patterns within a cell. An example of such an orthogonal hopping set is depicted in Figure 3.12. For N subcarriers, it is always possible to construct N orthogonal hopping   Multiple Access Techniques  93  a  b  y c n e u q e r F  c  b  a  b  c  c  a  Time  c  b  a  Figure 3.11 Example of the time-frequency grid with three hopping users  a, b, and c , which  all have one hop every four time slots.  patterns. Some useful construction rules for generating hopping patterns can be found in [23].  3.4.2 Differences Between OFDMA and MC-CDMA  The main difference between OFDMA and the MC-CDMA techniques is that users within the same cell use a distinct set of subcarriers, while in MC-CDMA, all users use all subcarriers simultaneously. To distinguish different users,  y c n e u q e r F  a  b  c  d  e  f  f  a  b  c  d  e  c  d  e  f  a  b  b  c  d  e  f  a  d  e  f  a  b  c  e  f  a  b  c  d  Time  Figure 3.12 Example of six orthogonal hopping patterns with six different hopping  frequencies.   94  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  orthogonal or near-orthogonal spreading codes are used in MC-CDMA. Because of code distortion by multipath fading channels, however, MC-CDMA loses its orthogonality in the uplink even for a single cell. This makes rather complicated equalization techniques necessary, which introduce a loss in SNR performance and diminish the complexity advantage of OFDM over single-car- rier techniques. OFDMA does not have this disadvantage, because in a single cell, all users have different subcarriers, thereby eliminating the possibility of intersymbol or intercarrier interference. Hence, OFDMA does not suffer from intracell interference, provided that the effects of frequency and timing offsets between users are kept at a sufficiently low level. This is a major advantage of OFDMA compared with MC-CDMA and DS-CDMA, because in those sys- tems, intracell interference is the main source of interference. A typical ratio of intracell and intercell interference is 0.55 [24]. Because the system capacity is inversely proportional to the total amount of interference power, a capacity gain of 2.8 can be achieved by eliminating all intracell interference, so that is the maximum capacity gain of OFDMA over DS-CDMA and MC-CDMA networks.  The main advantages of using CDMA in general or MC-CDMA in partic- ular is interference averaging. In CDMA, the interference consists of a much larger number of interfering signals than the interference in a non-CDMA sys- tem. Each interfering signal is subject to independent fading, caused by shadow- ing and multipath effects. For both the CDMA and the non-CDMA system, an outage occurs when the total interference power  after despreading for the CDMA system  exceeds some maximum value. In a non-CDMA system, the interference usually consists of a single or a few cochannel interferers. Because of fading, the interference power is fluctuating over a large range, so a large fading margin has to be taken into account, which reduces system capacity. In a CDMA system, the interference is a sum of a large number of interfering signals. Because all these signals fade independently, the fluctuation in the total interfer- ence power is much less than the power fluctuation of a single interfering signal. Hence, in a CDMA system the fading margin can be significantly smaller than the margin for a non-CDMA system. This improvement in margin largely determines the capacity gain of a CDMA system.  In OFDMA, interference averaging is obtained by having different hop- ping patterns within each cell. The hopping sequences are constructed in such a way that two users in different cells interfere with each other only during a small fraction of all hops. In a heavily loaded system, many hops will interfere, but the interference will be different for each hop. Hence, by FEC across several hops, the OFDMA performance will be limited by the average amount of interference rather than the worst-case interference. An additional advantage of OFDMA over DS-CDMA and MC-CDMA is that there are some relatively simple ways to reduce the amount of intercell interference. For instance, the receiver can   Multiple Access Techniques  95  estimate the signal quality of each hop and use this information to give heavily interfered hops a lower weight in the decoding process.  Another important feature of CDMA is the possibility of performing soft handover by transmitting two signals from different base stations simulta- neously on the same channel to one mobile terminal. Combining the signals from different base stations gives a diversity gain that significantly reduces the fading margin, because the probability that two base stations are in a fade is much smaller than the probability that one base station is in a fade. Less fading means that less power has to be transmitted, and hence less interference is gener- ated, which gives an improvement in the capacity of the system. A nice feature of CDMA soft handover is that it has no impact on the complexity of the mobile terminal; as far as the mobile terminal is concerned, the overlapping sig- nals of different base stations have the same effect as overlapping signals caused by multipath propagation.  For OFDMA systems, two basic soft handover methods exist, applicable to both the uplink and the downlink: base station-to-mobile and mobile-to-base station . A requirement for both methods is that the transmissions from and to the base stations are synchronized such that the delay differences at the two base stations are well within the guard time of the OFDM symbols.  The first technique is to use the same set of subcarriers and the same hop- ping sequence in two cells to connect to two base stations. Hence, in the downlink the mobile receives a sum of two signals with identical data content. The mobile is not able to distinguish between the two base stations; the effect of soft handover is similar to that of adding extra multipath components, increas- ing the diversity gain. This type of soft handover is similar to soft handover in DS-CDMA networks.  The second way for soft handoff is to use different sets of subcarriers in two cells. In contrast to the first method, in the downlink the mobile has to dis- tinguish now between the two base stations. It has to demodulate the signals from the two base stations separately, after which they can be combined, prefer- ably by using maximal ratio combining. This type of soft handover is similar to the one that could be used in a non-CDMA network.  Advantages of the second method over the first—in the downlink—are an increased SNR gain because of receiver diversity, and more freedom for the base stations to allocate available subcarriers. In the first method, base stations are forced to use the same subcarriers. A main advantage of the first method is its simpler implementation: no additional hardware is needed, only some extra pro- tocol features to connect to two base stations simultaneously. The second method does require extra hardware, because it has to demodulate an extra set of subcarriers. Furthermore, it has to perform extra processing for the maximal ratio combining of the signals from the different base stations.   96  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  3.4.3 Discussions  OFDMA is a very flexible multiple access scheme. In combination with fre- quency hopping, it offers all the benefits of direct-sequence CDMA or multicarrier CDMA systems, with the following additional advantages:    OFDMA can achieve a larger system capacity because it is not affected by intracell interference, which is the dominant source of interference in DS-CDMA and MC-CDMA.    OFDMA is flexible in terms of the required bandwidth; it can easily be scaled to fit in a certain available piece of spectrum simply by changing the number of used subcarriers. DS-CDMA and MC-CDMA require a fixed and relatively large chunk of spectrum because of the fixed spread-spectrum chip rate.    OFDMA seems more suited than DS-CDMA and MC-CDMA for support of large data rates. When the data rates per user become larger, the spreading gain becomes lower, so the performance of a CDMA sys- tem converges to that of a nonspread system. In that case, OFDMA with dynamic channel allocation instead of frequency hopping makes more sense than multicode DS-CDMA or MC-CDMA.  3.5 OFDM-CDMA-SFH  Hybrid   This is a new approach [6, 29–35]. In this case  Figure 3.13 , suppose we have an 8-bit CDMA signal  “word” . We feed this word to a serial parallel  S P  converter. After this step comes a crucial difference. We do not carry out any Walsh spreading, but we straightaway carry out an 8-point inverse fast Fourier transform  IFFT   OFDM modulation . This means that one OFDM symbol equals the entire 8-bit CDMA “word” that we need to transmit. Hence, our information rate is eight times faster than in the previous two procedures. At the receiver, we carry out an FFT, but with another crucial difference in that we do not use RAKE combiners. There is no need in our case to use RAKE combiners, since we are not carrying out Walsh spreading in the frequency domain, in the interests of frequency diversity. On the contrary, we will accept the risk that some subcarriers will be in deep fade and correct for this eventuality using FEC coding  coded OFDM  and or from the OFDM-CDMA approach, wherein RAKE combiners are used after OFDM demodulation in order to take advantage of the entire frequency spread of that particular bit. In reality, if we use a N-point OFDM system, we will need to use a N finger RAKE combiner. This is extremely costly, and a compromise can be achieved by using a lesser number of fingers  e.g., a seven finger combiner. This  interleaving. This  is different   Multiple Access Techniques  97  OFDM-CDMA-SFH  Hybrid   P  S  OFDM transmission  Time  Hopping  next user frame   Figure 3.13 OFDM-CDMA-SFH  Hybrid  approach.  Frequency  means that we do not take advantage of the entire frequency spread anyway. In a way, this is a waste of resources. Therefore, after FFT we carry out a paral- lel serial  P S  conversion and then despread the CDMA signal. For user separa- tion, we can use Walsh spreading in the transmitter. But this is done before the S P converter in the transmitter  i.e., in the time domain .  In the receiver we despread the Walsh signal after the P S converter. This will ensure the user separation. There are other spin-offs from this technique and these are discussed later in this chapter. Finally, in the frequency-time dia- gram, we have shown slow frequency hopping of the entire symbol.  This proposal pertains to the downlink as well as to the uplink, the only difference being that for the synchronous downlink we can apply orthogonal Walsh-Hadamard sequences leading to the well-known user separation for MC-CDMA systems. On the other hand, in the asynchronous uplink scenario, pseudo-noise-sequences are used with the drawback of high multiple access interference  MAI .  The overall concept discussed so far is shown in the schematic in Figure  3.14.  3.5.1 Description  It can be seen in the schematic that the transmitter and receiver are each divided into three sections:   98  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  Data modulation section  Walsh spreading  Binary input data  Coding  Interleaving  QAM mapping  Data scrambling  Pilot insertion  SFH section  DAC  G11  Guard interval insertion and windowing  RF Tx  Parallel to serial  IFFT Tx   OFDM section  Serial to parallel  Frequency synthesizer  Frequency hopped signal  Code clock  PN code generator  Hybrid transmitter  SFH section  Dehopped section  Symbol timing  RF Rx  ADC  Synch.

Multiple Access Techniques  99    Data modulation  demodulation  section;   DS-CDMA section;   SFH section.  The binary input data enters the data modulation section, where it is encoded by a FEC code. We can also use concatenated coding comprising a convolutional coding as an inner code followed by an outer coding as a block code  e.g., a Reed-Solomon code  [3]. This makes for a large coding gain with less implementation complexity as compared to a single code. This coding is fol- lowed by interleaving to randomize the occurrence of bit errors due to deep fades across certain subcarriers. This is followed by QAM mapping. Thereafter, the data enters the DS-CDMA section. In this section, the data is subjected to scrambling based on pseudonoise sequences. This aspect is similar to the imple- mentation for the IS-95 system. Thereafter, Walsh coding is used to provide orthogonal covering, because pseudonoise sequences by themselves are insuffi- cient to ensure user separation. The Walsh function matrix will be a N×N matrix, where N is the number of OFDM points. We then obtain what we can call a DS-CDMA signal. We insert pilot symbols after this step. In doing so, we must take care as regards the size of the Walsh matrix. For example, if our OFDM system has 32 points, we can have at most a 24 length Walsh sequence. This leaves eight subcarriers for pilots. This is assuming that we utilize all the subcarriers. In practice, this is not possible, because we need to leave the edge subcarriers unutilized. This problem is explained as follows. We need to allow for the skirt of the low-pass antialiasing filter in the receiver. Subcarriers that lie beyond the bandwidth of interest should contain zero information. This is because it is these subcarriers that will lie along the slope of the low pass filter. If they contained information then their amplitudes will not be uniform since they lie along the slope. It will be recalled that the fundamental assumption for orthogonality between subcarriers is that they have constant amplitude, but dif- fer only in phase. Hence, if any subcarrier of interest lies along the slope of the low pass filter, we will have ICI. Therefore, we need to allow a safety zone, as it were, around each frame by inserting zeros to subcarriers around the edges of the OFDM symbol. During this process, we must ensure that all the subcarriers of interest lie within the pass band of the low pass filter. Furthermore, the commu- nication spectrum is crowded. This means that no extraneous signal should exist beyond the pass band of the filter  i.e., along the slope . The zeros ensure this. The data sequence is then given to the OFDM section. This section is self-explanatory. One point to be noted here is that each user in the DS-CDMA section will share the entire lot of subcarriers with other users. The discrimina- tion between users will only be possible in the DS-CDMA section of the receiver after descrambling and will be based on the orthogonality of the pseudonoise   100  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  sequences and the Walsh coding. The analog signal coming from the digi- tal-to-analog converter  DAC  is then frequency hopped in the SFH section, before being fed to the RF transmitter. The hop set for each user usually bears a definite relationship with the pseudonoise sequence of a particular user. During this process, it must be ensured that:    The frequency synthesizer of the hopper and the carrier beat frequency  oscillator of the RF transmitter are phase locked;    The frequency synthesizer of the dehopper and the beat frequency oscil- lator of the receiver  whose operating frequency is controlled by the synchronization circuit  are also phase locked.  Failure to ensure these two aspects will result in ICI. The hybrid receiver is exactly the reverse operation. The dehopped signal is given to the analog-to-dig- ital converter  ADC , and thereafter, the digital signal processing starts with a training phase to determine the symbol timing and frequency offset. An FFT is used to demodulate all the subcarriers. The output of the OFDM section is the DS-CDMA sequence, which is the DS-CDMA section is the QAM sequence, which are mapped onto binary values and decoded to produce binary output data. In order to successfully map the QAM values onto binary values, first the reference phases and amplitudes of all subcarriers have to be acquired. Alternatively, differential techniques can be applied.  then descrambled. The output of  3.5.2 Observations and Discussions  A detailed treatment of hybrid systems is given [6]. We make the following observations:  1. The MC-CDMA system, whether it is implemented as OFDM  CDMA system or in any other manner, is extremely complex, as it involves spreading each bit across the available bandwidth. Our approach, on the other hand, spreads the entire word before the serial-to-parallel converter, thereby avoiding the complication of single bit spreading as is done in MC-CDMA systems. This means that we spread in the time domain, whereas MC-CDMA systems spread in the frequency domain to achieve the same final result. The MC-CDMA system, moreover, cannot cater to SFH to reduce near-far effect, because in such a case the system will become even more complex. In our approach, on the other hand, this can easily be done. Hence, we choose to call our approach the Hybrid OFDM CDMA SFH approach   Multiple Access Techniques  101  or Hybrid approach for short. This approach has not been suggested before and it was first presented in the ACTS summit of 1999.  2. The advantage of the Hybrid approach lies in its easy implementation as compared to MC-CDMA, since the hardware complexity is less. This aspect has been examined in [6].  3. The problems of synchronization are transferred from the CDMA to the OFDM modulator. It is expected that it will be easier to solve the synchronization of the OFDM modulator as compared to a CDMA modulator, because the former uses cyclic prefixes, which can be exploited to achieve synchronization.  4. This proposal pertains to the downlink as well as to the uplink, the only difference being that for the synchronous downlink we can apply orthogonal Walsh-Hadamard sequences leading to the well-known user separation for MC-CDMA systems. On the other hand, in the asynchronous uplink scenario, pseudo-noise-sequences are used with the drawback of high MAI.  5. Table 3.2 summarizes the overall system aspects.  3.6 VSF-OFCDM  In this section, the variable spreading factor–orthogonal frequency and code division multiplexing scheme proposed by NTT DoCoMo is considered. VSF-OFCDM is designed specifically for the downlink, aiming at providing optimum link capacity for both isolated cell and multicell environments. In gen- eral, it can be seen as an adaptive MC-CDMA scheme, where the spreading fac- tor  SF  is adapted on the basis of the cell environment and the propagation properties. In VSF-OFCDM, spreading is performed in both time and fre- quency domain across OFDM symbols and subcarriers, respectively. This is referred to as the time-frequency localized  TFL  spreading, or 2D-spreading, technique [36]. VSF-OFCDM is considered as a modulation scheme and not a multiple access scheme, because spreading codes are introduced mainly to achieve robustness against multicell interference rather than to provide multiple access.  As a result, it must be employed in conjunction with a multiple access  scheme, such as TDMA, FDMA, CDMA, or a combination of these schemes.  The aim of this section is to highlight the main differences between VSF-OFCDM and the MC-CDMA discussed in Section 3.3, as well as to dis- cuss the adaptation of spreading configuration to various link conditions. Therefore, the remainder of the section is structured as follows. First, the leading to the two-dimensional  spreading procedure will be explained,   102  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  Table 3.2  Hybrid System Overall Aspects  Problem  Solution  1.

But DS-SFH mostly supports noncoherent modulation owing to hopping at bit level. However, coherent modulation is pos- sible, but maintaining phase coherence be- tween hops is difficult.  5. CDMA systems cannot indefinitely support mul- tiple users due to MAI and SI problems caused by too many users.  6. CDMA poses synchronization problems at very  high chip rates.  We use OFDM CDMA, which supports multiple users. OFDM counters this by S P conversion, allowing flat fading at subcarrier level.  The OFDM-FH system hops on frame basis allowing coherent modulation.  The hybrid system allows any number of users by increasing the number of hops. Hence, Number of Users = Number per CDMA System ´ Number of Hops. Bandwidth should, however, be available. OFDM systems have an easier synchronization problem due to using cyclic prefixes.  transceiver structure of VSF-OFCDM. Then, with a starting point in different cell environments, a discussion of the selection of spreading factor will follow. This part will be backed by some of the results obtained in [37, 38]. Finally, the main conclusions will be drawn.  3.6.1  Two-Dimensional Spreading Procedure  Figure 3.15 illustrates the spreading principles:  a  frequency domain spreading,  b  time domain spreading, and  c  time-frequency localized spreading, all with the same spreading factor SF = SFtime × SFfreq = 8.  The frequency domain spreading corresponds to the MC-CDMA scheme, where data is spread by a specific sequence and transmitted on SFfreq parallel subcarriers. The time domain spreading corresponds to the MC-DS-CDMA scheme, where data is spread by a specific sequence and transmitted on a fixed subcarrier over SFtime consecutive OFDM symbols. Ideally, when using orthogonal codes, the transmitted symbols can be perfectly recovered using   Multiple Access Techniques  103  th s OFDM symbol  y c n e u q e r F  q e r f  F S  y c n e u q e r F  r e i r r a c - b u s  h t  k  Time   a   Time  SFtime  b   y c n e u q e r F  q e r f  F S  Time  SFtime   c   Figure 3.15  a  Frequency domain spreading;  b  time domain spreading; and  c  time-fre-  quency localized spreading.

However, in practice the code orthogonality is destroyed to some extent because the indi- vidual chips are scaled differently by the channel due to frequency selectivity and or Doppler effect. This causes undesired intercede interference and finally leads the well-known term MAI will be used to denote intercode interference. The idea behind the time-frequency localized spreading  2D-spreading  is to utilize the fact that the channel may be locally approximated as flat fading  i.e., the channel is correlated in time and frequency  [35]. Therefore, localizing the spreading in time and frequency will cut down the difference in scaling of the individual chips and hence reduce MAI. In VSF-OFCDM, the two-dimensional spreading factor values are adaptively controlled according to the radio link conditions. The selection criteria are discussed in Section 3.6.3.   104  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  3.6.2  Transceiver Architecture  structure  transceiver  employing VSF-OFCDM modulation with The two-dimensional spreading is shown in Figure 3.16. At the transmitter  a , the incoming bits are first encoded, interleaved, and modulated into a sequence of data symbols. Then the data symbols are multiplied by a spreading code. The resulting chips are fed to a block shaper that assigns the chips to SFfreq selected subcarriers at SFtime successive OFDM symbols, depending on the setting of the variable SF controller. At the receiver the relevant chips are extracted from different OFDM symbols by the block deshaper. After despreading, the esti- mated data symbol sequence is demodulated, deinterleaved, and decoded. Anal- ogous to MC-CDMA, different despreading operations such as EGC, MRC, or MMSEC may be utilized.  3.6.3 Spreading Configuration  In VSF-OFCDM the spreading factor controller of Figure 3.15 is adaptively configured. The configuration relies on several link condition parameters, namely, the intercell interference, the delay spread, and Doppler frequency, as  Figure 3.16  a  Transmitter and  b  receiver.   Multiple Access Techniques  105  well as on the major link parameters such as the data modulation scheme and coding rate [38].  3.6.3.1 Dependency on Intercell Interference The key objective of VSF-OFCDM is to be able to operate efficiently in both isolated cell and multicell environments, which is fulfilled by adjusting the spreading factor configuration. In single-cell scenarios, such as hotspot areas or indoor offices, VSF-OFCDM employs SF = 1  thus, OFDM  or a low SF value to avoid the potential MAI problem due to frequency selective fading or Doppler effect. On the other hand, in scenarios where intercell interference is present, a higher SF value is desirable as it introduces robustness against the intercell interference. The choice of SF value, in these cases, is a trade-off between reducing intercell interference and increasing MAI to achieve optimum link capacity [37].  By  the  codes  applying  spreading  for multicell  environments, VSF-OFCDM allows the one-cell frequency reuse scheme to be employed  see Figure 3.17 . With the one-cell frequency reuse model, each cell uses the entire system bandwidth B and transmits using the same carrier frequency  fc  . In [37], a link capacity comparison for multicell environments was made between VSF-OFCDM employing one-cell frequency reuse and OFDM with three-cell frequency reuse.  For the three-cell frequency reuse model, each cell utilizes only one-third of the system bandwidth  i.e., B 3, and hence a total of three carrier frequencies are available for all cells . As a result, it is possible to create a cell structure where no adjacent cells use the same carrier frequency. This is the reason why intercell interference is weak in the three-cell reuse model and no spreading is required. The study shows that VSF-OFCDM with one-cell frequency reuse can achieve a link capacity gain of approximately 1.4 times compared to the OFDM with three-cell frequency reuse. In VSF-OFCDM the system load  i.e., the number of multiplexed codes in relation to the SF-value  is limited due to the increase of MAI. This explains the gain of only 1.4 times associated with a bandwidth gain of 3 times.  3.6.3.2 Dependency on the Link Parameters The spreading factor also depends on the propagation characteristics—namely, the delay spread and Doppler spread of the channel—and on the other link parameters, such as modulation scheme and coding rate. When the wireless channel is more correlated in time than in frequency, it is suggested to priori- tize time spreading [38]. This allows the time spreading to be applied without being penalized by MAI, especially for isolated cell environment, where the user mobility is low. Therefore, time spreading can be introduced in both iso- lated cell and multicell environments to facilitate specific features. For instance,   106  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  fc   a   fc fc  fc fc  fc fc  fc fc  fc fc  fc fc  fc fc   b   fc fc  fc fc  fc fc  fc fc  fc fc  fc fc  fc fc   c   bandwidth pr.

However, if the degree of orthogonality destruction in the time domain is significant due to high mobil- ity, the spreading factor controller shall decide to spread less in the time domain [38].  At the cell border, when the intercell interference is strong, and when a low constellation modulation and a low channel coding rate is utilized, it is desirable to employ frequency domain spreading along with time domain spreading and interleaving. In this case the MAI increase due to the fre- quency domain spreading is insignificant as compared to the frequency diver- sity gain [38].  3.6.4 Summary  The VSF-OFCDM modulation scheme is originally based on MC-CDMA with an adaptive spreading factor extension. It has been further extended to support time domain spreading and is thus flexible in the spreading shape spanning from the general two-dimensional TFL spreading, through the one-dimensional fre- quency or time spreading  MC-CDMA or MC-DS-CDMA , to the special no-spreading case corresponding to normal OFDM.

For multiple access support, the scheme may be employed with several standard methods such as TDMA, FDMA  through subcarriers , CDMA, or combinations of these.  3.7 Conclusions  This chapter provided a summary of leading multiple access techniques and their classification into three types: contentionless  or scheduling , contention  or random , and hanging  or swimming .

In order to provide the required quality of ser- vices to users of 4G, several key technologies will be used with OFDM. There- fore, the next task is to present and update information on key technologies, namely MIMO technology, radio resource management, software defined radio  SDR  communication system, mobile IP, and relaying techniques [1-175]. This chapter starts with the multiantenna technologies in Section 4.2. Multiantenna is one of the key technologies for mitigating the negative effects of the wireless channel, providing better link quality and or higher data rate without consuming extra bandwidth or transmitting power. The use of multiple antennas at either receiver, transmitter, or both ends provides several benefits: array gain, interfer- ence reduction, diversity gain, and or multiplexing gain. Section 4.3 focuses on the main radio resource management functions. They constitute a fundamental aspect for the provision of a variability degree of the quality of service and the effective explanation of the limited radio resource, thus representing a hot research area. The concept of SDR is one of the bridges between software pro- gramming and real hardware implementation. Section 4.4 defines radio commu- nication systems and summarizes the advantages of SDR. In addition, this section discusses the problems that must be overcome to realize the SDR com- munication system and explains the remarkable technologies developed to realize such a system. Section 4.5 deals with IP network issues: Mobile IP architecture, proposed for supporting mobility in Internet, is presented together with guide- lines behind mobility. Section 4.6 introduces the concepts of relaying techniques for 4G, and other enabling techniques are listed in Section 4.7.  111   112  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  4.2 Multiantenna Technologies  Recent years have witnessed an explosive growth of interest in studying and using multiple antenna techniques for wireless communication systems. Such a trend is motivated by the fact that several of the specifications foreseen for future wireless systems appear to be difficult, if not impossible, to fulfill with conven- tional single antenna systems. It is widely accepted that multiple antennas have the potential to increase the achievable data throughput, to enhance link quality  BER, QoS , and to increase cell coverage and network capacity, among others. Such a promising array of enhancements has contributed to speeding up the development in the field, both at academic levels, where countless techniques are developed, and in the industry, where solutions based on these techniques are being rapidly adopted in real systems.  Multiple transmit and receive antennas can be combined with various multiple access techniques such as TDMA, CDMA, and OFDM to improve the capacity and reliability of communications. Multiple-input multiple-output  MIMO  communication systems are regarded as an effective solution for future high-performance wireless networks. The use of multiple antennas at transmit- ter and receiver, popularly known as MIMO, is a promising cost-effective tech- nology that offers substantial leverages in making the anticipated 1-Gbps wireless links a reality.  Several efforts are currently underway to build non-line-of-sight  NLOS  broadband wireless systems. A MIMO wireless system  physical layer and MAC layer technology  using OFDM modulation for NLOS environments was suc- cessfully developed by NTT DoCoMo. In mobile access, there is an effort under the ITU working group to integrate MIMO techniques into the high-speed downlink packet access  HSDPA  channel, which is part of the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System  UMTS  standard. Lucent Technologies recently announced a chip for MIMO enhancement of UMTS HSDPA but has released no further details. Preliminary efforts are also underway to define a MIMO overlay for the IEEE 802.11 standard for WLANs under the newly formed Wireless Next Generation  WNG  group. Moreover, many other com- panies also proposed advanced MIMO schemes for the IEEE 802.16 standard. In this chapter, we provide an overview of MIMO technology and explain recent research directions and results.  4.2.1 Overview of MIMO Technology  Depending on the geometry of two basic multiantenna approaches can be considered: a beamforming approach for closely separated antenna elements  interelement separation is at most λ 2, where λ is the carrier wavelength  or a diversity approach for widely separated  the employed antenna array,   Emerging Technologies for 4G  113  antenna elements  typical interelement spacing is at least a few λ . In this chap- ter, we will explore the latter approach where the fading processes associated with any two possible transmit-receive antenna pair can be assumed to be inde- pendent. The fact that a MIMO system consists of a number of uncorrelated concurrent channels has been exploited from two different perspectives. First, from a pure diversity standpoint, one can enhance the fading statistics of the received signal by virtue of the multiple available replicas being affected by inde- pendent fading channels. By sending the same signal through parallel and inde- pendent fading channels, the effects of multipath fading can be greatly reduced, decreasing the outage probability and hence improving the reliability of the communication link [1]. In the second approach, referred to as spatial multiplexing [2], different information streams are transmitted on parallel spa- tial channels associated with the transmit antennas. This could be seen as a very effective method to increase spectral efficiency. In order to be able to separate the individual streams, the receiver has to be equipped with at least as many receive antennas as the number of parallel channels generated by the transmitter in general. For a given multiple antenna configuration, one may be interested in finding out which approach would provide the best possible or desired performance.  4.2.1.1 Diversity Space-time coding  STC  is a hybrid technique that uses both space and tempo- ral diversity in a combined manner. There are two forms of STC namely space-time block code  STBC  and space-time trellis code  STTC . STBC effi- ciently exploits transmit diversity to combat multipath fading while keeping decoding complexity to a minimum. Tarokh et al. [3] showed that no STBC can achieve full-rate and full-diversity for more than two transmit antennas, and proposed a 3 4 rate, full-diversity code for four transmit antennas. A full-rate quasi-orthogonal  QO  STBC was proposed by Jafarkhani [4] for four transmit antennas based on Alamouti orthogonal STBC [1]. In this case, the transmis- sion matrix is given by  =  C     A 12 − ∗ A 34  A A  34 ∗ 12    =         x 1 − x − x x  4  ∗ 2 ∗ 3  x 2 ∗ x 1 − x − x  ∗ 4 ∗ 3  x 3 − ∗ x 4 ∗ x 1 − x  ∗ 2         x x x x  4 ∗ 3 ∗ 2  1   4.1   where A12, A34 are the Alamouti codes [1]. It is noted here that since the channel matrix of the QO-STBC is not full-rank, full-diversity gain cannot be attained. To achieve the full-diversity and full-rate  FDFR  property, a new FDFR STC approach was recently proposed.   114  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  4.2.1.2 Mixed  Hybrid Diversity and Spatial Multiplexing  This mode combines diversity and spatial multiplexing by transmitting from four transmit antennas, each space-time block coded with the basic Alamouti scheme of order two [1]. The transmission matrix of the space-time block cod- ing for the ith data stream, i = a,b is given by  =  A i     −      x i 1     i x  2  ∗      x i 2     x i 1  ∗     To decode the data, minimum mean square error  MMSE  and zero forc- ing  ZF  receivers can be employed. For the MMSE receiver, we assume that the , where a and b transmitted matrix is indicate different signal streams. First, the tap weight vector and decoding layer order are determined. If the first decoding layer is a, the procedure can be repre- sented by      k a ,      k b ,      k b ,      k  [ a  ]  T  +  +  n  n  n  n  1  2  2  2  1  2   $ a  $ a  2  n  +  1  2  n      k     k    =  decision         w w  H 1 H 2      k     k      y  n        k   The interference from the original signal can be subtracted using $a ; accordingly, the other stream can be decoded as follows:      k  and  n2  1+   4.2    4.3       kn2  $a   4.4       k  =  ′  n  y      k  [  −      k  h  1  y  n   $ b  $  b  2      k     k    =   2  n  +  1  n  decision        h h  3  4      k     k     1  2  n      k   $ ] a  $ a +        ′  kn   y  n  2  2  h     k     k  Note that for comparative purposes we can also employ maximum likeli- hood  ML  decoding  explained in next section  to obtain the optimum perfor- mance, which was used as our baseline reference.  4.2.1.3 Spatial Multiplexing In this section, we briefly review the spatial multiplexing scheme. The vertical Bell Lab layered space time  V-BLAST  architecture has been recently proposed for achieving high spectral efficiency over wireless channels characterized by rich scattering [2]. In this approach, one way of detection is to use conventional adaptive antenna array  AAA  techniques  i.e., linear combining and nulling . Conceptually, each stream  i.e., layer  in turn is considered to be the desired sig- nal, while regarding the remaining signals as interference. Nulling is performed   Emerging Technologies for 4G  115  by linearly weighting the received signals so as to satisfy some performance related criterion, such as ZF or MMSE. This linear nulling approach is viable, but superior performance is obtained if nonlinear techniques are used. One par- ticularly attractive nonlinear alternative is to exploit symbol cancellation as well as linear nulling to perform detection. By using symbol cancellation, the inter- ference from the already-detected components is subtracted from the received signal vector, effectively reducing the overall interference. Here we will consider ordered successive interference cancellation with ZF and MMSE. Also, a ML decoding receiver will be used as a reference.  It is assumed that the  is the channel coefficient from jth transmit antenna to ith receive antenna and w is white Gaussian noise with covariance where NR is the number of received antennas. matrix Then, the received signal vector can be written as follows:  = σ 2  E=  ww  ]  [  C  NR  I  H  w      H kij      k  =      H k x      k  +      k  w  n  y  n   4.5   ]     k  T  ,  where the index k denotes the kth subcarrier,     x k      y k 1 , and w k  is the  NR × 1  noise vector.  ]     k      y k  [  L      x k 1  =  =  x  N  T  R  L  y  N  R  [  Maximum Likelihood Decoding  Optimal Solution  The ML detection of x k  can be found by maximizing the conditional probabil- ity density function and this is equivalent to minimizing the log-likelihood function:      k  $ x  =  min     x k  { y      k  −  }     k  H  { y      k  −  Hx  }     k  Hx   4.6   where,      x k ∈all possible constellation sets. It is well known that ML decoding is characterized by a high implementa- tion complexity, and thus, suboptimal but practically implementable solutions are considered next.  Ordered Successive Interference Cancellation  OSIC  Instead of the ML decoding approach, linear detection techniques can be used  i.e., ZF and MMSE . To improve the linear detection techniques, we try to decode according to received signal strength, and extract the decoded signal from the received signal. This approach is referred to as D-BLAST or V-BLAST [2] according to the transmitted signal structure, where D stands for diagonal and V for vertical. For simplicity, we consider the OSIC.  The receiving operation of OSIC can be summarized as follows:   116  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies    Step 1: Compute the tap weight matrix W.

A scheme based on switching between diversity and spatial multiplexing is proposed by Heath and Paulraj [6]. Authors have considered a fixed rate system in which the receiver adaptively selects one of the two transmission approaches based on the largest minimum Euclidean distance of the received constellation. The receiver informs its selec- tion to the transmitter via a 1-bit feedback channel. To ensure a fixed bit rate, the diversity scheme uses modulation with a higher order than that used by its counterpart spatial modulation case. Skjevling et al. presented a hybrid method combining both diversity and spatial multiplexing [7]. The proposed approach optimally assigns antennas to a given  fixed  transmission scheme combining diversity and spatial multiplexing. Antenna selection is based either on full chan- nel feedback or long-term statistics. Gorokhov et al. studied the relationship between multiplexing gain and diversity gain in the context of antenna subset selection [8], thereby extending the recent result by Zheng and Tse [5].  4.2.3 Open-Loop MIMO Solutions  full-rate code is proposed by Jafarkhani,  = 2 transmit Alamouti developed a remarkable orthogonal FDFR code for N T antennas [1], requiring a simple linear decoder at the receiver. Tarokh et al. [3] = 2 and proposed some proved that a FDFR orthogonal code only exists for N T > 2 attaining full-diversity but not full-rate. In space-time block codes for N T [4] a quasi-orthogonal though full-diversity gain cannot be attained. Based on space-time constellation rota- tion, Xin et al. [9] and Ma et al. [10] proposed a FDFR encoder for an arbitrary number of transmit antennas. For an even number of transmit antennas, Jung et al. [11] obtained coding gain with a FDFR space-time block code by serially concatenating the Alamouti scheme with the constellation rotation techniques used in [9, 10]. Although the Alamouti-based space-time constellation rotation encoder  A-ST-CR  of [11] can effectively achieve full-diversity and full-rate, the decoding complexity is an issue and its practical implementation becomes = 4 . This is prohibitive, even for a small number of transmit antennas  e.g., N T in virtue of the high computational complexity required by the ML decoding algorithm.  In addressing the complexity problem, this chapter further extends the results of [11] by considering a system based on the serial concatenation of a new rotating precoding scheme with the basic Alamouti codes of order two. A proper process of puncturing and shifting after the actual constellation-rotation opera- tion can conveniently decompose the encoding process into rotation operations carried out in a lower order matrix space. The impact of this puncture and shift   118  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  rotation coding scheme is very significant at the receiver, where, due to the pro- vided signal decoupling, the decoding complexity is significantly reduced. It is shown in this chapter that the proposed method attains the same performance as the scheme presented in [11] with a substantial complexity reduction.  References [9-11] use a precoder based on the Vandermonde matrix for attaining a FDFR system. After multiplying the received signal x by the Vandermonde matrix, each component of vector r combines all the symbols as can be observed in the next basic precoder equation.

This linear precoding is referred to as the constellation rotation operation. Notice that the coding advan- tage of [9, 10] is not optimized, although the schemes successfully achieve FDFR. Jung [11] improves the coding advantages by concatenating the constel- lation rotating precoder with the basic Alamouti scheme, resulting in the following transmitted signals:  S =         r 1 − ∗ r 2 0 0  r 2 ∗ r 1 0 0  0 0 r 3 − r  ∗ 4         0 0 r r  4 ∗ 3   4.12   At the receiving end, the signal can be written as  =  y         y y y y  1 ∗ 2  3 ∗ 4         =  1 2   h 1  ∗ h  2  0   0  ∗ 1  h 2 − h 0 0  0 0 h h  3 ∗ 3  0 0 h 4 − h  ∗ 4         2   r 1  r   r   r  3  4         +   n  n   n   n  1 ∗ 2  3 ∗ 4         =  +Hr n   4.13   Note that since r1, r2, r3, r4 already sums over x  through the Vandermonde matrix, each symbol experiences the channel twice.

Consequently, the Vandermonde matrix for the precoder need not be of size 4, but smaller.

When the correlation coefficient is 0.7  Figure 4.3 , the proposed antenna grouping with 3-bit feedback outperforms the conventional STC without antenna grouping more than 1.8 dB at PER = 10−2  1.8 dB for 1 2 rate QPSK, 2.5 dB for 1 2 rate 16QAM, 2.4 dB for 1 2 rate 64QAM, and 3.2 dB for 2 3 rate 64QAM . As a higher MCS level is used, the performance gain is increased.  4.2.4.2 Codebook-Based Closed-Loop MIMO The codebook words are employed in the feedback from mobile station  MS  to base station  BS . The MS learns the channel state information from downlink and selects a transmit beamforming matrix for the codebook. The index of the matrix in the codebook is then fed back to the BS. Each codebook corresponds to a combination of Nt, Ns, and Ni, which are the numbers of BS transmit antennas, available data streams, and bits for the feedback index, respectively. Once Nt, Ns, and Ni are determined in the MS, the MS will feed back the codebook index of Ni bits. After receiving an Ni bit index, the BS will look up the corresponding codebook and select the matrix  or vector  according to the index. The selected matrix will be used as the beamforming matrix in MIMO precoding.  4.3 Radio Resource Management  As the evolution of wireless networks allows for an increasingly wide range of services, the Radio Resource Management  RRM  function, which divides the available resources amongst competing applications, is receiving increased atten- tion. There are several reasons that render RRM very important [49-75]:  1. RRM functions allow the support of a range of different requirements from the various services that the wireless network is required to support.  2. RRM may ensure the planned coverage  i.e., the area where the service  is supported  for each service.  3. RRM may optimize capacity utilization.  Basically, the RRM has the complex task of maximizing the number of users that can be served satisfying their different service requirements, in time varying radio conditions and dynamic traffic behavior. In this section we will focus on the main RRM functions.   126  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  4.3.1 QoS Requirements  In order to guarantee a satisfactory end user quality, the transmission of a data flow, which is originated by the application, has to satisfy certain requirements that define the QoS profile for the information data stream of interest. Usually, the QoS attributes for a particular application service are: required throughput, maximum acceptable delay, maximum acceptable delay jitter, and maximum acceptable bit error rate.  From the end user point of view, the following issues must be taken into  account [53]:    End users only care about the degree of QoS, and not about how it is  provided.  minimum.    Only the QoS perceived by end user matters.   The number of “user defined user controlled” parameters has to be at a    A derivation definition of QoS attribute from the application require-  ments has to be simple.    End-to-end QoS has to be provided.  A very frequent classification of the service class is based on the applica- tion service’s delay requirement. For example, in the UMTS standardization the following four service classes are defined: background class, interactive class, streaming class, and conversational class. The main difference between these classes is the delay sensitivity of the traffic. The conversational class is the most delay sensitive, while the background class is the most delay tolerant. Table 4.1 summarizes the UMTS QoS classes’ main characteristics.  In the standardization the definition of QoS attributes are the same for GPRS Release 99 and UMTS. The QoS attributes for General Packet Radio Service  GPRS  Release 97 98 can be mapped on the Release 99 UMTS attrib- utes as specified in [53]. However, the set of QoS attributes in UMTS is much larger than the set specified in GPRS Release 97 98  Figure 4.4 .  The throughput requirement is dependent on the information source. A throughput of 12 Kbps would be enough in order to transfer speech with GSM quality. For an audio stream with stereo quality, the throughput requirement is higher than 32 or 64 Kbps, while for a video communication it is higher than 128 Kbps.  The BER depends on the service class. For background  e-mail, file trans- fer protocol  FTP   and interactive  web browsing  services, the received data should be error free. Due to the less stringent delay requirements of this service class, higher reliability can be achieved by error correction techniques  e.g.,   Traffic Class  Conversational  Streaming  Interactive  Background  Emerging Technologies for 4G  127  Table 4.1  UMTS QoS Classes  Preserve time relation  variation  between information entities of the stream  Request response pattern Preserve payload content  Destination is not expecting the data within a certain time Preserve payload content  Fundamental Characteristics  Preserve time relation  variation  between information enti- ties of the stream Conversational pattern  stringent and low delay  Voice, video games, voice telephony  Example of the Application  Streaming video  Web browsing, network games  Background download of e-mail  Release 97 98  Precedence  Reliability  Delay  Throughput  Mapping  Delivery of erroneous SDU  Release 99   UMTS  Traffic class  Traffic handling priority  SDU error ratio  Residual bit error ratio  Max bit rate [Kbps]  Allocation retention priority  Delivery order  Max SDU size  Figure 4.4 Mapping of QoS parameters.  packet retransmissions . The use of error correction mechanisms is rather lim- ited by the delay requirement  e.g., for the interactive class . For the streaming and conversational classes, the acceptable BER depends on the type of informa- tion; for speech an acceptable BER is on the order of 10−2 or 10−3 and it may be even smaller for video transfer.  The application may specify its QoS requirements to the network by requesting a radio access bearer  RAB  with any of the specified traffic type, maximum transfer delay, delay variation, bit error rates, and data rates. In   128  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  practice, it should be possible to define the main RAB characteristics from the service quality requirements:    The transmission rate of RAB should be determined by the bandwidth  requirement of the information source.    The choice of dedicated or shared RAB should be based on the require-  ment for the maximum delay and delay jitter.    The SNIR requirement, channel coding, and interleaving for the RAB  should be based on the BER requirement.  4.3.2 General Formulation of the RRM Problem  Let us assume a cellular network with M mobiles in the service area and denote with B = {1, 2, ..., B} the set of all BSs used to provide the necessary coverage. Denote with C the number of available orthogonal channels in the system  i.e., the system capacity . The numbered set of all available channels is C = {1, 2, ..., C}. The channels orthogonality could be established in different ways, such as in time and frequency domain in GSM or in the code domain in Wideband  W-CDMA . In GSM, as a representative of 2G systems, there is an intrinsic upper limit on the system capacity since the upper bound is the number of fre- quencies multiplied with eight time slots. On the other hand, in the WCDMA CDMA scheme, the set of orthogonal channels C is practically infinite and the capacity is determined by the interference condition in the system. A WCDMA system is, therefore, interference limited.  The link  power  gain matrix G characterizes the radio conditions in the  system:  =  G  11   G  G  21  ....   G  B  1  G G  12  22  L L  G 1 G  M  2  M  G  B  2  L  G  BM          4.29   The matrix element Gij represents the link gain between the BS i and MS j; M represents the number of active mobiles. The gain matrix G is dynamic, the dimension M is changing, based on the offered load, and each element Gij changes with the mobile movement. The radio resource management, taking into account the link gain matrix G, assigns [51]:  1. One or more access points from the set B; 2. A channel from the set C;   Emerging Technologies for 4G  129  3. The transmit power of the BS and of the mobile.  The assignments 1 through 3 should maximize the number of users with a sufficient QoS. As outlined in the previous section, providing a stringent defini- tion of the QoS for a communication service is a complex problem. A simple measure of the QoS-namely, the signal-to-interference + noise ratio  SNIR -is here considered. This measure is strongly connected with the performance mea- sures as the bit or frame error probability. Therefore, assignments 1 through 3 aim at maximizing the number of users for which the following inequality holds, for both the uplink  mobile-to-access port  and the downlink  access port-to-mobile :  SNIR  j  =  j  P G jj θ  P G m jm jm  +  N  ≥  γ  j  =  j  1,  ,K  M   4.30   ∑  M ≠ m j  In  4.30 , SNIRj denotes the SNIR at the receiver; Pj is the transmitter power used by the end user j; θjm is the normalized cross-correlation between the signal of interest and the interfering signal from the mobile m  other than j ; N j is the target denotes the thermal noise power at the access port; and while SNIR of the service that is being used by the mobile j.  4.3.3 RRM in Future Wireless Systems  In this section, future RRM developments in wireless LANs and general RRM issues in mobile ad hoc networks  MANETs  are presented.  The Broadband Radio Access Network  BRAN  working group in ETSI is standardizing a wireless LAN for broadband radio access up to 54 Mbps. This new standard is called HIPERLAN 2 and includes physical layer and radio link control and data link control standards  see [61-65] . The interfaces toward other networks  e.g., UMTS  are made via specific design of convergence sublayers. The physical layer of HIPERLAN 2 is aligned with the physical layer of the IEEE 802.11a wireless LAN system [65]. Note here that wireless broad- band networks based on the IEEE 802.11a standard became commercially avail- able in 2002. Among the most important RRM functions in these WLAN systems are the link adaptation function and the radio resources allocation in the MAC frame.  In HIPERLAN 2 and IEEE 802.11 systems there are different pairs of modulation and coding schemes possible. Each pair results in different transmis- sion rate and PER performance, depending on the radio channel quality  i.e., sig- nal-to-interference ratio . The link adaptation scheme can dynamically change   130  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  the pair modulation coding scheme to optimize the throughput based on mea- sured PER, signal level, packet size, and so forth. Extensive analysis of the physi- cal layer performance of these two WLAN systems can be found in [63].  The MAC layer at the two WLAN standards is different. HIPERLAN 2 uses TDMA TDD medium access with frame structure, as presented in Figure 4.5.  The allocation of radio resources is centrally scheduled by the access point  AP , which allows for implementation of scheduling algorithms, QoS differen- tiation, and resource reservation for services with stringent delay and delay varia- tion requirements.  The duration of the broadcast channel  BCH  is fixed. Through these channels the relevant system information is conveyed to the terminals. The duration of the frame control channel  FCH , downlink  DL  and uplink  UL  phase, direct link  DiL  phase, and random channel  RCH  is dynamically adapted to the current load conditions of the AP. DiL phase is present if there are mobile terminals directly communicating on a peer-to-peer basis. Requests for the radio resources are signaled via the RCH, where contention for time slots is present. If scheduled data is transmitted, then FCH is present and it signals the frame structure. The transmission in the DL phase  from the AP to the ter- minals  and UL phase  from terminals to the AP  is contention free. The alloca- tion of resources is signaled via the access feedback channel  ACH , as an answer to the resource request received via the RCH from the previous MAC frame.  The IEEE 802.11a standard, however, has a MAC scheme based on carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance  CSMA CA . A mobile terminal before transmission of data senses the radio channel. If the channel is free then the transmission can commence. Otherwise, an exponential back-off period is implemented before attempting the following packet transmission. This type of MAC  also known as distributed coordination function  makes the IEEE 802.11a standard more suitable for ad hoc wireless networks and non-real-time  background or interactive  type of applications. It should be mentioned that the standard also has contention-free MAC via the point coordination function  PCF , but this alternative is optional even though it could support real-time services. The advantage of the CSMA CA is, however, the avoidance of a cen- tralized scheduler that coordinates the radio transmissions.  2 ms  BCH  FCH  ACH  DL phase  DiL phase  UL phase  RCH  Figure 4.5 HIPERLAN 2 MAC frame structure.

These networks are described by the IETF MANET group  source IETF MANET group :  A MANET is an autonomous system of mobile routers  and associated hosts  connected by wireless links, the union of which forms an arbitrary graph. The routers are free to move randomly and organize themselves arbitrarily; thus, the network’s wireless topology may change rapidly and unpredictably. Such a network may operate in a stand-alone fashion, or may be connected to the larger Internet.  Currently, there are many research activities in the RRM field for MANETs. Due to the specific characteristics of MANETs, such as dynamic topology, limited node performance, distributed algorithms, and so forth, the development of RRM functions is a difficult task. The most important factors in MANETs are the coverage  or connectivity  and the capacity [66, 67]. An extensive field of research is QoS-aware routing  see [68] for one typical exam- ple  and MAC with QoS support [69]. A common MAC design for MANETs is driven by the hidden exposed terminal problem. However, the QoS constraints for particular applications require from the MAC layer additional functionalities to provide certain guarantees and to make distinctions among different types of connections. Furthermore, MAC has to interact with QoS-aware routing in an appropriate way to provide the required communication quality over the whole path from source to destination  i.e., over the multiple hops . The current MAC proposals [69] that support QoS provisioning and differentiation are based on resource reservation along the connection’s path, and differentiation between non-real-time and real-time connection establishment and maintenance.  The recent important development in the RRM field for multimedia wire- less communication is that for systems beyond UMTS. In these systems the last wireless hop towards the end user could be carried over different radio access networks. Here, the interworking of UMTS, WLAN or HIPERLAN 2, and GSM GPRS networks will play an important role. For example, the wireless operators could have in their coverage areas multiple possibilities for wireless communications via different radio access networks, as presented in Figure 4.6. In this type of wireless networks, the setup of the Common RRM  CRRM  functions will play an important role in the efficient utilization of the available radio bandwidths. To achieve this goal the CRRM will perform traffic addressing towards less loaded wireless access systems. CRRM will choose the right radio access technology based on service requirements, current wireless sys- tem load, propagation conditions, interference, and capacity cost induced in the wireless network. This field is very challenging and interesting for future RRM research.   132  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  Common radio resource management  GERAN  UTRAN  IEEE 802.11a  HIPERLAN 2  Figure 4.6 Interworking of different wireless access networks and common RRM.  4.4 Software Defined  SDR  Radio Communication Systems  As the number of wireless communication systems that users can use increase, there has been increasing demands for the coexistence of several mobile telecom- munication services; for example, GSM, or IS-54, or IS-136, or IS-95, Japanese Personal Digital Cellular  PDC  or Personal Handy Phone System  PHS  or IMT-2000 system. Currently, if one wants to be globally connected, more than one terminal may be needed, though it is becoming more common to find multistandard terminals.  A person working on SDR is expected to be familiar with any communica- tion system whether it is for radio transmission or multiple access purposes. Such schemes can be developed and written in programming languages like MATLAB or C. These computer simulation languages have a good relationship with software languages that configure digital signal processing hardware  DSPH  such as digital signal processors  DSP , field programmable gate arrays  FPGA , and application-specific integrated circuits  ASIC . A typical software language for DSPH is very high speed integrated circuit hardware description language  VHDL  and Verilog-HDL. DSPH has been utilized to configure the mobile terminals and base stations of mobile communication systems. DSPH is   Emerging Technologies for 4G  133  a general-purpose language, and the configuration can be programmed by downloading digital signal processing software  DSPS . This means that users can download DSPS describing the desired elemental components into the DSPH of only one terminal. This the basic concept of an SDR communication system [76-90].  is  Software defined radio in theory will allow mobile terminal manufacturers to design and manufacture products that are independent of any particular spec- ifications or standard. This means that users or the terminal itself can select the most appropriated air interface to be used based on channel conditions, traffic, cost, and so forth. There are benefits from the ecological point of view as well: SDR reduces the amount of hardware, which, in turn, reduces the amount of industrial waste.  Research into radio communication systems based on DSPH began in early 1990. These early studies, however, did not examine DSP-based radio communication systems from the viewpoint of reconfigurable radio communi- cation systems. As far as we know, the first paper to coin the phrase “SDR” is that of Mitola [76]. Mitola described the fundamental and functional architec- ture of SDR. One prototype, the military SDR, SPEAKeasy, was introduced in [77]. SPEAKeasy can use several voice and data military services; the frequency band is 2 MHz to 2 GHz.  Most of the research towards realizing the ultimate communication system  has focused on [78-82]:  1. The architecture of the DSPH; 2. The configuration of the analog signal processing hardware; 3. The method of downloading software to the hardware; 4. The method of application of software defined radio.  4.4.1 Definition of SDR Communication System  Figure 4.7 shows the basic configuration of the SDR of [76]. The radio consists of eight units:  1  antenna unit,  2  radio frequency signal processing unit  RFU ,  3  intermediate frequency signal processing unit  IFU ,  4  ana- log-to-digital conversion  ADC  and digital-to-analog conversion  DAC  unit,  5  baseband signal processing unit  BBU ,  6  transmission control unit  TCU ,  7  input output  I O  processing unit  IOU , and  8  end-to-end tim- ing processing unit  TPU . Each unit will be described in detail.  1. Antenna unit. An omnidirectional, low loss, and broadband antenna is required because it can be used in a variety of wireless communication systems. Moreover, signal processing technology based on array   134  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  Transmitter  Receiver   1   Antenna  unit   2   Radio  frequency unit  RFU    3   Intermediate frequency unit  IFU    4   A D & D A unit ADC DAC   5   Baseband unit  BBU    6   Transmission control unit   TCU    7  I O  processing unit  IOU    8   End-to-End  timing  processing unit  TPU   Software  Software  Software  Software  Software  Software  Software  Common infrastructure  Figure 4.7 Basic configuration of the SDR in [76].  antennas makes it possible to select the performance of the SDR according to the surroundings and to perform optimum selection of the algorithm by using SDR technology. Such an antenna is called a smart antenna or software antenna [83, 84]. The software antenna is capable of space division multiple access  SDMA , in which the antenna steer the beam in the direction of selected users by computing appropriate weight coefficients for the antenna elements. Multiple access is achieved by changing the direction of the antenna or beams, or by interference cancellation, in which the antenna configures its direction to the desired user or allocates null points to the direction of undesired users or signals.  2. Radio frequency signal processing unit. In the transmitter’s RFU, the signals coming from the IFU or BBU are up-converted to the radio frequency band signals, amplified, and transmitted to the antenna unit. At the receiver, the signals received by antenna unit are amplified to a constant level that is suitable for signal processing and directly down-converted to a lower frequency band such as IF band or base- band. The signal processing is done by an analog circuit. The linearity or efficiency of the RF amplifier and the conversion method to the lower frequency band at the receiver are the main discussion points. Intermediate frequency signal processing unit. In this unit, the signals from ADC DAC unit are up-converted to the IF band signal, ampli- fied, and transferred to the RFU of the transmitter. At the receiver, the signals from the RFU unit are amplified to an adequate level for signal processing in the IFU and directly down-converted to a suitable fre- quency for the ADC DAC unit or baseband unit. When the signals of  3.   Emerging Technologies for 4G  135  several systems are received at the receiver, the required frequency band must be selected by using a filter.  4. Analog-to-digital conversion and digital-to-analog conversion unit. In this unit, the digital signal from the baseband unit is converted to an analog signal by using a DAC and the converted signal is transferred to the upper frequency band unit  IFU or RFU . At the receiver, the sig- nals from the IFU or RFU are amplified to an adequate level for ana- log-to-digital conversion. The stabilized signal is then sampled by ADC and converted to a digital signal. In this unit, the sampling method is a key technology.  5. Baseband signal processing unit. In this unit, data is digitally modu- lated and transferred to the ADC DAC unit of the transmitter. Trans- mitted data is recovered by using the sampled signal from the ADC DAC unit and digital signal processing at the receiver. The basic configuration of the BBU is shown in Figure 4.8 [77]. In the BBU of the transmitter, frame, coding, mapping and modulation, and trans- mission filter blocks are the key blocks. On the other hand, in the BBU of the receiver, receiver filter, code and symbol timing, sampling rate conversion  resample , demapping and demodulation, and decod- ing blocks are the key blocks. Moreover, in the BBU of the receiver, the fading compensation  equalization  block and the interference can- cellation block for eliminating undesired signals are present. In most cases, the BBU is configured by several DSPH such as DSP and or FPGA and or ASIC. All component blocks are described using DSPS written in VHDL or Verilog-HDL and compiled. The BBU’s configu- ration can be modified by changing the DSPS.  6. Transmission control unit. In this unit, the input bit stream format for the BBU is configured at the transmitter by adjusting the transmission protocol of the MAC layer, and at the receiver, the detected data from the BBU is checked according to the data format of the transmission protocol of the MAC layer. If the number of bit errors in the detected data is large, retransmission is requested. In addition to this transmis- sion control, this unit can manage cryptograph. In most cases, TCU can be configured by a range of DSPHs, and all the component blocks are also described using DSPS. By changing DSPS, the TCU can con- figure the transmission protocol as needed. Input output processing unit. In the mobile station, all information data comes from a handset, PDA terminal, or personal computer, and all received data comes back to these terminals or computers. The I O and timing are managed so as to connect with the external terminals flexibly.  7.   136  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  i  t n e c i f f e o c  p a t  f o  .  m u n  r e t l i F  l  e p m a s f o  .  m u N  . l v e  l  .  d o m  f o  .  m u N  d o h t e m g n p p a m  i  d o h t e m g n d o C  i  e z i s e v a e l r e t n  i  l  s e b m a t s o p &  e r p f o  .  m u N  a t a d d n a  d n a h c I    m o r f h c Q    t i n u F I  t u p t u O  l  k c o b r e t l i F  d n a g n p p a M  i  l  n o i t a u d o m  l  n o i t a e r r o C  l  e p m a s p U  i  g n d o C  e m a r F  t u p n I    r e t t i  m s n a r t    t i n u e r a w d r a h g n i s s e c o r p  l  a n g i s l  a t i g D  i    r e v i e c e r   y t i n u e r a w d r a h g n i s s e c o r p  l  a n g i s l  a t i g D  i  d n a h c I    t u p t u O    - h c Q  i  g n d o c e D  i  & g n p p a m e D  l  n o i t a u d o m e d  l  e p m a s - e R  r e t e m a r a p t u p n I  l  e p m a s f o  .  m u N  g n m  i  i t e d o C  c n y s  g n m  i  i t  l  o b m y S  c n y s  d o h t e m g n d o C  i  e z i s e v a e l r e t n  i  l v e  l  .  d o m  f o  .  m u N  d o h t e m g n p p a m  i  e d o c f o h t g n e L  e d o c f o h t g n e L  y l o p  .  e n e G  t o n r o  .  h t r o  .  n e g e d o C  1 e t a G  n o i t c e e S  l  e t a g  i  t n e c i f f e o c  p a t  f o  .  m u n  r e t l i F  l  n o i t a e r r o C  l  n o i t a e r r o C  2 e t a G  l  k c o b r e t l i F  d n a h c I    m o r f h c Q    t i n u F I  t u p n I  .  n o i t a r u g i f n o c U B B c s a B  i  8  .  4 e r u g i F   Emerging Technologies for 4G  137  8. End-to-end timing processing unit. This unit controls the transmis- sion delay between transmitter and receiver. For example, the trans- mission delay for voice must be shorter than 150 ms  typically .  In most SDR systems, several software programs, which describe all tele- communication components in DSPS language, are used to configure the com- ponents on the DSPH. This software can be readily changed to suit the requirements of a particular system. Such a SDR system is called a full-down- load-type SDR system. Figure 4.9 shows the configuration of a full-down- load-type SDR system. The system has an RFU, IFU, and BBU as in the basic system. Moreover, it has a TX module, which is related to the transmitter, and an RX module, which is related to the receiver.  Implementing a specific telecommunication system with a full-down- load-type SDR system requires that all necessary DSPS be downloaded to the BBUs before starting communication. DSPS blocks, including frame block, encoder block, mapping and modulation block, and filter block  Figure 4.8  are downloaded to the BBU of the TX module. DSPS blocks, including filter block, equalizer block, detector and decoder block  Figure 4.9 , are also described in DSPS and downloaded to the BBU of the RX module. After software has been downloaded, the configuration check program is executed. The BBU then  Digital signal processing software  TX module  BPF  U C  Power cont.

Then, transmitted data can then be fed into the BBU of the TX module.  In the BBU of TX module, this data are formatted into frames, modulated and converted into two signals: in-phase channel  Ich  and quadrature-phase channel  Qch  signals by the DSP blocks mentioned above. These signals are fed into the IFU of the TX module.  In the IFU of the TX module, the digitally modulated Ich and Qch signals are converted from digital to analog by a D A converter block. These signals are quadrature modulated on the IF band and sent to the RFU of the TX module. In the RFU of the TX module, the quadrature-modulated signal is up-converted to the RF band by power control part before being transmitted.  To receive the RF signal, the received signal is fed into the RFU of the RX module. Here, the received RF data is bandpass-filtered, which eliminates spuri- ous signals, and down-converted to the IF band. The automatic gain control  AGC  block keeps the power of the down-converted signal at a constant level. This power-controlled signal is fed into the IFU of the RX module.  In the IFU of the RX module, the received signal from the RFU is split into Ich and Qch signals by using a quadrature demodulator block. The A D converter block then oversamples and transfers them into the BBU of the RX module.  In the BBU of the RX module, all telecommunication component blocks have been implemented into the DSPH before starting communication, and the configuration of what has been checked by a test program. The oversampled Ich and Qch signals are filtered and equalized by a customized method, and they are detected and decoded by using the filter, equalizer, and decoder blocks in the BBU of RX module.  4.4.2 Advantages of SDR Communication Systems  In full-download-type SDR, the system configuration can be changed on demand. There are many advantages not only for operators and service provid- ers but also for government and commercial customers.  In particular, for commercial operators and service providers the advan-  tages are:  1. Global roaming services; 2. Upgradeable terminals; 3. New services added without having to change the terminal; 4. Bugs fixed without the need to recall the product; 5. Versatile software  i.e., wireless communication software that can be installed in other electrical products as well as in the mobile terminal .   Emerging Technologies for 4G  139  For government agencies, the advantages are:  1. Global roaming services can be offered to customers; 2. SDR reduces the variety of hardware, since several standards can be  implemented in a single mobile terminal.  For customers, the advantages are:  1. Unlimited global roaming; 2. One terminal for many services; 3. New services provided without needing to upgrade hardware; 4. New services added to the terminal without changing the terminal; 5. Bugs fixed without needing to recall the product.  4.4.3 Problems in SDR Communication Systems  As shown in Section 4.4.2, SDR has many advantages, but the technology must overcome the following problems.  1. The volume of software downloaded to the DSPH increases as the contents of the required telecommunication component blocks become more complicated. As a result, the download time is length- ened. In addition, the software files to be transmitted need to be pro- tected by an adequate channel coding scheme to make the transmission more robust to fading and interference. In this case, the download time becomes even longer [87, 88].  2. The period for the configuration check of the DSPH also increases since the contents of the required telecommunication component blocks become more complicated. The problem also affects the stabil- ity of the operating characteristic of the DSPH when there is not a suf- ficient period of time for the configuration check [87, 88]. In the downloaded software, there are often several component blocks containing manufacturer-specific know-how  e.g., the optimization method or calculation algorithm for some special blocks . There is the possibility that this know-how may leak out when the software is downloaded. There is also the possibility that it may be tampered with [87, 88].  3.  In addition to the above problems, if SDR controls RF and IFU as well as  the baseband unit, the following issues must be considered.   140  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  1. By using SDR, a user must download only the software describing the elemental components to the hardware for realizing a particular com- munication system. However, if several communication systems oper- ating on different frequency bands are integrated into one mobile communication hardware by SDR technology, several antenna units, RFUs, IFUs, and ADC DAC units are still needed in the mobile com- munication hardware. Moreover, a user may want to use several sys- tems simultaneously [89], in which case several ADC DAC units, baseband units, transmission control units, I O processing units, and end-to-end timing processing units must be prepared. The method of managing several units must be considered. If several communication systems operating on different frequency bands are integrated into one mobile communication hardware by SDR technology, a broadband antenna must be used. Since the band- width of antenna is limited, however, several antennas are needed. The placement of these antennas in the terminal is an important design issue to be taken into consideration.  2.  Moreover, from the viewpoint of the entire system, the following ques-  tions arise:  1. Which services are to be integrated in one SDR terminal? Say that a multimode terminal can easily be realized by developing a specific ASIC for each communication system and planning these ASICs on one circuit board. In this case, SDR technology is unnecessary. There- fore, SDR technology should be targeted to application fields in which many communication systems are required.  2. How and in which field is the SDR technology socially recognized? There are many applications for SDR technology. These applications must be identified.  3. How and in which field is standardization to be done? How should the software be protected against viruses or hackers? In particular, SDR’s capability of international roaming by changing software instead of changing terminal becomes a serious threat, if a virus is included that can reconfigure a wireless communication system. A simple example is the reconfigured terminal in which the transmitter no longer matches the receiver. Moreover, a virus altering the trans- mission power to a much higher level than the regulation threatens to shut down all wireless communication systems in the world. Refer- ence [90] describes wireless terrorism. In wireless terrorism, all users of SDR effectively become potential terrorists. To prevent such an   Emerging Technologies for 4G  141  incident from occurring, standardization must be done. In addition, the organizations and radio that certify SDR terminals must be devel- oped. Software radio thus presents a new paradigm in radio law.  4.4.4  Future Applications of SDR Communication Systems  Future Telecommunication Applications  4.4.4.1 The following applications are envisioned for the future.  Mobile Communication Terminal. A SDR technology-based mobile communica- tion terminal allows users to select a system by changing the software of the DSPH. Moreover, users can select the provider company that they like. How- ever, to implement them will require miniaturization, reduction of the power consumption and cost of the hardware, as well as reduction in software down- load time. An efficient system selection procedure is also required.  Mobile Communication Base Station. The base station that has SDR technology would make it easy to implement new communication systems and fix bugs. In addition, a base station could use more than one algorithm to fight against fad- ing. Moreover, by using an adaptive array antenna, the antenna beam shape could also be controlled with software. To realize this application, we must make a rule for programming software that configures components for the mo- bile communication system to change the program easily and to make the con- nection with other components. Moreover, a fast ADC or digital signal processor is needed to perform real-time transmission.  Broadband Radio Access System. Software radio technology can enhance the flexibility of a broadband radio access system, which operates between base sta- tions and buildings. For example, software can be used for components such as distortion compensators and interference suppressors. The modulation scheme also can be changed, and the best components selected. Using an adaptive array antenna would allow the beam shape to be controlled with software. To do so, each module should be implemented by software, and also, the connections be- tween modules should be programmable by software. A high speed ADC or dig- ital signal processor must also be used to perform real-time transmission.  Intelligent Transport System. The communication systems utilized in the intelligent transport system  ITS  are shown in Table 4.2. They fall in three cat- egories: communication-based systems, control-based systems, and broadcast- ing-based systems. Representative examples of communication-based systems are Personal Digital Cellular  PDC , PHS, and digital cellular using CDMA.   142  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  Table 4.2  Simulation Models  System  PHS  GPS  Frequency  1.9-GHz band  1.5-GHz band  ETC  5.8 GHz  Modulation  p 4DQPSK TDMA-TDD  BPSK + DS-Spread Spectrum  ASK  Manchester code   Data Rate  384 Kbps  50 bps  1,024 Kbps  Bandwidth  300 kHz 1ch  1.023 MHz  Less than 8 MHz  The global positioning system  GPS  system, vehicle information and commu- nication system  VICS  system, and radar are representative examples of con- trol-based systems. The Advanced Cruise-Assist Highway System  AHS -which provides information on traffic accidents, road obstructions, and meteorological phenomenon-and the electronic toll collection  ETC  system will be mounted in cars. Representative examples of broadcasting-based systems are radio broad- casting systems, analog-television broadcasting systems, satellite broadcasting systems, and digital television systems. As mentioned above, the number of communication systems appearing in the ITS system will likely increase. This means that space-saving and integration of system components must be chief concerns if so many services are to be provided in the limited space of a car. SDR technology envisions that these services will be provided by only one small ter- minal. Figure 4.10 shows the potential application. The method of introducing SDR technology is the same as described in the first three applications above. In the ITS, the number of services that can be used in a car is more than 10. Therefore, we urge implementation of SDR technology as soon as possible.  4.4.4.2 Broadcasting Applications Software radio technology can realize automatic switching between terrestrial wave BS CS CATV. It is easy to introduce new services on existing hardware because only the software needs to be changed, as was discussed before. More- over, receivers compatible with the standards of many countries or regions can be realized. This would have an impact on the promotion and distribution of international products. Such a multimode, multistandard receiver must have a broadband antenna and software describing the components of the particular communication system, and this means that the connectivity between compo- nents must be increased.

Current terminals for these networks do not have any connectivity with each other. Soft- ware radio can be used to create a universal terminal that works on any private network. In the near future, these huge networks will not only complement but also compete with conventional public networks.  4.4.4.4 Certification Method of SDR One problem facing practical implementation of SDR is wireless terrorism. The potential types of damage are shown in Figure 4.12. In some cases, downloaded data may be illegally altered or have embedded in it a computer virus. Altered or virus software may cause unexpected and even dangerous changes in the base station  e.g., the BS could be commanded to shut down or increase transmission power over permitted levels, or it could be permanently damaged . In order to avoid such wireless terrorism, a new certification method for the systems using SDR must be required in the certification organizations.  An example of certification is shown in Figure 4.13. The certification method has two stages. In the first stage, the certification organization checks the relationship between input data and output data by changing the software that configures several systems. In this case, for each system, the transmission power, transmission bandwidth, and electric power leakage in the adjacent  For educational use  For office use  For community use  For emergency use  For ITS use  For commercial use  Software radio on private network  P.S.T.N.

During the handshake, if the password is certificated, the software is downloaded from memory to the DSPH, otherwise the SDR equipment issues a warning. The public key cryptography technique is a candidate for the certification password. Moreover, the download protocol between the memory and the DSPH must be standardized and the protocol must be certificated.  The second stage of certification involves the modules that configure SDR. To certify each component, the configuration of SDR must be changed. An example of configuration is shown in Figure 4.13 b . Here, switching or inter- face modules are inserted between functional modules to configure the SDR equipment. These switching or interface modules can be controlled from out- side of the DSPH. By switching modules, each functional module is certificated. The switching or interface module must be standardized for such a certification procedure to work.  4.4.5 Summary  One of the future applications of the software programming method is in the SDR communication systems. The concept of SDR bridges the software pro- gramming and hardware implementation.  This section has described the SDR communication system, its advantages and its problems, as well as some possible future applications. This technology will likely become key to the success of forth generation mobile communication systems, because nowadays there are many systems in the world and these sys- tems must be integrated.  4.5  IP Network Issues  The evolution towards a common, flexible, and seamless IP-based core network that will connect heterogeneous networks gives rise to several issues at the net- work layer [91-160]. The need for ensured QoS is the key of this evolution. Fundamentally, the day that packet-switched networks can credibly approach the QoS of circuit-switched networks is the day customers stop paying for two networks. The QoS problem involves integrating delay-sensitive applications such as voice, audio, and video onto a single network with delay-insensitive applications, such as e-mail, fax, and static file transfer. That network must be able to discriminate, differentiate, and deliver communications, content, and commerce services. Moreover, it needs to support communication services cre- ation, modification, bundling, and billing in a way that is unobtrusive yet pow- erful for end users, especially business users. The scenario becomes more challenging as QoS and security issues are faced in a mobile environment. The   148  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  Internet has not been designed with mobility in mind and lacks mechanisms to support mobile users. Some architectures have been proposed for supporting mobility in the Internet. The most important is Mobile IP, which will be dis- cussed in Section 4.5.2. Before that, some guidelines behind mobility manage- ment are discussed in Section 4.5.1. Proposals to solve some of the open issues in Mobile IP are described in Section 4.5.3.  4.5.1 Mobility Management  When a mobile node is roaming through one or more service areas, mobility management mechanisms may be required to locate it for call delivery and maintenance of its connections. Generally, in cellular systems, mobility manage- ment is performed through two main mechanisms:  1. Location management is used for discovering the current attachment point of the mobile user for call delivery. It consists of two phases. In the first phase, called the location registration  or location update , the mobile terminal periodically notifies the network for its new access point, allowing the network to authenticate the user and revise the user’s location profile. The second phase is call delivery. The network is queried for user location profile and the current position of the mobile host is found.  2. Handoff management enables the user to keep its connection alive as it moves and changes its access point to the network. This is performed in three steps: initiation, connection generation, and data flow control.  When the user moves within a service area or cell and changes communi- cations channels allocated by the same BS, the mobility management procedure is called intracell handoff. Intercell handoff occurs when the user moves into an adjacent service area or cell for which all mobile connections are transferred to a new BS. While performing handoff, a mobile terminal can be simultaneously connected to two or more BSs and use some kind of signaling diversity to com- bine the multiple signals. This condition is called soft handoff. In hard handoff, the mobile device switches from one base station to another with active data being forwarded on only one path at a time.  4.5.1.1 Mobility Classes In general, there are four categories that support IP mobility:  1. Pico-mobility is the movement of a mobile node  MN  within the same BS. The operating space is the space around person that typically   Emerging Technologies for 4G  149  extends up to 10m in all directions and envelops the person, being either stationary or in motion.  2. Micro-mobility is the movement of an MN within or across different BSs within a subnet; this occurs very rapidly. Management of micro-mobility is accomplished using link-layer support  layer 2 pro- tocol , which is already implemented in existing cellular networks.  3. Macro-mobility is the movement of an MN across different subnets within a single domain or region; this occurs relatively less frequently. This is currently handled by Internet mobility protocols such as Mobile IP.  4. Global mobility is the movement of an MN among different admin- istrative domains or geographical regions. This is also handled by layer 3 techniques such as Mobile IP.  Mobility management has a responsibility of providing uninterruptible connectivity during micro- and macro-mobility, which usually occur over rela- tively short time scales. Global mobility, on the other hand, usually involves lon- ger time scales. Therefore, the goal is just to ensure that mobile users can reestablish communication after they change the domain, but not necessarily to provide uninterruptible connectivity.  4.5.1.2 Architectures for Mobility Supporting There are several frameworks that support mobile users, and the IETF standard- izes two of them: Mobile IP and Session Initiation Protocol  SIP .  1. Mobile IP [91] supports application-layer transparent IP mobility. The basic Mobile IP protocol does not require protocol upgrades in stationary correspondent nodes  CNs  and routers. Its drawback is that it does not consider the integration of additional functions such as authentication and billing, which are critical for successful adoption in commercial networks.  2. SIP [92] is an application-layer control  signaling  protocol that can establish, modify, and terminate multimedia sessions or calls. The main disadvantage of SIP mobility is that it cannot support transmis- sion control protocol  TCP  connections and is also not an appropri- ate solution for micro- or macro-mobility.  SIP mobility will not be a subject of further discussion in this chapter;  instead the focus will be on Mobile IP.   150  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  4.5.2 Mobile IP  Mobile IP refers to a set of protocols, developed and still under development by the IETF to allow the Internet Protocol to support the mobility of a node [91]. The idea for Mobile IP first emerged in 1995 and since then it has undergone some changes.  First of all, it is necessary to understand what makes the IP mobility com- plicated. An IP address consists of two parts: a prefix that identifies the subnet in which the node is located, and a part that identifies the node within the subnet. Routers use look-up tables to forward incoming packets according to their desti- nation addresses. A router does not store the addresses of all computers in the Internet, which is not feasible. Only prefixes are stored in the routing tables and some optimizations are applied. Therefore, as a receiver moves outside the origi- nal subnet, it can no longer be reached. A new IP address should be assigned to the mobile node, but this operation requires time. Specifically, the Domain Name System  DNS  needs time to update its internal tables for mapping a logi- cal name to an IP address. Therefore, this approach cannot work if the node moves quite often. Moreover, a browser and a Web server being, respectively, client and server in communicating, generally use the TCP IP protocol suite to establish a reliable end-to-end communication. Using TCP means that a virtual connection must be established before data transmission and reception. When a logical circuit is created, both connection sides must be assigned port numbers in order to let application layers keep track of the communications. Every end-to-end TCP connection is identified by four values: client IP address, client TCP port, server IP address, and server TCP port. These values must be con- stant during the conversation. Therefore, a TCP connection will not survive any address change.  Allowing the mobile nodes the use of two IP addresses provides the solu- tion to the above problem. In Mobile IP, home address remains unchanged regardless of where the node is attached to the Internet and it is used to identify TCP IP connections. Another IP address, which is dynamic, is assigned to the mobile node when it moves to another network different than its home net- work. This address is called the care-of address  COA  and it is used to identify the mobile node point of attachment in the network topology. Using its home address, the mobile node is seen by other Internet hosts as a part of its own home network. In other words, other Internet hosts do not have to know the actual mobile node’s location. The home agent  HA  is located in the home net- work. Whenever the mobile node is not attached to its home network but to another network, called the foreign network  FN , the home agent gets all pack- ets destined for the mobile node and arranges their delivering to the foreign agent  FA . The FA then sends the packets to the mobile node. An HA can be imple- mented on a router that is responsible for the home network. This position is   Emerging Technologies for 4G  151  quite appropriate because without any optimization to mobile IP, all packets for the MN have to go through the router anyway. An alternative solution consists in making the router behave as a manager for MNs belonging to a virtual home network. In this case, all MNs are always in a foreign network. The HA could also be implemented on an arbitrary node in the subnet. This solution is neces- sary when the router software cannot be changed, but it has the disadvantage that there is a double-crossing of the router by the packet if the MN is in a for- eign network.  In general, the Mobile IP concept can be considered as a combination of  three major functions:  1. Discovery mechanism, which allows mobile computers to determine  their IP address as they move from network to network;  2. Registering of the new IP address with its home agent; 3. Tunneling  delivery  of packets to the new IP address of the mobile  node.  4.5.3  Evolution of Mobile IP  Mobile IPv4 is insufficient to meet the requirements of the evolving communi- cation scenario for several reasons.  Macro-Mobility. Open issues in Mobile IPv4 related to macro-mobility man- agement include the following:    Asymmetric  Triangle  routing.   Inefficient direct routing: The routing procedure in Mobile IPv4, with  respect to the number of hops or end-to-end delay, is inefficient.    Inefficient home agent notification: When a mobile node hands off from one network to another, it has to notify the home agent about that. This operation is inefficient in Mobile IPv4.    Inefficient binding deregistration: In Mobile IPv4, if a mobile node moves to a new FA, then the previous FA could not release the resources occupied by the mobile node. The previous FA must wait until a bind- ing registration lifetime expires.  Micro-Mobility. Mobile IPv4 is not concerned with micro-mobility issues. Since it is expected that in the near future, Mobile IP will be a core wireless IP architecture interconnecting different wireless networks, the interoperability   152  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  between macro-mobility and micro-mobility issues is very important. There are several open issues in this context:    Local management of micro-mobility events: In micro-mobility dimen- sion, handoffs occur very frequently. Therefore the handoff procedures should be managed as locally as possible.    Seamless intradomain handoff: After intradomain handoff, the IP data stored into the previous entities  e.g., base stations  should be trans- ferred to the new BS.    Mobility router crossings in an intranet: During intradomain handoff,  the router crossings should be avoided as much as possible.  4.5.3.1 Mobile IPv6 The IETF began work in 1994 on IPv6, a proposed standard designed to address various problems with Mobile IPv4. The IETF skipped the IPv5 stan- dard because network operators had already adopted many of the protocol’s potential provisions before it could be adopted.  Mobile IPv6 is supposed to replace Mobile IPv4. One of the main advan- tages of IPv6 over IPv4 is the higher number of IP addresses. IPv4’s 32-bit addressing scheme can support a theoretical maximum of 4.29 billion IP addresses. However, due to the operational inefficiency, useful IP addresses are about 200 million. IPv6 offers a 128-bit addressing scheme that permits about 21,033 useful IP addresses.  Other major differences between Mobile IPv4 and the Mobile IPv6 [146]  are:    Mobile IPv6 supports the mechanism of route optimization. This fea- ture is already an integral part of the Mobile IPv6 protocol. In Mobile IPv4 the route optimization feature is just a set of extensions that may not be supported by all IP nodes.    Mobile IPv6 specifies a new feature that allows mobile nodes and Mobile IP to coexist efficiently with routers that perform ingress filter- ing [147]. The packets sent by a mobile node can pass normally through ingress filtering firewalls. This is possible because the COA is used as the source address in each packet’s IP header. Also, the mobile node home address is carried in the packet in a home address destination option [146]. In this way, the use of the COA in the packet is transpar- ent above the IP layer.    The use of the COA as the source address in each packet’s IP header simplifies the routing of multicast packets sent by a mobile node. Thus,   Emerging Technologies for 4G  153  the tunneling of the multicast packets to its home agent will no longer be necessary in Mobile IPv6. The home address can still be used and it is compatible with multicast routing that is based in part on the packet source address.    Neighbor discovery [148] and address autoconfiguration [149] enable the functionality of the foreign agents instead of using special routers. The foreign agents are not required any more in Mobile IPv6. Thus, the issue of mobility router crossings in an intranet is resolved.    The Mobile IPv6 uses IPsec for all security requirements  e.g., sender authentication, data integrity protection, and replay protection for binding updates-which serve the role of both registration and route optimization in Mobile IPv4 . Mobile IPv4 is based on its own security mechanisms for each function, based on statically configured mobility security associations.    Mobile IPv6 provides a mechanism for supporting bidirectional  i.e., packets that the router sends reach the mobile node, and packets that the mobile node sends reach the router  confirmation of a mobile node ability to communicate with its default router in its current location. This bidirectional confirmation can be used to detect the black hole sit- uation, where the link to the router does not work equally well in both directions. Unlike Mobile IPv6, Mobile IPv4 does not support bidirectional confirmation. Only the forward direction  packets from the router are reaching the mobile node  is confirmed, and therefore the black hole situation may not be detected.    In Mobile IPv6, the correspondent node sends packets to a mobile node while it is away from its home network using an IPv6 routing header rather than IP encapsulation, whereas Mobile IPv4 must use encapsula- tion for all packets. In this way ReSerVation Protocol  RSVP  opera- tion in Mobile IP is enabled and also the problem of ingress filtering is partially solved. In Mobile IPv6, however, the home agents are allowed to use encapsulation and tunnel the packets to the mobile node.    In Mobile IPv6, the home agent intercepts the packets, which arrive at the home network and are destined for a mobile node that is away from home, using IPv6 neighbor discovery [148] rather than Address Resolu- tion Protocol  ARP  [100] like in Mobile IPv4.    IPv6 encapsulation  and the routing header  removes the need to man- age tunnel soft state, which was required in Mobile IPv4 due to limita- tions in ICMP error procedure. In Mobile IPv4, an ICMP error message that is created because of a failure to deliver an IP packet to the COA will be returned to the home network, but it will not contain the   154  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  IP address of the original source of the tunneled IP packet. This is solved in the home agent by storing the tunneling information  i.e., which IP packets have been tunneled to which COA , called tunneling soft state.    Mobile IPv6 defines a new procedure, called anycast. Using this feature, the dynamic home agent discovery mechanism returns one single reply to the mobile node, rather than the corresponding Mobile IPv4 mecha- nism that used IPv4 directed broadcast and returned a separate reply from each home agent on the home network. The Mobile IPv6 mecha- nism is more efficient and more reliable. In this way, only one packet requires to be replied to the mobile node.    In Mobile IPv6, an advertisement interval option on router advertise- ments  equivalent to agent advertisements in Mobile IPv4  is defined. This allows a mobile node to decide for itself how many router adver- tisements  agent advertisements  it is ready to miss before declaring its current router unreachable.    The IPv6 destination options permit all Mobile IPv6 control traffic to be piggybacked on any existing IPv6 packets. Mobile IPv4 and its route optimization extensions require separate UDP packets for each control message.  4.5.3.2 Macro Micro-Mobility Extensions to Mobile IP Several protocols and frameworks have been proposed to extend Mobile IP to better support micro- and macro-mobility in next generation wireless cellular environments.  Fast and Scalable Handoffs for Wireless Internetworks This is an extension to Mobile IP [150] that uses hierarchical FAs to handle macro-mobility. This architecture assumes BSs to be network routers; for that reason, it is not compatible with current cellular architectures, where BSs are simply layer 2 forwarding devices. Moreover, deploying a hierarchy of FAs imposes complex operational and security issues  especially in a commercial multiprovider environment  and requires multiple layers of packet processing over the data transport path. The presence of multiple layers of mobility-sup- porting agents also significantly increases the possibility of communication fail- ure, since it does not exploit the inherent robustness of Internet routing protocols.  Mobile-IP Local Registration with Hierarchical Foreign Agents This protocol is an IETF proposal [151], and it solves the issues of triangle rout- ing and inefficient direct routing. The basic mechanism of this architecture   Emerging Technologies for 4G  155  deploys hierarchical FAs for seamless mobility within a domain. During the COA discovery procedure multiple FAs are advertised using the agent advertise- ment message. The COA registration will be provided for the FA that is the low- est common FA ancestor at the two points of attachment of interest. The requirement for hierarchical agents in Internet mobility architecture remains an open issue. Even though it does not appear to be a critical consideration in the immediate future, it is possible that hierarchical mobility management will become more attractive as the IP security infrastructure matures and deploy- ment of mobile multimedia terminals gets much larger.  TeleMIP TeleMIP stands for Telecommunication Enhanced Mobile IP [152]. It achieves smaller handoff latency by localizing the scope of most location update messages within an administrative domain or a geographical region. However, this archi- tecture faces the problem of inefficient home agent notification. TeleMIP intro- duces a new logical entity, called the mobility agent  MA , which provides a mobile node with a stable point of attachment in a foreign network. While the MA is functionally similar to conventional FAs, it is located at a higher level in the network hierarchy than the subnet-specific FAs. Location updates for intradomain mobility are localized only up to the MA. Global location updates are necessary only when the mobile changes the administrative domains. The TeleMIP allows efficient use of public address space, by permitting the use of private addresses for handling macro-mobility. Reduction of the frequency of global update messages overcomes several drawbacks of existing protocols-such as large latencies in location updates, higher probability of loss of binding update messages, and loss of in-flight packets-and thus provides better mobility support for real-time services and applications. The dynamic creation of mobil- ity agents  in TeleMIP  permits the use of load balancing schemes for the effi- cient management of network resources. the potential nonoptimal routing within the domain.  Its drawback is  Wireless IP Network Architecture by TR45.6 Another framework for IP-based mobility management was developed by the Telecommunications Industry Association  TIA  Standards Subcommittee TR45.6 [153] to target 3G cellular wireless systems. This architecture is consis- tent with the requirements set by the ITU for IMT-2000. Therein, solutions are provided to the issue of inefficient direct routing. The framework uses Mobile IP with fast rerouting for global mobility. For macro-mobility, the scheme pro- poses the use of dynamic HAs  DHAs , which reside in the serving network and are dynamically assigned by the visited authentication, authorization, and accouting server. The DHA allows the roaming user to gain service with a local service provider while avoiding unnecessarily long routing. The access   156  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  architecture defines a new node called a packet data-serving node  PDSN   which contains the FA , and uses visitor location register VLR  home location register  HLR   ANSI-41 or GSM-MAP  authentication and authorization information for the access network. The mobile node is identified by a network access identi- fier  NAI  [154] in the visiting or foreign network. Within the registration pro- cess, an MN sends the registration message to the FA, which in turn interacts with an authentication, authorization, and accouting server residing in that net- work or uses the broker network for authentication with the home network.  Micro-Mobility Extensions to Mobile IP Due to the fact that the basic Mobile IP protocol [91] is only concerned with the macro-mobility management, some other solutions are required to enhance the Mobile IP functionality to support micro-mobility. The following overview shows the results of several current research activities in this area.  Wireless Network Extension Using Mobile IP. This micro-mobility management framework [155] is combined with Mobile IP. It provides solutions to the issue of local management of micro-mobility events. The development of this scheme is realized in the Motorola iDEN architecture. Micro-mobility events should be managed more efficiently than macro-mobility events, because they can happen with relatively high frequency. Therefore, the procedures and participants are being kept as local as possible. The micro-mobility procedures are managed by a data gateway, thus achieving the previous condition. The macro-mobility be- tween iDEN subnetworks and other is accomplished by implementing Mobile IPv4 in the FA and HA  Figure 4.14 .  subnetworks  HAWAII. The Handoff-Aware Wireless Access Internet Infrastructure  HA- WAII  [156] proposes a method for using a separate binding protocol to handle micro and macro-mobility. For global mobility, it uses Mobile IP. Using this ar- chitecture, a solution to the issue of local management of micro-mobility events is provided. It uses a two-layer hierarchy for mobility management. When the MN moves into a foreign domain, it is assigned a collocated COA from that do- main, and the MN retains its COA unchanged while moving within the foreign domain. Thus, the movement of the MN within a domain is transparent to the HA. This protocol uses path setup messages to establish and update host-based routing entries for MNs in some specific routers within the domain; other rout- ers not in the path are kept in the dark about the MN’s new COA. When a CN sends packets to a roaming user, it uses the MN home IP address. The HA inter- cepts the packets and sends the encapsulated packet to the MN’s current border router. The border or root router decapsulates and again encapsulates the packet to forward it to either the intermediate router or BS, which decapsulates the packet and finally delivers it to the MN  Figure 4.15 .

Cellular IP [157, 158] proposes an alternative method for provid- ing mobility and handoff support in a cellular network, which consists of inter- connected cellular IP nodes. Solutions to issues like local management of micro-mobility events and seamless intradomain handover are provided.

It is very similar to the host-based routing paradigm of HAWAII. Specifically, Cellular IP provides local mobility  e.g., between BSs in a cellular network   Figure 4.16 .  The architecture uses the home IP address as a unique node identifier, since MN addresses have no location significance inside a cellular IP network. When an MN enters a Cellular IP network, it communicates the local gateway  GW  address to its HA as the COA. Nodes outside the Cellular IP network do not require any enhancements to communicate with nodes inside the network. When a CN sends packets to a roaming user, it uses the MN’s home IP address. As in conventional Mobile IP, the HA intercepts the packets and sends the encapsulated packet to the MN’s current GW. The GW decapsulates the packet and forwards it to the MN’s home address using a node-specific route. Thus, the nodes sending or receiving packets to and from the MN remain unaware of the node location inside the Cellular IP network.  HAWAII and Cellular IP are based on very similar concepts. There is a major difference between them, however. In the HAWAII protocol, most of the intelligence is in the network part, while in Cellular IP most of the intelligence is in the mobile node. Therefore, Cellular IP is not optimal for management of the security and quality of service. However, the network equipment is simpler and therefore cheaper.  4.5.3.3 RSVP Support for Mobile IPv6 The solution for the RSVP operation over IP tunnels is provided for Mobile IPv6 as well [159]. The specification in the draft, proposes three solutions:  Internet  GW  Cellular IP network  BS  BS  BS  MN  BS  MN  GW  Cellular IP network  BS  BS  BS  MN  BS  MN  Figure 4.16 Cellular IP.   Emerging Technologies for 4G  159  1. The first solution requires modifications in RSVP at both mobile and correspondent nodes, so that they have to be aware of Mobile IPv6 addressing.  2a. In order to enhance the performance and make handoffs smooth and seamless, optional triggers objects are added to RSVP messages. The RSVP PATH messages are triggered on bindings updates and home address objects that are contained in RSVP RESV messages. Thus, intermediate routers are enabled to recognize connections and to use resources even when the COA changes.  2b. A flow extension mechanism is provided. This mechanism is able to extend the existing RSVP flows  i.e., flow_ids  that are applied on typical IP routers, to the new Mobile IP router. It is combined with a simultaneous binding option that has to be applied for the roaming mobile node. The mobile node receives packets on both previous and current COA.  To make Mobile IPv6 and RSVP interoperable, the minimal solution  1  is a requirement [159]. This requires the modification and the interfacing of the RSVP daemon and Mobile IP binding cache at both CN and MN.  The latter two solutions  2a or 2b  can provide uninterrupted operation since they support fast reestablishment or preservation of resource reservations when mobile nodes move. Table 4.3 presents a qualitative comparison of the latest two approaches.  It should be noted that triggers objects is a quick solution with low com- plexity, which is able to provide sufficiently good service. The flow extension approach is a little more complex but has the advantage of faster deployment. In multiprovider environments, where the whole end-to-end path could not be controlled, a solution that modifies only CNs, access network routers, and MNs has a big advantage.  4.6 Relays for Next Generation 4G Systems  4.6.1  Introduction  Characteristics of future mobile wireless radio networks will be quite different to those of current networks. Compared to a uniform spatial distribution of, say, voice traffic in a GSM cell, a much more nonuniform traffic will be witnessed in future networks in terms of spatial distribution within the cell of voice and data, in particular with even higher demands for a much broader bandwidth stretch- ing from low to high bit rates for higher mobility. At the same time, the more we move to higher frequencies, the more the range of the cell shrinks compared   160  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  RSVP Support for Mobile IPv6: Qualitative Comparison of Approaches 2a and 2b  Table 4.3  Criteria  Triggers Objects  Flow Extension  Changes to CN Changes to Intermediate Routers Changes to MIP-Router Changes to MN Changes to HA Supports Multicast Delivery Bandwidth efficient  End-to-End Delay  Lossless HO HO Delay Implementation Complexity  Yes  required for minimal solution  Yes  RSVP MIP object extension and reuse of flow’s resources   Yes  required for minimal solution  No  No  forwarding of late packets is also an option here  Yes No Yes  Yes  binding update interception, flow forwarding  Yes No Yes  Yes  it is assumed efficient overprovisioning in the access network  Slightly increased delay  Yes  Always shortest path  but reestablishment of resources requires a round-trip  Yes  with forwarding of late packets  Yes Roundtrip Moderate  Faster Higher  to current systems  e.g., GSM cells . This means that in order to cover the same geographical area, more BSs need to be deployed, which leads to much higher deployment costs for operators. Apart from those new needs, future network deployments will need to solve more adequately the problems that exist in cur- rent conventional network deployments and that are related to the issue of cov- erage; either extend stretch the coverage of cells or provide better coverage in shadowed areas within a cell in terms of, say, better QoS. The above needs requirements will need to be addressed either by new technologies  for instance, new air interface with conventional cellular architectures  or by novel concepts that will introduce new network elements and architectures.  One of those concepts that can address capacity and coverage issues is that of relaying. Relaying has attracted a lot of interest in recent years mainly through research projects of companies and universities, particularly the Wireless World Initiative New Radio  WINNER  project part of the EU IST FP6 [161]  see also Section 5.2.5.2 . Relaying techniques can be classified according to several   Emerging Technologies for 4G  161  standpoints. Analog relaying refers to the simple case where the signal to be repeated is simply amplified and forwarded, possibly with a different frequency  frequency translation . The counterpart is digital relaying, where the signal is fully regenerated before being retransmitted  e.g., decode-and-forward . From a different perspective, fixed or infrastructure relays refer to repeating stations spe- cifically put on fixed locations for that purpose. Relay stations can also be infrastructureless-that is, movable or mobile. The former refers to stations that can be moved to a specific location to help with some temporary requirements of coverage, or mounted on moving vehicles, while the latter refers to the use of other terminals as relaying stations. The relaying operation can be done in two hops, involving a single repeater, or in a truly multihop fashion, with several relaying stations being used. Fixed relaying techniques have been extensively studied  see [162, 163] and the references therein . Mobile relaying is currently being studied in the WINNER project and most of this section will deal with this subject. Mobile relays are effectively fixed-relay logical elements incorporat- ing the mobility factor  see Figure 4.17 .

The main advantages are the plurality of types of mobile relays and the multiple locations where they can be found, which allow the network the opportunity to act on a more ad hoc basis to deal and address more nondeterministic needs.  4.6.2 Mobile Relay Types Deployment Concepts  The first classification of mobile relays  MRs   which can be done with reference to the ownership of the MR  is as follows:    Dedicated mobile relays, with elements being built only for relaying  purposes  Type I II in Figure 4.18 ;    User terminals  UT , which can act additionally as mobile relays  Type  III in Figure 4.18 .  Dedicated MRs are expected to be fitted on top of moving carriers  e.g., cars, ships, trains, or any other vehicle . As such, and with reference to the mobility of those MRs in relation to the mobility of the target area UT popula- tion to cover, dedicated MRs can be split into two further categories:    Dedicated MRs  Type I  to cover the UT population of the carrier on which they are fitted, either on the top or the inside  MR-UT mobility  Mobile relays  Dedicated MRs  User terminals as MRs  "Ownership"  Concept3  User terminals as MR Type III  "Movement"  Concept1  Dedicated MRs Type I  Concept2  Dedicated MRs Type II  High end  Low end  High end  Low end  Complexity  Figure 4.18 Types of mobile relays.   Emerging Technologies for 4G  163  correlated; normally the same   e.g., MR on a train to provide coverage inside the train ;    Dedicated MRs  Type II  to cover UT population outside the carrier they are fitted on  MR-UT mobility uncorrelated   e.g., MR fitted on bus to provide coverage in a park .  Thus,  in Figure 4.18 we present the main classification of MRs, as  described in [164].  4.6.3 Rationale for Mobile Relays  Mobile relays in effect can address the same problems that fixed relays address: coverage and capacity. However, they are envisaged to cover cases that cannot or may not be adequately covered by fixed relays. In that sense fixed and mobile relay can be thought as complementing each other. Thus, the rationale for MR deployment can be summarized in the following points:    To provide a cheaper solution  in terms of CAPEX OPEX backhaul costs  compared either to conventional topologies or fixed relay-based topologies.    To provide coverage in unexpected events where a high concentration of UTs occurs  e.g., road accident traffic jam . Those relays could be fitted on police cars or ambulances.    To provide coverage for events that occur infrequently, but are known of in advance  e.g., a sporting event or concert . It might not be eco- nomically wise to deploy BSs next to a football stadium. In these cases MRs could be reused on demand.    To provide coverage where fixed relays cannot go  e.g., provide cover- age to terminals on top of ships . Thus, we rely on fixed relays, which, on such a carrier, become mobile relays.    To reduce BS power transmission levels  by evenly distributing this power among mobile relays . Thus, we gain in increased capacity in, for example, a CDMA-based interference-limited system.    To reduce the impact on the environment humans. A plethora of GSM BSs and UMTS Node Bs has triggered a lot of controversy and com- plaints from communities and environmental organizations. Thus, through mobile relays we make deployment easier and cheaper  less cost is required to incorporate them on carriers rather than deploy BSs on top of buildings , and we provide less risk for humans in terms of power   164  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  of RF emission, better aesthetical intervention, and less impact to the environment.  4.6.4 Applicability to Environments  Each of the aforementioned types of mobile relays is expected to have different characteristics and capabilities, especially in terms of mobility, complexity, and coverage. We expect them to be applicable or best suited to a number of differ- ent scenarios and environments [164].    Type I: The main characteristics for Type I are high mobility, small coverage, and high complexity. Thus, they are envisaged to be typically applicable to scenarios of wide or rural areas.    Type II: The main characteristics are medium low mobility, medium  large coverage, and medium complexity. Thus, the applicability is towards hotspots and mostly wide area deployments.    Type III: Typical characteristics are low zero mobility, small coverage, and low medium complexity. Thus, they are appropriate for indoors, hotspots, and possibly wide area deployments.  4.6.5 Parallels with Other Technologies  Technologies and concepts similar to the mobile relay concepts have been pro- posed in several fora, for existing and short medium-term to-come systems. Extrapolating from these we can find commonalities in order to highlight the applicability of MR-based concepts on realistic scenarios.    Positioning. A mobile relay in several locations can mimic a BS, which means that certain limitations of, say, using only round-trip time  RTT  Cell Id positioning techniques in isolated sites are overcome and more techniques can be applicable [e.g., RTTs and observed time dif- ference of arrival  OTDOA ]. At the same time, due to the favorable characteristics of the MRs  e.g., shorter range and better channel condi- tions , positioning accuracy is expected to be better compared to the same positioning techniques being applied on larger cells [165].    In 3g Partnership Proejct  3GPP  the concept of repeaters has been pro- posed [166]. It will be interesting to see what type of simple mobile repeaters could be deployed and under what requirements.    Vehicular networks are proposed as part of future networks for the auto- motive industry. Although more of an ad hoc mesh-type networks com- pared to the MR-based hierarchical networks, interesting areas with regard   Emerging Technologies for 4G  165  to interworking of those networks could be investigated. Effectively, MR-based networks could be seen as some kind of higher level layer  in the architecture concept  compared to the vehicular networks and effectively promote interworking between a mesh and a cellular network  e.g., mesh-network with gateway devices communicating with the MRs .   Moving networks. For train companies network operators the need for coverage inside trains is important. Thus, Type I MRs are very applica- ble for these types of deployments, and projects addressing this issue  the Moving Networks concept  are already underway [167].    The concept of opportunity driven multiple access  ODMA , providing coverage through UTs to out-of-coverage UTs, was proposed in 3GPP [168]. It seems that now that networks can support more robust functionalities, faster signaling, ODMA could be extended to the Type III concept.    Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Services. MR-based networks could be simplified if MRs aimed to cover certain types of services. For instance, in the case of MBMS [169], the MRs do not need to maintain dedicated links with the terminals. As such, the whole deployment is much easier to implement. Furthermore, by allocating MBMS for the edge of cell on MRs, we free capacity in the BS.  In order to be able to propose specific solutions, a number of issues need to be resolved like the multiple access  MA  technique  e.g., OFDMA based , the duplex scheme  e.g., TDD , the level of complexity of a mobile relay  layer 1 or layer 2 mobile relays , the number of hops  preferably 2 , routing and forwarding issues, security, signaling issues, types of protocols  e.g., nonstatic protocols, adaptive or feedback based , power control, and connectivity issues. Some of these have already been addressed, but further studies are required [167, 170]. However, in future networks it is envisaged that more complex functionalities and processes could be supported  e.g., faster signaling, higher processing power, shorter delays , which means that mobile relay-based concepts would be more easily supported compared to the point of view we have by looking at their appli- cability on current networks.  4.6.6 Cooperative Mobile Relaying  Cooperative relaying  CR  is another concept within the relaying field. The main idea is to use multiple relays to enhance the received signal in the UT. CR schemes could be seen under the mobile relaying concept, and thus, they give rise to the cooperative mobile relaying  CMR  concept [167]. Again, due to the different types of mobile relays, different levels of applicability exist for CMR   166  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  schemes for a number of scenarios. Specifically, and with reference to the criteria of coverage, velocity, and types of applications, we prioritize the three types of MR with reference to the CMR concept.    For short-type fast applications services, supporting two-hop strategy, Type III MRs are promising in providing CMR. The main advantage is the plurality of terminals in multiple locations out of which we can select the optimum to provide cooperative schemes. The main restric- tions seem to be the frequent positioning, the low computational power, the possible reduction of the user experience  e.g., battery life , and the small coverage, which is, however, compensated by the low zero mobility.    For Type II, the problem is the relatively high mobility  average 40 km h  but this can be compensated by the large coverage of the MR  up to 500m , which means that connectivity will be in general similar to that of Type III. So, these types of MRs could be applicable for more bandwidth-hungry applications services due to the higher complexity incorporated into them.    CMR may not be that applicable for Type I, due to the very good links we assume between MR-BS and MR-UTs, which is the initial reason for applying CMR  i.e., poor links . So, even though CMR could be supported it is not envisaged to be of high incremental gain to the per- formance. However, under a possible MIMO approach  multiply the bit rates by x times  it could be applicable.  4.6.7 Conclusions  Mobile relays have been proposed as part of the relay-based topologies for future network deployments for 4G systems in order to provide better coverage and increased capacity in cellular wireless environments. A number of potential gains can be extracted by the use of mobile relays, as a complementary solution  e.g., on an ad hoc basis  to that of fixed relays. As we have seen, mobile relays pose a number of challenges, mainly those related to the issue of mobility and extending to routing, forwarding, positioning, connectivity, security, and com- plexity. At the same time, though, as we have analyzed, mobile relays could potentially better cover certain needs compared to conventional or fixed relay-based topologies by addressing and incorporating other concepts  e.g., reconfigurability, to be able to cope in several locations for multiple RATs .   Emerging Technologies for 4G  167  4.7 Other Enabling Technologies  Other technologies have been identified as fundamental for allowing the devel- opment of future 4G. We now list some other important techniques and tech- nologies not considered in this chapter: adaptive modulation and coding, techniques for seamless vertical and horizontal handovers, cross-layer design and optimization, multidimensional scheduling  time, frequency, space , techniques for reducing the PAPR problem typical of multicarrier systems, sensor networks, battery technology, and access techniques specifically tailored for short-range communications [171]. The latter techniques have received considerable atten- tion lately. These are basically ultra-wideband  UWB  and optical wireless com- munication techniques. Interested readers are referred to [172, 173] and the references therein for a comprehensive introduction to UWB. The role of opti- cal wireless systems within future 4G communications is discussed in detail in [174]. Optical wireless communications is in fact a very attractive complemen- tary technology that has been extensively considered recently due to its unmatched advantages [175].

Key players in this multiyear development process are manufacturers, academia, wireless operators, service providers, regulatory bodies, and govern- mental agencies, working on their own and in collaborative projects. Currently, many activities are being conducted that aim not only at defining future 4G systems but also at determining the most promising technical solutions for implementing such systems. In this chapter research initiatives and develop- ment work focused on 4G systems are introduced and briefly discussed. First, the scope and goals of the most relevant large-scale research initiatives dealing with 4G will be briefly described. Then, the development work currently being undertaken mainly by industry to develop concrete 4G solutions is described. 4G development work is highly fragmented, and, in general, the work scope of each organization varies greatly, depending on its core business and size. Current efforts can be regarded as being part of a preceding stage to the upcoming 4G standardization process, hence the importance of these activities.  179   180  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  5.2 Major Research Initiatives Focusing on 4G  In this section the most prominent research initiatives on 4G systems are pre- sented. Particularly attention is given to wide-scope multipartner projects aim- ing to achieve a global footprint. Based on the number and size of ongoing projects, and taking into account the number of participating partners, Asia and Europe appear to be more involved in 4G-related research than any other area. In addition to the main initiatives, a list of other important projects is included at the end of this section.  5.2.1 Wireless World Research Forum  Established in 2001 by a number of leading telecom manufacturers, the Wire- less World Research Forum  WWRF  [2] is a nonprofit organization that aims to create a common understanding of visions and key technologies related to future wireless networks. Despite its European origins, the WWRF has suc- ceeded in extending its range of activities and participation into Asia and Amer- ica. With key participating organizations and a membership count exceeding 150, it can be stated with certainty that the WWRF is now the largest research initiative focusing on 4G systems. In addition to heavyweight telecom manufac- tures, numerous IT companies, and a large number of universities from across the globe, network operators, R&D centers, and regulators also participate in this research forum. This gives WWRF an unparalleled strategic weight, not equally found in other initiatives. Given the importance of WWRF, this section will review its organization, views, and deliverables.  In a nutshell, the objectives of WWRF are  1  to generate shared visions on the research directions to follow and  2  to identify, propose, evaluate, and promote technologies likely to become the key building blocks of future wireless communications systems. WWRF can be seen as a consensus-building prestandardization initiative aimed at harmonizing views on future wireless net- works. The initial convergence would pave the way to a more straightforward standardization process once spectrum is allocated by the World Radio Com- munication Conference  WRC  in 2007. The WWRF goals are achieved through individual and joint research activities as well as through open discus- sions, all centered around a number of Working Groups  WG . The main techni- cal working bodies of WWRF consist of six WGs and three Special Interest Groups  SIGs  covering the most relevant areas of future 4G systems. Figure 5.1 illustrates the structure of WWRF and the general outline of the work carried out in each WG and SIG, indicated with a list of related white paper topics.  The work of the WWRF comes from member contributions. These con- tributions are then sorted, edited, and processed, in order to arrive at various deliverables. Current deliverables include:   4G Research Initiatives and Developments  181  Secretariat  Steering Board  Vision Commitee  WWRF Chair  General Assembly  Management Team  Human Perspective and Future Service Concepts  New Radio Interfaces, Relay-Based Systems, Smart Antennas  - Scenarios and analysis - Reference models - User interface technologies and techniques - User centered design process  WP1  Service Architecture  - Terminology - Business models - Personalization - Ambient awarness - Adaptability - Generic service elements - Enabling technologies  WP2  Cooperative and Ad Hoc Networks  - Visions and roadmaps  cooperative networks  - Research challenges and priorities - Architectural principles - Network component technologies for cooperative networks - Ad Hoc networking  WP3  - New air interface technologies: requirements and solutions - Broadband multi-carrier based air interface for future  mobile radio systems  - A mixed OFDM plus single carrier mode air interface - Relay based deployment concepts for wireless and mobile Broadband cellular radio - Smart antennas and related technologies  WP4  Short-Range Wireless Communications Systems  - Ultra wideband - Short- - Short- - The architecture of a mobile internet  range communications range optical wireless communications  WP5  Reconfigurability  - Scenarios, requirements and roadmaps for reconfigurability - Networks supporting functionality for reconfigurability - Network design, resource and spectrum management in reconfigurability context - Element management and reconfigurability protocols, Cognitive radio in reconfigurability context  WP6  -Spectrum for future mobile communications  SIG1  Spectrum topics  SIG2  Security topics  SIG3  Self-organizarion in wireless world systems  Figure 5.1 WWRF structure and main topics  white papers  considered in Working Groups  and Special Interest Groups.  1.

Additionally, there is the all-important human networking that takes place during the regularly spaced meetings. The “Book of Visions” [3] is currently in the process of being updated and republished, and it is likely to be updated on a regular basis thereafter  in line with the further development of new 4G con- cepts and visions .  In an attempt to describe a user-centric wireless world, the WWRF advo- cates the use of a multisphere model [3] where each sphere can be seen as a par- ticular level of interaction in the communication realm. Figure 5.2 illustrates the multisphere concept for future wireless communications systems. The inner- most position in this model is occupied by the user. The surroundings closest to the user, stretching only within the reach of his or her arms and including also the user’s actual body and wearable elements, define the operational environ- ment of a personal area network  PAN , indicated by  1  in Figure 5.2. The user could wear, carry, and hold a number of devices that can communicate not only with each other but also with devices in other spheres of the model. The immedi- ate environment  2  is formed by the familiar elements  e.g., devices with com- munication capabilities  located at a close distance to the user, typically within the user’s room. These elements, home appliances, office tools, and so forth, would be simply, cleverly, and intuitively connected to the user-that is, in an invisible, always-present fashion. Instant partners  3  represent ad hoc associa- tions with other people or complex entities  e.g., vehicles  for interacting, exchanging information, and socialization purposes. In principle, any commu- nication taking place within or between the three first spheres can be classified as short range, owing to the fact that the maximum distances involved are on the order of 1m  1 , 10m  2  and 100m  3 . A number of key techniques are being studied in WWRF in order to provide short-range connectivity, based on radio  e.g., multicarrier systems, UWB  or based on optical wireless communications. The next level in the model covers a wide area and it corresponds then to the radio access  4  sphere. At this level full coverage is provided, including connec- tivity of remote users and connectivity of the lower spheres. WWRF foresees that in addition to conventional radio access technologies  e.g., base stations, satellites  a number of new access techniques will be incorporated. These include base stations in high altitude platforms  HAPS , high-speed local media points for digital broadcasting systems, and other special air interfaces. Based on the above model and definition, one can expect that the number of entities with the potential to be connected  individuals and machines  is virtually beyond mea- sure. The next sphere models the provision of seamless wireless interconnectivity  5 . Given the high degree of heterogeneity of terminals, air interfaces, and net- works, it is likely that adaptive and reconfigurable solutions as well as radio con- vergence layers will be used to ensure ubiquitous and seamless operation. To this   4G Research Initiatives and Developments  183  6  5  4  2  1  1  Personal area network  3  Instant partner  Immediate environment  3  Instant partner  Radio access  3  Instant partner  Inter- connectivity  Cyberworld  @  @  Figure 5.2 The multisphere concept, a reference model for future wireless communication  systems.  end, at the highest level of abstraction, WWRF includes the cyber world in the model  6 . This extension of the real world allows users to interact in an artifi- cially created environment, which it manifests as realistic and appealing. Ubiq- uitous wireless access to the cyber world completes the overall scene envisaged for future communications systems.  WWRF has also identified a number of fundamental building blocks for future wireless communication systems. These are:  1  4G radio interfaces,  2  cooperative networks and terminals,  3  smart antennas and base stations,  4  software defined radio,  5  semantics aware services,  6  end-to-end security and privacy,  7  heterogeneous ad hoc networking, and  8  peer discovery. The work in different WPs and SIGs is basically organized around targets defined by the sphere model and these building blocks.  As mentioned, WWRF is now the largest global initiative focused on future 4G systems. There are many possible reasons why the WWRF is enjoying   184  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  high interest in the current world of wireless technology and why there was a need for this kind of initiative in terms of developing the Forum.  1. Some areas of the wireless industry were showing promising signs  WLAN coming into the home and office , indicating that a newer, different way of working with wireless technology might be emerging, one that would benefit from research investment in the area.  2. Spectrum allocation was, and still is, a lengthy process, and despite the slowdown in the mobile industry, some measures are still needed to ensure the industry does not stagnate altogether.  3. Through technical collaboration and through a united framework, better research results might be expected for future 4G mobile com- munications. Investment risks can be kept to a minimum in such a shared approach since collaboration reduces research costs, a fact that is greatly appreciated in times where there is an apparent recession in the mobile communication sector.  The above reasons give some clues as to why the WWRF is experiencing a  high interest rate.  5.2.2 Mobile IT Forum  Founded in Japan in 2001, the Mobile Information Technology Forum  mITF  [4] is an industry-driven organization looking into future mobile communica- tions systems. It has grown into a sizable association with about 130 members, both from Japan and elsewhere. The mITF’s members profile is oriented mainly to industry, but there is some participation of network operators and service providers. Connection to the local academia is provided through individual members-professors affiliated to key Japanese universities. The core activities are concentrated around the Fourth Generation Mobile Communications Com- mittee and the Mobile Commerce Committee. Figure 5.3 shows the structural organization of the mITF, highlighting the goals and activities of the 4G Mobile Communications Committee [4].  The mITF carries out research and development activities focused on essential aspects of future 4G systems. So far, the most important outcome from mITF is the “Flying Carpet” report [5]. This document approaches future 4G systems from user behavior, society, and industry standpoints. It considers feasi- ble scenarios and features of future systems that match user expectations. Requirements and technical challenges for future systems are identified from the service platform and system infrastructure perspectives. The “Flying Carpet” report also proposes feature and technology roadmaps as well as reference mod- els and concrete proposals for 4G mobile systems. As with the “Book of   4G Research Initiatives and Developments  185  mITF Steering Committee  General Assembly  Open Mobile Alliance Committee  Fourth Generation Mobile Communications Committee  Mobile Commerce Committee  System Subcommittee  Application Subcommittee  Technical Subcommittee  Business Promotion Subcommittee  Objectives: - Facilitate 4G R&D and standardization - targeting a global leadership position - Create mobile business markets 10 - years ahead Near-term activities - Identify feasible system configurations - for 4G systems - Study, identify, and evaluate key - technologies, including:  - UWB techniques - Wireless ad hoc networks - Software defined radio - User oriented application technologies - - Mobile platform technologies  - Interaction with related international organizations - - Identify technical requirements and performance objectives -  term activities  Objectives: - Analyze business schemes for 4G 10 - years ahead - Identify requirements for system models - and required functions contributing to - creating new business markets - Near- - Develop assumptions for 4G - applications - Perform studies and analysis on - content services and business schemes - Study and analyze requests from - society and industry - Compile information from alike organizations -  Figure 5.3 Structure of the mITF.  Visions,” a user-centric approach is adopted here too. In addition, the report targets man-to-man, man-to-machine, and machine-to-machine communica- tions. A concise summary of the “Flying Carpet” outcomes is now presented. In an attempt to create new visions on future user scenarios, some promising set- tings or scenes were identified in this report. These are shown in Figure 5.4  Based on the above scenarios, one can see that 4G mobile systems will be a part of everyday life. User surveys showed a high degree of acceptability to the use of wireless communication systems in these scenarios.

Industry expectations  The study also investigates the industry expectations on future 4G mobile systems. These results, obtained based on applications and business models also developed in the mITF, are summarized in Figure 5.6.   4G Research Initiatives and Developments  187  From the point of view of the required quality for 4G systems, it is agreed that data rate is only one among several important desired characteristics. The most relevant quality indicators are the following:  1  sufficient transmission rate  e.g., 100 Mbps in movement, 1 Gbps in fixed nomadic cases ,  2  certainty and stability of connection,  3  multipoint, interactive real-time communica- tions,  4  provision of flexible communications for diversified service usage,  5  highly secure communications,  6  sufficient storage capacity in terminals  e.g., 100 GB , and  7  low power consumption and high-capacity batteries.  In order to implement future 4G systems the most appropriate or promis- ing technologies have to be identified and further evaluated to validate their suit- ability. The Forum has identified a number of key techniques and technologies with high potential to become essential building blocks for 4G systems. These techniques and technologies, classified into four major categories, are shown below.  1. High-speed and large-capacity wireless transmission techniques:    Frequency refarming: Rearrangement of allocated frequency bands to allow more efficient spectrum utilization and study of new bands.    Advanced adaptive techniques to increase spectral efficiency: Adaptive modulation and coding, adaptive control for automatic repeat re- quest  ARQ , adaptive array antennas.    MIMO techniques for exploiting spatial multiplexing: Fundamental  for attaining very high data throughput.       Multicarrier techniques: Frequency orthogonal techniques  e.g., OFDM  as the baseline modulation technique for 4G systems-used in general in combination with CDMA and TDMA techniques give more design flexibility and interference protection. Interference and fading mitigating techniques: These two major impairments in typical wireless scenarios may cause serious de-gra- dation to systems performance. Interference cancellation, equaliza- tion, and multiantenna techniques, among others, are key approaches to be investigated.    Error control techniques: Advanced FEC and ARQ schemes need to be incorporated to 4G systems to guarantee a desired signal quality regardless of the channel conditions.    High-speed packet radio: Important techniques needed to improve the utilization of radio resources, allowing higher system capacity and higher data rates.    Handover techniques: As seamless communications is one of the fast and reliable  most distinctive features of  future systems,   188  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  handover techniques for a considerable large number of scenarios should be investigated.  2. Network technologies:    Radio access networking techniques: These techniques will enable the dynamic establishment of multiple continuous or isolated access cells.    Robust networks: Variable-capacity networks able to adapt to the variable traffic demand conditions while keeping performance un- changed is a challenging area for research. Multiple antennas, con- gestion control, and multihop communications have been identified as promising techniques for this purpose.    Ad hoc networks: Rather than the centralized approach of conven- tional wireless communications where communications use a cen- tral node  base station  to access the network, an ad hoc network can be seen as a distributed approach where the signal can hop through several nodes  terminals  to reach the destination. Routing protocols, user and service discovery procedures, and security issues are the main research items.    Seamless networking techniques: Allows seamless interconnection of a packet-based backbone network with radio access or other net- works.    Approach link techniques: A number of techniques used to connect base stations or remote stations to control stations by using optical means  fiber, free-space optics , microwaves, and so forth.    High-speed transport technology: Techniques to transport and switch  efficiently very high-speed packet data.  3. Mobile terminal technologies:    Circuit and component technology: Faster processing circuits, denser integration capabilities, smaller batteries, and display technologies with better image quality are identified as important goals to be ful- filled to fully comply with 4G system requirements and user expec- tations.    Battery technology: Enhancement of battery capacity, efficiency, op- erational time, and size is crucial to succeed in producing future handheld terminals. Low-cost batteries and environmentally friendly materials are also very important facts to consider.    Human interface: This is recognized to be a very important research area, where natural ways of interaction between user and machine are of the utmost importance in order to make future 4G systems attractive. Terminal form factor, wearable terminals, visual and   4G Research Initiatives and Developments  189  voice interfaces, and the use of biometric information are among the most important research issues.    Terminal security techniques: Techniques aiming to provide levels of security at least similar to those found in networks using public key-based infrastructure should be developed. User authentication and data protection are also highly relevant research topics.    Terminal software: Common operating systems, software platforms,  and applications compatible with SDR should be developed.    Multisystem wireless terminal technologies: It is envisaged that future terminals will be able to handle seamlessly short-range, wide-area, and broadcast communications using different technologies imple- mented in the terminal. There is a series of technical challenges that need to be solved, including multisystem radio for multiple modu- lations, protocols and frequencies, multiband antennas, practical re- alization of SDR, and seamless operation between the systems.    Software defined radio: Fundamental technology applicable in both base stations and mobile stations permitting the use of multiple ac- cess technologies in a very efficient fashion. Issues to be studied in- clude transceiver architecture, basic implementation technologies, and basic transmitter and receiver technologies realizable in soft- ware, e.g., multimode modulation and demodulation techniques, multiband transmit and receive techniques, and so forth.  4. Mobile systems technologies:    Quality of service: These techniques encompass different methods to control and ensure fundamental communication parameters, like desired transmission speed, bandwidth, delay, and packet loss rate.   Mobility control: Techniques aiming to provide and maintain QoS in environments characterized by mobility. These include hand- overs and mobile Internet protocols.    Mobile multicast techniques: Broadband transmission techniques for  real-time and nonreal-time broadcasting of information.    Location determination and navigation: Reliable techniques for pro- viding user coordinates, speed, and other navigation information in outdoor and indoor scenarios. A large number of applications could potentially exploit this information.    Security, encryption, and authentication: Techniques aiming to se- cure mobile communications by preventing any type of illegal use of the wireless resources.   190  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  5.2.3  Future Technology for Universal Radio Environment Project  The Future Technology for Universal Radio Environment  FuTURE  Project [6, 7] is a government-driven research project in China, part of a major research initiative known as the National High Technology Research and Development Program  or, for short, the 863 Program . It is organized in plans of 5 years length, and FuTURE corresponds to the 2001 to 2005 period. Extensions of the project are already planned. Figure 5.7 shows the plans and goals of the FuTURE Project until 2010, where three planned phases are shown. The target of FuTURE is the development of concrete solutions for future 4G systems. This is done by developing some demonstrative experiments supported by research activities. The long-term goal of the project is to put China in a com- petitive R&D position once standardization and development activities on 4G are started on a global scale.  Members participating in the FuTURE initiative include local R&D units and universities. In addition, an important number of foreign manufacturers take part in the project through local affiliates. The FuTURE Project has liai- sons with WWRF, the European Sixth Framework Program  FP6 , mITF, NGMC  Korea , and other 4G related programs.  The FuTURE Project advocates the use of multiple wireless communica- tions layers, all connected through an IPv6-based core network. At the upper  Goals of each stage  Key technologies: visions, spectrum and technology trends  Candidate proposals: demostration system and applications  Standardization: trials and precommercial systems  FuTURE+  FuTURE  FuTURE II  ITU activities on 4G  2001  2003  2005  Figure 5.7 Stages and goals of the Chinese FuTURE Project  2010 timeline   4G Research Initiatives and Developments  191  level the broadcast layer provides access through a HAPS situated at 10- to 30km altitude. Wide coverage is provided by the cellular layer, seen as an exten- sion and evolution of 3G systems into B3G 4G systems. Finally, area layers pro- vide local coverage access, including wireless local, home, and personal area networks  WLAN, WHAN, WPAN .  The FuTURE Project is organized into the following subprojects:    B3G Radio Access Techniques;   Wireless LAN and Ad Hoc Networks;   Multiple Antenna Environment  MIMO  and RF;   3G-Based Ad Hoc Networking;   IPv6-Based Mobile Core Networks;   Generic Techniques for Mobile Communications;   System Structure, Requirement, and Higher Layer Applications.  The general requirements envisioned by FuTURE for future wireless sys- tems  B3G 4G  are as follows:  1  large dynamic range in data rate, from 10 Kbps to 100 Mbps,  2  high spectral efficiency,  3  packet data as the dominant service,  4  universal use of IP addressing  IP assigned to every possible entity , and  5  low power transmissions and strict compliance of EMC norms.  The project has also identified a number of important research topics and challenges key to the development of future wireless systems. These can be sum- marized as follows:  1  efficient use of space, time, and frequency resources is paramount to achieving targeted performance figures, in particular high data rates, large system capacity, and wide coverage;  2  MIMO systems allow the attainment of large spectral efficiencies  2 to 5 bps Hz and higher  but practical implementation is not straightforward;  3  time division techniques comple- ment well with packet data traffic;  4  space-time coding techniques;  5  devel- opment of turbo receiver concepts;  6  TDMA appears to be an attractive multiple access scheme, possibly used in combination with CDMA and FDMA elements;  7  link adaptation techniques, including adaptive modulation and coding and ARQ schemes; and  8  novel channel coding techniques. Two paral- lel developments are being conducted, differentiated broadly by the employed duplexing scheme. These are organized and managed separately by two different groups of local universities. The time division duplexing  TDD  system consid- ers a TD-MC-CDMA system able to serve both wide and local areas. Target peak data rates are 30 to 50 Mbps and 40 to 100 Mbps, respectively. The frequency division multiplexing  FDD  system, based on generalized multicarrier OFDM techniques, aims to provide wide coverage access with peak data rates of 30 to 50 Mbps.   192  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  5.2.4 Next Generation Mobile Communication Forum  Research activities on B3G systems started in Korea in 2000, fueled initially by the Ministry of Information and Communication  MIC . In 2002 the 4G Mobile Communications Vision Committee was established. At an early stage, the government-funded Electronics and Telecommunications Research Insti- tute  ETRI  was the instrumental organization coordinating 4G research activi- ties in Korea. Today, participating organizations include local and international manufacturers, national universities and operators, and ETRI. In 2003 this Vision Committee was reorganized and structured as a forum, the Next Genera- tion Mobile Communication  NGMC  Forum. A considerable amount of activities related to future 4G systems are carried out in Korea today. From these, probably the most ambitious in terms of scope, size, and international projection is the NGMC Forum [8]. Most of the scope and goals of the NGMC are well in line with those of the WWRF, mITF, and FuTURE initiatives. The most important targets are as follows:  1  analysis of technical and social trends,  2  vision establishment,  3  standardization and international cooperation,  4  advanced R&D strategies steering, and  5  spectrum allocation planning. Figure 5.8 summarizes the NGMC Forum activities and organization. The research activities are carried out by three WGs. Their goals are briefly presented below.  1.

The FP6 sets out the priorities for research, technological development, and demonstration activities for the period 2003 to 2006. The EU-Information Society Technology FP6 has two main stra- tegic objectives:  1. Strengthen the scientific and technological bases of industry. 2. Encourage its international competitiveness while promoting research  activities in support of other EU policies.   194  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  There are a number of activity areas of relevance to the Integrated Projects  IP  that comes under the title of Information Society Technologies. An IP is regarded as an instrument of the FP6. It is a multipartner project to support objective-driven research. The main output deliverable expected of an IP is knowledge for new products, processes, and services. The goals of an IP are expected to be ambitious and to be focused on increasing Europe’s competitive- ness or addressing major societal needs. In order to achieve these ambitious goals, IPs are expected to bring together a large number of partners in order to reach a critical mass. A nonexhaustive list of IPs is given below:  1.

Pervasive Ultra-Wideband Low Spectral Energy Radio Systems   PULSERS   http:  www.pulsers.net .  Two large-scale, broad-scope EU projects are presented below, namely MAGNET and WINNER. These research projects comprehensively explore the two main components of 4G systems: local access  MAGNET and WINNER  and wide coverage access  WINNER . Both projects were started in January 2004. Each of the projects has nearly 40 participating organizations-essentially manufacturers, academia, research laboratories, and small and middle size enter- prises. Partners are predominantly from Europe, but participation from Asia and North America is reasonably high.  5.2.5.1 MAGNET Project The MAGNET project [9], coordinated by the University of Aalborg, Den- mark, is aimed at the development of a new concept based on a user-centric per- sonal communications system. The concept revolves around a personal network   4G Research Initiatives and Developments  195   PN , which supports all of a user’s activities  at home, in the office, away on business  without being obtrusive and ensures that services are delivered in a reliable, secure manner and with good quality of service. A key element of the PN is a PAN also referred to as a personal bubble or “the user’s immediate spa- tial environment.” PANs are linked to each other by  yet to be defined  struc- tures, forming a user’s PN. Devices that do not belong to a user specifically are treated as foreign devices and these may also, under the right conditions, be con- nected into a user’s PAN  and thereby to the user’s PN .  The PNs and PANs are reconfigurable due to their very nature, with con- figuration and connectivity depending on resource availability, time, place, pref- erence, and context.  The MAGNET project does not simply address appropriate radio technol- ogy, it is a complete system design taking into consideration scenarios, business models, PAN architectures, PN architectures, networking and internetworking at both the PAN and PN level, security and privacy, and radio access technolo- gies appropriate for PANs.  Six work packages  WPs  cover the research area. A brief presentation of  each WP is included below.    WP1: User Requirements and Socio-Economic Aspects. In this WP user requirements and scenarios for PN are considered and proposed, based on user-centric approaches.    WP2: Networks and Interworking. This vast WP explores and proposes the following network issues:  1  the role and impact of IPv6 in imple- menting the PN,  2  requirements for PN architecture,  3  resource and service discovery techniques,  4  context discovery techniques,  5  ad hoc self-organizing and routing architectures, and  5  requirements and solutions for naming and addressing in PNs. In addition, PAN inter- faces with infrastructure and active network support for PNs are also considered.    WP3: Adaptive and Scalable Air Interfaces. Adaptive and highly spectra efficient air interface approaches are investigated in this WP. Multicarrier and UWB techniques are considered as the baseline candi- dates for short-range physical layer. In order to evaluate the considered schemes, characterization and modeling of the PAN channel are required.    WP4: Security and Privacy Issues. Efficient approaches for providing  security and privacy to future PANs are investigated in this WP.    WP5: Flexible Platforms and Prototypes. In order to build a demon- the project, software and hardware  the final stage of  strator at   196  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  implementation approaches are studied in this WP, in close coopera- tion with WP3.    WP6: Dissemination and Standardization. This WP takes care of dissemination and standardization activities, including development of the project Web page, cooperation with peer projects and standardiza- tion bodies, market analysis, intellectual property rights policy, and so forth.  5.2.5.2 WINNER Project WINNER [10] is a research consortium coordinated by Siemens and focused on enhancing the performance of mobile communications systems. The WINNER project is aimed at the development of a new concept when looking, in particu- lar, at the radio access part of mobile communications systems. This concept evolves around the expectation that communication systems of the future will converge, which in turn may lead to one global system and fewer unique sys- tems. The project also looks to address the concept of the ubiquitous environ- ment, where technology is embedded around users, enabling them to access information anytime, anyplace, and anywhere, using any device. This is an ambitious goal, particularly if legacy systems are to be taken into account. WINNER will look into radio access adaptability research, where adaptability is seen in the context of multiple scenario adaptation. This implies that the system to be investigated is expected to work across a wide range of environments  short range to long range  and will have the ability to provide multiple services and applications to all users.  In line with the ability to offer increased services and enhanced quality of  service, WINNER seeks to examine radio access technology for achieving:    An increase in peak data rate;   Less delay  improved latency ;   The ability to cope with higher mobile speeds;   More efficient spectrum utilization;   Improved coverage;   Significant improvements in cost per bit  to all mobile players .  Concepts towards achieving the above include the following:   Utilizing advanced and flexible network topologies;   Utilizing advanced and flexible physical layer topologies;   Making use of efficient frequency sharing methods.   4G Research Initiatives and Developments  197  All the above is to be done in a fairly autonomous fashion since the expec-  tation is that the user will not care about the underlying technology.  Two key environments have been identified for the first project phase:  1  short range, and  2  wide area. Characteristics pertaining to the short-range environment include high cell throughput  up to 1 Gbps, indoor and outdoor  and use of multihop concepts to improve coverage and system scalability. Char- acteristics pertaining to the wide-area environment include peak data rates per user of 1 to 100 Mbps, usage in urban, suburban, and rural areas, and the ability to cope with high mobility.  There are seven operational WPs in WINNER. A brief description of  these WPs follows.    WP1: Scenarios. In this WP the user scenarios are defined regardless of any technical consideration. Initial working assumptions are obtained from the different partners. Key motivations and user categories are then used to define the scenario elements.    WP2: Radio Interface. The radio interface is one of the main aspects of the WINNER concept, and it is comprised of leading-edge technolo- gies for the physical layer, MAC, radio data link control, and radio resource management. The air interface is to be capable of working in several different modes. Some important assumptions for the physical layer are as follows:   Multicarrier transmission is assumed for the downlink;   For the uplink several options are to be researched;   With duplex schemes three main areas are to be researched: TDD;  FDD, and hybrid FDD TDD.    WP3: Radio Network Deployment Concepts. In line with the research into a new radio interface is the related area of radio access network research and deployment concepts. The research involves comparison with standard methods to arrive at a concept that enhances capacity and performance, cost, complexity, spectrum efficiency, related EMC prop- erties, and EMF strength. Research in this WP includes mobile and cooperative relaying distributed antenna systems.    WP4: Cooperation of Radio Access Systems. Traditional cellular sys- tems employ but one radio access technology-even if they ultimately link back to common supporting infrastructure or make use of shared infrastructure. Research in this WP goes towards a more integrated approach in terms of providing cooperation between different radio access technologies. Research includes defining cooperative mecha- nisms between WINNER radio access networks and legacy networks,   198  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  identification of information required for handover and radio resource management, and the impact of cooperative mechanisms  on air interface, architecture, and protocols .    WP5: Channel Modeling. Analyzing and selecting existing channel models, determination of propagation scenarios, and channel measure- ments and modeling are the main tasks of this WP.    WP6: Spectrum and Coexistence. Without the availability of spectrum for a system, its future deployment would be difficult to attain. It is therefore necessary to address a methodology for calculating spectrum requirements for input to spectrum licensing bodies. This WP partici- pates and contributes in ITU-R WP 8F. Study items include spectrum range requirements, methodology for estimating spectrum require- ments, requirements for extending existing  e.g., 3G, B3G  systems, efficient sharing methods, flexible spectrum use methods, coexistence, and contributions to the regulatory process.    WP7: System Engineering. Designing any one aspect of a communica- tion system in isolation can be a big mistake. Ensuring that a system’s component modules can be integrated throughout the research, design, build, and test lifecycle is the task of this WP.  5.2.6  The Worldwide Wireless Initiative  The Worldwide Wireless Initiative  WWI  [11] is a joint effort that gathers more than 100 partners from industry, research laboratories, academia, and reg- ulatory agencies. This chiefly European initiative has extended its operational area globally, now incorporating members from America, Asia, and Oceania. WWI contains a series of large Integrated Projects in the FP6 Information Soci- ety Technology. The WWI takes a further step towards developing essential technologies for 4G by creating links among important European projects with the aim to produce highly relevant research proposals and concrete results. The vision of ambient intelligence around the user is advocated by the WWI, where the needs, expectations, and requirements of the user will be supported at all sys- tem levels. One of the objectives of WWI is to define systems and functions that provide the users with the best possible experience at the lowest possible cost of equipment, use, and maintenance.  Research activities were started at the beginning of 2004 and they are planned to span a 6-year period, divided into three 2-year phases. Phase I deals with the initial steps of identifying the baseline technologies and defining the requirements. Three FP6 project will cover this phase: WINNER  new radio interfaces  [10], Ambient Networks  networking  [12], and E2R  end-to-end reconfigurability  [13]. Technology development as well as system definition   4G Research Initiatives and Developments  199  will be considered by Phase II, while Phase III will deal with system synthesis and demonstrations. WWI intends to contribute to standardization activities and regulatory bodies as well.  5.2.7 Samsung 4G Forum  In an attempt to promote the development of 4G technologies worldwide and address the need for creating a consensus among key players, Samsung estab- lished the Samsung 4G Forum in 2003. The driving force behind this forum is the strong belief that industry, operators, academia, and regulatory bodies need to establish a fluid dialog to build sound foundations for future 4G systems through a better mutual understanding. This annual event gathers leading experts from all over the globe to discuss strategic and technical aspects of 4G systems. Every year the forum carries a main theme, reflecting major current issues being considered by the related community. In year 2003 the forum theme was “Global Strategies and New Air Interface Technologies,” whereas in 2004 the main subject of the forum was “Migration Paths Towards 4G Net- works.” In 2005 the theme will be “ R evolution of Radio Access Technology over All-IP Based Networks.” The forum has shown a unique ability to congre- gate key people from companies, universities, and other 4G related parties to exchange their views and strategies. A brief list follows of important issues that appear to be present in most if not all the visions.    4G should be developed around the user and it should not be driven by technology. It should be a user-centric approach where technology is critical but not the goal.    4G cannot be developed in isolation-legacy generations need to be    4G is synonymous with always being connected, anywhere, at any time,  taken into account.  with seamless operation.    The success factors for 4G are services and applications, research in  technology, strategic alliances, and standardization.    Reductions in cost will give 4G the needed thrust for success; cost per  bit and cost of terminals and infrastructure should all be reduced.    Several new services and application models developed around the fore- seen capabilities of future 4G systems show a huge potential for such systems to become widely used.    The task of fulfilling simultaneously all 4G requirements is far from  trivial.    4G could be defined with evolutionary and revolutionary components.   200  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies    4G is a convergence platform: devices, networks, services, and informa-  tion will converge.    4G solutions are approached through new radio technologies and evo-  lution of cellular and local access systems.    A joint common definition of 4G and related terminology is missing.   4G networks will be highly heterogeneous.   Battery technology, particularly power efficiency and capacity volume,  is not evolving as future power hungry devices and applications.  5.2.8  The eMobility Technology Platform  The eMobility Technology Platform [14] is a large-scale initiative aimed to strengthen the European leadership position demonstrated in mobile communi- cation systems  e.g., 2G and 3G systems , paving the way to a similar success in future communication systems. Developing effective technical solutions to cover the whole range of scenarios and capabilities requires an open dialog and extensive collaboration between involved parties. Major European telecommu- nication manufacturers and operators are the main actors behind eMobility. The platform will focus not only on technical solutions but also the on creating a rich environment for developing new services and applications. This initiative can be seen as a European response to the recent successful developments in mobile and wireless communications witnessed in Asia and North America. Europe is planning to invest heavily in order to secure a key position in future communication systems. This is demonstrated by the budget of 2 billion in a period of 2 years, an unparalleled amount by comparable initiatives. The Strate- gic Research Agenda [14] was recently published, offering visions on user experi- ence and acceptance, business infrastructure, services, network and radio technology, security, contents, and so on. The eMobility technology platform envisions a highly integrated and homogeneous network of networks, including wideband wide area systems, fixed wireless access, local access  e.g., WLANs , and personal wireless communications  e.g., PAN and BAN .  5.2.9 Other 4G Research Initiatives  The list of projects presented above, though not exhaustive, embraces key 4G projects. A number of other important projects are briefly presented in this sec- tion. The 4G Mobile Forum  4GMF  [15] is an initiative originating in China but with increasing international presence. WWRF can be seen as a research-ori- ented initiative, while the 4GMF defines itself as a development-oriented forum. The 4GMF is encouraging the development of 4G mobile communica- tions with the so-called Open Wireless Architecture  OWA .   4G Research Initiatives and Developments  201  North America is also active in 4G research activities, although, in general, activities are divided into smaller research projects, each project generally involv- ing a single university or company. IEEE standardization and development activities towards different air interfaces  e.g., IEEE 802 activities  will be dis- cussed in the next section. In the United States the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  DARPA  supports an approach of flexible spectrum allocation. Its neXt Generation  XG  Communications program [16] is developing tech- niques to allow multiple users to share the spectrum through adaptive mecha- nisms that resolve conflicts among users in time, frequency, code, and other domains. DARPA’s goals are to enable a tenfold increase in spectral efficiency. The DARPA program develops technology that is applicable not only to the military but also to civil use as well. The Project Oxygen [17] is a 5-year alliance between the Laboratory for Computer Science  LCS  and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory  AIL  at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  MIT  and a number of major industry leaders. The vision of the project is that in the future, computation and communications will be human centered, and that they shall be freely available everywhere, at any time, like the oxygen in the air. The project identifies a number of high-level challenges for a future communication system. Thus, to support human activities in a natural way, future communication sys- tems should be pervasive  available everywhere , embedded in our world, nomadic, adaptable to user and operating conditions, powerful  yet efficient , intentional  e.g., intuitively close to the user , and eternal  available at any time . A countless number of research projects on 4G related technologies are currently active in companies, universities, and research institutes across North America. These projects, concentrating on essential techniques for future communica- tions systems, are conducted independently, without aiming at consensus build- ing among the research institutions. In that respect, the same trends are found all over Europe and in several Asian nations, where innumerable autonomous projects investigate enabling technologies for future communication systems, in addition to the large-scale initiatives discussed previously in this chapter. In Europe in particular, there are several nationwide research programs with strong affinity toward research in several technical areas of 4G systems. Examples of such initiatives are the FUTURA Project in Finland  Future Radio Access  [18] and the Virtual Centre of Excellence in Mobile and Personal Communications  MVCE  in the United Kingdom [19].  5.3 Paving the Way to 4G: Worldwide Development  In the previous section several 4G research initiatives were introduced and dis- cussed. In parallel to these research oriented activities, development work is cur- rently being carried out by several parties. Such work, though tightly coupled to   202  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  research activities, is more focused on the development and implementation of concrete practical solutions capable of demonstrating particular features of future high-performance systems. It is not the intention of this section to pres- ent a comprehensive overview of all the development work in progress, but rather to introduce a few representative works.  5.3.1 NTT DoCoMo  Japan   DoCoMo has been championing the use of a single radio solution for all envi- ronments. This would certainly bring significant advantages to manufacturers, operators, and end users. In fact, the DoCoMo system supports both cellular and hotspot access using one air interface with different radio parameters. Fre- quency bands below 6 GHz and coverage areas with 500 to 700m cell radius in urban areas and 2 km in suburban or rural areas are being considered. System requirements also include support of around 300-km h mobility targeting high-speed public transportation, such as bullet-trains. Regarding system capac- ity, twice the system spectral efficiency of 3G systems  1 bps Hz  is required without advanced technologies, such as MIMO spatial multiplexing. System bandwidths for downlink and uplink have been assigned asymmetrically. The wireless access techniques adopted for each direction of communication are also different. As will be described in more detail, downlink employs VSF-OFCDM, while uplink uses variable spreading and chip repetition factor CDMA  VSCRF-CDMA . Both CDMA and TDMA are considered as intersite, intersector, and intrasector multiple accesses, even though the details are not specified yet.  The key feature of VSF-OFCDM is the spreading over the two-dimen- sional time-frequency domain. The primary purpose of spreading is to obtain frequency diversity. Due to the very large signal bandwidth  100 MHz  com- pared with the coherence bandwidth in typical conditions, frequency domain scheduling would require large signal bandwidth for uplink control signals. This is because in order to properly address  via feedback  a large amount of subcarriers in a wide bandwidth, the system needs a considerable number of  overhead  bits. For that reason the system exploits frequency diversity  e.g., free of feedback control signals  rather than using frequency domain scheduling. The spreading also offers randomization mitigation of intercell interference. Other merits of using code division multiplexing  CDM  features include, in their terms, easy support of low rate physical channels and flexible resource allocation by simply changing the spreading factors.  For uplink transmission, the VSCRF-CDMA works as follows: First, the input sequence, which would be a coded and symbol mapped complex sequence, is spread with channelization code and scrambled with a long code as usually done in CDMA. Then, a block of chip sequences is repeated such that   4G Research Initiatives and Developments  203  the output has comb-shaped frequency spectrum. Finally, this output is modu- lated with a user-specific phase sequence, for which a set of DFT sequences is commonly used to ensure orthogonality between users. Spreading factor and chip repetition factor are adaptively changed according to the number of simul- taneous access users and radio channel conditions. Originally, the scheme was first introduced in [20] without considering the prespreading.  5.3.2 Samsung’s Terrestrial OFDM Packet Access System  Recently, Samsung proposed a terrestrial OFDMA-based packet access system. The system assumes 2- to 5-GHz frequency band and a scalable system band- width with unit bandwidth of 20 MHz. About 60-Mbps peak data rate can be achieved in 20-MHz bandwidth without MIMO spatial multiplexing. The sys- tem requirement includes higher spectral efficiency than twice the system capac- ity of 3G systems  i.e., higher than 1 bps Hz with frequency reuse of 1  and support of high-speed vehicles, such as KTX, a Korean high-speed rail service with a speed greater than 250 km h . System bandwidths for downlink and uplink have been assigned symmetrically.  One of the merits of using OFDMA is the multiuser diversity gain that can be obtained by means of frequency domain scheduling. This frequency domain scheduling could be considered to be one of key features that differenti- ate the system from the existing 3G wireless systems based on spread spectrum techniques that are mainly targeting frequency diversity. For downlink transmis- sion, the system defines a frame cell  FC  as a finite time-frequency resource consisting of M consecutive subcarriers and N OFDM symbols, to be used as a unit for channel quality feedback, and adaptive modulation and coding. An FC is further divided into multiple subchannels and can be shared by many users. For this purpose, the system specification also defines a time-frequency cell  TFC  consisting of a set of adjacent subcarriers, where the number of subcarriers belonging to a TFC is smaller than M. Moreover, a subchannel is defined as a sequence of hopping TFCs. With this type of structure, the multiuser diversity gain can be traded off with frequency diversity by changing the width of an FC. Note that the frequency domain scheduling requires knowl- edge of the channel quality for each subchannel, and it raises another trade-off between the throughput and the uplink signaling cost. Background study, how- ever, has shown that channel quality feedback for only a few best subchannels are enough to obtain considerable multiuser diversity gain, especially when the number of users in the system is large enough. Note also that the CDM feature is also used within a TFC for interference randomization and mitigation when the system is partially loaded.  For the uplink, a similar structure is used, but without defining an FC, which is equivalent to using only one FC, and the TFCs that comprise a   204  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  subchannel hop over the entire bandwidth. This is basically done to obtain fre- quency diversity only, since in the uplink there is no common pilot channel available. Because each user will use only a portion of the subcarriers, the peak-to-average power ratio  PAPR  problem in the uplink would be less critical than in the downlink transmitter.  5.3.3  The Wireless Broadband Project  Korea has long enjoyed a very high penetration in mobile communications as well as in  wired  wideband Internet usage, with approximate rates of 85% and 60%, respectively  2004 . This has motivated national regulatory bodies, research institutes, manufacturers, and operators to develop a system and create services able to bring to the user, to a limited extent, the best of both worlds. The approach is very appealing, not aiming at extreme mobility or very high data speeds, but instead offering moderate mobility and reasonably high data speeds at relatively low cost. This project started in 2003 and it was initially known as the High-Speed Portable Internet  HPi . Nowadays it bears the name of WiBro  for Wireless Broadband  and it can be considered as a 4G precursor, covering an important midway market segment. When fully operational in 2006, this mobile Internet system will be strategically positioned, complement- ing both the high-speeds and low-mobility of WLAN systems and the high-mobility and low-to-moderate data speeds of cellular systems  e.g., IMT-2000 . Figure 5.9 shows the approximate operating boundaries of WiBro in comparison to other wired and wireless systems.  Briefly, WiBro is defined as a wireless system characterized by moderate mobility  60 km h , moderate data throughput  3 1 Mbps peak in DL UL, respectively  available at any time, anywhere, at low cost. The Ministry of Infor- mation and Communications has reallocated the 2.3-GHz band, once reserved for FWA, to the WiBro initiative.

The Service and Network Working Group deals with the defini- tion of the network and services as well as the definition of the network reference model. The role of the Radio Access Working Group is to define the system parameters and to identify key technical items and the criteria and conditions for their evaluation. In addition, this group will evaluate the candidate propos- als. Two ad hoc groups also support the activities of the WiBro project: the International Coordination and IPR groups. WiBro has established liaisons with the IEEE 802.16 [21] to cooperate in different aspects of the air interface design and standardization.  Key system parameters and requirements have been fixed since January  2004, and they are summarized in Tables 5.1 and 5.2.  The development work of the WiBro system is planned to be carried out between 3Q 2004 and 2Q 2005. After some field trials in the second half of 2005, the service is scheduled to be introduced in the Korean market in the beginning of 2006.  In addition to fulfilling local market needs, the WiBro initiative has an important and strategic value, as it will bridge the two extreme segments of 4G. In terms of penetration, WiBro could gain a large amount of the local wireless data market share, as it aims for data rates and mobility figures high enough to appeal ordinary users. It is expected that by 2010 there will be more than 10 million WiBro users in Korea.  The WiBro system is based on 802.16e [21], especially, with OFDMA mode where a set of subcarriers is defined as a subchannel to be used as a unit for resource allocation and user multiplexing. Basically, the system is a TDD system that easily provides flexible link capacity adjustment for uplink-downlink asym- metry in traffic load. Two different subchannel structures are defined in the WiBro system. A regular subchannel is defined as a set of subcarriers distributed over the entire bandwidth, dubbed the diversity channel, so that one can obtain frequency diversity; while an AMC subchannel is defined as a set of consecutive subcarriers primarily targeting to obtain multiuser diversity by means of fre- quency domain scheduling, much as in the Samsung’s terrestrial OFDM-based packet access system described in Section 5.3.2.

This effort evolved from developments for wired networks  e.g., coaxial cables and twisted pairs  to very high-speed optical fiber-based networks. With the advent of the wireless communications era in the late 1980s, the IEEE 802 standard began to develop standards for wireless networks [28]. This development evolved into a number of distinctive wireless standards, covering WMANs to WLANs to WPANs. The main characteristics of these families of standards will be presented and dis- cussed in this section. The IEEE 802 wireless standards organization is an open forum, where the activities are chiefly carried out by industry and academia rep- resentatives. While technical discussions are the main motivation of the meet- ings, the final decisions are also colored by business and political issues. The scale of the wireless developments and standardization in IEEE 802 can be regarded as global, though its center of mass is clearly North America. Indeed, North America contributes with more than 70% of the overall efforts, whereas Asia and Europe are the most active regions in the rest of the world.   4G Research Initiatives and Developments  207  In terms of coverage, the IEEE 802 wireless standards range from a few meters to several kilometers; they support low to moderate mobility. As with any standard, one of the principal advantages of having a set of worldwide common specifications is the cost reductions resulting from the economy of scale, which will help to develop the markets. Of the various standards currently being devel- oped within IEEE task groups, the IEEE 802.11 [22]  Wireless Local Area Net- work, WLAN  and IEEE 802.16 [21]  Wireless Metropolitan Area Network, WMAN  are perhaps the ones attracting the highest share of participation. Compared with 2 3G cellular systems that support communications in a high-speed mobile environment while being able to provide only low medium spectral efficiency and link capacity, these systems can provide higher efficiency and capacity in fixed nomadic environments. Recently, the task groups are try- ing to evolve the previous versions to further improve link capacity and or to provide more mobility. These activities aim to position these standards as a pre-4G solution. The most 4G relevant IEEE 802 wireless standards are briefly presented next.  IEEE 802.11 The IEEE 802.11 standard [22] can be considered as the WLAN standard par excellence, providing seamless wireless access within the home, office building, and public spaces. This standard defines ad hoc and infrastructure-based network configurations that exploit the unlicensed Industrial, Scientific and Medical  ISM  bands. Several physical layers are defined in this standard. The plain 802.11 initially defined two radio and one infrared  IR  physical layers. The radio-based link uses the 2.4-GHz frequency band and is based either on direct sequence or frequency hopping spread spectrum techniques. A maximum data throughput of 2 Mbps is achievable in each case. Several evolution versions were later developed supporting higher data rates e.g., 802.11b  maximum data rate of 11 Mbps , 802.11a and 803.11g  up to 54 Mbps  and IEEE 802.11n  up to several hundred megabytes per second .  IEEE 802.15 The IEEE 802.15 standard [23] is a short-range wireless communication stan- dard supporting WPANs. This standard advocates the use of low-power, low-cost, and small-size networks to provide communications within the operat- ing space surrounding a user. Originally this standard followed closely the Bluetooth [24] specifications. This low-rate standard was initially conceived to provide connectivity to a variety of handheld and portable devices like PDAs and notebook computers, as well as peripherals and other electronic equipment. A high-speed WPAN was then developed within the framework of IEEE 802.15.3 providing up to 55 Mbps of data throughput in a range of less than 10m. These networks operate in the unlicensed 2.4-GHz frequency band. The   208  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  IEEE 802.15.4 specifies a simple, low-cost, very low-power WPAN and low transfer speeds  20 to 250 Kbps  aimed at wireless personal area and device-to-device networking. Basically, this standard provides wireless connec- tivity to sensors and actuators, supporting in general tasks of monitoring and control. ZigBee [25] is a parallel standard, sharing the physical layer with 802.15.4 and providing enhancements in higher layers.  IEEE 802.16 The IEEE 802.16 standard [21, 29] specifies a broadband wireless access  BWA  specifically for metropolitan area networks  MANs . Initially the IEEE 802.16 standard addressed the fixed wireless markets  i.e., fixed BWA, also known as wireless local loop  WLL  , aiming to replace with a wireless access the existing wired broadband connections to the core network  e.g., cable modems, DSL, T1 E1 wired access . More recently, the IEEE 802.16 standard has also focused on mobile BWA, concentrating mainly on low-to-moderate mobility subscribers requiring high-speed connections. The 802.16 standard encom- passes both licensed and license-exempted bands and exploits single and multicarrier techniques. A large number of industrial partners  more than 200 in 2005  who support its current version  IEEE802.16e  have formed a consor- tium, the WiMAX  for Wireless Microwave Access  [26], aiming to promote and certify compatibility and interoperability of products complying with the 802.16 specifications. In Korea, the WiBro system is due to be deployed in 2005 and ready to provide services from mid-2006. Based on the IEEE 802.16e technology, WiBro will provide up to 1-Mbps-connectivity mobile terminals, with velocities of up to 60 km h.  IEEE 802.20 The IEEE 802.20 standard [27] is a mobile broadband wireless access  MBWA  standard enabling worldwide deployment of affordable, ubiquitous, always-on, and interoperable multivendor mobile broadband wireless access networks that meet the needs of business and residential end-user markets. The low-latency air interface is designed specifically for packet transfer, and it is optimized for IP-based services, supporting peak data rates exceeding 1 Mbps. The 802.20 standard operates in the licensed bands below 3.5 GHz. Wide coverage, with cell sizes of 15 km or larger and high mobility are also supported.  5.4 Discussions and Conclusion  This chapter has reviewed the major 4G research and development activities on a worldwide scale. Asia appears to be perhaps slightly more active, although Europe and America are also heavily involved. As already discussed in Chapter   4G Research Initiatives and Developments  209  2, 4G defines several operating scenarios  e.g., fixed, nomadic, mobile  with associated communication capabilities  e.g., low-, mid-, and high-data rates . The research and development work currently in progress covers all these areas. However, the efforts are notoriously fragmented, both industry and technol- ogy-wise. Industry is approaching 4G by following several paths, and this will result in several complementary and competing technologies. WWRF is cer- tainly the largest consensus building force, and it has already demonstrated that there exists a basic understanding of 4G among industry and academia across the world. WWRF has identified promising operating scenarios as well as suit- able technical solutions with potential to become the key building blocks of 4G. In principle, these visions are shared by the majority of the mobile communica- tions industry. Other important  regional  research initiatives  e.g., in China, Japan, and Korea  primarily attempt to fulfill the needs of local markets, though they may also have ambitions to reach other regions. Europe appears to be well organized in terms of a few large-scale research projects and a large number of smaller complementary projects. In general all the aforementioned research ini- tiatives consider wide access  e.g., cellular  and local access as the main constitu- ents of 4G, with different technical solutions in each case. On the cellular side, there seems to be an understanding that conventional architectures may not be enough to guarantee wide coverage and high-data rates. New network configu- rations are being studied by these initiatives, particularly multihop cellular sys- tems  e.g., typically two-hop or relaying systems  and to a lesser extent, distributed radio approaches. As for the local area, there are several concepts being considered. Sometimes these can be regarded as complementary systems for short-range communications  e.g., PAN, WLAN, MAN . Different compet- ing technologies are being studied  e.g., single and multicarrier, UWB, optical . Most initiatives identify multiantenna systems as one of the fundamental enabling technologies for 4G, in both cellular and local access approaches. This aspect is also seen in the development front, where most, if not all systems being designed or already demonstrated, exploit multiples antennas.  Several challenges can be mentioned. Assuming that several technologies dominate on the 4G horizon, the integration of several networks into one monolithic network that assures a transparent and seamless experience to the user is an intricate task. In many cases the initiatives concentrate only in isolated technical areas rather than the integration of heterogeneous technologies. Also, the practical scenarios and future services already identified and being used as the blueprint for the technical development have not been deeply explored nor validated. Furthermore, their applicability cannot be assumed to be universal. This may lead to risky situations as the technical solutions investigated by ongo- ing research and development efforts try to match the demands raised from sev- eral assumed scenarios and services. Another point of conflict is the fact that the supported technologies and schedules for adoption and launching of the   210  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  technology are somewhat different in different regions of the world, with Asia pushing for launching 4G around 2010 and Europe considering 2015 or later.  Since 4G is expected to have a highly integrative role, embracing virtually all possible combinations of scenarios and capabilities, the early signs of frag- mentation should not necessarily be seen as discouraging, nor necessarily having any negative connotation. Rather, the fact that recent history is repeating  e.g., global technology breakup in 2G, 3G  is once again a clear indication that tech- nology is just one part of the wireless communications picture. To a great extent, political aspects and economic interests are likely to have a decisive impact on the technical solutions being adopted for future 4G wireless commu- nication systems. Even though a universal solution applicable in all scenarios is proposed, the chances for such a concept to become the de facto single 4G solu- tion seem to be small, mainly because of the several and nonaligned interests governing the wireless communications arena. The ITU-R Framework Recom- mendation M.1645 defines a broad range of operating scenarios and capabilities  see Figure 2.12 in Chapter 2  for these systems. Given the supported variety of scenarios and capabilities, and taking into account the number and nature of the players implicated in 4G, it is likely that the number of proponent technologies and solutions will be initially large, as can already be seen. Attention should be paid to further harmonizing this prestandardization work, aiming to achieve wide consensus on a few promising constituent technologies.

The critical success factors for future 4G terminals are service convergence, user-centric interface, and portable intelligence, as shown in Figure 6.1. Service convergence is important not only in the sense of a terminal’s ability to support multiples ser- vices, some of then concurrently, but also from the standpoint that many services  Market  Critical success factor  Various product portfolio  Imaging rich media  Business  smart phone   Service convergence  User centric interface  Portable intelligence    Convergence; wireless  cid:127  and wired,  cid:127  telecommunications and  cid:127  broacasting  cid:127  Seamless connectivity  cid:127  Ubiquitous   cid:127  Provide various features  cid:127  with convenience and  cid:127  fun  cid:127  Universal design of H W  cid:127  and S W  cid:127  Recognition technology; voice, text, context, etc.  cid:127    cid:127  Portability with various  cid:127  functions to support digital convergence  cid:127   Figure 6.1 Critical success factors for future terminals.  213   214  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  from different providers will have to be compatible with a large variety of termi- nals with different capabilities. We already experience the convergence of various multimedia and interactive services, such as mobile Internet services, multimedia messaging services, and digital multimedia broadcasting  DMB . Concrete exam- ples include: sending short messaging services  SMS  to broadcasters while watching TV on a mobile terminal; voting or any other user interaction on the move during a broadcasted program; and interactive Internet shopping for an object appearing in a MPEG4 movie. As convergence of services and supporting technologies becomes more and more important, the seamless connectivity among these services and technologies becomes crucial. Moreover, as mobile ter- minals become more complex, it is expected that convenient features aimed at enhancing their usability will emerge-for example, advance recognition technolo- gies and user friendly interfaces. Like the whole 4G concept, terminals must also be designed around the user. A user-centric interface is the first step to fulfill this requirement. Advanced multifunction terminals  and their counterpart services  will not appeal to users if manufacturers  and service developers  ignore friendly and intuitive user interfaces. These requirements must be added to mobile termi- nals while maintaining portability, which is an inherent characteristic of a mobile terminal. In terms of markets, there is no single terminal capable of fulfilling the need of all users. Indeed, different user segments have different needs, and hence, more than ever can one expect diversity in mobile terminals, such as devices intended for entertainment, information access, and business. It follows that vari- ous terminals reflecting the above mentioned critical success factors should be developed. For example, general-purpose terminals targeting the horizontal mar- ket need to support imaging and rich media for entertainment. Furthermore, the vertical market will be driven by specialized devices such as smart-phones with business applications like Personal Information Management System  PIMS  and office functions, or embedded terminals for logistics.  6.2 Multimode  All-in-One  Versus Single Purpose Terminals  When we look at the evolution of mobile terminals, we notice that two basic design philosophies are widely accepted. One philosophy aims at multimode ter- minals, where a variety of different functionalities are supported. The other approach targets single-mode terminals, where basic telephony functions are sup- ported. Most people feel that users should be able to experience various content, such as music and video, beyond simple telephony through one terminal with multifunctionality. Such characteristics can be seen as fulfilling the changing and somewhat difficult-to-predict needs of an important user segment, the younger generation. However, there does seem to be another important market with less inclination to use such an array of functions; this group is rather   4G Terminals  215  satisfied with simple devices equipped only with a minimum amount of essential functions. Thus, one may argue that simpler terminals should be still in the market even if they have as few multimedia functions as possible.  Market trends and fierce competition among manufacturers are mani- fested as an ever-increasing tendency to incorporate more functionality within terminals. Even though some users would be satisfied with simple mobile termi- nals, they may end up purchasing devices with imaging and or music reproduc- tion capabilities incorporated  e.g., built-in camera, MP3 player  simply because those multifunctional  or multimedia  phones are being offered. Note that man- ufacturers are directly or indirectly starting to support multimode terminals, as this approach could become a very effective way of differentiating from their competitors. In fact, in terms of business market, as the mobile market grows rapidly and the distinction between vendors in technology fade, vendors will focus on the development of multifunctional terminals, possibly combined with aggressive branding, as an effective method for distinguishing from other products.  As time goes by, mobile subscribers will be able to communicate at any time by voice, video, or text messaging, and will be able to obtain various kinds of information and enjoy rich multimedia content. Vast amounts of rich con- tent are already available in the domain of fixed Internet, and these can be also accessed from the mobile network. Dedicated content that matches the needs of users on the move will increasingly be added. The availability of multimedia content and their easy access will foster the development of multifunctional terminals.  The introduction of multifunctional mobile terminals has been accompa- nied by a rapid evolution in support for multimedia. The real driver originates from audio and imaging applications made popular through other devices [e.g., MP3 players, portable multimedia player  PMP , and Garmin’s GPS receiver] and through advancements in technology that allow for cost-effective miniatur- ization. It comes as no surprise that the mobile phone is the most adequate device for multimedia on the go.  The new generation of mobile phones should be designed taking into account user needs, market trends, and technology evolution. Market trends are difficult to predict, because users, operators, terminal manufacturers, and the state of local and global economies, as well as many other factors, have a big impact on how the markets will develop. Since the user is the final consumer in the terminal market chain, it is precisely the user who ultimately the manufac- turer should listen to when it comes to designing future terminals. Diverse enabling technologies such as semiconductor technology for ASICs, memory and processors, displays, built-in cameras, batteries, algorithms, and coding formats, are just means to implement the terminals, and they remain unknown to the user.   216  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  Large and bright color displays have become a strong selling point for mobile phones, and emerging features and services make excellent use of them, for instance, graphical user interfaces  GUI , imaging, browsing, and gaming. The display is one of the most expensive components in a phone. Display tech- nology is rapidly evolving and the QVGA displays  320 × 240-pixel resolution  introduced in phones in 2003 will become commonplace in 2005 and 2006.  Also, in a few years built-in cameras supporting still and video imaging will became a must-have feature in mobile phones. As costs continue to fall, many of the standard features associated with original digital still cameras will show up in the mainstream mobile phones-for example, several megapixel sen- sors, flash, auto-focus, and optical zoom. The added value here, as compared with conventional digital cameras, is the possibility to transfer images straight away by the same device.  In the audio domain, audio codecs such as MP3, advanced audio coding  AAC , RealAudio  RA , and Windows Media Audio  WMA  will be played in the terminal. Most of the current generation phones support stereo headsets, and recently phones with stereo speakers were introduced.  A new voice service, Push-to-Talk over Cellular  PoC  and Push-to-Multi- media, is based on IP transmission of the voice signal without using a cir- cuit-switched connection. A PoC resembles a walkie-talkie type of service that connects multiple users just by pushing a button. As this trend continues, we may see services like full-duplex voice over IP  VoIP  and multiple voice sessions over IP in the market.  Mobile phones in the market appear to follow the trend that more and more features and functionalities will be added-phones, digital cameras, music and video players, digital TV, gaming consoles, positioning, messaging clients, and PDAs. The mobile phone hardware and software will thus become increas- ingly more complex. Obviously, to be successful in future mobile markets, man- ufacturers need solid and flexible hardware and software platform architectures.  6.3  Future Terminals and Technology  In the previous section two approaches to 4G terminals were discussed: sin- gle-mode versus multimode  multiple functions  terminals. At this point it appears impossible to predict if any of these two approaches will emerge as the predominant one. Based on the present situation one could argue that both approaches could share the market. However, it should be kept in mind that one of the driving forces of future wireless communication systems is their capability to effectively handle multimedia type of information and the related services and applications, and hence, flexible, multipurpose devices seem to be the most promising candidates to become the mainstream terminal of the future.   4G Terminals  217  Terminals will come in many shapes, sizes, and capabilities in the 4G world. Heterogeneity may be the key word that best describes the realm of 4G terminals. Some will be inexpensive, simple, and with very basic communications capabili- ties; others will be advanced and expensive, boasting truly high data throughputs. For illustrative purposes, Figure 6.2 shows the broad range of ter- minals for 4G and their principal characteristics [3]. As can be observed, in the context of 4G, terminals refer not only to the conventional mobile  or portable  phones but also to an array of very different and capable devices. Figure 6.2 includes nonconventional devices that can be thought of as terminals, just by the fact that a communication enabling transceiver is integrated to those devices, and also because other related functions may also be incorporated  IP address, display, etc.   Demands on flexibility, adaptability, user friendliness, operational time, and radiation levels are driving the development [2]. In this sense, 4G terminals will require more developed features than the existing terminals, including highperformance, multifunction, internetworking capability, wide bandwidth, miniaturization, and others, as summarized in Figure 6.3.  low-power consumption,  Next, a list of the expected basic requirements of hardware and software  technologies for the 4G terminals is presented.  Hardware    Multimedia;   Modem, processor: enhancing processing power, embedding applica-  tion processor;    Display, camera,  storage, battery: all  requiring high-quality and  high-performance because of the rich-media services;    Flexibility to various environments;  Performance  processing power, memory, storage space, battery life   Screen size  Size weight portability  Bandwidth requirements  Networks supported  Figure 6.2 Broad range of heterogeneous terminals for 4G.

Software    General purpose, flexible;   Connectivity protocol:  seamless connectivity among W-CDMA,  CDMA, WLAN, Bluetooth, and WiBro;    Middleware: wider acceptance of middleware platform, such as Java  and Brew;   4G Terminals  219    Operating system  OS , codec: open OS  Symbian, WinCE, Palm  and  general purpose Codec  H.264 ;    Standardization is very competitive;   Middleware: Java versus Brew;   OS, codec: Symbian versus MS, H.264 versus MPEG4, MP3 versus  AAC WMA.  Markets are expected to evolve from network-centric environments towards terminal-centric environments. In other words, so far the critical issues have been how to provide and deploy a high-speed network with QoS support to the end user. These considerations are solved by broadband network technol- ogies like 3G and WiBro. Once the problem of providing network connectivity in several environments is solved, the next challenge is to bring various broad- band multimedia services and applications into the mobile terminal. The service provided by a network will often be determined by the capabilities of the termi- nal being carried by the user. Basic and simple terminals will support basic and simple services and vice versa. The same services but with upgraded capabilities could be supported by advanced terminals  e.g., higher resolution due to better and bigger displays and higher computational power . As pointed out, terminals could also be used for many new purposes, including functions like MP3 player, radio receiver, TV receiver, camera, remote control, data storage, and position- ing. Also, various software platforms for mobile terminals are already in use or expected to be used in the future, such as JAVA, Symbian, Microsoft Windows, and Linux. The terminals will have similar applications to those found in PCs, but more and more often third parties will provide applications that use the ter- minal as a platform for many new purposes. This evolution requires that the programming languages used in the terminals can use most of the functionalities that the terminal possesses  i.e., more interfaces . Another challenging issue is the interoperability of applications and services in terminals that have different capabilities  display resolution, processing power , operating systems, and soft- ware platforms. It is likely that there will be many competing operating systems in the terminals at first, but eventually only a few will have a leading role in the markets. Figure 6.4 [1] presents an overview of hardware evolution and technology development for future terminals.  The user interface evolution consists of displays, multimodal interfaces, and standard applications, such as user positioning  e.g., GPS , camera, and bio- metric identification. Multimodal interfaces for man-machine communication can be regarded as one of the key technologies, as they determine the appearance and interaction of a device or application and will be optional to keyboard and mouse. Pen, speech, and gesture-based operation interfaces will become increas- ingly common in mobile consumer terminals.   220  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  Past now  Future vision  Network centricity  Terminal centricity  BIW displays  Color displays  3D displays  Nonrigid displays  Extra features  e.g. headphones, FM radio   BIW displays  Camera  Open platforms: Symbian JAVA  MS Linux  One access  e.g. GSM, CDMA   Applications provided by third parties Multiaccess  e.g., 2G, 3G, WLAN, short range, DVB-H   Sensors in terminals - noise, compass, acceleration, proximity  Communication with other devices  e.g., other terminals, home applicances sensors, actuators, e.g., NFC, RFID   Parallel radio multiaccess  One modality  Several modalities  e.g., keys, voice   Multimodal, natural interfaces  One antenna  Sector antennas  MIMO in BS Smart antenna array in BS  MIMO on MT and BS Smart antenna in MT BS  NiCd batteries  Li-ion batteries  DMFC fuel cells  New advanced fuel cells  Contextual, sensing mobile terminal  Figure 6.4 Mobile terminal technology.  From: [1].   At present, terminals are only capable of accessing one network at a time and a terminal is capable of switching a radio network among some standards, like GSM, UMTS, CDMA, WLAN, and WiMAX. Parallel radio or multiple simultaneous access technologies will allow access to different radio networks at the same time. For instance, one can be connected to the cellular network engaged in a voce service while simultaneously retrieving information from a WLAN. Antenna evolution promises increased throughput and more optimal utilization of bandwidth using MIMO-capable base stations and mobile termi- nals. Terminals will be able to communicate with a large number of other devices using different techniques  e.g., radio and optical interfaces  [4]. Many types of sensors will be embedded in future devices to allow control of applications and to sense the current user context.  It is expected that future terminals will have higher power consumption due to the new high-speed multimedia applications, the multiple radio inter- faces that could be used simultaneously, the increased processing power required by broadband multimedia-optimized terminals, and the use of multiple anten- nas and large displays. To get an insight of the power requirements of mobile phones, a typical 2G terminal needs typically about 10 MIPS  Million Instruc- tions Per Second , while a 3G terminal may require a few 100 MIPS. It is expected that 4G terminals may require a computational power of one or two orders of magnitudes higher that their 3G counterparts. Unfortunately, higher MIPS means higher power drain. In terms of power volume, today’s battery technology is not sufficient to power the devices foreseen for the future. This is   4G Terminals  221  an issue that could become critical and eventually it could hinder the develop- ment of 4G terminals. A very advanced high-performance terminal will be far less appealing to users if its operational time is very short or if it has to be pow- ered by bulky and heavy batteries, despite all of its capabilities. Low-temperature fuel cells, such as the direct methanol fuel cell  DMFC , appear to be a promis- ing solution for replacing conventional rechargeable batteries and solving this challenge, though technical developments in this area move at a much slower pace than in other technology fields related to 4G terminals. Even if the power issue is solved, however, another critical issue is the extensive heat production and necessary cooling for handheld terminals [3]. Battery technology is a funda- mental area that could slow down the development of truly advanced terminals.  6.3.1 Hardware Technology Roadmap  A hardware technology roadmap is shown in Figure 6.5. Several key hard- ware-related components and technologies are discussed next.  Modem As the need for processing power is increased, the competition between inte- grated single-chip architecture and functionally divided multichip architecture will become more pronounced. Single-chip architecture has the advantages of requiring less size and in some situations lower power consumption. On the other hand, multichip architecture is powerful in processing multimedia appli- cations. Some studies show that by distributing processing power, a significant reduction in power consumption can be attained. There is no clear rule that shows which approach is the best, and in practice, particular cases should be evaluated individually. Also, the need of fixed  e.g., ASICs  or flexible  e.g., reconfigurable  structures has to be assessed carefully when designing the plat- forms for implementing the modem. Cost and space limitations also need to be taken into account when considering single and multichip architectures.  Radio Technology Terminal architecture will be designed by means of a modular structure integrating various functions and radio access technologies in small-size mobile terminals. New advanced technology shall be developed to support multiband multimode like W-CDMA, EV-DV, HSDPA, DMB, WLAN, WiBro, and so forth. SDR and multiantenna technologies will become the core technologies, offering flexibility to the changing radio environments and high performance.  In particular, SDR enables easier expansion of base station facilities, flexi- ble reconfiguration of air interfaces, and terminals to support multiple stan- dards. The flexibility offered by this technology is paramount to make possible   222  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  m e d o m G N   cid:127     r o s s e c o r p  l  a r e n e g    P S D + e r o c  l  a u D  cid:127      m e d o M + F R    i  p h c - e n O  cid:127   i  p h C F R d n a b i t l u M     l    ~ e x i p M 5   S O M C  cid:127   n o i t c n u f C S D  l l  u F  cid:127     s B G     D N A N   cid:127      M A R M M A R F  cid:127   m a r g o o h  l  ,  n o i t c e o r P  cid:127   j  i  d n e h g h R O N   cid:127   t u O - d e e W    l e x i p M 5 ~ 3   S O M C  cid:127   t u O - d e e W D C C  cid:127      B G 1 ~ 5 . 0    D N A N   cid:127   l  y a p s i d e b i x e l F  cid:127   l  % 0 5 : t o S  l  l  a n r e t x E  cid:127   C M M  ,  D S  cid:127   % 5 2 : t o l s l  a n r e t x E  cid:127   C M M  ,  D S  cid:127     h A m 0 0 8 1 ~ 0 0 4 1   P - i L  cid:127     h A m 0 0 0 6 ~ 0 0 0 3    l  e u F  cid:127     h A m 0 0 5 1 ~ 0 0 2 1   P - i L  cid:127     h A m 0 0 2 1 ~ 0 0 0 1   n o I - i L  cid:127     h A m 0 0 0 1 ~ 0 0 8   n o I - i L  cid:127   l l  e c  l  e u F  cid:127     h A m 0 0 2 1 ~ 0 0 0 1   P - i L  cid:127     h A m 0 0 0 1 ~ 0 0 8   P - i L  cid:127      A G V  ,  e u r T  , “ 3 ~ 6 . 2    D E L O  cid:127   l  y a p s i d n a M  i  :  D E L O  cid:127      A G V  ,  e u r T  , “ 3 ~ 4 . 2   T F T  cid:127      A G V Q  , k 0 6 2 , “ 4 . 2 ~ 0 . 2   T F T  cid:127   l  y a p s i D  e c i v e d O    I  F R e n o n  i  l l  A  cid:127   x R   x T e t a r a p e S  cid:127   l  y g o o n h c e t o d a R  i     B M 4 6 ~ 2 3   R O N   cid:127      B M 6 5 2 ~ 8 2 1    D N A N   cid:127     l e x i p M 4 ~ 2   S O M C  cid:127   ? l e x i p M  :  S O M C  cid:127     l e x i p M 4 ~ 2   D C C  cid:127     l e x i p M 2 ~ 1   D C C  cid:127   % 6 : t o l s l  a n r e t x E  cid:127   C M M  ,  D S  cid:127      B M 2 3 ~ 6 1   R O N   cid:127      B M 4 6 ~ 2 3    D N A N   cid:127   d e d d e b m E  e g a r o t s  l  a n r e t x E  e g a r o t s  y r e t t a B  a r e m a C  e g a r o t S  y r e t t a b  d n a  .  p a m d a o r  l  y g o o n h c e t e r a w d r a H  5  .  6 e r u g i F  0 1 0 2  9 0 0 2  8 0 0 2  7 0 0 2  6 0 0 2  5 0 0 2  4 0 0 2  e r u t c u r t s P S D + e r o c  l  a u D  1 1 M R A + 9 M R A  cid:127     z H G 1 ~ z H M 0 0 4    e r u t c u r t s P S D + e r o c e g n S  l  i    z H M 0 5 1    9 M R A  cid:127   % 8 :  n i - t l i  u b P A  cid:127   % 5 :  n i - t l i  u b P A  cid:127   % 3 :  n  i  t l i  u b P A  cid:127   r o s s e c o r p n o i t a c  i l  p p A  m e d o M   4G Terminals  223  truly seamless networks and to support multiple communication schemes. It also provides an effective means for expanding functions for multimode opera- tions, as terminals can be reconfigured in the field. The changes of terminal fea- tures can be carried out even without users being aware of them through software download [5]. In addition, multiple antennas at both ends of the wire- less channel can be used to increase the data rate via spatial multiplexing and to improve the link quality through diversity. The integration of multiple antennas into mobiles will result in many very attractive features.  I O Devices The display will be an important part of a 4G terminal in providing multimedia services in the ubiquitous environment and in offering a realistic and vivid expe- rience exploiting a high-definition imaging capable device. Various types of dis- plays like flexible displays, micro displays, and hologram-based devices will also be developed for various service environments. Portability is a key factor for a mobile terminal and current technologies like multiple key presses or touch screen are not necessarily comfortable and easy-to-use input devices. In the future, more convenient and easy-to-use keypads will be required and, exter- nal virtual keyboard as well as intelligent text-input will be spotlighted. Image sensors, microphones, and other sensors, through advanced gesture, voice, and movement recognition, will also be considered as input devices.  Storage and Battery The multimedia capabilities in phones and camera phones are speeding up the development of storage, such as flash memory, micro-hard-disk drives  HDD , and external memory cards. In the near future, solid-state devices like NOR flash memories will be in the mainstream with low cost and large capacities. Indeed, capacity on the order of several gigabytes will be built-in onboard the mobile terminal to support rich-media contents. Battery technology is one of the necessary key technologies for realizing such appealing mobile communica- tions terminals. The technical challenges in this area include the enhancement of battery capacity, power efficiency, operational hours, and lifetime  number of charging times , and a reduction of size and price in order to improve their por- tability and ease of use [5].  6.3.2 Software Technology Roadmap and Issues  Complementing the hardware roadmap shown in Figure 6.5, Figure 6.6 shows the software technology roadmap for future terminals. The need for a high-speed and broadband network is already recognized, and 3G evolution, wireless broadband  e.g., WiBro , and 4G communication consider such requirements in their initial assumptions.

Besides, various services exploiting broadcast and user location will converge into mobile terminals, together with easy-to-use and comfortable user interfaces.  Communication Technology The 4G mobile systems are expected to offer higher transmission capabilities in different phases building upon the evolution from the 2G and 3G systems and providing users with an optimal access depending on their locations through linkage of multiple systems. Transmission speed of several megabytes per second per user will be also required in cellular environments due to the projected pro- liferation of wired Internet and multimedia services among the public. In addi- tion, in hotspots a speed of about several tens of megabytes per second-about 10 times faster than the speed available today-is expected to be required. These requirements can be seen as the driving force for 3G evolution like HSDPA and EV-DV and wireless broadband services like WiBro and WiMAX. Besides, short-range networking technologies like Bluetooth, WLAN, and optical wire- less communication systems  e.g., IrDA  will play a significant role in commu- nicating among various devices  including mobile terminals  and will accelerate the building of the ubiquitous world. In this respect, seamless networking, which is a technique to connect packet-based backbone networks with other radio access systems or networks, is essential for users to use multimedia services through various networking environment simultaneously.  Operating Systems An embedded real-time OS is generally used in a mobile terminal. However, the advance of multimedia content and multipurpose terminals has stimulated the development of open OS and mobile platforms. The OS and platforms with a user-centric interface and PC compatibility will take competitive advantages in a hot rivalry. Figure 6.7 shows the development trends of terminal platforms and operating systems.  User Interface  UI  Technologies The emergence of high-speed and broadband networks  such as 3G, WLAN, and WiBro  makes possible the transfer of rich content to the terminals. More- over, the rapid development of computing technology, such as CPU and DSP, and memory enable mobile terminals to function like personal computers. These changes in the mobile environment will create some pressure to develop technologies that allow a friendly use of complex terminals, including the access of mobile services and applications. UI technologies like signal processing, which enables the use of virtual keyboards and voice and gesture recognition,   226  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  Other VMs  Brew  GVM  2008  Proprietary OS  Java  Symbian  Microsoft  Other open OS  Linux  Palm  Proprietary OS  2003  Other VMs  GVM Brew Java  Symbian  Other open OS  Microsoft  Palm  Linux  Traditional low-end handsets  VAS  Multimedia phones  Smart phones  Connected-handheld PDA-phones  Figure 6.7 Mobile terminal platforms and OSs.  From: [6].   will be indispensable in eliminating the limitations of mobile terminals like small-size screens and keypads.  Multimedia In the area of multimedia, the following are some of the most important requirements for reproducing content in superior quality: high-resolution dis- play, high-quality video distribution, high-quality video play, a virtual reality capable of providing a sense of presence, and support of high-fidelity audio. Also required will be functions to change the audio video  A V  quality, network conditions, or terminal capabilities  voice video quality selection . Multimedia has already become a commonplace service in PC environments, but to enable equivalent processing in future mobile platforms, a tremendous leap must be achieved in lowering power consumption and enhancing video processing tech- niques. To provide QoS, techniques that guarantee users’ quality in real time must be developed [5]. Currently, H.264 and MPEG4 are the main multimedia codecs that are optimized for mobile terminals, and highly efficient and high-performance A V codecs will be developed as the processing power of CPUs and OSs is increased.   4G Terminals  227  Applications As the digital convergence is accelerated, new services are expected to emerge in several fields, such as location, telemetric, broadcasting, and high-quality multi- media services. Wireless communication will be the most effective method for distributing information and multimedia content to numerous users when broadband access and high speed are available. Broadcast and multicast services enable multiple users to share common information. In addition, they can be used to support new applications that could further stimulate the spread of mobile communications services, including the delivery of electronic papers or news at stations, airports, and hotels, the efficient provision of character infor- mation or still moving images to a number of users  e.g., at business shows , and the delivery of on-demand video music distribution [5].  6.4 Key Applications for Future Mobile Terminals  Mobile users have always had a positive attitude towards novel and useful appli- cations and services. There is no doubt of the importance of wireless applica- tions and services in the future. Applications and services will shape the development of future terminals as terminal capabilities determine the type and performance of applications and services that the terminal can support. As men- tioned, a distinctive characteristic of 4G is the fact that a whole range of differ- ent terminals will be used, ranging from simple voice and messaging only, to very advanced and powerful computer-like terminals relying on advanced input output technology. Thus, applications and services are factors as critical to the success of the future mobile terminal business as the different discussed tech- nologies. Convergence between broadcast and telecommunication is already in progress, and in the future this convergence will be accelerated rapidly to include several different fields, such as broadcast, telecommunication, and computer. Broadcast, Digital Rights Management, Multimedia Messaging Service, over the air provisioning, presence, PoC, and user plane location are important appli- cations to discuss. This section examines future applications and services from the terminal development point of view.  6.4.1 Broadcast  Mobile broadcast services refer to a broad range of services that make use of the one-to-many communication paradigm. Current developments in terminal technologies and digital broadcast systems have made broadcast services possible to use in the mobile environment. This, in turn, will enable low-cost mobile dis- tribution of multimedia content to users in the service area. Consequently, sub- stantial new business opportunities will open up for content and service providers as well as terminal and system vendors.   228  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  Digital broadcast  technologies such as DVB-T H [7], ISDB-T [8], 3GPP MBMS [9], and DAB [10] will make possible the distribution of any digi- tal content through the broadcast channel, such as audio and video streams, mov- ies, application software, or Web pages, with dramatically lower costs. Indeed, the delivery costs of broadcasting are insensitive to the number of receivers  within the coverage area of a transmitter . Consequently, media content can be delivered to large audiences at a fractional unit cost when compared to conven- tional mobile delivery over two-way, point-to-point wireless networks [11].  Broadcast and telecom network cooperation refers to the joint usage of these two complementary technologies in order to provide new features that each technology individually cannot provide in a satisfactory manner. Such a joint use of both networks  see Figure 6.8  can improve the capabilities and vari- eties of services and can make services more affordable.  6.4.2 Digital Rights Management  Digital Rights Management  DRM  defines a set of technologies that provides the means to control the distribution and consumption of the digital media objects, as shown in Figure 6.9. Since 4G is expected to rely heavily on multime- dia communications, DRM is an issue that needs be taken into account at the early stages of development. The DRM system is independent of media object formats, operating systems, and runtime environments. Content protected by the DRM can be of a wide variety: games, ring tones, photos, music clips, video clips, streaming media, and so forth.  Before content is delivered, it is packaged to protect it from unauthorized access. A content issuer delivers DRM content, and a rights issuer generates a rights object. A rights object governs how DRM content may be used.

From: [20].   content and rights objects may be requested separately or together, and they may be delivered separately or at the same time.  DRM content can only be accessed with a valid rights object, and so it can be freely distributed. This enables, for example, super distribution, as users can freely pass DRM content between them. To access the DRM content on a new device, a new rights object has to be requested and delivered to a DRM agent on that device.  Open Mobile Alliance  OMA  DRM [19] is one of the most well-known standards for mobile devices. OMA DRM v1 is for low value content such as ring tones. OMA DRM v2 is aiming for high value content by providing sophis- ticated security features for secure delivery of a rights object from a rights issuer to a mobile device. Some features of OMA DRM v2 include the following:    Enhanced security for the acquisition of rights objects;   Support for unconnected devices  a device without network capability ;   Content sharing by multiple devices;   Exporting OMA DRM content and rights objects to other DRM  systems.  OMA DRM v2 mainly supports the protection of mobile download ser-  vices, but it will be applied to mobile broadcast services as well.   230  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  6.4.3 Multimedia Messaging Service  Multimedia Messaging Service  MMS , as its name implies, provides a commu- nication technology to exchange multimedia messages between users. In con- trast to the well-known SMS, which can only contain limited text, MMS capable handsets can send and receive much larger messages combining, in addi- tion to text, various types of content such as still images, audio, or video. An example is shown in Figure 6.10.  Like many existing messaging systems  e.g., e-mail, SMS , MMS is nonreal-time and therefore relies on a store-and-forward paradigm. Interfaces between MMS and other messaging systems have been defined in various stan- dardization bodies  e.g., 3GPP, OMA  with the expectation of seeing these dif- ferent services interoperate. Another important aspect of MMS is to establish a service capable of interoperating across different networks, while remaining backward compatible with older version MMS terminals as the service evolves.  The following describes some recent MMS features  standardized in OMA  [14] :    Support for high-quality images: To support the introduction of hand- sets with high-resolution cameras, MMS is able to support resolutions beyond VGA.    MMS with service providers: In contrast with traditional person-to-per- son multimedia messaging, much effort has been put into enhancing interactions between subscribers and service providers. A typical exam- ple is the MMS postcard service, where it is possible to send a multime- dia message to a service that prints and mails it as a normal postcard to the appropriate recipients. Enhanced media types and presentation methods have been standardized to support multimedia communica- tion exchanges with service providers.  "SeewhatIsawinParis whenIwentonholiday."

From: [13].    4G Terminals  231    Extension of MMS to external applications: The potential of MMS can be extended to easily support new external applications and third-party services. For example, two MMS subscribers may be able to play chess via a third party service provider. Although the chess game by itself is not an application related to MMS, it can use MMS as a bearer to pro- vide, say, the chess board between the players.    Templates: Template can be defined as a model or pattern that allows the MMS subscriber to easily create multimedia messages  MMs , as illustrated in Figure 6.11. For example, an MMS postcard service could provide such a template to subscribers so that they can more easily create postcards.  6.4.4 Over-the-Air  OTA  Provisioning  Recent technological advances in the mobile communication industry have led to the introduction of large-scale Internet style, media-type independent, down- load of media objects. Examples include screen savers, ring tones, and Java MIDlets. Technology for confirmed download is used to deliver digital content such as entertainment and business applications as well as media objects to be rendered to mobile devices. Another important application area for download is to personalize terminals according to a user’s preferences and tastes. Some of the specific goals include the following:    Enable both automated and manual  client driven capability    Allow the initial download solution to be extended with new attributes    Create a solution that is quick and easy to deploy in order to shorten the  negotiation.  and functionality.  time to market.

Avoid fragmentation of content space. Content for mobile devices with  different capabilities can be published using a consistent concept.    Create commonality among the download process for all types of media   e.g., games, audio, and pictures .  For the content provider and operator, the main benefits of OTA  provisioning are as follows:    A description of the downloadable media objects can be published on the presentation server in a format independent of the presentation lan- guage  e.g., XHTML, WML, HTML  supported by the devices down- loading the media objects. The content provider creating the media objects needs only to publish the download descriptors on its Web site; the front-end of the download service can be provided by someone else, such as a special download Web site with media objects from many dif- ferent content providers.    The download is confirmed, with the status report posted to the net- work after the download. It can be used for monitoring the quality of the service and as the basis for billing.    The user can be directed to a Web location provided in the download  descriptor.  For the end user, the main benefits of OTA provisioning are as follows:    The end user is given a chance to confirm the download based on infor- mation in the download descriptor and the device’s capabilities; “How much room do I have left for other objects after having downloaded this one?”    The media object metadata in the download descriptor can be stored in the device and made available in the user interface as “properties”  name, vendor, type, info-URL  of the media object.    The download descriptor is the basis for a familiar “download user interface” in the device, a sequence of user interactions that are inde- pendent of Web sites and networks.    The probability of downloading a media object that the device cannot support is reduced as capability checks are made in the device just before the download starts. The user is prevented from downloading contents that do not work well on his device.   4G Terminals  233  Last but not least, the concept of a descriptor containing metadata about media objects and Web resources is extensible to use cases other than download.  6.4.5 Presence  The presence information describes the characteristics and the current status of the target user and the user’s service s  and device s . The presence service col- lects such information from various sources and then disseminates it to the entity s  that has requested the information.  As shown in Figure 6.12, the presence service is composed of the  following:    Presentity, a logical entity referring to the subject of the presence infor- mation. It includes a person, a group of people, a nonhuman entity, or even an abstract entity such as service itself.    Presence source, which contains the information on the presentity and  publishes the presence information on behalf of the presentity.    Presence server, which collects the presence information from the pres- ence sources, processes the collected presence information to resolve a consistent view on the presentity, and notifies the watcher s  such pres- ence information.

From: [16].    234  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  The presence service enables an entity to recognize its surrounding service environments, allowing the adaptive service behavior. For example, a user wants to reach his friend and has both telephone call and instant messaging service available. By virtue of the presence information on his friend, he finds out that his friend is reachable with the instant messaging and uses it to communicate with him.  Such a service environment-cognizant system is envisaged not only for enhancing existing services but also for expediting the provisioning of richer information and the advent of new value-added services.  6.4.6 PTT over Cellular  PoC, a newly defined terminology in OMA, is a mobile application service that adopts unidirectional communications. It allows mobile users to be engaged in an immediate communication with other users in a one-to-one call or a one-to-many call. As known by its name, one of the characteristic features of PoC service is its half-duplex transmission, and thus it requires floor control mechanism. On this point, it is similar to a walkie-talkie application where a user presses a button to talk with an individual user or broadcast to a group of users. After a speaker sends his voice, the receiving participants either hear the sender’s voice without any action on their part  without having to answer the call , or are notified and have to accept the call before hearing the sender’s voice. This depends on the answer settings of the receiving users. Other participants can just respond once this initial speech is complete and are allowed to talk to target participants. This feature of half-duplex communication contrasts with a general voice call, which is full duplex, where more than one person can talk simultaneously.  OMA is currently developing many service enablers to bring on various mobile application services. The PoC service is one of the significant and popu- lar application services. Market demands are requiring its urgent development in the near future. This is related to the peculiar features of PoC technology. As a representative application of IP multimedia CN domain  IMS , PoC utilizes many functionalities and infrastructures of that domain. For example, the PoC service enabler takes advantage of the functionality of the presence server to pro- vide ready-to-link service. Also, many types of group calls or conference calls are supported by the provisioning of the group management server in IMS domain. Though the first version of PoC does not include media other than voice stream, its inherent capabilities do not restrict a specific media type as transmission for- mat. This also makes it possible for the PoC service enabler to have a data orien- tation beyond simple voice service. With its strong coupling to data capabilities, other key features that are also needed for other data messaging services are also supported, like PoC interworking with instant messaging service and conversion   4G Terminals  235  of group call type from voice to text conferencing. The first version of PoC in OMA is treating only voice as its communicating media.  From a business point of view, a number of push-to-talk services and their supporting equipment have already emerged in the market. However, to date, these services and the products are all proprietary in nature. This can bring on a market fragmentation and too much diversity in the relevant industry. For global interoperability, a standardized specification is required that defines ser- vice in detail. As a final certification process, OMA mandates interoperability tests among different vendors’ equipment.  As the first stage of a two-phases approach, the first release of the PoC ser- vice enabler is in its completion period. The currently developed PoC service enabler, PoC Rel-1, supports the following capabilities.  1  There are three types of group call including ad hoc group, prearranged group, and chat group, each of which has typical feature of dialing procedure.  2  There is support for incoming session barring and instant personal alert barring. Those barring capa- bilities would enable the PoC users to prevent unwanted PoC invitation and from receiving unwilling invitation messages.  3  PoC Rel-1 also supports prees- tablished sessions and simultaneous sessions. Preestablished session is newly introduced to allow early session setup by exchanging media parameters such as codec, IP address, UDP port number, and talk burst control protocol. This pre- liminary session can provide fast call setup using specific SIP method and RTCP APP message for both originating side and terminating side. Simultaneous ses- sion allows participating multiple sessions at the same time, but allows only one media transmitted to the PoC user. This feature will be useful when a partici- pant is joining multiple sessions and wants to move continuously to get infor- mation.  4  As procedural features, automatic answer, manual answer, and manual answer override are also provided. Figure 6.13 shows the perspective view of the PoC service for one-to-one call and group call.  Many service aspects are required to implement full functionality of PoC.  Figure 6.14 illustrates the architectural block diagram of PoC Rel-1.  6.4.7 User Plane Location  Mobile location services based on the location of mobile devices are becoming increasingly widespread. User plane location employs user plane data bearers  e.g., IP  for transferring location assistance information such as GPS assistance and for carrying positioning technology related protocols between a mobile ter- minal and the network. User plane location is considered a cost-effective way of transferring location information required for computing the target mobile’s location. To offer a location service to a client, considerable signaling and posi- tion information is transferred between actors. Currently, assisted-GPS  A-GPS  provides more accurate positioning of a targeted mobile than other available   236  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  Member A  Member E  Wireless network  Member B  Figure 6.13 Example of a PoC one-to-many group session  voice transmission .

However, A-GPS over control plane of Radio Resource Control  RRC  or Radio Resource LCS Protocol  RRLP  requires modifications to existing network elements and interfaces  for signaling procedures between the terminal and the network . Location over user plane   4G Terminals  237  needs only an IP capable network and requires minimum modification to the network, and therefore user plane location is an efficient solution that can be deployed rapidly.  6.5 Challenges  Future 4G terminals could become extremely complex, particularly if the trend of developing multipurpose terminals capable of providing various types of con- nectivity  e.g., multistandard  and supporting diverse services persists. A num- ber of challenges for the design of such terminals have been identified. Among these challenges, RF integration and the evident mismatch between increased power consumption and the lagging development of battery technologies are considered as crucial. In this section we will discuss these issues and see how they could impact the development of 4G terminals.  RF Integration One can get a sense of the challenges that designers of future terminals will face by assuming a hypothetical feature-rich terminal boasting typical present-day connectivity and having some receiving functions. In order to provide wide cov- erage, mobility, and roaming, the terminal would include cellular 2G  e.g., GSM  and 3G  e.g., UMTS  transceivers working in the 900- to 1,800-MHz bands. High-speed local access could be provided by an 802.11  Wi-Fi  trans- ceiver in the 2.4 5-GHz bands. Basic short-range communication capabilities could be additionally carried out with a Bluetooth transceiver operating at 2.4 GHz. RFID is already being integrated in some handsets and allows very short-range instant connections for several purposes  e.g., payments, identifica- tion, information retrieval . RFID operates typically in the 13-MHz band, though low and high-frequency versions are available  100 KHz, 1 GHz, 2 GHz, 5 GHz . In addition, and following the trend of designing terminals with as many features as possible, one can also see the integration of a conventional FM radio receiver  100-MHz band , a terrestrial or satellite broadcast TV receiver  100-MHz to 1-GHz band , and a GPS Galileo  1.1- to 1.6-GHz band . Though all these services will not be used simultaneously, a few could be switched on in certain applications. Terminal design could become the bottle- neck for the development of multistandard multifeatured terminals, as radio fre- quency interference between different transceivers could have detrimental effects on the performance, in particular taking into account the physical limitations of having receivers and transmitters enclosed in a very small space. Methods for interference management and control should be carefully applied at the design stage. The situation becomes critical if one considers the fact that the transceiv- ers  e.g., for communications  and or receivers  e.g., radio, TV, GPS  may need   238  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  for  impossible  could even be  to use different antennas. Moreover, in order to attain the expected level of per- formance, particularly high data throughputs, cellular and local area systems have to resort to the use of multiple antennas. At high frequency bands  e.g., 5 GHz or higher  it is feasible to place several antennas on a small  handheld  ter- minal-for instance, an antenna array of four or even eight elements. Typically, these antennas have to be distributed to cover virtually all the available main plane  largest surface  of the terminal, in order to maximize antenna element separation. Obviously, future designers will face a very hard task trying to inte- grate efficiently multiple receiving and transmitting elements into small form factors. This certain combinations of multistandard and desired form factors. There is another important factor against having implemented several transceivers on one terminal: cost. Even in the case where multiple integration is technologically feasible, the relative high cost associated with having several standards implemented remains one of the central issues to be solved. However, there exists a different approach that has been extensively studied in recent years, and in the view of their proponents it could be, cost- and technology-wise, the most efficient way to go towards mak- ing complex terminals a reality. This solution is known as Software Defined Radio. Ideally, and in its broadest sense, SDR allows on-the-fly modifications of the RF front ends, baseband processing, and even the MAC layer of the termi- nal, aiming to realize a given air interface by reconfiguring the system. The degree of flexibility brought by real-time reconfigurability opens up a new world of possibilities for users, operators, services providers, and terminal manufactur- ers. Users can establish a connection in any network, allowing simple local and global roaming. Users could also benefit from the low-cost terminals that this technology would eventually bring. As new advanced services are introduced, software modifications can catch up with the new requirements. Hardware and software updates could be easily and wirelessly carried out by the user or by operators. Manufacturers can also take advantage of SDR since large volumes of terminals with identical hardware  and fewer number of components  would have to be produced. Even upgrades or changes in the terminals could be carried out simply. Also operators and service providers could exploit this flexibility to better match their operation and services to user demands.  Mismatch Between Increased Power Consumption and Development of Battery Technology In addition to the RF challenges described above, there are several fundamental issues that need to be solved to allow the full development and further success of 4G terminals. One of the most critical challenges comes from battery issues, and more precisely, from the slower development of battery technology in compari- son to developments in communications technologies. The obvious wireless or mobile condition of a terminal is ultimately dictated by the battery simply   4G Terminals  239  because the terminal operates wirelessly as long as its battery will allow it. Several of the most important features of 4G pose fundamental questions to the design- ers of future terminals, as one could expect that the power consumption of such terminals will dramatically rise. One can already notice this tendency in current 3G terminals and advanced PDAs as multimedia functions and high-speed com- munications are draining power to such levels that battery life is seriously com- promised. Thus, one can easily foresee that 4G terminals will have a much higher consumption. First, the support of broadband high-data rates means that more energy is needed to convey the information bearing bits reliably over the radio channel. High-speed processors are also needed for fast wideband data processing, which has a direct impact on power consumption. In addition, it is generally agreed that multiple antennas will play a fundamental role at the ter- minal side in order to achieve high data rates and guarantee an acceptable qual- ity of service. This means that the terminals will integrate a number of transceivers, typically two, three, four, or even more. Certainly, more transceiv- ers mean increased power consumption. Multimedia services and any type of transfer of rich content, including broadcast services, inherently consume a lot of power in their use of displays. High-definition video services imply more pix- els, improved contrast, and more computational power to process more frames per second, all of which will exhibit increased power consumption. One could then add the previously discussed fact that future terminals are likely to incorpo- rate various functions, with many of them being used simultaneously by the user or application. To this end one should remember that 4G advocates the concept of always being connected, meaning that the battery is constantly being drained. From the standpoint of 4G terminals, the key desirable characteristic of a battery would be its very high energy density  i.e., measured typically in Watt-hour per kilogram . Other desirable characteristics are long life-cycles, fast charge capabilities, safety, and environmental friendliness  low environmental load or low toxicity . The energy density of typical batteries is as follows: Nickel-Cadmium  Ni-Cd  50 to 80 Wh kg, Nickel-Metal Hybrid  Ni-MH  60 to 120 Wh kg, Lithium-Ion  Li-Ion  120 to 180 Wh kg, Lithium-Ion-Polymer  Li-Polymer  120 to 250 Wh kg, and future fuel cells from 500 Wh kg to more than 1,000 Wh kg. Present-day terminals mostly use rather high energy density batteries, usually Li-Ion and Li-Polymer based cells. In term of capacity, fuel cells have in theory the potential to fulfill the higher power consumption demand of future 4G terminals. However, and despite huge research efforts, the development of the fuel cell is still far from being mature. Miniaturization and weight and cost reduction are perhaps the most challenging issues that need to be solved before the fuel cell finds its way into future 4G terminals. The devel- opment of 4G as a whole will not be slowed down by the battery problem, but conceivably the development of 4G terminals could be slower than expected. advanced models with This  could be particularly true  for portable   240  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  very-high-speed capabilities, as they would need to incorporate several technolo- gies prone to increased power consumption. On the other hand, as we have already discussed, 4G terminals will be represented by a heterogeneous array of devices. In some cases like laptops with communication capabilities  another type of 4G terminal , the power drain will not be so critical since battery capac- ity is significantly higher than in small terminals. It is likely that upon introduc- tion of 4G, small terminals will exhibit moderate capabilities, nevertheless outperforming 3G terminals. As battery efficiency is enhanced-hopefully within a few years from the launch of 4G-manufactures will be able to offer better capabilities. We expect that two-antenna terminals will be typical for the early years of 4G.  6.6 Conclusions  In this chapter we discussed 4G terminals from different perspectives. The actual trend of having multifunction terminals is likely to continue. Even today, voice-only terminals are rapidly being displaced by devices with imaging and high-quality audio reproduction capabilities. 4G supports broadband commu- nications, the main driving force behind multimedia services. Certainly, 4G ser- vices can be better exploited in multifunction terminals. However, there is also a place for simple and basic terminals within 4G. In general we can say that a rich and diverse array of terminals will operate in 4G networks. Heterogeneity in ter- minals means not only a wide range in capabilities and performance, but also in size and shapes. Advanced multifunction terminals represent a challenge for the designers since portability and high performance  e.g., high-speed communica- tions, high computational power  have to be provided. Advances in display tech- nology, availability of larger and cheaper memory devices, miniaturization of components, antenna technologies, and new user friendly man-machine inter- faces together have the potential to conjure up in a class of terminals that would allure the user. Hardware and software technology that will find its way in 4G terminals was presented and discussed in this chapter. Several challenges that could slow down the development of advanced 4G terminals were identified, among them the problems of RF integration and low battery efficiency. In addi- tion, another challenge related to terminals is how to adapt and scale services according to the type and capabilities of the terminal requesting a particular ser- vice. This is a difficult integration question, in particular taking into account heterogeneous terminals and services from different manufacturers and provid- ers. It is probable that early 4G terminals will not fully exploit the capabilities of the new system, although they should initially outperform 3G terminals in order to create an attractive market. After launching 4G, it may take several years before we witness advanced terminals taking complete advantage of what broad- band communications offer.   4G Terminals  References  241  [1] Alahuhta, P., M.

In this concluding chapter we briefly highlight the most important issues of 4G, summarizing what has been presented in previous chapters and drawing our attention to the prospects for the future, the challenges ahead, and finally some concluding remarks. This chapter will wrap up the journey started in Chapter 1 by presenting a fascinating and universal vision of 4G. We believe that such a vision can lead us towards a viable solution for achieving a true knowledge society as well as to serve individual users while simultaneously being attractive to industry, operators, and service providers.  Chapter 1 gradually introduced 4G by discussing several visions and possi- ble definitions from several sources. In this introductory chapter we could see that there exists several somewhat different conceptions of 4G, though in most cases the visions share some commonalities. Coordinated efforts are needed not only to achieve a worldwide common understanding on what 4G will be, but also to identify and further develop the adequate technical solutions for its real- ization. In an attempt to provide a sound, rational, and flexible definition, Chap- ter 2 approached 4G from a user-centric perspective. The only way to guarantee the commercial success of 4G is by first understanding and fulfilling the users’ needs and expectations. Chapter 2 discussed user needs and trends in order to identify the user expectations in 4G. Specific and detailed discussions on 4G sce- narios and services were discussed. In our vision, 4G can be interpreted as a con- vergence platform where an eclectic array of networks is supported. The ITU visions and 4G spectrum issues were also presented and discussed in detail. 4G means the convergence of heterogeneous networks, terminals, and services into an everywhere reaching wireless communications system that appears to the user as monolithic and simple. The most promising access techniques for 4G were  243   244  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  presented and discussed in detail in Chapter 3. Given the heterogeneity of 4G component networks, it is likely that several access techniques will be used. It is widely agreed that multicarrier modulation and access techniques will play a fun- damental role in 4G. The main building block or key enabling technologies of 4G were presented in Chapter 4. These included MIMO technology, radio resource management, software radio communication systems, Mobile IP, and multihop techniques. In order to get better insight on the worldwide research and development towards 4G, Chapter 5 introduced and discussed major initia- tives, including the Wireless World Research Forum, the Mobile IT Forum, the Future Technology Universal Radio Environment project, the Next Generation Mobile Communication Forum, the 4G Research Cooperation Projects in the European Sixth Framework Programme, the Worldwide Wireless Initiative, the Samsung 4G Forum, and the eMobility Technology Platform. 4G terminals were considered in Chapter 6 from the technology and application point of view. We identified some trends, potentially good technical solutions as well as chal- lengers for the designers. We believe that, although 4G terminals will come in a large variety of form factors, sizes, and capabilities, a substantial part of these will be multifunctional, multistandard advanced devices. The critical success factors for 4G terminals are service convergence, a user-centric interface, and portable intelligence.  7.1 Short and Long-Term Visions of 4G  In Chapter 2 we described future 4G as a convergence platform encompassing and supporting different types of wireless communication networks  see also [1, 2] . We are already living in a period of convergence where mobile communica- tions, the Internet, computing, and broadcasting are becoming ubiquitous, but also, and equally important, these capabilities are supported by small, portable terminals. Internet and computing, once exclusively linked to large and fixed terminals  e.g., desktop computers , were gradually delivered to smaller devices like laptop and notebook computers. 4G will go one important step further: not only bringing these capabilities to smaller handheld terminals, but also making the connecting wires redundant everywhere, regardless of the terminal type. Also, from a broader perspective, we are witnessing convergence in different areas, as exemplified in Figure 7.1. In fact, information convergence has a pro- found impact on network, device  terminal , and service convergence, and vice versa. Information convergence refers to the fact that different types of informa- tion, in different formats, can be supported by the same system  e.g., transport and access network and terminals . It also refers to the fusing of telecommunica- tions and broadcasting. Service convergence indicates a temporal and spatial continuity in the provision of services, over networks, terminals, and operators.

We see that in the short term the path towards 4G will go through 3G evolution, corresponding to the B3G period, as shown on the roadmap in Figure 7.2  see also Figure 2.13 in Chapter 2 . The B3G technology roadmap can be envisioned either by cellular-based, 2G, 3G, and B3G or nomadic-based, IEEE 802.11  WLAN , 802.16  WiMAX and WiBro . 3GPP and 3GPP2 have been active recently in the 3G evolution standards work, and both target the third quarter of 2007 for completion of 3GPP 2 evolution standards.

ITU is actively studying global spectrum allocation for 4G in WRC-07, and with WRC-07 global spectrum results, a long-term 4G standard may start with both evolutionary and revolutionary approaches. Research and business interest in future 4G systems is globally increasing and extensive research in various fields of 4G is progressing through WWRF and regional national 4G research fora.  New services and killer applications are crucial for differentiating 4G from 3G. For advanced high-speed multimedia services and applications, an IP-centric simplified network architecture is essential to reduce the infrastruc- ture cost. IP networking is also fundamental to provide seamless connectivity in heterogeneous networks. In Korea, the IEEE-802.16e-based WiBro service will start commercially in 2006. We consider 3GPP and 3GPP2 evolution as well as IEEE 802.16e evolution paths towards 4G as a short-term development. In addition, already started parallel developments targeting very high data throughputs for nomadic and mobile environments  e.g., 100 Mbps and 1 Gbps, respectively  based on multicarrier modulation techniques  e.g., OFDM, MC-CDMA  and using a yet-to-be-defined frequency spectrum are seen as the long-term vision of 4G.

Towards a Unified Convergence on 4G  247  7.2  The Challenges Ahead  The idea of a highly interconnected wireless knowledge society is certainly appealing. Although the user is always considered the ultimate beneficiary, ter- minal and infrastructure manufacturers, operators, and service providers see in this paradigm an unmatched opportunity for their businesses. In its widest sense the 4G concept appears to be the most ambitious ever, and the very first attempt to realize a true knowledge society. The challenges that researchers and develop- ers of 4G will encounter are not few nor are the problems always easy to solve. On the other hand, in terms of social impact and technology development, the reward is well worth the necessary efforts. In what follows, and without trying to provide an exhaustive list, we briefly discuss the key challenges that researchers and developers of 4G systems are likely to face.    Multiple 4G definitions. There is a clear  lack of a universal, well-accepted, and unique definition of 4G. Regardless of huge efforts and several years of discussions, there is no worldwide consensus on the definition of 4G. Proposals and visions by ITU and WWRF should be respected and considered as authoritative suggestions for the benefit of all involved partners. Fortunately, developing parties are starting to identify some common characteristics and target capabilities required for 4G systems. Nevertheless, additional efforts should be made in order to ultimately converge towards a common understanding on what is 4G. This will be the first step to guarantee sound foundations and a global footprint for 4G. The importance of a global 4G standard is undeniable for the whole 4G value chain, from manufacturers, carri- ers, and service providers down to the users.    User-centric approach. Putting the user in the center of the scene appears to be the most logical approach to 4G development. In other words, technology is developed to fulfill users’ need and expectations. How- ever, 4G is not necessarily targeting an immediate future and thus, understanding and predicting user needs at a larger time scale is diffi- cult, if not impossible. Moreover, this is time consuming and requires considerable efforts, as there is not just one user profile. Failing to pre- dict the users’ needs may lead in the worst case to 4G technology unable to fulfill user expectations. An opposite approach, creating first a generic technology to then trying to match the user needs to that tech- nology is not a better option, in terms of risks. These are somewhat extreme cases, but 4G designers should understand the risk involved. One should not forget also the trendsetter role of industry. It is not only the user who dictates what industry does, industry also create trends   248  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  that user will follow. It well could be that 4G will emerge from a middle way approach.  it  is    Seamless interconnectivity. If 4G is a network of networks, then how do make an array of heterogeneous networks work and appear as a single network regardless of where accessed? Seamless vertical  internetwork  and horizontal  intranetwork  handovers are fundamen- tal for achieving ubiquitous connectivity without interruption in the wireless ecosystem. The convergence and integration of existing, evolv- ing, and newly developed technologies is critical to the success of 4G. Since the component parts of 4G  e.g., access schemes for different net- works  are being developed independently by different parties, develop- ment seamless communications should be started at an early stage.  interconnection  supporting  techniques  of    Latency. Several services and applications in 4G will be delay sensitive, particular those exploiting real-time multimedia-based communica- tions. Special care should be put in fulfilling requirements for transmis- sion delays particularly when the contents could be reached from an array of possible networks with possible different access architectures. Connection delays should also be short enough, regardless of the net- work type or access architecture. Typical maximum accepted values for connection and transmission delays in 4G networks are 500 ms and 50 ms, respectively.    Scalability of services in a world of heterogeneous terminals. 4G terminals will have different capabilities  supported data rate, resolution, process- ing power, size . How do you efficiently scale up and down services to terminals with different capabilities? This appears to be a difficult task as terminal range is broad and there will be numerous manufacturers and service providers.    Exchange of complexity for simplicity. 4G networks will be complex, but in order to penetrate into the market with success, the user should expe- rience 4G as a simple and intuitive system. Clearly the challenge is hid- ing networking complexity from users.    Technology fragmentation. By definition 4G encompasses several comple- mentary technologies. As these technologies are developed, they tend to overlap in capabilities, resulting in competition. A severely fragmented 4G will also fragment the market, with negative effects on manufactur- ers, operators, and users. Technology fragmentation is inherent to 4G, but should lead to complementary systems rather than competing ones.   Timetables for 4G. There is marked difference in the schedule for adopt- ing, deploying, and launching 4G in different regions of the world. Asia   Towards a Unified Convergence on 4G  249  has probably the tightest schedule, targeting 2010 as the introductory year. Europe has a less tight schedule, aiming for 2015 or beyond. Early adopters could accelerate the adoption of 4G in other regions, but this might also further fragment or disrupt the worldwide markets.    Spectrum. It is difficult to design a concrete wireless communications system without the knowledge of the frequency band allocated for oper- ation. Knowledge of channel behavior is essential for the system designer. The availability of paired unpaired bands also has a profound impact on the duplexing mode to be used. Moreover, since 4G assumes the use of MIMO systems, it is difficult if not impossible to design future multiantenna-based systems without knowing the spectrum in which the system will be operating  and hence channel behavior . Spectrum allocation for 4G will hopefully be decided in 2007 2008 by the World Radio Conference. Scarcity of spectrum is another challenge to be taken into account. In addition to the development of communi- cations techniques with higher spectral efficiency, new promising techniques like cognitive radio need to be studied and possibly applied in 4G.    Access architectures. The suitability and limitations of conventional and nonconventional access architectures in different 4G radio networks need to be better understood. Network access architectures include infrastructure  e.g., single and multihop cellular  and infrastructureless  e.g., ad hoc  based concepts. Cooperative techniques are emerging also as a very promising network access approach.    Efficient resource allocation. Management of available resources is crucial to guarantee a truly effective utilization of always-scarce time, fre- quency, and spatial resources. This is particularly true for 4G systems where multicarrier and multiantenna systems are likely to be used. Finding efficient, fair, and simple-to-implement strategies to allocate resources in multiuser environments is far from trivial.    Interference Management. Multiple access interference in heterogeneous networks with multiples operational air interfaces, heterogeneous ter- minals and heterogeneous services could be an issue. In addition to the interference issues at network level, also potential interference problems within the terminal should be considered. Indeed, multistandard and multiantenna terminals pose serious challenges for terminal designers, as it could be very difficult to manage and control RF interference within small form factor terminals.    Battery technology. The energy density of current batteries is rather low, and if such batteries were used in 4G terminals they will not provide enough operative time, particularly if rich-content multimedia and   250  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  high-speed communications are used. Fuel cells have one order of mag- nitude higher energy densities and so they have the potential to solve this problem. However, fuel cells are still in an immature state. It is expected that the development of fuel cells will reach maturity at around 2010, a timeframe that agrees approximately with the schedule for the launching of 4G in some parts of the world.    Power aware design and power management. Since radical improvements in battery technology are not likely to take place within the introductory period of 4G, power efficient methods and solutions concepts helping to reduce power consumption in terminals should be critically investi- gated. This applies basically to the whole design chain and it is related not only to hardware issues like developing low-power consumption components but also it calls for development of power-friendly software and applications. Moreover, techniques, algorithms and system design rules inherently minimizing the power drain will be essential in future 4G systems. Paradoxically, MIMO, identified as a key 4G enabling technology, does not necessarily help to reduce power consumption in terminals. Cooperative techniques, including multihop approaches, used independently or complimentarily with MIMO, are seen as promising to keep power consumption at lower levels.    Security issues. Multimedia-based rich-content communication poses significant security risks for the user, for the information being trans- ferred, and for the content rights. These are fundamental issues that need to be solved before associated services and applications are intro- duced. Also, since we are considering a highly heterogeneous network where information can be accessed from different places and through different air for management of user and information security should be considered.  interfaces,  strategies    Interlayer design. Work needs to be done at all OSI layers, separately and jointly. Unlike in previous generations, scarcity and a high demand for resources in 4G leads us to seek efficient solutions to better use the fre- quency, time, and spatial resources. Cross-layer design and optimiza- tion are unique and important techniques that the 4G research and development community is relying on.    Costs. It is expected that the cost of 4G infrastructure should be signifi- cantly lower than that corresponding to 3G networks. A target cost of one order of magnitude lower is often mentioned. However, as the pro- spective band to be allocated to 4G appears to be at higher frequencies than in current 2G and 3G systems, cell coverage is expected to be smaller, leading to the need of more base stations to cover the same area. Also, higher data throughputs shrinks cells significantly. New   Towards a Unified Convergence on 4G  251  access architectures, e.g., based on relaying stations, have the potential to solve theses problems. It is clear that lower infrastructure and termi- nal costs will help to increase 4G network penetration, but considerable research and development efforts need to be done to achieve these goals. Cost per  received  bit of information should also be much lower than in current systems  e.g., one hundred times or even cheaper than at present . Services and their use should be attractively priced. The nature of the information that 4G networks will transfer data requires new pricing strategies.    Synergetic efforts. In order to become a reality, technical challenges have to be solved by worldwide research and development forces. More than ever, concepts and technical solutions should be developed jointly by industry and academia.    Potential IPR battlefield. As 4G represents a mosaic of integrated tech- nologies, it has the potential to become a fertile ground for generating IPRs in various complementary areas. This would benefit the related industry, and also academia. However, as 4G involves some key tech- nologies likely to be present across the whole 4G network  e.g., multicarrier techniques, multiantenna techniques, etc. , some essential IPRs to 4G may have a dominant position, endangering the whole 4G development, deployment and marketing.    Open 4G Standards. In order to succeed 4G should be an open standard and thus, industry should strive to continue with the common practice of 2G, 3G and IEEE wireless standards, among others.  7.3 Conclusions  Convergence is the word that can be best associated with 4G. Convergence can be interpreted in several ways: convergence of wireless and wired networks; convergence of communications, consumer electronics, and computing; and convergence of services, as illustrated by Figure 7.4. From the 4G terminals per- spective, one can see a clear trend where several functions and capabilities con- verge into a single terminal, a multimode  multistandard , multifunction terminal. 4G will materialize the so-called three-screen convergence, bringing together TV, PC and mobile phone screens into a single portable device. These screens, perhaps the most notorious technology icons of our time, are watched and scrutinized day after day by billions of people worldwide, mostly at their home, working places and gradually on the move. 4G will not only fuse these separately developed technologies but also and more importantly, it will ulti- mately free them from any physical connection to the information sources. We   252  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  Wireless   wired networks  Convergence  Computer  communications  consumer electronics  Services: speech, data, graphics, video, multimedia  Figure 7.4 Multiple convergence concept in 4G.  call this the flying screen concept, as this screen is capable of displaying any con- tent, anywhere the user is, at anytime, and on the move. Figure 7.5 illustrates the three-screen convergence in 4G and the concept of flying screen. Conver- gence will also take place at the network level, where several heterogeneous net- works will appear as to be merged into a single network of networks, as shown in Figure 7.6. Indeed, a 4G network will encompass the entire network hierarchy, from a very wide coverage broadcasting network down to personal networks, and will consider wireless wide area networks, wireless metropolitan networks,  Three-screen convergence  TV  MS  4G  PC  flyingscreen  The concept brings together the familiar screens of  into a single wireless device   cid:127  TV  cid:127  PC  Internet   cid:127  Mobile Phone   cid:127  anywhere  cid:127  any time  cid:127  any content  Figure 7.5 “The” Flying screen concept represents the convergence of mobile phones, PC  and TV screen.

To the user this 4G network will appear as a single, simple, and all-reaching network.  As was discussed in Chapter 2, 4G should be approached from the user perspective. 4G cannot be justified just from a technology point of view. Tech- nology, although of fundamental importance, is just the means to satisfy user needs and expectations, and it should come after potentially good services and applications have been identified. Users are not attracted by figures like high data throughput, but they will greatly appreciate useful services exploiting those high data rates. This appears to be the only approach to guarantee an economi- cally successful 4G [2]. The concept of 4G should not only be seen as a technol- ogy to provide man-to-man communication but also it should also encompass man-to-machine and machine-to-machine communications.  When one contrasts past and present mobile communication systems with the concepts of 4G, one certainly notices that a paradigm shift is needed in order to better describe and understand future communication systems. Indeed, previ- ous and current systems are basically cellular systems operating in cells with moderate to large sizes. 3G also brought the concept of hotspots providing, for instance, high data rate services mostly in indoor scenarios, as well  vertical  handovers between wide area and local area systems. These ideas are still in 4G   254  4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies  systems, but only as component parts. 4G has a wide area mobile component including previous cellular  legacy  systems, their evolution, as well as newly developed very high data throughput systems. In particular, these new systems may not necessarily be based on conventional  single-hop  cellular architectures. Several promising options for access architectures for wide and metropolitan area networks are being taking into account currently, including the concepts of multihop, cooperative and distributed radio. 4G has a fixed or nomadic compo- nent for short-range  local area  communications using access architectures with infrastructure  e.g., cellular  or infrastructureless  e.g., ad hoc communications allowing direct or multihop peer-to-peer communications . In terms of cover- age, 4G includes everything from personal area networks to distribution  broad- cast  networks, and vertical and horizontal handovers work seamlessly, at any place and time. These networks are, in principle, complementary and hence they are designed specifically to coexist. However, at the current development phase, there are several proponent access concepts that clearly overlap in capabilities, and therefore they can be considered as competing. The 4G arena is, by defini- tion, fragmented, but it should not become too fragmented. It is desirable that before the standardization phase begins, a preselection process identifies a reasonable number of potentially good concepts and techniques. We see that WWRF is the most appropriate organization to carry out this job in a global basis.  In an attempt to ultimately define the future 4G network, while taking into account all the observations and existing common understanding, we can state the following:  4G is defined as an evolutionary and revolutionary fully IP-based integrated system of systems and network of networks achieved after convergence of wired and wireless networks as well as computers, consumer electronics, and communication technology, as well as several other convergences that will be capable of providing 100 Mbps and 1 Gbps, respectively, in outdoor and indoor environments, with end-to-end QoS and high security, offering any kind of services at any time as per user requirements, anywhere, with seamless interoperability, always on, at an affordable cost, with one billing, and fully personalized.  This is a fascinating vision of 4G. It appears to be the most viable solution for achieving a truly knowledge-based society. It will serve users and still remain attractive to industry, operators and, services providers.  Convergence is really what 4G is all about: convergence of fixed and mobile communications, as well as convergence of regional-area, wide-area, metropolitan-area, local-area, and personal-area networks. 4G is convergence of information, convergence of services, and convergence of terminals. The key is   Towards a Unified Convergence on 4G  255  the availability of new technologies. The speed with which telecom operators can roll out converged fixed and mobile services is heavily dependent on the technological revolution taking place at both the network and handset level. Convergence of networks, technologies, applications, and services will offer a personalized and pervasive network to user and will bring a myriad of unrivaled business opportunities to all related parties.  As we have discussed, the key prerequisite to accomplish such a conver- gence at a technical level is to first achieve a widespread convergence of visions on 4G. We acknowledge the role of WWRF as a key consensus making organi- zation spanning the globe. The sooner the involved parties achieve a common understanding of 4G, and the wider and deeper the consensus, the better the chances of realizing the above 4G definition with technically sound and eco- nomically attractive solutions. As the vision imagines, the opportunities that 4G could bring are countless. Opportunities are for the users, society itself, and eventually every single entity, for becoming an integral part of an all-reaching and omnipotent communication network. The opportunities are unmatched for industry and academia to develop and investigate technical solutions. Similarly, operators and service providers will find that 4G is a very fertile land to develop new businesses. Opportunities also mean challenges and risks and they should be identified at early stages.  Convergence is heading towards the advent of a really exciting and some- what disruptive concept of fourth generation mobile networks. Even though industry and the research community are highly committed to the development of 4G, additional efforts are needed to create a more solid and widely accepted blueprint of 4G. Then, the way towards a smoother and quicker standardization process will be paved.

4G is essentially a network of networks. It is still a somewhat hazy view of where to go, beyond the current 2G and 3G deployments. Seamless nomadic usage and ubiquitous access are key characteristics. Along with bandwidth of 50-100 Mbps. All by 2010, at least in Asia, by one schedule. While another schedule has this deployed in Europe by 2015. The reader will be struck by the US being at some later unspecified date. While you may be used to the US leading in other technological fields, in the wireless sphere, it is an also-ran by a wide margin. Mobile IP is suggested by the text as one of the needed technologies. The discussion reveals that it runs best using IPv6, not the current IPv4. Using it under IPv4 is very cumbersome. If you have been following IPv6, you might think its deployment has been slow. A large demand for Mobile IP could be one of the key drivers for an accelerated rollout
