universe is one god-awful big interacting wavefunction— but to the rest of us, it’s a world full of separate and distinguishable objects that hurt us when we kick them. At a few months of age, human children recognize objects, expect them to be permanent and move continuously, and display surprise when they aren’t or don’t. We associ- ate visual, tactile, and in some cases audible, and olfactory sensations with identiﬁable physi- cal things. We’re hardwired to understand our environment as being composed of separable things with speciﬁc properties and locations. We understand the world in terms of what was where and when. So, one can forgive us for being disappointed that the computers and networks that form so large a part of our lives and often seem so intelligent in other respects  at least on a good day  are clueless when it comes to perceiving and recognizing all these discrete physical objects that we so easily detect and categorize. Why do we have to labori- ously inform a computer database, by typing or mousing or tapping a screen, that a perfectly recognizable object has arrived at our doorstep? Why is so much human intervention needed for such a simple task?  It is to correct this deﬁciency of networked sensibilities that the ﬁeld of automated identiﬁca- tion  auto-ID  has arisen. Auto-ID includes any means of automating the task of identifying a physical object. To date, by far the most common means of doing so is to print a special machine-decipherable bar code on an object, and then image or scan the code using an optical transducer to extract an identifying number. One-dimensional bar codes  so named because information is obtained in traversing the pattern in a single direction, not because such patterns are in fact absent depth and height  are easily deciphered and, in the form of the universal product code  UPC  and its more modern descendents, nearly ubiquitous in the commercial world. Two-dimensional bar codes are also available and pack more information into the same space. Optical character recognition  OCR  can be used to acquire information from conventional human-readable text, at the cost of an increase in computing requirements and decreased reliability. However, all optical methods of identifying an object have some deﬁciencies. Most fundamentally, the sensing device must be able to see the identifying mark: optical techniques require a clear line of sight. Not only objects but dirt, paint, ink, and other  1   Chapter 1  objectionably opaque but relentlessly commonplace substances can distort or deface bar codes and other optical marks, obscuring the information that optical auto-ID techniques require. Mechanical damage to the marks or labels degrades their readability. To store more data requires more space, or the use of ﬁner markings visible from a shorter distance. Finally, data stored in printed marks on a surface is not readily modiﬁed or extended, save perhaps by wholesale replacement. While optical techniques for object identiﬁcation are versatile and inexpensive, it is clear that in many cases another approach may be helpful.  To remedy some of the deﬁciencies of optical ID, we can turn to an alternative technique, radio-frequency identiﬁcation  RFID . RFID is the use of radio communications to identify a physical object. RFID is really not one but a suite of identiﬁcation technologies because of the differing characteristics of the radio waves of varying frequency used, and because of the differing approaches to operating the sensors that serve to identify individual objects. RFID has existed for more than half a century, but its widespread application has had to wait for inexpensive integrated circuits to enable small, low-cost transponders  the parts of the system that get attached to an object to be identiﬁed, more commonly known as RFID tags  to be fabricated. Over the last three decades, as the capability of integrated circuits has dou- bled and the cost per function halved about every 2 years, religiously attending to Gordon Moore’s famous law, new RFID applications have become economically feasible. In parti- cular, since the mid-90s, a great deal of effort has been focused on the application of RFID in the manufacture and distribution of goods: supply chain management, where until recently the bar code reigned supreme. To serve the needs of manufacturing, distribution, and shipment functions, RFID tags must be very inexpensive, compact, mechanically robust, and readable from at least a meter or two away. As we will examine in more detail in Chapter 2, this combination of requirements has led to the choice of ultra-high-frequency  UHF  radio waves and passive RFID tags as the approach of choice for many supply chain applications, and it is UHF RFID technology that is the main topic of this book.  1.2 Why Would You Read This Book?  The purpose of The RF in RFID is to provide users of UHF RFID with an understanding of how identiﬁcation information gets from a tag to a reader and in some cases back to the tag. We will use that understanding to see how the system of tags, readers, and antennas goes together, and analyze the capabilities and limitations resulting from the choices of tag, reader, antenna, and protocol. This book is for people who want to know why things RFID are the way they are and what  if anything  can be done about it, and perhaps be entertained upon occasion along the way.  As we will see as we proceed, the replacement or supplement of bar codes with RFID tags may give rise to a substantial increase in the amount of information available about objects  2   Introduction  being made, shipped, or sold, and thus create a need for improved software solutions to enable useful integration of this new knowledge into the existing infrastructure for managing such transactions. The reader must, alas, turn elsewhere for advice and insight on software integra- tion issues: this book is focused on tags, readers, and their interactions. For folks familiar with the OSI reference model for communications systems, The RF in RFID is a book about the physical layer of a UHF RFID system, with some digressions into the data link layer, but no higher.  You don’t need a prior acquaintance with radio technology to read the book  although it doesn’t hurt , but familiarity with basic electrical engineering concepts of current, voltage, power, frequency, capacitance, and inductance is very helpful. A general familiarity with algebraic manipulation, and the concepts of an integral and derivative, will be needed to follow the derivations of key formulas; a brief review of a few more specialized mathe- matical tools that are widely used in electrical engineering is provided within the Appendices in the interests of completeness.  1.3 What Comes Next?  The structure of the remainder of this book is depicted in Figure 1.1.  Figure 1.1: Overview of this Book.  3   Chapter 1  Chapter 2 is a general introduction to RFID, including a bit of history, some terminologies, and an examination of the various ﬂavors of RFID and their characteristics and uses. Chapter 3 introduces the reader to the basics of radio technology: transmission, modulation, bandwidth, signal voltage, and power. Chapter 4 describes how the speciﬁc radios used in UHF RFID readers work. Chapter 5 delves into the operation of passive UHF RFID tags. Chapter 6 examines reader antennas: how they work and how they are characterized and described. Chapter 7 extends this discussion to the peculiar requirements of passive tag antennas. Chapter 8 reviews the tag-reader protocols used in UHF RFID. A brief Afterword rounds out the main text of the book. Appendices cover some supplemental information, including the radio regulatory world in which manufacturers and users of RFID systems must operate, and some electrical engineering background useful for those from other ﬁelds.  In the interests of clarity, detailed citations are not provided within the text. However, each chapter contains a Further Reading section directing the still-curious reader to additional materials related to the topics covered therein. Each chapter  except this one  also contains exercises to provide an opportunity to exercise concepts introduced in the text; answers may be found at the author’s web site, www.enigmatic-consulting.com. The book is accompanied by a CD containing hopefully useful and perhaps also entertaining supplementary materials; we shall occasionally draw the reader’s attention to those relevant to particular sections of the text.  1.4 Acknowledgments  A book is a collective endeavor even when only one author’s name appears on the front cover.

Detection of air- planes beyond visual range was the task of microwave radar, also under rapid development in the 30s, but mere detection of the presence of aircraft begged the key question: whose side were they on? It was exactly this inability to identify aircraft that enabled the mistaken assign- ment of incoming Japanese aircraft to an unrelated United States bomber ﬂight and so ensured surprise at Pearl Harbor in 1941. The problem of identifying as well as detecting potentially hostile aircraft challenged all combatants during World War II.  The Luftwaffe, the German air force, solved this problem initially using an ingeniously simple maneuver1. During engagements with German pilots at the beginning of the war, the British noted that squadrons of ﬁghters would suddenly and simultaneously execute a roll for no appa- rent reason. This curious behavior was eventually correlated with the interception of radio signals from the ground. It became apparent that the Luftwaffe pilots, when they received indication that they were being illuminated by their radar, would roll in order to change the backscattered signal reﬂected from their airplanes  Figure 2.1 . The consequent modulation of the blips on the radar screen allowed the German radar operators to identify these blips as friendly targets. This is the ﬁrst known example  at least to the author  of the use of a passive backscatter radio link for identiﬁcation, a major topic of the remainder of this book. Passive refers to the lack of a radio transmitter on the object being identiﬁed; the signal used to communicate is a radio signal transmitted by the radar station and scattered back to it by the object to be identiﬁed  in this case an airplane .  1 Unfortunately, at the moment this is an unveriﬁed Internet report, for which I have been unable to ﬁnd an archival  source—but it is such a fun story I had to include it anyway! An authoritative citation for  or debunking of  the story would be appreciated. –DMD  7   Chapter 2  Figure 2.1: The Use of Backscattered Radiation to Communicate With a Radar Operator  not to scale! .  As a means of separating friend from foe, rolling an airplane was of limited utility: any aircraft can be rolled and no speciﬁc identifying information is provided. That is, the system has problems with security and the size of the ID space  1 bit in this case . More capable means of establishing the identity of radar targets were the subject of active investigation during the 1930s. The United States and Britain tested simple IFF systems using an active beacon on the airplane  the XAE and Mark I, respectively  in 1937 1938. The Mark III system, widely used by the Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union during the war, used a mechanically tunable receiver and transmitter with six possible identifying codes  i.e., the ID space had grown to 2.5 bits . By the mid-1950s, the radar transponder still in general use in aviation today had arisen. Modern transponders are interrogated by a pair of pulses at 1030 MHz, in the ultra-high frequency  UHF  band about which we will have a lot more to say shortly. The transponder replies at 1090 MHz with 12 pulses each containing 1 bit of information, providing an ID space of 4096 possible codes. A mode C transponder is connected to the aircraft altimeter and also returns the current altitude of the aircraft. A mode-S transponder also allows messages to be sent to the transponder and displayed for the pilot. Finally, the typical distance between the aircraft and the radar is on the order of one to a few kilometers. Since it takes light about 3 μs to travel 1 km, the radar reﬂection from  8   History and Practice of RFID  a target is substantially delayed relative to the transmitted pulse, and that delay can be used to estimate the distance of the object.  An aircraft transponder thus provides a number of functions of considerable relevance to all our discussions in this book:          Identiﬁcation of an object using a radio signal without visual contact or clear line of sight: radio-frequency identiﬁcation    An ID space big enough to allow unique2 identiﬁcation of the object    Linkage to a sensor to provide information about the state of the object identiﬁed  in this case, the altitude above ground   Location of each object identiﬁed  angle and distance from the antenna   Transmission of relevant information from the interrogator to the transponder  These functions encompass the basic requirements of most RFID systems today: RFID has been around for a long time. However, for many years, wider application of these ideas beyond aircraft IFF was limited by the cost and size of the equipment required. The early military transponders barely ﬁt into the conﬁned cabins of ﬁghter airplanes, and even modern general aviation transponders cost US$1000–5000. In order to use radio signals to identify smaller, less-expensive objects than airplanes, it was necessary to reduce the size, complexity, and cost of the mechanism providing the identiﬁcation.  2.2 Making it Cheap  The most important underlying dynamic enabling the wide use of RFID has been the unpre- cedented increase in capability and decrease in cost of electronics ever since the invention of the transistor, most particularly the scaling of integrated logic circuitry according to Gordon Moore’s famous law ever since the 1960s. This trend has impacted every aspect of modern life, including the use of radios  and other technologies  for identiﬁcation.  However, RFID also has some speciﬁc requirements not normally encountered in other radio communications systems. These requirements are essentially economic in nature: any method of identifying an object must cost less than knowledge of the identity of that object is worth.  2 Unique in this context, anyway. Obviously there are more than 4096 aircraft in the world, but rarely 4096 aircraft within range of one radar. Note that aircraft ﬂying under visual ﬂight rules instead of positive air trafﬁc control all use the same code, 1200.  9   Chapter 2  Such constraints are of minimal consequence when identifying an airplane that costs anywhere from $100 000 to $100 000 000 and where an error in identiﬁcation or location could result in a midair collision costing billions of dollars. The same insensitivity to cost is less appropriate when the object to be identiﬁed is an automobile or rail car, and incon- ceivable when the object is a case of disposable diapers.  Thus, RFID applications often require radios that are extraordinarily cheap and simple. In addition to simply reducing the cost of the electronics, there are several special pieces of technology that enable very inexpensive identifying tags to be produced:    No transmitter: we’ve already examined above the idea of skipping the transmitter by varying some property of the signal reﬂected back from an object. Since trans- mitters are large, complex, and power-hungry, particularly at high frequencies, skipping a transmitter is very useful.    No battery: batteries, as any parent of small children can tell you, are expensive,  maintenance intensive, and easily tripped over. A tag that either doesn’t need power or can ﬁnd it somewhere else is a good thing.        Simple circuitry: the less the tag has to think about, the better. Reducing the intel- ligence in the tag usually involves a tradeoff with security and the size of the available ID space.  Standing out of the noise: a tag that uses the transmitted signal to communicate creates a problem for the reader, that of hearing the tiny tag signal in the big reader signal.  Let’s examine how the tricks that enable an RFID system to satisfy these requirements have come about. As we noted above, the use of backscattered radiation to send 1 bit to a radar operator was demonstrated in the late 30s, but a single bit is not a very ﬂexible payload. An early investigation of the use of backscattered radiation to communicate more substantial information was reported by Harry Stockman in 1948; one of the conﬁgurations he explored is shown schematically in Figure 2.2. A conventional microphone and speaker coil were used to modulate the position of a receiving antenna according to the sound received by the micro- phone. This positional modulation in turn affected the signal reﬂected back to the transmitter, where the sound could be demodulated and reproduced despite the fact that there is no radio transmitter associated with the microphone. This is the ﬁrst example of a backscatter radio link conveying substantial amounts of information back to the transmitter.  In the early 1950s, passive backscatter links of this type were investigated with, among others, the object of creating an inexpensive wireless telephone system  the cellular phone being at  10   History and Practice of RFID  Figure 2.2: Use of Backscattered Radiation to Communicate; After Stockman, Proc. I.R.E., October 1948.

Another patent of the same era  Figure 2.3  shows the use of a signal received on an antenna and rectiﬁed by a diode, with the DC used to power a transistor oscillator to produce an identi- fying signal at a second, unrelated frequency: an early RFID application, although in this case the frequencies envisioned are rather low and the “tag” antennas would be quite ungainly by modern standards!  In many applications of this type, unlike Mr. Stockman’s 10-km link, ranges of less than a meter are quite sufﬁcient. When the distance is a few tens of centimeters, it may no longer be necessary to launch a wave and reﬂect it: the transmitter and receiver can be inductively coupled, so that the load presented to the transmitter by the receiver can be intentionally  11   Chapter 2  varied to produce a signal at the transmitter, again without the need for active signal generation by the receiver. Inductively coupled systems can operate at much lower fre- quencies than those used in radar, typically tens of kilohertz to around 10 MHz. This combination of simplicity, low frequency, and short range enables one to produce compact, low-cost transponders, and practical, reasonably inexpensive interrogators. The simplest inductively-coupled transponders, like the Luftwaffe aircraft, transmit only 1 bit signaling their presence. A compact, low-cost transponder of this type may be constructed using a strip of magnetically sensitive metal mechanically resonant at the frequency at which the interrogator operates, so that when the transponder is placed near a reader antenna, it vibrates and extracts energy from the antenna.  A second strip, whose magnetization can be changed, is placed adjacent to the ﬁrst and used to detune the transponder when, for example, the associated object has been purchased.  Such transponders were developed in the 1960s for the purpose of preventing theft of retail goods and are still in wide use.  The reader unfamiliar with inductive coupling may ﬁnd it useful to view the animation “Inductive and Radiative Coupling” on the CD accompanying the book.  A transponder with a larger potential ID space, but still inexpensive and compact and with no need for a battery, may be achieved by using a resonant circuit composed of a capacitor and inductor which together determine a unique frequency at which a large current ﬂows through the transponder. The resonant frequency can be readily varied by adjusting the values of the components. Charles Walton, among others, patented several types of inductive identifying transponders in the early 1970s; an example is depicted in Figure 2.4. The reader sweeps over a range of frequencies containing the resonant frequency of the tag and detects a relatively  Figure 2.4: Resonant Circuit Coupled to a Reader Coil Acts as an Identifying Tag; After Walton, US Patent 3,752,960.  12   History and Practice of RFID  abrupt change in the voltage across the coil when the tag resonance is encountered. Such a system can convey more than 1 bit since the resonant frequency of the tag can be used as an identifying means, and one tag may display multiple resonances, allowing for a reasonably large ID space.  Tags of this type were used in one of the ﬁrst major commercial implementations of RFID technology by the Schlage Lock Company around 1972–1973. Several million electronic keys, using multiple resonators in the 3–32 MHz region, were produced.  To fabricate a more sophisticated identifying tag, we’d like to add some circuitry to per- form logical operations, but this requires electrical power. The usual way of providing such power, a battery, represents a signiﬁcant addition of cost and complexity in many applications. Instead, we can use the transmitted radio-frequency signal both as a means of communica- tion and a power source, by rectifying it: passing the alternating-polarity signal through a diode, which only conducts current in one direction. Extraction of DC from RF had already been envisioned in  for example  Crump’s work in the 50s, and by the early 70s Cardullo and Parks showed how this approach could be applied to power a more modern bit of circuitry  Figure 2.5 . A diode and capacitor  to store some of the resulting current and so smooth out the ﬂuctuations in the output voltage  are used to extract power from the received signal; this power is then used to process the signal and produce a reply. In practice, a regulating function is also necessary to account for the wide variations in signal strength likely to be encountered when the distance between the transponder and the reader antenna varies.  Though much identiﬁcation activity in this period was taking place at relatively low frequen- cies, the UHF band was not ignored. Work had begun at Sandia National Laboratories in  Figure 2.5: Extraction of DC Power From RF Power; After Cardullo and Parks, US Patent 3,713,148.  13   Chapter 2  Figure 2.6: An Early UHF Passive Tag System; After Koelle et al.

In this work, we see many features of modern UHF RFID systems. The tag is powered by rectiﬁcation of the received radio signal. The load impedance of the antenna is changed in order to modify the reﬂected signal and thereby send information to the reader. The tag uses a subcarrier modulation scheme; that is, the tag antenna impedance is switched at 20 kHz, and the degree of modulation of the antenna impedance is small for a binary ‘0’ and large for a binary ‘1’. Subcarrier modulation is slow because many switching cycles are used to send one binary bit, but it is simple to implement and relatively robust to noise because the reader has multiple signal transitions to examine to determine the nature of each bit. The ID code generator in this implementation provided only 3 bits, but the size of the ID space was mainly limited by the power consumption of the circuitry rather than the approach.  The reader uses a homodyne detection scheme, about which we will have more to say in Chapter 4. In this scheme, the received signal is mixed with a portion of the transmitted  14   History and Practice of RFID  signal since it is expected that both will be at the same frequency  if the tag is moving slowly, so that Doppler shifts can be ignored . The result of the mixing operation is the information signal itself  the baseband , in contradistinction to conventional heterodyne radio receivers, where multiple mixing steps are required to reduce the carrier frequency to zero. It is worth noting that the authors describe their work as being directed towards animal identiﬁcation, and other references suggest that the original motivation was the preservation of cowhide otherwise defaced by branding. The frequency of the subcarrier was purposely made tempe- rature sensitive to provide a simple temperature sensor, which the authors anticipated using to monitor an animal’s health. As we will learn in Section 2.5, sticking a UHF tag on animal tissue is not necessarily the best use of this technology; animal identiﬁcation today is mostly done using much lower frequencies and inductive coupling.  The system described by Koelle and coworkers provided read ranges of a few meters using a 1 GHz, 4-watt signal. Koelle noted that much longer ranges could be obtained if the tag had its own source of power. Note also that the electronics available at this time didn’t allow for writing new information to the tag, which doesn’t do much other than broadcast its ID continuously when powered up.  Higher microwave frequencies were also explored in the early 70s. For example, work done by Klensch and coworkers at RCA Laboratories involved a very simple tag contain- ing a high-frequency diode and a rather clever antenna, printed onto a piece of metal just about the same size as an automobile license plate, which of course this technology was designed to supplement. The tag was illuminated by a microwave transmitter operating at around 8–9 GHz. When a radio signal at any frequency f is applied to a diode, a signiﬁ- cant amount of power is obtained at a frequency of 2f, the second harmonic of the original signal. By varying the bias voltage on the diode, the amount of second-harmonic power generated could be varied. The resulting signal, at around 17 GHz, was captured in a receiver and demodulated to identify the tag. Because the return signal is at a different frequency from the transmitted signal, it is relatively easy to detect. However, other technologies have supplanted this approach for automated identiﬁcation of vehicles.  2.3 Making and Selling: Tracking Big Stuff  A recurring theme in the business of RFID is the basic economics of identiﬁcation: you can’t spend more identifying an object than the object is worth. As a consequence, applica- tions generally involve either very expensive objects or very cheap tag technologies.  By the early 1970s, the rapidly decreasing cost of electronic components had lead to the demonstration of more sophisticated identifying systems using inductive coupling, UHF backscatter radios, and microwave radios, as described in Section 2.2 above. One of the  15   Chapter 2  obvious applications of such noncontact identifying technologies was trafﬁc management because automobiles and trucks are expensive, mobile, and uniquely identiﬁed with an owner or owners. The application of RFID techniques to trafﬁc control at this time was nicely sum- marized in an article by William Arnold, published in Electronics in September 1973. After reviewing some of the major pilot projects, Mr. Arnold provides a remarkably prescient list of the applications envisioned for RFID: toll collection, toll parking, dynamic trafﬁc control, vehicle identiﬁcation, trucking location, and surveillance.  The implementation of these visions was largely constrained by barriers of cost, regulation, and institutional risk, though early observers were also already concerned about driver privacy. The main solution to the obstacle of cost was time: during the 1970s and 1980s semiconductor manufacturing improved dramatically and the cost of virtually all electronic goods fell commensurately.  One of the ﬁrst major adopters of RFID technology in this area was the rail industry in the United States. This far-ﬂung industry was faced with the problem of keeping track of tens of thousands of railcars across tens of thousands of kilometers of track made more challenging by the fact that companies often swapped cars in order to avoid paying to move empty cars. In the 1970s, the railways tried to make use of a circular bar code identiﬁer, but optical identi- ﬁcation in the rainy, muddy, snowy outdoors didn’t work very well.  In fact, it was the railcar identiﬁcation problem that Mr. Cardullo relates as triggering his earliest work in RFID.  Railroads represent a particularly favorable problem for a passive RFID solution: trains travel on tracks, so the qualitative location of any railcar can be inferred if its presence at a limited number of choke points is known. Further, the location of the cars at these choke points is well controlled by the tracks, so only one reader is needed for each track. The industry is mature and follows uniform practices across the continental United States. Finally, railcars are fairly expensive assets, so the cost of the transponders was not a signiﬁcant barrier to adoption. By the late 1980s, the rail industry established a standard for railcar identiﬁcation  AAR S-918 , based on a backscatter transponder operating in the United States industrial, scientiﬁc, and medical  ISM  band at 902–928 MHz. The standard envisions both active and passive tags, but in practice, passive tags are used because their short read range of around 3 m is desirable to avoid counting cars on neighboring tracks. By 1994, essentially all railcars in the United States were equipped with S-918 compliant transponders  Figure 2.7 .  Progress has been slower in automobile identiﬁcation. A few narrowly focused implementa- tions in the early 1980s, such as the Coronado Bridge in San Diego, California, demonstrated the feasibility of UHF radio trafﬁc management. Around the same time, Philips Electronics developed an inductive system known as V-com V-tag, requiring antennas embedded in the roadways and mainly useful to track buses or other large vehicles following repetitive routes. In order to encourage adoption in the United States, Amtech Corp. provided most of the  16   History and Practice of RFID  Figure 2.7: Example of Typical Passive Tag and Reader Antenna for Identiﬁcation of Railcars.  funding for implementation of automated tolling on the North Dallas Turnpike in 1989. This effort was successful enough to get the ball rolling in the United States. The EZpass inter- agency group was formed in 1990 to promote automated tolling in the Eastern United States. Open-highway automated tolling was implemented in Oklahoma in 1991, and the title 21 standard was promulgated for use in California and the Western United States in 1992. Use of the transponders is not legally required but is encouraged by special toll lanes and faster passage through lines; adoption is reported to be several million vehicles at the time of this writing, a large number but still a small percentage of the total.  Probably the most advanced implementation of RFID for trafﬁc management can be found in the city-state of Singapore, where urban crowding and congestion are magniﬁed by the geographical constraints of the tiny state. In the 1970s and 1980s, a paper licensing scheme was in use to provide rights to drive in the downtown areas, but this was inﬂexible and expensive to administer. In 1991, the government of Singapore initiated a program to auto- mate tracking and payment. After several years of development, they settled on a system using powered backscatter transponders operating at 2.45 GHz, developed primarily by Philips Electronics and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Smart payment cards are used to allow anonymous transactions and preserve driver privacy. Clearly marked gantries above roadways leading into the downtown areas signify when the system is active; payments are deducted from the smart card as the car passes below the gantry, and the license plates of violators are automatically photographed. The system demonstrated a very low missed-read rate of a few per million cars in development testing. The system is active during heavy trafﬁc periods  17   Chapter 2  each day, using payments to discourage excessive travel in the most congested areas. The government had given some early consideration to instantaneous pricing to account for actual congestion conditions, but this scheme was rejected as too complex for practical implementa- tion. Adoption was encouraged by initial government ﬁnancing of transponder installation. The transponders are also widely used for payment of parking fees, just as Mr. Arnold had foreseen two decades previously. Implementation of this system was clearly assisted by unique circumstances: a single government with undiluted jurisdiction and relatively broad powers, a well-deﬁned trafﬁc problem in a small geographic area, and high vehicle costs due to existing government practices, as well as consideration of privacy concerns early in the project.  As noted in Section 2.2, the work at Sandia Laboratories was partially directed towards livestock management. Cows are high-value assets and may be allowed to range over large areas to ﬁnd feed, and the cattle industry in the United States is highly fragmented, with many ranchers in a speciﬁc geographical region providing cattle to a smaller number of auction locations and slaughterhouses. Tracking of ownership of the animals is of commer- cial importance. In addition, particularly since the appearance of human-transmissible bovine spongiform encephalopathy  ‘mad cow’ disease , it has been of considerable interest to be able to trace individual animals so that tainted meats can be speciﬁcally recalled from human use. Traditional means of branding animals waste hide and are not readily automa- ted. In these applications, use of frequencies around 100 kHz and inductive coupling turns out to be preferable because at these frequencies the water in the tissues of an animal has little effect on the radio operation  although cows apparently don’t like to line up, so the short range of these transponders is a challenge . Work in the 1980s led to a standards effort initiated at the International Organization for Standardization  ISO  in 1991, resulting in approval of the ISO 11784 and 11785 standards in 1996, recently updated as ISO 14223. Transponders can be attached to an animal’s ear or hide, injected under the skin, or in the case of cows swallowed and embedded within the stomach. The beef industries in Canada and Australia are actively encouraging implementation of RFID. Inexpensive inductive transponders are also now widely available for insertion in pets  and humans, apparently stylish in at least one Spanish resort .  Invented around 1956, the use of multi mode shipping containers revolutionized worldwide logistics over the next three decades. Standardized shipping containers now carry goods on trucks, trains, or ships. A typical container costs a few thousand dollars and carries tens of thousands of dollars worth of goods. Around 18 million containers are currently in use throughout the world. Identifying and locating these containers and their contents using paper manifests is awkward, labor-intensive, and wasteful, as the United States Department of Defense  DOD  found during its 1991 actions in response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. In subsequent years, the DOD has made extensive use of radio identiﬁcation and location  18   History and Practice of RFID  using battery-powered transponders from Savi Technologies, which operate under the ANSI 371.2 standard at 433 MHz  ISO 18000-7 , and identify a container’s location and contents, as well providing some tamper protection. A similar solution, operating at 2.4 GHz based on ANSI 371.1, was developed by another company, Wherenet, in the 1990s and serves commercial tracking requirements.  People are important, mobile, and expensive  as any parent knows , so identifying and tracking them can make economic sense. Tracking of people using radio technology has become practical in the 1990s and has been implemented in several special circumstances. Many corporate employees now carry short-range radio badges, typically using inductively coupled transponders, to allow admission into company facilities. Similar technologies are used in smart payment cards, noted above in connection with the Singapore trafﬁc control project and also seen increasingly used in retail applications. These cards are usually com- pliant with ISO standards, typically ISO 14443 or ISO 15693. Prisoners can be tracked using active tags  obviously using anti tamper provisions to avoid tag removal . Children and family members can be tracked in theme parks. Wider implementation of RFID for people tracking runs squarely into issues of privacy, surveillance, and security, which are important but beyond the scope of this book save for a few remarks in the Afterword, and the citations therein.  2.4 Tracking Small Stuff: AutoID and The Web of Things  As noted brieﬂy above, by the 1960s simple bimetallic tags were available for 1-bit monitor- ing functions usable for theft prevention in retail. These tags have no electronics and are inexpensive, and because they carry only 1 bit of information, no data infrastructure is needed to implement them. They are practical to attach to low-value assets and are widely used. Very simple electronic frequency doublers, again carrying only 1 bit of information, are also available for this application.  More sophisticated tags that simultaneously provided low-cost solutions for tagging indivi- dual stuff with large ID spaces had to wait for the availability of inexpensive, low-power integrated circuits. By the early 1990s, it had become possible to implement a simple communications protocol and store a reasonably large identifying number on a single integrated circuit. The circuit could be attached to an inductive antenna  a few loops of wire formed by photolithographic techniques on a plastic substrate  to create a low-cost transponder capable of attachment onto an item or box. Several companies developed low-cost inductive identiﬁcation systems, notably Texas Instruments’ Tag-IT and Philips u-code products, and these systems were successful in many closed-loop applications  those where the required information is contained within a single organization , ranging from tracking library books to beer kegs. More general applications throughout the retail supply  19   Chapter 2  chain were inhibited by the relatively high cost of the tags  around US$1–3  and by the number of incompatible standards and proprietary implementations.  A broader vision for the implementation of RFID was triggered by MIT researcher David Brock in 1998. Brock was working on the seemingly unrelated problem of robotic vision: how does a robot navigate through a room or building and identify and manipulate the objects it ﬁnds therein? Brock realized that this task would become a lot easier if the objects were all uniquely identiﬁable by some other means, such as RFID. To be useful, such a system would need to be widespread and inexpensive. Brock’s MIT colleagues Sanjay Sarma, Sonny Siu, and Eric Nygren extended their observation to the idea of an ubiquitous and globally unique electronic product code  EPC  to identify every manufactured object, along with a software infrastructure to provide access to information about the object so identiﬁed. Assisted by supporters in industry, notably Kevin Ashton of Proctor and Gamble, and Alan Haberman of UCC  the consortium administering bar code identiﬁcation for retail products , in 1999 MIT launched the Auto-ID Center. Over the next 3 years, the center added research facilities at the University of Cambridge in the U.K., the University of Adelaide in Australia, Keio University and Fujan University in Japan, and the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland.  Through the activities of the Auto-ID laboratories, Sarma and coworkers promoted several concepts related to ubiquitous RFID. A tag should be as simple  and thus cheap  as possible, foregoing encryption of the data, complex collision resolution protocols, and extra memory beyond the EPC and error correction. A standardized infrastructure should exist, analogous to the Domain Name Service that forms the basis of the World Wide Web, to locate informa- tion about an object whose EPC is known. A markup language based on Hypertext Markup Language, the scheme used to deﬁne the appearance of web pages, should be deﬁned to describe the characteristics of an object. Specialized software agents, originally known as Savants, would act to reduce the undifferentiated mass of data generated by RFID readers to a smaller comprehensible collection of meaningful events in the life of a box. Finally, after some examination of the various alternative approaches, the Auto-ID Labs emphasized RFID tags operating in the 900-MHz regime as the best compromise of cost, read range, and capabi- lity and created a hierarchy of classes of tags with increasing capabilities  but also increasing cost . Two startup companies, Matrics  later acquired by Symbol Technologies and that in turn by Motorola  and Alien Technology, became involved in the period 2000–2002, mixing Auto-ID Center concepts with their own technology to form the two “ﬁrst-generation” air- interface standards for Class 0 and Class 1 tags.  To support wide dissemination of the technology and concepts developed within the Auto-ID centers increasingly required the participants to stretch the boundaries of what was appropriate in an academic environment. By 2002, it was apparent that a new organiza- tional basis was needed, and in 2003, EPCglobal Inc. was founded as joint venture of the  20   History and Practice of RFID  administrators of the international bar code system, then UCC and EAN  now merged into the GS1 organization . EPCglobal is a nonproﬁt corporation charged with promulgation of supply-chain RFID standards, advancement of public policy, and support for training, marketing, and implementation of RFID.  One of the ﬁrst major activities taken up by EPCglobal was the resolution of the UHF air- interface conundrum created by the earlier activities of the Auto-ID center. The Class 0 and Class 1 standards mandate the use of EPCs for identiﬁcation and both use the 860- to 960-MHz bands, but they are otherwise wholly incompatible in modulation, packet deﬁni- tion, collision resolution, and just about any other protocol property. This was just the situation Sarma had set out to eliminate 4 years before. It was apparent that a second- generation standard needed to be deﬁned that would be reasonably neutral for the existing players in the industry and ﬂexible enough to cover most applications without introducing mutual incompatibility. A hardware action group was formed early in 2004 to create such a standard, and in a remarkable marathon  at least by the standards of standards setting  was able to reach agreement on a completely new protocol for passive UHF tags by the end of 2004. This Generation 2 protocol, about which the reader will have the opportunity to learn more than they probably want to know in Chapter 8, was ratiﬁed with minor modiﬁcations by the International Organization for Standardization as ISO 18000-6C in 2006, and may become the basis for a globally accepted protocol for conversing with passive RFID tags.  Roughly coincident with the formation of EPCglobal, Wal-Mart, at that time and this the world’s largest retailer, brought its activities in the RFID arena to the attention of the world by mandating that its top 100 suppliers would need to provide RFID tags on all cases and pallets delivered to Wal-Mart by January of 2005. The next 100 suppliers would need to follow by January 2006. While some of the expectations for system performance advertised at that time turned out to be unrealistically optimistic, both these mandates have been met as of the time of this writing, and such data as have been made public suggest that the investment has been worthwhile for Wal-Mart, though perhaps less obviously so for its vendors. Wal- Mart’s announcement was soon followed by similar mandates from other large retailers: Tesco, Metro, and Target. The United States DOD, which as noted above had already made extensive use of RFID in tracking shipping containers, also mandated that high-value cases should be RFID-tagged by 2005, though serious enforcement of those provisions seems to have begun only late in 2006.  The ferment surrounding this association of large amounts of money with radio-frequency identiﬁcation has created a considerable increase in participation by vendors, integrators, and ordinary folks who might buy the stuff but has had the unfortunate consequence of obscuring key distinctions between the various technological approaches to identiﬁcation by radio. We have alluded in passing to these issues above; let us now pause in reﬂection on the past and  21   Chapter 2  delve into the details of how the veil of objective anonymity is stripped aside by an invisible vibration in a nonexistent ether.  2.5 RFID Systems and Terminology  An archetypal RFID system consists of an interrogator, more often known as a reader, a transponder or tag, and antennas to mediate between voltages on wires and waves in air  Figure 2.8 . The reader antenna or antennas may be integrated with the reader or physically separate and connected with a cable; the tag antenna is generally physically integrated with the tag. Most tags have at least one integrated circuit  IC , often known as a silicon chip, containing the tag ID and the logic needed to navigate the protocol that guides discussions between the tag and reader. There are tag technologies that do not use silicon ICs, though we will touch only peripherally on them in this book. The reader may contain a user interface of its own but more often will be connected to a network or a particular host computer, which interacts with the user to control the reader, and stores and displays the resulting data.  A link in radio parlance is the data-carrying connection that exists between a speciﬁc radio transmitter and receiver. Although they occupy the same physical space and generally use the same antennas, engineers often distinguish between the communications channel carrying information from the reader to the tag—the downlink or forward link—and that carrying information from the tag to the reader—the uplink or reverse link. In a real application, it is not unlikely that multiple tags will be present in the neighborhood of the reader, and also possible that many readers will be located in close proximity to one another.  Readers and tags usually live in a larger world of information storage and handling, from which point of view, an RFID reader is just another sensor, sharing that position with bar code  Figure 2.8: Overview of RFID System.  22   History and Practice of RFID  scanners, keyboards, touch screens, and other data collection apparatus  Figure 2.9 . In a small organization, this infrastructure might consist of a database running on the local host or even a spreadsheet that just records the list of unique tag reads. In a large organization or company, operating activities are managed by a much bigger database, often known as an enterprise resource planning system  ERP , manufacturing resource planning  MRP , or perhaps a warehouse management system  WMS , depending on the context. Because an RFID system is likely to distinguish between speciﬁc individual objects rather than just between classes of objects, it may generate a lot more data than traditional tracking systems. A whole class of software applications, generically known as RFID middleware, is arising to provide a bridge between the ERP database and business processes and the newfangled RFID equipment. Though this matter is not a topic of the present volume, it is important for the reader to realize that the mere collection of data is not equivalent to the production of useful information, and the implementation of an infrastructure of RFID readers and tags should be regarded as the enabler for improvements in information handling and business processes that create improved efﬁciency, rather than an end in itself.  Figure 2.9: RFID as a Sensor Within an Overall Software Infrastructure.  23   Chapter 2  2.6 Types of RFID  We have alluded to key aspects of RFID systems in our discussion of the history of the technology in Sections 2.1–2.4 above. RFID systems are crucially distinguished by the frequ- ency of the radio waves they use, by the means used to provide power to the tags, and by the protocols used to communicate between tag and reader. The choice of frequency, power source, and protocol has important implications for range, cost, and features available to the user.  2.6.1 Frequency Bands for RFID  RFID systems use frequencies varying by a factor of 20 000 or more, from around 100 kHz to over 5 GHz  Figure 2.10 . Systems rarely operate arbitrarily across this vast swath of spectrum; most of the activity is concentrated in fairly narrow bands that have been made available by regulators for unlicensed industrial activities. The most commonly encountered frequency bands are the 125 134 kHz3, 13.56 MHz, 860–960 MHz, and 2.4–2.45 GHz. The 125 134 kHz systems operate within the low-frequency  LF  band and are often referred to as LF tags and readers. Readers at 13.56 MHz operate in the high-frequency band and are thus similarly characterized as HF systems. Readers and tags in the 900-MHz region and at  Figure 2.10: RFID Frequency Bands.  3 The reference here to two frequencies differing by 9 kHz is related to the means used by some protocols to  communicate, in which these two frequencies are used to denote differing binary bits  a frequency-shift keying scheme .  24   History and Practice of RFID  2.4 GHz are both within the ultra-high-frequency  UHF  band, which formally ends at 3 GHz, but in order to make a convenient distinction between these two, 900-MHz readers and tags are often referred to as UHF devices, whereas 2.4 GHz systems are known as microwave readers.  Corresponding to the range in frequency is a huge range in wavelength. Recall that electromagnetic waves travel in vacuum at the speed of light  and almost as fast in air , c = 300000 km s. The wavelength is the distance between successive peaks or trough of the wave, and so is the ratio of the speed of propagation c to the frequency f: mathema- tically speaking,  λ = c f   2.1   Thus a wave with a frequency of 300 000 Hz  300 kHz  will have a wavelength of  300000 km s   300000 peaks s  = 1 km. The wavelengths in common use in RFID range from about 2000 m—comparable to a sizable mountain unless you live in Tibet or Chile—to about 12 cm. The antenna sizes used in RFID have no comparable range of variation: an antenna is always about human sized, with the largest ones around 1 m indiameter and the smallest 1–4 cm. As a consequence, RFID systems can also be categorized by whether the wavelength is comparable in size to the antenna or vastly larger than the antenna.  Systems where the wavelength is much larger than the antenna are typically inductively coupled: almost all the available energy from the reader antenna is contained within a region near the reader antenna and comparable to it in size, falling away as the cube of distance or faster as we move away  Figure 2.11 . Within this region, communication between tag and reader is effectively instantaneous since the propagation time to the tag is a small fraction of the time for a complete cycle of the RF voltage. In the ﬁgure, even at the distance of 1.5 m from the antenna  where there is not really enough power to run the tag , the delay is only about 4 ns, about 6% of the RF cycle at 13.56 MHz, which is about 74 ns. Under these cir- cumstances, it is difﬁcult to speak of a separate transmitted and backscattered wave. Instead, we think of changes in the tag antenna as inducing changes in the electrical impedance of the reader antenna: the reader—tag system acts as a magnetic transformer providing coupling between the current ﬂowing in the reader and the voltage across the tag.  Systems where the antenna is comparable in size to the wavelength usually use radiative coupling to communicate between the reader and tag. The reader antenna launches a traveling electromagnetic wave, whose intensity in the absence of obstacles falls off as the square of the distance traveled. The wave interacts with the tag antenna at some distinguishably later time much longer than a single RF cycle  here 11 ns later, vs. an RF cycle of about 1.1 ns , and a faint replica of the transmitted signal is provided to the tag. A distinct scattered wave returns  25   Chapter 2  Figure 2.11: Inductive Coupling  13.56 MHz, 50 cm diameter antenna  vs. Radiative Coupling  900 MHz , With Associated Power and Time Delays.  to the reader; the total round-trip transit time, about 22 ns in the example shown, is much longer than the RF cycle time.  The reader unfamiliar with these terms may ﬁnd it useful to view the animation “Inductive and Radiative Coupling” on the CD accompanying the book.  The distinction between inductive and radiative coupling has important implications for the behavior of RFID tags. As suggested in Figure 2.11, inductive coupling between the reader and tag falls rapidly as the tag moves away from the reader antenna. A quantitative example is shown in Figure 2.12. This simulation estimates the mutual inductance of a large circular coil representing a reader antenna and a smaller coil representing a simpliﬁed tag antenna.  The voltage induced on the tag IC is proportional to the mutual inductance for a ﬁxed reader current.  It is clear that the coupling is uniformly large when the tag is close to the reader, but the coupling falls rapidly to near zero in all directions for distances large compared to the antenna. Insertion of a metallic object near the reader antenna will distort the ﬁelds but in a fairly smooth fashion, and on a length scale comparable to that of the obstacle. The read range of an inductive tag is roughly comparable to the size of the reader antenna and dependent on the direction of displacement relative to the antenna  and the relative orientation  26   History and Practice of RFID  Figure 2.12: Calculated Mutual Inductance  nanoHenry  of Circular Coil Antennas as the Smaller Antenna Moves in a Plane Relative to the Larger Antenna.  of the tag and reader, not shown here . To a good approximation, when an inductive tag is close to the antenna, it will be reliably read, and when the tag is far from the antenna, it is invisible to the reader.  The situation is very different when radiative coupling is used. Because the power falls slowly with distance, and the wavelength is small compared to typical tag-reader distances, reﬂections from distant obstacles can propagate back into the region of interest and interfere with the waves launched by the reader antenna, creating a very complex dependence of received power on location of the tag. An example is shown in Figure 2.13, depicting the relative power received by a tag antenna from a reader placed within a simple rectangular room with partially reﬂecting walls and ﬂoor, and no other obstacles.  The reader antenna is taken to be omnidirectional; see Chapter 6.  The received power falls monotonically near the transmitter  reader , but for distances greater than about 1 m, the propagation environment becomes very complex.  Moving a tag away from the reader antenna by distances on the order of half a wavelength may lead to an increase in received power; in consequence, a radiatively-coupled tag may disappear and then reappear  perhaps several times  to the reader as it travels away from the  27   Chapter 2  Figure 2.13: Simple Model of Power Density in a Room with Partially Reﬂecting Walls and Floor.  antenna. Furthermore, this large and complex read zone will overlap with other similarly unpredictable zones when multiple readers are present in close proximity to one another: interference is more likely with long-range UHF systems than short-range HF or LF systems. The read range of a radiatively coupled system can be longer than an inductively coupled system, but at the cost of a much more complex propagation environment, and a discon- tinuous and unpredictable read zone.  The frequency of operation has a major impact on the type of antennas used. A by-no-means- exhaustive set of examples of the various tag antenna conﬁgurations used at differing frequencies is shown in Figure 2.14.  28   History and Practice of RFID  Figure 2.14: Examples of Tag Antenna Conﬁguration Designed for Different Operating Frequencies.  Inductive-coupled systems use coils for antennas. The voltage induced on a coil is propor- tional to the number of turns of the coil, the size of the coil, and the frequency of operation. Thus at 125 kHz, a typical tag antenna requires tens to over a hundred turns of wire to pro- duce a suitable voltage for IC operation; small tags, such as those implanted into animals and humans, may also use a ferrite core to increase the inductance of the coil. Such antennas must be mechanically constructed using a winding machine and are thus relatively expensive. Antennas with fewer turns can be used but with a concomitant reduction in read range. Reader antennas are sized by the range desired and may also involve 10–20 turns of wire. At 13 MHz, 100 times higher in frequency, a typical credit card form factor tag requires only 3–6 turns to produce several volts at a reasonable range of a few tens of centimeters. This  29   Chapter 2  type of antenna can be fabricated in batch using lithographic techniques. Reader antennas at HF usually use only a single coil.  Coils  loop antennas  a few centimeters in diameter are not very effective antennas at UHF frequencies. Most UHF microwave tags use variants of a dipole design, essentially a wire split in the middle, about which much more will be said in Chapter 7. A dipole antenna has a natural size of about half the wavelength, roughly 15 cm at 900 MHz, or 6 cm at 2.4 GHz. Smaller dipole-like antennas can be used but at a sacriﬁce of either bandwidth or performance or both. Operation at 2.4 GHz allows for compact dipole antennas, but for reasons, we will discuss in Chapters 6 and 7, and 2.4-GHz tag antennas collect less power than a similar 900-MHz tag for the same radiated power, so the read range of 2.4 GHz tags is in general shorter than that of 900-MHz tags. Some UHF tags use small loop antennas and couple induc- tively despite high frequency operation, but these tags are limited to short-range operation  typically 5–10 cm read range .  When we change the frequency of operation, we also change the way the ﬁelds created by the reader antenna interact with materials commonly encountered in use, particularly metallic objects and water  of which people, plants, and animals are mostly constructed . An electro- magnetic wave impinging on a conductive object penetrates to an extent known as the skin depth. The skin depth δ depends on the frequency f, the magnetic permeability μ = μ0 except for magnetic materials, and the electrical conductivity σ of the object in question:   cid:2   δ =  1  πμ0σf   2.2   Approximate values for the skin depth in differing materials at the most common RFID fre- quencies are given in Table 2.1.  The values for water and animal tissue are rough estimates because the frequency dependence of the ionic conductivity has not been accounted for.  It is apparent that at 125 kHz, water and water-containing materials have essentially no effect on RFID operation, and that a thin sheet of metal is readily tolerated, but a thick metallic sheet  Table 2.1: Skin Depth for Various Common Materials.  125 kHz  13.56 MHz  900 MHz  Skin Depth At  Material  Tap water  Animal tissue Aluminium  Copper −6 m  1μm = 10  8 m 2 m  0.23 mm 0.18 mm  2 m 60 cm 71 μm 55 μm  30  4 cm 2 cm 2.7 μm 2.1 μm  2.4 GHz 8 mm 8 mm 1.6 μm 1.3 μm   History and Practice of RFID  acts as an effective shield. At 13.56 MHz, penetration into cows or people is substantial but not unlimited, and only thin metal ﬁlms can be tolerated.  This doesn’t mean that 13 MHz tags are insensitive to water. A 13-MHz tag can be surrounded by your hand with no effect, but if the tag comes into contact with your skin, the high dielectric permeability of the tissue changes the capacitance of the coil and greatly reduces readability.  At UHF frequencies, penetration through water is minimal, and all but the thinnest metallic ﬁlms are obstacles to propagation.  Finally, as we will discuss in more detail in Chapter 3, the amount of information you can send over a link is constrained by the amount of bandwidth you have available. This fact shows up as a limitation on the speed of data transfer for LF tags. For example, let us look at the popular scheme alluded to brieﬂy above, where transmission at 125 kHz or 135 kHz is used to send binary ‘0’ and ‘1’ symbols. In order to reliably distinguish between the two frequencies, the receiver must be able to count enough waves to tell what frequency is being sent, possibly from a small signal in the presence of noise. The length of a single cycle would have to be determined very accurately to distinguish between two frequencies separated by only 7%. If instead we send  say  10 cycles, an error of 10% of the cycle time in ﬁnding the peak of the last cycle only causes 1% error in measuring the frequency. So we might use 10 RF cycles in each bit to get good noise resistance, but this means that it takes us 10 times longer to send a bit. In general, LF tags send data very slowly: data rates around 1 kilobit per second  kbps  are typical, so merely to send an identifying number and error check with 100 bits would take 0.1 s, ignoring the overhead of operating an identiﬁcation protocol. LF tags are necessarily slow.  HF and UHF tags can operate at much higher speeds, though in this case, the data rate is often limited by regulatory restrictions on the amount of bandwidth available. In the United States, it is possible for a UHF tag to send data to a reader at hundreds of kbps, and HF tags regularly operate at 10 s of kbps. This is fast enough to exchange lots of data and operate complex anticollision protocols while still identifying tens of tags in less than a second, or one tag in a few milliseconds.  Let us brieﬂy review the consequences of the choice of frequency:           LF and HF operation involves inductive coupling and range comparable to antenna size; UHF operation provides range limited by transmit power  Inductively coupled read zones are generally small but simple; radiative read zones are larger but complex and often discontinuous, and nearby readers can interfere with each other  LF tags use coil antennas with many turns; HF antennas need fewer turns  31   Chapter 2    UHF tag use simple dipole-like antennas that are easily fabricated, but size tends to  be constrained by the wavelength of the radiation           LF radiation penetrates water and common aqueous materials to a distance much longer than the read range of a typical system; HF penetration into water is compa- rable to ordinary read ranges; UHF microwave penetration into water is negligible in comparison to typical read range in air, except for inductively coupled near-ﬁeld operation  LF radiation can penetrate thin layers of conductive metals; HF and UHF radiation are effectively shielded by even quite thin ﬁlms of metal  LF tags are limited to low data rate, whereas HF and UHF tags can supply tens or hundreds of kbps  The differing characteristics associated with each frequency band mean that the optimal applications are different for each band.  LF RFID is particularly appropriate for animal and human ID. Tags and readers are quite unaffected by the presence of water or salt or otherwise. Ranges of 1 m orless are accep- table and often desirable. Tags are relatively costly  a few US dollars , but this is not a major impediment to the identiﬁcation of expensive livestock, beloved pets, or important people. Tags can be attached to an animal’s ear, inserted in the stomach  in the case of a cow , or implanted beneath the skin using a glass-encapsulated transponder such as that depicted in Figure 2.14. It is usually straightforward to arrange for only one tag to be in the read zone at any given time; cows can be moved through a portal with room for only one animal at a time, and people and pets are generally inspected with a short-range handheld reader. People and animals don’t move very fast under conditions of interest for this sort of identiﬁcation, so several seconds are available to read a single tag, and low data rates are not a problem.  LF tags and readers are also popular for access control. Short-range LF readers can be imple- mented at very low cost, as signal frequencies of 100 kHz present very little challenge to modern digital circuitry. Tags can be implemented in a credit card form factor, with a several- turn coil antenna, and used as identiﬁcation badges allowing entry into secured facilities. Near-contact ranges of a few centimeters are acceptable, and ensure that only one badge is presented to the reader at any given time. LF tags are also used in a key-fob form factor, using a larger number of coil turns to compensate for the small size, to provide unique identiﬁcation of a driver to an automobile-mounted reader. Again, only one tag is present at a time, and a delay of on the order of 1 s is acceptable. LF tags are useful in robust identiﬁcation of metal compressed gas cylinders.  32   History and Practice of RFID  HF tags are widely used for noncontact smart cards, credit-card-like transponders that contain an IC and antenna and support secure ﬁnancial transactions. The rapid increase in tag power as the tag nears a reader means that a slight decrease in read range is sufﬁcient to provide the considerable power needed for cryptographic operations, so HF tags can readily carry out secure communications with a reader. Short range also helps ensure against interception and inadvertent activation of the cards when they are for example, contained in a user’s wallet or purse. High data rates can support a relatively complex exchange to allow a sophisticated ﬁnancial transaction to occur. Like LF systems, HF-equipped badges can also be used for access control. HF tags are also increasingly used in RFID-equipped passports and travel documents.  HF tags are also widely used for asset tracking and supply management. HF tags have ample ID space to support unique identiﬁcation of a considerable quantity of items. In an asset application, the short read range of HF systems can be a challenge, typically addressed by some combination of large-sized antennas, large form-factor tags, process constraints that force the items to pass sufﬁciently close to a reader, and handheld or portable readers. The availability of high power at short range means that HF tags can support large memory spaces, up to several thousand bytes, allowing a user to record a substantial amount of unique information on a tag in the ﬁeld. This capability is very useful when users need to interact with the tags when out of reach of networks or relevant databases.  UHF tags beneﬁt from the potential for long range. The relative simplicity of UHF antenna designs, which involve only a few features with no critical dimensions and no need for crossovers or multiple layers, help reduce the cost of fabrication. However, at least one component in the tag’s circuitry must operate at very high frequencies, which until recently added signiﬁcantly to the cost of the circuitry. UHF tags are widely used in automobile tolling and rail-car tracking, where ranges of several meters add considerable installation ﬂexibility. They are increasingly used in supply chain management, transport baggage tracking, and asset tracking, where the future potential for very low-cost tags is important, and relatively long range adds ﬂexibility in applications  at the cost of some ambiguity in locating the tags that are read . UHF tags equipped with batteries  about which more below  can have ranges of tens or hundreds of meters, and are used for tracking shipping containers and locating expensive individual assets in large facilities.  The distinction between UHF operation at 860–960 MHz and 2.4 GHz is rather more subtle than that between inductive and radiative systems. The worldwide regulatory environment in the 860- to 960-MHz region is very complex, as RFID at these frequencies competes directly with cellular telephony and other popular and important applications  Figure 2.15 , and different countries have made different choices about what can operate where. The 2.4- to 2.45-GHz band, on the other hand, is available for unlicensed operation in almost every  33   Chapter 2  Figure 2.15: Capsule Summary of Worldwide UHF RFID Band Allocations.  major jurisdiction but in consequence is also crowded with other devices so that interference is a major issue. As noted above, 2.4-GHz tags are in general smaller than 900-MHz tags making them more convenient to use and lower in cost but reducing read range  around 1–3 m at 2.4 GHz vs. 2–10 m at 900 MHz .  2.6.2 Passive, Semipassive, and Active Tags  We have noted already that it is often advantageous to eliminate the radio transmitter and battery from an RFID tag to save money and space. The presence or absence of these com- ponents forms the basis of a second means of classifying RFID systems, by the power source and capabilities of the tags  Figure 2.16 .  Passive tags have no independent source of electrical power to drive the circuitry in the tag and have no radio transmitter of their own. Passive tags depend on rectiﬁcation of the recei- ved power from the reader to support operation of their circuitry, and modify their interaction with the transmitted power from the reader in order to send information back from the tag. Semipassive tags, also known as battery-assisted passive tags, provide a local battery to power the tag circuitry but still use backscattered communications for the tag-to-reader  uplink  communications. Active tags have both a local power source and a conventional  34   History and Practice of RFID  Figure 2.16: Options for Tag Power Transmit Conﬁguration.  transmitter and are thus conﬁgured as conventional bidirectional radio communications devices.  A passive tag is shown in a bit more detail in Figure 2.17. An antenna structure interacts with impinging electromagnetic ﬁelds, producing a high-frequency  RF  voltage. The voltage is rectiﬁed by a diode  a device which only allows current to ﬂow in one direction , and the resulting signal is smoothed using a storage capacitor to create a more-or-less constant voltage that is then used to power the tag’s logic circuitry and memory access. Passive tag memory  35   Chapter 2  Figure 2.17: Schematic Depiction of Simple Passive RFID Tag.  circuitry is always nonvolatile since the tag power is usually off. A similar rectiﬁcation circuit, using a smaller capacitance value to allow the voltage to vary on the timescale of the reader data, is used to demodulate the information from the reader. This technique is known as envelope detection. Finally, to transmit information back to the reader, the tag changes the electrical characteristics of the antenna structure so as to modify the signal reﬂected from it, somewhat analogous to tilting a mirror. Here we have shown a ﬁeld-effect transistor  FET  used as a switch; when the FET is turned on, the antenna is grounded, allowing a large current to ﬂow, and when it is off, the antenna ﬂoats allowing very little antenna current. Real tags are a bit more sophisticated but use an essentially similar mecha- nism for modulation. The same conceptual scheme is used for all frequency bands, though the details of implementation differ for LF, HF, and UHF tags.  The tremendous advantage of a passive tag is its simplicity and consequent low cost. Passive tags have no battery, no crystal frequency reference, no synthesizer to create a high-frequency signal, no power ampliﬁer to amplify the synthesizer signal, and no low-noise ampliﬁer to  36   History and Practice of RFID  capture the reader signal. These functions are relatively expensive compared to logic circuitry and in some cases  e.g. a crystal , would require placement of a separate component onto the tag. Their elimination greatly reduces the cost of tag manufacture. Furthermore, because there is no battery, passive tags need no maintenance and last as long as the materials of which they are composed endure.  In exchange for this low cost, passive tags give up a lot. Read range is limited by the need to power up the circuitry and so is short relative to the range at which signals from the reader could be detected by the tag; the limitation is particularly acute at UHF, where propagation- limited read range might be large. The tags are also generally dumb. Because they depend on received RF for power, they must be designed to use very little of it. Computational power is minimized to avoid power consumption, so the readers must use very simple protocols to avoid overtaxing the tags, and integration of sensors is limited by the lack of power except when near a reader. Security and privacy are necessarily compromised due to the limited resources available to implement cryptographic algorithms, though this deﬁciency can be ameliorated for HF tags if short range is acceptable. Passive tags, particularly at UHF frequen- cies, are unreliable relative to more sophisticated systems: they won’t power up at all unless they receive a strong reader signal and are thus often not seen. Furthermore, the limited computational capability means that many of the techniques used to improve link quality for more capable radios, such as error-correcting codes, interleaving, gain adjustment, and retransmission, are not practical for passive tags.  An example of a typical UHF passive tag is shown in Figure 2.18. The tag is almost wholly composed of the plastic substrate or inlay and the antenna structure. The single very small IC is mounted on a strap  which conceals it from direct view in this image . The whole assembly is much less than 1 mm thick and can thus be used in applications where physically larger tags might be esthetically objectionable or subject to mechanical damage. The inlay is often  Figure 2.18: Typical Commercial Passive UHF Tag  Alien Technology Model 9238 ‘Squiggle’ .  37   Chapter 2  Figure 2.19: Schematic Depiction of Simple Semipassive Tag.  coated with an adhesive for ready attachment to an object or embedded within a printed adhesive label.  Incorporating a battery to power the tag circuitry produces a semipassive tag  Figure 2.19 . Circuit complexity and peak power consumption can greatly exceed that used in a passive tag, enabling the use of standard commercial ICs rather than solely custom designs. We have shown the use of simple envelope detection just as in the passive tag for acquiring reader data, but with the availability of a battery one can also consider adding high-frequency ampliﬁca- tion and other RF functions. The uplink still uses modulation of the antenna load to create a backscattered signal.  Semipassive tags can achieve ranges in the tens of meters to as much as 100 m and are much more reliable than passive tags in the sense that they are much more likely to respond to a valid interrogation. They are often used in automobile tolling applications  where a missed tag translates into missed revenue or an inappropriate citation  and in tracking of airplane parts and other high-value reusable assets. The tradeoff is that they require a battery with concomitant increases in size, cost, and maintenance requirements. Battery life is impro- ved by operating at very low duty cycle, and or using a detector circuit to keep most of the  38   History and Practice of RFID  system off except when a reader signal is probably present. In tolling applications, this limitation can be avoided at the cost of increased installation complexity, by providing power from the automobile electrical system, a scheme used in the Singapore trafﬁc control  ERP  system described in Section 2.3 above.  An example of semipassive tag is depicted in Figure 2.20. This is an automobile tolling tag of a type commonly used in the Western United States. The tag is about 9.5 wide and 1.5 cm thick. We have removed the cover in the view on the right of the ﬁgure to display the con- struction of the tag. This tag uses a number of commercial components instead of the single custom IC in the passive tag of Figure 2.18. This tag uses two separate antennas, one for receiving the signal from the reader and another for transmitting a return signal. The largest component is a lithium battery, which provides about 5 years of ordinary operation. When the battery is exhausted, the tag must be replaced, representing a signiﬁcant expense and administrative burden for the tolling authorities. A beeper is used to signal the driver that the exchange with the tolling authority has been successful. These tags are typically mounted on the windshields of cars and provide about 10 m of read range, sufﬁcient to allow >95% successful ID acquisition even at full highway speeds. A tag costs about US$20–$30.  Active tags are full-ﬂedged radios, with a battery, receiver, transmitter, and control circuitry  Figure 2.21 .  The active tag synthesizes a carrier signal using a local oscillator and crystal reference, so it can communicate within a speciﬁc frequency band and can use this capability to communicate in the presence of other tags by using different frequency channels  Figure 2.20: Commercial Semipassive Tag: External View  left  and Internal Circuitry  right .  39   Chapter 2  Figure 2.21: Schematic Depiction of Active Tag.   frequency-division multiplexing . An active tag can use amplitude modulation like passive or semipassive tags, but it can also transmit and demodulate more sophisticated phase-based modulations  phase-shift keying, PSK, frequency shift keying, FSK, and quadrature amplitude modulation, QAM , which can be more efﬁcient users of available spectrum and provide superior noise robustness. Active tags can use high-rate code-division multiple access  CDMA  techniques to allow reuse of the same frequency band by multiple tags. With signiﬁcant transmit power and ﬁltering and ampliﬁcation to provide good receive sensitivity, the read range of an active tag is measured in hundreds of meters or even in kilometers, depending on the environment, transmit power, and frequency bands used. Just as important, the increased link margins mean that active tags can be successfully used in environments where the tag-reader path is signiﬁcantly obstructed. For example, they are used to mark metal shipping containers and can be read even when the containers are stacked in close proximity to one another with no line of sight from reader to tag.  Active tags naturally suffer from the additional cost, size, and maintenance requirements of a full-ﬂedged radio. More components imply larger size or the cost of a custom radio chip design. In addition, an active transponder must be certiﬁed as an active radio emitter and must therefore meet regulatory standards for spectral purity, out-of-band emissions, and frequency  40   History and Practice of RFID  Figure 2.22: Commercial Active RFID Tag: External and Disassembled Views  Shielding Removed ; Photos from FCC Report.  accuracy, which are either inapplicable or relatively less stringent for passive and semipassive tags. The long read range can be detrimental, in the sense that the location of a tag is not well known simply because it has been read by a reader antenna of known location.  This problem can be addressed by using multiple receivers; by measuring relative time delays to the receivers, the tag can be located within a few meters across several hundred meters.   An example of an active tag is depicted in Figure 2.22. This is a commercial tag used in locating large assets, such as shipping containers. These types of tags cost about US$50 each, in quantities of a few thousand, at the time of this writing. The internal view demonstrates the relative complexity of an active tag  particularly, in contrast to the very simple passive tag of Figure 2.18 , and the relatively large battery needed. This particular tag type produces about 60 mW output power in the 2.4-GHz band, providing about 900 meter outdoor range. The communications protocol, ANSI 371.1, prescribes a pseudo-noise coded beacon, which in this  41   Chapter 2  cases occupies much of the 2.40- to 2.45-GHz unlicensed band. The coding permits unique detection of tags in the presence of interferers and accurate timing of the beacon. The rate at which beacons are transmitted can be varied from about two per second to once per hour; at a typical rate of one every 4 minutes, the battery is expected to last about 6 years. Triangulation at multiple receive antennas can locate a tag to within a few meters in an outdoor environment.  2.6.3 Communications Protocols  Every means of communication requires a protocol: an agreement on how information will be exchanged. Protocols must address what sort of signals will be used, what types of symbols are used, how they are combined to make meaningful data, and how the communications medium is allocated among contending parties.  Protocols may also need to deal with net- working issues like addressing and routing information, which are beyond the scope of our discussion and of most RFID systems.  For example, human speech can be considered to be a complex protocol with the following elements:        Symbols and coding: words are constructed using a small set of phonemes standard to each spoken language    Modulation: human speech uses an involved mixture of variations in tone and  loudness—that is, of differential amplitude and frequency  AM and FM  modulation;  Packet construction: words are assembled into statements  packets  according to a language grammar;    Medium allocation: in informal speech, people use a variant of carrier sense multiple access with collision detection  CSMA-CD : we talk when we feel like it, but if two folks talk at once, they detect the situation and wait a short but random time before trying again. Alternative rule sets are available; when operating under Robert’s Rules of Order, a large group of people remain silent, while a designated central authority allocates the medium  the ‘ﬂoor’  to a single speaker based on speech or gestures during a brief contention period.  A key aspect of all communications protocols is that they must be shared: if I speak only Mandarin and you understand only Finnish, conversation will be unproﬁtable even if both of us are the souls of courtesy, and rigorously adhere to the proper grammar and pronunciation of our respective tongues. With commercial communications devices, there are two paths to ensuring agreement on the details of the protocol: either both ends of the link are manufac- tured by the same vendor and guaranteed to interoperate or multiple vendors make products to an agreed-upon communications standard. Some standards are simply de facto, often the adoption by an industry of a particularly successful product from one vendor, but many are  42   History and Practice of RFID  Figure 2.23: Elements of a Typical RFID Communications Protocol.  codiﬁed by multivendor industry bodies, quasi-governmental authorities, or national governments. Among important standard-setting bodies in communications today are the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers  IEEE , the American National Standards Institute  ANSI , the ISO, the Internet Engineering Task Force  IETF , and speciﬁcally for RFID, EPCglobal Inc.  The action within a standards body typically takes place in committees and working groups, most of the members being volunteers. While a few of these folks participate simply because they are interested in the work, the majority are employees of companies or organizations with a perceived ﬁnancial stake in the outcome. As a consequence, an important part of standards setting is achieving a resolution that all the participating organizations can tolerate. A superior technology developed by one participant may be disadvantaged in a standards activity because of the concern that competitors may need to pay a royalty to the developing company to use it. For example, in the very popular IEEE 802.11b  WiFi  standard, two coding methods were provided, CCK and PBCC. It has been reported that CCK was included despite its unproven status at the time of the original standardization because PBCC was developed by Texas Instruments, and other companies were reluctant to be wedded to that approach, given TIs predilection for seeking licensing revenues. In practice, almost all 802.11b equipment has implemented CCK rather than PBCC. The ISO18000-6A and -6B  43   Chapter 2  standards  about which we shall have more to say in Chapter 8  are mutually incompatible despite originating from a nominally common process because the standards descend from distinct proprietary technologies, and no compromise was reached. EPCglobal class 0 and class 1, as noted before, share the same problem. Standards setting is a complex compromise of competing interests: vendors who may have large investments in speciﬁc technologies and associated patent portfolios from which they hope to proﬁt, competing vendors who don’t want to pay royalties, users who want the standard to serve their particular application require- ments, and favor multiple suppliers to keep prices low and ensure supply, governments seek- ing harmony with their own activities and other regulated users, and competing governments concerned about perceived hegemony. Standards activities often founder in their attempts to navigate this maze, or surrender and disseminate multiple incompatible solutions from which the market is supposed to identify a winner. On the other hand, a good standard can change the world: today, nearly every computer in existence is equipped with one or more Ethernet  IEEE 802.3  ports, and communicates with almost any other computer on the planet using transmission control protocol  TCP  running over Internet protocol  IP .  If the organizational challenges weren’t serious enough, standards bodies are faced with a multitude of technical alternatives, each choice implying different tradeoffs for different applications scenarios. For example, in most jurisdictions governments regulate the spectrum available for speciﬁc uses and put constraints on the operation of radio devices, so readers and tags have only a certain amount of bandwidth available to operate in. One would like to use this bandwidth efﬁciently to allow as many readers as possible to operate without interfering with one another, but the most bandwidth-efﬁcient methods of modulating signals require resources that are prohibitively expensive and power-hungry for passive tags. Tags can receive and decode amplitude-modulated signals readily, but amplitude modulation involves turning the transmitted power down some of the time, which is bad if this is also the power used to keep the tags running. Therefore, it becomes desirable to use very short ‘off’ pulses with the reader power on most of the time, but  as we will see in the next chapter  such coding techni- ques use spectrum very inefﬁciently and allow fewer readers in the same location. Every choice made in formulating a standard involves a similar balance of competing constraints, usually made in the absence of complete information since often only prototype devices or perhaps just simulations are available during the standards-setting activities.  The issue of forward and backward compatibility inevitably arises. Very few standards break completely new ground, so one must always evaluate the desirability of making a new stan- dard backward compatible to an existing standard or at least a subset thereof. Previous standards were generally formulated with more primitive technology and older applications, so backward compatibility usually involves compromising the potential of the new standard, but leverages existing hardware and software. Forward compatibility is even more challeng- ing: a good standard should have ﬂexibility to allow new applications, very frequently not  44   History and Practice of RFID  envisioned by the folks who make the standard. However, burdening a standard with every possible bell and whistle makes the resulting document difﬁcult to understand and implement and raises the cost of compliant devices. For example, compliant EPCglobal class 1 genera- tion 2 tags must be able to reply to a reader inquiry at data rates as high as 640 kbps and as low as 5 kbps: this capability makes them very ﬂexible but also inevitably raises the cost of manufacture above that of a simpler single data rate requirement.  Finally, ensuring compliance to the standard is always an issue when multiple vendors are present. Brief descriptions of a protocol may be ambiguous, and careful and rigorous stan- dards may be long and difﬁcult to read and comprehend. In practice, the protocols must be implemented by real people designing and building hardware, and writing software to run it, with organizational boundaries and competition standing in the way of information exchange. To ensure that different implementations of a standard can communicate with each other, it is useful to establish compliance tests and a certiﬁcation process, as well as application charac- teristics and conventions for data exchange.  In Table 2.2, we summarize some of the standard and proprietary physical-layer protocols used in RFID. Note that many additional standards exist to deﬁne higher-level issues such as the organization and meaning of the unique tag identiﬁer, and conformance test requirements.  Table 2.2: Some RFID Air Interface Protocols.

For example, ISO 11784 and 11785 are designed for identiﬁcation of livestock. A reader powers up nearby tags with a 50 ms unmodulated transmission at 134 kHz, and then  in the half-duplex option  listens for a frequency-modulated reply at 125 134 kHz. ISO 14443 supports smart cards at 13.56 MHz. This standard has two incompatible ﬂavors, A and B, one using 100%-deep pulse position modulation and the other 10%-deep on-off modulation to send commands to the tags. Type A uses a binary tree walk to resolve collisions between tags, whereas B uses a slotted-Aloha scheme. The reader may infer from the discussion above how these sorts of discrepancies arise. ISO 15693 also supports smart cards at 13 MHz but uses still another set of schemes for uplink, downlink, and collision resolution. California Title 21, designed for automobile toll collection, and EPCglobal class 0, designed for supply chain applications, both can operate within the United States ISM band at 902–928 MHz and both use frequency modulation to send data from the tag back to the reader, but Title 21 tags use 0.6 and 1.2 MHz frequency offsets, whereas EPCglobal class 0 tags instead use 2.2 and 3.3 MHz.  See Chapter 8 for explanations of some of the terms used above.   It should be apparent that most of the protocols in the table are mutually incompatible, even when they come from the same standards activity, though the degree of distinction does vary somewhat. In the majority of cases, a tag understands only one of these protocols, either because there is no need for interoperability, or to minimize tag cost and complexity. When applications require multiprotocol interoperability, the burden generally falls on the reader: readers are relatively small in number, expensive, provided with a power source, and computa- tionally capable. Multiprotocol capability is relatively easy to provide within a ﬁxed frequency band  a single column of the table . Crossing frequency boundaries is much more complex; as described above, changing bands may require completely differing antenna structures, have different read ranges and data rates, and may involve large ranges in transmit voltage and received signal strength.  2.7 The Internet of Things and UHF RFID  The reader who has made it this far will appreciate that the acronym RFID encompasses a broad range of distinct and often incompatible technologies, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Every potential application has a different mix of requirements and thus a differ- ent optimal technology to support it. No particular choice of technology will satisfy all users.  That being said, it is apparent that only a few types of applications can generate a demand for very large numbers of tags. The total number of industrial gas cylinders in the world is unlikely to exceed a few tens of millions in the foreseeable future; in contrast, the total  46   History and Practice of RFID  volume of corrugated cardboard manufactured for boxes and containers averages around 400 million square meters per day. Marking cases of goods, and eventually individual items, with RFID would involve a truly astronomical quantity of unique tags. The Internet of Things, should it come to pass, will encompass the largest number of uniquely human-labeled objects ever to exist.  As we have noted previously, the dominant barrier to implementing such a grandiose scheme is the cost of labeling, particularly of the tags. Passive tags, due to their simplicity of manufacture and zero maintenance, have a tremendous advantage in cost-sensitive applications. Printed- battery technologies do exist, but even were they to be widely implemented, the total energy thus made available is quite limited: batteries are volume storage devices, and printed ﬁlms have little volume. For example, today’s printed batteries provide around 10 mA-hours from a few square centimeters of area and are several hundred microns thick. While this is enough power to run a passive tag IC for hundreds of hours and thus provide several years of operation with good duty cycle management, it is entirely inadequate to support an active transmitter or computationally intensive data processing for more than a few hours. Tag with printed batteries will almost certainly look much more like enhanced passive tags than active radios.  Passive tags can be operated at any RFID frequency. LF and HF passive tags are very widely deployed in animal identiﬁcation, automobile immobilization, and smart card applications. However, LF tags will always be limited to very low data rates and are not appropriate for most supply chain applications. HF tags can support high data rates, can be very small, and can achieve read ranges of several meters—but not all at the same time. UHF tags are able to provide all these beneﬁts in a single package. While not all supply chain applications will require long read ranges, there is a tremendous beneﬁt in ﬂexibility gained from having a single tag and reader technology, with the option of reading the tag at a distance when needed. This versatility is a powerful argument for the use of UHF in supply-chain applications.  As we mentioned brieﬂy above and will discuss in detail in Chapter 7, operation at UHF is very sensitive to the presence of conductive materials: metals, metal ﬁlms, and aqueous solutions, all of which are very common in manufactured goods. HF tags are also sensitive to metals, though relatively tolerant of water. This proximity problem represents a signiﬁcant challenge for ubiquitous implementation of UHF RFID. To solve, it will require a mixture of approaches, including improved tag and reader designs, changes in packaging techniques, optimized procedures for suppliers and retailers, and perhaps semipassive tags in some instances. Insufﬁcient progress in this area could limit the broad use of UHF technology.  Chipless RFID technologies have also been explored. Surface-acoustic wave  SAW  devices have been implemented in some RFID applications, and electromagnetic techniques using resonant conductive ﬁbers are under active investigation. However, these approaches suffer  47   Chapter 2  from the inability to write data to the tag and must compete with the tremendous ﬂexibility offered by digital logic designs and the stupendous global manufacturing competence in silicon CMOS IC technology. Printed organic ICs have demonstrated improved capabilities, but it is important to note that the per-feature cost of printing technologies is considerably higher than that of silicon manufacturing: for the same complexity, it is cheaper to fabricate a circuit on silicon than to print it directly onto a plastic substrate. These constraints seem likely to limit chipless RFID technology to specialized applications where their potential for very low cost makes up for their relative inﬂexibility.  Finally, it is worth noting that at a certain point, low cost and ready availability often generate new markets of their own accord. Ethernet is everywhere in part because Ethernet is every- where. As UHF tags and readers continue to fall in cost, they are likely to ﬁnd applications where their use is driven by simplicity of access rather than any special virtue.  In summary, it seems likely that the most important RFID technology over the next decade will be the use of passive or semipassive silicon-IC-based tags in the UHF bands. In the remainder of this book, we will focus almost exclusively on passive UHF technology, but the reader should now be equipped to place this choice within the context of the speciﬁc set of requirements and circumstances current here in the early years of the twenty-ﬁrst century, rather than regarding it as eternal, foreordained, and unchangeable.  2.8 Further Reading  2.8.1 History  “Shrouds of Time: The History of RFID”, Jeremy Landt and Barbara Kaplin, AIM  Association for Automatic Identiﬁcation and Data Capture Technologies   “Communication by Means of Reﬂected Power”, Harry Stockman, Proc I.R.E., October, 1948, p. 1196  “Radio Transmission Systems with Modulatable Passive Responder”, Harris, US Patent 2 927 321, ﬁled 1952, granted 1960  “Folded Dipole Having a Direct Current Output”, Crump, US Patent 2,943,189, ﬁled 1956, granted 1960.  “The toll highway faces automation”, William Arnold, Electronics, November 8, 1973, p. 74  “Electronic Road Pricing in Singapore: A Technical Overview”, B.

Dark matter and dark energy don’t appear to interact with our alternately glowing and dusty stuff except through gravitational means. Folks made of dark matter  if such were to exist  couldn’t watch reruns of American Idol even if you forced them: they don’t have any means of interacting with the broadcast signal and probably don’t want to pay for cable.  For those condemned to the world of baryons and leptons, electromagnetic waves are a fact of life. In most textbooks on electromagnetic theory, you’ll wade through Maxwell’s equations and possibly laborious arguments on mysterious exchanges between the electric and magnetic ﬁelds launching self supporting structures with little Poynting vectors pointing out of them: all true but unnecessarily obscure. Before we go on to the mundane tasks of introducing the rele- vant terminology and technology of radio, let’s share a little secret, implicit but not readily apparent in the standard texts, which the author has found to considerably simplify his view of electromagnetic radiation. It goes like this:  Everything radiates, but most things cancel.  To expand a bit: every object in the world that has an electric charge creates an electrostatic potential, which falls inversely as the distance. The potential sensed at some distance r corre- sponds to what the charged object was doing at an earlier time  r c , because signals move at the speed of light c = 3× 108 m s. The total electric potential in the space between your nose and the pages of the book you’re reading depends on the amount of charge on the fur of a cat in Bulgaria  or Wisconsin, if you happen to be in Dobrich . However, we almost never care, because electric charge comes in two ﬂavors, positive and negative, and the amount of energy associated with an isolated charge of only one type is enormous: a microgram of hydrogen, split into its constituent protons and electrons and separated by 1 m, could support a mass of 8 million kilograms against the gravitational attraction of the entire earth. So in almost every case, adjacent to each electron with a negative charge is a proton with a positive charge, such that the two cancel, and have no net effect on your cellphone conversation. Electric currents  51   Chapter 3  similarly give rise to a magnetic vector potential in the direction of the current ﬂow, which again exists everywhere with amplitude decreasing with distance, at a correspondingly delayed time. Similar arguments show that most currents don’t have any effect on distant objects: if a current is ﬂowing in one direction, with no compensating countercurrent, charge must be accumulating somewhere, leading after a while to enormous energies  voltages . Most electric currents ﬂow in a balanced loop: the potential from current ﬂowing up cancels that from current ﬂowing down, and again no net effect results on distant observers. These points are made pictorially in Figure 3.1, where we also introduce a bit of the mathematical terminology associated with the subject.  At ﬁrst glance, we’re left with no potentials and no waves, but, of course, this is not correct. For example, we can run an uncompensated current for a little while before charge  Figure 3.1: Potentials from Charges and Currents Usually Cancel.  52   Radio Basics For UHF RFID  accumulation causes too much voltage to build up and then turn it around. This uncompensated current will lead to a detectable signal at a distance. In addition, cancellation will often fail to be exact when the charges and currents are changing in time because of the slight differences in delays due to the ﬁnite size of the region over which the currents ﬂow. For example, if in Figure 3.2, the loop current is suddenly turned on all around the loop at some time t = 0, the potential from the downward-ﬂowing current arrives at r just a bit sooner than that from the upward-ﬂowing current. Cancellation fails, and an observer sees some resulting potential: radiation has occurred.  Figure 3.2: Changing Currents on a Structure of Finite Size Disrupts Cancellation.  This leads to our second key observation:  An antenna is a device to produce currents and charges whose effects don’t cancel for a distant observer.  For an antenna to work, it should be apparent that something has to change: radiation is the result of the transient failure of delayed signals to cancel each other. In order to create a continuous signal, currents ﬂowing on an antenna must continuously change, without actually getting anywhere: that is, currents and charges are usually periodic functions of time, alterna- tely increasing and decreasing but returning to the same state again and again after the same interval. Periodic functions have a period—a time duration over which the signal is exactly repeated—and a frequency, conventionally measured in Hertz  Hz  and equal to  1 period . Thus, a signal that repeats itself every second has a frequency 1 Hz. The sine and cosine are archetypal periodic functions, widely used in science and electrical engineering; in electrical engineering these are often combined into a complex exponential function, which absorbs both frequency and delay  phase  into one expression: eix = cos x  +i sin x , where i is the  −1 .  The reader who wishes to follow the subsequent discussion in detail, imaginary unit but who is not familiar with these functions, may ﬁnd it useful to refer to Appendix 2 for a brief introduction to the terminology and characteristics of these harmonic functions.  √  53   Chapter 3  However, the main conclusions will be presented in pictorial form, and the reader new to the ﬁeld may ﬁnd it more convenient to absorb the images and defer their mathematical underpinning to a future date.   We should note that instead of arranging the currents on an antenna so as to frustrate cancellation at a distance, we can place the observer  the receiving antenna  so close to the transmitting antenna that cancellation is defeated simply because some currents on the trans- mitting antenna are close to the receiving antenna and have a larger effect than those more distant. This sort of interaction is known as near-ﬁeld coupling or alternatively as inductive coupling. We can think of inductive coupling as being fundamentally about differences in distance between differing parts of an antenna, whereas radiation is usually more closely related to differences in propagation time  phase  from one part of an antenna to another. The interested reader will ﬁnd an animated demonstration of these concepts on the CD that accompanies this volume.  The reader may wish to view  or revisit  the animation “Inductive and Radiative Coupling” on the CD.  Armed with an antenna carrying a periodic current, we can create electromagnetic waves, pro- pagating at the speed of light and falling in amplitude inversely with the distance  Figure 3.3 .  Figure 3.3: Radiated Waves Launched by a Transmitting Antenna Give Rise to a Voltage in a Receiving Antenna. See Appendix 2 for Deﬁnitions of the Harmonic Functions Used Here.  54   Radio Basics For UHF RFID  The waves induce a voltage in the receiving circuit, periodic with the same frequency as the transmitted signal, whose magnitude is inversely proportional to the distance between the transmitter and receiver. Using harmonic notation, the delay in time of Figure 3.1 becomes a phase offset by the wavenumber k multiplied by the distance r.  The absolute phase is often not readily observable or controllable in practical radio systems, so we can generally drop this term.  It is this voltage we make use of to transmit information—in the case of RFID, from a reader to a tag and back. How should we measure and describe it?  3.2 Describing Signal Voltage and Power  In most radio systems, we are interested in periodic currents and voltages since unchanging currents or voltages don’t radiate as discussed above. Thus, a time-dependent signal voltage is usually written as the product of a magnitude  here v0  and a periodic function like the sine or cosine:  with an analogous expression for periodic currents. The instantaneous power dissipated into a load is the product of the voltage across the load and the current ﬂowing through it. For a resistive load with a DC current ﬂowing, we ﬁnd:  P = I · V =  V = V 2 R  .  V  t  =v 0 cos ωt    cid:3   cid:2   cid:4   cid:5  cid:6   cid:7   V R  Ohm’s law  Pav = v2 0 2R  .  vrms = v0√ 2  → Pav = v2  .  rms R  To get the average power for a periodic signal, we add up the total power over a cycle and divide by the cycle time. This gives us a factor of  1 2 , the average value of cos2:  Sometimes people introduce the root-mean-square  RMS  voltage to eliminate the extra factor of  1 2  from the expression for power:  It isn’t always obvious which deﬁnition of voltage is being used; confusion on this score leads to erroneous factors of 2 ﬂoating around. In this book, we will always use peak voltages and currents rather than RMS quantities, and thus, explicitly include the factor of  1 2  in calcu- lating average power. It is often of interest to display the amount of power associated with a sinusoidal signal of a given frequency as a power spectrum; a simple example of such a dis- play for the single-frequency signal of equation  3.1  is shown in Figure 3.4.  55   3.1    3.2    3.3    3.4    Chapter 3  Figure 3.4: A Single-frequency Sinusoidal Signal and Corresponding Power Spectrum.  Signal power can vary over a huge range in typical radio practice: power dissipated into a −15  watt. typical 50-ohm load can range from tens of watts to 0.000 000 000 000 001  10 Related quantities, such as voltage, current, and gains and losses, span similar ranges. It is inconvenient to write out and manipulate such quantities as decimal numbers; instead, we use logarithmic notation. Recall that the base-10 logarithm is deﬁned as:  For example, log 10  =1, and log  1000  =3. Negative logarithms denote numbers less than 1: log 0.001  =− 3.  It is traditional to use not raw logarithms, but deciBels  dB  in communications engineering. The ratio of two powers—for example, the ratio of the output power from an ampliﬁer to the power that went in, which is the power gain of the ampliﬁer—can be written in dB as:   3.5    3.6   10 log x  = x.  GdB = 10 log  P2 P1  .  56   Radio Basics For UHF RFID  Now, recall that the power is proportional to the square of the voltage. If we wanted to express the powers in equation  3.6  in terms of the corresponding voltages, we would get:  GdB = 10 log  = 10 log  V 2 2 V 2 1   cid:4   = 20 log  V2 V1  .  log x2 =2 log x   cid:11   cid:7    cid:10 2  V2 V1   cid:8  cid:9   cid:5  cid:6   cid:2   cid:3   cid:4   cid:5  cid:6   cid:7   V2 V1 voltage ratio   cid:2   cid:3   cid:4   cid:5  cid:6   cid:7   P2 P1 power ratio   cid:2   cid:3   cid:4   cid:5  cid:6   cid:7   I2 I1 current ratio  .  That is: dB are deﬁned differently depending on the physical nature of the quantity being measured:  GdB = 10 log  = 20 log  = 20 log  To deﬁne absolute power in dB, we need to decide on a reference level. In microwave engi- neering, the most common reference level is 1 milliwatt  mW , and power measured in dB relative to 1 mW is referred to as dBm:   cid:2    cid:3   .  dBm = 10 log  P  1 mW  Some practical examples of logarithmic notation are shown in Table 3.1 and Table 3.2.  Because of the fact that log ab  = log a  + log b , dB add when the corresponding numbers multiply. A 1 microWatt signal that is passed through an ampliﬁer with a power gain of 1000 produces 1 mW of output; we can equivalently say “−30 dBm +30 dB = 0 dBm”.   3.7    3.8    3.9   Table 3.1: Power Gain in dB.  Gain  dB   0 10 20 30  Table 3.2: Power in dBm.

A factor of 10 in power is 10 dB, and a factor of 2 is very nearly 3 dB. Since logarithms add, a factor of 4 = 6 dB, and a factor of 8 = 9 dB. Knowing these points allows quick, reasonably accurate estimates: for example, 50 μW = 1 mW  10× 2  =0 dBm −10 dB −3 dB= −13 dBm.  3.3 Information, Modulation, and Multiplexing  A periodic signal that persists indeﬁnitely, without changing its amplitude, frequency, or phase—a continuous wave  CW  signal—carries no information other than the fact that it is present. In order to convey data, a signal needs to change. We normally think of this change as a relatively slowly changing variation—modulation—imposed on the periodic signal, for example:  V  t  =   cid:4  cid:5  cid:6  cid:7   m t    cid:4   cid:5  cid:6   cid:7  · cos ωct   carrier frequency  slowly varying  modulation  The function m t  is said to contain the baseband information, and the relatively high- frequency cosine function is the carrier. When the function m t  is another sine or cosine  presumably of much lower frequency , we can make use of trigonometric identities  see Appendix 2  to rewrite the signal in a revealing fashion:  V  t  = cos ωmt  slowly varying   cid:7    cid:4   cid:5  cid:6   cid:7   cid:5  cid:6   cid:4  · cos ωct  ⎧⎪⎨  cid:7   cid:4  ⎪⎩cos [ωc + ωm] t    cid:5  cid:6   modulation  {ωm  cid:4  ωc}  ⎫⎪⎬  cid:4   cid:7  ⎪⎭ + cos [ωc − ωm] t    cid:5  cid:6   carrier frequency  upper sideband  lower sideband  = 1 2   3.10    3.11   A sinusoidal modulation splits the carrier wave into two signals called sidebands, one above and one below the carrier, each displaced by the modulating frequency  Figure 3.5 . While a continuous sinusoidal modulation is hardly more interesting or useful than a CW signal, this result suggests that when a signal is modulated, the resulting frequency spectrum becomes wider.  Signals of interest for RFID are generally digitally modulated. A digitally modulated signal is a stream of distinct symbols. A simple example with substantial relevance for RFID is on–off keying  OOK . The signal power is kept large  m = 1  to indicate a binary ‘1’ and small or zero  m = 0  to represent a binary ‘0’. An example is shown in Figure 3.6. In OOK, each  58   Radio Basics For UHF RFID  Figure 3.5: Sinusoidally Modulated Carrier Wave and Corresponding Frequency Spectrum; fc is the Carrier Frequency.  symbol is a period of ﬁxed duration in which the signal power is either high or low. Each OOK symbol represents one binary bit, though other types of symbols can convey more than one bit each. Any circuit that can change the output power, such as a simple switch, can be used to create an OOK signal, and any circuit that can detect power levels can demodulate  extract the data from  the signal. For example, a diode—an electrical component that passes electrical current only in one direction and blocks current ﬂow in the opposite direction—can rectify a high-frequency signal, turning it into pulses of DC. These pulses can be smoothed with a storage capacitor to produce an output signal that looks very much like the baseband signal m t   see Figure 2.17 in Chapter 2 . If the diode responds rapidly, it can be used at very high frequencies. Modern diodes can operate up to over 1 GHz, allowing passive RFID tags to demodulate a reader signal using only a diode and capacitor.  Unmodiﬁed OOK is admirably simple and seems promising as a method of modulating a reader signal. However, there is a problem with OOK for passive RFID. As we noted in Chapter 2, a passive RFID tag depends on power obtained from the reader to run its circuitry.  59   Chapter 3  Figure 3.6: On–Off-Keyed Signal.  If that power is interrupted, the tag cannot operate. However, imagine the case of an OOK signal containing a long string of binary 0s: in this case, m = 0 for as long as the data remains 0. The tag will receive no power during this time. If the data remains ‘0’ for too long, the tag will power off and need to be restarted, a situation not likely to be conducive to reliable operation. Even when some binary 1s are present, the power level delivered to the tag is strongly data dependent, an undesirable trait.  A common solution to the power problem is to code the binary data prior to modulation. One RFID coding approach is known as pulse-interval encoding  PIE . A binary ‘1’ is coded as a short power-off pulse following a long full-power interval, and a binary ‘0’ is coded as a shorter full-power interval with the same power-off pulse  Figure 3.7 . The resulting coded baseband signal m t  is then used to modulate the carrier  Figure 3.8 . PIE using equal low and high pulses for a ‘0’ ensures that at least 50% of the maximum power is delivered to the tag even when the data being transmitted contains long strings of zeros, and if the high is three times as long for a ‘1’, a random stream of equally mixed binary data will provide about 63% of peak power. Note that in this case, the data rate becomes dependent on the data: a stream of binary 0s will be transmitted more rapidly than a stream of binary 1s. A single symbol has two features—the off-time and on-time—but still conveys only one binary bit.  This scheme is used in EPCglobal Class 1 Generation 2 readers. Other passive RFID standards use slightly different coding schemes, all generally characterized by the desire to have the reader power on as much as possible to power the tag.   60   Radio Basics For UHF RFID  Figure 3.7: Pulse-interval Coding Baseband Symbols  the function m t  .  Figure 3.8: Pulse-interval Coding with OOK Modulation of a Carrier Wave.  In ﬁxing the problem with transmitted power by replacing OOK with PIE, we’ve made another problem worse. Radio waves travel everywhere, so in some sense the radio medium is shared between various users. For example, I would like to be able to read tags on packages in my storeroom despite the fact that the storeroom is also illuminated by the local broadcast radio and television stations, cellular phone basestations, the radio link from the taxi across the street, and the satellite downlink to the neighborhood cable TV system. Using a single medium for many signals is known as multiplexing. The most common form of multiplexing in radio, in use for almost a century, is frequency-division multiple access  FDMA : different users  61   Chapter 3  transmit using different carrier frequencies, and receivers are adapted to capture only the frequency of interest.  Signals can also be multiplexed in time and in coding. In RFID, time multiplexing is used when a reader uses an anticollision algorithm to poll tags one at a time; see Chapter 8 for more details.  We will discuss the means used to ﬁlter the desired frequen- cies from the received signal in more detail in Chapter 4; for the present, it sufﬁces to know that this operation can be accomplished. An RFID reader transmits on a frequency within the band at 902–928 MHz  in the United States , and listens to responses only within that band, rejecting the AM radio broadcast at 1 MHz, the television transmission at 52 MHz, the cellular transmission at 874 MHz, and so on.  This scheme would seem to allow an unlimited number of users to share the electromagnetic spectrum. However, recall that a signal must be modulated in order to convey information. When we modulate the signal, we increase the signal bandwidth. We saw an indication that this would be so in examining analog sinusoidal modulation of a signal  Figure 3.5 . A mod- ulated signal occupies a ﬁnite region of frequency, and neighbors must be separated by something like that amount in frequency to avoid interference.  Furthermore, choices we make in modulation affect how much bandwidth we use. For exam- ple, if we modulate the signal faster by making the individual symbols take less time—that is, if we increase the data rate—we use more bandwidth. This phenomenon is illustrated in Figure 3.91, where we show the power spectrum of a modulated signal, and we have made use of the dB notation for spectral power introduced in Section 3.2 above. The spectrum has its largest power near the carrier frequency fc, but a considerable amount of power is transmitted at frequencies rather far from the carrier, as we might have suspected from Figure 3.5 above. The distance from the carrier frequency to the ﬁrst major ‘dip’ in the spectrum is inversely proportional to the symbol time τ—that is, it is the same as the data rate R = 1 τ for OOK. The shorter the symbol time, the faster we can send data, but the more bandwidth we use.  How we send symbols also matters. An abrupt step at the edge of each symbol gives more power far from the carrier than a smooth transition between low and high power states, as depicted in Figure 3.10.  Note that the residual power shown far from the carrier for the smooth symbols in this ﬁgure is affected by the speciﬁc method of smoothing the symbol and the accuracy of the numerical model.  Of course, the ability to smooth the transitions is limited by the duration of the symbols: at some point, changes happen so slowly that fully on or fully off states are never reached, causing the transmitted power to fall  and become data  1 It is worth noting that in this and the next few ﬁgures, the spectra are calculated for a series of about 80 random data bits, only a few of which are shown in the upper “signal” display, in order to keep the diagrams intelligible. If we calculated the frequency spectra over a larger number of bits, they would be smoother, but the spectra shown are reasonably representative of the kind of data actually obtained when the output of a typical frequency-hopping RFID reader is examined over short time scales.  62   Radio Basics For UHF RFID  Figure 3.9: Faster Modulation = Wider Spectrum.  dependent . Smoothing the signals also makes the receiver’s problem harder. It doesn’t really matter when you test the voltage of a signal like that in left side of Figure 3.10 as long as you are within the symbol, but the smoothed signal on the right side is best sampled exactly at the center of the symbol, where the power is either at its maximum value or nearly zero. Sampling at any other times will result in more power for a nominal ‘0’ or less power for a nominal ‘1’: that is, the measured modulation depth is reduced. Thus, the receiver needs to do a better job of synchronizing with the incoming signal if that signal is smoothed.  Finally, the way we code the signal also matters. By examination of Figure 3.6 and Figure 3.8, we can see that pulse interval encoding will result in shorter pulses than OOK for the same data rate, so from Figure 3.9, it seems likely that PIE would have a wider spectrum than OOK for the same data rate. This expectation is conﬁrmed in Figure 3.11: substituting a stream of PIE symbols at the same average data rate for OOK symbols results in reduced power very near the carrier, but more power far from the carrier. In particular, a strong, narrow emission is seen at a frequency which turns out to correspond to  1 duration of a binary ‘0’ ; as depicted by the inset in the ﬁgure, the strong resemblance of a ‘0’ symbol to a sine function results in a concentration of power at the corresponding frequency. The more diffuse band at half this offset results from the binary ‘1’ symbol.  63   Chapter 3  Figure 3.10: Abrupt Symbols Have More Power at Frequencies Far from the Carrier.  The Exact Levels Shown Here are Somewhat Dependent on the Modeling Algorithm.   To clarify why this sort of thing matters in real applications, let’s look at a practical example. In the United States, unlicensed readers randomly hop from one frequency to another within the ISM band from 902–928 MHz. Typically, RFID readers use channels that are 500 kHz wide and separated by 500 kHz. When a reader is trying to hear a tag, it transmits a signal of constant amplitude and phase. If reader 1on channel 10 is trying to hear a tag, while reader 2 on channel 11 is producing an emission spectra like those shown in Figure 3.11, the situation would look something like Figure 3.12, where the spectrum from reader 2 is scaled for a data rate of about 100 kbps and a distance of about 20 m. In Section 3.5 below, we will ﬁnd that for typical distances, a tag signal is likely to be 40–90 dB smaller than the CW signal from the reader. The leakage from reader 2 into reader 1s channel is thus comparable to or even larger than the tag signal; it will be difﬁcult to detect the tag when reader 2 is trans- mitting data. Note, this is happening despite the fact that the tags are only 1–3 m from the reader, much closer than the interfering reader!  Even worse, if one of the readers happened to be near the edge of the ISM band, some of this power may be radiated outside of the allowed frequency range, potentially interfering with  64   Radio Basics For UHF RFID  Figure 3.11: Coding Data as PIE Produces a Strong Narrow Emission Far from the Carrier, as Well as a Higher Average Signal Power Far from the Carrier; the Inset Shows How This Band Arises from the ‘0’ Symbol.  The Exact Position of These Features Relative to the Data Rate Varies Depending on the Duration of a Binary ‘1’.   users of licensed frequencies, who have often paid for the privilege of exclusive use of said spectrum and get upset when they encounter freeloaders. In the United States, the FCC requires that all radios be tested to ensure that such out-of-band radiation is minimized. Interference and out-of-band emissions represent important limits on how fast data can be transmitted by a reader, and on coding and modulation used, because the speed and method of modulation determine the bandwidth of the resulting signal.  Let us pause for a bit of mathematics to clarify the frequency scales of the ﬁgures above. An ideal abrupt pulse  an OOK binary ‘1’  of duration τ has a spectrum:  ˜f  ω  =  sin ωτ 2   .  ω  2 π   3.12    cid:19   65   Chapter 3  k  kbps,  Figure 3.12: Power Far from the Carrier of Reader 2 is in the Channel of Reader 1 if Data Rate is High and Unsmoothed PIE is Used.  This function has some useful special values:   cid:19    cid:20    cid:21   ˜f  0  =  2 π  τ 2  ;  ˜f  ωn  =0 for ωn = 2nπ τ  fn = n τ  , n  cid:5 = 0.   3.13   In particular, the ﬁrst zero of this function is at a frequency of  1 τ , where τ is the duration of the pulse. When the signal is a modulated carrier wave, the spectrum is centered around the carrier frequency, and the zeros are displaced from the carrier by  1 τ   Figure 3.13 .  A stream of binary pulses—an OOK signal as in Figure 3.6—is just the sum of a number of these pulses, each with the same spectrum, so the full data stream will also have a spectrum with zero value at the same frequency offset from the carrier. These ﬁrst zeros determine the width of the main lobe of the signal spectrum and are indicated by the dashed lines in Figure 3.9. Most of the power in the spectrum is contained within the region about half this wide, that is within a frequency range of channel that makes sense for an OOK signal is about twice as wide as the inverse of the data rate; we need 200 kHz to ﬁt in 100 kbps.  fc − 1   fc + 1    cid:23  cid:23    cid:23  cid:23   .

PIE is much less efﬁcient because the shortest pulse—the high part of a binary ‘0’, Figure 3.8—is about 1 3 as long as an OOK pulse for the same data rate, so roughly three times as much spectrum is needed. To ﬁt the main lobe of the spectrum within a 500 kHz channel, we can only use a data rate of around 85 kbps—which, as we will see in Chapter 8, is just about the upper limit on reader data rates in United States operation, using unﬁltered PIE-like modulations.  To summarize:  To convey information on a signal, the signal must be modulated.      Modulation causes the signal’s spectrum to expand, requiring allocation of bandwidth  in order to avoid interference.  67   Chapter 3     The peculiar requirements of passive RFID lead to modulation and coding of binary data that are relatively inefﬁcient in spectral use, limiting reader data rates.  It is important to note that more sophisticated radio systems, such as cellular telephony or IEEE 802.11  WiFi , use modulation techniques that are substantially more efﬁcient users of spectrum than PIE or OOK. However, these methods generally depend on the ability of the receiver to detect changes in the phase of the high-frequency signal rather than simply deter- mining the power level, which passive RFID tags generally cannot do. As we will discuss in more detail in Chapters 4 and 8, single sideband  SSB  and phase-reversal ASK  PR-ASK  modulations, which use phase information at the reader but require only amplitude detection from the tag, can be used to improve the spectral efﬁciency.  3.4 Backscatter Radio Links  Passive and semipassive RFID tags do not use a radio transmitter; instead, they use modulation of the reﬂected power from the tag antenna. Reﬂection of radio waves from an object has been a subject of active study since the development of radar began in the 1930s, and the use of backscattered radio for communications since Harry Stockman’s work  see Chapter 2  in 1949.  A very simple way to understand backscatter modulation is shown schematically in Figure 3.14: current ﬂowing on a transmitting antenna leads to a voltage induced on a receiv- ing antenna. If the antenna is connected to a load, which presents little impediment to current ﬂow, it seems reasonable that a current will be induced on the receiving antenna. In the ﬁgure, the smallest possible load, a short circuit, is illustrated. This induced current is no different from the current on the transmitting antenna that started things out in the ﬁrst place: it leads to radiation.  A principle of electromagnetic theory almost always valid in the ordinary world, the principle of reciprocity, says that any structure that receives a wave can also transmit a wave. We shall make use of this principle in discussing antennas in greater detail shortly.  The radiated wave can make its way back to the transmitting antenna, induce a voltage, and there- fore, produce a signal that can be detected: a backscattered signal. On the other hand, if instead a load that permits little current to ﬂow—that is, a load with a large impedance—is placed between the antenna and ground, it seems reasonable that little or no induced current will result. In Figure 3.14, we show the largest possible load, an open circuit  no connection at all . Since it is currents on the antenna that lead to radiation, there will be no backscattered signal in this case. Therefore, the signal on the transmitting antenna is sensitive to the load connected to the receiving antenna.  To construct a practical communications link using this scheme, we can attach a transistor as the antenna load  Figure 3.15 . When the transistor gate contact is held at the appropriate  68   Radio Basics For UHF RFID  Figure 3.14: Simpliﬁed Physics of Backscatter Signaling.  potential to turn the transistor on, current travels readily through the channel, similar to a short circuit. When the gate is turned off, the channel becomes substantially nonconductive. Since the current induced on the antenna, and thus, the backscattered wave received at the reader, depend on the load presented to the antenna, this scheme creates a modulated backscattered wave at the reader. Note that the modulating signal presented to the transistor is a baseband signal at a low frequency of a few hundred kHz at most, even though the reﬂected signal to the reader may be at 915 MHz. The use of the backscatter link means that the modulation switching circuitry in the tag only needs to operate at modest frequencies comparable to the data, not the carrier frequency, resulting in savings of cost and power.  Real RFID tag ICs are not quite this simple and may use a small change in capacitance to modulate the antenna current instead, for reasons we will discuss in Chapter 5.   69   Chapter 3  Figure 3.15: Modulated Backscatter Using a Transistor as a Switch.  Note that in order to implement a backscattered scheme, the reader must transmit a signal. In many radio systems, the transmitter turns off when the receiver is trying to acquire a signal; this scheme is known as half-duplex to distinguish it from the case where the transmitter and receiver may operate simultaneously  known as a full-duplex radio . In a passive RFID system, the transmitter does not turn itself off but instead, transmits CW during the time the receiver is listening for the tag signal. RFID radios use specialized components known as circulators or couplers to allow only reﬂected signals to get to the receiver, which might otherwise be saturated by the huge transmitted signal. However, in a single-antenna system, the transmitted signal from the reader bounces off its own antenna back into the receiver, and the transmitted wave from the antenna bounces off any nearby objects such as desks, tables, people, coffee cups, metal boxes, and all the other junk that real environments are ﬁlled with, in addition to the poor little tag antenna we’re trying to see  Figure 3.16 . If two antennas are used  one for transmit and one for receive , there is still typically some signal power that leaks directly from one to the other, as well as the aforesaid spurious reﬂections from objects in the neighborhood.  The total signal at the receiver is the vector sum of all these contributions, most of which are much larger than the wanted tag signal, with appropriate amplitudes and phases, most of which are unpredictable a priori. Thus, the actual effect of a given change in the load on the tag antenna on the receiver signal is completely unpredictable and uncontrollable. For exam- ple, modulating the size of the tag antenna current  amplitude modulation  may not result in the same kind of change in the reader signal. In Figure 3.17, we show a case where changing the tag reﬂection from a large amplitude  HI  to a small amplitude  LO  causes the received signal to increase in magnitude without changing phase  the “AM” case . Changing the phase of the tag signal without changing the size of the reﬂected signal in order to symbolize a LO  70   Radio Basics For UHF RFID  Figure 3.16: Realistic Environments Create Many Reﬂected Waves in Addition to that from the Wanted Tag.  Figure 3.17: The Received Signal is not Simply Correlated to the Tag Signal. The AM Case Assumes the Tag Reduces its Scattered Magnitude Without Changing Phase; the PSK Case Assumes Phase Inversion Without Amplitude Change.  state may change the amplitude of the reader signal at constant phase  Figure 3.17, “PSK” case . The only thing we can say with any conﬁdence is that when we make a change in the state of the tag antenna, something about the phase or amplitude of the reader signal will change. In order to make a backscatter link work, we need to choose a way to code the data that can be interpreted based only on these changes and not on their direction or on whether they are changes in phase or amplitude.  As a consequence, all approaches to coding the tag signal are based on counting the number of changes in tag state in a given time interval, or equivalently on changing the frequency of the  71   Chapter 3  tag’s state changes. Therefore, all tag codes are variations of frequency-shift keying  FSK . It is important to note that the frequency being referred to here is not the radio carrier frequency of  say  900 MHz but the tag  baseband  frequency of perhaps 100 or 200 kHz. A binary ‘1’ might be coded by having the tag ﬂip its state 100 times per millisecond, and a binary ‘0’ might have 50 ﬂips per millisecond. Because the frequency being changed is the frequency at which a carrier is being amplitude modulated, techniques like this are sometimes known as subcarrier modulation.  Let’s look at one speciﬁc example of tag coding, usually known as FM0  Figure 3.18 . In FM0, the tag state changes at the beginning and end of every symbol. In addition, a binary 0 has an additional state change in the middle of the symbol. Note that, unlike OOK, the actual tag state does not reliably correspond to the binary bit: for example, in the left-hand side of the ﬁgure, two of the binary ‘1’ symbols have the tag in the LO state and another ‘1’ symbol has the tag in the HI state. Remember, the reader can’t reliably distinguish which state is which but can only count transitions between them. The right side of the ﬁgure shows the baseband signal corresponding to a series of identical binary bits to clarify the correspondence of binary ‘0’s with a frequency twice as high as that of binary ‘1’s.  Different tag coding schemes can be used to adjust the offset from the carrier frequency at which the signal from the tags is found. As we will ﬁnd in Chapter 4, readers have an easier time seeing a tag signal when it is well separated from their own carrier frequency, so higher subcarrier frequencies help improve the ability to read a tag signal. However, if the separation is large compared to the channel size, the tag signal might lie on the signal of another reader in a different channel. Just as with readers, increasing the data rate of a tag signal tends to spread the spectrum out in frequency. To have a ﬂexible choice of tag data rates while minimizing noise, the reader needs to be able to adapt the band of frequencies it tries to receive, adding cost and complexity.  μ  Figure 3.18: FM0 Encoding of Tag Data.  72   Radio Basics For UHF RFID  In real receivers, noise and interference may be present as well as the desired signal. A certain minimum signal-to-noise ratio  S N  is necessary for each type of modulation in order that it can be reliably decoded by the receiver. The exact  S N  threshold depends on how accurate you’re trying to be and to a lesser extent on the algorithms used for demodulation decoding. For RFID using FM0,  S N  of around 10 or better  10 dB or more  is usually sufﬁcient.  Requirements for demodulation of reader symbols, like PIE, in the tag are generally similar.  As we will see in Chapter 8, modern protocols provide alternative modulations that can operate with smaller  S N  ratios, at the cost of a reduction in the tag data rate.  3.5 Link Budgets  Let’s summarize the message of the last couple of sections. To transmit to a tag, a reader uses amplitude modulation to send a series of digital symbols. The symbols are coded to ensure that sufﬁcient power is always being transmitted regardless of the data contained within in. The received signal can be demodulated using a very simple power detection scheme to produce a baseband voltage, which is then decoded by the tag logic. The whole scheme is depicted in Figure 3.19.  μ  Figure 3.19: Schematic Depiction of Reader-to-tag Data Link.  73   Chapter 3  Figure 3.20 shows the corresponding tag-to-reader arrangements. The tag codes the data it wishes to send and then induces changes in the impedance state of the antenna. The reader CW signal bounces off the tag antenna  competing with other reﬂections  and is demodulated by the reader receiver and then decoded back into the transmitted data.  Figure 3.20: Schematic Depiction of Tag-to-reader Data Link  A Separate Receive Antenna is Shown for Clarity .  While we have alluded several times to the fact that the reader must power the tag, so far we have avoided coming to grips with the crucial associated question of just how much power the tag needs to get and just how far we can go from the reader and still get it. The amount of power that one needs to deliver to a receiver across a wireless link in order that the transmitted data be successfully received is known as the link budget. Since readers and tags both talk, for an RFID system there are two separate link budgets, one associated with the reader-to-tag communication  the forward link budget  and one with the tag reply to the reader  the reverse link budget 2.  2 EPC global discourages the use of the terms forward and reverse link for readers and tags, but these terms are widely used in other areas of wireless networking, where an asymmetric link is under consideration, and seem perfectly applicable to RFID.  74   Radio Basics For UHF RFID  In order to ﬁnd the forward link budget, we need to know the following:    How much power can the reader transmit?   How much power does the tag receive as a function of distance from the reader?   How much power does the tag need to turn on?   How much power does the tag need to decode the reader signal?  Let’s examine each question in turn.  3.5.1 Reader Transmit Power  The reader transmit power is set by a combination of practicality and regulation. Most RFID equipment operates in spectrum set aside for unlicensed use by the governmental body that regulates radio operation in a given jurisdiction. For example, in the United States, the FCC allows operation in the band 902–928 MHz without requiring that the person operating the equipment have a license to do so. However, the equipment itself must obey certain operating limitations in order to allow unlicensed use. Relevant for us at the moment is the maximum transmit power, which cannot exceed 1 W. While not all readers will deliver a watt, and in some applications, we may intentionally reduce transmitted power, in many cases a UHF reader will be operated at the legal limit. So let’s assume we transmit 1 W oftotal power.  3.5.2 Path Loss  The difference between the power delivered to the transmitting antenna and that obtained from the receiving antenna is known as the path loss. In general, ﬁnding the path loss requires knowing something about the details of the antenna operation, and we shall discuss the rele- vant measurements and terminology shortly. However, to get started, we will use the simplest possible  not very accurate  approach: let us assume that the transmitting antenna radiates in all directions with the same power density, that is the transmitter is isotropic. We can picture the radiated power as being uniformly distributed over a spherical surface at any given dis- tance r from the reader antenna  Figure 3.21 . Some of this power can be collected by a tag antenna. It is reasonable to guess that the amount of power collected should be proportional to the density of power impinging on the tag and dimensionally necessary that the constant of proportionality be an area, often known as the effective aperture Ae of the tag antenna.  Since in the isotropic case the power density at a distance r is the ratio of the transmitted power PTX to the sphere area, we can ﬁnd the power received by the tag PRX:  PRX = PTX  Ae 4πr2  .  75   3.14    Chapter 3  Figure 3.21: An Isotropic Antenna Radiates Power Uniformly Over the Surface of a Sphere.  In order to get numbers out, we need a value for the effective aperture. It is not trivial to derive what this area should be, but it is plausible  and correct  to guess that the effective aperture of an antenna around a half-wavelength long might correspond to a square around a half- wavelength on a side.  The interested reader is referred to Balanis or Kraus and Marhevka in Further Reading, Section 3.9 of this chapter, for more information on how these areas are obtained.  The actual answer for an isotropic antenna  which a tag isn’t quite  is  Ae = λ2 4π  ≈ 86 cm2@ 915 MHz.   3.15   With a value for the aperture, we can now obtain an estimate of the path loss for our proposed isotropic link. At a distance of 1 m, the spherical surface has an area of 12.6 m2, so for 1 watt −4 = 0.7 mW  −1.6 dBm . Since of transmit power, we get about 1 86   126,000  = 7 × 10 we started with a watt or 30 dBm, the path loss is about 32 dB.  Since the area scales with the square of the radius, we can very easily scale path loss, espe- cially in dB: a factor of 10 in distance adds 20 dB to the path loss  20 dB decade . A factor of 3 is worth just a bit less than half of this  about 9.5 dB . So at 3 m, the path loss is about  32 + 9.5  ≈ 41 dB, and at 10 m it is about 52 dB.  76   Radio Basics For UHF RFID  3.5.3 Tag Power Requirement  The tag antenna needs to deliver enough power to turn the tag IC on. We will consider this problem in some detail in Chapter 5; for the present, it sufﬁces to give the results. Modern tag ICs actually consume around 10–30 μW to operate when being read  much more power is required to write new data to the tag memory . This power must be supplied by a rectifying circuit, which is about 30% efﬁcient, due primarily to the substantial turn-on voltage required to make current ﬂow through the diodes  see Chapter 5 . As a consequence, tags require about 30–100 μW of power to be delivered from the antenna to provide the required 10–30 μW of power to the chip. For simplicity, let us for the moment use a rather conservative 100 μW  −10 dBm  as the required threshold power. If we started at the transmitter with 1 watt  30 dBm , and we need to end up with −10 dBm, we have room for a path loss of  30−  −10   = 40 dB. By reference to the previous paragraph, this corresponds to a distance of just less than 3 m. Thus, we expect the forward-link-limited range of a 1-watt reader connected to an isotropic antenna to be no more than about 3 m, for a tag that requires 100 μW to power up. Most RFID readers use modulation depths  the extent to which the power is reduced in the low-power state of e.g., Figure 3.6 or Figure 3.8  of nearly 100%, so it is reasonable to guess that any time the tag has enough power to turn the IC on, it also receives more than enough signal power to interpret the data being sent by the reader. The calculation is depicted graphically in Figure 3.22. We construct a line of slope −20 dB decade  −6 dB octave  and adjust the height of the line to give −1.5 dBm at 1 m. We can then immediately obtain the range as the intersection of this line with the required power for the IC, here taken as −10 dBm.  To perform the analogous calculation for the reverse link, we need to give thought to two additional issues:    How much power does the tag send?   How much power must the reader receive to demodulate and decode the tag data?  As we noted in Section 3.4, a passive tag does not generate its own carrier but simply modiﬁes the amount of the incident radiation it backscatters. It is in principle possible for the tag to backscatter up to four times as much power as it could absorb—but if it does so, the IC will receive no power at all. It is in principle possible to simultaneously deliver slightly less than the maximum absorbed power  e.g. −10 dBm in Figure 3.22  to the IC and scatter about the same amount of power back to the reader. In practice, this is challenging to accomplish. Actual modulation efﬁciency varies from one design to another; a reasonable estimate for our purposes is to assume a modulated backscatter power around 1 3 of the absorbed power  that’s −5 dB .  77   Chapter 3  Figure 3.22: Forward Link Budget Calculation For Passive Tag, United States Operation.  Note, Simple Scaling is Not Valid When the Tag is Within a Wavelength of the Antenna, Here Shown as a Dotted Line.   The amount of power the reader needs to receive is also complex and depends on a number of details of implementation we shall consider somewhat more thoroughly in Chapter 4. For the present purposes, we shall suggest a plausible and convenient lower limit of around −75 dBm  0.03 nW , deferring justiﬁcation of this value until later. With the reader’s indulgence, we shall proceed to use these unjustiﬁed assumptions to construct a diagram of the reverse link power in the same fashion as that previously constructed for the forward link; the result is depicted in Figure 3.23. We construct a second line like the ﬁrst but starting at 5 dB less than the tag received power. Note that in this case, as the line descends, we are physically moving back towards the reader. If we move back 3 m  to intercept the dotted vertical line labeled ‘forward-link-limited range’ , we ﬁnd the reader receives about −55 dBm, about 20 dB in excess of the power required by the reader’s receiver. In fact, a receiver could be an  78   Radio Basics For UHF RFID  Figure 3.23: Forward- and Reverse Link Budget Calculation for Passive Tag, United States Operation.  additional 29 m away before the signal would fall so low as to fail to be received for this threshold value.  While the details of our simpliﬁed calculations are hardly authoritative, the observation that passive tags are forward-link-limited has historically been generally correct. The reason is that tag IC power requirements of tens or hundred of microwatts are actually monstrously large compared to the tiny signal powers that can be detected by a good-quality radio receiver. However, as the required power delivered to the IC is decreased with continued progress in IC technology, this may change.  To understand why, we need to understand how the power returned to the reader scales with tag-reader distance. Note in Figure 3.23 that the starting power for the tag scales with the  79   Chapter 3  received power. If we double the distance to the tag, the power the tag receives falls by a factor of 4, and thus, the transmit power associated with the tag  the reverse link power  also falls by a factor of 4. But this power has to travel twice as far to get back to the reader, so the received power at the reader falls by an additional factor of 4. The net result for a doubling of the distance is a 16-fold  24  decrease in the received power at the reader. The received power from a backscatter link falls as the inverse fourth power of the distance:  PRX,back :  1 r4  .   3.16   In the case of a power-hungry passive tag, this scaling is rendered moot by the need to provide a ﬁxed forward power to the tag. However, when the tag power is reduced by  say  10 times, the forward-link-limited range increases by a factor of about 3. The received signal thus dec- reases by 20 dB, placing it at the threshold for this example receiver: the tag becomes reverse-link-limited  at least for this receiver . As we will see in Chapter 5, reader sensitivity is dependent on several design choices, particularly, antenna conﬁguration, and will become more important as tag IC power is scaled to lower values. For a semipassive tag, the forward-link requirement is much more lenient since the received power must only be decoded not exploited, and inverse-fourth-power scaling is very important in determining the range of the tag.  3.6 Effect of Antenna Gain and Polarization on Range  We have been able to conclude that using an isotropic antenna, an RFID reader might achieve a read range of a few meters with 1 watt of output power. This conﬁguration might be ﬁne if RFID tags of interest are equally likely to be located in any direction with respect to the reader. However, such a circumstance is itself rather improbable. In the vast majority of cases, the reader antenna is placed at the edge of some region of interest, and the tags are to be located more or less centrally within this region, at some fairly well-deﬁned angular relationship with the reader antenna. The power that is then being radiated in other directions is wasted  or worse, is reading tags outside the region of interest and confusing rather than enlightening the user . We could make better use of the transmitted power if we could cause the antenna to radiate preferentially along the directions in which tags are most likely to be found.  Fortunately, this is entirely possible to achieve. An antenna that performs this trick is known as a directional antenna. The operation of such an antenna is often depicted by showing an antenna radiation pattern; an example of such a pattern is depicted in Figure 3.24. For any direction d relative to the center of the antenna, the distance to the pattern surface represents the relative power density radiated by the antenna in that direction. The radiation pattern is an intuitively appealing method to represent the way a directional antenna concentrates its radiated power in a beam propagating in a particular direction.  80   Radio Basics For UHF RFID  Figure 3.24: Pseudo-3D Radiation Pattern for Directional Antenna.  The ratio of the radiation intensity in any direction d to the intensity averaged over all directions is the directive gain of the antenna in that direction. The directive gain along the direction in which that quantity is maximized is known as the directivity of the antenna, and the directivity multiplied by the radiation efﬁciency is the power gain of the antenna  very often just referred to as the gain, G . In the direction of maximum radiated power density, we get G times more power than we would have obtained from an isotropic antenna of the type discussed in connection with Figures 3.21–3.23.  A note of caution is appropriate in considering the terminology we have just introduced. Antennas are passive devices and have no gain, in the sense that they can only radiate the power that is put into them, no more. The term antenna gain refers to the fact that, for a receiving antenna fortunate enough to be located along the direction of maximum power density, the received power is increased relative to that of an isotropic antenna just as if the output power of the directive antenna had been increased  isotropically  by a factor of G. Of course, this has not actually happened; the radiated power has just been rearranged, and receiving antennas located in less fortunate directions receive much less power than would have been the case with an isotropic radiator.  The higher the gain of a directional antenna the more narrowly focused is the energy radiated from it. We can express the relationship mathematically by making the approximation that all the energy radiated by the antenna is uniformly distributed across a beam with some solid  81   Chapter 3  angle Ωbeam, and no energy is radiated elsewhere. In this case, the directivity of the antenna must be equal to the ratio of the beam solid angle to the total area of the unit sphere  4π , so we ﬁnd that the solid angle is inversely proportional to the directivity  Figure 3.25 . If the antenna radiates most of the energy it receives  which is usually the case for antennas with high directivity , the gain and directivity are about the same, so the size of the beam is inversely proportional to the gain. The beam angle is roughly the square root of the beam solid angle when the beam is reasonably symmetric.  Figure 3.25: Beam Approximation for the Radiation Pattern of a Directional Antenna.  Pseudo-3D depictions of the radiation pattern are helpful to visualize complex geometries, but are difﬁcult to obtain quantitative information from when printed. It is traditional to extract slices of the true radiation pattern in planes that pass through symmetry axes of the antenna. These may be labeled as altitude and azimuth, or sometimes E-plane and H-plane patterns  the notation refers to the planes in which the electric and magnetic ﬁelds are located and needn’t concern us here . An example of such a pattern diagram for a real commercial directional antenna usable for RFID readers is shown in Figure 3.26. This particular antenna used is known as a panel or patch antenna because it is constructed of a metal patch suspended over a metal ground plane, though the user cannot see these details unless they have the courage to slice up the nice-looking plastic casing. This particular pattern is plotted on a logarithmic radial scale, but linear scales are also used. By simply ﬁnding the locations at which the gain is reduced by 3 dB from the maximum value in the center of the beam, we can extract the 3 dB beamwidth, as has been done in this ﬁgure. Since 72  ◦ ≈ 1.25 radians, we can estimate the  82   Radio Basics For UHF RFID  beam solid angle to be about  1.25 2 = 1.6 steradians, so the antenna gain must be roughly G ≈ 4π 1.6 ≈ 8, or 9 dB.  The actual gain of this antenna as reported on the data sheet is about 8.5 dB, so our simple calculation has produced a quite acceptably accurate result. However, the gain is also inﬂuenced by the power in the sidelobes and deviations of a couple of dB from this simple formula are not uncommon.  Practical, usable commercial antennas can provide us with quite substantial gains relative to an isotropic antenna.  Figure 3.26: Example Azimuth Pattern for a Commercial Directional Panel Antenna  Maxrad MP9026CPR .  Not all antennas are highly directional. Though it turns out to be impossible to fabricate a truly isotropic antenna, one can come fairly close to this ideal. A very common example of a not-very-directional antenna is the dipole antenna  Figure 3.27 . A dipole is constructed of two pieces of collinear wire driven by opposed voltages. Many RFID tag antennas are variants of a simple dipole. Dipole antennas do not radiate along their axes but radiate equally well in every direction perpendicular to the axis. Thus, the radiation pattern looks rather like a donut  or a bagel, depending on your nutritional inclinations . The gain of a typical dipole roughly half a wavelength long—16 cm at 900 MHz—is about 2.2 dB.  83   Chapter 3  Figure 3.27: Dipole Antenna with Views of the Corresponding Radiation Pattern.  The gains we have been quoting so far are all measured with respect to an ideal  nonexistent  isotropic antenna and are often written as dBi to denote that reference state. In practice, gain is measured by comparing the received power of an antenna under test to a reference antenna, the latter often being a standard dipole antenna. Thus, it is easy to measure and report the gain of an antenna relative to a dipole, and this is sometimes done; such gains are usually written as dBd. Since a dipole has 2.2 dBi of gain, gain referenced to a dipole is 2.2 dB less than gain referenced to an isotropic antenna: dBd = dBi −2.2.  Given the gain and transmit power of an antenna, we can calculate how much power we would need to put into an isotropic antenna to get the same peak power as we get in the main beam of a directional antenna  Figure 3.28 . This power is called the effective isotropic radiated power  EIRP . The EIRP is larger than the actual power by the antenna gain, or in dBm:  EIRP = PTX  dBm  + GTX  dBi    3.17   EIRP is often either explicitly or implicitly used as a regulatory limitation on radio operations because it is the EIRP rather than the transmitted power, which determines the peak power density transmitted by a reader, and thus, the likelihood that it will interfere with other users of the same frequency bands. For example, FCC regulations in the United States allow an unlicensed transmitter to use up to 1 watt of power with an antenna with 6 dBi of gain; for each dB of additional antenna gain, the transmit power must be reduced by 1 dB. In effect, the FCC is requiring that the EIRP not exceed 36 dBm  30 dBm + 6 dBi .  A closely related quantity, the effective radiated power  ERP  is also used in similar contexts. However, this term is used rather more loosely: web references can be found in which it is deﬁned in an identical fashion to EIRP, though the United States FCC deﬁnes ERP as being  84   Radio Basics For UHF RFID  Figure 3.28: Deﬁnition of Effective Isotropic Radiated Power.  referenced to a half-wave dipole antenna. In this book, we will deﬁne ERP following the FCC deﬁnition:  ERP = PTX  dBm  + GTX  dBd    3.18   where as the reader will recall, gain in dBd is deﬁned relative to a standard dipole antenna rather than relative to an isotropic antenna. However, we shall generally encourage the use of EIRP rather than ERP since the former is unambiguously deﬁned.  Recall that the purpose of this digression into antenna behavior was to see if we could improve the performance of our theoretical RFID reader by using a directional antenna. If we use a directional antenna to transmit the 1 watt of allowed power and the RFID tag of interest is located within the main beam of that antenna, we would expect the transmitted power density to be increased by the gain of the antenna. The result ought to be an increase in the read range. The argument is depicted graphically in Figure 3.29, for an antenna with 6 dBi of gain.  85   Chapter 3  Figure 3.29: Forward Link Budget Using a Directional Antenna with 6 dBi Gain.  The forward-link-limited range has doubled, from 3 to 6 m, relative to that obtained in Figure 3.22. This is what we’d expect: we increased the signal power by a factor of 4, but power falls as the square of the distance, so this only provides us with a factor of 2 in range. At the same time, we’ve reduced our ability to see tags outside the main beam, presumably around wide here, which is usually desirable: by using a directional antenna we are able to 80–100  mostly  select the region in which tags can be read, and thus exclude tags that are not of interest.  ◦  What about the reverse link? In considering the action of an antenna as a receiver, we have heretofore asserted without detailed proof that the antenna collects energy from some effective aperture, and given a typical size. In fact, the size of the receiving aperture of any antenna is directly proportional to the gain of the antenna when used as a transmitter. This is a conse- quence of the principle of reciprocity, brieﬂy alluded to previously, which for our purposes,  86   Radio Basics For UHF RFID  we can state as: transmitting from antenna 1 and receiving with antenna 2 ought to give the same result as transmitting from antenna 2 and receiving with antenna 1. Since we have already cited the effective aperture for an isotropic antenna  equation  3.15  , we can write:   cid:2    cid:3   ,  λ2 4π  Ae = G   3.19   where the gain G is measured relative to an isotropic antenna, that is in dBi. Using this relationship, we can write a very general equation for the power received from a transmitting antenna TX by a receiving antenna RX if both gains and the distance between them are known:  PRX = PTXGTX  = PTXGTXGRX  = PTXGTXGRX   3.20   Ae,RX 4πr2  λ2 cid:4   4π 4πr2   cid:2    cid:3 2  cid:8    cid:5    cid:6  cid:7   λ 4πr  Friis equation  The last form of the relationship is known as the Friis equation, a very convenient way to state the expected received power. Note that this equation does not imply, as is sometimes erroneously asserted, that waves fail to propagate as wavelength decreases; from the derivation it should be apparent that the factor of λ2 arises from the effective aperture of the receiving antenna and is not related at all to propagation in the intervening space.  With the Friis equation in hand, we can immediately draw the reverse-link diagram for a direc- tional antenna: the received power is simply increased by the antenna gain, just as the transmit power was. The result is given graphically in Figure 3.30. The received power is the same as in the isotropic case, even though the tag is twice as far away because the power at the tag is the same in both cases, and the received power is decreased by 6 dB due to the larger distance but increased by 6 dB due to the receiver antenna gain.  We can also construct a mathematical statement of the same relationships using the Friis equation. We deﬁne the gain of the tag antenna Gtag and a backscatter transmission loss T b  = 1 3 or −5 dB here . We then have:  PTX,tag = PTX,readerGreaderGtag  PRX,reader = PTX,tagGtagGreader  PRX,reader = PTX,readerTbG2  readerG2 tag   cid:2   cid:2   Tb   cid:3 2  cid:3 2 →  cid:2   cid:3 4  λ 4πr  λ 4πr  λ 4πr  87   3.21    Chapter 3  Figure 3.30: Forward and Reverse Link Budgets for Directional Antenna.  As promised, in the most general case, the power received at the reader goes as the inverse fourth power of the  symmetric  distance. It is also proportional to the square of the antenna gains, so when reverse link power is important  e.g. when a semipassive tag, or an unpowered device like a surface-acoustic-wave  SAW  tag, is used  the antenna gain plays a very large role in achievable read range. We have previously treated the tag antennas as having a gain of 1  0 dBi . Real tag antennas have some gain, but it is typically modest  around 2 dBi, since they are usually dipole-like , and since we don’t always control the exact orientation of the tag antenna and may not be able to guarantee that the main beam of the tag antenna is pointed at the reader, it is prudent to count on minimal gain from the tag antenna.  88   Using the Friis equation, we can also, after a bit of algebra, provide a couple of convenient range equations that can be useful for quick estimates. First, deﬁning the minimum power, the tag requires as Pmin,tag we obtain the forward-link-limited range:  Radio Basics For UHF RFID  Rforward =  PTXGreaderGtag  Pmin,tag   cid:2    cid:3  cid:9   λ 4π   cid:9    cid:3   4   cid:2   λ 4π  Rreverse =  PTX,readerTbG2 Pmin, rdr  readerG2 tag   3.22    3.23   and deﬁning the minimum signal power for demodulation at the reader as Pmin,rdr, we obtain the reverse-link-limited range:  One additional antenna parameter is of vital importance in RFID. The reader may perhaps recall that, back in Section 3.1 of this chapter, we described the radiated magnetic vector potential as being in the direction of the current from which it radiates. The vector potential has a direction at each point in space. The electric ﬁeld, which is derived from the vector and scalar potentials, describes the effect these potentials have on electrons in a wire. It is always pointed along that part of the vector potential that is perpendicular to the direction of propa- gation. This isn’t as scary as it sounds: it just means that electromagnetic waves are normally transverse waves. Like a wave on water, the effect associated with the wave is perpendicular to the direction in which the wave is propagating. When the wave from a boat strikes a buoy, the buoy  mostly  moves up and down, and only slightly towards or away from the passing boat. An electromagnetic wave moves electrons in the plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation, not along the direction of propagation. The direction in which the ﬁeld points determines the polarization of the radiated wave. When this direction is constant in time, the wave is said to be linearly polarized.  Unlike water waves, electromagnetic waves are not inﬂuenced by gravity, and the electric ﬁeld can point in any direction in the plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Because human beings are gravitationally challenged, it is most common to orient linearly polarized antennas either vertically or horizontally  Figure 3.31 . However, any intermediate angle is also possible.  It is also possible for the direction of polarization to be time dependent. For example, the electric ﬁeld can rotate around the axis of propagation as a function of time, without changing its magnitude, producing circularly polarized radiation  Figure 3.32 . Depending on the sense of rotation, we obtain either right-handed or left-handed polarization.  Note that the electric ﬁeld of a circularly polarized wave still points in a speciﬁc direction at each moment in time, or at each location along the wave. Circular polarization does not refer  89   Chapter 3  Figure 3.31: Linearly Polarized Radiation.  Figure 3.32: Right-hand-circular Polarization.  90   Radio Basics For UHF RFID  to circulating ﬁelds or potentials but merely to the time dependent orientation of the ﬁeld. Circularly polarized radiation can be regarded as the sum of vertical and horizontal polarized ◦ . By adjusting the ratio of horizontal and vertical compo- waves that are out of phase by 90 nents, and their phase relationship, we can produce elliptically polarized waves of arbitrary orientation, extending from pure circular to pure linear polarization.  The importance of polarization in RFID is simple to grasp: many RFID tag antennas consist primarily of narrow wire-like metal lines in one direction. If the electric ﬁeld is directed along the wire, it can act to push electrons back and forth from one end of the wire to the other, indu- cing a voltage that is used to power the IC and allow the tag to reply. If the electric ﬁeld is directed perpendicular to the wire axis, it merely moves electrons back and forth across the diameter of the wire, producing negligible current, no detectable voltage at the IC, and thus no power.  Figure 3.33: Linearly Polarized Wave Interacting with Linear Antenna.  When a circularly polarized wave impinges on a linear antenna, only the component of the wave along the antenna axis has any effect. Thus, a circularly polarized wave will interact with a linear antenna tilted at any angle within the plane perpendicular to the axis of propagation, but in every case only half the transmitted power can be received.  91   Chapter 3  Figure 3.34: Circular Polarization Interacting with Linear Antenna.  A modest improvement in this situation results when physically larger ‘bow-tie’-like antenna designs are used since electric ﬁelds at small angles to the axis of the antenna can still induce current ﬂow. The best approach to fabricating tags that are polarization independent is to incorporate two dipole antennas on the tag directed orthogonally to one another; such tags are known as dual dipole designs. Note that it is necessary to separately rectify the power from each antenna in order to obtain polarization independence; if we simply add the signals from the two antennas and rectify the result, all we have accomplished is to create a new preferred orientation for linearly polarized waves.  In calculating the link budget, we can take into account polarization for simple linear antennas by projecting the incident electric ﬁeld onto the polarization axis of the antenna. For the case of linear polarization, we just need to multiply by the cosine of the angle between the trans- mitted polarization and the receiving antenna axis, θpol, to get the effect of polarization on the induced voltage. The Friis equation becomes:  PRX = PTXGTXGRX cos2  θpol    3.24    cid:2    cid:3 2  ,  λ 4πr  92   Radio Basics For UHF RFID  and thus the forward-link-limited read range will be found to be proportional to the cosine of the misalignment angle. Note, ﬁnally, that because electromagnetic waves are transverse, there is no electric ﬁeld along the direction of propagation. A simple linear tag antenna oriented along the direction of propagation—that is, pointing towards the reader antenna—sees no electric ﬁeld along the wire axis and therefore receives no power. We have alluded to this fact previously  Figure 3.27  in connection with transmitted power: a dipole antenna does not transmit or receive along its axis.  The polarization of a simple wire antenna is easy to establish by inspection. The polarization of a commercial antenna, particularly when encased in a plastic radome, is not so obvious, and the user must usually refer to the labeling on the antenna or the manufacturer’s data sheets, or use a linearly polarized tag to test the polarization of the radiated ﬁeld. Antennas more complex than simple dipoles may not have the same polarization in all directions; circular polarization often becomes elliptical as the direction of observation moves away from the axis of the main beam.  3.7 Propagation in the Real World  All the calculations we’ve performed so far assume that a wave leaves the antenna and strikes the tag, interacting with no other objects. This kind of calculation is very sensible if the tag and reader are placed in a specially designed anechoic chamber, or perhaps suspended high in the air from  nonmetallized  balloons. In the actual circumstances in which most readers and tags are used, the wave emitted from a reader antenna is likely to interact with many other objects besides the tag.  The interaction between waves that travel along the direct path between the reader and the tag, and those that are scattered or reﬂected, is of counter-intuitively large importance because it is voltages not powers that add. Let us consider, for example, the addition of a direct beam and two reﬂected beams, perhaps from the ﬂoor and a distant wall  Figure 3.35 , each of which contains only 1 10 of the power of the direct signal. We can write the resulting voltage as:  Vtotal cos ωt  =v dir cos ωt   + vr1 cos ωt + δ1  + vr2 cos ωt + δ2    3.25    cid:5    cid:6  cid:7   direct   cid:8    cid:5    cid:6  cid:7   reﬂected   cid:8   Here the δ’s are the phase differences between the reﬂected waves and the direct wave. The phase difference depends on the relative length of the path traveled by each wave; a change in that path of 8 cm  a quarter of a wave  corresponds to a 90-degree phase shift  from a maximum value to zero or vice versa  for the beam traveling that path. It is unlikely  !  that  93   Chapter 3  Figure 3.35: Direct and Reﬂected Beams Can Interfere.  we can measure or control the position of every object in the room to within a couple of centimeters, so we must consider these phase delays as being generally unpredictable and uncontrollable. Thus, the best we can do is to examine the extreme cases. First of all, what if the reﬂected beams happen to both be in phase with the direct beam  δ = 0 vdir ≈ 1.63vdir;   ? We get:   cid:2    cid:3   ≈  ◦  Vtotal = vdir + vdir 3.2  + vdir 3.2  1 + 2 3.2  The received power is about 4 dB higher than in the absence of reﬂections. On the other hand, if the reﬂected beams are exactly out of phase  that is, δ = 180  ◦  Ptotal Pdir  = 1.632 ≈ 2.7  4.2 dB  .  cid:2   ≈  − vdir 3.2  1− 2 3.2 = 0.3752 ≈ 0.14  −8.5 dB  .  Vtotal = vdir − vdir 3.2 Ptotal Pdir   cid:3    , we ﬁnd: vdir ≈ 0.375vdir;   3.26    3.27   That is, the total received power can change by  4.2 + 8.5  =12.7 dB—a factor of 20—even though the reﬂected beams’ combined power is only 20% of that of the direct beam.  94   Radio Basics For UHF RFID  This sort of wild variation in received signal strength with small displacements in position or frequency is known as fading and is an ubiquitous problem in all radio systems. It is exace- rbated in RFID because during the CW portion of an exchange, the reader transmits a very narrow spectrum with essentially only one frequency. Thus, nearly perfect cancellation is possible if directed and reﬂected beams happen to be of the right magnitudes and interfere destructively.  In United States operation, the reader will soon hop to a different frequency within the 902–928 MHz ISM band. The change in phase due to a hop from f 1 to some other frequency f 2 is proportional to the difference in frequency and the difference in the length of the various paths. For example, in Figure 3.35, the path length of the direct path might be  say  1.5 m, and the path length to the wall and back to the tag would be 4.5 m; the path length difference is 3 m. Imagine that a tag is in a deep fade at some frequency f 1. If we shift the frequency by 10 MHz, the phase difference will change by 2π 10 MHz  3 meters  c =  6.28  107  3    3 × 108  = 0.63 radian or about 36 ◦ . This is more than enough to ensure that the signals no longer cancel at the new frequency, though the received power may still be below that of the direct beam on its own. However, in other jurisdictions much less bandwidth is available, and hopping may be impossible or ineffectual in defeating fades. For this reason, it is usually necessary to attempt multiple reads of a tag population in different physical conﬁgurations, for example, by moving the tags or rotating the objects to which they are attached, in order to ensure that all tags are read.  In RFID operation, the most important single reﬂector is the ﬂoor: RFID reader antennas, unlike many other communications systems, are typically oriented to transmit horizontally and are located within a meter or two of the ﬂoor. In many facilities, ﬂoors are constructed of concrete, which has a refractive index of around 2.5 at microwave frequencies, and can act as an effective reﬂector of incident radiation.  Since the concrete acts as a dielectric, the angle of incidence and the polarization of the incident beam are both of importance in determining the reﬂection coefﬁcient. Vertically polarized radiation incident on a horizontal ﬂoor will experience no reﬂection at all at a ◦ particular angle of incidence, Brewster’s angle, which is around 65 the vertical  for microwave reﬂection from concrete  Figure 3.36 . Horizontally polarized radiation beneﬁts from no such effect; the reﬂection coefﬁcient increases monotonically  and monotonously  with increasing angle from the normal. For a reader antenna placed 0.75 m above the ﬂoor, the Brewster’s angle reﬂection point is about 1.5 m away, so the specularly reﬂected location is 3 m away, generally within the range of a typical UHF passive tag. A verti- cally polarized antenna will experience no ﬂoor reﬂection at this distance, and thus produce little local fading  at least due to the ﬂoor reﬂection , whereas a horizontally polarized antenna will produce strong fading in this distance range  Figure 3.37 . Thus, a reader using a linearly polarized antenna will produce more reproducible read results if the antenna is vertically   measured with respect to  95   Chapter 3  Figure 3.36: Reﬂection Coefﬁcient from a Horizontal Plane as a Function of Incident Angle and Polarization, for Refractive Indices of 2 and 4.  polarized; on the other hand, a horizontally polarized antenna will display more prominent fades but also  sporadically  read more distant tags.  In the general case, with many irregular scatterers and reﬂectors present in uncontrolled positions and orientations, a propagation environment can be very complex and quite unpredictable. A simpliﬁed example is depicted in Figure 3.38 in which only reﬂection from walls and ﬂoor of a cubical room is incorporated. It is apparent that the signal strength varies in a complex fashion over size scales comparable to half-wavelength even for a fairly simple environment with no people or furniture. A tag moving within this environment will be easily read in certain regions, and very difﬁcult to read when displaced in an arbitrary direction by 10 or 12 cm. In realistic environments, it is often necessary to attempt to read tags multiple times in differing physical conﬁgurations to ensure that all the tags are read.  We have so far considered only unimpeded straight-line propagation, and specular reﬂection  where the angle of incidence and the angle of reﬂection are the same . In UHF RFID, the  96   Radio Basics For UHF RFID  Figure 3.37: Relative Received Power Considering Only Direct Beam and Floor Reﬂection, vs. Reader Antenna Polarization; n ﬂoor  = 2.5, Beam Width = 75 Degrees.  typical wavelengths of around 32 cm are comparable to the size of many obstacles present in the environment, so to fully treat the propagation environment, we must account not only for propagation and reﬂection, but diffraction: the ability of obstacles of ﬁnite size to scatter the incident radiation in directions other than specular. The full treatment of diffraction is rather complex, and not as important for passive RFID as for other communications ﬁelds since the forward link budget is so small. The importance of diffraction may be roughly estimated by calculating the effective size of an obstacle in terms of the phase difference between the shortest and longest paths through the obstacle  Figure 3.39 . In the ﬁgure, the shortest distance is the direct path  which passes right through the obstacle  and the longest distance goes around the edge of the obstacle. The phase difference is the difference in these path lengths multiplied by the wavenumber k = ω   c:  δφ = k  L1 − L    3.28    A typical value of k for UHF RFID is about 19–20 radians m.  This difference, measured in half-wavelengths  i.e. δφ π, since there are 2π radians of phase in one wavelength , is the number of Fresnel zones subtended by the object. When this number is small  on the order of 1–2 or less , diffraction is important, and the received intensity is a complex function of  97   Chapter 3  Figure 3.38: Simple Simulation of Received Power Distribution for 5 × 5× 5 m Cubical Room with Reﬂecting Walls and Floor  n = 2.5 ; Vertical Polarization, Transmitter at x =1, y = 2.5, z =1.  position, with no well-deﬁned shadow region. When the obstacle subtends many Fresnel zones  >3–5 , it is able to form a fairly well-deﬁned shadow, and tags in that region are unlikely to be visible to the reader.  Consider, for example, a disk of diameter 1 m, illuminated by a reader antenna 2 m from the disk. If a tag is placed 5 cm behind the disk, the difference between the direct path and the path that goes around the edge of the disk is about  2.56–2.05  = 0.51 m, which is about 3 Fresnel zones at 915 MHz  0.51 0.16 . The tag is likely to ﬁnd itself in a deep shadow and not be read  though it is worth noting that if the tag is carefully positioned exactly along the axis of the disk, it will ﬁnd itself in a relatively high-intensity region in the middle of the shadow, known as Poisson’s bright spot, which may allow it to power up . On the other hand, if the tag is placed 2 m from the disk, the path length difference becomes 0.12 m, rather less  98   Radio Basics For UHF RFID  Figure 3.39: Rough Estimate of Diffraction Behavior of an Obstacle is Based on Phase Difference of Shortest and Longest Paths.  than one Fresnel zone, corresponding to weak and complex shadowing. In this position, the tag will move in and out of faded regions as its position relative to the disk and reader changes. In practice, such weak shadowing often simply adds to the complex fading behavior resulting from walls, ﬂoors, and other obstacles that can be treated as specular reﬂectors. Thus, obstacles that are small relative to a wavelength, or distant from both the transmitter and the receiver  reader antenna and tag  have modest though nonnegligible effects, and tags may be read even though the straight-line path from reader to tag is obstructed. Obstacles that are large compared to a wavelength, and close to either the reader antenna or the tag, are likely to prevent passive tags from being read. It is in this sense that RFID is a non-line-of-sight technology even for metallic obstacles.  3.8 Capsule Summary: Chapter 3  Electrical currents and charges radiate, but the net effects usually cancel; an antenna is a special structure arranged to avoid such cancellation and create electromagnetic waves from electrical currents and voltages. These waves are usually periodic in nature and characterized in terms of sines and cosines, or complex exponential functions. They are converted into voltages and currents in electrical circuits. The size of the voltages and related power varies over a large range, so power and gain are usually measured logarithmically, using dBm and dB.  Wave must be modulated in order to transmit information. When a signal is modulated, the width of its frequency spectrum increases. Modulations used for RFID readers are constrained by the need to provide power to passive tags and are thus proﬂigate users of spectrum relative to the amount of information transmitted.  99   Chapter 3  The currents induced in tag antennas, like other uncompensated currents, radiate, leading to backscattered waves. The load connected to the antenna can be varied to change the amount of induced current and thus the backscattered wave, enabling a tag to communicate with a reader even though it has no transmitter. This reﬂected signal adds to other, larger reﬂections from the system and ambient, so there is no simple relationship between the tag state and reader signal; thus, tag modulations are all variants of frequency-shift keying.  The amount of power needed to turn on a tag IC is the main limit on the range of passive tags. Directional antennas increase the power that reaches tags in the main beam of the antenna, but regulations limit the transmitter power and antenna gain that can be used, so the range in air is typically only a few meters. Radiation from antennas is polarized, and if the polarization from the reader antenna does not agree with the polarization the tag can receive, the power received is reduced, and the tag may not be read.  In realistic environments, propagation is greatly complicated by reﬂections from surfaces as well as diffraction around obstacles, leading to local fading and requiring that tags and reader be moved in some fashion to ensure that all the tags have a chance to be read.  3.9 Further Reading  3.9.1 Signal and Signal Processing  “Digital Modulation and Coding”, S.

As such, it faces the same challenges all radios encounter, plus a few specialized problems unusual in wireless communications but well known to practitioners of other passive communication technology, radar.  Every radio transmitter must deliver:    Accuracy: the transmitter must accurately modulate the carrier frequency with the  desired baseband signal and maintain the carrier at the desired frequency.    Efﬁciency: the transmitter must deliver this undistorted signal at the desired absolute output power without wasting too much DC power. The ﬁnal ampliﬁer of the trans- mitter is often the single largest consumer of DC power in a radio.  Low spurious radiation: distortion of the transmitted signal can lead to radiation at frequencies outside the authorized bands, which potentially can interfere with licensed users and is frowned upon by most regulatory authorities.  We’ll discuss in more detail how this spurious output arises in Section 4.3 of this chapter.  Production of clean, spur-free signals is often a trade-off between the amount of RF power to be transmitted and the amount of DC power available for the purpose.    Flexibility: the transmitter should turn off when not in use to save power and avoid creating a large interfering signal, and turn back on again quickly, so as to be res- ponsive when there are tags to be read.  Any radio receiver needs to provide:  Sensitivity: a good radio must successfully receive and interpret very small signals. The ultimate limit on radio sensitivity is thermal noise. In a 1 MHz bandwidth, the thermal noise at room temperature is about −114 dBm or about 4 femtoWatts        103   Chapter 4   4× 10 −15 W . This is much smaller than the received signal power from a passive tag at typical ranges  see e.g. Figure 3.30 . As we will learn in Sections 4.4 and 4.5 below, other factors can degrade the sensitivity of an RFID receiver, but in many cases passive tags are forward-link limited and radio sensitivity is less important than in many other communications systems  though continuing improvement in tag IC’s will make the reverse link more important as time goes on.  On the other hand, if we use semipassive tags, the reverse link becomes the limiting factor, and good receive sensitivity is of paramount importance.     Selectivity: an RFID radio needs to detect the tag signal in the presence of often vastly more powerful interferers. In a facility with many RFID readers operating simulta- neously, the signals from other readers are likely to be much larger than the signals from the tags the reader is trying to communicate with. In addition, other sources of RF radiation such as cellphones and cellphone basestations, cordless phones, and older local area network devices operate in the same or nearby frequency bands. The receiver needs to reject signals outside the channel it is trying to receive, even if they are large compared to the wanted signal.    Dynamic range: the same reader must receive and interpret signals from a tag 3 m from the antenna and a tag 30 cm away—approximately a factor of 10 000 difference in received power. Much greater demands are placed on the receiver if a semipassive tag is to be read at distances of tens of meters.    Flexibility: In passive RFID protocols, the transmitter sends an amplitude-modulated signal and then transmits CW while it awaits a tag response. The receiver must recover quickly from any disturbance resulting from the portion of the modulated signal that leaks into it, in order to hear the small tag response.  An RFID reader radio also has to deal with special challenges. Most RFID readers operate unlicensed: that is, the user of the RFID radio does not require a license from a regulatory body to operate the reader, nor does the seller of the reader own a speciﬁc dedicated fre- quency band solely for their readers. Instead, the reader radio must obey certain restrictions in addition to those imposed on any device. In the United States, radio transmitters and receivers are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission  FCC . A radio opera- ting in the unlicensed ISM band from 902–928 MHz is required to either use wideband ‘digital modulation’, or to hop from one frequency channel to another within the band. United States RFID readers are for the most part frequency-hopping devices. Such a reader must execute a frequency hop to a different channel within the ISM band no less often than once every 0.4 seconds. In a high-speed reading application, it is important to make this hop as rapidly as possible so as to minimize disruption to tag reading.  104   UHF RFID Readers  In Europe, national regulatory bodies generally follow the recommendations of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute  ETSI . ETSI’s recommendation EN302 208 provides a speciﬁc set of operating channels and power levels for unlicensed RFID operation, in the range from 865–868 MHz, and speciﬁcally requires that such readers listen to a given fre- quency channel before transmitting on it.  This requirement is often known as Listen before Talk  LBT .  The sensitivity required to satisfy the LBT requirement is considerably better than that used to receive passive tag signals. ETSI also places stringent requirements on spurious radiation from RFID transmitters.  See Appendix 1 for a more detailed discussion of regulatory requirements, or if you are experiencing an attack of insomnia.   The EPCglobal Class 1 Generation 2 standard imposes special requirements on the spectral width of radiation from an RFID reader that is to be certiﬁed for operation in multiple interrogator or dense interrogator environments. These requirements are generally more stringent than those required by the regulatory bodies cited above, though a vendor is under no legal obligation to seek such certiﬁcation to sell its products.  RFID radios are also required to operate in an unusual manner that puts some special demands on their design. Radios are generally described as either half-duplex or full-duplex, depending on whether they transmit and receive in sequence, or are able to do both simultaneously. Full-duplex radios almost always use separate frequency bands for transmitting and receiving; for example, cellular phones in the United States transmit between 825 and 849 MHz, and receive signals in the band from 869–894 MHz. Half-duplex phones  using the TDMA or GSM protocols  switch their transmitters off when it is time to receive a signal from the base station. Those phones that operate in full-duplex mode  typically those that employ code-division multiple access, CDMA  use a special ﬁlter called a duplexer to allow the received signal to pass into the receiver while directing the transmitted signal to the antenna.  An RFID reader communicating with a passive or semipassive tag must operate in full-duplex mode, in the sense that it must transmit CW for the tag to backscatter while listening for the tag response, but since the tag signal is at essentially the same frequency as the reader’s own signal, a duplexer cannot be used to remove the transmitted signal. Leakage from the trans- mitter to the receiver can be an important limit on receiver sensitivity. This leakage can be minimized external to the radio itself by using separate antennas to transmit the reader signal and receive the tag signal; borrowing from radar terminology, such an arrangement is often known as a bistatic conﬁguration  Figure 4.1 . Such a conﬁguration can ensure that very little of the transmitted signal enters the receiver, if the antennas are properly positioned and no near-antenna obstacles are present to scatter transmitted radiation into the receiving antenna. However, the use of two antennas involves additional size, complexity, and expense, and is obviously impractical in some applications, such as a handheld reader. Alternatively, a single antenna can be used for both transmission and reception: a monostatic conﬁguration.  105   Chapter 4  Figure 4.1: Bistatic and Monostatic Antenna Conﬁgurations.  In this case, it is likely that the receiver input will be exposed to a substantial signal from the transmitter, due at least to reﬂection from the antenna, so the receiver must be designed to detect the tag signal despite the incursion of unwanted transmitted leakage.  Let us brieﬂy examine the magnitude of the quantities involved for the monostatic case. The transmitted signal, as we have seen, is typically limited by regulatory considerations; in the United States, it might be 1 W or 30 dBm. The backscattered signal from a passive tag is essentially determined by the power required to turn the tag IC on, and for a tag a few meters away ends up being about −50 to −70 dBm at the reader  Figure 3.30 . A good- quality antenna will reﬂect about 3% of the power incident on it: such an antenna is said to have a return loss of 15 dB. If the transmitted power is 30 dBm, the reﬂected power is then  30− 15  =15 dBm. This is about  15−  −50   = 65 dB higher than the tag signal for tag ranges of a few meters. The receiver must be able to deal with an unwanted reﬂected power over a million times larger than the tag signal in order to read the tag!  These numbers are generally improved for the bistatic case, as 40–50 dB of isolation between antennas is not unreasonable to achieve. The leakage signal from the transmitter might be  30− 40  =− 10 dBm: still 40 dB  10 000×  larger than the tag signal. Note, however, that if any conductive objects are close to the antennas, or they are not properly mounted and aligned, the isolation may be substantially degraded. In general, an RFID receiver must tolerate large blocking signals from internal and external reﬂections while still detecting the small tag signal.  A semipassive tag, which uses a battery or other power source to operate the circuitry, can potentially operate at ranges of 50–100 meters. The backscattered signal, which falls at 40 dB  106   per decade, will in this case be on the order of −100 dBm. A well-isolated bistatic antenna conﬁguration is indispensable to take full advantage of the capabilities of semipassive tags.  UHF RFID Readers  4.2 Radio Architectures  In this section, we will provide a brief overview of the two basic alternative designs used for radios. In the discussion, we will allude to a number of concepts that will be discussed in more detail later in the chapter; the reader who is at times puzzled is encouraged to charge bravely on in the hopeful expectation that later sections will provide clariﬁcation.  As we saw in Chapter 3, data is usually sent over a radio link by imposing a slow modulation on a fast carrier signal. In the case of a typical RFID reader, the transmitted data rate is typically less than 100 kbps, limited largely by the amount of frequency spectrum allocated to the reader. Somewhat faster modulations are often used by the tags: up to 640 kbps for EPCglobal Generation 2 tags, or 3.25 MHz  at much lower data rates  for EPCglobal class 0. All these signals are much lower in frequency than the carrier signal, typically around 900 MHz. These low frequency signals that describe the way the carrier is to be modulated are generally known as baseband signals. One of the key tasks for a radio is to impose this desired baseband modulation on the transmitted signal, and to extract if from the received signal. These operations are collectively referred to as frequency conversion.  There are two basic frequency-conversion architectures: direct conversion, also known as homodyne, and the multiple conversion or heterodyne conﬁguration. Direct conversion schemes proceed directly, as suggested by their name, from the baseband signal to the radio frequency  RF  signal and back again. Heterodyne methods use an intermediate frequency  IF  in between the carrier and baseband frequencies. In Figure 4.2 we depict schematically these alternatives for the receiver, in which case these are known as downconversion operations. The analogous transmitter case is obtained by ﬂipping the arrows around: upconversion.  The heterodyne architecture was invented by the remarkable American engineer Edwin Armstrong around 1917. It was the dominant approach to the design of radio transmitters and receivers throughout the 20th century, and continues to be important today in many applications. Its popularity stems from the tremendous ﬂexibility that is obtained when multiple conversion steps are used. For example, it is always necessary to ﬁlter out signals at frequencies other than the wanted channel  selectivity . Filtering of a channel of a given width gets harder as we go up in frequency. To select a channel 500 kHz wide at 180 MHz  a plausible value for the IF of a reader receiver , we need a ﬁlter with a bandwidth of about 3% of the center frequency. To perform the same trick at the original carrier frequency of  say  915 MHz, the ﬁlter must have a window only 0.5% of the center frequency: a very  107   Chapter 4  Figure 4.2: Frequency Conversion Approaches.  difﬁcult object to fabricate. Furthermore, by adjusting the frequency of the local oscillator1  LO , which is fairly easy to do as we’ll see in Section 4.3, we can arrange for the IF signal to be at the same frequency no matter what RF channel we’re trying to receive. This pre- caution allows us to use a ﬁxed-frequency IF ﬁlter  easy  instead of a variable-frequency RF ﬁlter  hard  to reject unwanted signals.  On the other hand, the superheterodyne architecture introduces some special problems. As we will see when we cover mixers and frequency conversion in Section 4.3, the conversion process depends on the difference between the frequency of the local oscillator and the input signal  the RF signal when receiving, or the IF signal when transmitting . For example, we can use a local oscillator frequency of 735 MHz to convert an RF frequency of 915 MHz into an IF at 180 MHz:  915− 735 =180. However, an input signal at 555 MHz will also be converted to the same IF:  735− 555 =180. The unwanted but converted frequency of 555 MHz is an image frequency  Figure 4.3 . A similar problem exists when transmitting. Images are always a potential problem in heterodyne architectures. The designer must either ﬁlter out the offending frequencies, or use special  relatively complex and expensive  mixer designs that reject the unwanted bands. Filtering is easier if the separation between the wanted and image signals is large, tempting the designer to use a large value of the IF, but a high IF vitiates many of the advantages of the superheterodyne architecture: ﬁltering and ampliﬁcation are cheaper  1 The local oscillator is what its name implies: a signal source within the radio that generates a high frequency used to perform conversions. The frequency of the local oscillator is usually adjustable, enabling the radio to transmit or receive across a band of frequencies.  108   UHF RFID Readers  Figure 4.3: Both the Wanted RF Signal and the Image are Converted to the Same IF.  and simpler for low values of the intermediate frequency. The optimal choice of LO and IF frequencies for a given application, frequency planning, is an important part of superhete- rodyne design, involving a complex set of trade-offs.  Direct conversion dispenses with messy intermediate steps and goes directly from baseband to carrier and back again. Since all the IF components are eliminated, direct conversion radios are generally more compact and often less expensive than their superheterodyne counterparts. Direct conversion transmission is relatively simple to implement and is popular in many radio systems. The complexity of implementing direct conversion for the transmitter depends on the modulation requirements. If an OOK signal  Chapter 3, Section 4.3  is all that is desired, one may simply interpose a switch between a continuously-operating local oscillator and the output ampliﬁer to switch the output on or off. As we noted in Chapter 3, symbols with abrupt edges tend to use more bandwidth than is strictly necessary, so it is usually desirable to use an analog means of modulation, such as a variable attenuator  a device whose loss is continuously adjustable between a small and large value  instead of a switch. Alternatively, one can adjust the voltage or current available to the output ampliﬁer to modulate the signal; this trick has been used for many years in AM radio transmission. More sophisticated modulation approaches must be used if the phase of the transmitted signal is also to be modulated.  A basic disadvantage of direct conversion relative to superheterodyne conﬁgurations is the problem of ﬁltering: noise and spurious signals generated in the upconversion process can be more readily ﬁltered at an intermediate frequency than at the ﬁnal carrier frequency. When phase is also to be modulated, a direct conversion transmitter must control delays through the system with a precision comparable to the RF cycle time. For example, if we are transmitting a phase-modulated signal at 915 MHz we need to ensure that the output of the modulator is accurate to within a small fraction of the RF period of 1.1 nsec, whereas if we use a 180 MHz IF, the IF period of 5.5 nsec is much more forgiving of errors or misalignments.  109   Chapter 4  The simplest sort of direct receiver uses a diode and capacitor to produce an output voltage proportional to the peak value of the input RF signal. This approach is known as an envelope detector, since the output voltage follows the envelope of the radio signal. Envelope detection is cheap since no local oscillator is required; crystal radios, available as children’s toys in the author’s youth, were essentially envelope detectors with an antenna and earphone. Envelope detection is rarely employed in reader radio designs because it has poor sensitivity and selectivity. However, this technique is widely used in passive tag ICs and will be discussed in more detail in that context in Chapter 5.  Most direct conversion receivers use a local oscillator signal tuned to the same frequency as the incoming RF signal to convert the received signal to baseband. In consequence, direct conversion receivers avoid the problem of images: the wanted and image frequencies are identical. However, they encounter other challenges. Since there is no IF gain and RF gain is expensive, a very large amount of ampliﬁcation is used on the baseband signal. Small DC offsets, which result from ﬁxed-amplitude signals such as the reﬂected signal from the antenna in a monostatic system, may when ampliﬁed reach the limits of allowed input voltage to one of the ampliﬁers and cause it to turn fully on or fully off  in this case the signal is said to be clipped, undesirable except for audio ampliﬁers at concerts frequented by teenagers . An ampliﬁer that is clipped, being e.g. fully off, is unaffected by the small additional signal from the tag, which is thus lost. Even when the ampliﬁer is not completely saturated, its gain for small signals may be reduced—the radio becomes desensitized to the wanted signal. Offsets must be eliminated either by ﬁltering or compensation to allow the wanted small signals to be ampliﬁed and recovered. In addition, at low frequencies many electronic components are much noisier than at typical IF and RF frequencies. Low-frequency noise sources in the ambient may also ﬁnd their way into the radio.  Passive RFID readers encounter a special set of conditions that favor the use of direct conver- sion approaches for both transmission and reception. Readers usually use variants of OOK for modulation of signals sent to the tag, so it is easy to implement direct conversion transmitters. Furthermore, since the reader must transmit a CW signal to provide something for the tag to backscatter, and the backscattered signal is always at essentially the same frequency as the transmitted signal, it makes sense to use part of the CW signal as a local oscillator to directly convert the backscattered signal from a tag into the baseband data signal. UHF RFID readers usually use a homodyne receiver. Like other direct conversion radios, RFID readers must deal with ﬁltering challenges for the transmitter and offset problems for the receiver.  4.3 Radio Components  All radios must perform certain generic functions. Small signals must be made larger  ampliﬁcation , high-frequency signals must be generated  oscillation , signals at different  110   UHF RFID Readers  frequencies must be combined to create new frequencies  mixing , and signals at wanted frequencies must be accepted while other frequencies are rejected  ﬁltering . The components that perform these functions are unsurprisingly known as ampliﬁers, oscillators, mixers, and ﬁlters. In modern radios, signals must always be converted to and from digital form, though in RFID radios it can a bit grandiose to assign the terminology analog-to-digital conversion to the simple comparators and switches that are often sufﬁcient for these purposes.  In Figure 4.4 we introduce common symbols for these components, and depict how each com- ponent modiﬁes the signals it encounters. Depending on the behavior of the reader antenna, the signal entering the reader may be a mixture of a wide variety of frequencies due to many sources of RF energy at differing frequencies and power levels  1 . The band select ﬁlter ideally removes most of the signals outside of the band of interest  e.g. 902–928 MHz for RFID in the United States , leaving signals from one or more transmitters at RF frequencies in the wanted band  2 . These signals are optionally ampliﬁed  3  and then presented to a mixer, where they are mixed with a CW signal from the local oscillator at a constant frequency and amplitude  4 . The result, after low-pass ﬁltering  which removes frequencies above some cutoff, chosen well below the carrier frequency so that the remaining RF and harmonics are eliminated , is a low-frequency signal whose amplitude reﬂects the average signal strength of the high-frequency signal: the signal envelope  5 . This low-frequency signal is ampliﬁed  6   Figure 4.4: A Generic Direct Conversion Receiver, with the Signal Schematically Depicted at Each Stage.  111   Chapter 4  and then converted by an analog-to-digital converter  ADC  into a bitstream describing the baseband signal  7 .  As we discussed in Chapter 3, passive RFID tags are usually limited by the amount of power received from the reader: as long as the tag is operating, it is relatively close to the reader and able to provide a fairly large return signal. Thus the RF ampliﬁer may not be needed, and may be undesirable in a monostatic system where it ampliﬁes the antenna reﬂection and thus increases the likelihood of saturating the mixer. We will also ﬁnd that practical ﬁlters can’t select the narrow RFID bands without including some nearby frequencies, so it may be better to use very linear RF components and ﬁlter the signal after conversion to the baseband. In order to understand how these choices of architecture are made, we need to examine how the components in a radio work: the task of the next several sections.  Ampliﬁers are described by ﬁve key parameters: gain, power, bandwidth, distortion, and noise. Let us examine each of these properties.  4.3.1 Ampliﬁers  4.3.1.1 Gain  The basic purpose of an ampliﬁer is to make a signal bigger, so the most important and fundamental parameter describing an ampliﬁer is the gain. Gain can be measured and reported in several different ways. The voltage gain is the ratio of the magnitude of the output voltage to the input voltage:  Gv = vout vin  .   4.1   Figure 4.5: Ampliﬁers Amplify an Input Signal.  112   UHF RFID Readers  The power gain is the ratio of the output to the input power. By reference to Chapter 3, Section 4.2, we ﬁnd that the power gain is the square of the voltage gain  assuming the input and output have the same load resistance R :  ⎫⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎭ → G = Pout  Pin  2 Pin = vin 2R 2 Pout = vout 2R  =  2 vout 2R 2 vin 2R  2  = vout vin  2  = Gv  2.  Naturally, gain can be reported in dB. Because of the way deciBels are deﬁned, this number is the same whether we are reporting the power or voltage gain:   4.2    4.3   GdB = 10log  = 20log  Pout Pin  vout vin  .  Ampliﬁers that operate at microwave frequencies typically provide 10–20 dB of gain  a factor of 10–1000 increase in the input power . Once the signal has been converted to the baseband frequency range of less than 1 MHz for most RFID systems, gain of 30–50 dB is readily available from a single ampliﬁer stage.  Gain is important because the signals of interest may be small. For example, in an RFID radio receiver, recall from Chapter 3 that the received signal from a tag may be as small as −60 dBm when a tag is a few meters from the transmitter  Figure 3.30 . This amount of power corres- ponds to a peak voltage of around 0.3 mV. To digitize this signal easily we might like it to have a magnitude of around  say  0.3 V, so we need a system voltage gain of 1000 or 60 dB to get the input signal big enough to conveniently convert. We will need more gain than that to make up for the losses encountered in the ﬁlters and the mixer, so a total of 90–100 dB of gain might be present in the radio chain of an RFID receiver.  4.3.1.2 Power  The second important parameter for an ampliﬁer is the maximum output power, often denoted Psat indicating that the output of the ampliﬁer is saturated and can increase no further. Clearly, when the ampliﬁer is saturated, it has no gain: a small change in the input voltage or power has no effect on the output power, which is as high as it can get. A closely related parameter frequently used is the 1-dB-compressed power P1dB : this is the input power at which the gain is 1 dB less than measured at very small input powers. These quantities are depicted in Figure 4.6.  In many types of radios, the designer need give little thought to power handling in the receiver. However, in RFID readers, particularly when using a monostatic antenna, a large reﬂected  113   Chapter 4  Figure 4.6: Output Power vs. Input Power  Logarithmic Scales  Illustrating Saturated and 1-dB-compressed Output Power.  signal is always present, and the designer must ensure that this signal does not saturate the ampliﬁers in the receiver and prevent the tag signal from being read. We will have more to say on this issue in Section 4.5 below.  In designing an RFID transmitter, the output power rating of the ﬁnal output ampliﬁer determines the maximum possible power the reader could provide. As we’ve seen in Chapter 3, the reader power is a key factor in determining the read range for passive tags, so the output power ampliﬁer  PA  must be rated for sufﬁcient output power to provide as much signal as the local government allows. Due to these high-power requirements the PA is often the single largest user of DC power in a reader.  4.3.1.3 Bandwidth  The bandwidth of an ampliﬁer is the range of frequencies it can amplify. Silicon integrated circuit ampliﬁers with substantial gain up to frequencies over 1 GHz are commercially available, and bandwidths of tens of MHz are provided by any modern transistor technology. As we will see, in an RFID receiver, most or all of the gain will be placed in the baseband section and requires quite modest bandwidths. The transmitter ampliﬁers must operate at the full UHF frequency. Appropriate components are no longer a major challenge, particularly  114   UHF RFID Readers  due to the huge market for components used in cellular telephony, which operates in similar frequency bands.  It is important to note that, while sufﬁcient bandwidth is good, excess bandwidth may not be. An ampliﬁer with gain up to frequencies much higher than the intended frequency of operation may be susceptible to unintended parasitic oscillations, due to accidental feedback paths within the circuitry. Such oscillations lead to mysterious and frustrating problems such as sporadic discontinuous changes in output power or gain, and if the resulting signals escape from the radio, they may cause the system to fail to meet regulatory standards for out-of-band emissions.  4.3.1.4 Distortion  The output signal from an ampliﬁer is ideally just the input signal made bigger, and the output is a linear function of the input:  vout = Gvvin.   4.4    4.5   Real ampliﬁers are not so well-behaved: distortion of the output signal is always present. When the distortion is small, it is often possible to regard it as the result of slight curvature or non-linearity in the output. The simplest way to add a bit of curvature to the characteristic of equation  4.4  is to include a quadratic term  proportional to the square of the input voltage , but as we shall see in a moment, a cubic term  the third power  can also play an important role. Thus, a real ampliﬁer with distortion has an output voltage like:  vout = Gvvin + a2vin  2 − a3vin  3  where the a’s are small for a good-quality linear ampliﬁer. The resulting curvature of the relationship between output and input voltage, the transfer characteristic, is shown in greatly exaggerated form in Figure 4.7.  The a’s can be of either sign, depending on the ampliﬁer; the signs above are chosen to be consistent with the ﬁgure.   The effect of polynomial distortions becomes apparent when we examine the effect of such a distorted ampliﬁer on the frequencies present in a signal. Recall from Chapter 3  Figure 3.5  that a simple modulated carrier can be regarded as two frequencies, one above the carrier and one below:  vmod = vs cos ωhit  +v s cos ωlot  .   4.6   If such a signal is ampliﬁed by an ideal linear ampliﬁer, all that happens is that the value of vs increases. However, something more subtle and often more troubling occurs when distortion is  115   Chapter 4  Figure 4.7: Comparison of Transfer Characteristics  Output vs. Input  for Ideal Ampliﬁer and Simple Polynomial Distortions.  present. Let us ﬁrst examine the case of a second-order  quadratic  distortion  a3 = 0 in equation  4.5  . The output signal is:  vout = Gvvs [cos ωhit  +cos  ωlot ]  + a2vs  2 [cos ωhit  +v s cos ωlot ]2  .   4.7    cid:6    cid:7  cid:8   linear part   cid:9    cid:6    cid:7  cid:8   distortion   cid:9   If we multiply out the ‘distortion’ part we obtain:  a2vs  2 [cos ωhit  +cos  ωlot ]2   cid:10    cid:11   = a2  cos2  ωhit  +cos 2  ωlot  +2cos  ωhit cos ωlot   .  Now we use some trigonometric identities  see Appendix 2 : cos a + b  + 1 2 cos 2a  + 1 2  cos a cos b  = 1 2 cos2  a  = 1 2  cos a− b    4.8    4.9   116   UHF RFID Readers   cid:13   to obtain:   cid:12   a2vs  2 [cos ωhit  +cos  ωlot ]2 = a2vs  2  [cos 2ωhit  +cos  2ωlot ]  1 + 1 2 +cos [ωhi + ωlo] t  +cos  [ωhi − ωlo] t    4.10   The distorted signal contains new frequencies that were not present in the original signal. These new frequencies are generally referred to as harmonics and intermodulation products. In this case, the harmonics are at twice each of the input frequencies, and there are intermods at the sum and difference of the original frequencies, as well as a constant term  =zero frequency . These new frequencies are shown pictorially in Figure 4.8.  Figure 4.8: Spectrum of a Two-tone Signal Before and After Second-order Distortion.  To clarify how this happens, the transformation of equation  4.10  is illustrated in Figure 4.9 for the simpliﬁed case of a single input frequency. When the input signal is 0, the output is 0, but when the input swings either high or low, the output voltage is always positive. This means the average output voltage must be positive, even though the average input voltage was 0: the quadratic distortion introduces a DC offset. A half-cycle of the input signal with voltage greater than 0  towards the right in the diagram  produces exactly the same result as a half- cycle with voltage less than 0  towards the left , so each half-cycle of the input must result in a full cycle of the output: that is, the frequency of the input has been doubled.  The good news about second-order distortion is that it is often possible to use ﬁlters to remove the distortion products, because their frequencies are very different from the input frequency. For example, if we imagine the input signal to be a 915 MHz carrier modulated at 50 kHz  so that the frequencies of the tones are 915.05 and 914.95 MHz , the harmonics will be at 1830 MHz, 1830.1 MHz, 1829.9 MHz, and 100 kHz, in addition to a DC component. It is easy to create a ﬁlter that allows the ampliﬁed signal at 915 MHz to pass through while rejecting signals at twice that frequency, and at very low frequencies.  117   Chapter 4  Figure 4.9: A Sinusoidal Input to a Pure Second-order Transfer Characteristic.  What about third-order distortion? Here, the situation is both more complex and less amenable to correction. The mathematics is similar to that of second-order distortion but noticeably more laborious, so let’s focus on the most important part. When we multiply out the cube of the input voltage, we will get terms like:  a3vs  3 [cos ωhit  +cos  ωlot ]3 = a3vs  3  . . . + cos2  ωhit cos ωlot  +. . .  .   4.11    cid:10    cid:11   We can expand the squared part and use the product identity  equation  4.9   twice to ﬁnd:  cos2  ωhit cos ωlot   ⎧⎪⎨ cos ωhit {cos [ωhi + ωlo] t  +cos  [ωhi − ωlo] t }  cid:9   cid:7  cid:8   cid:6  ⎪⎩cos [2ωhi + ωlo] t   ⎫⎪⎬  cid:9  ⎪⎭ +2cos ωlot  +cos  [2ωhi − 2ωlo] t    cid:7  cid:8    cid:6   = 1 2 = 1 4  2fhi−flo  2fhi+flo   4.12   The harmonic at  2fhi + flo  is again much higher than the fundamental frequency; using the same tones as before, this frequency would be  1830.1 + 914.95 =2745.05 MHz, easily removed by a ﬁlter. However, the output at  2fhi − flo  is a much tougher problem. In our example, this harmonic will be found at  1830.1− 914.95  =915.15 MHz, almost identical  118   to the frequency of the tones we’re trying to amplify. In addition to third-harmonic-like terms  including some not shown in the equations above for simplicity , third-order distortion produces distortion products near the input frequencies—often known as intermodulation products—that cannot be ﬁltered out  Figure 4.10 .  UHF RFID Readers  Figure 4.10: Spectrum of a Two-tone Signal Before and After Third-order Distortion.  The origin of the 3rd-harmonic terms is fairly easy to understand and is depicted in Figure 4.11. A pure cubic distortion produces an output in which the near-zero part of the input is ﬂattened out, and the large-magnitude input is ampliﬁed. The result is a narrowed bump with a period corresponding to three times the input frequency, as shown in the inset  Figure 4.11: A Sinusoidal Input to a Pure Third-order Transfer Characteristic.  119   Chapter 4  of the ﬁgure. It is also apparent that the pure third-order distortion of a single tone still contains some component at the original frequency.  The near-carrier intermodulation products  intermods for short  can be viewed as the result of third-order distortion of the modulation signal. Remember that the sum of two tones is the same as the product of a low-frequency modulation and a high-frequency carrier  equation  3.11 , repeated below for convenience as equation  4.13  . The modulation frequency is equal to half the difference between the frequencies of the two tones.

However, it is somewhat more convenient to provide a parameter that allows the designer to estimate the distortion at any input power level. Thus, ampliﬁer linearity is often described in terms of distortion intercepts. Recall from equations  4.10  and  4.11  that the terms resulting from second- and third-order distortion scale as the square and cube of the input voltages, respectively. If this scaling were to be extrapolated to large input voltages, at some input power or voltage the distortion would become equal in magnitude to the linearly ampliﬁed signal. This concept is depicted for second-order distortion in Figure 4.12. In the ﬁgure we have plotted input and output power on a logarithmic scale using dBm, so that second-order scaling of the output power corres- ponds to a line of slope = 2, making it easy to locate the intercept point. The output second-order intercept  OIP2  is the output power at which the linear and harmonic components are of equal magnitude. We can also deﬁne an input second-order intercept  IIP2 ; the two differ by the gain of the ampliﬁer.  The output third-order intercept  OIP3  is deﬁned in an analogous fashion  Figure 4.13 . Here the 3rd-harmonic contribution has a slope of 3 on a log-log  dB  scale. Once the intercept is given, the distortion power can be found at any input power by scaling from the intercept power. This operation is conveniently described in terms of backing off  away from  the intercept: at a backoff of 30 dB from the intercept point, the second-order distortion is  120   UHF RFID Readers  Figure 4.12: Deﬁnition of the Second-order Intercept.  reduced by 60 dB, and the third-order distortion is reduced by 90 dB. Thus for example, referring to Figure 4.12, at an output power of 15 dBm, we are backed off from the second-order intercept by  55− 15  =40 dB. The second-order distortion at this output power is  55− 80  =− 25 dBm. The distortion power is 40 dB below the linear output power. At the same output power, from Figure 4.13, the third-order backoff is 15 dB, and the third-order distortion power is  30− 45  =− 15 dBm, 30 dB below the linear output.  It is important to note that these intercepts are found by extrapolation of measurements at very low power. The intercept points are often at power levels exceeding the saturated output power of the ampliﬁer, which means that other distortion effects would dominate the output signal long before the input power could be increased to the intercept point. An intercept is merely a convenient means for summarizing distortion data at varying power levels.  Reported intercept data can also be misleading. As the output power nears the saturated power, higher-order distortion effects become important, leading to a complex response with the possibility that in some range of power, different distortions will cancel. If we happen to measure an ampliﬁer at this power level, we will get a wonderfully optimistic idea of its linearity, which will not provide accurate guidance when the power level is changed.  121   Chapter 4  Figure 4.13: Deﬁnition of the Third-order Intercept.  Intercepts should be measured by extrapolating distortion power measured at two or more differing input power levels, to verify that the distortion scales in the expected fashion, but this is not always done. Various possible deﬁnitions of the intercepts are also possible. As we have noted, one can quote either input or output intercept power, the values being different by the ampliﬁer gain. The second-order intercept can be deﬁned in terms of the second-harmonic power due to a single input tone, or due to a two-tone input: these approaches are conceptually similar but produce values that differ by 6 dB. Similarly, the third-order intercept can be deﬁned in terms of the third harmonic of a single input tone, or the intermodulation products due to two input tones, the latter being 9 dB lower.  In practice the intermodulation products are usually used to deﬁne OIP3.  Furthermore, one can deﬁne the intercept point as the power at which the power in an intermodulation tone equals the total input power, or at which the power in an intermod is the same as one of the tones in the input, a more modest 1-dB-distinction in this case.  In many applications, the most important distortion issue is the effect of third-order distortion on the near-carrier output spectrum. Recall from Chapter 3 that the data rate of a reader is limited by the width of the transmitted spectrum; if we try to transmit too fast, we use so much bandwidth that we interfere with neighboring channels. Let us imagine that we have gone to  122   UHF RFID Readers  the trouble of smoothing the signal to minimize the width of the transmitted spectrum  as in Figure 3.10 . If we amplify the resulting signal using an ampliﬁer with substantial third-order distortion, the output spectrum will be wider than the input spectrum, because of the crea- tion of additional modulation tones as in Figure 4.10. This effect, often known as spectral regrowth, is depicted qualitatively in Figure 4.14. Excessive distortion in a transmitter power ampliﬁer will cause the transmitted spectrum to spill over into neighboring channels, and possibly also into neighboring bands, leading to interference with both other unlicensed and licensed users. The amount of power radiated into an adjacent channel, relative to that in the intended channel, is the adjacent channel power ratio  ACPR .  Figure 4.14: Third-order Distortion Results in Increased Bandwidth.  Distortion can also play a role in the receiver. Recall that readers in the United States often divide the allowed band  902–928 MHz  into 500 kHz channels. Let us imagine that our reader happens to be transmitted and receiving at  say  915 MHz, listening for the small signal backscattered from a tag. What if two other readers are transmitting at equally-spaced frequencies, for example 917 MHz and 919 MHz? Remember that it is difﬁcult to ﬁlter individual channels at the carrier frequency, so these signals will be passed into the receiver and ampliﬁed  if an ampliﬁer is present  prior to conversion to the baseband. If the receiver is perfectly linear, the interfering signals will be easily ﬁltered out after conversion: the tag reﬂected signal will be at e.g. around 100 kHz, whereas the interfering readers are at 2 and 4 MHz relative to our carrier. However, what if the receiving ampliﬁers have third-order distortion? When we put in two tones at 917 and 919 MHz, the output will contain a new tone at  2 917 − 919  =915 MHz—right on top of our wanted signal  Figure 4.15 ! This interfering signal can no longer be ﬁltered out and may prevent us from demodulating the tag signal. Good linearity  low distortion  in the receiver is particularly important in a  123   Chapter 4  Figure 4.15: Receiver Third-order Distortion creates Interfering Signal from Readers on Distant but Equally-spaced Channels.  dense-reader environment, where many interfering signals are likely to be present, or when nearby signals from other bands  e.g. in the United States, cellular telephony basestations at 869–894 MHz  impinge on the reader.  4.3.1.5 Noise  Any dissipative electrical system creates a certain amount of electrical noise due to the ﬁnite thermal excitation of the electrons. This noise is closely related to the blackbody emissions produced by objects at a ﬁnite temperature, and has a similar frequency spectrum. At typical operating temperatures, the peak emission is in the mid-infrared, much higher than any frequency we are interested in, and so for microwave purposes the noise can be regarded as frequency-independent. For any source resistance R, the maximum noise power is delivered to a matched load of the same resistance, and in this case is independent of the value of the resistance:  N = kT [BW ],   4.15  where k is Boltzmann’s constant, 1.38× 10 C+273 , and [BW] is the bandwidth in Hz. At 300 K  a cozy spot by the ﬁre at the ski lodge for those who can still afford such recreations , this is 4× 10 memorizing if you will be thinking about radio operation a lot. To send 100 kbps of data,  −21 W Hz, or −174 dBm Hz: a quantity worth  −23 J K, T is the temperature in Kelvin  = ◦  124   UHF RFID Readers  a tag will use around 200 kHz of bandwidth. In logarithmic terms, the amount of noise competing with the tag signal in an ideal radio, limited only by thermal noise, will be  −174 + 10log 200 000   = −121 dBm. A quick check of e.g. Figure 3.30 from Chapter 3 shows that this amount of noise is much less than the signal we expect from a passive tag that is close enough to get turned on: thermal noise is of little consequence for a receiver designed for today’s passive tags. However, a semipassive tag may not be limited by the forward link, and the ability to decipher much smaller signals may be important.  Real ampliﬁers emit more noise than the ideal thermal limit. The noise from an ampliﬁer is usually characterized by the ratio of the signal-to-noise ratio on the output of the ampliﬁer to that on the input, known as the noise factor F :   cid:18   cid:18  .   cid:17   cid:17   Sin Nin Sout Nout  F =   4.16   Since the noise factor is always greater than 1 for a real device  the noise on the output can’t be any less than the noise on the input for the same bandwidth , we can also report the noise factor in dB; this latter quantity is usually known as the noise ﬁgure NF:  NF = 10log F   .   4.17   The noise ﬁgure is a convenient quantity, as it can be simply added to the noise ﬂoor from equation  4.15  in dB to ﬁnd the equivalent input noise of the ampliﬁer. The noise ﬁgure is always greater than 0 for real devices. Good-quality ampliﬁers designed for low noise performance have noise ﬁgures from 1 to 3 dB at around 1 GHz. Ampliﬁers designed for high power output may have noise ﬁgures of 10− 20 dB. Thus, for a low-noise ampliﬁer  LNA  with a noise ﬁgure of 3 dB, the equivalent thermal noise level in the 200 kHz channel we are using to listen for a tag will be about  −121 + 3  =− 118 dBm. Recall from Chapter 3 that FM0 requires a  S N  ratio of about 10 dB for reliable demodulation. If thermal noise is the only noise source that is important, the tag signal needs to be about −108 dBm or larger to be decoded. Using equation  3.23  with a transmitted power of 1 watt at 915 MHz, a 6 dBi reader antenna, −5 dB tag modulation efﬁciency, and ignoring any tag antenna gain, we obtain a reverse-link-limited range of about 110 m, greatly in excess of the range achievable with a forward-link-limited passive tag. Note that because of the very strong dependence of signal strength on distance  1 r4 , this result is not very sensitive to the exact value of the noise ﬁgure or transmit power.  125   We will ﬁnd that other noise sources typically limit the sensitivity of a monostatic RFID receiver to a greater extent than thermal noise. A bistatic receiver conﬁguration with good transmit-receive isolation can produce thermal-noise-limited sensitivity, and is more appro- priate for use with semipassive tags.  Chapter 4  4.3.2 Mixers  The operation of a mixer is rather more subtle than that of an ampliﬁer, and deserves some discussion. The purpose of a mixer is to convert a signal from one frequency to another while preserving the modulation information contained in the signal. This operation is accomplished by mixing the wanted signal with a local oscillator  LO  signal that is not modulated—that is, the amplitude and phase of the LO are constant, so it contains no information of its own—as shown schematically in Figure 4.16.  Figure 4.16: Schematic Depiction of Mixer Functional Operation. Note that Filtering Would Normally be Needed to Remove the High-frequency Component of the Output  not Shown Here .  In order to effect this transformation, some sort of nonlinear relationship between the input and output voltages is needed. While elementary treatments of mixer operation often begin with the same sort of polynomial approximations we used in treating ampliﬁer distortion in Section 4.3.2, practical mixers are more realistically approximated as switches, as shown in Figure 4.17. When the switch is on, the input signal is passed directly to the output. When the switch is off, the output signal is 0. If the switch is turned on and off at the same frequency as the incoming signal, the output voltage will be a series of pulses of exactly the same shape. When we ﬁlter the output to remove the high-frequency  rapidly-changing  parts, or equivalently average the output voltage over a cycle or two, we obtain a constant output  126   UHF RFID Readers  Figure 4.17: Operation of a Simple Switch Mixer used in a Direct Conversion Receiver.  voltage. That is, we have converted an RF signal at  in this example  915 MHz into a DC signal at 0 MHz using a switch  mixer  driven at 915 MHz.  It is important to note that the output voltage depends on the relative phase of the switch state and the input signal. If the RF input and the switch are exactly in phase, a maximum ◦ value of output voltage is obtained; if they are 90 ◦ if they are 180 demonstrate that the output voltage is proportional to the cosine of the difference in phase. If we use a direct-conversion mixer to receive a tag signal, and the tag signal happens to be ◦ out of phase with the local oscillator, we get zero output signal even if the tag signal is 90 large. We will discuss some solutions to this problem in Section 4.5 below.  out of phase, a negative voltage is obtained  Figure 4.18 . It is easy to  out of phase, the output voltage is 0, and  Since the output signal depends on the relative phase of the RF signal and the switch  which is the same as the local oscillator phase , if these relative phases change with time, so will the output signal. If the LO frequency is different from that of the RF signal, this is exactly what will happen: the relative phase will change with time, and so will the value of the ﬁltered output voltage  Figure 4.19 . In fact, it is easy to see that the rate of change of the relative phase corresponds to the difference between the two frequencies, and thus a mixer converts  127   Chapter 4  Figure 4.18: Direct-conversion Mixer Output vs. Relative Phase of the RF Input and the Switch States.  Figure 4.19: Operation of a Simple Switch Mixer with Differing RF and LO Frequencies  Heterodyne Conﬁguration .  128   UHF RFID Readers  an RF input to an IF that is the difference between the RF and LO frequencies, as we suggested in Figure 4.3.  Δ phase  =ω RFt− ωLOt =  ωRF − ωLO  t vout,ﬁltered ∼ cos Δ phase   = cos  ωRF − ωLO  t  =cos  ωIFt    4.18   Since the cosine is an even function its argument, cos −x  =cos x  , it doesn’t matter whether the RF frequency is above or below the LO frequency. Therefore if we use a mixer to downconvert a received signal to a ﬁnite IF, both frequencies fLO + fIF and fLO − fIF will be converted to the IF. Either one of these signals could be the one we want to receive, and the other becomes the unwanted image frequency discussed in Section 4.2. The case where we want the sum frequency is known as low-side injection  since the LO frequency is below that of the wanted signal ; the conﬁguration that accepts the difference is known as high-side injection.  A mixer can also be used to upconvert an information-containing signal  baseband or IF  from a low to a high frequency  Figure 4.20 . In this case the mixer is being used as a modulator.  Figure 4.20: Simple Switch Mixer used to Upconvert a Low-frequency  Baseband  Signal to the Carrier  RF  Frequency.  The baseband signal is shown with a sharp transition for clarity, but real baseband signals would be ﬁltered and change state slowly on the scale of the carrier.   129   Chapter 4  Real mixers are implemented using transistors or diodes as switching elements. The LO voltage is connected to the gate or base of the transistor, and switches it between the full-on and full-off states. Transistors have ﬁnite capacitance and switching speed, and the input voltage from the local oscillator is typically sinusoidal, so the transition takes a ﬁnite time, instead of being instantaneous as we have shown above. Furthermore, real transistors have some ﬁnite loss when on, and some leakage when off. Transistors also contribute distortion to the signals, since the conducting regions are not perfectly linear.  4.3.2.1 Mixer parameters: Conversion loss and noise  It is easy to see that the ﬁltered output voltage in Figure 4.18 is quite a bit smaller than the peak voltage, even when the signal and the switch are in phase. In fact, the largest DC output obtained is about 0.32 of the input peak voltage. The output signal of a mixer at the desired frequency is in general smaller than the input signal, even when  as is the case here  the mixer has no internal losses. Mixers have conversion loss.  An active mixer—a mixer that incor- porates an ampliﬁer—can also have conversion gain, though it is always less than that of the ampliﬁer without the mixing function.  An output voltage of 0.32 corresponds to an output power  presuming the RF signal is modulated, so that the output is not quite at DC  of about 10% of the input power; the conversion loss of this mixer is about 10 dB.  The conversion loss depends on a number of factors. For example, the switch in the simple switched mixer used in the examples above is off half of the time, so the average voltage is half of what it would otherwise be. We could make a more efﬁcient mixer by using two switches and a crossover network, so that the output could be connected to the input in either polarity  Figure 4.21 . This conﬁguration is known as a balanced mixer. Now the output is  Figure 4.21: Two Cross-connected Switches can be used to make a Balanced Mixer with Lower Conversion Loss.  130   UHF RFID Readers  always connected to the input, but the polarity of the connection is reversed each cycle, so the average voltage is doubled and the average power increased by a factor of 4. This mixer has an ideal conversion loss of 4 dB instead of 10 dB for the single-switched mixer. The trade-off is added complexity: not only do we require two switching elements instead of one, but the output voltage now appears across two terminals, neither of which is always connected to ground potential: this is known as a balanced or differential output voltage. It may be necessary to convert this voltage to a single-ended signal relative to ground, using a balanced- unbalanced transformer  balun , though if this mixer is incorporated within an integrated circuit, it may be simpler to use the differential signal as the input into subsequent ﬁlters and ampliﬁers, which are often conﬁgured as differential-input devices in any case.  It is often advantageous to also provide balanced connections to the local oscillator, in which case the mixer is said to be double-balanced, or even to both the input signal and local oscillator  a triple-balanced mixer .  Real mixer conversion loss is larger than that for ideal mixers due to the ﬁnite resistance of the switching elements in their ON state. The conversion loss is also dependent on the voltage of the LO signal, since this determines whether the switching elements are fully ON and fully OFF or only partially switched. Since higher LO voltages require more DC power and more expensive components, there is usually a trade-off between LO voltage or power and performance. Real  passive  microwave mixers usually have conversion loss varying from about 6 dB to 11 dB.  Passive mixers generally don’t add much noise of their own to the signal, fundamentally because the switching elements have little resistance in the ON state, and allow very little current in the OFF state. However, the thermal noise present in the output signal must be at least as large as that in the input if the mixer is well-matched to both the source and the load, while the output signal is reduced by the conversion loss. Therefore, the output signal-to-noise ratio must be reduced by at least the conversion loss. The noise ﬁgure of a mixer is at least as large as the conversion loss—in practice a dB or two larger. Active mixers display conversion loss instead of conversion gain, but their noise ﬁgures are generally similar to those of passive mixers, because the underlying conversion loss is still present. Mixer noise ﬁgures of 8–13 dB are reasonable at microwave frequencies.  4.3.2.2 Distortion and isolation  One of the reasons we have pictured a mixer as a switch is to simplify the discussion of mixer distortion, which is otherwise a bit puzzling: why should one worry about the nonlinearity of a nonlinear device? When we think of the mixer as a switch, the answer is clear: the switch ought to be completely on in the ON state and completely off in the OFF state, independent of the amplitude of the signals presented to it. If the output in the ON state is not just  131   Chapter 4  proportional to the input, but instead contains quadratic or cubic distortion terms  like the ampliﬁer case discussed in connection with equation  4.5  , we can expect the same results obtained for ampliﬁers: harmonics and intermodulation products will appear in the output. We can deﬁne second- and third-order intercepts for mixers just as in the case of an ampliﬁer, and use them to provide guidance about acceptable input amplitudes and distortion levels. Mixer distortion is of considerable importance for RFID readers, because of the inevitable presence of a large blocking signal from the transmitter, and the possibility of interfering signals that can’t be readily ﬁltered at RF frequencies. If the mixer has large third-order distortion, pairs of signals may mix to produce interferers at the baseband, just as in the case of an ampliﬁer with third-order distortion  Figure 4.15 .  If the OFF state isn’t quite off, some of the input signal  e.g. the RF signal  will leak into the output. In addition, though we haven’t shown this explicitly, a real switch such as a transistor has some coupling between the local oscillator input and the signal output, mostly due to stray capacitances present in the device and package. Leakage of the RF or LO signals into the IF port, and of the IF into the RF port when the mixer is used as an upconverter, are characterized by specifying the isolation of the mixer. Since there are three ports, we need to specify three isolation values  LO-IF, LO-RF, IF-RF . The local oscillator signal is normally much larger than the received RF signal, so LO-IF isolation is important in downconversion applications. Isolation is also improved by using balanced conﬁgurations. Isolation is not as critical in RFID radios as in many other applications, since direct conversion is usually used and the LO and RF signals are at the same frequency.  4.3.2.3 Spurious Output Frequencies  In our discussion of distortion, we saw that nonlinear ampliﬁcation leads to output signals containing higher harmonics of the input signal, and intermodulation products involving not just harmonics but sums and differences of the input frequencies and integer multiples of the inputs. The whole purpose of a mixer is to produce new frequencies, so it should be unsur- prising to ﬁnd not just the wanted output, but other undesired – spurious—output frequencies, often known just as spurs. In fact, the output of a mixer can in principle contain every possible integer combination of the input frequencies:  fout = nfRF ± mfLO;  n,m integers   4.19   The action of the switch can be regarded as multiplying the input signal by a square wave, and it can be shown that a square wave is made of the odd harmonics of the fundamental frequency, so the odd values of m are likely to be of particular signiﬁcance. Like third-order distortion in ampliﬁers, mixer spurs can end up close to or on top of the wanted output signals, so ﬁltering alone cannot be relied on to remove distortion products.  132   UHF RFID Readers  In addition to lowering conversion loss, balanced mixers can suppress some potential spurious frequencies by symmetry. For example, let us imagine that the switch mixer of Figure 4.17 introduces some quadratic  second-order  distortion, as shown in Figure 4.7. In the single-ended mixer, when the signal goes positive, second-order distortion will cause the output to be larger than it ought to be; when the signal goes negative the switch is off. Therefore, there is an undesired offset. If instead the balanced conﬁguration of Figure 4.21 is used, the negative half of the signal is transferred to the output through a second switch, and is a bit smaller in magnitude than it ought to be. The two distortions cancel when the output is averaged over a few cycles.  It is not trivial to calculate the amplitude of the numerous possible spurious outputs for any given mixer design and conﬁguration. Mixer data sheets will often provide the measured power at each possible frequency at a speciﬁc set of conditions in a spur table, which can be compared against the speciﬁcations for a given design to set limits on allowed power levels.  4.3.3 Oscillators and Synthesizers  It should perhaps be apparent to the reader who has persisted this far that radios need oscillators: components that create a sinusoidal signal at a particular frequency. If the radio is to operate at more than one frequency, the oscillator also needs to be tunable. Finally, the absolute frequency of oscillation needs to be very precisely controlled to satisfy regulatory requirements and avoid unnecessary interference between collocated readers. How are these tasks accomplished?  To introduce the subject of oscillation let us ﬁrst examine what happens if we connect the input of one ampliﬁer to the output of another  Figure 4.22 . In this ﬁgure, the little circle signiﬁes  Figure 4.22: Cross-coupled Ampliﬁers.  133   Chapter 4  that these are inverting ampliﬁers: that is, the output is the negative of the input voltage. As long as the input voltage to the ﬁrst ampliﬁer is 0, the output is 0, so the second ampliﬁer also has 0 volts on input and output. However, let us imagine that some small voltage, e.g. from a bit of noise, appears on the input of the ﬁrst ampliﬁer; in the ﬁgure this is shown as 0.01 V, though the magnitude doesn’t matter. This small input is ampliﬁed  by a factor of 10 in our example  and inverted, and then applied to the second ampliﬁer, where it is again ampliﬁed by a factor of 10, and inverted again. The output of the second ampliﬁer returns to the input of the ﬁrst one as a quite substantial +1-volt signal, which will in turn be ampliﬁed and returned. It is easy to see that in some short time the output of this circuit will grow arbitrarily large and positive, until it is limited by something else, such as the power supply voltage. It is also easy to see that the same thing would happen if the initial voltage happened to be negative, save that the ampliﬁers would be driven to the most negative voltage available.  We can see that this simple circuit generates a signal from nothing, as it were, but the signal isn’t very interesting, being ﬁxed at either the maximum or minimum voltage once it drifts away from 0. To make the signal do something more useful, we need to add a frequency- selective element: a resonant circuit. An example of a resonant circuit is shown in Figure 4.23, along with a roughly analogous mechanical contrivance. The electrical circuit is composed of an inductor—a component in which a magnetic ﬁeld is used to store energy—and a capacitor,  Figure 4.23: Parallel-resonant Electrical Circuit and Mechanical Analog.  134   UHF RFID Readers  in which an electric ﬁeld stores energy. The symbols for these components represent a simpliﬁed view of their construction: an inductor is often a coil of wire, and a capacitor is fabricated using pairs of closely-spaced metal plates. The capacitor is roughly analogous to a mechanical spring, in that the spring stores energy in displacement  charge ⇒ electric ﬁeld , and the mass is like an inductor in that it stores energy in velocity  current ⇒ magnetic ﬁeld .  The operation of this resonant circuit may be roughly understood by examining its mecha- nical analog. When the input force alternates very slowly  input frequency f << resonant frequency fres , the mass can readily follow the input and the spring feels no force and sits still  Figure 4.24 a  . The pivot point, which responds to the sum of the spring and mass displacements, moves with the mass. At very high frequencies, the inertia of the mass keeps it from moving much, but the spring is readily displaced, and the pivot point moves with it  Figure 4.24 c  . However, at the resonant frequency, the spring and mass move with the same velocity, but in opposite directions. The pivot point does not move no matter how much force is applied.  Note that this discussion only applies for small displacements of the crossbar, where lateral motion can be neglected.   Figure 4.24: Mechanical Resonator Response vs. Frequency.  The electrical resonator works in the same fashion  Figure 4.25 . At frequencies well below resonance, current ﬂows in the inductor when a voltage is applied. At high frequencies, current ﬂows through the capacitor. However, at the resonant frequency, equal and opposite currents ﬂow in the two components, and no net current ﬂows into the circuit no matter how much voltage is applied.  In both mechanical and electrical cases, the actual structures have losses  135   Chapter 4  Figure 4.25: Parallel Resonant Circuit Current vs. Frequency.  and other nonidealities, which allow some small residual motion current even at resonance.  For reference, the resonant frequency of an oscillator of this type can be written as:  fres =  √ 1 LC  2π   4.20    4.21   where f is the frequency in Hz, L is the value of the inductance in Henries, and C is the capacitance in Farads. In microwave applications, one more often deals with inductance of a few nanoHenries  nH  and capacitance of a few picoFarads  pF : a 12-nH inductor and a 2-pF capacitor resonate at  fres,12−2 =  1  √ 12× 10−9 · 2× 10−12  2π  ≈ 1 GHz.  We can exploit this resonant circuit to create an oscillator from our cross-coupled ampliﬁers as shown in Figure 4.26. At low frequencies the inductor acts to short the two ampliﬁer outputs together, forcing them to 0 V. At high frequencies, the capacitor does the same job. However, at the resonant frequency, no current ﬂows through the resonant circuit, so the cross-coupled circuit works just like it did in Figure 4.22; the voltage increases until it is limited by some other aspect of the circuit operation. However, now it is the alternating voltage at the resonant frequency that is large in magnitude: the circuit is acting as an oscillator, producing a CW signal at a particular frequency even when there is no input signal. This conﬁguration is also frequently referred to as a negative resistance oscillator.  136   UHF RFID Readers  Figure 4.26: Cross-coupled Oscillator.  Many other oscillator circuits are used, but all share the same basic operating principles as the simple cross-coupled oscillator:        some of the output signal must be fed back into the input, and must be in phase with the input;  some sort of resonant circuit is used to determine the frequency at which oscillations take place.  An oscillator that oscillates only at one frequency is not very useful for a radio. However, if we make either of the resonant elements adjustable, we can adjust the frequency of oscillation. In practice, it is fairly straightforward to fabricate a capacitor whose capacitance varies with the value of a control voltage, by exploiting the capacitance of a semiconductor diode. Such a voltage-variable capacitor or varactor can be inserted into the resonant circuit of an oscillator to obtain a voltage-controlled oscillator  VCO . Virtually every modern radio contains one or more VCO’s to create the transmitted signal and convert the received signal. In practical VCO’s, the varactor may be combined with a bank of switched but ﬁxed capacitors, to simul- taneously provide a wide tuning range  coarse tune using the switched capacitors  and good tuning resolution  ﬁne tune using the varactor  as depicted in Figure 4.27.  4.3.3.1 Phase noise  Real circuits have losses, and as we noted in Section 4.4.1 above, all lossy elements at a ﬁnite temperature emit thermal noise. What happens when a source of noise is present in an oscillator circuit?  137   Chapter 4  Figure 4.27: Constructing a Voltage-controlled Oscillator using a Varactor and Optional Switched Capacitors.  Figure 4.28: An Oscillator with a Lossy Resonant Load, and Simpliﬁed Equivalent Circuit.  A greatly simpliﬁed view of the situation is shown in Figure 4.28. We can regard the loss in the resonator as a resistor  although physically it may be due to resistance in the inductor, capacitor, or wiring . The real noisy resistor can be looked at as an ideal noiseless resistor and a noise current in. The interesting thing to realize is that if the oscillator is actually  138   UHF RFID Readers  oscillating—producing a signal of constant amplitude at the resonant frequency—the action of the cross-coupled ampliﬁers must be just sufﬁcient to cancel the effect of the resistor loss.  This is why this circuit is known as a negative-resistance oscillator.  In the ﬁgure, we can view the resistance R and the ampliﬁer effective negative resistance −R as exactly compensa- ting for each other: thus no current ﬂows into the bottom part of the circuit, and it can be ignored in the remainder of the analysis.  What we have left is a noise current source trying to make current ﬂow through a parallel resonator. Recall that at microwave frequencies, thermal noise is broadband: about the same for all frequencies. So the noise current has the same average magnitude in each chunk of bandwidth; to be speciﬁc, it is:   cid:24    cid:25   2  in  = 4kT R  [BW]   4.22   where the brackets denote an average. Here again k is Boltzmann’s constant, T the absolute temperature in Kelvin, and [BW] is the width of the slice of frequency we’re interested in.  Note that we have to consider the average of the square of the current, because the noise current is a randomly varying quantity, with an average value of 0.   The voltage that results when this current is introduced into the tank circuit is the product of the impedance of the tank circuit and the current. But we noted above that the impedance of the tank circuit grows larger as we get closer to the resonant frequency, in the limit becoming inﬁnite right at resonance, producing a very large voltage from the very small noise current. Thus, the effect of the noise current will be greatly ampliﬁed when we look very close to the resonant frequency, and diminish at frequencies far from resonance. Since the resonant fre- quency is roughly the same as the carrier frequency, what this means is that if we use an oscillator to produce a signal, we can expect the signal to contain lots of noise if we look very close to the carrier frequency.  In a real oscillator, since we are trying to produce a signal of constant amplitude, there is no reason to preserve any variations in amplitude produced by the oscillator, so the output of the oscillator is usually passed through some sort of limiting device to hold it constant. Therefore, the part of the noise that would lead to a variation in the amplitude of the output signal is suppressed, but the part of the noise that changes the frequency, or equivalently the phase, of the signal is not. Oscillators produce phase noise, particularly close to the carrier frequency. In an RFID radio, phase noise is of considerable importance, because the tag signal is at a frequency very close to that of the carrier. In real RFID readers, phase noise from the local oscillator can be the limit on the sensitivity of the receiver. We will examine how this arises in more detail in Section 4.4.5 below.  139   Chapter 4  It is straightforward to show that in our greatly simpliﬁed approximation, the average value of the noise voltage at an angular frequency ω is:   cid:24    cid:25   2  ω   vn  = 4kT R   cid:2    cid:3 2  ωc  2Q[ωc − ω]  [BW ]; Q = R ωcL   4.23   where ωc is the carrier  resonant  frequency, and we’ve introduced a quantity Q, the quality factor of the resonator, which is equal to the ratio of the resistance and the impedance of the inductor L. When Q is large, a resonator is very nearly lossless, and responds in a narrow band of frequencies; when Q is small, the resonator loss is comparable to the energy stored in the resonator, and the circuit is hardly resonant at all. Typical values of Q for resonators built from inductors and capacitors at microwave frequencies are around 10–50.  Since it is not the absolute noise but the amount of noise in proportion to the amount of carrier signal that matters, people generally measure this ratio. Thus, phase noise is usually described in terms of the noise power in some bandwidth in deciBels relative to the carrier power, often written as dBc Hz  although technically the bandwidth goes inside the logarithm . We usually plot the log of the relative phase  dBc Hz  vs. the log of the offset of the measurement fre- quency from the carrier in Hz. If we divide the squared voltage in equation  4.23  by 2R we get the power; dividing by the signal power and taking the log, we ﬁnd:   cid:8    cid:2    cid:11    cid:3 2  Nphase  dBc Hz  =10log  2kT Psig  ωc  2Q[ωc − ω]   4.24   We can see that when Q is large, the phase noise is small. If this phase noise is plotted versus the logarithm of the frequency, we would get a straight line with a slope of −2.  An example of reported phase noise for a commercial VCO is shown in Figure 4.29, plotted over the range of offset frequencies of interest for RFID.  Recall that a tag reply will typically be modulated at a few 10s to a few hundred kHz from the carrier.  The actual value of the noise is about −80 to −120 dBc Hz, and the slope is close to the value predicted from our simple theory.  The phase noise characteristics of real oscillators are, however, often more complex than this, with a region close to the carrier that is noisier than expected from the simplistic model we have presented. The interested reader is referred to Chapter 17 of Lee’s book in Further Reading, at the end of this chapter.  4.3.3.2 Synthesizers  Having established that we can construct a tunable oscillator, how do we tune it to the right frequency?  140   UHF RFID Readers  Figure 4.29: Log-log Plot of Reported Phase Noise for a Commercial VCO Operating in 900 MHz Frequency Bands.  If we’re just trying to operate somewhere in the United States ISM band  902–928 MHz  that might not be too much of a challenge. The precision required is  26 915  =3%, so one could imagine that using 1% precision capacitors, inductors, and resistors, it would be straightforward to build an oscillator with the requisite accuracy—at least at room temperature. However, for example, the EPCglobal standard for second-generation passive tags requires the reader to operate in any of 50 distinct channels in the ISM band, so to satisfy the standard we must be able to hit channels no wider than about 500 kHz. Clearly, it doesn’t do any good to deﬁne a channel and then have the frequency wander around by a substantial fraction of the channel; a variation of the center frequency of less than  say  2% of the channel width seems likely to be ﬁne. Now we’re asking for an accuracy of 10 kHz in 915 MHz, which is 0.001% or 10 parts per million. This kind of accuracy is not achievable using ﬁxed-value components or calibrations; we need to have some sort of feedback control of the output frequency.  In modern radios, accurate frequencies are generated by using a phase-locked loop  PLL  to compare the output frequency of the VCO to a very accurate reference frequency, the latter being provided by a tiny electromechanical resonator made of a bit of quartz crystal. The combination of a PLL, VCO, and appropriate control circuitry forms a frequency  141   Chapter 4  Figure 4.30: A Frequency Synthesizer uses a Phase-locked Loop to Control the Output of a High-Frequency Tunable Oscillator with a Low-Frequency Reference Signal.  synthesizer  synthesizer for short . A simpliﬁed block diagram of a synthesizer is shown in Figure 4.30.  The unique properties of quartz allow the construction of inexpensive resonators with quality factors Q on the order of 106, and very little dependence of the resonant frequency on ambient temperature. Accuracy of a few parts per million is thus achievable. However, typical reso- nators use a bulk vibrational mode in which the frequency is controlled by the thickness of the crystal  essentially, we need to ﬁt a half-wavelength into the crystal thickness , so higher frequencies require thinner crystals. It is straightforward to produce self-supporting crystals that resonate at 10–20 MHz, but much more difﬁcult to produce resonators at 100 MHz, and 900 MHz resonators are not readily available. As a consequence, a quartz resonator is typi- cally employed not directly as the source of the carrier, but as the source of a very stable reference frequency.  The output of the VCO is split, and part of the output is fed into a series of frequency dividers. Dividers are essentially ﬂip-ﬂops, electrical circuits with two stable states and the ability to switch between them when a pulse is applied. A single ﬂip-ﬂop constitutes a divide-by-two circuit: after two input pulses, it has returned to the original state. By combining ﬂip-ﬂops and simple logic, any necessary divider can be realized. The divided output is then sent to a phase detector, which essentially measures the time difference between  for example  the rising edge of the reference signal and of the divider output. When the time difference between the reference and the divided VCO edges is constant, the VCO output is precisely an integer multiple of the reference frequency. The output of the phase detector is ﬁltered by a loop ﬁlter, which is essentially a low-pass ﬁlter that allows only slow changes in the tuning voltage so as to keep the loop stable, and used as the tuning input of the VCO.  142   UHF RFID Readers  The synthesizer in Figure 4.30 is not very ﬂexible: for a ﬁxed N, the output frequency will always be N·fref. A more versatile synthesizer results if the divisor can be easily varied to allow differing output frequencies. One option is the integer-N synthesizer, in which two divisors can be used, differing by 1: for example, 16 and 17. The ﬁrst modulus N is used for  say  S cycles, and then  N + 1  for  S − F   cycles, for a total of F cycles. After all the cycles are done, the divider outputs one rising or falling edge. The net effect is to divide by Neff =  N + 1 S + N F − S  = NS + S + NF − NS = NF + S. Thus, by adjusting S  which just involves setting a counter  the overall divisor and thus the output frequency can be adjusted over a wide range, with a resolution of fref.  If higher resolution is desired the reference frequency can also be divided by some other integer M; in this case, we may speak separately of the reference frequency produced by the crystal and the compare frequency resulting from division of the reference. For example, a 10 MHz reference oscillator signal can be divided by 20 to produce a 500 kHz compare frequency; an integer-N synthesizer will then be able to produce channels spaced by 500 kHz, as required for United States ISM band operation. However, operation under European regulations requires 200 kHz channels. We need to  at least  use a different divider for the reference oscillator to operate in both jurisdictions. We could instead divide the reference oscillator by 100  to produce a 100 kHz reference usable for both United States and European operation , but using larger divisors has a penalty: since the divider outputs an edge only after every Neff cycles of the VCO output, information about the phase of the VCO signal becomes increasingly sparse as the divisor grows. The result is that the variation of phase that can occur without being suppressed by the feedback loop—the phase noise—increases with increasing N or M.  More sophisticated fractional-N synthesizers provide the ability to set the output frequency arbitrarily to within a fraction of a Hertz, by dithering the divider modulus N between two integer values. For example, let us imagine we wish to produce a frequency of 903.25 from a 1 MHz reference. We divide time into intervals, and during 3 of those intervals we use a modulus N = 903, whereas in the fourth interval we set N = 904. The average value of the frequency is the desired 903.25 MHz. Clearly, by adjusting the amount of time spent at each modulus, we can achieve any frequency between 903 and 904 MHz. Because we are no longer tied to integral multiples of the compare frequency, we can use larger values of the compare frequency  smaller values of the divisor M  and thus suffer less phase noise from that source. However, we are essentially frequency-modulating the VCO output, so like any modulated signal this one will contain new frequencies—spurious outputs—resulting from modulation. These spurs are in effect additional phase noise; it is important to choose the dithering frequency so that most of the noise will be out of the frequency bands of interest if possible.  143   Chapter 4  4.3.3.3 Synthesizers and Phase Noise  The addition of the feedback loop and loop ﬁlter has important effects on phase noise. For frequencies near the carrier  closer than the cutoff frequency of the loop ﬁlter , the loop suppresses phase noise in the oscillator by compensating the tuning voltage to hold the output frequency at an integer multiple of the reference. Thus very close to the carrier, the phase noise of a synthesizer may fall, until the lower but still signiﬁcant phase noise of the crystal reference oscillator becomes important.  The loop can’t remove this noise because it locks everything to the crystal; when the reference frequency wanders, so must the output.   At higher frequencies, the loop ﬁlter prevents any correction signal from reaching the VCO, in order to prevent instabilities. Thus as we move farther from the carrier, the phase noise becomes simply that of the VCO by itself. Moving the corner frequency of the loop ﬁlter higher allows the loop to lock to a new frequency more rapidly, and suppresses more phase noise from the VCO, at the possible cost of instability. Corner frequencies typically vary from a few 10s to a few hundred kHz. In a fractional-N synthesizer, the spurious power resulting from dithering may dominate the total output noise in the frequency range corresponding to the rate at which the modulus is changed.  4.3.4 Filters  Filters are circuits that reject some frequencies and transmit others. They are generally classi- ﬁed into three types: low pass, high pass, and bandpass  Figure 4.31 . Filters work with mixers and the LO signal to select the wanted signals and reject both other signals and excess noise.  In a direct conversion radio, ﬁltering is needed at the carrier frequency and at baseband.  Since there is no IF stage, no IF ﬁlters are used.  In the receiver, an RF band ﬁlter may be used to select for signals in  for example  the ISM band. Unfortunately, as we’ll see below, available ﬁlters are not able to reject all frequencies near the reader band, so the heavy lifting in rejecting out-of-band interferers as well as selecting the desired radio channel within the band must all be done in the baseband ﬁlters.  4.3.4.1 RF Filters  A bandpass ﬁlter made of discrete components is essentially a resonant circuit, like that of Figure 4.23. The ideal resonator shown there, with no losses, would only pass the resonant frequency, but real circuits have ﬁnite losses, characterized as we noted previously by the quality factor Q. Losses cause a resonant circuit to allow a ﬁnite band of frequencies to pass through it; the bandwidth is inversely proportional to Q  Figure 4.33 .  Note that the output frequency characteristic shown in the ﬁgure is normalized to 1 ohm for convenience; a different value would change the position of the peak but not the bandwidth.  As shown  144   UHF RFID Readers  Figure 4.31: Three Types of Filters with Common Schematic Symbols.  Figure 4.32: Simpliﬁed Receiver Block Diagram with Band-select and Channel-select Filters.  in the right half of the ﬁgure, the quality factor also determines the width of the passband of the ﬁlter. Narrow passband ﬁlters must have very high Q: for example, an RF band ﬁlter for the 902–928 MHz ISM band must have a bandwidth on the order of 3% of the center frequency, requiring a Q of at least 30. In practice considerably higher Q is needed to make a good ﬁlter: the ﬁlter ought to have a fairly ﬂat transmission in the passband and a sharp transition to very low transmission in the stopbands, rather than the peaked behavior shown in the ﬁgure. The challenges are very stringent. For example, in the United States, cellular telephone basestations operate in the frequency band from 869 to 894 MHz  and may transmit at power levels of 100 W or more! . In order to provide 40 or 50 dB of rejection of a signal at 893 MHz while accepting a signal at 903 MHz with minimal loss, we need a Q of several  145   Chapter 4  Figure 4.33: Simple Filter using Parallel Resonant Circuit, and Bandpass Characteristics.  hundred. On-chip ﬁlters constructed with inductors and capacitors in Si CMOS processes are generally limited to Qs of about 10, mostly due to loss in the inductors. Discrete components offer Qs of up to 20–30 at these frequencies, but complex ﬁlters with many elements constructed using discrete components will become physically large and are inappropriate for GHz frequencies.  On the other hand, if all that is needed is to reject second- and third-harmonic radiation from the transmitter  i.e. to pass transmissions at 915 MHz but reject 1830 MHz , discrete ﬁlters with Q around 10 are quite sufﬁcient.  Better technologies with high Q, small physical size, and low cost are needed to provide band selection ﬁltering. There are several methods of providing ﬁlters with high quality factors and small size at microwave frequencies. Many of these approaches depend on the fact that acoustic  mechanical  vibrations travel much more slowly than electromagnetic waves, so a resonant structure containing one or more wavelengths of sound can be much smaller than an analogous device employing electromagnetic resonances.  An important example of an electromechanical ﬁlter technology is the surface acoustic wave  SAW  device.  The reader may recall that we mentioned SAW-based RFID tags in Chapter 2; these use a similar technology to that of SAW ﬁlters to produce delayed encoded reﬂections.  SAW ﬁlters achieve Qs in the hundreds, are available in surface-mount packages, and can pass hundreds of milliwatts without damage. SAW ﬁlters are relatively expensive  $0.50 to $10 . Packaged ﬁlters are on the order of 1 cm square, large enough that the number of ﬁlters must be minimized both to conserve board space and minimize cost. Chip scale packages with an  146   UHF RFID Readers  area of only a few square millimeters have recently become available, allowing ﬁlter insertion with little penalty in area. The resonant frequency of a SAW ﬁlter is somewhat temperature- dependent; quartz ﬁlters are better in this respect than most other piezoelectric materials, but are more expensive to fabricate.  A simpliﬁed SAW ﬁlter structure is shown in Figure 4.34. The device is constructed on a piezoelectric substrate such as quartz, LiNbO4, or ZnO. Electrical tranducers are constructed of a layer of a conductive metal such as aluminum, deposited and patterned on the surface of the piezoelectric using techniques similar to those used in integrated circuit fabrication.  The input transducer consists of on the order of 100 interdigitated ﬁngers, driven at alternating polarity from an RF source. Between each pair of ﬁngers an electric ﬁeld is formed within the piezoelectric material, inducing a time-dependent strain, which creates an acoustic wave. For an input frequency such that the spacing between ﬁngers is half of the acoustic wavelength, a resonant enhancement of the wave will occur as it propagates along the transducer, as each alternating region of strain will be in phase with the wave and add to the displacement. The resulting strong acoustic wave propagates to the smaller output transducer, where the acoustic strain induces an electric ﬁeld between the electrodes, resulting in an output voltage. The slice of piezoelectric is often cut at an angle to the propagation axis, so that the acoustic energy which is not converted back to electrical energy is reﬂected off the edges of the substrate at an odd angle and dissipated before it can interfere with the desired operation of the ﬁlter. Since the acoustic wave propagates about 10 000 times more slowly than electromagnetic radiation, wavelengths for microwave frequencies are on the order of 1 micron, making it possible to create compact, high-Q ﬁlter designs.  Figure 4.34: Simpliﬁed Surface-Acoustic-Wave Filter.  147   Chapter 4  Figure 4.35: Transmission vs. Frequency for a Typical SAW Filter centered on the United States ISM Band, showing Deﬁnitions of Insertion Loss, Shape Factor, Out of Band Rejection.  The performance of a fairly typical RF band  or image-reject  ﬁlter is shown in Figure 4.35, as the transmission in dB through the ﬁlter vs. frequency. Within the ISM band, the loss through the ﬁlter is only about 2.3 dB ± 0.3 dB: this transmission is known as insertion loss, since it is the loss in band due to insertion of the ﬁlter in the circuit. Low insertion loss is important on both transmit and receive, though since transmit ﬁlters generally only need to provide harmonic rejection, a SAW ﬁlter may not be needed. The insertion loss of the transmit ﬁlter comes directly out of the signal power, so lossy ﬁlters mean bigger transmit power ampliﬁers that cost more and consume more DC power. On the receive side, the ﬁlter loss is essentially equal to its noise ﬁgure, and since the ﬁlter is typically placed prior to the low-noise ampliﬁer or mixer, the ﬁlter noise ﬁgure must be added directly to the noise ﬁgure of the receiver.  Other important properties of a ﬁlter are the sharpness with which transmission cuts off once the frequency is beyond the edges of the band, and the transmission  hopefully small, thus rejection  of out-of-band signals. The bandwidth in this case at a 3 dBdecrease in trans- mission vs. the center frequency is about 41 MHz, rather noticeably wider than the 28 MHz ISM band: signals about 6–7 MHz outside of the band will have little rejection. Transmission falls quite rapidly thereafter: the shape factor, the ratio of bandwidth at 20 dB rejection to 3 dB rejection, is about 1.4. The rejection of signals far from the band edges—such as the 824–849 MHz cellphone uplink frequency band—is a substantial 40 dB or better. However,  148   UHF RFID Readers  this ﬁlter only provides about 3 dB of rejection at the high end of the cellular downlink band. A nearby cellular basestation operating at the high edge of the band will not be rejected by a band select ﬁlter, but instead must be removed after baseband conversion. Such an interfering signal may combine with other interfering signals  such as other RFID readers  due to third- order distortion in the receiver front-end, to produce interference at the reader frequency that cannot be ﬁltered out. As a consequence, RF ﬁltering may not be sufﬁcient to protect the reader from interferers, and instead it is necessary to ensure good linearity in the mixer and  if used  RF ampliﬁer.  Other commercially-available ﬁlter technologies include bulk-acoustic wave  BAW  devices, which use a thin layer of piezoelectric material and can handle higher power densities than SAW ﬁlters, and dielectric resonator ﬁlters, which use electrical resonances of a high- dielectric-constant block.  4.3.4.2 Baseband Filters  Once the tag signal has been downconverted, the bandwidth of the resulting spectrum is typically less than 1 MHz, though a few protocols use higher-frequency tones of 2–3 MHz. The ﬁrst task of ﬁltering the baseband signal is to accomplish channel selection: that is, to pass the signal from the wanted tag s , which is usually within a few hundred kHz of the reader’s LO frequency, while rejecting signals at higher frequencies, corresponding to other readers or devices operating in neighboring channels. For example, we may wish to receive the signal from a tag using FM0 modulation at a data rate of 100 kbps, in the presence of a reader a couple of channels away  1 MHz if the channels are 500 kHz wide . The signal to be rejected is now 50 times higher in frequency than the wanted signal, and the frequency of operation is low, so it is straightforward to construct ﬁlters based on networks of inductors and capacitors to accept the wanted signals.  It is often desirable to combine ampliﬁcation and ﬁltering; such a dual function can be readily accomplished at baseband frequencies using an inverting differential ampliﬁer whose output is determined by the difference in the voltage applied to its two inputs. A simpliﬁed baseband ampliﬁer circuit using such an ampliﬁer is shown in Figure 4.36. When a resistor is connected between the output of such an ampliﬁer and the input—that is, when feedback is introduced— the gain of the circuit becomes dependent only on the resistor values, as long as the ampliﬁer gain is large. Such a conﬁguration is often known as an operational ampliﬁer or op amp.  If the voltage gain of the ampliﬁer, K, is large, it is reasonable to assume that the terminal voltage of the ampliﬁer  v−–v+  must be small for reasonable values of the output voltage. In the case shown, since the positive terminal is grounded  ﬁxed at 0 volts , the negative input terminal voltage must also be very close to 0. This fact enables us to analyze the circuit very  149   Chapter 4  Figure 4.36: a  The Output of a Differential Ampliﬁer is Proportional to the Difference of the Inputs; b  Adding Feedback Produces an Operational Ampliﬁer.  Figure 4.37: a  Simple Analysis of Circuit Gain for OP Amp; b  Frequency-dependent Gain Results from Introducing a Capacitor in the Feedback Circuit.  simply using only Ohm’s law and the further assumption that the ampliﬁer input current is very small  typically true for practical ampliﬁers . The current ﬂowing through R1 must equal the current ﬂowing through R2 if no current ﬂows into the ampliﬁer  Figure 4.37 a  . We ﬁnd:  vin R1  = − vo R2  → vo vin  = − R2 R1  .   4.25   150   UHF RFID Readers  This expression is not dependent on frequency  though a real operational ampliﬁer circuit does have a frequency dependence due to the ﬁnite bandwidth of the differential ampliﬁer . However, it is apparent that if we could reduce the feedback resistance R2 with increasing frequency, the gain of the circuit would decrease: we would obtain a low-pass ﬁlter circuit. We can approximately accomplish this goal by placing a capacitor in parallel with the resistor  Figure 4.37 b  . Capacitors permit little current to ﬂow at low frequencies, but pass current readily at high frequencies. Mathematically, the impedance of a capacitor falls inversely with frequency  see Appendix 3 :  Zc = 1 jωC  .   4.26    4.27   When this impedance is large compared to the resistor, little current ﬂows in the capacitor and the circuit acts as if the resistor were not present, providing a constant gain. When the capacitor impedance is much less than that of the resistor, current ﬂows only through the capacitor and the gain falls inversely with frequency. The boundary between these two regions, the cutoff frequency ωc, is the frequency at which the resistor and capacitor impedances are of equal magnitude:  R2 = 1 ωcC2  → ωc = 1 R2C2  .  To produce a cutoff frequency of 200 kHz, we need a resistance of 5000 Ω and a capaci- tance of 160 pFd, both values being readily available.  In an integrated implementation it might be helpful to use a higher resistance value and less capacitance.  An op amp with these component values, and an input resistance of 1000 Ω, will provide a voltage gain of 5 at low frequencies, and a rejection of about 13 dB for a 1 MHz signal vs. a 100 kHz signal. More elaborate feedback networks can be used to create more abrupt ﬁlter charac- teristics, and use of switchable resistors or capacitors can produce ﬁlters with adjustable frequency characteristics. Combining multiple stages of such active ﬁlters can be used to accurately select the bands containing most of the tag information while rejecting noise and interfering signals. Filtering can also be used in the transmitter to smooth the transmitted symbols, resulting in a narrower output spectrum.  It is also possible to dispense with most of the analog ﬁltering of the baseband data by conver- ting the baseband signal to a digital data stream at a sufﬁciently high sampling rate, and perfor- ming ﬁltering and other signal processing digitally, bringing us to the topic of the next section.  4.3.5 Digital-Analog Conversion  All RFID readers, like most other modern radios, use a digital data stream to create the transmitted signals, and convert the received signal into digital data for decoding and  151   Chapter 4  interpretation. Because of the limitations of passive tags, the corresponding modulations used in reading them are simple variations of on-off keying for the downlink  reader-to-tag  and frequency-shift keying for the uplink  tag-to-reader . It is therefore possible to use very simple means to perform the requisite conversions, as shown in Figure 4.38. On the transmit side, a digital output  perhaps through a buffer ampliﬁer  can be used to control a switch, turning the transmit power on and off as needed. On the receive side, a comparator—a device whose output is some ﬁxed voltage +V when the input is greater than a threshold, and 0 when the input is less than that same threshold—can be used to capture the zero crossings from the tag signal, which determine the frequency. Both of these approaches amount to conversion between digital and analog signals with 1-bit resolution.  This one-bit approach to digital radio is adequate for RFID readers, but the use of more capable conversion processes with higher resolution enables the reader to add capabilities through changes in software rather than hardware. On the transmit side, symbols can be smoothed digitally, allowing optimal adaptation to differing data rates and protocols. On the receive side, use of digital ﬁltering allows the bandwidth and center frequency of the received signals to be adjusted to account for different tag data rates and interference conditions. The trade-off between analog and digital signal processing is complex and subtle, but as compu- ting power increases and software algorithms improve, the balance tilts toward more digital signal processing  DSP  power and simpler analog circuitry.  Figure 4.38: Simple Conversion between Analog and Digital Domains using a Switch and Comparator.  152   UHF RFID Readers  In order to exploit the power of DSP, more capable analog-to-digital converters  ADC  and digital-to-analog converters  DAC  are needed. There are numerous approaches to performing conversion. We will examine two common approaches.  For converting a digital signal to an analog voltage, a common approach is to use a current- steering DAC  Figure 4.39 . The total current entering the inverting terminal of the op amp is the sum of the current from each of the legs. Since this current must also ﬂow through the feedback resistor Rf, applying Ohm’s law we ﬁnd the output voltage:  cid:3    cid:2   vo = Rf  cid:2   b1vref  + b2vref  cid:3  cid:2  2R  R  + b3vref 4R  + b4vref  cid:3  8R  =  vrefRf  R  b1 + b2 2  + b3 4  + b4 8   4.28   where bi = 1 or 0 depending on whether the relevant switch is open or closed. The switch positions bi can thus be regarded as the bits of a binary number  b1 b2 b3 b4 , determining the output voltage. The resolution of a current-steering DAC is determined by  Figure 4.39: Simple 4-bit Current-steering Digital-to-Analog Converter.  153   Chapter 4  the number of stages, which is in turn limited by the accuracy with which the resistor values of the ladder can be constructed, and the extent to which the reference voltage can be held constant as the switch conﬁguration varies. If a DAC is used to control the output power of a transmitter, higher resolution will permit more precise smoothing of the output signal and contribute to a narrower output spectrum and thus less interference with readers on neigh- boring channels.  The corresponding analog-to-digital converter, a ﬂash ADC, uses a ladder of 2n resistors to divide the reference voltage into 2n slices. Each resistor has a comparator one of whose terminals is connected to the input voltage and the other to the slice of the reference; by recording the location where the comparators switch states, the input voltage is digitized. Flash ADC’s are very fast but high resolution requires a large number of accurately-matched resistors and comparators.  A more common analog-to-digital conversion architecture is the sigma-delta converter  Figure 4.40 . The sigma-delta ADC performs successive approximations to the input voltage, using a DAC; the difference of the input voltage and the DAC estimate is integrated and fed to an ADC. The result is used to improve the DAC estimate. The resolution of the ADC doesn’t need to be very high, since its job is only to see if the DAC estimate is too high or too low: a single bit is sufﬁcient. The digital output is the setting of the DAC at the end of some number m of approximation cycles, where m is roughly the resolution of the DAC.  Commercially-available ADC’s provide resolutions of 15 bits and sample rate of 100 million samples per second  Msps , greatly in excess of what is needed to digitize the baseband signal for the relatively low data rates used in RFID. To capture a signal of bandwidth BW, one must sample the signal at a frequency of at least 2 BW—one of the many results due to the proliﬁc  Figure 4.40: Sigma-Delta ADC.  154   UHF RFID Readers  Harold Nyquist. The highest commonly-encountered frequency, the 3.3 MHz tone used in EPCglobal class 0 tag data, would require a sampling frequency of 6.6 MHz. A resolution of 15 bits means that the smallest resolvable signal is about 90 dB below the largest signal, assuming that noise in the conversion is negligible. One can therefore choose to use inexpen- sive, low-power digitization chains with just enough sampling speed to capture the signal, or spend more power and money to sample a broad band with high resolution, enabling the use of more sophisticated and ﬂexible digital processing to provide much of the channel selection ﬁltering and interference rejection.  4.3.6 Circulators and Directional Couplers  In a monostatic conﬁguration  Figure 4.1 , a single antenna is employed to simultaneously transmit a CW signal to power the tag, and receive the backscattered signal. If the receiver were simply connected directly to the transmitter, and both antenna and receiver were well-matched, half of the transmitted power would be directed into the receiver. In such a case, not only is half of the transmit power being wasted, expensive in terms of component size and cost and power consumption, but the receiver is subjected to a huge blocking signal  on the order of 1 2 W  while trying to capture the tag signal  on the order of a nanowatt . It would be helpful if the signal leaving the transmitter were directed only to the antenna, and the returned signal from the antenna were directed only into the receiver, as indicated schematically in Figure 4.1.  There are two basic ways to accomplish this end. The ﬁrst is to use a special microwave component known as a circulator  Figure 4.41 . A circulator is a 3- or 4-port device in which signals introduced into any port come out only at the next port. For a 3-port coupler, an input signal at port 1 appears at port 2, an input signal at port 3, and a signal at port 3 comes out at port 1.  Not only is this a neat trick, it is also a violation of the principle of reciprocity that we used in Chapter 3, Section 4.6: if we ignore port 3, putting a signal into port 1 produces a signal at port 2, but a signal at port 2 produces no signal at port 1. Such violations are possible because the circulator contains a bit of ferrite—an iron-oxide-based mixture with very high magnetic permeability—placed within a constant magnetic ﬁeld created by permanent magnets. The electrons in the ferrite act like tiny magnets, and tend to orient themselves along the external magnetic ﬁeld. If they are prevented from doing so by minor obstacles like conservation of momentum, they will rotate in a plane perpendicular to the ﬁeld: that is, they precess, much like a gyroscope held at an angle to the vertical. Magnetic ﬁelds are oriented: a current circu- lating in a counterclockwise direction in a horizontal plane produces an upwards magnetic ﬁeld, whereas a clockwise current produces a downward-directed ﬁeld. So the precession of  155   Chapter 4  Figure 4.41: 3-Port Circulator Operation.  Figure 4.42: Precessing Magnetic Moment and Circularly-polarized Waves Propagating along the External Magnetic Field.  the electron gyroscopes is preferentially in one direction  counterclockwise if we watch the tip of the magnetic dipole . A right-hand-circularly polarized wave  see Chapter 3, Section 4.6  propagating along the ﬁeld is rotating in the same direction as the electrons are precessing, and will interact differently from a left-hand-circularly polarized wave  Figure 4.42 , though the  156   UHF RFID Readers  details are rather complex and dependent on the frequency and external ﬁeld. Thus, right-hand and left-hand waves will travel at differing speeds in the ferrite.  Armed with such a non-reciprocal material, we can construct a circulator by placing a pair of ferrite disks on either side of a metal conductor with three conductor lines in a Y-conﬁguration forming the three ports  Figure 4.43 .  A wave entering one port can be roughly regarded as splitting into right-hand circular and left hand circular waves within the disk. Because the disk is a ferrite, and a magnetic ﬁeld is applied, the propagation velocities need not be equal for the left- and right-going waves. If we can arrange the geometry and magnetic ﬁeld so that the phase shift of  say  the right-hand   from port 1 to port 2, and the left-hand circular wave suffers a circular wave is 2π 3  60 phase-shift of π 3 from port 1 to port 3  and thus 2π 3 from port 1 to port 2 , at port 2 the waves will combine in phase:  ◦  At port 3, the phase shift of the right-going wave will be doubled to 4π 3, so we ﬁnd:  φrt [port 2] = 2π 3  = φleft [port 2]  φrt [port 3] = 4π 3  = φleft [port 2] + π   4.29    4.30   Figure 4.43: Simple 3-Port Circulator  Note that ground planes above and below the disk are suppressed for clarity .  157   Chapter 4  ◦ That is, at port 2 the two waves are π radians  180 symmetry the same applies to the other two ports, so a wave entering at any port comes out at the next clockwise port, as desired.    out of phase and cancel. Obviously by  Circulators can also be constructed using various combinations of microwave coupling devices and ferrite phase shifters  known as gyrators . Ferrites can also be used to create isolators that pass signals in only one direction.  Practical commercial circulators achieve insertion losses of around 0.5 dB  that is, essentially all the power in comes out at the desired port  and port-to-port isolation of about 20 dB. This level of isolation is not very good—remember that we’re trying to see a −60 dBm signal in the presence of a +30 dBm CW transmission—but it doesn’t really hurt much, as the reﬂection from the antenna, which cannot be removed by the circulator, is typically only around 15 dB less than the transmitted power. However, circulators are relatively large  typically 2–3 cm in diameter and 1 cm thick , and commercial units are expensive, costing as much as US$200 for a 900 MHz unit.  An alternative approach to separating the transmitted from the reﬂected signal that is more compact and less expensive is to use a directional coupler. A directional coupler extracts a small portion of waves traveling in one direction on a transmission line  e.g. to the right  while being essentially impervious to waves traveling in the other direction  e.g. to the left . Directional couplers can be constructed using two weakly-coupled transmission lines, where coupling is obtained simply by designing the lines to travel near each other on a printed-circuit board. The maximum coupled signal is obtained for a line length of a quarter of a wavelength; shorter couplers can be used to remove only a small portion of the signal.  Figure 4.44: Schematic Depiction of a Coupled-line Directional Coupler; Transmitter Power PTX in at Port 1, Received Power PRX from Antenna at Port 2.  158   UHF RFID Readers  Commercial couplers of dimensions less than 2 cm on a side and only a few mm thick are available, and can be conﬁgured to mount directly to a printed circuit board. Couplers are also relatively inexpensive, on the order of US$10. However, because a coupler is a reci- procal device, if the coupler extracts a large amount of power from the reﬂected signal, it also extracts a large amount of power from the transmitted signal  though this appears at port 4 and is normally dissipated in the terminating resistor . In order to save transmitted power, it is typical to employ a 10-dB coupler: the coupled signal is 10% of the incident power, so the transmitted signal only encounters about 1 dB of loss, but the reﬂected signal from the antenna is attenuated by 10 dB in passing through the coupler. This loss in signal power affects sensitivity; we will examine the consequences of this loss in more detail when we consider radio chain analysis in Section 4.5 of this chapter.  4.4 RFID Transmitters  An RFID transmitter has two basic tasks. In the downlink phase, it must provide power to start up passive tags, and modulate its signal so as to send the tags commands and data. In the uplink phase, the transmitter must provide an unmodulated signal that the tag can back- scatter in order to return data to the receiver. The transmitter must be able to operate on any of a number of radio channels with accuracy of a few parts per million in frequency, and switch from one channel to another rapidly, in order to meet the requirements of unlicensed use. In order to obtain good read range, the transmitter should provide the maximum output power allowed by the relevant regulatory bodies. In handheld or portable applications, it should do so while consuming as little DC power as possible.  The transmitter’s task is rendered signiﬁcantly more complex by the presence of other radio devices, and in particular other RFID readers. In normal far-ﬁeld-coupled operation, the transmitter radiates and can interfere with distant radio receivers. Recall from Chapter 3 that the radiated spectrum of a modulated signal is much wider than that of an unmodulated signal, and that typical RFID modulations, which are optimized for powering the tag, are very inefﬁcient users of spectrum. Regulatory requirements for radiation out of the allowed bands are often very stringent. It is ordinary practice to provide guard bands by refraining from use of channels immediately adjacent to the edge of the allowed band. For example, in the United States, a reader may place its lowest channel at 902.75 MHz, so that the region of 902–902.5 MHz is unused, but radiation at frequencies below the lower edge of the ISM band  902 MHz  is reduced. In this fashion, interference with other  possibly licensed  spectrum users is reduced, but no particular beneﬁt is obtained for other users of the unlicensed bands.  In order to reduce interference between unlicensed users, and in particular from one reader to another, it is helpful to minimize the width of the radiated spectrum. Protocols may place speciﬁc requirements on the amount of power radiated into neighboring channels by imposing  159   Chapter 4  a spectral mask requirement; we shall examine the EPCGlobal Generation 2 dense reader mode mask in Chapter 8. Filtering of the transmitted symbols can reduce the radiated power far from the carrier, as we demonstrated in Chapter 3. Alternative modulation techniques, still simple enough to be deciphered by passive tags but more parsimonious in their use of bandwidth, may also be used, as we will discuss below.  4.4.1 Transmitter Architectures  The simplest transmitter consists of a synthesizer to provide a carrier signal, a switch to turn the signal on and off, and an ampliﬁer to provide sufﬁcient output power  Figure 4.45 . However, as is shown schematically in the inset, the resulting spectrum is very broad with substantial radiated power in the adjacent channels, where it may interfere with other readers.  A better approach is to use a variable attenuator so that the signal may be smoothly switched on and off  Figure 4.46 . It is readily apparent that the spectrum resulting from transmission of ﬁltered  smoothed  symbols is much narrower than that from switched symbols. An RF attenuator is a bit more complex than suggested in the ﬁgure: if a single variable resistor were used, the signal would be reﬂected rather than merely absorbed when the resistance value was different from the impedance of the surrounding circuitry. A useful attenuator uses three resistive elements, e.g. in a ‘π’ conﬁguration  parallel series parallel ; as the series resistor increases, the parallel resistors decrease, so that the attenuator always presents a matched  typically 50 Ω  load. The resistive elements can be p-intrinsic-n  PIN  diodes, or transistors. PIN diode attenuators require additional passive components for biasing, but transistor-based attenuators may introduce signiﬁcant additional distortion in the signal, broadening the  Figure 4.45: Simple Switched Transmitter Architecture; Inset shows Radiated Spectrum  unﬁltered PIE modulation .  160   UHF RFID Readers  Figure 4.46: Transmitter using Variable Attenuator and Filtered  Smoothed  Symbols; Inset shows Radiated Spectrum  Ideal PIE Modulation and Filtering .  Figure 4.47: Transmitter using Variable Bias Supply to Modulate Output Power; Inset shows Radiated Spectrum  Ideal PIE Modulation .  spectrum and vitiating some of the beneﬁts of ﬁltering. Attenuators are somewhat more expensive than switches, and introduce additional loss, so higher gain ampliﬁers must be used to compensate. Furthermore, if a linear power ampliﬁer is employed  which is desirable for producing minimal distortion , the ampliﬁer draws power even when the input signal is off.  A more elegant approach to ﬁltering the signal is to vary the DC power supplied to the power ampliﬁer, as depicted in Figure 4.47. By varying the supply power to the output ampliﬁer, the transmitter power can be smoothly changed while minimizing DC power consumption when  161   Chapter 4  the pulse amplitude is small.  This is a very old trick, based on the variation of plate voltage of very-high-power tube ampliﬁers to impose AM on broadcast radio signals.  Reducing the DC voltage may introduce both changes in the delay  which show up as unintended phase or frequency modulation of the output signal  and additional distortion in the signal, so some calibration may be needed to establish a range of voltages in which the ampliﬁer is well- behaved. A similar approach, which may produce less variation in the ampliﬁer charac- teristics, is to control the bias current in the ampliﬁer. Bipolar transistor ampliﬁers often use a small reference transistor in a current mirror conﬁguration to control bias current; it is relatively simple to vary the current in the reference transistor to vary the output power.  The transmitters described above only provide control of the amplitude of the transmitted signal, and don’t change the phase of the carrier  except accidentally . The ability to modulate phase as well as amplitude provides a powerful tool, and is widely used in many areas of wireless communications. Phase modulation can improve signal detection in the presence of noise, and reduce the amount of spectrum required for a given data rate. The use of phase modulation in passive RFID is constrained by the fact that the tags can only extract the amplitude of the reader’s signal. Nevertheless, there remain modulation techniques that provide improved spectral efﬁciency while still allowing simple demodulation. Let’s take a look at two of these approaches, and their implications for transmitter architecture.  The ﬁrst approach is known as phase-reversal amplitude shift keying  PR-ASK , which can also be regarded as a variant of duobinary encoding. To implement PR-ASK for a simple binary data stream, we simply invert the phase of each successive binary 1  Figure 4.48 . The  Figure 4.48: OOK and PR-ASK Encoding of a Binary Data Stream. The Dotted Lines show the Lowest Frequency Sine Wave that must be included in the Spectrum to Reproduce the Data. Symbols are shown Unﬁltered for Clarity.  162   UHF RFID Readers  highest-frequency OOK data stream is a series of alternating 1-0-1-0...; when such a stream is transmitted using simple on-off keying, even with perfect smoothing, we must have at least a sine wave of frequency equal to half the data rate in order to preserve the information in the signal; this is shown by the dotted line in the ﬁgure. When this baseband signal is used to modulate the carrier, the resulting modulated signal spectrum will have energy at least half the data rate above and below the carrier frequency. Using PR-ASK, the envelope of the RF signal is identical, but the essence of the baseband signal can be described using a sine wave of frequency equal to a quarter of the data rate. The modulated signal is half as wide as that for OOK.  Note that real symbols would likely be smoothed  ﬁltered  to minimize excess spectral width due to abrupt transitions between bits, as was discussed in Chapter 3, Section 4.3.   Recall that reader symbols are usually encoded in some fashion that avoids loss of power during long strings of zeroes, such as pulse-interval encoding  Chapter 3, Section 4.3 . Using PIE, each symbol needs to end with a brief period in which the transmitted power is low or zero. We obtain this nice result from PR-ASK modulation if we simply invert the phase of every symbol rather than just every binary 1, since the baseband signal must pass through zero each time it changes sign. Note that in the case of PIE, the highest frequency is obtained from a string of binary 0’s rather than alternating symbols.  In order to impose this phase inversion on the transmitted signal, we can use a mixer instead of an attenuator or switch to modulate the signal, so that the sign of the baseband voltage is preserved  Figure 4.50 . We need to use a balanced mixer like that in Figure 4.21.  We could instead use a pair of switches and a delay element, but this is more complex and because of the delay element is likely to be sensitive to the RF frequency used.   One other approach to creating a signal that uses minimal spectral width but can still be demodulated by a passive tag is single sideband  SSB  or vestigial sideband  VSB   Figure 4.49: String of PIE-binary 0 Symbols Encoded using Amplitude-shift Keying  left  and Phase-reversal ASK  right ; Symbols are shown Unﬁltered for Clarity.  163   Chapter 4  Figure 4.50: Transmitter using  Balanced  Mixer to allow Phase-reversal Modulated Signal; Note the Baseband Signal is shown Unﬁltered for Clarity.  modulation. Recall that amplitude modulation of a carrier produces two sidebands, one above and one below the carrier frequency  Figure 3.5 and equation  3.11  . In SSB modulation, only one of these sidebands is preserved, the other being completely removed using techniques to be described below. In VSB, the signal is ﬁltered  typically at a con- venient intermediate frequency  to remove most of the upper or lower sideband.  VSB is used in the NTSC television standard, for similar reasons: video images require a lot of bandwidth, but in the 1930s and 1940s, when the standard was being developed, it was simpler to implement ﬁltering on the transmitter, and envelope detection in the television receiver.  As long as the carrier and one sideband remain, the tag can still demodulate the signal using only amplitude-sensitive detection.  To understand how this scheme works, it is useful to introduce a graphical approach to viewing a modulated signal: the phase plane. We imagine the instantaneous state of the signal as a cosine of some phase and amplitude. Such a signal can also be represented as the sum of a sine and cosine of appropriate amplitudes:  a· cos ωct  +b · sin ωct  =c · cos ωct + φ  c =  a2 + b2 φ = arctan  √   cid:2    cid:3   b a   4.31   164   UHF RFID Readers  Figure 4.51: Geometric View of Addition of I and Q Signals to Create a New Sinusoidal Signal of Arbitrary Phase.  If we plot the amplitude of the cosine on the horizontal axis of a graph, and the sine on the vertical axis, the length of the resulting vector is the amplitude of the signal, and the angle from the x-axis is the phase  Figure 4.51 . The cosine signal is the in-phase or I component of the signal, and the sine is the quadrature  Q  component.  Thus, by adjusting the I and Q signals we can produce changes in the amplitude and phase  or frequency, which is just the dependence of phase on time  of the signal. In particular, to produce a single tone offset in frequency from the carrier  that is, a single sideband , we apply an in-phase signal modulated with the cosine of the modulation frequency, and a quadrature signal modulated with the sine of the modulation frequency:  a = cos ωmt ;  b = sin ωmt    4.32   The resulting output signal rotates in phase relative to the carrier at a rate of fm: that is, it is a cosine with frequency fc + fm: a single sideband  Figure 4.52 . The lower sideband can be produced by inverting the sign of the quadrature component, resulting in clockwise rotation. If we combine the upper and lower sidebands, the resulting total signal is along the real axis: a modulated cosine. The double-sideband signal is the modulated cosine we introduced in  165   Chapter 4  Figure 4.52: Sidebands in the Phase Plane.  Chapter 3; the length of the vector to the resulting signal varies with time, so a tag can extract information from the amplitude of the signal. However, if we remove one of the sidebands, the amplitude of the total signal is ﬁxed and only the phase varies; a tag cannot demodulate this signal. Pure single-sideband modulation can’t be used for passive tags.  To create a signal that has a varying amplitude while preserving a narrow spectrum, we need to add some carrier. This corresponds to a constant offset of the single-sideband signal along the real axis  or some other axis, as the relative phase is arbitrary . Figure 4.53 shows a single-sideband signal with carrier in the phase plane, the corresponding spectrum and signal amplitude vs. time. This signal has half the spectral width of the double-sideband signal shown in Figure 4.52, while preserving amplitude variation readily decipherable by a passive tag.  166   UHF RFID Readers  Figure 4.53: A Sideband with Carrier Produces an Amplitude-modulated Signal with Reduced Spectral Width.   In traditional amateur-radio single-sideband modulation, the carrier could be suppressed to save transmit power, and then added back at the receiver end, since the human operator could adjust the phase and amplitude of the injected carrier until human-sounding speech was heard.   The SSB signal has a rather complex relationship between instantaneous amplitude and phase during the RF cycle. The most straightforward and ﬂexible approach to creating such a signal is to use an I Q modulation architecture. This approach corresponds exactly to the phase plane depiction of the signal: two mixers are provided, one for the in-phase signal and ◦  , and the one for the quadrature signal  produced by phase-shifting the carrier signal by 90 output signal is the sum of the two upconverted signals. The I and Q signals are the base- band input to the two mixers; by adding the mixer outputs we obtain the desired signal. The required I Q upconverter is shown in Figure 4.54. The two mixers are often combined with the phase shifter into a single component, sometimes known as an analog quadrature modulator  AQM , in order to ensure good matching of amplitude and phase between the two branches. To produce a single-sideband output, the input voltage to the I mixer contains a DC bias voltage  to produce the carrier contribution  and a cosine at the modulation fre- quency. The Q branch need only receive a sine if the carrier is to be in-phase.  Since any modulated signal can be viewed as a path in the phase plane, the I Q modulator can be used not just for SSB signals but for more complex signals combining phase and amplitude modulation, not as relevant to passive RFID but widely employed in other areas of wireless communications.  167   Chapter 4  Figure 4.54: I Q Modulator Architecture for SSB, with Output Signal and Spectrum.  4.4.2 Transmit Power Efﬁciency  In the United States, an RFID reader can transmit up to 1 W in the ISMband.  The transmitter may produce a bit more than that to account for losses in the circuitry and cabling.  A substantially larger amount of DC power may be required to produce this single watt of RF output. The output ampliﬁer may be the largest single user of power in the system, and of considerable importance in operating lifetime of portable and handheld devices. It is worth a brief investigation to understand the origin of this inefﬁciency.  To convince ourselves that it is possible for an ampliﬁer to efﬁciently convert DC power into an RF signal, let’s examine a greatly simpliﬁed ideal current ampliﬁer  Figure 4.55 . The ampliﬁer consists of a current source whose output current is linearly proportional to the input voltage:  iamp = gmvi = gm  Vb + cos ωct     4.33   168   UHF RFID Readers  Figure 4.55: Ideal Voltage-controlled Current Ampliﬁer.  where the constant of proportionality is known as the transconductance of the ampliﬁer. The bias voltage Vb is imposed to allow the output current to both increase and decrease with the sinusoidal input, since in real ampliﬁers the current can only ﬂow in one direction.  If there were no bias voltage, the ampliﬁer would act as a rectiﬁer, amplifying only the positive-going part of the input voltage.  Real ampliﬁers have a maximum current they can provide, Imax; in the simplest sort of ampliﬁer  known formally as a class A ampliﬁer , the bias voltage is chosen so that the output current when there is no sinusoidal input signal is Imax 2, and thus the largest possible sinusoidal output signal has amplitude Imax 2.  In this greatly simpliﬁed circuit all the output current ﬂows through the load resistor RL. By Ohm’s law the voltage across the resistor is the product of the current and resistance. The RF power provided to the load is the product of the variable part of the current and voltage, averaged over a cycle of the signal. For the maximum output signal, we have:  Pload =   cid:5   RL   cid:6  cid:7   Imax 2 voltage  cos ωt    cid:8    cid:5  · Imax 2   cid:6  cid:7   cos ωt   current  = RLImax  2  4   cid:10   cid:5    cid:11   cid:8   cos2  ωt    cid:6  cid:7   →1 2   4.34    cid:9   cid:8    cid:4   = RLImax  2  8  The most sensible way to choose the load resistor is to set the value so that when the current is equal to the maximum current, all the supply voltage appears across the load resistance and none across the transistor. Since the DC bias current is chosen to be half the maximum  169   Chapter 4  current, in the condition when there is no sinusoidal input  the quiescent state , the voltage on the transistor is half the supply voltage, the same as the voltage across the load resistor. The DC power dissipated in the transistor is then:  The efﬁciency of the ampliﬁer is:  PDC = RLImax  2  Imax 2  = RLImax  2  .  4  η = PRF PDC  = 0.5 → 50%.   4.35    4.36   That is, it’s not unreasonable to hope that half the DC power is converted to RF power in the output ampliﬁer.  In fact, much higher conversion efﬁciencies can be obtained using more complex ampliﬁer conﬁgurations, known as class B, class C, and on into the alphabet.  It ought to take 2 watts or less of DC power to deliver 1 watt of RF power to the transmitter output.  This optimistic view of the situation falls apart when we recall from Section 4.3.1 above that real ampliﬁers are not perfectly linear, but distort the input signal. In particular, recall that third-order distortion leads to intermodulation products that are very close to the signal itself, and cannot be ﬁltered out. We wish to use a high data rate in order to count tags rapidly, but when we do so the output spectrum increases in width, even if the symbols are smoothed  e.g. Chapter 3, Figure 3.10 . The best we can do is to choose a data rate that results in use of the whole channel we are operating in. If we now introduce third-order distortion to the resulting signal, the spectrum grows wider  Figure 4.14 , resulting in radiation in the neighboring channel. To keep the amount of power in the adjacent channels—the adjacent channel power ratio, ACPR—small, we must back off from the third-order intercept power. Recall that the signal from a tag a few meters from an antenna may be as small as −60 or −70 dBm  Figure 3.30 ; to keep a nearby reader in an adjacent channel from interfering with the tag, the amount of power it radiates into the adjacent channel should be much lower than that in its own channel. Let’s imagine that we wish the ACPR to be  say  30 dB—that is, the power radiated into the neighbor channel due to distortion should be 1000 times smaller than that in the channel we’re operating in. Using the IP3 values  Figure 4.13  as a rough guide, we need to back off from the output intercept by 15 dB from OIP3. If the OIP3 is 10 dB higher than the maximum output power of the ampliﬁer, a fairly typical result, then the distortion-limited output power is 5 dB  3-fold  smaller than the maximum power the ampliﬁer can provide. The calculation is depicted schematically in Figure 4.56. The ampliﬁer efﬁciency, which we at ﬁrst hoped would be around 50%, is now  50 3  =17%. A nominal 1-watt ampliﬁer will provide only 330 mW of output power and require 2 W of DC power; to achieve the desired legal limit  170   UHF RFID Readers  Figure 4.56: Output Power is Reduced to Ensure that 3rd-order Distortion is 30 dB Smaller than Linear Power.  of 1 W, we now need an ampliﬁer with a nominal output power of 3 W, and DC power consumption of 6 W.  In practice design requirements vary considerably, and the designer may choose to trade a reduced data rate for reduced power consumption and cost  high power ampliﬁers at 900 MHz are expensive . At the other extreme, to provide maximum performance and minimize linea- rity concerns, the designer may choose a power ampliﬁer rated at 10–20 W maximum output to provide 1–2 W of actual output power.  4.4.3 Phase and Amplitude Noise  Because an RFID reader for passive tags is transmitting at the same time the receiver listens for the tag response, there is always some leakage from transmitter to receiver. In a monostatic conﬁguration  Figure 4.1 , this leakage is dominated by the signal reﬂected from the antenna back into the receiver, and is typically around 15–20 dB below the transmitted signal. In a bistatic conﬁguration, TX-RX isolation of 30–40 dB is achievable.  171   Chapter 4  There are a couple of basic sources of noise in the transmitted signal. The ﬁrst is phase noise from the oscillator  Section 4.3.3 above . To get an idea of the magnitude of the phase noise contribution, let’s use the example shown in Figure 4.29. The frequency range of interest is that corresponding to the tag signal; for a tag data rate of 100 kbps we might want to look at frequencies from around 50 kHz to 100 kHz from the carrier, where the phase noise is typically about −95 to −105 dBc Hz. Very roughly speaking, the bandwidth is around 50 kHz or 45 dB from 1 Hz, so the total noise will be about  −95 + 45  =− 50 dBc in this band. Let us imagine that the transmitted signal is 1 W  30 dBm , of which 15 dBm is reﬂected from the antenna and sneaks into the receiver. The received phase noise is then approximately  15− 50  =− 35 dBm. If on the other hand a bistatic arrangement is used, the injected signal from the transmitter starts at around 0 dBm  or better  and the phase noise is then −50 dBm.  In practice, as we will discuss in the next section, receivers are typically arranged with I and Q channels, and the absolute phase of the leakage signal determines how much of this noise ends up in each channel.   To convert this phase  or frequency  noise into a voltage in the baseband receiver, we need the output voltage of the mixers to be affected by the frequency of the signal. In general, the mixers are not terribly sensitive to frequency on their own, so if the instantaneous frequency varies for both the local signal and the reﬂected signal from the antenna, and both are in phase, no variation in the output voltage results. That is, the average value of the product is:   cid:4   cid:5    cid:8 Vmixer cid:9  =   cid:6  cid:7    cid:8    cid:5   cos [ω + δω] t   local oscillator  cos [ω + δω] t  antenna reﬂection   cid:6  cid:7   = 1 2  ,   4.37    cid:9   cid:8   independent of the frequency variation δω. However, in many cases the antenna reﬂection is not in phase with the local oscillator signal, but is delayed because it needs to travel down some circuit board traces and cables to the antenna and back again  Figure 4.57 . This delay leads to an absolute change in the phase of the reﬂected signal; for some frequency and delay ◦ and become a sine. In this case, the average value of values, the cosine will be shifted by 90 the output voltage of the mixer will be 0:   cid:8 Vmixer cid:9  =   cid:4   cid:4    cid:5   cid:6  cid:7   cid:8   cos ωt  local oscillator   cid:5   cos ω [t + τ]  antenna reﬂection   cid:6  cid:7   cid:5   cid:6  cid:7   cid:8   sin ωt  when ωτ= nπ  4 , n odd  =  cos ωt    cid:9   cid:8   cid:9   = 0.  172   4.38    UHF RFID Readers  Figure 4.57: Delayed Antenna Reﬂection Mixes with Local Oscillator.  When the reﬂected signal is in quadrature like this, small variations in frequency disturb the perfect null condition and result in a ﬁnite average output voltage. The output is no longer independent of frequency:   cid:4   cid:8  cos [ω + δω] t  sin [ω + δω] t + δω· τ  ≈sin [ω+δω]t +δω·τ cos [ω+δω]t    cid:6  cid:7    cid:5    cid:9    cid:2 Vmixer cid:3  =   4.39   δω· τ  ≈ 1 2   This sort of scheme can be constructed intentionally as a method of demodulating a frequency-modulated signal, where it is known as a delay line discriminator.   A typical cable might be 1 m long and propagation velocities in coaxial cable are typically around 60% of the velocity of light in vacuum, so the delay  recalling that the signal must travel out and back  is around 10 ns. For the range of frequency offsets from the carrier  δω  we were considering above, 50 to 100 kHz, the sensitivity of the output voltage  δωτ is roughly  1 2  δω· τ = 1 2  2π · 75× 103  10× 10 −9   4.40    cid:13  ≈ 2× 10  −3   cid:12    cid:13 · cid:12   173   Chapter 4  Since power goes as the square of the voltage, the phase noise power is reduced by a factor of about 5× 10 −6 or 53 dB in being converted to amplitude noise. Thus, the equivalent amplitude noise at the receiver resulting from phase noise in the transmitter VCO is around  −35− 53  = −88 dBm. Imagine we need the received signal to be around 13 dB larger than the noise; in this case a signal of −75 dBm would be needed for reliable demodulation, which just happens to be the reader receive threshold shown in Figure 3.30 of Chapter 3. Go ﬁgure.  The phase noise entering the receiver can be reduced by using quieter synthesizers, typically increasing cost and power consumption, or by reducing the transmitter leakage into the receiver. A bistatic reader can expect to achieve 15− 25 dB lower phase noise than a monostatic reader, assuming good antenna isolation.  The other source of noise from the transmitter is amplitude variation in the transmitted signal. The desired output of a VCO is a sine wave with no variations in amplitude, so nothing stops us from putting a limiter on the output of the VCO to strip out any amplitude variations  noise  in the oscillator signal. However, the VCO output is typically at around 0 dBm. To get one watt at the transmit antenna, we need 30 dB of gain between the VCO and the output. Recall that an ideal 50-ohm source at room temperature produces −174 dBm Hz of bandwidth of thermal noise. For the band we’re considering  50− 100 kHz, or 50 kHz wide , that’s −174 dBm +57dB = −117 dBm. This is the  minimum possible  noise entering the ampliﬁer chain from the matched output of the VCO or limiter. An ideal ampliﬁer would simply amplify this noise by the gain of the ampliﬁer: we’d get about  −117 + 30  = −87 dBm of thermal noise at the power ampliﬁer output. Real ampliﬁers add excess noise, described by the noise ﬁgure NF; if the noise ﬁgure were 10 dB, the actual thermal noise is around −77 dBm at the transmitter output. About 3% of this power, roughly −92 dBm, bounces off the antenna and enters the receiver. These estimates are depicted graphically in Figure 4.58.  Just as in the case of phase noise, what happens then depends on the relative phase of this reﬂected signal and the local oscillator; if the two are in phase  equation  4.37  , the output of the mixer will be linearly dependent on the amplitude of the received signal, so the amplitude noise is converted directly into noise in the baseband of the receiver.  In practice, the receiver has both an I and a Q channel; if by happenstance the I channel is in phase, the Q channel will be in quadrature, so one receiver channel will be dominated by amplitude noise and the other by phase noise.  For our simpliﬁed example, we obtain a receiver threshold for reliable demo- dulation of  −92 dBm + 13 dB  =− 79 dBm: modestly better than the phase-noise-dominated case.  To reduce the amplitude noise from the transmitted signal, we can use lower-noise  more expensive!  ampliﬁers to reduce the noise ﬁgure of the system. If a mixer is used to modulate the output signal instead of a switch, any amplitude noise present in the VCO signal is generally removed since the LO drive level is high enough to cause the mixer to act as nearly  174   UHF RFID Readers  Figure 4.58: Amplitude Noise from the VCO is Ampliﬁed and Can Leak into the Receiver.  an ideal switch. However, in this case any noise on the low-frequency modulating input  which might arise in a digital-to-analog converter  is ampliﬁed and appears at the output. Just as in the case of phase noise, a bistatic conﬁguration will have 15 to 25 dB lower transmit leakage and thus lower amplitude noise in the receiver.  The calculations given above are, of course, very simpliﬁed and not precisely representative of any actual reader, but provide rough guidance for the sort of noise performance that can be achieved by a typical homodyne radio system. By reference to Section 3.6 of Chapter 3, we can see that for a monostatic system with the noise thresholds we’ve given above, the read range of a tag is limited to around 15–20 meters by receiver sensitivity. Current passive tags will run out of power to drive the tag IC before they get this far from the receiver, since as we’ve noted before a passive tag is usually forward-link-limited, but as tag IC’s improve receive sensitivity will become more important. For semipassive tags, the reverse link budget will limit read range, and we can clearly see the beneﬁts of using a bistatic radio in this case; reducing the noise by 20 dB will improve our range by 20 4 = 5 dB = 3X, so that we can expect semipassive tag reads at around 50 meters for an ideal link, and longer ranges  albeit with fading  in a real environment with reﬂections.  4.5 RFID Receivers  RFID receivers face a unique set of requirements, quite distinct from those encountered in most other radio systems, particularly when passive tags are used.  In some respects, RFID receivers are easy to build. Because passive tags require so much forward-link power, there is usually not much point in constructing a receiver at the theoretical  175   Chapter 4  sensitivity limit, because the tags will have lost power to their IC’s by the time they get that far away. The limitations of passive tags also mean that the return link modulation is always some variant of frequency-shift keying, so the demodulation and decoding problems are always relatively simple, compared to more sophisticated radio systems using phase-and-amplitude- keyed signals with error-correcting codes.  On the other hand, RFID receivers face a huge interfering signal or blocker in the form of the transmitted signal leaking into the receiver, either internally within the radio, or from the antenna reﬂections or leakage, as well as external reﬂections from the environment. Since this blocker is at the same RF channel as the tag signal it can’t be ﬁltered out in the RF part of the radio. Further, the interfering signal swings wildly in amplitude during the time when the transmitted signal is modulated to talk to the tags; the receiver needs to recover from the effects of these changes before it can hope to decipher the small tag response. Finally, because  absent Doppler shifts  the received signal and the local oscillator signal are at exactly the same frequency, the absolute phase of the received signal inﬂuences the amplitude of the downconverted signal  Figure 4.18 , so some sort of phase diversity must be provided to ensure visibility of the tag signal.  4.5.1 Receiver Architectures  The basic receiver architecture for an RFID receiver is that of a direct-conversion I Q demodu- lator  Figure 4.59 . The received signal is split and directed to two mixers, one excited with the local oscillator signal and the other with the LO signal shifted by 90 degrees  that is, with cos ωct  and sin ωct  respectively . The received signal is mixed in each branch with the LO signal, and the resulting output is ﬁltered to remove the carrier and harmonics, leaving behind a low-frequency signal containing the tag response.  Recall that the phase of the tag reﬂection is not predictable or controllable, as it varies by each time the distance to the tag changes by λ 2 ≈ 16 cm. If the reﬂected signal ◦ 2π = 360 from the tag is in quadrature with the LO in the I-branch, it produces zero output voltage from the mixer  Figure 4.18 , but in this case the received signal is in phase with the LO signal in the Q branch and produces the maximum possible signal. In the case where the phase of the received signal is in between that of the I and Q LO signals, both branches will generate an intermediate output level. Thus, performance can be expected to vary slightly with range to the tag, but in all cases, a signal ought to be received.  In conventional radio design, the received signal is almost always directed ﬁrst to a band ﬁlter, to remove interfering signals from outside the band of interest  in this case 902–928 MHz in United States operation . In an RFID radio, the band ﬁlter may not be very helpful. Because the sensitivity requirements for a radio for passive tags are not very demanding, rejecting  176   UHF RFID Readers  Figure 4.59: Generic I Q Receiver.  low-amplitude out-of-band interferers is less important than in a conventional radio. Recall that the main mechanism by which interferers cause problems is through third-order distortion  Figure 4.15 ; if mixers with high third-order intercept  Section 4.3.2  are used, the resulting interfering signal amplitude is likely to be too small to concern us in a passive tag receiver. In addition, as we noted previously  Figure 4.35 , commercially-available ﬁlters for the United States ISM band  902–928 MHz  cannot reject the top part of the nearby cellular downlink band  869–894 MHz , so some likely interferers will slip through the ﬁlter in any case. A band ﬁlter may be omitted in a low-cost compact reader design intended only for monostatic operation, but included in a high-cost portal reader designed for bistatic operation.  A conventional radio also uses a low-noise ampliﬁer  LNA  to increase the signal strength prior to the lossy splitter and mixer. In a monostatic RFID receiver, this LNA may cause more harm than good. The large antenna reﬂection entering the receiver may exceed the signal level over which the LNA is able to amplify with good linearity, causing reduced sensitivity for the small tag signal, while the ampliﬁcation provided by the LNA also ampliﬁes the phase and amplitude noise present in the leakage signal  Section 4.4.3 above , providing no advantage in sensitivity when those noise sources dominate the thermal noise of the receiver. Low-noise  177   Chapter 4  ampliﬁers make more sense when used in a bistatic conﬁguration, where the leakage from the transmitter can be kept below 0 dBm.  The architecture of Figure 4.59 is sensible for modulation schemes where a handful of signal edges are expected per symbol, as is the case in FM0 modulation used in the Gen 2 standard  see Chapter 3, Section 3.4 . When the symbol encompasses a large number of edges, it makes more sense to think of it as a shift in frequency, and detect this frequency shift using a ﬁlter discriminator like a classic FM receiver. In this case, the receiver architecture can be modiﬁed slightly, by phase-shifting one of the branches and recombining them to create an image-reject mixer  IRM . The output of the IRM can be shown to be independent of the absolute phase of the received signal, so this design is again insensitive to the exact distance to the tag. The IRM architecture is convenient to use for EPCglobal class 0 tags, which employ an FSK scheme in which the tag modulates its reﬂection at roughly 2 MHz for a binary 0 and 3 MHz for a binary 1.  Figure 4.60: Image-reject Mixer Conﬁguration for Frequency-shift-keyed Tag Signal.  178   UHF RFID Readers  As is apparent from the discussion above, the choice of monostatic or bistatic operation affects radio design and performance. Bistatic radios will generally have superior sensitivity to monostatic radios, but when the forward link budget is the main limitation performance may not be strongly affected by receive sensitivity. A bistatic radio is more expensive because of the doubling of antennas, antenna cables, and antenna connectors, though the cost of a circulator within the radio may be avoided in this case. Bistatic conﬁgurations are impractical for handheld or portable readers, and less convenient than monostatic radios for many ﬁxed applications. Thus the receiver design choices are affected by the overall system architecture, which in turn is determined by the envisioned usage models for the reader.  4.5.2 DC Offsets and Recovery  An RFID receiver for passive tags is generally a homodyne radio: the received signal is at the same carrier frequency as the local oscillator. Any reﬂected signal, such as those from the antenna, stationary objects in the antenna ﬁeld, and internal reﬂections in the radio, is mixed with the LO and contributes a signal at zero frequency—that is, at DC. The DC voltage, or DC offset, generated depends on both the phase and amplitude of the reﬂected signal  see Figure 4.18 . When the transmitter is operating in CW mode, this offset is truly a DC voltage, and as such it can be easily blocked by a series capacitor, which doesn’t allow DC or low- frequency signals to pass  Figure 4.61 .  Figure 4.61: Offset Problems for Direct-conversion RFID Receiver.  179   Chapter 4  However, during the reader-to-tag part of the exchange, the amplitude of the transmitted signal is intentionally modulated to produce the reader symbols. The ‘DC’ voltage will potentially swing over a large range during this time, with the same frequency spectrum of the reader modulation. This large signal may drive ampliﬁers into compression, preventing receipt of the tag signal until they have recovered. Recovery will be slow if we use a large value capacitor for the series block, since it then stores a large amount of charge which must leak out into the circuit before DC conditions are restored. We can choose a small value for the series blocking capacitor and exclude this modulation signal from the receiver, but then if the tag response also has components at low frequency, they will be excluded as well, reducing sensitivity of the receiver.  The timing requirements for the receiver are typically established by the relevant tag protocol. For example, in the EPCglobal Class 1 Generation 2 standard  ISO 18000-6C , the delay between completion of a command and initiation of the tag reply varies with the data rate. For a reader average data rate of about 100 kbps, the tag should respond about 18 microseconds after the reader is ﬁnished transmitting  the requirements being somewhat dependent on the tag data rate as well . When the lowest allowed reader data rate is used, this time is extended to about 75 microseconds. Receiver recovery problems may be invisi- ble at low data rates, but show up as degraded sensitivity when high reader data rates are attempted.  One solution to the receiver recovery problem is to use some sort of adaptive receiver, that changes its conﬁguration depending on whether transmit modulation is active. The simplest approach is to place a series switch in front of the ampliﬁers, and turn the signal off when transmit modulation is on. Alternatively, one can use adaptive ﬁltering that cuts off the low-frequency modulation signal when the transmitter is modulated, and restores it when the modulation is done and the tag signal is to be received.  4.5.3 Phase and Amplitude Noise and Sensitivity  The sensitivity of the receiver is limited by the noise that enters it. As we discussed in some detail in Section 4.4.2 above, the largest source of noise for an RFID receiver is usually the leakage from the transmitted signal, particularly when a monostatic conﬁguration is employed.  As we saw in our previous discussion, the amount of amplitude noise entering the receiver is maximized when the transmitted leakage from the receiver is in phase with the local oscillator signal, and the amount of phase noise converted to amplitude noise in the receiver is maxi- mized when the transmitted leakage is in quadrature with the local oscillator. Since the receiver normally has two branches, I and Q, in quadrature, the dominant noise source in each branch will depend on the relative phase of the local oscillator and the transmitter leakage,  180   UHF RFID Readers  which depends on things like the exact length of the antenna cable and is not usually well-controlled. The conversion of phase noise to amplitude noise is also dependent on the total phase  or delay  associated with the leakage path, since this total phase controls the effect of a change in frequency on the phase relationship between the leakage and the LO. Thus, the importance of phase noise depends on cable lengths and other delays.  Let us imagine, for example, that a long antenna cable is in use, and phase noise from the transmitter is the main noise source entering the receiver. Let us further imagine that the leakage happens to be in phase with the LO at the receiver, so that the I-channel is relatively quiet and the Q-channel relatively noisy  Figure 4.62 . When the tag is in phase with the LO, the signal on the I-channel is strong and encounters little noise. When the tag is moved an ◦ eighth-wavelength farther away, the tag signal will be 90 best signal will be found in the Q-channel, where it must compete with converted phase noise. In this case, we can expect that the receiver sensitivity will vary with tag distance, with a period of 1 4 of a wavelength  about 8 cm for ISM-band operation .  out of phase with the LO, and the  Naturally, there is no particular reason why one channel would be preferred: the phase noise could just as easily be mainly in the I channel. Depending on the exact characteristics of the radio and cabling, the amplitude or phase noise may dominate, or even be of comparable magnitude, so that there would be little distinction between the I and Q branches and the receiver might be insensitive to absolute phase of the tag signal.  4.5.4 Example Design Calculations  To get a feel for how a design is constructed, let’s look at a few examples of design calculations. We’ll start with the question of interference rejection: can we tolerate nearby readers operating when we’re trying to receive?  Let’s imagine there are two other readers, say 5 and 10 m distant from ours, all using 6 dBi antennas and transmitting at 1 W. How much power reaches the receiver from these neighboring transmitters? To arrive at an estimate we use the Friis equation  equation  3.20  . We ﬁnd for the 5-meter distance:   cid:2    cid:3 2 ≈ 0.45 mW  −3.5 dBm   λ 4πr  PRX = PTXGTXGRX   cid:2    cid:3 2  0.33 4πr  =  1  4  4    4.41   The 10-meter-distant transmitter will contribute 6 dB less power, or about −9.5 dBm. In both cases the received power is greatly in excess of the tag signal for tags more than a few cm distant, so if either of these two readers happen to be on our channel we will not be able to read  181   Chapter 4  Figure 4.62: Receive Sensitivity Variation with Tag Signal Phase due to Converted Phase Noise.  tags  unless they are using EPCglobal Generation 2 Dense Interrogator mode; see Chapter 8 . In United States operation, the chance that one of the two readers will hop onto the same channel as our wanted reader is about 1 25. If more potentially interfering readers are present, the chance of co-channel interference increases linearly, and the interfering signal doesn’t fall off very rapidly: a reader 50 m distant will still contribute a received signal of about  182   UHF RFID Readers  −3.5− 20  =− 23.5 dBm. When a large number of readers are present in a conﬁned space it is necessary that the duty cycle be low, or it will become very difﬁcult for any of them to work.  The situation is worse if the readers also radiate some power out of their own channel, as is apparent from e.g. Figure 3.12 of Chapter 3. Let us imagine the 10-meter-distant reader is not on the same channel as ours but instead on an adjacent channel, but that this adjacent channel contains  say  1% of the signal energy in the main channel—that is, the power in the adjacent channel is down by 20 dB. The received power is then  −9.5− 20  =− 29.5 dBm: still enough to block tags more than 1 or 2 m away see equation  3.21  . If the interfering reader is on the next-adjacent channel, the power in the operating channel might be down by as much as 60 dB  this level being compliant with Dense Interrogator operation in the EPCglobal Generation 2 standard, as we shall see in Chapter 8 . In this case the interfering signal is  −9.5− 60  ≈ −70 dBm, and will cause a problem only for tags fairly far from our reader. So while we can have some hope of dealing with interferers two channels away, readers on the adjacent channel to ours will also block our ability to read any but nearby tags. If we consider only next-adjacent channels as non-interfering, we have only 25 non-interfering ‘channels’ to hop to in typical United States operation using 500 kHz channels. With even 3 collocated readers, interference can be expected roughly 8% of the time, and with 25 readers in one facility, reads will be very difﬁcult if all are simultaneously active.  So far we have only considered power radiated into the intended channel due to modulation of the interfering signal. Even if a band ﬁlter is present it cannot reject the other reader signals, which are in band. Recall that non-linearity in our receiver can cause intermodulation products to be generated from signals on other channels  Figure 4.15 . These intermodulation products will fall on our wanted channel whenever two interfering readers are equally-spaced; i.e. if our receiver is tuned to channel 1, and the interferers are on channels 3 and 5, or 8 and 15, etc. The intermodulation signal can be found from the magnitude of the interfering signals, and the third-order intercept of the input low-noise ampliﬁer  if present  or mixer  Figure 4.13 . Guided by the results above, let us estimate that the interfering signals might be around −10 dBm. In order for the third-order distortion products to be less than −70 dBm, we must be backed off by  60 2  =30 dB from the input third-order intercept. Thus, we require an input device with IIP3 = −10 + 30 = 20 dBm or more. Such performance is achievable from commercially-available components, but at relatively high cost.  How much gain do we need after downconversion  that is, after the mixer ? A tag signal entering a monostatic receiver at −65 dBm might encounter  for example  2 dB losses in the circulator and switches, 7 dB conversion loss in the mixer, and 1 dB insertion loss in the carrier-reject ﬁlter. The signal entering the baseband chain would be about −75 dBm. In a printed-circuit radio, this signal may be in a 50 Ω environment, in which case the associated voltage is around 50 μV. An integrated reader  on an IC  is likely to use higher input  183   Chapter 4  impedances in the baseband, resulting in a peak voltage of around 200–400 μV. The amount of gain required to obtain a readable signal depends somewhat on the approach to digital-to- analog conversion, discussed in more detail in the next section. Let us for simplicity assume the ﬁnal stage is a comparator: that is, a device whose output is either a digital high or digital low level, of roughly 1 V. The required voltage gain is then on the order of 3000–20 000, or around 75–85 dB. It is apparent that a few tens of millivolts of transmitter modulation that leaks through to the receiver will readily saturate the receiver, leaving a small tag signal invisible.  4.6 Digital-Analog Conversion and Signal Processing  The general topic of digital signal processing has ﬁlled a number of books, and to cover any substantial portion is far beyond the scope of our discussion here. We shall limit ourselves to a few remarks speciﬁc to RFID.  Because of the modest computational capabilities of passive tags, only relatively simple modulation schemes are used for passive RFID, and data rates are low relative to most other communications technologies. When simple ASK symbols are used, the transmitter can be based on a simple switch  equivalent to a 1-bit digital-to-analog converter , with optional analog ﬁltering to smooth transitions and reduce spectral width. Filtering can also be perfor- med in the digital domain using standard techniques such as ﬁnite-impulse-response ﬁlters  FIR —in this case requiring a more sophisticated DAC with multiple bit resolution. It is important to note that the DAC can then be a source of amplitude noise, and it may be useful to bypass or ﬁx the DAC output during the CW portion of operation, when the receiver is attempting to decipher a possible tag reply.  On the receive side, the optimal approach for signal processing depends on the protocol in use. As we shall see in Chapter 8, the EPCglobal class 0 protocol uses subcarrier-modulated frequency-shift keying, with frequencies of 2.2 or 3.3 MHz, for the tag reply to the reader. The relatively high frequency means that one can use a conventional analog FM discriminator, which produces a simple binary output  either 1 or 0  depending on the tone frequency.  Both outputs may occur if a collision is present.  Recovery of the tag clock is not needed since the locations of individual edges in the tag signal don’t matter.  Other protocols use approaches in which only one or a few edges  abrupt transitions in the amplitude of the backscattered signal  determine whether a symbol is a binary 0 or binary 1. Since tags normally have only two states, in principle it is sufﬁcient to sample the data once for each change in the tag state, and it is only necessary to provide one bit of information: whether the signal is high or low.  184   UHF RFID Readers  For example, EPCglobal Class 1 Generation 2 uses FM0 signaling, in which a symbol with no transition in the middle is a binary 1, and a symbol with a transition in the middle is a binary 0. In this case, it is vital to be able to determine where the boundaries of each symbol are, which is equivalent to synchronizing the reader to the tag’s clock, a task known as clock recovery. Clock recovery can be challenging in passive RFID because the tag clocks are not required to be particularly accurate: symbol rates can vary by 10% or more. Consider a tag reply con- taining a 96-bit electronic product code and 16-bit error check  112 bits : if we obtain synchronization on the ﬁrst few bits but get the clock timing wrong by 10%, by the end of the message our guess at where the symbol edges lie will be 10 symbols in error! Clearly this is not acceptable for accurate decoding.  One approach to solving this problem uses a block-by-block comparison of the received data with the expected symbols. This approach depends on oversampling: the signal is sampled several times per symbol rather than just twice. Fixed blocks of samples are considered, with transition rules that depend on what happened in the previous block. Drift in the clock is implicitly accounted for by these rules, rather than being explicitly applied to vary the sample timing.  For example, let us imagine we extract eight samples of the returned signal amplitude in each nominal symbol time. If the symbol is a binary 1, we expect that all the samples will have the same value  either high or low , whereas if the symbol is a binary 0 the ﬁrst four samples will have one value, and the last four samples the other. In addition, there are transitions at each symbol edge, so we expect a sign change between adjacent blocks of 8 samples. These expectations are illustrated in sample set  a  of Figure 4.63. In this ideal case, it is only necessary to examine whether the ﬁrst four samples in each block of 8 are the same as the last four samples. Symbol edge transitions always occur between the sample blocks and can be ignored.  Life is more complex when the clock drifts. Sample set  b  illustrates a case where the tag clock is slower than the reader clock. Initially the symbol edges are well-aligned with the 8-sample block and the binary-0 transition is centered. However, as time passes, the symbol edge drifts to the right past a sample time and appears within a block, and the binary-0 transition  when present  becomes off center. Multiple signal transitions are present within a single block of 8 samples. In order to distinguish between symbol edges and meaningful code transitions, we now need to remember what happened in the previous block. By imposing the rule that edges can move at most one sample point to the left or right between successive blocks, we can distinguish between symbol edge transitions and coding transitions  assuming that the distinction was properly made to start with! . We must also account for the case where, for example, the coding transition drifts entirely out of the right side of one block and appears at the left side of the next block  aliasing . When such an 8-sample shift is seen, the  185   Chapter 4  Figure 4.63: Sampling FM0 with Tag Clock Drift  block in which it occurs will not contain valid data and is ignored: the putative coding edge has moved to the subsequent block  if present .  When the tag clock is faster than the reader clock  sample set  c  , the edges move slowly to the left. Here, it is possible to have two coding transitions occur in one block of 8 samples, thus producing two bits from a single block. Proceeding in this fashion, only ﬁxed blocks of samples need be examined, and clock drift is corrected by allowing blocks with no valid resulting bits, and blocks with two resulting bits. Approaches of this type are simple to implement with modest computational requirements, but are somewhat sensitive to noise and offsets: we are relying on the analog circuitry to properly establish the average voltage so that high and low samples accurately reﬂect the tag’s backscattered signal.  An alternative approach is to use a sliding correlator  also known as a matched ﬁlter  for each possible symbol of interest, and assign values to successive symbols based on the resulting correlation scores. Correlation approaches are computationally more demanding  though this approach lends itself to implementation in an application-speciﬁc integrated circuit  ASIC  . A correlator can make efﬁcient use of oversampled data to distinguish between valid symbols and noise or offsets.  It is also possible to transform a set of data into the frequency domain using a Fast Fourier Transform  FFT . Once in the frequency domain, we can readily ﬁlter out high-frequency  186   UHF RFID Readers  noise and low-frequency offsets and drifts, and then return to the time domain to extract data bits. This approach is also relatively demanding of computational resources and could beneﬁt from dedicated hardware for FFT’s and other operations.  4.7 Packaging and Power  Modern reader radios are generally fabricated by placing discrete components and integrated circuits onto printed circuit boards, the latter being multilayer composites of copper and polymer that provide wiring for interconnections and ground, and to a lesser extent cooling. The boards are normally packaged within metal housings, which provide the dual beneﬁts of isolating the radio’s components from interferers in the outside world, and isolating the outside world from the radio. Ideally, the only high-frequency emissions from the reader are at the antenna connector ports.  It is often useful and sometimes indispensable to provide additional isolation between regions of each circuit board, or between neighboring circuit boards. In high-performance circuitry mostly used in military applications, each circuit board resides in its own space milled out of a thick aluminum plate, with shielded interconnections between segments. This sort of approach is prohibitively expensive for most commercial equipment; instead, it is more common to apply covers of formed sheet-metal over sensitive regions of a radio’s receiver or synthesizer. Local isolation is also useful to help conﬁne harmonics of the output frequency that may be generated by the power ampliﬁer  see Section 4.3.1 above : a 900 MHz signal, with a wavelength of 33 cm, will not escape very readily from a small hole in the reader housing that is made to allow for a control button or Ethernet connection, but the fourth harmonic at a wavelength of about 8 cm, is much more slippery.  4.8 Capsule Summary  Radio transmitters must be accurate, efﬁcient, and transmit within their allowed frequency band. Receivers must be sensitive  but not to criticism , selective, and detect a huge range of signal strength. Both must be ﬂexible. RFID reader radios usually operate in unlicensed bands and thus must support frequency hopping or other interference-mitigation provisions. RFID readers also have the peculiar problem of being both full- and half-duplex; the use of a bistatic antenna conﬁguration may be beneﬁcial. Because they receive a backscattered signal, RFID receivers are generally conﬁgured as homodyne rather than heterodyne radios. The leakage from the transmitter creates offsets which must be ﬁltered or blocked.  Radios are constructed of a number of key components. Ampliﬁers are characterized by gain, power, bandwidth, noise, and distortion properties, which are often reported in terms of  187   Chapter 4  second- and third-order intercepts. Mixers are more complex, and in addition to conversion loss, bandwidth, noise, and distortion, one must consider isolation and a large number of possible spurious output frequencies.  Oscillators are generally constructed using positive feedback through a resonant circuit. Oscillator amplitude noise can readily be removed by limiting the output; phase noise is not so easily dealt with. The resonator quality factor plays a critical role in determining the phase noise of the oscillator. Oscillators use a variable component such as a varactor to adjust the frequency of oscillation.  An oscillator is generally embedded in a phase-locked loop to form a synthesizer, which produces an output signal bearing a controlled relationship to a very stable reference frequency. Integer-N and fractional-N synthesizers can both be used in RFID applications; fractional-N synthesizers are more versatile but more complex to design and can suffer from additional noise.  Filters remove unwanted frequencies from a signal. Filters built of discrete components are usually limited to quality factors of around 10–20 and thus cannot ﬁlter very narrow bands; other technologies, such as surface-acoustic-wave devices or dielectric resonators, are used to achieve narrowband high-frequency ﬁltering. Once the signal is converted to baseband, ﬁltering can use discrete components or active ﬁlters created by combining an operational ampliﬁer with a frequency-dependent feedback network. The transmitter must be modulated; this may be done with a simple switch, or use a digital-to-analog converter, such as a current-steering circuit. The received signals must at some point be converted from analog voltages to digital data. There are several architectures for performing this operation, including ﬂash and delta-sigma converters.  Monostatic RFID readers also employ specialized microwave components—circulators and directional couplers—that are capable of selecting signals based on their direction of travel.  Transmitter architectures trade efﬁciency, cost, and transmit bandwidth. Filtering of the transmitted symbols greatly improves the spectral width of the output, but even more improvement can be achieved using phase-reversal amplitude-shift keying, which requires a single mixer for implementation, or single-sideband modulation, which requires a quadrature modulator. Power efﬁciency is usually dominated by the output power ampliﬁer design; designers must trade off linearity  and thus transmit bandwidth  against efﬁciency. Phase noise  from the oscillator  and amplitude noise  from the ampliﬁer chain and the DAC  are important because some of the transmitted signal leaks into the receiver and can limit sensitivity. Transmit phase noise is converted to amplitude noise due to the delay-line- discriminator action of the transmitter output, cable, and antenna. The inﬂuence of these  188   UHF RFID Readers  noise sources is dependent on absolute phase and likely to be different on the in-phase and quadrature channels of the receiver.  RFID receivers are generally homodyne architectures with an I-Q direct downconverter driven by the same oscillator that provides the transmitted signal. For protocols that use pure frequency-shift-keyed signals, an image-reject mixer conﬁguration may be used instead of an I-Q converter. Transmit leakage and other reﬂected signals will mix to DC, creating offsets that are easily ﬁltered when unchanging, but problematic when they are modulated at rates similar to those used by the tags. A switch may be used to block the receiver input when the transmitter is modulating. Transmit amplitude and phase leakage will limit sensitivity for monostatic conﬁgurations and may still be a problem for bistatic readers.  Once a received signal is digitized, the whole array of digital signal processing techniques becomes available to decipher it. The receiver must somehow sample the signal properly despite inaccurate and inconstant tag clocks. Very simple schemes employ block comparison on a ﬁxed number of oversampled points; more sophisticated approaches use sliding correlators or Fast Fourier Transforms of the data.  Reader radios are constructed of IC’s and discrete components assembled on composite circuit boards. The package in which the reader is placed protects the components from the outside world, protects the user from the component voltages, and may play an important role in keeping spurious signals conﬁned to achieve regulatory compliance.  4.9 Further Reading  4.9.1 RFIC Design  The Design of CMOS Radio-Frequency Integrated Circuits, Thomas Lee, Cambridge, 1998: An encyclopedic introduction to the design of radio components, though the emphasis is much broader than purely CMOS implementation  which was probably added to the title to increase sales .

When the objects are very expensive, the cost of the tags is of little consequence, but their endurance is of great import, since expensive objects, and our interest in them, are usually also long lived. When the objects are cheap, the tags must be cheaper. These are the fundamental dynamics of tag design.  As a consequence, tags that are intended to label long-lived, expensive objects  typically viewed as assets on someone’s books  are usually active tags, with their own radio transmitter and receiver, powered by a local battery. Since battery technology has progressed very slowly relative to semiconductor technology, the key issues in designing a active tag are to minimize the duty cycle—the proportion of time during which the tag is doing something other than sleeping—and to minimize the power required both to support the active state and the sleep or idle state. While these are not trivial design challenges, the technology used to fabricate an active tag is substantially similar to that used in other radios including the reader radio: dis- crete components and ICs are soldered to a printed circuit board, with the whole attached to a compact antenna and placed within a plastic housing.  Passive tags are mostly meant to identify inexpensive objects, and must thus, submit to an economic asceticism that eschews such luxuries. Conventional batteries are far too bulky and expensive to be considered. A conventional radio transmitter or receiver, with the complex and expensive oscillators, mixers, and synthesizers over which we labored so diligently in Chapter 4, is out of the question. Only inexpensive, low-speed circuitry and simple logic are permitted to us if the tag is to be powered by the pittance of microwatts available at several meters distance from a reader  Chapter 3 . Instead of a proper transmitter, a switch to change the impedance presented to an antenna must sufﬁce. A single IC is usually the only electrical component to be placed on the tag, and thus, this circuit must be a custom design solely for its specialized application. The expense of creating such an application-speciﬁc integrated circuit  ASIC  implies that only large volume usage can provide an economic return to the company responsible for it.  195   Chapter 5  Between these extremes lie semipassive tags, possessed of a battery but bereft of a radio. To date, such tags have typically been constructed for specialized applications with moderate volumes, such as auto tolling, and use fairly conventional fabrication and design approaches, with special attention to duty cycle just as for active tags.  A greatly simpliﬁed diagram of the electrical constituents of a passive tag is depicted in Figure 5.1. The radio signal at around 900 MHz from the reader is converted by the antenna into an alternating current, from which the tag must extract both power and information. The tag must then interpret the resulting data, possibly requiring writing data to nonvolatile memory, and modulate the load presented to the antenna in order to change the backscattered signal returning to the reader.  In what follows, we shall examine a few of the special challenges of designing and manufacturing a passive UHF tag:    How is power to be extracted from the high-frequency radio signal?   How can we simultaneously acquire whatever data the reader has sent?  Figure 5.1: Elements of a Passive UHF Tag.  196     How do we send back information to the reader?   How is the resulting chip designed and fabricated?   How is a completed tag assembled from the chip and other parts?  UHF RFID Tags  5.2 RF to DC  To operate, a tag IC needs not just power, but direct-current  DC  power: a source of voltage that is roughly constant in time, of magnitude from 1 to 3 V depending on the type of tran- sistors used in the circuitry, and capable of supplying a few tens of microamps of current. The tag needs to get this DC power from an incoming RF signal whose polarity changes about 900 million times per second, and with the proviso that at a few meters from the reader, a small tag antenna provides an open-circuit voltage of only about 0.1–0.3 V.  To change alternating  AC  voltages to DC, we need an electrical component that treats positive and negative polarities differently: a diode. The left side of Figure 5.2 shows the idealized version of a diode: a component that allows electrical current to ﬂow only in one direction. The right side of the ﬁgure shows a more realistic view of a diode’s characteristics: in the allowed  forward  direction current turns on slowly until some turn-on voltage is reached, thereafter increasing more rapidly. In the blocked  reverse  direction, a small leakage current ﬂows, increasing as reverse voltage is increased.  Figure 5.2: Diode Schematic Symbol  Left  and Current-voltage Characteristic  Right .  197   Chapter 5  The actual current ﬂow through a diode is exponential in the voltage; a reasonable approximation is:   cid:10    cid:11   I = I0  kT − 1 e qV  ,   5.1    5.2   where I is current, V is voltage, q the charge on an electron, k is Boltzmann’s constant and T the absolute temperature. I0 is a constant characteristic of the particular type of diode in question. The quantity kT q is about 0.026 V at room temperature, so if we increase the applied voltage by 1 V, we increase the current through the diode by:  e1 0.026 ≈ e40 ≈ 2.3· 1017.  That is, the forward current increases very rapidly indeed with voltage. For typical values of current ﬂow, we can treat the current as turning on abruptly at some turn-on voltage Von. Two types of diodes are commonly available in standard IC processing: junction diodes, which −11 cm2 at room temperature, and Schottky have saturation currents I0 around 10 diodes with saturation currents 3–7 orders of magnitude larger, corresponding to a reduction in voltage of about 0.2 to 0.3 V for the same current density.  Schottky diodes are more difﬁcult to fabricate and are not always available, or may increase the processing cost when used.  Rectiﬁcation can also be accomplished using diode-connected transistors, in which the drain is shorted to the gate; in this case, the turn-on voltage is roughly equal to the transistor threshold voltage.  −10 to 10  This idealized version of the current-voltage characteristic is shown in Figure 5.3. The current is zero for all voltages less than the turn-on voltage Von, and can become arbitrarily large when the applied voltage exceeds the turn-on voltage. In this view, the diode acts as an ideal switch with an offset voltage. The offset voltage can be estimated from equation  5.1 , and varies logarithmically  thus rather slowly  with the DC current required.  Armed with this simpliﬁed component model, let us examine the problem of extracting a DC voltage from the RF voltage provided by the antenna to the tag IC. The simplest approach is to place our idealized diode in series with the voltage from the antenna. The result ought to be current ﬂow only in one direction through the diode. We’ll use a capacitor to store the current between RF cycles.  Recall from Chapter 4 that a capacitor is the analog of a spring. The voltage across the capacitor is proportional to the total amount of current that has ﬂowed into it—the stored charge—analogous to the total extension or compression of a physical spring.  We will represent the remainder of the IC by a load resistor, through which current ﬂows from the capacitor and diode. The whole scheme is shown in Figure 5.4.  198   UHF RFID Tags  Figure 5.3: Idealized Diode Current-voltage Characteristic.  Figure 5.4: Simple Rectiﬁer Circuit.  199   Chapter 5  Figure 5.5: Rectiﬁer Circuit in on State  Left  and off State  Right .  Operation of this circuit, treating the diode as an idealized rectiﬁer, is shown in Figure 5.5. When the voltage across the diode is larger than Von, the diode acts like a closed switch, with a voltage offset. A net voltage of  Vpk − Von  appears across the capacitor and resistor, where Vpk is the peak voltage of the signal. During this time, a pulse of current ﬂows into the capacitor to charge it up.  When the voltage on the diode falls below Von, the diode turns off. Current now ﬂows out of the capacitor through the resistor, and the voltage across the resistor decreases. The time required for the capacitor to discharge is equal to the product of the capacitance and resistance, RC. If this time is long compared to the RF cycle time, the supply voltage will be roughly constant during the RF cycle.  Let’s make a simple estimate of the component values required. The RF cycle time is about  1 900 MHz  = 1.1 nanoseconds. Let us assume that the IC consumes about 30 μW from a power supply of 1 V. Since the power dissipated in a resistor is proportional to the square of the voltage and inversely proportional to the resistance, we ﬁnd  P = V 2 R  → 30 × 10  −6 = 1 R  → R = 33.3 kΩ.  To achieve an RC time constant ten times longer than the RF cycle, we need:   5.3    5.4   RC = 33 300· C = 11 × 10 → C = 3.3 × 10  −13 Fd = 0.33 pF.  −9  200   UHF RFID Tags  This is a very modest amount of capacitance, even for an IC implementation. So far, it appears easy to convert incoming RF voltages to DC to power the circuit. However, it isn’t sufﬁcient for the DC power to be constant over a single RF cycle: it is necessary that the tag still be powered even when the RF power is brieﬂy switched off to send data to the tag  see Chapter 3 . For plausible data rates, the power could be off for around 10 microseconds. To achieve this RC time constant, we need a capacitance of:  RC = 33 300· C = 10 × 10 −6 → C = 3 × 10 −10 Fd = 30 pF.   5.5   To achieve a reasonably constant supply voltage over the course of an RF cycle, we naturally need much more storage capacitance: on the order of 300 pF to keep the variation in supply voltage small. This is a substantial amount of capacitance and will require about 40 000 to 60 000 square microns of the IC  whose total area is typically 500 000 to 1 000 000 square microns . In addition to just storing enough charge, we also need to distribute the stored charge over the circuit so that those locations that need power at any given moment have it available; otherwise, one transistor switching on will tend to reduce the power supplied to its neighboring transistors, leading to crosstalk and logic errors.  In addition to the problem of providing enough capacitance, we need to provide the full operating voltage of the IC from the available RF voltage from the antenna. This is also challenging, because by reference to Figure 5.5, we can see that the output voltage of the simple rectiﬁer is not the peak voltage of the input but the difference between the peak voltage and the turn-on voltage of the diode. If the incoming peak voltage is less than the diode turn-on voltage, the diode will never turn on and no power will be delivered to the circuit. Even when the incoming voltage is large enough to get through the diodes, the sacriﬁce of Von is painful: an IC needs 1 or 2 V torun, and the turn-on voltage of a typical diode at the relevant current densities might be around 0.5 V  rather dependent on how much diode area we are willing to devote . All this has to be squeezed out of an antenna that is itself providing only about 0.2 V at a distance of a few meters from the reader antenna. How are we to get enough voltage to run the chip?  The ﬁrst tool we can make use of is reactive matching. The voltage provided by the antenna is associated with a speciﬁc source resistance and reactance; typically, the source resistance varies from a few tens to a few hundred ohms depending on the antenna conﬁguration. The IC draws a few microamps at a volt or two, so the dissipative part of the IC appears as a rather larger resistance  typically 1–10 kΩ . By using inductors or capacitors to match the source and load, we can theoretically gain an increased voltage proportional to the square root of the ratio of these impedances. However, it is not practical to extend this approach  201   Chapter 5  indeﬁnitely. Real matching elements have ﬁnite loss, and a very high Q also results in narrow bandwidth  see Section 4.3.4 of Chapter 4 . For example, let us assume that wish a tag to operate over the whole region of frequencies in use worldwide, that is from 860 to 960 MHz. The relative bandwidth ought to be around  100 900  = 11%, so the matching network should have a quality factor around 1 0.11 = 9 or 10. Therefore, we can achieve an increase of 5- to 10-fold in the antenna voltage using reactive matching.  A very common approach to obtaining higher voltages from a rectiﬁer is the use of a charge pump: a number of diodes connected in series so that the output voltage of the array is increased. The simplest sort of charge pump, a voltage doubler, is shown in Figure 5.6. Two diodes are connected in series, oriented so that forward current must ﬂow from the ground potential to the positive terminal of the output voltage VDD. A capacitor prevents DC current from ﬂowing between the antenna and the diodes, but stores charge and thus, permits high- frequency currents to ﬂow. A second capacitor stores the resulting charge to smooth the output voltage.  When the RF voltage is negative and larger than the turn-on voltage, the ﬁrst diode is on  Figure 5.7 . Current ﬂows from the ground node through the diode, causing charge to accumulate on the input capacitor. At the negative peak, the voltage across the capacitor is  Figure 5.6: Voltage Doubler Schematic.  202   UHF RFID Tags  Figure 5.7: Charge Pump During Negative Part of RF Cycle.  the difference between the negative peak voltage and the voltage on the top of the diode. The output  right  plate of the capacitor is  Vpk − Von  more positive than the RF input. When the RF input becomes positive, the ﬁrst diode turns off and the second  output  diode turns on  Figure 5.8 . The charge that was collected on the input capacitor travels through the output diode to the output capacitor. The peak voltage that can be achieved is found by adding the voltage across the input capacitor, which we found above, to the peak positive RF voltage and subtracting the turn-on voltage of the output diode:  VDD = Vpk +  Vpk − Von − Von = 2 Vpk − Von .   5.6   In the limit where the turn-on voltage can be ignored  e.g. when the input voltage is very large , the output DC voltage is double the peak voltage of the RF signal, from which fact the circuit derives its name. The actual output voltage depends on the amount of current drawn out of the storage capacitor during each cycle, that is on the value of the load resistance  not shown here .  To produce higher output voltages, we can provide additional stages of multiplication to produce a Dickson charge pump. A two-stage conﬁguration is shown in Figure 5.9; in the case of ideal diodes with negligible turn-on voltage, the output would be four times larger than the peak RF input voltage. In general, for N stages we ﬁnd:  VDD = 2N  Vpk − Von .   5.7   203   Chapter 5  Figure 5.8: Charge Pump During Positive Part of RF Cycle.  Figure 5.9: Two-stage Dickson Charge Pump.  204   UHF RFID Tags  It is tempting to imagine that one could continue to add as many stages as required to convert even the most modest input voltage into something adequate to power the IC, but as we add stages, we encounter diminishing returns. A very simple analysis of the problem is shown in Figure 5.10. All the DC current must ﬂow through all the diodes in series, so as we add more stages, we waste more and more power in the turn-on voltage of the diodes:  Pload = VDDIload;  Pdiodes = 2NVonIload.  The power efﬁciency of the charge pump thus decreases as the number of stages increases for a given turn-on voltage and output voltage:  ηcp = Pload Ptotal  =  VDDIload  VDDIload + 2NVonIload  VDD + 2NVon  =  VDD  .   This analysis turns out to be a bit optimistic for the single- and two-stage cases if substrate loss—current ﬂowing into the bulk of the silicon wafer due to the capacitance of the diode to the substrate—is signiﬁcant.   The resulting behavior is shown in Figure 5.11. We can see that the more stages we add  to enable the IC to run with a smaller RF power and thus extend the nominal range , the less efﬁcient the charge pump becomes.   5.8    5.9   Figure 5.10: Charge Pump Output Analysis. The RF Analysis is Shown at the Time When Vertical Diodes are on; the Horizontal Diodes Produce a Different Topology but the Same Result.  205   Chapter 5  Figure 5.11: Power Efﬁciency vs. Number of Charge Pump Stages from Equation  5.9 .  A reasonable approach to estimating the number of stages is to extract an equivalent resistance from the load, given the total power calculated above:  2 Req = Vin 2Ptotal  ,   5.10   where the input voltage is adjusted to produce the requisite load voltage from equation  5.7 . Roughly speaking, the largest resistance that can be matched to the antenna is Q2 times larger than the radiation resistance of the antenna. For a typical dipole-type antenna, this value is 10–50 Ω, so the largest equivalent resistance that can be optimally matched is around 5 kΩ, assuming the limits on matching mentioned above.  Higher values can be used but at some sacriﬁce in bandwidth.  We can thus, adjust the number of stages in the charge pump to provide about the right equivalent resistance for the value of Q we expect to achieve in matching.  206   UHF RFID Tags  Several weaker but non-negligible effects are important in arriving at a ﬁnal design. The area of the diodes has a weak  logarithmic  effect on the turn-on voltage and thus on the efﬁciency, so one is tempted to make the diodes large. However, the diode capacitance grows linearly with the diode area, and since the equivalent resistance of the charge pump is ﬁxed  by the power and voltage targets, as described above , as the diodes are made larger the capacitor starts to draw a substantial reactive current. The capacitance is also voltage dependent  increasing noticeably as the diodes are turned on , and the variation in capacitance degrades the performance of the matching network, particularly for narrowband, high-Q networks. A charge pump with more stages has smaller capacitance variations because the peak voltage across each diode is closer to the turn-on voltage; a typical change for a junction diode is around 25–30% of the zero-bias capacitance. Larger diodes contribute more capacitance but need less peak forward voltage for the same current, so the capacitance variation grows rather more slowly than the capacitance itself. A plausible guideline is that the change in reactance of the equivalent input capacitance be comparable to the equivalent resistance of the load, leading to an input capacitance of around 0.25–0.5 pF for typical parameter values. The exact results are, of course, sensitive to the details of the process technology used.  Even from this rough modeling approach, it is clear that key leverage in operating at higher efﬁciencies and lower power lies in reducing the turn-on voltage of the diodes comprising the charge pump  ideally without excessive increases in diode capacitance , and it can be expected that progress along those lines will continue to improve passive chip performance.  5.3 Getting Started, Getting Data  Once power is available from the charge pump, it is often helpful to reset the state of the logic circuitry. An example of a circuit to send this power-on reset  POR  signal is depicted in Figure 5.12. The circuit has two branches, each with an NMOS and PMOS transistor in series. The gates of the left branch transistors are connected to the drains of the right branch, and vice versa. Recall that an NMOS device turns on when the gate is positive with respect to the source  thus attracting electrons  and a PMOS device turns on when the gate is negative  attracting holes .  For more on transistors, see Appendix 3 . If, for example, the right side gate connection becomes a bit more positive than the source, the NMOS device begins to turn on and the PMOS device becomes more resistive. This causes the voltage on the common drains to become more negative, resulting in the left-hand PMOS device turning on and the left-hand NMOS device turning off. The left-hand drains thus become more positive, enhancing the original displacement. The NOR  not-OR  gate output is high when the inputs are different, so since as this circuit turns on, it rapidly assumes opposite states on the two branches, the NOR gate launches a positive-going pulse to reset the remainder of the circuit  POR .  207   Chapter 5  Figure 5.12: Power-on reset Circuit; After Curty et al.  As we noted in Chapter 3, the signal from an RFID reader is amplitude modulated to convey information to the tags. In order to demodulate the signal, we need to create a baseband voltage whose magnitude is proportional to the peak voltage of the reader signal: the envelope of the RF signal. We have already created a circuit that will do the trick  Figure 5.4 , if we choose a storage capacitance value C that provides a storage time long compared to the RF cycle  around 1.1 nanoseconds  but short compared to the length of the data-carrying modulation pulses  one to several microseconds . If necessary  if the antenna is a DC-open or is capacitively coupled , we may provide a resistor to provide a discharge path for the storage capacitance; the values of the capacitor and resistor are chosen to provide a time constant RC of a few nanoseconds. To provide a larger signal voltage for a given RF peak voltage, we can construct a multistage charge pump like that of Figure 5.9, though again happily the requirements are much less demanding, since we need deliver only enough voltage to allow the subsequent circuitry to distinguish between the RF power-high and RF power-low conditions of the reader signal. It may also be useful to construct a similar circuit with a longer time constant, to extract a voltage corresponding to the average RF power over many symbols. A simple circuit suitable for these purposes is shown in Figure 5.13.  Once we have obtained a low-frequency voltage proportional to the RF power, we need to extract information from it. If the data is, for example, PIE coded, what we need to ﬁgure out  208   UHF RFID Tags  Figure 5.13: Circuit for Extracting RF Envelope and Average Power from Incoming RF Signal; After Curty et al.  Figure 5.14: Simple Demodulation Circuit for Pulse-interval-encoded Data; After Karthaus and Fischer.  is how long the signal remains high between pulses: a long RF-high period represents a binary-1 and a short RF-high period represents a binary-0  see for example Figure 3.7 . One simple approach is shown in Figure 5.14. The output of the envelope-detect circuit is directed to a trigger circuit, with an optional current source or other provisions to set the threshold for the trigger. The trigger thus changes state at the beginning of an RF-on pulse, and resets an integrator, which then starts accumulating charge while the voltage is high. The output of the integrator grows linearly with time as long as a signal is applied to its input; on the next  209   Chapter 5  rising edge of the RF signal, the integrator output is large if the power was high for a long time, or smaller if the RF-high time was short. That output is applied to a discriminator, which then outputs a 1 or 0depending on the duration of the RF-high period, just as desired.  Recall from our discussion of Chapter 4 that a radio receiver typically includes ﬁltering to select the desired channel, and minimize noise and interference from other transmitters. A passive tag has no such luxurious amenities. Since there is no local RF oscillator or mixer, there is no conversion operation to allow for channel ﬁltering: all received signals at any RF frequency are converted to baseband by the charge pump. As we will discuss in somewhat more detail in Chapter 7, the tag antennas provide some frequency selectivity but will generally cover at least the 902–928 MHz ISM band for United States operation. Thus, any transmission in this band, including not only other RFID readers but cordless phones, wireless networks, cell phones and cell basestations, alarm systems, badly grounded spark plug wires, and any other nearby RF radiators all blast right into the IC’s receiver.  5.4 Talking Back  Passive tags use modulation of the power scattered by the tag antenna to reply to the reader. In our earlier discussions of backscatter modulation, we imagined a very simple scheme in which the IC simply interrupts current ﬂow through the antenna to modulate the scattered power  see for example Figure 3.15 . Let’s take a closer look at how one might modulate the behavior of the antenna and what the consequences are. The three questions we need to address are:    How much scattered power can we send back to the reader?   What effect do we have on the power absorbed by the  IC  load?   How hard is it to implement a given scheme?  Let us ﬁrst examine the limiting cases of the loads that can be presented to the antenna. These are shown schematically in Figure 5.15. Note that in this and subsequent diagrams, we show an antenna connected to a ground node, which is deﬁned to be at zero voltage. In practice, most tag antennas are symmetric and there is no easy way to deﬁne a true “zero” voltage, but the principles are the same, and it is much easier to discuss the problem in this single-ended conﬁguration, rather than the actual balanced or differential connection.  In normal operation, we shall assume that the IC is matched to the antenna: that is, the antenna and IC have been adjusted so that the largest possible power is delivered to the IC. We shall momentarily specify in more detail what this implies about the behavior of the system.  210   UHF RFID Tags  Figure 5.15: Elements of Simple Backscatter Modulation Schemes. Single-ended Antenna Connections are Shown for Simplicity.  When an open circuit is presented to the antenna, the path to ground is blocked and no current ﬂows in the antenna; since there is no current ﬂowing, no power is radiated  backscattered  in this state.  Real antennas are not quite so simple and do scatter some power even when they are presented with an open circuit load, and real antenna designs don’t quite correspond to the conﬁguration shown here. We shall defer a discussion of these subtleties to Chapter 7.   When a short circuit is presented to the antenna, current ﬂows readily to ground without encountering any resistance or creating any voltage. It may be inferred that, in this case, a large antenna current ﬂows and substantial scattered power results.  In order to examine the use of these three states for modulation in a quantitative fashion, we need to construct an equivalent circuit for an antenna. We’ll use the very simpliﬁed circuit in Figure 5.16. The antenna is represented by a voltage source Vant, arising from the impinging RF electric ﬁeld from the reader, and a radiation resistance Rrad, so named because it arises not from the electrical resistance of the metal of which the antenna is constructed but from the power lost in the scattered waves that result when current ﬂows in the antenna. The antenna current must ﬂow also through a load consisting of the  constant  load resistance due to the IC’s power supply  the charge pumps we discussed in Sections 5.2 and 5.3 above , with provisions for opening or closing switches to present either an open or a short to the antenna.  The power delivered to the radiation resistance  and thus scattered back into the world  is proportional to the product of the square of the current and the resistance, like any other resistor  see Section 3.2 of Chapter 3 . When the switches are in the default conﬁguration  211   Chapter 5  Figure 5.16: Equivalent Circuit for an Antenna with an IC Load, with Provisions for Switched Modulation of the Load.  shown, the same current must ﬂow through the load resistor. The total current is readily found from Ohm’s law  see Appendix 3 :  iant =  Vant  Rrad + Rload  .   5.11   When the load resistance is very small compared to the radiation resistance, there isn’t much voltage across the load and little power is delivered to the load. When the load resistance is much larger than the radiation resistance, all the voltage appears across the load, but little current ﬂows, so again not much power is delivered to the load. It is easy to show that the optimum power transfer—the matched condition—occurs when the values of the source and load resistance are equal. This is the state to which all our previous calculations of the power available from an antenna  Section 3.5 of Chapter 3  referred. Note that as a consequence, in the matched condition, the power dissipated in the load is equal to the power dissipated in the radiation resistance—that is, a matched antenna scatters as much power as it receives. Let us denote this power Pav, the available power. This is the baseline backscattered signal of the unmodulated, matched antenna. We must now examine how this signal changes when we change the load.  Let us ﬁrst examine the use of an open circuit load for modulation  Figure 5.17 . In order to transmit information back to the reader, we can switch the antenna between state 1, in which the antenna sees the matched load of the IC, and state 2, in which an open circuit is presented to the antenna. As we noted in Chapter 3, typical tag modulation approaches, such as FM0,  212   UHF RFID Tags  Figure 5.17: Modulating the Backscattered Signal by Switching Between a Matched Load and an Open Circuit Load.  switch symmetrically between the possible tag states, so the tag will spend an equal amount of time in state 1 and state 2.  The equivalent signal power is due to the change in current between the modulated and unmodulated states; the peak power is thus equal to the available power, and if the states are equally likely it is on half the time. Therefore the average backscattered signal power is half the available power  The power delivered to the IC during modulation is the average of that in state 1  the normal power  and that in state 2  in which the IC gets no current and so no power :  Another possible approach to modulation is to use a short circuit on the antenna as state 2  Figure 5.18 . In the short circuit condition no power is delivered to the IC, because there is no voltage across it. However, the current in the antenna is doubled relative to the matched case: iant = Vant Rrad. The signal power is again found from the difference in currents, and is:  That is, the modulation is the same as before even though the peak scattered power is larger. The power delivered to the IC is the same as it was in the previous case:   5.12    5.13    5.14    5.15   PBSC = Pav 2  PIC = Pav 2  .  PBSC = Pav 2  PIC = Pav 2  .  213   Chapter 5  Figure 5.18: Modulating the Backscattered Signal by Switching Between a Matched Load and a Short Circuit.  It is obviously possible to obtain a higher backscattered signal power 2Pav by switching between an open circuit and a short circuit—but in this case no power at all is delivered to the IC! Such a conﬁguration can be considered for a semipassive tag.  Note also that in both cases examined above, the IC power is reduced during modulation. This is an important practical problem. In early tag designs, it was not uncommon for a tag to start its reply to a reader and then run out of juice in the middle of transmitting its ID. Since tags may often be found to be forward-link-limited  Section 3.5 of Chapter 3 , it is helpful to consider trading off some backscattered signal for more tag power  though in the real case, the backscattered signal may be lower than the idealized values obtained here; see Chapter 7 . One approach we might consider is to place a resistance in series with the load; we will choose some speciﬁc values so that the total power delivered from the antenna is the same in both modulation states  Figure 5.19 .  The total power delivered to the  load + modulation resistor  by the antenna is the product of the current and the total resistance:   cid:3 2   cid:2   cid:2   Pdel,1 = 1 2 Pdel,2 = 1 2  Vant 3Rrad  Vant   3 2 Rrad   cid:3 2 Rrad  2 Vant 2Rrad = 1 Rrad 9 = 1 9  2  2 Vant Rrad  .   5.16   However, the power delivered to the load resistor  representing the useful power for the IC  is NOT the same:  214   UHF RFID Tags  Figure 5.19: Modulation Using a Resistive Circuit in Place of a Short  Resistive Amplitude-Shift Keying .  The average power delivered to the IC is thus:  which is about 0.5 dB better than our simplistic modulation schemes above. The backscattered power is determined by the difference in the currents:   cid:2   cid:2    cid:3 2 Rrad  cid:3 2 Rrad  2  Vant 3Rrad  Vant   3 2 Rrad  2 Vant = 1 Rrad 36 = 1 9  2  2 Vant Rrad  .  Pload,1 = 1 2 Pload,2 = 1 2  PIC = 2.5 36  2 Vant Rrad   cid:2   ≈ 0.55Pav,  cid:3 2  PBSC = 1 4  Vant   cid:3    cid:2    3 2 Rrad 2 Vant Rrad  1 9  Rrad  − Vant 3Rrad Pav ≈ 0.22Pav,  = 2 9  = 1 4   5.17    5.18    5.19   which is about 3.5 dB worse than in the case of the short or open circuit. So modulating the load resistor doesn’t really seem get us much advantage in power to the IC and gives up some backscattered power.  What about the use of a capacitor instead of a resistor to modulate the load? This change in the reactive properties of the load will result in a change in the phase as well as amplitude of  215   Chapter 5  the current ﬂowing through the antenna, and thus is phase-shift keying of the tag. An example scheme is shown in Figure 5.20. It will be understood that the positive and negative reactances are likely to be implemented by changing the value of a capacitance.  Recall that there is a capacitance in parallel with the resistive load of the IC, which we have presumed to be removed by the matching network.   The computation of the currents and powers is rather more involved in this case, but roughly what is going on is that the capacitance changes the phase of the current without changing the amplitude very much. As a consequence, the power delivered to the load resistor is almost the same as in the unmodulated case, but the backscattered power is substantial. The process is depicted graphically in Figure 5.21. The currents are:  Iant,1 =  Vant  Rrad + jRrad  2  Iant,1 =  Rrad +  Rrad + jRrad Vant −jRrad Rrad − jRrad  2  = Vant Rrad  1 + j 1 + 2j  = Vant Rrad  1− j 1− 2j .  The backscattered signal power is due to the difference between these currents:   cid:12  cid:12  cid:12  cid:12  1 + j   cid:12  cid:12  cid:12  cid:12 2  PBSC = 1 4 = 1 4  Iant,1 − Iant,22 Rrad = 1 4 = 1 4   cid:12  cid:12  cid:12  cid:12 3− j  − 3 + j 5  2 Vant Rrad   cid:12  cid:12  cid:12  cid:12 2  5  V 2 ant Rrad  1 + 2j 2 Vant Rrad  4 25  − 1− j 1− 2j Pav ≈ 0.3Pav.  = 8 25   5.20    5.21   Figure 5.20: Modulation Using Reactance Rather than Resistance.  216   UHF RFID Tags  Figure 5.21: PSK Current Values and Difference, Depicted as Vectors in the Complex Plane.  Current Values Scaled by a Factor of 5 for Clarity.   The voltage across the load can be found by subtracting the voltage across the radiation resistance from the antenna voltage; it has the same magnitude for both states, and is:  and thus, the power dissipated in the load resistor  the IC  is the same in both states:  Vload = Vant  ±j 1± 2j ;  Vload2 = Vant 5  2  ,  PIC = 1 2  2 Vant 5Rrad  2 = Vant 10Rrad  = 0.8Pav.   5.22    5.23   The performance of these variant modulation schemes is summarized in Table 5.1. Clearly, the best compromise between power delivered to the IC and backscattered power is produced by phase-shift keying. The distinctions are on the order of 1–3 dB. For forward-link limited performance, recall that a 2 dBimprovement in power to the IC will only add about 1 dB  10%  to the read range. Similarly, a 3 dBimprovement in backscattered power will only provide about 0.8 dB  8%  improvement in reverse-link-limited range since the backscattered power depends on the fourth power of distance. So the distinctions between these approaches are modest in terms of overall tag performance.  217   Chapter 5  Approach  Match   Open Match   Short  Resistive ASK Reactive PSK  Table 5.1: Modulation Approaches.  Backscattered Power  Pav 2 Pav 2 0.22 Pav 0.32 Pav  IC Power Pav 2 Pav 2 0.55 Pav 0.8 Pav  We have used very speciﬁc examples of ASK and PSK component values for simplicity. In the general case where the component values are allowed to vary from those corresponding to a very small modulated signal to the limit of open and short circuits, it is found that the general conclusions we have arrived at are still applicable: at moderate backscattered power, PSK provides substantially better power delivery to the IC load than ASK, but the backscattered power is always lower than in the extreme case where the load is varied from an open to a short circuit.  It is also worth noting that in the case of the three amplitude-shift-keyed approaches, the power delivered to the load—the rest of the IC—is very dependent on the modulation state, which creates a challenge for the regulation of logic power on the chip, the effect being larger as the modulation efﬁciency increases. If insufﬁcient regulation and storage are provided, these variations may cause logic errors and degrade the ability of the chip to function properly. Power supply stability may need to be traded against backscatter efﬁciency and complexity. The use of PSK has the advantage that power delivery to the chip is almost independent of the modulation state, simplifying power management. On the other hand, the effectiveness of all these modulations in producing backscattered power is dependent on the matching approach and antenna parameters. As we will see in Chapter 7, adding a matching network doesn’t change the qualitative results above, but the matching network has a complex effect on the way the signal is created, so that ASK at the tag can become PSK at the antenna and vice versa.  In order to create any sort of useful modulation, the tag needs some sort of clock to tell it what the difference is between a binary ‘1’ and ‘0’, as well as to synchronize the tag’s logic circuitry. The clock is usually implemented as an oscillator circuit, possibly with some provisions for calibrating the clock speed based on the reader preamble. An example for low-power oscillator circuit is shown in Figure 5.22. The circuit begins to oscillate when the enable connection is pulled high  to positive voltage . Operation of the oscillator assumes the availability of reference voltages for PMOS and NMOS devices that ensure that a certain ﬁxed reference current per micron of gate width ﬂows through transistors biased with the cited voltages. The reference voltages are created by tapping off the gate voltage of similar  218   UHF RFID Tags  Figure 5.22: Tag Oscillator Circuit, After Curty et al.  NMOS and PMOS transistors adjusted in a current-mirror conﬁguration to keep their output current constant.  The circuit alternates between the two states depicted in Figure 5.22. In state  a  the output is high. The capacitor is positive, thus holding T2 off and T3 on. The output voltage is also fed back to T1, which connects the NMOS reference transistor to the negative supply voltage. This reference current discharges the positive voltage stored on capacitor C. When the capacitor voltages falls sufﬁciently, the circuit switches to state  b . T2 turns on and T3 turns off; the output voltage is pulled negative, and fed back to turn T1 off and T4 on. The NMOS reference current terminates, and the PMOS reference current charges the capacitor. Thus, the oscillation frequency is set by the capacitor size, the transistor threshold voltages, and the reference current.  Note that operation of this circuit requires that ﬁve transistors operate in series from the difference between +V and −V. This circuit was designed for implementation in a low-threshold-voltage, silicon-on-insulator  SOI  process. A conventional ﬁeld-effect transistor is manufactured by placing a gate electrode in close proximity to a doped region in a bulk silicon wafer, separated by a thin oxide insulator. The transistor is turned off by  219   Chapter 5  adjusting the voltage on the gate to repel the channel carriers  electrons or holes , but some carriers are able to make their way through the underlying silicon from one side of the transistor to the other, contributing to leakage current. In an SOI process, the channel is constructed on top of an insulating layer, so that leakage current in the off state  subthreshold leakage  is reduced, and devices with very small threshold voltages can be used. The cost of SOI processing is generally higher than that of conventional CMOS. In a standard process, the need to supply ﬁve threshold voltages in series, which requires the availability of a high supply voltage, will likely limit read range, so this circuit might need to be redesigned for conventional implementation.  5.5 Tag IC Overall Design Challenges  Now that we’ve touched on the problems presented by the interface to the physical world, let us turn our attention to the logic, memory, and supporting systems that make the tag responsive to its environment. A rough functional layout of a typical passive tag IC is depicted in Figure 5.23. Around half the chip area is taken up by the logic needed to implement the relevant protocol: about 50 000 transistors for an 18000-6C  EPCglobal Class 1 Generation 2  IC.  We’ve looked at the key RF-related challenges in Sections 5.2–5.4 above. The remainder of the chip operates at baseband frequencies and is generally similar to conventional mixed-signal design. However, there are some special challenges peculiar to the RFID world.  The ﬁrst challenge is, of course, that of cost. The cost of a chip is dominated by its size if yield is reasonably good. Modern IC manufacturing facilities use 200-mm- or 300-mm-diameter wafers. A standard 200-mm-diameter silicon wafer offers a useful area of about 30 000 square millimeters.  This is a bit less than the total surface area: the region within about 3 mm of the wafer edge is usually not useful for processing.  If a single IC has a useful area of around 1 mm2, we can get about 22 000 chips from a wafer assuming that 90% of the chips are good  that is, the yield is 90% . In small volumes, it costs about $1000 to purchase a processed wafer, so the cost of these ICs would be roughly $0.05 per chip. The use of 300-mm wafers increases the initial cost for masks, but in high volume the ongoing cost is reduced by 30–40% vs. 200-mm wafer. The actual numbers are inﬂuenced by such commercial issues as volume pricing—I don’t pay $1000 wafer if I buy several hundred wafers—but it should be apparent that at 1 square millimeter, the chip cost is a substantial fraction of the $0.05 tag cost goal promulgated by such organizations as EPCglobal. It is imperative to keep the chip as small as possible to minimize IC cost.  Traditionally, the size of digital ICs has been strongly inﬂuenced by scaling: the reduction in the size of transistors due to improvements in lithography and processing, which results  220   UHF RFID Tags  Figure 5.23: Functional Layout of a Tag IC  After Stewart .  in a reduction in the size of the chip for the same number of transistors. Technologies are usually named for the smallest feature size used in the process: for example, a typical high-speed fabrication process might make use of an 0.13-μm line to form the transistor gate, and would generally be referred to as an 0.13-μm process. For many years, scaling the size of the transistor down also resulted in reduced power consumption per transistor. However, there are some obstacles to achieving the beneﬁts of scaling in RFID chips over the next several years. First of all, the most advanced process technology is always expensive. It is much cheaper to purchase masks and wafers for 0.18-μm processing than for 0.13-μm processing. Secondly, the beneﬁts of scaling are decreasing as fundamental limits in process technology are reached. For example, silicon dioxide ﬁlms, critical for forming MOS transistors, have reached thicknesses equivalent to only about 3 molecular layers and can’t be reduced much more. Efforts to replace silicon dioxide in this role have so far been unfruitful. Because of leakage through these thin oxide ﬁlms, power consumption in very  221   Chapter 5  small devices is also not as small as one might have expected from extrapolation from older technologies.  A substantial fraction of an RFID IC consists of analog functional blocks: RF rectiﬁers for power supplies, capacitors for energy storage, and circuitry for decoding and modulation. The size of analog blocks doesn’t necessarily change just because the minimum feature size is reduced. For example, the area required for a storage capacitor is set by the total power consumption of all the chip features, so if power consumption doesn’t go down, the capacitor must remain the same size. A diode’s size is set by the parasitic resistance and capacitance associated with it, which determine the frequency it can operate at and the impact it has on the antenna match. A modulation capacitor’s size is set by the characteristics of the antenna and the modulation efﬁciency we seek to achieve. Protection circuitry requirements are determined by the largest voltage the tag expects to see, not by the smallest voltage its transistors could operate at. While in general, the size of the analog blocks can shrink if the power consumption of the logic they support is reduced, analog functions usually don’t scale down in size nearly as readily as the corresponding digital circuitry.  So, we can’t expect scaling alone to magically reduce IC costs. It is also important to exploit every possible measure to reduce size and power consumption of the logic blocks. Automatic routing of wires between transistors is fast and convenient, but clever human designers can squeeze space out of the design by  laborious  manual optimization. Power consumption in the logic circuitry can be reduced by operating the devices near the threshold voltage  the minimum voltage to turn the transistors on , but threshold voltage differs from one chip to another due to variations in manufacturing and due to temperature variations in operation. It is possible to use onboard nonvolatile storage to adapt the operation of each chip to its conditions. Such threshold adjustment techniques may also allow the use of MOSFETs instead of junction diodes or expensive Schottky diodes for rectiﬁcation.  Finally, a tag IC has a number of logic blocks, all running from a very high-impedance antenna  that is, an antenna that has a hard time supplying much current . Each time a logic gate switches its state, a transient current ﬂows from the local power supply connection. If the local supply voltage ﬂuctuates as a consequence—that is, if decoupling is insufﬁcient— the change could be interpreted by a nearby gate as a logical input, leading to errors in operation of the circuit. The challenge of properly isolating the individual gates and the segments of the circuit, is much larger than in conventional circuit design, where power at a reasonably ﬁxed voltage is available from a battery or power supply.  5.6 Packaging: No Small Matter  So far we’ve focused on the electrical guts of a passive tag, but the physical construction is also of great importance. The IC must be connected either to an intermediate strap or the  222   UHF RFID Tags  substrate itself, the latter formed of plastic or paper, at the same time making electrical contact to a separately created antenna structure. At this stage, the tag is often called an inlay. The inlay can be used on its own, either as is or coated with adhesive to be attached to an object. Alternatively, the inlay can be laminated between sheets of paper or plastic to form a smart label or a smart card. These alternative fates are depicted in Figure 5.24.  As a consequence, the overall manufacturing process for a typical smart label containing a passive tag looks something like that depicted in Figure 5.25. In the remainder of this section, we will brieﬂy examine each of these steps.  More has been written about silicon CMOS fabrication than is prudent to contemplate, and we shall not attempt to recapitulate such an extensive ﬁeld in this brief aside. We shall content ourselves with reemphasizing the role of IC size in determining IC cost: the total cost of a completed wafer is roughly independent of what is on it, so the smaller an IC chip is, the  Figure 5.24: Components of a Tag and Inlay or Smart Label Final Forms.  Figure 5.25: Smart-label Manufacturing Process.  223   Chapter 5  more you get per wafer as long as most of them work. High yield of good devices is also very helpful in minimizing test costs. If a large percentage of chips fails, it is necessary to test carefully at the beginning of the process to minimize the labor and materials wasted on bad devices, whereas if only an occasional failure is encountered, testing can be postponed to the end, reducing total cost. Yield is inﬂuenced by a plethora of factors, including process design and equipment maintenance in the wafer fabrication facility, and thoughtful design practices.  Historically, a completed IC connects to the outside world by providing square pads 100 microns or so on a side at the edges of the chip. The chip is placed in a plastic or ceramic package, and electrical connections are made by wire bonding: one end of a gold or  cid:4  cid:4    in diameter is bonded to the IC pad using aluminum wire around 25 microns  0.001 ultrasonic excitation to scrub away surface layers and the other end to a similar contact pad on the package. Wire bonding is highly automated, fast, and reliable. However, it is intrinsically a serial process, with each bond made in sequence, and thus, relatively expensive when the target is a $0.01 chip.  Fortunately, an alternative means of connecting ICs to the outside world is available. This approach, variously known as ﬂip-chip or chip-scale packaging, involves the formation of thick metal bumps on top of the contact pads on the IC. The chip is inverted, and the bumps are placed onto corresponding conducting regions in a package, strap, or tag antenna.  Much early work in this area was performed by IBM and made use of evaporated lead and tin ◦ C, and has to create conventional solder bumps.  Solder, a tin-lead alloy, melts at around 220 historically been widely used for wiring and interconnections, although concerns about the environmental impact of lead have resulted in increasing use of lead-free alloys.  Solder can also be electroplated. The solder-bumped chip is placed over an array of plated or freshly cleaned copper pads and heated to melt the solder, which then forms a ball  Figure 5.26 . The molten solder balls wet the exposed plating or copper surface, and surface tension draws the chip into the proper alignment with the pads. Many alternative metal systems can also be used for forming bumps, including both fusible bumps—bumps that melt at low temperature, like solder—and nonfusible bumps. Non fusible bumps can be formed, for example, using electroless nickel plating followed by electroless gold plating.  Electroless plating solutions exploit local chemical reactions to cause metal to deposit onto an exposed conducting surface from the solution and can be used to selectively deposit metals onto conductive regions while leaving insulating regions untouched. A completed IC chip can be passivated with an insulator, leaving only the bond pads exposed, and then immersed in plating solution; bumps will form only where the bond pads are, avoiding the need for a separate masking step like that used in evaporative solder deﬁnition.   Melting bumps requires high temperatures, which may exceed the tolerance of the inexpensive plastics used for passive tag assembly. A popular alternative is to use non fusible  224   UHF RFID Tags  Figure 5.26: Cross-sectional View of Solder Bump After Reﬂow; Ball Diameter Typically 100–200 microns.  bumps and conductive pastes, typically fabricated by mixing ﬁne metal particles, often of highly conductive silver, with a polymer binder, typically an epoxy resin. It is possible to replace the metal bumps with conductive paste, applied by screen printing, or to use conductive pastes to make contact between bumps and the antenna or strap pads. A perhaps more useful approach is to use metal bumps in conjunction with anisotropic conductive adhesives  ACAs   Figure 5.27 . An ACA is a conductive polymer with carefully adjusted proportions of metal and binder so that the material is conductive when compressed but not in its default state. If a layer of ACA is placed between a bumped chip and contact pads and the chip pressed against the adhesive during cure, the compressed regions under the bumps will become conductive and the remainder of the adhesive will be insulating, forming a self aligned conductive contact to the underlying pads. Such a scheme avoids the need to accurately align the bumps, conductive paste, and pads. ACAs are used in ﬂat-panel display assembly for the same reason. Isotropic conductive adhesives are less expensive and may use lower cure temperatures, but require more accurate assembly, and are more likely to be used in attaching the strap to the inlay, where alignment tolerances are less crucial.  Because tag ICs must be physically small, separating them becomes an important issue. Large ICs, such as microprocessors or memory chips, are separated from their parent wafer using a saw with a narrow blade to slice the wafer up into rectangular blocks, each containing a chip. Kerf loss, the amount of silicon removed by a conventional wafer saw, is around  225   Chapter 5  Figure 5.27: Assembly to Flexible Substrate Using Plated Non fusible Bumps and Anisotropic Conductive Adhesive  Not to Scale .  100 microns. This is equivalent to expanding the chip on all sides by half of the saw kerf: a 1× 1 mm chip becomes a 1.1× 1.1 mm chip, with an area of 1.2 mm2: a 20% increase in the cost of the chip. Kerf loss can be reduced if the wafer is reduced in thickness, typically by grinding the back side, before the individual dice are separated.  Alternative processes for die separation can also be considered. Chips made of gallium arsenide and other compound semiconductors are often separated by scribing: a diamond-tipped stylus cuts a linear notch between each row or column of chips, and then the wafer is bent or stretched slightly to cause it to break along the scribed lines. This process works extremely well for small ICs on these materials, because they are more delicate than silicon, and also break readily in certain directions  known as cleavage planes . Scribe and break can also be used for silicon devices, but silicon is much stronger than gallium arsenide or indium phosphide, and thinning the wafers is indispensable to achieve good separation. Scribing also tends to cause mechanical damage and particle problems.  Another alternative is to use a corrosive liquid to etch the material between the ICs away. Etching produces smooth surfaces and no mechanical damage but requires some sort of mask to protect the ICs themselves from the etchant: an additional step with additional labor and materials costs. Etching solutions can be either isotropic  etching at an equal rate in all  226   UHF RFID Tags  directions  or anisotropic  etching most rapidly in certain directions with respect to the underlying silicon crystal lattice . The kerf loss due to an isotropic etch used for die separation is about twice the thickness of the material being etched since the etchant proceeds sideways at the same rate it proceeds downwards, so again it is useful to thin the wafers before attempting to separate the dice. Anisotropic etchants reveal speciﬁc crystal planes and may allow a more efﬁcient use of the wafer area, but are usually slower than isotropic etches.  Once the individual ICs are separated, they may be assembled onto an intermediate strap prior to attachment to the inlay. In this fashion, the relatively high-precision strap attach can be done in a specialized facility, and the lower-precision strap-to-tag attach, which is unique to each tag design, can be performed separately, using isotropic conductive adhesives and standard assembly techniques.  Alien Technology has pioneered the use of ﬂuidic self assembly to place large numbers of chips precisely onto their straps. Because the chips are not handled mechanically, the kerf between chips is limited by the separation process only and can be as small as 20 microns using anisotropic etching of a thinned wafer. The separated chips are released into a ﬂuid carrier from which they self locate onto precision-etched openings in an intermediate support structure, a strap web. The conﬁguration of the chips and openings ensures that the chips lie right-side-up. The chip-support structure is then laminated, and openings are cut in the  Figure 5.28: IC Attached to Strap in Preparation for Mounting on Antenna.  227   Chapter 5  laminate to permit contact using a printed conductive material. The resulting conductive straps can couple to a nearby antenna to permit non contact preliminary testing of the parts before assembly. Other vendors use more conventional assembly techniques using automated pick-and-place equipment.  Once the chip is placed on a strap, it must be assembled to make an inlay. The inlay is usually constructed from plastic; a common material polyethylene terepthalate  PET . PET is an inexpensive, mechanically robust plastic with good resistance to most common chemicals and low dielectric constant  which we’ll see in Chapter 7 helps in antenna design . It is widely used in textiles, capacitors, recording tapes, and other applications. Polyimides are also used.  An antenna must be constructed on the inlay. The standard means for producing patterned conductive materials on plastics, taken from the printed circuit technology in wide use in nearly all electronic products, involves electroplating a thin copper layer onto the plastic, and then applying a mask to protect the regions where the metal is to remain and removing the undesired copper with a liquid etchant. This type of subtractive-etching process is mature and robust and produces ﬁlms with excellent conductivity. Copper thicknesses of 10–40 microns are readily achieved, corresponding to sheet resistances of less than 1 mΩ square.  Sheet resistance is the resistance of a square piece of a thin material with contacts made to two opposite sides of the square. It is independent of the size and depends only on the material and thickness, and is numerically equal to the resistivity of the ﬁlm divided by its thickness. The resistance of a line may be estimated by multiplying the sheet resistance by the aspect ratio of the line; for example, a line 5 cm long and 1 mm wide has an aspect ratio of 50, and using material with a sheet resistance of 1 mΩ square would have a DC resistance of 50 mΩ.  Metal may also be patterned by stamping—that is, cutting the requisite pattern out of a foil with a sharp-edged tool—and adhering to the plastic.  A signiﬁcantly simpler and less expensive approach is to use a conductive paste to form the antenna. In order to get good performance, high conductivity materials must be used. Modern conductive inks, made using silver particles embedded in a specialized polymer matrix, achieve bulk resistivity of 30–60 μΩ-cm, about 10 times higher than solid silver or copper but acceptable for tag applications. Corresponding sheet resistances are around 12–20 mΩ square. A typical tag antenna segment with an aspect ratio of 20 will thus add a DC resistance of around 0.4 Ω, negligible for most antenna designs. Surface roughness is also important since at UHF frequencies, most of the electrical current ﬂows in a layer a few microns thick near the surface of the ﬁlm. Recent ﬁlms have shown improved surface roughness and better RF performance. Challenges for conductive ink assembly include susceptibility to corrosion and oxidation and problems achieving reliable attachment of the IC.  228   UHF RFID Tags  Whichever approach is used, it is necessary to use high-speed volume manufacturing techniques to minimize cost. The inlays are generally fabricated on long continuous rolls of plastic, using specialized high-speed patterning and assembly equipment.  Once the IC or strap is assembled onto the inlay antenna structure, polymer coatings may be applied to protect the IC and antenna. If the inlay is to be used on its own, it may receive an adhesive coating on the backside and be laminated onto a paper backing. Inlays are also often laminated into a conventional paper or plastic adhesive-backed label; this process is often known as label conversion, with a smart label being the result. Such labels are usable in specialized printers that both print the human-readable printed labeling and write and verify the ID of the encapsulated tag. The resulting labels may be automatically applied using a label applicator, or applied by hand.  Inlays incorporated into labels or rolls must be able to tolerate bending, rolling, and compression during the printing and application processes, as well as electrostatic discharge resulting removal of protective layers for adhesive application, and from general handling.

However, there are unquestionably alternatives to fabricating a UHF RFID tag using a silicon IC at its heart.  The most extensively explored of these approaches is the surface acoustic wave  SAW  tag. You may recall that we have already brieﬂy introduced SAW devices in connection with ﬁltering RF signals  see Chapter 4, Section 4.3.4 . In such a device, an electrical signal  from the antenna  is converted into a sound wave, using a set of periodic metal electrodes known collectively as an interdigitated transducer  IDT , constructed on a thin slice of a piezoelectric material such as quartz or lithium niobate. The sound wave propagates much more slowly than the speed of light, so at UHF frequencies wavelengths are a few tens of microns, making it straightforward to construct arrays of electrodes spaced at integer half-wavelengths. Once the wave is launched away from the transducer, it travels away to the far end of the slice, not terribly interesting by itself. However, if we place an additional electrode along the propagation path, the acoustic properties of the near-surface region are slightly modiﬁed, and a portion of the wave will be reﬂected, just as a water wave can be partially reﬂected by an object ﬂoating on the surface of the water  Figure 5.30 . When the reﬂected wave reaches the IDT, it creates a small voltage in the antenna, and thus, launches a tiny delayed scattered pulse. By adjusting the pattern of these electrodes, a coded message can be sent, containing  for example  the unique ID of the SAW tag.  In order to detect the delay in the pulse, the reader signal must typically be time dependent. The reader may transmit a pulse, or a signal whose frequency increases or decreases with  Figure 5.30: Tag Using a Surface-acoustic-wave  SAW  Active Element.  230   UHF RFID Tags  time  a chirped signal  may be used. Let’s examine the case where a pulse is used. The length of the SAW chip  which, just like a silicon IC, has an important inﬂuence on its cost of manufacture  is determined by the time delay it must support: the longer the chip, the more time it takes for the sound wave to get to the end and the more room there is for adding reﬂectors. The number of reﬂectors is determined by the requirement that they be separated in time by something comparable to a pulse width: if a pulse is  say  100 nanoseconds long, successive reﬂectors ought to be separated by a distance that takes around 100 nanoseconds for the sound wave to cross. The more reﬂectors we have, the more data we can store on the chip. So short pulses are best.  If we build a chip with a round-trip delay of 1 microsecond, and use 100 nanoseconds pulses, there is room for roughly 10 reﬂector electrodes  perhaps, fewer since we may need to use one to mark the beginning of the pulse train ; if each electrode position encodes 1 bit through an electrode being present or absent there, we have a 10-bit ID, hardly adequate for most applications. To get to a full 96-bit ID with 16-bit error check, we need a delay of 11 microseconds. For a typical sound velocity of around 4000 meters per second, the round-trip delay of 11 microseconds corresponds to a chip length of 2.2 cm—substantially larger than the Si IC sizes discussed in the previous Section. In SAW tags, the size of the ID space is directly traded against the size  and thus cost  of the chip.  To mitigate the situation, we can use shorter pulses or encode more bits in each pulse. The problem with shorter pulses is that short pulses use bandwidth. Recall that in Chapter 3, Section 3.3, we noted that the faster the modulation, the more bandwidth is used. To produce a pulse that lasts 100 nanosecond, we need around 10 MHz of bandwidth. But the amount of bandwidth is limited by regulation: in the United States, only 28 MHz is available in the 902–928 MHz ISM band, and much less is available in other jurisdictions. To get better performance, it makes more sense to operate at 2.4 GHz, where about 80 MHz is available for unlicensed use in the United States and tens of MHz in most other areas of the world. To encode more bits per reﬂector, we can use pulse-position modulation, in which we try to resolve small displacements in time of the successive reﬂections. A more powerful but more complex approach is to detect not only the amplitude and timing of a reﬂected pulse but also the relative phase of the RF signal. Phase detection is equivalent to detecting the location of the reﬂector to within a fraction of an RF cycle. At 4000 m s, one 2.4-GHz RF cycle is equivalent to 1.7 microns, so by using phase detection, we acquire a very high-resolution view of the electrode position, at the cost of a very stringent requirement on the position of each electrode on the chip.  The great advantage of a SAW tag is that there is no logic to power on the tag chip, so the read range is limited by the reverse link budget only. The mature techniques of pulsed radar design can be applied to the reader, providing good sensitivity in the presence of  231   Chapter 5  high-amplitude pulses. Long reverse-link-limited read ranges can be obtained. SAW tags can be placed close to metal objects or aqueous ﬂuids  conditions where, as we will discuss in more detail in Chapter 7, the available electric ﬁeld from the reader is reduced  and still be read because there is no requirement for a minimum power at the tag.  On the other hand, SAW tags have no logical capabilities and can only reply with a stereotyped pulse string. All intelligence must be incorporated into the reader. The lack of responsiveness becomes a challenge when multiple tags are present in the region being examined by the reader. Since the tags can’t receive and interpret instructions, all will respond, generally leading to an incomprehensible collision between the tag responses. Various approaches to solving the collision problem are available: the reader can take the strongest tag ﬁrst, decipher the signal  if there aren’t too many others , and then subtract that signal from the whole and go after the next strongest. Directional antennas can be used to limit the physical region being interrogated, as we will discuss in more detail in Chapter 6; this approach requires use of 2.4 GHz or higher frequencies, as highly directional antennas at 900 MHz are quite large and unlikely to be practical for indoor use. Tags can be designed with built-in ﬁxed delays, so that they respond at different times and don’t overlap, but this approach sacriﬁces code space and thus, raises tag cost for the same number of bits of information. Combinations of all these approaches are also possible. It is apparent that when only a few tags are present, collisions will be readily dealt with by a combination of the techniques above with appropriate procedures, but that if tens or hundreds of tags are to be read, an IC-based approach is likely to be superior.  A second alternative to which we shall devote some brief consideration is the use of organic materials to construct an electronic circuit. Semiconductor devices, upon which all silicon ICs are based, exploit the fact that silicon  and certain other materials  can exhibit substantial electrical conductivity when a pure sample is doped with an appropriate alloying element. These dopants either contribute an electron to the crystal lattice or extract an electron from it  leaving behind a positively charged hole ; the two kinds of dopants are known as n-type and p-type, respectively. The free electrons and holes that are created by the dopants can move through the silicon, allowing electric currents to ﬂow, and can be reversibly driven away from some regions of the material through the use of electric ﬁelds, allowing a voltage to control a current ﬂow, and thus, enabling the operation of transistors. To make an IC rather than just a transistor requires the additional capability to fabricate basic electrical components: wires, resistors, capacitors, and  less often  inductors. Since the invention of the transistor in 1947, and more signiﬁcantly of the planar IC in the early 1960s, hundreds of billions of dollars have been invested in the technology to design, fabricate, test, and use silicon IC. Any alternative technology must surmount the very substantial competitive obstacles presented by the need to functionally replicate this vast infrastructure.  232   UHF RFID Tags  The idea of replacing the silicon IC  and possibly the antenna as well  in an RFID tag by conductive organic materials is of interest because of the belief that such an approach will eventually enable the use of very high volume, very low cost processes such as printing and lamination to create RFID tags. Most plastics are insulators, being made of exclusively covalent bonds; but it has long been known that organic materials can provide substantial electrical conductivity when structures encouraging the formation of delocalized electron states are used; graphite  pure carbon organized in a planar structure  is the archetypal example. Graphite is, however, mechanically awkward, and a poor choice for wiring or circuitry. Polymeric materials with unsaturated or delocalized bonding are more plausible candidates for materials with substantial electrical conductivity and the desirable properties of plastics. Organic conductors have been under active development since the 1960s.  Certainly a great deal of progress has been made in organic conductors since the current author laboriously grew miniscule crystals of TTF-TCNQ  the stylish candidate of that ancient day  for his undergraduate thesis. Modern materials, such as vacuum-evaporated pentacene  a block of ﬁve hexagonal benzene rings sewn together at the edge, for those who care  display electron mobility—the response of an electron to an imposed electric ﬁeld—of 1 to 10 cm2 V second, much less than achieved in bulk silicon  where mobilities in the hundreds are the norm  but quite comparable to the performance of amorphous silicon materials that have seen wide commercial use in active-matrix ﬂat panel displays. Doping is difﬁcult but possible. Transistors can be fabricated using inkjet printing or spin casting techniques, though vacuum sublimation produces better material properties. Working tags at LF  125 kHz  have been demonstrated, though at the time of this writing it appears that only certain components of a 13.56 MHz tag have been constructed. Rectiﬁcation  needed to generate power for the IC–see Section 5.2 of this chapter  has been demonstrated at up to a few 10s of MHz but not at UHF frequencies.  There are very substantial obstacles to commercial deployment of these techniques. Operating voltages are typically 10–20 V, much higher than the 1 to 3 V used in silicon ICs. To achieve even such voltages requires that feature sizes around 3 microns be resolved in the structure. Such resolution, roughly equivalent to 8500 dots per inch, is much ﬁner than that normally achieved in low-cost printing processes. The electrical properties of the polymers used today are often unstable in use and on extended exposure to air. The best semiconductor layers are formed by vacuum techniques at a rate of around 0.1 molecular layer per second, not conducive to high throughput or low cost.  Reliable production equipment and processes must be developed for high volume fabrication, a very considerable investment if quantities of hundreds of millions to billions of tags are envisioned.  233   Chapter 5   cid:4  cid:4    cid:4  cid:4  × 12  Even if all these technical hurdles are overcome, challenging economic hurdles remain. At the time of this writing, a 512 MB DRAM chip costs around $6, which is equivalent to around 11 nanodollars  !  per bit or very roughly 0.25 nanodollar per printed ‘dot’, the actual value varying somewhat depending on the memory structure used. A tabloid printed in  47 × 31 cm  paper at 200 dpi  8 dots mm  costs around moderate volume on 18 $0.20 copy, resulting in a cost of 3 nanodollars dot. Larger-volume printing costs are about 10 times lower, or 0.3 nanodollars dot. That is, the cost of conventional printing with inks whose basic formulation is centuries old is if anything more expensive per feature than the cost of modern silicon IC fabrication. It is very unlikely that the exotic materials using in making a low-voltage printed organic IC would achieve these cost levels in the near term. Printing an IC only seems cheap if we assume that the IC complexity is comparable to the complexity of printing a bar code. When we include the magnitude of the actual task to be undertaken if organic circuitry is to provide functionality comparable to its silicon counterpart, it is no longer very clear that printing offers a substantial cost advantage.  Some work has also been done in identifying objects using conductive materials or ﬁbers with no circuitry whatsoever, relying on the frequency-dependent behavior of radio reﬂection from these antenna-like strands to distinguish one object from another. Such an approach promises a very low cost for the ‘tag’ structures, since they contain no circuitry of any kind. However, a sophisticated reading device using millimeter-wave frequencies  >10 GHz  is needed, and since the ‘tags’ have no logic capabilities, usage models are constrained. At these high frequencies, diffraction is much reduced compared to the 900 MHz band, and the advantages of non line-of-sight operation are lessened. Such circuit-less tag technologies may ﬁnd special niches where their very low ongoing cost makes up for complexity in implementation. Non RF-based techniques for authentication, using chemical compounds with unique optical or other analytical signatures, are also used and may have advantages over RFID in this type of application, though such approaches hardly seem adaptable to unique item serialization.  5.8 Capsule Summary  Passive tags harvest power from an incident RF signal using diodes arranged to form a charge pump. Multiple stages help boost the output voltage to the level needed to power an IC, but a practical limit exists to the extent to which circuitry can be used to compensate for low peak voltages received from the antenna. Multiple stage charge pumps are rather inefﬁcient, converting less than half of the received RF power to useful DC power for the remainder of the tag circuitry. A similar rectiﬁer or charge-pump conﬁguration with a faster response is used to extract the amplitude envelope of the reader signal, wherein can be found the commands and data from the reader.  234   UHF RFID Tags  Tags talk back using backscatter modulation. There is an inevitable tradeoff between the extent to which the scattered power is modulated and the amount of power retained to run the tag. The best balance between these competing alternatives is obtained by changing not the resistance attached to the tag antenna but the capacitance. Backscatter efﬁciency of –3 dB can in principle be obtained with modest effects on the tag power supply  but actual results depend on the provisions for matching tag antenna to IC load .  While the logical processing required by a typical protocol is modest compared to modern processor capabilities, design of tag ICs is unusually challenging due to the intersection of two stringent constraints: very low cost and marginal power. Careful attention to individual aspects of the design, including hand routing and analog simulation, is required.  A tag is more than just the IC. Assembly of the tag combines an IC, strap if used, ant- enna, substrate, and optionally label. Assembly is usually based on forming contact structures  bumps  on the IC to mate to contacts on the strap or antenna. Printed or etched metal antennas have historically dominated, but antenna fabrication via printed conductive inks shows promise for UHF applications. The IC, strap, antenna, and substrate form an inlay, which may be laminated into a printable and thus human-readable label to be used.  5.9 Further Reading  5.9.1 Tag IC Design  “Design and Optimization of Passive UHF RFID Systems”, J.

We also introduced several properties of antennas that bear on their utility in an RFID system:    Gain and radiation pattern: the extent to which the power radiated from an antenna  is concentrated in some directions in preference to others;    Effective aperture: the equivalent area from which a receiving antenna collects  energy;  Polarization: the orientation of the electric ﬁeld radiated by the antenna.  There are three other key parameters that we got to ignore when thinking about link budgets, but which become very important when we need to hook a reader to an antenna:  Impedance: how much voltage is required to cause a given current to ﬂow in the antenna?    Bandwidth: over what frequency range does the impedance remain reasonably  constant?  Size and cost: what we give away to get small and cheap.           In this chapter, we’ll look at how we get the gain and polarization we want, and how antenna impedance and bandwidth must be traded against antenna size. Armed with these funda- mentals, we can examine the requirements for different reader applications and see how they map to preferred antenna types. We will touch upon how antennas affect implementation: how to ensure that the beam covers the tags, what polarizations and orientations to use, and some- thing about the specialized connectors and cables used at UHF and microwave frequencies.  241   Chapter 6  6.2 Current Events: Fundamentals of Antenna Operation  Let us ﬁrst brieﬂy review the discussion of Chapter 3 and tie down a few deﬁnitions more precisely. Antennas radiate different amounts of power in different directions relative to the antenna structure. The ratio of the power density, which we’ll call U, in any given direction to that averaged over all directions is the directive gain of the antenna in that direction. The directive gain in the direction in which the power density is largest is called the maximum directive gain or directivity. The efﬁciency is the percentage of the power delivered to the antenna that actually gets radiated as opposed to being absorbed or reﬂected; for most reader antennas, this quantity is close to 100%, so there is little distinction between the directivity and the product of directivity and efﬁciency, the power gain or just gain of the antenna. Formally:  Dmax = U  θmax,φmax  U sin θ dθdφ   cid:2   cid:2   ; G = εDmax ≈ Dmax.  θ,φ  For antennas where a well-deﬁned beam exists, we can estimate the solid angle of the beam as:  and the beam width of a fairly symmetrical beam as:  Ωbeam  steradians  ≈ 4π Dmax  ,  θbeam  radians  ≈   cid:4   4π Dmax  .   Recall that a radian is 180 π ≈ 57 ◦ wires connected at the center to a signal source.  .  The archetypal simple antenna, the dipole, is a pair of  The effective aperture of the antenna, the area over which it collects power from an incoming signal, is also proportional to the antenna gain. The received power is proportional to the power density at the receiving antenna multiplied by the effective aperture, so a high-gain transmitting antenna is also a good receiver. In RFID, the forward-link-limited range  the distance at which the tag receives enough power to operate  is proportional to the square root of the reader antenna gain, as is the reverse-link-limited range.  The effective isotropic radiated power, EIRP, is the power that would need to be transmitted equally in all directions to provide the same power density U as a real antenna does in the direction of maximum gain. Thus:  EIRP = PTX dBm  + GTX dBi .   6.4   242   6.1    6.2    6.3    Reader Antennas  Antennas radiate electric ﬁelds, which point in a speciﬁc direction at each location in space and each moment in time. The behavior of this direction deﬁnes the polarization of the radiated wave. The electric ﬁeld of a linearly polarized wave always points in one direction  vertically, for example  at all times and places. The electric ﬁeld due to a circularly polarized wave rotates around the axis of propagation each RF cycle at any point along the wave. Intermediate cases  elliptically polarized waves  are also possible.  In the remainder of this discussion, we’ll take a somewhat closer look at how antenna con- ﬁguration inﬂuences gain and polarization and also estimate the impedance and bandwidth of an antenna, which determine over what frequency range it can be used.  6.2.1 Got Gain?  A dipole induces a voltage on another antenna located perpendicular to its axis, but no voltage along the axis. What about intermediate cases? It can be shown that the voltage depends on the sine of θ, the angle between the receiving antenna and the axis of the transmitting antenna. It should also be apparent that the dipole transmitter is symmetric around its axis, so the radiation must also be symmetric around the axis. Thus, the dependence of the received signal on the relative location of the receiving antenna—the radiation pattern—of a dipole can be depicted as in Figure 6.1.  Figure 6.1: Radiation Pattern of Ideal Dipole.  243   Chapter 6  The maximum directivity of this pattern—the ratio of the power density in the best direction to the average over all directions—varies from about 1.5 for very short dipoles to about 1.7 for a dipole half a wavelength long  16 cm at 900 MHz . Recall from Chapter 3 that the received power at the tag is directly proportional to the gain of the reader antenna, and that the received power at the reader is proportional to the square of the reader antenna gain: to get longer range, it is helpful to have more gain than a dipole can provide. How do we make the antenna pattern more directive? One possible approach is to use more antennas. For example, let’s consider the scheme shown in Figure 6.2: two ideal dipole antennas side by side. In the real world, we need to worry about these antennas affecting each other, but for simplicity, here we’re going to just assume that the antennas are just the same together as they were alone, so each one has an identical sinusoidal current inducing a vector and scalar potential; the total voltage on a receiving antenna is due to the sum of the voltages from the two antennas. What happens?  Recall that the two individual dipoles transmit the same intensity to all directions in the plane of the paper  Figure 6.1 . However, the pair of dipoles does not because the signals must be  Figure 6.2: Dipole Pair Transmitting to a Distant Receiving Antenna. Left: Receiver Perpendicular to Plane of Array. Right: Receiver Offset with Respect to Plane of Array.  244   Reader Antennas  added together, and as the angle of view changes, the distance from the receiving antenna to each dipole changes. This difference means that the signals from the two transmitting antennas arrive with different time delays at the receiver, or equivalently that they are not at the same phase.  To ﬁnd the effect of this phase difference, we need to write an expression for the voltage. We can write the voltage due to a wave traveling away from a single antenna as:   cid:2    cid:3   ,  V  r  = V0 r  cos  ω t− 2π λ  r  where λ is the wavelength and ω = 2πf is the angular frequency.  We can verify that this represents a traveling wave: when the time increases by some small increment δ, the ﬁrst term in the cosine increases by 2πf δ. If at the same time the distance increases by f δλ, the argument of the cosine will stay the same. That is, the wave is moving at a velocity = distance time = fλ, but since the wavelength is the speed of light divided by the frequency, λ = c f, the velocity of the traveling wave is just the velocity of light, c.  When two antennas are present, we can write the total voltage as the sum of the two voltages. For large distances r, the difference in distance to the two antennas is insigniﬁcant, and the effect of the 1 r term can be absorbed into the amplitude, as can the effects of absolute distance and time, so that we are only concerned with the difference between the signals from the left and right antennas. Taking into account, the change in phase resulting from the different path length traveled from the two antennas  Figure 6.2 , we obtain:  V  r  = Vleft + Vright   cid:2    cid:2    cid:3  cid:3   = Vright  1 + cos  sin φ   .  2πd λ  When the angle φ is 0, the voltages just add to give twice the voltage of one dipole  and thus four times the power since power goes as the square of the voltage . However, when the argument of the cosine is equal to π radians, the second term becomes −1, and the voltage induced is 0:  2πd λ  sin φ  =π :  for V  r  =V right  1 + cos π   = Vright  1− 1  =0.  Since the sine is at most equal to 1, a zero value can only happen if  d λ  > 1 2. When two antennas are present, the induced voltage on receiver—the radiation pattern in the plane—is  245   6.5    6.6    6.7    Chapter 6  dependent on angle instead of being uniform, but the exact result depends strongly on the spacing between the two antennas, as shown in Figure 6.3.  When spacing is small compared to a half-wavelength, the radiation is not much different from that of an isolated dipole  left side of the ﬁgure . When the spacing is a half- wavelength, radiation is directed into a relatively narrow slice in the plane  though the radiation pattern is vertically broad . Further increase in spacing gives a very narrow beam in the forward and reverse directions but also creates another beam along the axis of the array.  The peak value of gain in this conﬁguration actually occurs at a separation of about 3λ 4 and is about 6.5 dBi.   Gain or directivity do not by themselves tell us everything about an antenna radiation pattern. The gain of both patterns in the right side of Figure 6.3 is about the same  roughly 5 dBi , but the shape of the patterns is very different. One cannot use gain alone to compare antennas unless they are of a similar type with generally similar patterns.  The origin of directive behavior in this simple two-element antenna array is characteristic of all antennas, though the details vary greatly depending on the design: the difference in power radiated at two neighboring directions depends on the change in relative phase of the  Figure 6.3: Radiation Pattern for a Pair of Ideal Dipoles Separated by Various Distances.

This change in relative phase arises because of the difference in position  perpendicular to the axis of observation  of the different radiating parts of the antenna. Size is a necessary, though not sufﬁcient, requirement for a directional antenna. A large antenna may or may not have high gain, but a small—compared to a half-wavelength—antenna can’t. Furthermore, because gain is proportional to size and beamwidth is inversely proportional to gain  Chapter 3 , we can infer that an asymmetric antenna—one that is, for example, much taller than it is long—will produce an asymmetric pattern, in this case, wide horizontally and narrow vertically.  The patterns that result from a simple two-element array provide substantially higher directivity than we can obtain from a single dipole—but they are still rather inconveniently symmetrical. For example, let us imagine that we construct a simple array from two dipoles spaced a half-wavelength apart and excited in phase, as shown by the dotted line in Figure 6.3. If we orient this array so that one dipole is to our right and the other to our left, and we read a tag, we can be conﬁdent that the tag is either in front of us or behind us—but we don’t know which  unless we are standing in the way of one of the beams! . The two- element array produces a narrow but symmetric pair of beams. In practical applications, we’d often like to produce a single beam that helps us address only the region of interest and avoid reading tags in other places. How can we do this?  One simple approach is to put a nice big fat piece of metal behind the array as a reﬂector  Figure 6.4 . This will work best if the spacing between the array and the reﬂector is correctly chosen. If the array is 1 4 of a wave from the reﬂector, the incident waves from the array will strike the reﬂector  where they suffer an inversion of phase upon reﬂection  and return to the location of the array delayed by half a cycle and phase inverted by half a cycle: the net result is that the reﬂected wave is in phase with that from the array and adds to it, at least along the direction of the beam. In the other direction, the reﬂector  if it is big enough  substantially blocks the beam. We obtain roughly a 3-dB increase in gain from removing the backwards-directed beam, and an antenna where most of the transmitted power is concentrated in a single beam, helping to clearly locate the read zone. A much larger beneﬁt can be had if a parabolic reﬂector is used instead of a ﬂat plate, though this is obviously more complex.  We can generally conclude that a plausible approach to constructing a 5- to 10-dBi, single-beam antenna requires a radiating element on the order of half-wavelength in each direction, and a reﬂector or other element in the direction of desired propagation, to select one beam and reject others. The most common large reader antenna, the patch or panel antenna, generally follows this prescription, though the reﬂecting ground plane is placed much closer than a quarter-wavelength to the metal patch.  247   Chapter 6  Figure 6.4: Two-element Array with a Reﬂector Spaced 1 4 Wavelength Away; in the Forward Beam Direction, the Direct and Reﬂected Waves Add in Phase.  Recall that in the case where the antenna radiates mostly in a single well-deﬁned beam, one can deﬁne a useful beam width θ that is simply if approximately related to the gain G  equation  6.3  . For example, a gain of 6 dBi  a factor of 4  produces a beam about 1.8 radians or 100 degrees; the similar ﬁgure for a 10 dBi antenna is about 65 degrees. Real antennas don’t have sharp-edged beams, and one has to decide where to measure the beam width; a common choice is the angle at which the power density has decreased by a factor of 2  3 dB  from the maximum value in the center of the beam.  As we discussed in Chapter 3, tags are often forward-link-limited. The region around an antenna in which tags can be read—the read zone—is the region in which the incident power exceeds the minimum needed to operate the tag IC. An antenna with a single, more or less symmetrical beam will have a generally ellipsoidal read zone: the range is longest along the center of the beam and falls off towards the edges, and objects displaced by the same distance from the beam will subtend an increasing angle as the distance to the antenna is reduced. A rough estimate of the shape of the read zone can be obtained using the beam widths corres- ponding to  for example  3 dB and 6 dB decreases in power; these beam widths may be obtained from the antenna pattern and might also be documented in the data sheet. The procedure simply assumes that the read range is forward-link-limited and power-limited so that it scales as the square root of the received power; an example is shown in Figure 6.5. The actual read zone will be inﬂuenced by the antenna’s sidelobes if present and by reﬂections from objects in and near the work area.  248   Reader Antennas  Figure 6.5: Idealized Read Zone Estimate.  To construct still more directive antennas, we need larger structures, as well as very precise control of relative phase. There are various approaches to antennas with >10 dBi gain, including parabolic reﬂector antennas, Yagi-Uda arrays, patch antenna arrays, and lens antennas. Since in most applications, RFID readers are unlicensed and limited by regulation to modest antenna gains, these more exotic forms need not trouble us for the present.  6.2.2 Polarization  Currents create vector potentials in the same direction as the current ﬂow. The resulting electric ﬁeld is constructed from the part of the vector potential that is perpendicular to the direction of propagation. A simple antenna like a dipole, which has current ﬂowing only in one direction, creates a linearly polarized radiated wave with the polarization direction being the long axis of the dipole. A similar dipole oriented along that ﬁeld will receive the maximum possible signal; a simple dipole oriented perpendicular to the ﬁeld will receive no signal at all  Figure 6.7 .  As we have noted previously, many tag antennas are long and thin and behave rather like a dipole; this means that a tag oriented perpendicular to the electric ﬁeld of a linearly polarized reader antenna will receive no voltage and will not be read. One possible solution is to vary  249   Chapter 6  Figure 6.6: The Electric Field is Proportional to the Part of the Vector Potential that is Perpendicular to the Direction of Propagation.  Figure 6.7: No Voltage is Induced on a Receiving Antenna Orthogonal to the Electric Field.  250   Reader Antennas  the direction of the electric ﬁeld with time. If this is done on the same time scale as the RF cycle, we obtain a circularly polarized wave, in which the electric ﬁeld rotates as a function of time  Figure 3.32, reproduced for convenience below as Figure 6.8 . As long as the tag antenna is aligned perpendicular to the direction of propagation, the electric ﬁeld and the tag antenna will be parallel at two times during the RF cycle.  There are many ways to produce a circularly polarized wave. One method is to excite two orthogonal antennas a quarter-wave out of phase  Figure 6.9 . Along the direction perpendicular to both antennas, a circularly polarized wave is created, as shown in the top of the ﬁgure. However, we know that a dipole does not radiate along its axis. When viewed from the top or the side, only one of the two dipoles contributes to the received signal, and the polarization is linear. The polarization of the wave radiated by an antenna can depend on the direction of propagation relative to the antenna. While the detailed effect of angle on polarization varies with antenna design, this statement is generally true for circularly polarized antennas. If the antenna has high gain and a single symmetrical beam, we probably don’t care too much: at high angles where the polarization is strongly affected, there isn’t much signal power left. However, in some applications, it is useful to use antennas with a  Figure 6.8: In a Circularly Polarized Radiated Wave the Direction of the Electric Field Rotates One Full Turn in Each RF Cycle.  251   Chapter 6  Figure 6.9: Crossed Dipoles Excited in Quadrature  90 Degrees Out of Phase  Produce Circular Polarization in the Mutually Orthogonal Direction but Linear Polarization Along Either Axis.  This Physical Arrangement is Sometimes Known as a Turnstile Antenna.   narrow beam in one direction and a wide beam in the orthogonal direction, sometimes known as fan beam antennas; in this case, we must attend to the variation in polarization across the beam.  We should note that it is also possible to achieve the same effects, from the point of view of an RFID reader, by varying the polarization on a much longer time scale: we simply switch between a horizontally polarized and a second collocated vertically polarized antenna. To be useful in most RFID protocols, one would need to make the switch in the pause between inventory operations—a time period that could be as short as a couple of milliseconds or as long as hundreds of milliseconds, depending on the protocol, setup, and tag responses. The disadvantage of sporadic coverage that results from this alternating-polarization approach must be weighed against the beneﬁt of placing all the instantaneous power in one polarization at any given time, which provides superior read range for single-dipole tags.  252   Reader Antennas  Figure 6.10: Deﬁnition of E- and H-plane Orientation for a Dipole Antenna.  A bit of notational convention is also convenient to introduce at this point. The radiation pattern of an antenna is often depicted on planar cross-sections. The planes are sometimes named relative to the viewer—elevation and azimuth, or vertical and horizontal—but it is also common practice to call the plane in which the electric ﬁeld lies the E-plane and the orthogonal plane the H-plane. A dipole pattern in the E-plane is a donut like that of Figure 6.1; the H-plane pattern is a circle since the radiated power is symmetric about the axis. In cases where the orientation of the radiated electric ﬁeld is readily determined, such as a dipole, no ambiguity is created. With more complex antenna structures, it can be harder to see where the E-plane ought to be, and circularly polarized antennas don’t have a unique electric ﬁeld plane.  An interesting issue arises for RFID when a bistatic antenna conﬁguration is combined with circular polarization. Recall from Chapter 4 that bistatic conﬁgurations enjoy much reduced transmit leakage into the receiver, at the cost of the use of two antennas for one read location. If a circularly polarized transmit antenna is used to illuminate a single-dipole antenna, the induced currents in the tag will ﬂow along the axis of the tag antenna, and the backscattered signal will be linearly polarized. Any linear orientation will in general be received by a circularly polarized receiving antenna. However, some tags  known as dual-dipole tags—see Chapter 7, Section 7.3.6  have two orthogonally oriented antennas. The current in these antennas will be excited 90 degrees out of phase by an incident circularly polarized wave,  253   Chapter 6  and thus, the backscattered wave will be circularly polarized but of opposite sense.  The electric ﬁeld is still rotating in the same direction as the transmitted wave—clockwise or counterclockwise, as the case may be—but the direction of propagation is reversed. Thus, from the point of view of an observer looking along the direction the radiation is traveling, the sense of rotation has reversed.  The receiving antenna should then be of the opposite sense from the transmitting antenna to get the best signal. That is, if a right-hand-circular transmitter is used, a left-hand-circular receiving antenna should be chosen. A monostatic circularly polarized antenna may have reduced reverse-link sensitivity for dual-dipole tags.  6.2.3 Impedance and Bandwidth  An antenna simultaneously stores charge  capacitance , opposes changes in current  inductance , and radiates power into the wide world  resistance . From the electrical point of view, an antenna looks like an R-L-C circuit. The conﬁguration of the circuit depends on the antenna type. In Figure 6.11, we show two different antennas with their equivalent circuits. The top image is a dipole with a bit of feed line. A dipole that is short compared to the wavelength looks like a series combination of an inductor and capacitor with some resistance. The inductance and capacitance are both roughly proportional to the length of the dipole; at very low frequencies, the inductance has little effect and the capacitance stores  Figure 6.11: Antenna Equivalent Circuits.  a : Dipole Antenna;  b  Patch Antenna.  254   Reader Antennas  little charge, so the dipole looks like an open circuit. As frequency increases, the inductive reactance increases and the capacitive reactance decreases; at some resonant frequency, they are equal in magnitude and opposite in sign and neutralize each other, so that the antenna looks electrically like a pure resistance.  The bottom image depicts a patch antenna—a structure about which we shall have more to say in a moment—as an example of an antenna that requires a parallel rather than series resonant circuit. In this case, the parallel combination of an inductor and capacitor draws no net current at resonance, so again the antenna looks like a pure resistance.  It is important to note that these simple equivalent circuits with ﬁxed component values are only valid over narrow frequency ranges. In particular, the resistance value is due to losses to radiating waves. For dipoles short compared to a wavelength, the radiation from the dipole is roughly proportional to the square of the dipole length. Short antennas have very small radiation resistances. At resonance  which turns out to correspond to a length just less than half a wavelength , a dipole radiation resistance is around 60–70 Ω  slightly dependent on the wire diameter . In contrast, a dipole that is only 1 10 of a wavelength long will have a radiation resistance of about 2 Ω.  To get good power transfer between a resistive electrical source and a resistive load, the source and load resistances should be equal: the source and load impedances should be matched. The feed line is often a 50-ohm cable; in this case, we’d like the antenna to look like a 50-ohm resistor. A dipole at resonance isn’t a bad approximation: a pure resistance of about 65 Ω. No special measures are needed to match the source and load  one of the beneﬁts of a resonant dipole . However, an antenna that only works at one frequency isn’t very useful. A reader antenna operating in the United States must at least operate over the ISM band, 902–928 MHz; it would be even better if the same antenna could be used for all the bands in use throughout the world, from about 860–960 MHz. The frequency range over which an antenna remains well matched to the source is the antenna bandwidth. We shall use our simpliﬁed equivalent circuit to estimate the bandwidth of an antenna.  We shall use complex impedances; the reader to whom these are not familiar may wish to refer to Appendix 3.   The impedance of a series L-C-R circuit is the sum of the impedance of the inductor, jωL, the capacitor, 1 jωC, and the resistor R:  Zant = jωLant + 1  + Rrad,  jωCant   6.8   where we have denoted the resistance with a subscript rad, on the assumption that it arises from radiation. At resonance, the two reactances cancel exactly but away from resonance,  255   Chapter 6  they don’t. The change in impedance per hertz near resonance is just proportional to the inductive reactance:  Zant ≈ 2 j  ω− ωres  Lant + Rrad.  The magnitude of the current ﬂowing for a ﬁxed source voltage is the voltage divided by the magnitude of the impedance:  Iant = VZant ≈  V  2j ω− ωres Lant + Rrad  cid:5  cid:5  cid:5 4 ω− ωres 2L 2  ant + R 2 rad  V   cid:5  cid:5  cid:5  .  =  When the ﬁrst term  in ωL  is small compared to the second  in R , the current is about what it would have been at resonance; when the ﬁrst term is large compared to the second, the current is much smaller than at resonance. The edges of the band can be sensibly deﬁned as those frequency displacements where the two terms are equal:  4 ωedge − ωres 2L2  ant  = R2 rad  →  ωedge − ωres  = Rrad 2Lant  ,  and the bandwidth is twice as large:  2[ωedge − ωres]  ωres  = Rrad ωresLant  = 1 Q  ; BW  GHz  = Rrad 2πLant  ,  where the quality factor Q was deﬁned in Chapter 4, and the bandwidth is in GHz if the inductance is in nH and the resistance in ohms. We can see that to get a large bandwidth, we want a large value of radiation resistance and a small inductance. Note that the calculation for the parallel resonant circuit  part  b  of Figure 6.11  proceeds in exactly the same fashion, except that admittances are substituted for impedances  Y = 1 Z . In this case, it becomes convenient to use the capacitance instead of the inductance, and we obtain:  where the bandwidth is in GHz if the capacitance is measured in pF and the resistance in kΩ.  BW  GHz  =  1  2πCantRrad  ,  256   6.9    6.10    6.11    6.12    6.13    Reader Antennas  Figure 6.12: Equivalent Circuits for Dipoles. Top: Resonant Dipole  λ 2  at 900 MHz; Bottom: Small Dipole  λ 8 .  What are reasonable values for a dipole? An approximate equivalent circuit for a resonant dipole at around 900 MHz is shown in the top of Figure 6.12. Substituting the appropriate values into equation  6.12 , we obtain:  BW  GHz  ≈ 65 2π 60   ≈ 0.17 = 170 MHz,   6.14   which is an ample bandwidth to cover the whole region of interest for international use  860–960 MHz .  The bottom of the ﬁgure provides the corresponding equivalent circuit for a much shorter dipole, the sort of antenna one might be tempted to use for a handheld reader. The inductance and capacitance have been scaled by a factor of 4, but note that the radiation resistance has fallen by much more than that! This is because the radiating length has been scaled by a factor of 4, so the radiated potential and electric ﬁeld are reduced by 4 times, but the power  which goes as the square of the ﬁeld  is reduced by a factor of 16. This short dipole is also no longer resonant at 915 MHz: at this frequency, the antenna series inductance has little effect, and the antenna looks capacitive. To match it to a resistive source, we need to add more inductance—that is, we use a matching element. The circuit  257   Chapter 6  Figure 6.13: A Short Dipole Requires a Matching Element.  ends up looking like Figure 6.13. The combined circuit looks like a pure resistance  in this case, 5 Ω . The bandwidth is:  BW  GHz  ≈  5  2π 227 + 15   ≈ 0.003 ≡ 3 MHz.   6.15   This is seriously inadequate for the United States ISM band  26-MHz wide ! The narrow 3-MHz bandwidth is sufﬁcient for operation in, for example, the European RFID band at 865–868 MHz, but as you can imagine, any tiny change in the antenna properties that shifts the resonant frequency will result in poor antenna performance.  A  reader + cable  doesn’t behave like a voltage source but instead looks more a source with a ﬁnite output impedance  typically close to that of the cable, say 50 Ω . In Figure 6.14, we show an estimate of the radiated power vs. frequency, assuming that the reader acts like a ﬁxed voltage  chosen to provided 1 watt to a matched resistive load  and a source impedance equal to the radiation resistance.  We have here ignored the additional problem of transforming the source impedance from 50 to 5 Ω, which represents still another opportunity to narrow the bandwidth of the overall system.  Both dipoles radiate 1 watt when matched, but the resonant dipole is much more tolerant of variations in frequency than the small dipole!  While the details vary considerably from one antenna to another, this example provides good guidance in general: simple resonant antennas provide good bandwidth for typical  258   Reader Antennas  Figure 6.14: Radiated Power vs. Frequency for Resonant Dipole and Matched Short Dipole.  RFID applications, but if we try to make more compact antennas, for example, portable applications, bandwidth and robustness suffer, sometimes dramatically.  When one wishes to actually characterize an antenna, it’s quite a bit easier to measure the power that is reﬂected from the antenna, rather than the power that is transmitted by it. For most reader antennas, we can assume that any power that didn’t get reﬂected was transmitted to the wide world, so if the reﬂections are small, power is being efﬁciently radiated. The magnitude of the reﬂected signal relative to the incident signal is known as the return loss, and should be less than −10 dB. This quantity is readily measured with a calibrated network analyzer, a commonly available if specialized microwave instrument. Good antennas maintain −15 to −20 dB return loss across the band of interest. It is difﬁcult to achieve return loss better than −25 dB consistently: the reﬂected power is so small that it becomes quite sensitive to reﬂections from objects near the antenna and other nonideal conditions. The reﬂected power is also sometimes reported in terms of the voltage standing-wave ratio  VSWR , which is the ratio of the largest power to the smallest power when measured by a probe moving along a transmission line carrying power to the antenna.  The basis for standing-wave measurements is historical: in the early history of microwave technology, before network analyzers were readily available, probes inserted in slotted waveguides were  259   Chapter 6  used to measure reﬂected power.  When no reﬂected wave is present, the same power is measured everywhere along the line, and VSWR = 1. When a reﬂected wave is present, the transmitted and reﬂected waves interfere, creating maxima and minima of power separated by a quarter of a wavelength. A return loss of −10 dB corresponds to a VSWR of about 2:1, and −20 dB to about 1.2:1.  6.2.4 The Patch Antenna  A very popular antenna for RFID reader applications is the patch or panel antenna  Figure 6.15 . A patch antenna gains its name from the fact that it basically consists of a metal patch suspended over a ground plane. The assembly is usually contained in a plastic radome, which protects the structure from damage  as well as concealing its essential simplicity . Patch antennas are simple to fabricate and easy to modify and customize.  The simplest patch antenna uses a half-wavelength-long patch and a larger ground plane.  Large ground planes give better performance but of course make the antenna bigger. It isn’t uncommon for the ground plane to be only modestly larger than the active patch.  The current ﬂow is along the direction of the feed wire, so the vector potential and thus, the electric ﬁeld follow the current, as shown by the arrow in the Figure labeled E. A simple patch antenna of this type radiates a linearly polarized wave.  The gain of a patch antenna can be very roughly estimated as follows. Since the length of the patch, half a wavelength, is about the same as the length of a resonant dipole, we get about 2 dB of gain from the directivity relative to the vertical axis of the patch. If the patch is square, the pattern in the horizontal plane will be directional, somewhat as if the patch  Figure 6.15: Patch Antenna, Shown with Plastic Radome  left  and with Radome Removed to Expose Patch  right .  260   Reader Antennas  were a pair of dipoles separated by a half-wave, as in Figure 6.3: this counts for about another 2–3 dB. Finally, the addition of the ground plane cuts off most or all radiation behind the antenna, reducing the average power over all angles by a factor of 2  and thus, increasing the gain by 3 dB . Adding this all up, we get about 7–8 dB for a square patch, in good agreement with more sophisticated approaches  see Balanis, p. 841, in Further Reading for more details . A typical radiation pattern for a linearly polarized patch antenna is shown in Figure 6.16. The ﬁgure shows a cross section in a horizontal plane; the pattern in the vertical plane is similar though not identical. The scale is logarithmic, so  for example  the ◦ power radiated at 180 ◦ in the center of the beam. The beam width is about 65 that in the United States, the maximum legal power for a reader using this antenna is 1 2 watt, to remain within legal limits for radiated power density.   to the left of the beam center  is about 15 dB less than the power  and the gain is about 9 dBi.  Note   90  ◦  Figure 6.16: Radiation Pattern in the Horizontal  H-  Plane for a Typical Commercial Patch Antenna Speciﬁed for 890- to 960-MHz Operation. Antenna Orientation is Shown in the Inset.  261   Chapter 6  ◦  The beam width is rather close to that we obtained for the horizontal plane with a simple two-dipole array  see Figure 6.3 : the directivity in this plane arises essentially from the fact that the roughly square patch is about half a wavelength wide. An inﬁnitely large ground plane would prevent any radiation towards the back of the antenna  angles from 180 to 360 direction is only about 20 dB down from that in the main beam. This means the forward- link-limited read range will be about 10 times less backwards than forwards: if you can read a tag 5 m from the front of the antenna, you will also read a tag 50 cm behind it—so don’t put them there!   , but the real antenna has a fairly small ground plane, and the power in the backwards  What bandwidth can we expect from a patch antenna, and what inﬂuences bandwidth and impedance? To address this question, we need to consider the currents and charges in the antenna. Currents ﬂowing on the patch induce currents in the opposite direction in the ground plane  Figure 6.17 .  To be precise, the currents on the ground plane are equivalent to an image of the patch displaced below the ground plane by the same distance the physical patch is above it.  The radiation from these oppositely directed currents nearly cancels; what radiation does result occurs only because of the slight difference in time delay  equivalent to phase  from the two plates. To compensate for this near-cancellation, we use a resonant  half-wave  patch, which supports very large peak currents in the patch from only a small current ﬂow in the feed wire.  Figure 6.17: a  Schematic Depiction of Patch Antenna; b  Approximately Opposite Currents Flow on the Patch and Ground Plane, Inducing Opposing Charges on the Plates.  262   Reader Antennas  The equivalent circuit of a patch antenna near its resonant frequency is shown in Figure 6.11: a parallel inductor, capacitor, and resistor. In order to say something about the bandwidth performance of this sort of antenna, we need to put some values on the equivalent circuit elements. The radiation resistance can be estimated from the radiated power and is about 130–160 Ω for a typical square patch  half a wave in both directions . The radiation resistance seen in the center of the patch is actually quite small  1–2 Ω for reasonable geometries, which would be very difﬁcult to work with ; this small value is transformed by the patch acting as a transmission line to provide a convenient resistance when the patch is fed at or near its edge. Since the radiation resistance isn’t terribly close to 50 Ω, a bit of matching is needed; this is often accomplished by displacing the feed point of the antenna away from the edge a bit, as shown in the ﬁgure.  To estimate the bandwidth of a patch antenna, we need some idea of the equivalent capacitance to plug into equation  6.13 . A wild guess using the charge distribution shown in Figure 6.17 b  would suggest that a feed near the end of the patch sees about 1 3 of the parallel-plate capacitance; we can justify this estimate a bit more formally by equating the impedance of the equivalent circuit to the impedance of the transmission line formed by the patch:   cid:4   Lant Cant  = Zline ≈ Z0  d W  ,  where the value for the line impedance is an approximation value when d << W , as is usually the case for a patch antenna, and Z0 is the impedance of free space, about 377 Ω. We can ﬁnd the capacitance using the expression for the resonant frequency:  This gives us two equations for the two unknowns  L and C , so we can solve, obtaining:  We can rewrite this expression using the fact that the length of the plate is half a wavelength:  ωres =  1√ LantCant  .  Cant = W  .  ωresZ0d  Cant = W πc L  Z0d  = W L πμ0c2d  ;  1 μ0c2  =  cid:12 0  → Cant =  cid:12 0  A d  1 π  = 1 π  Cparallel plate,  263   6.16    6.17    6.18    6.19    Chapter 6  which is to say, the capacitance seen by the feed is about 1 3 of the parallel-plate capacitance of the line, as we guessed at the beginning. A reasonable value for a square patch 8 mm high is about 9 pF. The resulting equivalent circuit of the antenna is shown in Figure 6.18.  Using this value, we can estimate the bandwidth:  δf =  1 W  2π  Rrad  ωresZ0d  = fres  Z0 Rrad  d W  ,  or in terms of the fractional bandwidth:  The fractional bandwidth of a patch antenna is linear in the height of the antenna. We need room for a reasonably thick structure to get good bandwidth. How thick does the antenna need to be? The impedance of free space is 377 Ω, so for the typical radiation resistance of about 150 Ω, we get the further simpliﬁcation:  δf fres  = Z0 Rrad  d W  .   cid:2    cid:3   .  δf fres  = 2.5  d W   6.20    6.21    6.22   Figure 6.18: Approximate Equivalent Circuit for a Resonant Square Patch at 915 MHz.  264   Reader Antennas  For a square patch at 900 MHz, W will be around 16 cm. A height d of 1.6 cm will provide a fractional bandwidth of around 2.5  1.6 16  ≈ 25%, or about 230 MHz. This turns out to be optimistic by about a factor of 1.5 when we incorporate a more accurate calculation of capacitance and the practical issue of matching to the antenna, so that a 16-mm-high antenna can provide a bandwidth of around 150 MHz—sufﬁcient to cover the whole international operation region, at the cost of a rather thick structure.  Our estimates have also assumed that the patch is suspended in air. A patch printed onto a dielectric board is often more convenient to fabricate and is a bit smaller, but the capacitance of the antenna is increased, so the bandwidth decreases. The calculations we have made also assume a very large ground plane. Real patch antennas often use ground planes only modestly larger than the patch, which also reduces performance. The details of the feed structure affect bandwidth as well.  Return loss for a pair of representative commercial patch antennas is shown in Figure 6.19; both antennas deliver substantially more than the 26 MHz needed to cover the ISM band.  Figure 6.19: Return Loss vs. Frequency for Two Commercial ISM-band Patch Antennas.  265   Chapter 6  Antenna B uses a 16-mm patch height above ground, and the measured bandwidth of about 150 MHz at 10 dB return loss is rather close to that estimated above. However, this antenna also uses a very large  30× 30 cm  ground plane. Antenna A delivers similar bandwidth but somewhat poorer performance in band, but at about 20× 20 cm is considerably smaller and more convenient to mount and position. Commercial antennas vary widely in performance, often due to poor centering of the band even when theoretical bandwidth is achieved, and can show return loss as poor as −8 to− 9 dB at the edges of the ISM band; such antennas may be wholly unsuitable for global use. Bad return loss will degrade monostatic reader operation due to transmit leakage and should be avoided! Make sure that your antennas achieve −15 dB over the band of interest. Rectangular  nonsquare  patches can be used when it is desired to produce a fan beam: a radiated wave whose vertical and horizontal beamwidths are substantially different. Circular patches can be used instead of square patches; fabrication is straightforward though calculating the current distribution is more involved!  It is also possible to fabricate patch antennas that radiate circularly polarized waves. There are a couple of different ways to do this  Figure 6.20 . One approach is to excite a single square patch using two feeds, with one feed delayed by 90 fashion, when  say  the vertical current ﬂow is maximized, the horizontal current ﬂow will be zero, so the radiated electric ﬁeld will be vertical; one quarter-cycle later, the situation will have reversed and the ﬁeld will be horizontal. The radiated ﬁeld will thus rotate in time, producing a circularly polarized wave. An alternative is to use a single feed but introduce some sort of asymmetric slot or other feature on the patch, causing the current distribution to  with respect to the other. In this  ◦  Figure 6.20: Approaches for Creating Circularly Polarized Patch Antennas. a  Square Patch with Dual Feeds, 90◦ Round Patches can be Used in Both Cases.  Phase Offset; b  Round Patch with Asymmetric Slot. Note that Square or  266   Reader Antennas  be displaced. Note that, while circular patches can be used for these techniques, a circular patch does not necessarily radiate circularly polarized waves! A symmetric circular patch with a single feed point will create linearly polarized radiation. Finally, a nearly square patch can be driven at the corner; if the length is just a bit less than resonant and the height a bit more  or vice versa , a circularly polarized wave will result.  Recall that readers may use a bistatic antenna conﬁguration, and that if circular polarization is used, dual-dipole tags will invert the sense of polarization on reﬂection. Readers that use a bistatic antenna conﬁguration often provide two circularly polarized antennas of opposite sense packaged in a single housing; this ensures that the antennas are properly oriented when mounted, though the resulting structure is large  about a meter long  and somewhat ungainly. Some designs use a ‘bathtub’ conﬁguration, with a ground plane substantially larger than the patches, and a recessed region about 5 cm deep in which the patches sit. This type of design provides excellent isolation between the two antennas  around 40–45 dB , and also return loss of −20 to −25 dB over the ISM band.  6.2.5 It’s All On the Datasheet  Except the Price!   Antenna manufacturers characterize the performance of their antennas, typically using an anechoic chamber  a room with nonreﬂecting walls , and summarize the results on a datasheet. The datasheet typically describes:    Gain: the measured gain, the actual measured peak power divided by the average  power density at the corresponding distance, is usually about equal to the directivity for large antennas—that is, all the power that goes into the antenna is radiated. Gain values in the vicinity of interest for most RFID applications—from 5 to 10 dBi— require antenna sizes on the order of half a wavelength, about 16 cm. Gain is usually reported relative to an ideal isotropic antenna  dBi  but sometimes relative to a standard half-wave dipole  dBd .    Radiation pattern: the gain does not determine the radiation pattern. The pattern is usually given in two orthogonal planes. The pattern can be given in terms of the electric ﬁeld intensity or the power density as a function of the direction of propagation and may be expressed linearly or in dB. The datasheet may also report the beamwidth in degrees, typically identiﬁed by the angles at which the electric ﬁeld has fallen by either 3 dB or 10 dB from that in the beam center.    Bandwidth and frequency of operation: the normal frequency range is usually that over which the antenna is matched to a 50-Ω cable so that most of the power sent to the antenna is transmitted and very little is reﬂected. The frequency range will be quoted for a given maximum return loss or VSWR; typically return loss is better  267   Chapter 6     than −10 dB  sometimes better than −15 dB , with corresponding VSWR <2:1 or less than 1.5:1, respectively. Unfortunately, datasheets usually don’t include measured data for return loss but merely quote a worst-case value.  Polarization: the polarization is provided in those cases where it isn’t obvious. In the case of circular polarization, some measure of the extent to which polarization is maintained across the pattern may also be given, or patterns may be provided for co- and cross-polarized receiving antennas.    Mechanical parameters: the physical size and weight of the antenna may be  critically important in some applications. Antennas intended for outdoor use may report wind resistance and weatherizing.  6.3 Antennas for Fixed Readers  6.3.1 Doors and Portals  Passive RFID readers are often used to monitor the passage of cartons or objects through a door, portal, gateway, or other localized chokepoint between different areas. Antennas for this purpose will be ﬁxed in place during most or all of their useful lifetime. In a typical case, where it is desired to monitor the loading dock of a shipment facility  a warehouse, distribution center, or receiving area , the door is from 3–5 m across, and the height of the load can vary from less than a meter to 3 m. The reader should be able to read tags located anywhere within the entry region, but should not read tags located outside this region, in order to avoid false positive reads from cartons in staging areas, objects in storage, or tags in the pockets of folks passing by. An antenna with a single beam and reasonably high gain is required to achieve both the desired read range  at least half the door width  and speciﬁcity to the region of interest. It is also desirable to view the portal zone from both sides, to detect tags on either side of a pallet load without requiring the beam to pass through possibly opaque carton contents. In addition, the beam must also cover the whole region of interest. These requirements are not easily met by a single antenna; it is typical to use four antennas placed on the opposite faces of the doorway  Figure 6.21 . The antennas are multiplexed: connected in succession to the reader. If a bistatic conﬁguration is used, four pairs of antennas are used. In most cases, the tags to be read are on pallets or cartons carried by forklifts or pallet jacks and require several seconds to move through the doorway. Read speed is not critical but fast handling of multiple tags is. When multiple adjacent doors are present, the interior readers are connected to as to view two adjacent doors  that is, a single reader’s antennas cover the left side of the door to the right of the reader and the right side of the door to the left  to avoid running RF cables over or under the doors.  268   Reader Antennas  Figure 6.21: Typical Portal Antenna Conﬁguration.  The characteristics that are important for antennas in ﬁxed applications are:    Gain: we clearly want an antenna with a single reasonably well deﬁned beam rather than an omnidirectional antenna like a dipole. The largest gain value we can use at full radiated power in the United States  without a license  is 6 dBi; we must reduce the reader power if we use more gain. There’s usually not much point in having gain higher than about 9 or 10 dBi.    Bandwidth: the antenna needs to be well matched to the reader or cable over the  band we wish to use. In the United States that will be the 902–928 MHz ISM band in most cases; in Europe, 865–868 MHz is normally allocated for RFID, and in Asia, slices may be available in the European and United States regions, or at other frequencies extending from around 860–960 MHz.    Beam shape: the single beam may not necessarily be symmetrical. We may want a fan beam  e.g. tall and thin  so that we can limit the read zone to the extent of the doorway and avoid seeing tags in a truck, or read only tags that are outside the door.  A fan beam is also useful for a reader monitoring cartons moving on a conveyor, where it isn’t really necessary to look very high or low, but it is useful to maximize the width of the read zone along the conveyor in order to ensure that tagged cartons remain in the read zone for a long time and thus, have the best chance of being read; we’ll discuss conveyors in the next Section.  Polarization: the choice of polarization is dominated by our choice of tag antenna type and orientation. Single-dipole tag antennas can only be read when copolarized  that is, when the long axis of the tag is along the direction of the electric ﬁeld     269   Chapter 6  from the reader antenna . If the tags are always oriented vertically, we must use a vertically polarized antenna or a circularly polarized antenna to read them; if the tags are horizontal, a horizontally polarized or circularly polarized antenna is needed. When the tag orientation is not controlled, a circularly polarized antenna must be used.  Recall that this results in a 3 dBreduction in power to the tag and thus, a modest reduction in read range.  Dual-dipole tags are more tolerant of variations in orientation and impose minimal requirements on reader antenna polarization. It is also worth noting that when linearly polarized antennas are used in an open indoor area, it is usually best to use vertical polarization if possible. The reason is that reﬂections from the ﬂoor are eliminated for a wide range of angles of incidence near Brewster’s angle  Figure 3.36 , producing somewhat more consistent read results as the position of tags varies.  We can use the tools introduced in Section  6.2  above to understand in a semiquantitative way what antenna conﬁgurations make sense. For example, in the portal conﬁguration of Figure 6.21, how many antennas are needed, and where should they be placed? We can make a ﬁrst estimate by applying the procedure of Figure 6.5 to roughly sketch out the read zone, using a 6-dB beam width of about 120 Figure 6.16. In Figure 6.22, we show such an estimate overlaid on a 3-meter-square  obtained from the typical patch antenna pattern of  ◦  Figure 6.22: Idealized Read Zone for Patch Antennas at a Doorway, Assuming Beamwidth Parameters from a Commercial 9-dBi Antenna.  270   Reader Antennas  doorway, assuming the maximum read range in beam center is a conservative 3 m. It’s apparent that a single pair of antennas, either both on one side or both at one elevation, will not cover the whole area of the doorway, but a pair of antennas on each side does a good job.  Naturally, the real world will not be this simple due to reﬂections from the doorframe, support posts, forklift and goods when present, and other objects in the neighborhood. If low-lying loads must be monitored, ﬂoor reﬂection is likely to be important. Note that since the beam width decreases as a tag nears the antenna, a tag near the ﬂoor or the door sill and displaced close to the door frame may not be read effectively.  6.3.2 Interference and Collocation  The reﬂected signal from a tag is small and easily swamped by the signal from a reader. An example is shown in Figure 6.23; the received power from the interfering reader is found readily using the Friis equation  3.20 , assuming both the transmitting and receiving antennas have 6-dBi gain. The power received from an interfering reader 20 m away, roughly 0.1 mW, is about 40–50 dB  that is, a factor of 10 000 to 100 000  larger than the reﬂected signal from a tag a few meters away. If the interfering reader on the same frequency as the wanted tag, it can be very difﬁcult to see the small signal against the larger one.  The ISO18000-6C standard does make special provisions for minimizing reader-tag interference; we will examine these in more detail in Chapter 8.   The importance of interference depends on the amount of spectrum available and the physical arrangement of reader antennas. An interfering reader whose signal is many MHz away from the wanted signal may be readily ﬁltered out in the radio’s baseband chain, although as we noted in Chapter 4, third-order distortion in the RF section of a radio can lead to in-band mixing products when more than one interferer is present. Readers operating on the same  Figure 6.23: Power from a Distant Interferer Can be Much Larger than a Reﬂected Tag Signal.  271   Chapter 6  channel as the victim reader, or an adjacent channel, are most likely to be a problem. In the United States, the ISM band provides 26 MHz for unlicensed use. Readers conﬁgured for frequency-hopping operation  the most common approach  are required to change channels no less often than every 0.4 second and use all channels with equal probability. Typically 500 kHz channels are used, so there are 50 channels available  allowing for guard bands . With so many channels available, the likelihood of two readers being close to each other in frequency is quite small when only a few readers are in proximity to one another.  In Europe and Asia, much less room is available. For example, ETSI recommendations allow only 865–868 MHz for unlicensed RFID operation. Readers are required to use 200 kHz channels, but this still leaves only 15 channels available  and some are limited to reduced power levels . Asian jurisdictions vary widely and can be worse; for example, in Singapore, unlicensed RFID is allocated 923–925 MHz, providing only four 500-kHz channels.  The ETSI spectrum is also available, but the total is still pretty small.  Under these conditions, co-channel or adjacent-channel interferers are inevitable if many readers are operating simultaneously and in close physical proximity.  A single facility with many collocated readers must be regarded as a system design problem: optimizing the performance of a single portal may degrade overall system performance. In addition to interference, one must consider the ratio of false negative reads  when a reader fails to read a tag in the read zone  to false positive reads  when a tag in some other area outside the intended read zone of a given read point is read . Power, duty cycle, and antenna gain and conﬁguration must be arranged to maximize joint performance rather than the performance of a single read point.  The simplest and most powerful lever for reducing interference is to turn the interfering transmitter off when it is not needed. In the context of RFID, this means that a reader should not be on when there are no tags of interest in the ﬁeld. Portal installations often include presence or motion sensors that activate the reader only when there is something within the portal worth reading; operator intervention may also be required in some applications. Turning the reader on only when needed reduces the duty cycle; when a reader isn’t on, it doesn’t interfere. Multiple sensors can also provide information on the direction of travel of goods, and good procedures can minimize unneeded reader activation.  Antenna conﬁguration can also be used to reduce interference. In some cases, it may be possible or desirable to direct antennas outwards towards a loading dock or other facility access, reducing interference as well as providing some additional locating information. A glance at our representative antenna pattern  Figure 6.16  suggests that one might hope to realize 6–12 dB antenna  12–24 dB for the link, remembering that reduced transmit radiation indicates reduced receive effective aperture . One may also synchronize the multiplexing  272   Reader Antennas  conﬁguration of multiple readers, so that only right-looking or only left-looking reader antennas are activated at any given moment. The signal from a left-looking transmitter into a left-looking receiver should be reduced by about the front-to-back ratio of the antenna, typically around 20 dB for a small patch antenna. If circularly polarized antennas are used in a bistatic conﬁguration, the right-looking receive antenna should be of opposite sense to the right-looking transmit antenna in order to receive backscattered signals from dual-dipole tags; if the same sense is used for all transmitting antennas, the left-looking receiving antennas will be cross-polarized for right-looking transmitters  and vice versa , reducing any interfering signals.  Physical isolation can be achieved through the use of screens, walls, or tunnels; if the openings are small compared to a quarter-wavelength  about 8 cm here , a conductive screen will effectively block radiation. Common interior construction materials  wood and gypsum ‘dry wall’  are modestly absorbing and reﬂecting. Concrete is a modest reﬂector at 900 MHz: the refractive index is around 3, so the reﬂection coefﬁcient for normal incidence is around  3− 1   3 + 1  =0.5. Concrete absorption varies considerably depending on the cure state and water content of the concrete. A thick concrete wall may provide only 5–10 dB of attenuation, but multiple partitions of concrete  or even dry wall  will attenuate signals fairly rapidly. Note that to be effective isolators, screens or walls must subtend a large angle relative to the transmitter; radiation can readily diffract around obstacles that are only a few wavelengths across. Rooms containing a substantial load of RF-absorbing materials  moist porous materials, fresh produce, concrete corridors, etc.  will lead to relatively rapid attenuation of distant signals, but common warehouse arrangements with large open areas near the entries are conducive to long-distance propagation.  In the United States, FCC regulations do not permit the coordination of frequencies for unlicensed transmitters, but at the time of this writing coordination of reader frequencies is under consideration for revised European regulations. Frequency planning, where permitted, can help reduce the impact of interference by ensuring that readers on the same or adjacent channels are relatively distant from one another. The resulting increase in distance is proportional to the number of available channels, n; if the area is relatively open so that signal power falls as the inverse second power of the distance, the expected reduction in  n . Recall that these beneﬁts might not be realized if interference power is 20 log10 third-order distortion is important  Chapter 4 : pairs of equally spaced channels can generate intermodulation products onto the wanted frequency in the mixer and any RF ampliﬁcation that is used, producing unﬁlterable interferers even with frequency planning. Recall that third-order distortion also doubles the spectral width due to modulation, making it more likely that a modulated reader signal will overlie the wanted tag signal in frequency.  273   Chapter 6  The ISO 18000-6C  EPCglobal Class 1 Generation 2  standard provides a special operating mode, Dense Interrogator operation  often known as dense reader mode or DRM , in which the spectra of the backscattered signals are displaced from the carrier frequencies, and the reader transmissions are kept within a narrow band around the carrier. We will discuss dense reader operation in more detail in Chapter 8. Dense reader operation makes it possible in principle for the radio’s baseband ﬁlter to select tag responses even in the presence of adjacent-channel or co-channel interferers. However, it does so at the cost of relatively low data rates for both the tag and reader; for intermediate numbers of readers and tags, it may be better to use high data rates and turn the readers off when all tags have been read.  6.3.3 Conveyor Antenna Conﬁguration  Conveyors are widely used for moving and sorting goods packaged in cartons, boxes, or shrink-wrapped containers. There are various types of conveyors. Accumulation conveyors bring loads into a conveyorized system; some are equipped with sensors to detect the size of a given object and may be able to rotate the object into a desired orientation. Transport −1. Motion can be continuous conveyors move goods long distances at speeds as high as 3 ms or intermittent. Sortation systems are used to direct cases, totes, or pieces to differing locations. The destination can be a truck dock, warehouse shelf, or a staging  assembly area. Carousel sorters are used for manual piece sorting and support rates up to about 70 items per minute per sort zone. A-frame sorters are used to pick or dispense individual items to ﬁll orders and are frequently used for pharmaceuticals. Tilt tray sorters are used to sort parcels and luggage and can reach 175 items per minute; cross-belt sorters achieve even higher rates by redirecting items to other conveyor paths as they move along a main conveyor. All these systems require accurate identiﬁcation of an object to support high-speed automation.  Conveyor antennas are often mounted on a gantry near or surrounding the conveyor  Figure 6.24 . Ideally, the location and orientation of the antennas is chosen so that all possible tag locations and orientations will be read. If pallets or tall loads are likely to be encountered, it may be necessary to stack two antennas at different heights. The orientation of an object may or may not be controlled on the conveyor. When orientation is uncontrolled, a tag may lie on any face of the item or carton and point in any direction. Simple single-dipole tags are sensitive only to radiation polarized along their axis; in this case, a circularly polarized antenna should be used. The reduction in read range is usually not critical in a conveyorized environment. Dual-dipole tags have reduced dependence on orientation but are larger and slightly more expensive than single-dipole tags.  A rough estimate of suitable locations may be obtained using the idealized read zone approach depicted in Figure 6.5; an example is shown schematically in Figure 6.25.  274   Reader Antennas  Figure 6.24: Conveyor with Antenna Gantry Showing Possible Antenna Positions and Tag Positions and Orientations.  Figure 6.25: Example of Antenna Positioning to Cover Tag Locations Using Idealized Read Zone.  275   Chapter 6  However, the real read zone is likely to be complex, with patches of good and bad reads, due to reﬂections from the conveyor components as well as the goods being transported, and the use of far-ﬁeld antenna patterns may be misleading for tags close to the antenna, as may occur with displaced loads on a conveyor. Empirical conﬁrmation is necessary for these simple estimates.  If tags may be located on the bottom of an item  which can be an issue with uncontrolled object types, as in airport baggage transport , it may be necessary to place a reader antenna below the conveyor to illuminate them. Metal rollers will ﬁlter the portion of linearly polarized illumination that is along their long axes, leaving only the perpendicular part to reach the tags; if circular polarization is required, the rollers above the antenna should be replaced with plastic rollers if load requirements permit.  The tradeoff between false negative reads  missed tags  and false positive reads  tags read that are outside the desired region  is of importance for conveyorized applications. Increa- sing reader transmit power to increase the size of the read zone may also increase the frequency of false positive reads due to tags in transport on other conveyors, on nearby forklifts, in staging areas, or being carried by people. It is often useful to proceed in the other direction and reduce the reader power since the tags of interest are relatively close to the reader. However, the reduced read zone size means the total time spent in the read zone of each antenna is reduced.  Polarization and tag orientation are also of importance in determining the real read zone. A vertically oriented tag is always along the electric ﬁeld of a vertically polarized antenna as it travels down the conveyor and passes the antenna. A horizontal tag is only lined up with a horizontally polarized antenna as the tag passes; in other positions, the tag is at an angle to  Figure 6.26: Horizontally Oriented Tags are Increasingly Misoriented at Long Distances from a Horizontally Polarized Antenna; Vertically Oriented Tags are Always Aligned Along the Field from a Vertically Polarized Antenna.  276   Reader Antennas  the electric ﬁeld and receives less signal power, reducing the extent of the read zone. A tag oriented along the direction of propagation when the box is adjacent to the antenna is invisible in that position, but as the box moves along the conveyor, the angle between the propagation vector and the tag will increase, leading to a bimodal read zone with the best reads to the left and right of the antenna.  Multiplexing antennas also means that the total time to read a tag may be rather short on a conveyor. The read zone for a conveyor is the intersection of the conveyor travel path with the normal ellipsoidal read zone  ignoring the not-necessarily negligible effects of reﬂections from the conveyor rollers and walls . If the read zone is a couple of meters long, and the −1, we have a total of about 660 milliseconds to read a tag. With conveyor travels at 3 ms four-fold multiplexing, this is reduced to about 215 milliseconds. While this is ample time to perform several read attempts from the point of view of the native tag protocols  which typically require around 1–5 milliseconds to read a tag , it is much less so if the reader duty cycle is reduced by slow host communications. Modern readers can read tags at a rate of hundreds per second during an inventory, but many readers can only launch about 10–20 inventories per second. Protocol behavior is also important; for example, a Class 0 tag cannot enter an inventory in the middle but must receive certain synchronization inputs and the tree-walk-start signal; in this case, it can be very useful to place presence sensors on the conveyor to initiate reads when a tag is likely to be present. It is also important to ensure that the software is conﬁgured for rapid reading of a small number of tags, rather than exhaustive inventory of a large number of tags; for example, in ISO 18000-6C operation, the initial value of the Q parameter must be small. We will discuss protocols in detail in Chapter 8. One must also take statistics into account. In preliminary experiments, the author has observed that the distribution of reads on a conveyor is roughly Poisson distributed; in order to ensure that tags are read at least once with >99% probability in a single pass, an average tag should capable of being read 6–7 times during its passage through the read zone.  Tags placed in air or on an empty box are usually rather frequency insensitive, but tags placed close to a metal object may experience resonant behavior and become much more frequency selective, as well as more directional. This is a particular issue for conveyorized operation because of the frequency-hopping behavior of a reader. In United States operation, the reader must hop pseudorandomly over all the channels in the ISM band. A narrow-band tag may respond very well at frequencies near  say  the middle of the band, 915 MHz, and very poorly at the edges. In a portal application, where loads may move slowly and ample time to read is often available, such a tag will be read with good consistency. When placed on a fast-moving conveyor with multiplexed antennas, the time in the read zone of an active antenna may be reduced to 100–200 milliseconds, as noted above. If the antenna is operating on a frequency where the tag is not sensitive, the tag may fail to be read, even when no prob- lem is seen in conventional portal operation or hot-spot testing. Some testing laboratories  277   Chapter 6  have made frequency-dependent hot spot testing services available; a simpler alternative is to note in static tests not merely whether a tag is read but how many times it is read per second, averaged over several seconds. Since many jurisdictions provide different and much narrower bandwidths than the United States, tags and tag placements that work in one country may work poorly in another when frequency selectivity exists.  6.4 Antennas for Handheld or Portable Readers  Antennas for handheld or portable applications face stringent constraints on size and weight not encountered for stationary readers.  Antennas for handheld applications need to be small and light, tolerant of hands and other RF-active objects near the antenna, robust against mechanical damage from bumps and drops, and frontside directed. The last requirement is in accord with the intuitive expectation of a person that when they point a handheld reader in some direction, most tag reads will come from tags generally located in that direction.  Recall from Section 6.2 that a two-element array needs to be larger than about a quarter- wave across to create much of a beam. It’s hard to get more than about 4 dBi of antenna gain from a quarter-wave dimension  8 cm . Half-wave structures can provide 6–8 dBi of gain but you have to ﬁnd room for a 16-cm antenna. This is a difﬁcult tradeoff because there are substantial beneﬁts to a high-gain antenna for a handheld device. Range is increased for the same transmitted RF power, or equivalently one can decrease the transmitted power to achieve the same range. The latter option is perhaps more valuable as it implies lower DC power consumption by the transmitter and thus longer battery life. In many handheld applications, very long range  >2 m  may be unnecessary or even undesirable, whereas a well-deﬁned read zone may be very helpful. In stationary applications, a narrow antenna beam may unduly constrain the read zone and cause tags to be missed, but in a handheld device the user gains information about the location of a tag from the behavior of tag reads as they redirect the antenna.  Polarization ﬂexibility may not be compatible with the requirements of a handheld device. Recall that a circularly polarized antenna is convenient when single-dipole tags are to be read without orientation control. However, as we will discuss below, some antenna designs that are very convenient in other respects do not lend themselves to circular polarization.  Handheld antennas are likely to be close to people’s hands. A human body is basically a sack of water from the RF point of view. Water has a dielectric constant of around 80 at room temperature and is also strongly absorptive around 900 MHz; radio waves are reﬂected by body parts, and capacitance of metal plates will be affected when a hand is close to them.  278   Reader Antennas  To avoid disturbances from nearby dielectrics, it is best to use a balanced antenna in which two symmetric halves are driven by opposed currents and no piece of the antenna is used as a ground reference; a simple example is a dipole antenna  Figure 6.27 . A balanced antenna may be larger than a single-ended antenna and requires a balanced–unbalanced transformer  balun  or other special provisions to be connected to a standard coaxial cable or grounded circuit board.  Figure 6.27: Dipole Antenna with Balun Transition to Coaxial Cable.  A dipole antenna may be balanced, but a half-wave dipole is 16 cm long at 915 MHz and thus, impractically large for many handheld applications, particularly if conﬁgured to radiate in the direction the user is looking. Dipole antennas also have modest directive gain. A dipole can be made compact by bending it; this trick is widely used in designing tag antennas, as we’ll see in Chapter 7, and can also be used for reader antennas. An example of such a compact dipole design is shown in Figure 6.28. The width of the dipole has been greatly reduced relative to a half-wave structure, in this case, to around 6 cm. However, as a consequence, the total length of those portions of the antenna that contribute to the radiated wave is also reduced. Because of this, the radiation resistance is much less than would be the case for a straight dipole, for about the same equivalent capacitance and inductance, and  279   Chapter 6  Figure 6.28: A Compact Forward-radiating Bent-dipole Antenna; After United States Patent 7,183,994.  thus, the bandwidth is also degraded  equation  6.12  . Bent dipoles are much smaller than a straight dipole, and thus, more convenient for handheld devices, but gain is generally even lower than a dipole  recall that’s only about 2.2 dB to begin with , and the bandwidth of a bent dipole decreases as it becomes more compact. Dipoles can be made compact while simultaneously maintaining decent bandwidth by making the wires fatter at the ends, producing a bowtie shaped antenna, with gain about the same as a conventional dipole.  Two approaches to obtaining a higher-gain compact antenna have been widely used. The ﬁrst is to adapt a common type of array antenna, the Yagi-Uda antenna, to use for a handheld device. A basic Yagi-Uda antenna consists of a single driven antenna, the exciter, a larger reﬂector, and one or more smaller directors  Figure 6.29 .  A small Yagi-Uda array consisting of only the reﬂector and one director can achieve about 5–8 dBi of gain. Adding more directors increases gain but with diminishing returns as the number of directors increases; practical antennas with 14- to 16-dBi gain at 900 MHz are available but are large and ungainly even for a stationary reader and quite impractical for a  280   Reader Antennas  Figure 6.29: Typical Yagi-Uda Antenna.  portable or handheld unit. However, a small array using bent dipole elements to reduce the width, and ﬂattened elements to improve bandwidth, can be ﬁt very nicely into a unit that is comfortable to hold, provides about 6 dBi of gain, and whose radiation is directed forward. Because the antenna is balanced, it is relatively insensitive to the presence of the user’s hand. The scheme is depicted schematically in Figure 6.30, along with the outline of an actual commercial implementation of this scheme, which is cut out of a thin sheet of copper.  The image shown is a cross section looking down on the structure; the actual structure is bent to constrain its width, as shown in the schematic depiction.  This structure combines three of the approaches we’ve discussed above: it uses bent dipoles, a balanced antenna with an integral balun structure, and a Yagi-Uda array. In principle, one can make circularly polarized Yagi-Uda structures, but in this context, such a structure would take too much room.  The second possible approach to making a compact, high-gain antenna is to construct a patch antenna that is reduced in size relative to the larger units use for a stationary antenna. A compact patch antenna can be conveniently mounted on the front of a portable reader  Figure 6.31 , and this approach has been used in various commercial units. Small patch antennas are also convenient for other portable applications, such as forklift-mounted readers. Circular polarization can be achieved if desired.  281   Chapter 6  Figure 6.30: A Small 3-element Yagi-Uda Can be Mounted Beneath a Handheld Body. The Inset Shows a 2-D Sketch of a Commercial Handheld Antenna; In Use, the Ends of Each Element are Bent out of the Plane into a Shallow U-shape.  Figure 6.31: Schematic Depiction of Handheld Reader with Compact Patch Antenna.  282   Reader Antennas  Figure 6.32: A Patch Antenna Can be Made Smaller by Using a Shorted Quarter-wave Patch in Place of a Half-wave Structure.  One approach that produces an immediate factor-of-two decrease in one dimension of the antenna is to substitute a quarter-wave patch for the standard half-wave patch. The gain is somewhat reduced, as the antenna is nearly isotropic in the vertical direction. The bandwidth is roughly the same as that of a half-wave structure. A quarter-wave patch is not symmetrical and will normally be used only for linearly polarized radiation.  Another approach to shrinking a patch antenna is to place a dielectric material between the patch and ground. Since light propagates more slowly in a dielectric, the resonant length is reduced and the antenna gets smaller. However, the size reduction is in effect achieved by increasing the capacitance of the antenna per unit area using the dielectric material, while the radiation resistance is decreased due to the smaller radiating area. Thus, the bandwidth is degraded  see equation  6.13  . Gain is also reduced since the patch is smaller  refer to Section 6.2.1 above . In order to minimize antenna size, it is further useful to reduce the size of the ground plane to only slightly larger than that of the patch, but this leads to considerable sensitivity of the patch resonant frequency to changes in the total capacitance, which can result from people and objects close to the ground plane. If a small patch is to be used, it should be enclosed in a thick radome to keep people and objects away from the antenna surface.  283   Chapter 6  6.5 Near-ﬁeld Antennas  The antennas we have discussed so far in this chapter launch a radiated wave whose power density decreases rather slowly  as the inverse of the square of the distance  as they propa- gate. However, this is not the only way to induce a voltage on a wire. Tags can also inductively couple to readers.  Inductive and radiative coupling both arise from the same underlying phenomenon: the potentials launched by an electrical current and associated charge. However, they have different underlying origins. Radiation arises because of an uncompensated current, either due to an unshielded element, like a dipole, or to a difference in propagation time between equal and opposite current elements. Induction results when two compensating currents are at differing distances. Let’s see how this works out.  A small loop of current can be created by applying a voltage to a single turn of wire. If the loop is very small compared to the wavelength of light at the frequency of operation, the delay in propagating across the loop is negligible, and so when viewed from a distance, the potentials from each side of the loop were launched at essentially the same time. The current from one side of the loop is of the same magnitude as that on the other side but oppositely directed. The potentials from these two current elements cancel. A small loop does not radiate  Figure 6.33 a  .  However, close to the loop, the difference in distance to the different parts of the loop becomes signiﬁcant. The potential from the nearest part of the loop is larger than that from the far side, even though the currents are the same, simply because the potentials decrease in magnitude inversely with distance. Thus, there is a substantial residual potential even though the currents are equal and opposite on opposite sides of the loop; this potential gives rise to an electric ﬁeld and can be used to create voltage by placing a wire close to the loop. Inductive coupling is obtainable close to the loop even when no radiation is present.  Very small loop antennas  1–3 cm in diameter  can be used in exactly this fashion to induc- tively couple to tags, even at UHF frequencies. When the reader and tag antennas are both small loops, only inductive coupling is present: the reader is operating as a near-ﬁeld device. Even for small loops, it is necessary to add some dissipation, usually in the form of a large resistance in parallel with the loop, because without radiation, there is very little loss in the loop and thus, the bandwidth is extremely narrow.  The problem with using a very small loop is apparent from the discussion above: induc- tive coupling is only signiﬁcant for distances on the order of the loop size. A loop antenna 1 cm in diameter will have a read range of 1 or 2 cm. Even for near-ﬁeld operation, many  284   Reader Antennas  Figure 6.33: Coupling to a Nonradiating Current Loop.  a  Cancellation of Potential at Long Distances;  b  Finite Potential at Distances Comparable to the Loop Size.  applications require longer read ranges than that. The obvious response is to make the reader antenna bigger.  Two problems crop up when we follow this path. The ﬁrst is that the inductance of the loop, which is proportional to the perimeter of the loop and thus the radius, increases, making it very difﬁcult to match the loop to a 50-ohm coaxial line.  The second problem is more subtle. The electric ﬁeld along the center of the wire, which is the joint result of the current ﬂow and net charge, must be zero. Even at low frequencies, where the loop is very small compared to a wavelength, some charge is accumulated on the loop in order to compensate the electric ﬁeld due to the current ﬂow. Just as water accumu- lates in a channel when the ﬂow rate decreases, in order to create a net charge, the electric current density must change along the wire. The amount of charge that accumulates is proportional to the time available for it to pile up, and thus, inversely proportional to frequency: at low frequencies  where the wavelength is long, and the loop looks small  only a tiny variation in the current along the loop is needed to provide lots of charge, but as the frequency increases, a larger and larger change in the current is needed to produce sufﬁcient charge. In addition, the inductive electric ﬁeld that must be compensated also increases  285   Chapter 6  Figure 6.34: Behavior of Current Around a Loop Antenna as the Size Relative to a Wavelength is Increased.  linearly with frequency. The net result is that as the size of the loop becomes signiﬁcant compared to a wavelength, the current is no longer constant along the loop  Figure 6.34 . When the circumference is about 0.4 of a wavelength, the loop experiences a parallel resonance and exhibits a very large input resistance. By the time the loop reaches about 1 wavelength in circumference, the charge required is so large that the current falls to zero and reverses direction about a quarter-way around on both sides of the loop.  Because the current is no longer circulating but instead accumulating at the top and bottom of the loop, like a dipole conﬁguration, inductive coupling along the axis of the loop becomes small: equivalently, the magnetic ﬁeld along the axis goes to zero. This occurs at a diameter of about 10 cm at 900 MHz. Thus, we have arrived at the following conundrum: with a near-ﬁeld coupled reader and tag, we can’t get long range unless we make the reader antenna large, but when the reader antenna grows large, it no longer works as an inductive antenna.  One solution to both problems is to divide the antenna into short segments, and interpose a capacitor between each pair of segments; an example is shown in Figure 6.35. If the capacitor value is chosen so that it resonates with the inductance of the segment, the input impedance of each segment is small and real, so that matching the antenna is straightforward. The capacitors also take care of the charge storage problem, so that the current can be constant in magnitude and  for resonant segments  at the same phase. A segmented antenna can still couple inductively to a tag along its axis even when the diameter is comparable to a wavelength. Using this approach, read ranges up to 8–10 cm can be achieved.  286   Reader Antennas  Figure 6.35: Example of a Segmented Near-ﬁeld Antenna; About 8 cm Read Range is Achieved on the Axis  Perpendicular to the Page . Design Details Courtesy of Steven Weigand and Nathan Iyer.  A segmented loop continues to couple inductively even at large loop diameters, but it also radiates, even though it does so mainly in the plane  like a small loop  rather than along its axis, unlike a conventional loop of the same size. This radiation is inevitable, as it arises from the fact that an observer sees the potential from the different parts of the loop at different times  see Figure 3.2 in Chapter 3 . Since the radiation is in the plane, it is possible to shield or absorb some of it, but it is important to be aware that practical large antennas constructed to couple to near-ﬁeld tags will also radiate, and thus, the attached reader may read conventional far-ﬁeld tags if they are close to the antenna.  6.6 Cables and Connectors  The best antenna isn’t very useful if signals can’t be delivered to it or extracted from it. Some readers are equipped with an integral antenna so that no connectors or cables are needed. However, most stationary reader applications require multiple antennas per reader  287   Chapter 6  and mandate ﬂexibility in the placement of those antennas. External antennas require cables to bridge between the reader radio and the antenna. While it is possible to permanently attach the cable at each end by soldering, such an arrangement is very inﬂexible! It is more common and much more convenient to use connectors so that cables, antennas, and radios can be readily swapped. Cables and connectors play an important role in real radios.  On the receiver side, losses in cables and connectors generally precede any ampliﬁcation. As a consequence, loss  dB  in cables and connectors adds directly to the noise ﬁgure of a radio receiver  equation  4.17  . Similarly, cable and connector losses subtract directly from the transmitted power, so we must either accept reduced read range, or crank up the transmitter output, which costs money both for a bigger power amp and more AC or DC power to supply to it. As we discussed in Chapter 4, the noise in a monostatic RFID receiver is often dominated by the phase and amplitude noise in the carrier leaking through to the receivier; in this case, cable loss plays less of a role in determining receiver noise performance, but long cable do increase conversion of phase noise to amplitude noise  Section 4.4.3 of Chapter 4 . Bistatic readers can achieve thermal-noise-limited sensitivity, and in this case, avoiding cable loss becomes of importance, particularly when semipassive tags are being used. Cable loss also reduces the transmitted power and thus read range. It is perfectly legal to compensate for such losses by increasing the output power of the transmitter  so long as the power at the antenna remains within legal limits , but providing for additional transmit power requires larger, more expensive power ampliﬁer stages, and more DC power consumption.  Minimizing loss often militates directly against the most convenient and inexpensive methods of antenna mounting. Short cables have less loss but detract from the freedom of the system designer to place the antenna and radio where each can most easily be used and accessed. Low-loss cabling is thick, inﬂexible, and expensive, increasingly so at higher frequencies. Connector failures can be frustrating to diagnose, and when working on the experimental side, it often seems that half of one’s time is spent ﬁnding the right connector and the other half adapting it to the proper gender! Installers and implementers need to be familiar with cables and connectors.  Almost all remakeable connections use coaxial cabling. Coaxial cables have a center conductor completely surrounded by a conductive ground shield  Figure 6.36 . Signal currents traveling along the center conductor are compensated by countercurrents in the shield, so radiation from the cable is very small.  The space between the center conductor and the shield is generally ﬁlled with a low-loss dielectric, although in some cable designs spacers are distributed periodically along the cable with most of the interstitial space ﬁlled with air. The ratio of the current in the cable to the voltage between the center conductor and the shield is a real-valued constant: the  288   Reader Antennas  Figure 6.36: Schematic Depiction of a Typical Coaxial Cable. Equal and Opposite Total Currents Flow in the Center Conductor and the Surrounding Shield.  characteristic impedance of the cable. The characteristic impedance is determined by the shield radius b, the center conductor radius a, and the relative dielectric constant ε of the ﬁll material:  Zc = 138√   cid:5  log10   cid:2    cid:3   b a  .  Common values of Zc are 50 or 75 Ω. Assuming a typical dielectric constant of around 2, a 50Ω line requires a ratio  b a  ≈ 3:1. For any given outer cable diameter, the target impedance constrains the size of the center conductor.  Unlike hollow waveguides, coaxial cables work ﬁne with signals down to DC. The highest frequency that can be used is that at which additional propagating modes, such as hollow- waveguide modes become possible within the cable. The cutoff frequency is approximately:   6.23    6.24   where c is the velocity of light.  fc =  √ c  cid:5  a + b ,  π  289   Chapter 6  Cable loss results from the ﬁnite conductivity of the center conductor and shield, as well as losses within the dielectric material if present. The current ﬂows in a narrow region near the surface of the metal, the skin depth  equation  2.2  . Typical skin depths in metals are a few microns at GHz frequencies: losses are much larger than they would be if the current ﬂowed through the whole thickness of the metal. The total area for current is roughly the perimeter of the wires multiplied by the skin depth, so loss increases with decreasing cable diameter. The skin depth decreases as the square root of frequency, so cable loss increases with frequency. Cable loss due to conductor resistance is approximately:   cid:4   αc =  1.5× 10  −4   cid:2    cid:5  cid:6   ρf   cid:3   1 a  + 1 b  1 Z0  ,   6.25   where ρ is the resistivity of the metal and Z0 the impedance of free space, 377 Ω. The loss is expressed in Nepers meter, where a Neper is  1 e  of loss. To convert to dB of loss per meter, one multiplies by 8.68. For a 1-cm-diameter, 50 Ω line, the ohmic loss would be about 5 dB 30 m at 900 MHz. Flexible coaxial cables generally use some sort of multistrand ribbon material for the shield and are subject to higher losses than would have been the case for a continuous sheath.  A bewildering variety of coaxial cables are commercially available, differing in characteristic impedance, loss, frequency range, ﬂexibility, and cost. Semirigid coaxial cables provide the best performance in most respects but at the cost of—surprise—inﬂexibility. Semirigid cables have a solid copper shield and solid inner conductor, separated by a Teﬂon variant or other low-loss insulator. The solid shield ensures that essentially no signal leaks out of the cable if it is solidly grounded at the ends; the high conductivity of the solid copper provides low loss. Semirigid cables and cable stock are available in a range of diameters and imped- ances. Semirigid cable can be bent by hand or with tube bending tools and is sufﬁciently ﬂexible to allow many cm of elastic adjustment over a 10- or 20-cm length of cable, but it is best suited for applications where the connection geometry is essentially ﬁxed.  Flexible coaxial cables come in a wide variety of sizes and construction. They are usually fabricated with a copper or copper-clad steel inner conductor and copper or aluminum ribbon or braid for the outer conductor. Polyethylene and Teﬂon are common insulators. Foamed insulation may also be used to reduce dielectric constant. From equation  5.53 , we see that large diameters are preferred for low loss, but large-diameter cables are relatively inﬂexible, awkward, and expensive. Small cables are easier to work with, particularly in tight spaces, if the excess loss can be tolerated.  Popular cable nomenclature is based on United States military standards. Radio Guide  RG  designations dating from the 1940s are still widely used. M17 names  from military standard  290   Reader Antennas  MIL-C-17, promulgated in the 1970s  are also used. The nomenclature is arranged in a quite arbitrary fashion; there is no simple correlation between the RG or M17 number and cable size, loss, or frequency rating. Performance speciﬁcations required in these standards are based on very old technology, and modern cables can easily outperform the RG specs within the same physical dimensions. The nomenclature is often used in a generic fashion, to denote cables that are similar to but not necessarily in compliance with a given speciﬁcation. Some commonly used cables and their nominal diameter are shown in Table 6.1.  Table 6.1: Common RG Cable Designations  Cable name  Outer diameter  cm   Cable name  Outer diameter  cm   RG8X RG122 RG142 RG196A RG214 RG218 RG223 RG303 RG393 RG401 RG403  0.61 0.41 0.50 0.20 1.08 2.21 0.55 0.43 0.99 0.64 0.22  RG58C RG141 RG188A RG213 RG217 RG219 RG225 RG316 RG400 RG402  0.50 0.48 0.28 1.03 1.38 2.40 1.09 0.26 0.50 0.36  Measured loss for some common RG-designated cables is depicted versus outer diameter in Figure 6.37.  Note that the diameter here is the outer diameter of the cable as provided, including the insulating cover; the diameter of the outer conductor b is signiﬁcantly smaller.  For reasonable cable sizes, a few meters is not much of a concern, but long runs  greater than 10 m  using small cables  less than 7–8 mm in diameter  should be avoided.  Connectors must satisfy a number of stringent constraints. The size of the largest open area within the connector sets the highest frequency of use; internal resonances show up as frequency-dependent reﬂection and loss for frequencies higher than the maximum rated frequency. The ground-to-ground and center-to-center contact resistance between the male and female mating connectors must be reproducibly low even after multiple make-and-break cycles. Spring-loaded female connectors simplify alignment of the center conductor, but the springs can undergo cold working and degrade with repeated usage cycles. Low electrical resistance materials must be used, but good mechanical properties are also required. Gold plating is often used to ensure excellent surface properties and corrosion resistance, but, of course, adds cost to the resulting connector. In some applications, such as connecting a  291   Chapter 6  Figure 6.37: Reported Loss for Various Commercial Cables Plotted vs. Actual Outer Diameter of Cable  Including Insulating Jacket .  PC-card reader or integral reader module to an antenna, small diameter cables must be used, so very small connectors are needed.  A wide variety of connector types  though fewer than there are of cables  is available to ﬁll these needs. We shall survey a few common types here, proceeding generally from large to small. Cross-sectional sketches of the most common types are shown in Figure 6.38.  In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission  FCC  requires that unlicen- sed radio devices be tested for compliance with regulatory restrictions before they can be offered for sale. Until very recently, the FCC regulations sought to ensure that radios in the ﬁeld used the exact conﬁguration that was tested, unless a ‘professional installer’ was doing the reconﬁguration. In order to prevent ordinary folks from messing with the equipment, the Commission requested that antenna connectors be avoided, or, if that was not reasonable, that they be ‘nonstandard’ types. Therefore, it is not uncommon to encounter variations of the standard connectors used on RFID radios, whose purpose is nominally to prevent you from making any changes to the manufacturer-provided conﬁguration; reverse-polarity connectors  in which the center pin is placed in the nominally female half and the spring in  292   Reader Antennas  Figure 6.38: Cross-sectional Drawings of Some Common Connector Types. Note That the Scale is NOT Consistent Between Sketches, but is as Indicated by the Diameter Dimension Line Provided for Each Type.  the nominally male half  are popular. In practice, with the tremendous popularity of wireless local-area-network equipment, ‘nonstandard’ connectors have become widely available in the last few years, and their use no longer presents a signiﬁcant impediment to reconﬁguration.  The highest-performance connectors, such as APC-7 or APC-3.5 types  not shown in the ﬁgure , rely on a face-to-face mating of center conductors produced by precision alignment of high-quality outer shells, avoiding the use of springs or clip arrangements. These connectors are used in instrumentation but are too large, expensive, and slow to be used in most other applications.  Type-N connectors are a very common large connector. N-connectors are versatile and can be used for high power applications. They are physically fairly large and often used to terminate large-diameter low-loss cabling. N-connectors must be aligned and screwed together, using noticeable force. They are mechanically robust and well suited for outdoor use  with rain protection . They can be used to 10 GHz. Note that both 50 Ω and 75 Ω types exist. The  293   Chapter 6  two are visually almost identical except for the center conductor diameter and will mate with each other  to the extent of being screwed together , but a 75 Ω male will make only intermittent contact with a 50 Ω female, and a 50 Ω male will bend the springs of a 75 Ω female. The resulting connection problems are frustrating to debug: you have been warned!  BNC1 connectors are extremely common in low-frequency work, and cables thus equipped are often known generically as coaxial cables. The connectors use a convenient twist-on  twist-off attachment approach and are mechanically tough and easy to use, though the connection to the cable is sometimes made sloppily and will fail in the ﬁeld. BNC connec- tors are theoretically suitable to 4 GHz, but their use above 1 GHz is inadvisable in the author’s experience. BNC connectors can be used in RFID applications but type-N, SMA, or UHF connectors provide more consistent RF performance.  Type-F connectors are widely used in consumer television connections and are almost universally encountered in 75-ohm cable TV systems in the United States. They are inexpensive and reasonably robust, but the quality of commercial connectors varies widely, and some are quite unsuitable for use at frequencies above 500 MHz. The author has also found that some of these connectors are particularly prone to introducing distortion into signals when contaminated, presumably due to poor grounding between the connector halves.  Mini-UHF connectors are reasonably robust and suitable for 900-MHz service. Reverse- polarity mini-UHF connectors are used on some RFID readers for antenna connections.  Reverse-polarity TNC connectors, not shown in Figure 6.38 but rather similar to mini-UHF, are also frequently encountered.   SMA connectors are very commonly used with semirigid cabling as well as ﬂexible coax. These screw-on connectors are usable to about 18 GHz. SMAs are reliable and provide low loss and reﬂection, but they are not intended for an unlimited number of disconnects and are mechanically delicate compared to, e.g., N-connectors. In some cases, the male pin of an SMA connector is simply the copper center conductor of the attached line, which does not offer the endurance and reliability of custom-made pins. SMA connectors should be kept clean and snugged carefully; use of a torque wrench is not indispensable but will improve the reliability of a connection. The very similar ‘2.4 mm’ connector allows for operation to somewhat higher frequencies.  The MCX and MMCX connectors are more recent additions to the stable; MMCX is the smaller version, widely used for PC-card connections. The small size and press-ﬁt  1 It had been the author’s understanding that BNC is an acronym for bayonet Naval connector, but posts in discussions groups suggest alternative interpretations.

These connectors are rated for use to 4 GHz. MCX and MMCX connectors are recom- mended for use with small cables such as RG174  M17 119  or RG188A  M17 138 . These small cables can have very high losses even if the connector works ﬁne. Cables such as these are only suitable for use in lengths of a few tens of centimeters to a meter or so. Other less common very small connectors include the GPO, U.FL, and AMC types.  6.7 Capsule Summary  Antennas are characterized by their ability to radiate in speciﬁc directions—directive gain—and the frequency over which they do it—the bandwidth. High gain means narrow beam widths for antennas that focus their power into a beam. Bigger antennas offer more gain and more bandwidth if you have the room and the money.  Vector potentials follow currents, and electric ﬁelds follow potentials, so the orientation of the radiated electric ﬁeld—the polarization—is determined by the currents ﬂowing in the antenna. If those currents change orientation as well as direction with time, the polarization may be circular rather than linear—but an antenna that radiates circularly polarized waves in one direction may produce linear polarization in another.  Antennas come in innumerable forms but a few simple ones are very popular. The dipole and its variants are the archetypal ‘omnidirectional’ antennas, and the patch antenna is an extremely popular directional antenna. Patch antennas are simple and inexpensive, and the gain available from a single patch is a good ﬁt to the gain allowed by most regulatory regimes. Bandwidth is acceptable if the patch-to-ground spacing is big enough.  Stationary readers usually use patch antennas. Polarization, tag type, and object orientation go together; with single-dipole tags controling orientation or using circular polarization, whereas with dual-dipole tags polarization is no longer critical. Antennas should be positioned so that the read zone covers all the places a tag might be; multiplex multiple antennas where needed. Readers interfere with each other and with other radios in the ISM band, who will return the favor if you don’t take care. Mitigating tricks include turning readers off when not needed, screening or blocking the direct paths from interferer to victim, frequency planning where allowed, alternating polarization sense, and exploiting Dense- Interrogator-capable readers and tags. Conveyor antennas face similar problems to those used in portals but get much less time to solve them.  Portable and handheld readers require antennas that are small and well behaved, not an easy mix of requirements. The need is best met by clever use of the space around the reader and the user, rather than by brute-force shrinkage of the antenna structure.  295   Chapter 6  Near-ﬁeld antennas are straightforward to construct when only a centimeter or two of read range is needed but somewhat more subtle when ranges comparable to the wavelength of the radiation are of interest, owing to the resonant properties of large loop antennas. One solution is to use a segmented loop with capacitive tuning.  Antennas are usually connected to readers with cables and connectors. Cables allow con- venient site selection for antennas but introduce losses; thinner cables are easier to use but more losses. Connectors are indispensable for ﬂexible and reliable attachment of cabling to readers and antennas, but the variety of connectors in common use is sufﬁcient to ensure that the appropriate gender and type of adaptor is never at hand when you need it.  6.8 Afterword: An Electron’s Eyelash  An RFID reader puts out around a watt at a frequency close to 1 GHz. This requires a peak electric current of about 10 mA. There are about 1022 electrons in one cubic centimeter of a metal wire, each carrying 1.6× 10 electrons on the surface of the wire moving in response to an imposed voltage, and changing their minds a nanosecond later, how far do they get?

It is astonishing that such displacements and much smaller ones corres- ponding to received signals, can launch waves that induce even smaller displacements in distant places, and that those displacements can in turn be reliably detected and exploited to identify distant objects.  6.9 Further Reading  6.9.1 General Antenna Theory and Practice  The most commonly encountered books in this ﬁeld, cited previously  in Chapter 3 , but now of most particular import, are:  Antenna Theory  3rd Edition , C.

You need to run cable to four antennas around a doorway. There is no time to trench the concrete ﬂoor, so the cabling must be run in conduit above the door- way. The reader, with four monostatic reverse-polarity TNC antenna connections, is mounted in a standard rack ﬁxed 1 m from the gantry, which is 4 m across around a 3-m doorway.

Cost: the total cost, including IC, substrate, antenna, adhesive, die attach, and testing, must be less than US$1 for most applications, and for high-volume supply-chain appl- ications the long-term goal is to reduce total tag cost to less than US$0.05. In contrast, a moderate-quality patch antenna for a reader application has a purchase price around US$150.        Size: in supply chain applications tags must ﬁt onto a 4-inch-  100 mm  wide label. Since the natural resonant size, half a wavelength, is about 16 cm, many tag antennas must reduce their size. In addition, many applications require total thickness < 1 mm, eliminating many potential structures from consideration.  Polarization: in many applications the orientation of tags, or the objects to which they are attached, cannot be controlled. A trade-off must be made between the use of circul- arly polarized reader antennas, sacriﬁcing range, or the use of polarization-diverse tag antennas, adding cost and size to the antenna structure.    Matching to the IC load: recall from Chapter 5 that tag IC’s consume very little  current, and need reasonable input voltage  at least enough to turn the charge pump dio- des on —that is, the IC’s have a high  parallel  input impedance. Antennas and associ- ated matching structures need to provide as high an output voltage as possible from a given incident electric ﬁeld, despite size constraints, and match to the high input impedance for good power transfer.    Getting along with the neighbors: a reader antenna can be placed in a precisely sha- ped plastic radome of known composition, and has usually has some hope of a clear ﬁeld of view in the beam direction. In contrast, tags label objects and ideally should do so irrespective of the dielectric or conductive properties of those objects.  305   Chapter 7  Figure 7.1: An Assortment of Commercial Designs for Passive UHF Tags  not to scale .  In meeting these constraints, tag designers have created a variety of unusual antenna struc- tures  Figure 7.1 , which we shall attempt to classify and explain.  7.2 Impedance Matching and Power Transfer  The ﬁrst goal of the tag antenna must be to deliver power to the tag IC to turn it on; if that doesn’t happen, nothing else matters. We have previously examined how much power an ante- nna of known gain can receive, arriving at the Friis equation  3.20 . Is this actually the power delivered to the tag IC, or is there a chance of something being lost in translation? To ﬁgure this out, we must consider more carefully the question of how electrical power is delivered to a load  Figure 7.2 .  Any real source of voltage or current has some associated limitations on how much voltage or current can actually be supplied; in the case of an antenna, this takes the form of a linear  306   Tag Antennas  Figure 7.2: Voltage Source with Source Resistance RS and Load Resistance RL.  source impedance. When the source impedance is purely resistive, it is fairly easy to show that the maximum power is delivered to a load resistor of the same value.  The current is obtained from Ohm’s law:  The power dissipated in each resistor, from equation  3.3 , is:  but since the voltage on each resistor is just IR from Ohm’s law, and the current is the same through both source and load  it has nowhere else to go , we can also express this as:  I =  V  RS + RL  .  2  PS = VS 2RS  ; PL = VL 2RL  2  PS = I2RS 2  ; PL = I2RL 2  .  307   7.1    7.2    7.3    Chapter 7  Substituting the current into the expression for power, we ﬁnd:  PL =  RLV 2  2 RS + RL 2  = 1 RS   cid:2    cid:5    cid:3   cid:2   RL  2  1 +   cid:4   cid:3   RS RL  V 2   cid:4  cid:6 2 .  RS   7.4   The second form is plotted as a function of the ratio of the load to source resistance for a ﬁxed source resistance in Figure 7.3. The load power for a ﬁxed source resistance is maximized when the source and load resistances are equal: this is known as a matched load. Since the situation is entirely symmetrical, the same remark is true when we vary the source resistance while keeping the load ﬁxed: the best power transfer always occurs when the source and load resistance are the same.  S  Figure 7.3: Load Power Multiplied by the Source Resistance, as a Function of the Ratio of Load to Source Resistance.  In the more general case where the source and load include a reactance—that is, a complex part, due to some inductance or capacitance or both—the expression for the current is still of the same form but with a complex part  see Appendix 3 :  I =   RS + jXS  +  RL + jXL  .  V   7.5   S  308   Tag Antennas  A resistor doesn’t know or care what the phase of the current ﬂowing through it is; the dissi- pated power is only sensitive to the size of the current:  PL =  I2 RL  =  2  V 2RL   RS + jXS  +  RL + jXL 2  =  V 2RL  2ZS + ZL2 ,   7.6   where  denotes the modulus of the complex quantity, that is, the length of the vector in the complex plane, and we have introduced the impedance Z = R + jX. The largest power will be obtained when the denominator is small. For ﬁxed values of the real source and load resis- tances, the denominator is minimized when the imaginary part is 0  Figure 7.4 : that is, when the reactances of the source XS and load XL cancel each other out. This cancellation is mana- ged by providing reactances of different sign for the source and load; thus, if the load is capaci- tive  negative reactance  then the source must be inductive  positive reactance  and of the same magnitude. When the real parts of the source and load impedances are the same, and the complex parts are of the same magnitude but opposite signs, the two impedances are complex conjugates, differing only in the sign of the imaginary part, so the condition of maximum power transfer is also known as conjugate matching.  Figure 7.4: The Shortest Possible Length of a Complex Vector with a Fixed Real Part Occurs when the Imaginary Part  XS + XL here  is Equal to 0.  Returning to the problem at hand, we can treat the tag antenna electrically as a voltage source, the open-circuit voltage VOC, connected through a complex impedance consisting of the  309   Chapter 7  Figure 7.5:  a  Antenna with Open-circuit Voltage and Complex Source Impedance Connected to IC, approximated as Linear Load Impedance.  b  Conjugate-matched Case.  radiation resistance Rrad and any inductances or capacitances, absorbed into a reactance Xant; we similarly treat the IC as a linear but complex load impedance  Figure 7.5 a  .  Recall from Chapter 5 that this is only an approximation; the diodes that form the input charge pump are nonlinear devices, and will result in the generation of some harmonics of the input frequency. In the interests of simplicity we shall treat the IC as a linear load, but the harmonics generated by the IC are not necessarily negligible and can affect regulatory compliance of the tag-reader system.  Maximum power transfer will occur when the source and load reactances are conjugate-matched and cancel, producing the situation in Figure 7.5 b . It is this condition that is normally assumed in calculating the gain of an antenna, and therefore the received power calculated using the Friis equation is only delivered to the tag IC when this conjugate matched condition exists:  PAv = Iant  2Rload 2  2  = Voc 8Rrad  .  When perfect matching does not exist, the power delivered to the IC is less than that predicted by the Friis equation. We can use equation  7.6  to ﬁnd the ratio of the power delivered to the IC to the maximum power it could have received according to the Friis equation, the power transfer coefﬁcient τ:  τ = PL PFriis  =  Voc  2Rload  2Zant + Zload2  8Rrad 2 Voc  = 4RloadRrad  Zant + Zload2 .  The power transferred to the tag IC, and thus the tag read range, are maximized when τ = 1. When the power transfer coefﬁcient is less than 1, the read range is proportional to the square root of τ.   7.7    7.8   310   Tag Antennas  So the problem of designing a tag antenna becomes the problem of constructing an antenna that provides a good conjugate match to the IC. Recall from Chapter 5 that a tag IC can be approximately represented as the parallel combination of some capacitance and some resis- tance. The capacitance is typically around 0.5 pF, and the resistance is inversely proportional to the power consumption of the IC and the efﬁciency of the charge pump. For an IC that requires a 0.5-V input, with a 25% efﬁcient charge pump, and consumes 25 μW, the current ﬂow will be 100 μA and the equivalent input resistance 5000 Ω. However, we should not simply set Rload = 5000 in the equivalent circuit of Figure 7.5, because this load resistance is in parallel with the capacitance of the IC, not in series. The impedance of a series combina- tion of  say  1000 Ω and 0.5 pF is in general very different from that of a parallel combina- tion of the same components  Figure 7.6 a  . Fortunately, at any particular frequency, we can ﬁnd new values of resistance and capacitance such that a series resistance and capacitance present the same impedance as the original parallel circuit  Figure 7.6 b  . We can insert these equivalent series values into Figure 7.5 and thus establish the require- ments for a matched antenna.  Figure 7.6:  a  A Resistor and Capacitor may Produce Very Different Impedances when Connec- ted in Series or in Parallel;  b  at any given Frequency, a Parallel Circuit can be Represented by a Series Circuit using Appropriately Modiﬁed Component Values.  The relationships between the series  s  and parallel  p  component values that produce the same impedance at a given frequency f = ω 2π are:  Rs =  Rp  1 +  ωCpRp 2 ; Cs = 1 +  ωCpRp 2  ω2CpR2 p  .   7.9   These relationships are plotted for representative values of the parallel component values in Figure 7.7. The series and parallel capacitances don’t differ a lot, but the series resistance is  311   Chapter 7  Figure 7.7: Values of Series Capacitance Cs and Resistance Rs that Produce the Same Impedance as Parallel Capacitance Cp and Resistance Rp at 915 MHz.  inversely related to the parallel resistance. For reasonable values of around 0.5 pF capacitance and 5000 to 10 000 Ω load resistance, the corresponding series values are 0.5 pF and 12 to 24 Ω. So in summary, the matching problem for the antenna looks like Figure 7.8: for best range, the antenna ought to present a load that looks like a series resistance value of about 18 Ω, and a series inductance that resonates with 0.5 pF.  At 915 MHz, that’s about 60 nH.   Figure 7.8: Typical Load Presented to Tag Antenna by Tag IC.  312   Tag Antennas  A second beneﬁt of producing a good match to the tag impedance is that we can in general obtain some voltage ampliﬁcation. To see how this arises let us ﬁrst consider the simpliﬁed sch- ematic of Figure 7.5 b . In the case where only the two resistors are present and are of equal value, the voltage across the load resistor is simply half of the open-circuit voltage. When one wishes to calculate the current ﬂowing through the circuit, the simpliﬁed schematic is quite sufﬁcient if the reactances of the antenna and IC are equal and opposite. However, the voltage on the IC is not the voltage across the equivalent series resistor, but rather the voltage across the series combination of the resistor and capacitor. This is an important distinction, because while the series resistor is typically small in value, the reactance of the series capacitance is quite substantial. The voltage across the IC is obtained by multiplying the current in the circuit by the impedance of the series R–C circuit. When the circuit is conjugate-matched, this is simply:   cid:7  cid:7  cid:7  cid:7  cid:7  cid:7  cid:7  cid:7    cid:7  cid:7  cid:7  cid:7  cid:7  cid:7  cid:7  cid:7  ≈  VIC Voc  =  Rload + 1 2Rload  jωCIC  1  2ωCICRload  .   7.10   For typical component values this is quite a bit larger than 1. For example, if CIC = 0.5 pF, XIC ≈ −j350 Ω. For a series equivalent load resistance of 18 Ω, we can expect a voltage multiplication of about  350   36  ≈ 10. This ampliﬁcation is very helpful in achieving good read range, since as the reader will recall from Chapter 5, a tag needs a high enough voltage to turn the input diodes on before it can rectify effectively. A tag 5 meters from a reader antenna radiating the maximum allowed power of 4 W EIRP experiences an electric ﬁeld of about 3 V meter. If the tag is 9 cm long, the open-circuit voltage is roughly 0.14 V, not nearly enough to drive the input rectiﬁer. However, after matching, about 1.3 V will appear on the IC, more than sufﬁcient to allow the rectiﬁers to function.  The manner in which we obtain the antenna reactance Xant is also important, particularly because it bears upon the bandwidth over which tag performance will be acceptable. The argument is essentially the same as that of Section 6.2.3 of Chapter 6. At the frequency where the tag and antenna are perfectly matched, the reactances cancel and the total resistance seen by the voltage source is just 2Rrad. As frequency changes, the reactance will increase in magnitude; when the reactance becomes comparable in magnitude to the resistance, the power transfer coefﬁcient will be reduced by a factor of 2 and the read range by a factor of about 1.4. We can thus conveniently deﬁne the tag bandwidth as  Xant + XIC = 2Rload@  f − fctrr = BW 2   7.11    cid:9   .   cid:8   313   Chapter 7  The best bandwidth will be obtained when the antenna reactance is a simple inductor. Obtain- ing the same reactance by using, for example, the series combination of an inductor and a capacitor will produce a stronger frequency dependence:   cid:11  cid:12    cid:13   jω0Lsimple  =2πLsimple   cid:10   d df  = jω0  2Lsimple − j  cid:10   cid:11  cid:12   1   cid:13  ω0  Cres   Cres =  1  ω2Lsimple   7.12   d df  =6πLsimple  In general, the bandwidth is inversely proportional to the Q factor, which is the ratio of the total reactance to the resistance. For a simple series resonant circuit, Q is about twice the voltage ampliﬁcation factor  equation  7.10  . Thus, voltage ampliﬁcation must be traded against bandwidth. Antennas with large reactance  that is, large values of inductance and small values of capacitance  and small values of resistance may be adjusted to be matched to the tag at one frequency, with good power transfer and voltage multiplication, but perfor- mance will degrade at other frequencies. Antennas with small reactance will provide better performance over frequency.  We are now equipped to evaluate various tag antenna alternatives against these requirements.  7.3 Dipoles and Derivatives  The author would likely be in much better ﬁnancial condition if the title of this section referred to ﬁnancial risk mitigation tools rather than the half-wave dipole we brieﬂy encountered in Chapter 6. Nevertheless, the humble dipole forms the basis of a great many approaches to tag antenna design. The native half-wave dipole is shown both geometrically and in electrically equivalent form in Figure 7.9.  Figure 7.9: Half-Wave Dipole as a Tag Antenna.  314   Tag Antennas  It is apparent that an unmodiﬁed half-wave dipole is not a terribly good antenna for a typical tag IC. The antenna reactance is very small, so there’s nothing to remove the quite substantial reactance of the tag IC  corresponding to an imaginary impedance of about 350 Ω . The power transfer coefﬁcient is on the order of 4 65  18  3502 ≈ 4%, due to the large uncompensated reactance of the IC capacitance. In consequence, we don’t even get far enough to discover that the radiation resistance is poorly matched to the effective series resistance of the tag. Finally, the physical antenna, at 16 cm long, is too big for labels and many other applications. If we are to preserve the essential simplicity of the dipole but still obtain decent performance, we need to make some changes.  7.3.1 Wiggling Wires  The easiest problem to tackle is the mechanical one. If we want to make the dipole smaller, we just put the squeeze on it  Figure 7.10 . By bending the wires, we can reduce the linear extent taken up by 16 cm of wire to something less, depending on how much bending we’re inclined to do. A dipole that is shortened in this fashion is known as  surprise!  a bent dipole. As more bends are added, the dipole starts to look like a river meandering across ﬂat terrain, and is known as a meandered dipole. With enough bends, we can make the dipole much shorter for the same length of wire.  Figure 7.10: A Half-wave Dipole can be made Shorter by Bending the Wires.  Bending the dipole is not without electrical consequences. Radiation resistance is a conseq- uence of power lost to radiated waves, and radiated waves, as the reader will recall, arise from uncompensated currents. The linear ﬂow of current along a dipole is all in one direc- tion and the radiation from all the current along the dipole adds to create a vector potential  315   Chapter 7  Figure 7.11: The Current in Neighboring Arms of a Meandered Structure Flows in Opposite Directions and Does Not Radiate.  in the same direction as the current ﬂow. When the dipole is meandered, the direction of the current ﬂow in neighboring arms of a meander is inverted, so that to a good approximation these currents cancel when viewed from a long distance, and contribute no radiation  Figure 7.11 . The more squeezing we do to ﬁt the antenna into a smaller space, the more effective the cancellation is. For a densely meandered antenna, a pretty good guess at the radiation resistance is obtained by considering that only the parts of the antenna that are orie- nted in the original dipole direction contribute to radiation. The radiated potential is thus reduced by the ratio of the length of radiating current in the meandered dipole to that in the original dipole, and the radiated power  being proportional to the square of the electric ﬁeld  by the square of that ratio. That is, if the length of the antenna in the original direction is Lproj, the radiation resistance is approximately:   cid:8    cid:9 2   cid:8    cid:9 2  Rrad,meander ≈  Lproj  Lhalf-wave  Rrad,half-wave ≈  2Lproj  λ  65.   7.13   In addition, the capacitance and inductance of a meandered structure are not the same as those of a straight structure. The self-inductance of a wire results from the magnetic vector potential A along each part of the wire, which is created by the current ﬂowing in the same direction on  316   Tag Antennas  other parts of the wire. All the current in a dipole ﬂows in the same direction, so each current element contributes to the potential at all positions along the wire, albeit with a decreasing effect inversely proportional to distance along the wire  Figure 7.12 a  . When the dipole is bent, all parts of the wire are no longer parallel. Current ﬂowing in segments perpendicular to any particular location makes no contribution to the magnetic vector potential at that location on the wire  Figure 7.12 b  . Furthermore, the potential arising from neighboring currents ﬂowing in opposite directions tends to cancel. The result is that a densely-packed meandered structure has signiﬁcantly less inductance per unit length than a straight dipole. The capaci- tance per unit wire length of a meandered structure is also reduced, simply because the charge on the wire is packed closer and closer, increasing the voltage on the wire for the same total charge.  Figure 7.12: Meandered Wires have Less Self-inductance due to Orthogonal and Opposing Current Flows.  Since the resonant frequency of the antenna is inversely proportional to the product of inductance and capacitance, when these are reduced, the resonant frequency is increased. A meandered dipole has a higher resonant frequency than a straight dipole for the same wire length. To obtain 900 MHz operation from a meandered dipole, we will need a larger total length than would have been the case using a straight dipole.  Some experimental data for bent antennas made from 0.6-mm-diameter wire is summarized in Figure 7.13, conﬁrming the expectation that as the antenna is bent more tightly, the inductance and capacitance fall and the resonant frequency increases for a ﬁxed wire length. Note that the data shown here is for monopoles above a large ground plane. A monopole can be regarded as seeing half the voltage of the corresponding dipole, so the capacitance is doubled and the inductance is halved relative to a dipole. Since the monopole is half as long, the capacitance per unit length is increased by 4-fold relative to a dipole, and the inductance per unit length is unchanged. At the most densely folded conﬁguration, a wire length of about 17 cm for the  317   Chapter 7  Figure 7.13: Experimental Values of Inductance and Capacitance per Unit Length, and Resonant Frequency, for Increasingly-dense Bent Wire Monopoles.  monopole, or a 34-cm-long dipole, would be needed to deliver a resonant frequency of around 900 MHz. This is more than twice as long as a straight dipole.  Even once the dipole antenna is squeezed down to an acceptable projected length, and exten- ded enough to achieve resonance, we still face the problem of matching. Let us consider, as an example, a meandered resonant antenna with a projected length of 9 cm  so that it will ﬁt on a label , and a tag IC with equivalent circuit as in Figure 7.8. The radiation resistance will be roughly 65 9 16 2 ≈ 20 Ω, a good match to the equivalent series resistance of the tag. How- ever, the reactance of the antenna is about 0. The power transfer coefﬁcient from equation  7.8  is about:  τ ≈   cid:7  cid:7  cid:7  cid:7 20 +   cid:14  18− j  4 18  20  1  2π  915× 106  0.5× 10−12   ≈ 1.2%.   cid:15  cid:7  cid:7  cid:7  cid:7 2   7.14   318   Tag Antennas  That is, only about 1 100 of the received power makes it into the tag. Since the forward-link- limited range is proportional to the square root of the power, this corresponds to a 10-fold reduction in read range vs. a matched antenna—hardly desirable. How can we improve the match of antenna to IC?  One approach is to make the antenna wire longer than resonance, while keeping the same projected length  that is, more meandering! . Dipole antennas longer than resonance are inductive, and thus have positive imaginary reactance which will tend to cancel out the capacitance of the IC. We need a reactance of about j350 Ω or 60 nH at 915 MHz, which at the inductance density  Figure 7.13  would require about 15 cm of wire. While this length will be reduced somewhat using printed lines, which have a modestly higher inductance per unit length, several additional cm of wire will be required. An example of such an approach in a commercial antenna design is shown in Figure 7.14  see Rao et al. in Further Reading for more details on this structure . The total length of the antenna is about 33 cm, meandered to ﬁt within the 10-cm label constraint. The additional straight bar at the top of the structure acts as a bit of shunt capacitance, helping to trim the radiation resistance to the input resistance of the tag IC.  Figure 7.14: Meandered Tag Antenna, after Rao et al.; Note that the Structure is Designed to Operate at 830 MHz as shown, but the Trace Length is readily Trimmed to Provide Good Performance at Higher Frequencies.  7.3.2 Match L with L of L  A second approach to adapting a short antenna to the capacitive IC load is to add a matching structure. One possible structure uses a combination of shunt and series inductors; such an approach is shown in Figure 7.15. The shunt and series inductors are realized as lengths of conductive line connecting the antenna to the IC.  To analyze this structure it is very helpful to depict its action on the Smith Chart.  See Appendix 4 for a description of this useful graphical tool.  An example is shown in  319   Chapter 7  Figure 7.15: Shunt Series Inductors match a Capacitive Antenna to a Capacitive Load.  Figure 7.16. For simplicity we have depicted matching a single-ended circuit  like a mono- pole  rather than a balanced dipole, and we have used somewhat unrealistic values of ante- nna and tag impedance to move the loads a bit farther from the edge of the chart so that they are easier to see. Our goal is to transform the radiation resistance of the antenna to the complex conjugate of the IC impedance.  One can equivalently start from the IC impedance and transform to the radiation resistance—that is, proceed from right to left instead of left to right.  The real radiation resistance of the antenna  point 1  is added to the reactance of the antenna capacitance and inductance; in this case, we have assumed that the antenna is shorter than the resonant condition and so is slightly capacitive  point 2 . The shunt inductor moves the antenna impedance along a circle of constant conductance onto the top  inductive  half of the chart  point 3 . The series inductor then moves the load along a circle of constant resistance until the total impedance  point 4  is the conjugate of the load presented by IC. By increasing the conductance of the shunt inductor  which is just a matter of making it shorter  we can move farther around the circle to access smaller series resistances, at the cost of  320   Tag Antennas  Figure 7.16: Example of Shunt-Series Inductance Matching Depicted on a Smith Chart.  requiring increased series inductance to complete the match. The inductance values required are a few tens of nH and readily realized. A detailed example is provided in the exercises.  One of the ancillary beneﬁts of matching the load is an increase in the voltage applied to the IC, which as the reader will recall is very helpful in turning on the diodes in the IC charge pump. For a pure reactive power match the available power must remain constant, so the voltage is increased by the square root of the ratio of resistances, where the load resistance should be regarded as the shunt value in this context.  7.3.3 Getting Loaded  Another method of making a shorter antenna with suitable impedance is to ﬂare the end of the antenna out to a larger structure; this increases the antenna capacitance and is known as capacitive tip-loading. Since the magnitude of capacitive reactance decreases as the capacitance increases, a tip-loaded dipole looks more inductive than a conventional dipole of the same length, and is easier to match.  321   Chapter 7  Classic tip-loaded dipoles often used metal spheres for loads, with capacitance proportional to the sphere’s surface area. Printed tag antennas must use ﬂat structures, and the added capacitance is roughly proportional to the perimeter of the loading shape rather than its area. Examples of measured data for a wire monopole 3.1 cm long loaded by disks of varying size are shown in Figure 7.18. Disks with radii of around 1 cm provide capacitance of about 1 pF, and  Figure 7.17: A Dipole can be Shortened Without Unacceptably Large Reactance by Adding Capaci- tance to the Tips.  Figure 7.18: Resonant Frequency of a 3.1-cm Wire Monopole Loaded with Flat Disks of Varying Radius r.  322   Tag Antennas  allow a resonant antenna at 900 MHz that will ﬁt into a 10-cm projected length constraint  although just barely—it helps to ﬂatten out the loading structure, which has little effect on its capacitance .  An example of a commercial antenna structure that employs tip loading and inductive match- ing is shown in Figure 7.19. This speciﬁc structure also used printed conductive ink to form the antenna structure. As we noted in Section 5.6 of Chapter 5, such inks have a sheet resis- tance of around 20 mΩ square. The narrow part of the antenna structure of Figure 7.19 is about 90 squares long, producing an ohmic resistance of 1.8 Ω, tolerable compared to the radiation resistance of around 10–20 Ω. On the other hand, if one constructs a meandered inductive dipole of the type depicted in Figure 7.14, the antenna represents about 330 squares using 1 mm lines. The corresponding ohmic resistance of around 7 Ω is substantial compared to the expected radiation resistance, and will result in noticeably degraded performance. Different material systems may impose different constraints on tag antenna design.  Figure 7.19: Texas Instruments Class 1 Generation 2 inlay  2006 , using Tip Load and Inductive Matching to Fit within 9 cm Projected Length.  A second commercial antenna design that combines all three techniques we have discussed is shown in Figure 7.20. The tip load here uses line reversal and could also be regarded as a variation of the meandered structure.  7.3.4 Fat and Thin  The antennas we have examined so far are wire-like. They are convenient to manufacture, but have relatively high inductance and small capacitance. As a consequence, the antenna reactance is relatively large, and thus bandwidth is reduced relative to the potential bandwidth of the tag IC. It is well-known that a dipole antenna that uses thicker elements is more broadband; in the simplest view, this is because the capacitance is increased and inductance reduced for the same  323   Chapter 7  Figure 7.20: Alien Technology Class 1 inlay  2005 , using Tip Load, Meandered Lines, and Induc- tive Match.  resonant frequency, so the Q of the antenna is less and bandwidth larger. For a cylindrical wire, the inductance is proportional to the logarithm of the ratio of length to diameter:   cid:2    cid:3   .  L d   cid:11  ∝ L ln  The inductive reactance jω cid:11  thus also scales as the log of the aspect ratio. At resonance the magnitude of the capacitive reactance must equal the inductive reactance, so the capacitance must scale as 1 ln L a . On the other hand, the radiation resistance is basically a function only of the length of the wire, since it depends only on the integral of the current  as long as the wire width is small compared to a wavelength . Therefore the quality factor of the antenna, the ratio of reactance to resistance, scales with the logarithm of aspect ratio, and the bandwidth inversely:   7.15    7.16    cid:2    cid:3   L d  Q ∝ ln  → BW ∝   cid:3  .   cid:2   1 L d  ln  The logarithm changes very slowly, so big variations in the shape of the antenna are needed to produce modest improvements in bandwidth. In Figure 7.21, we show the dependence of relative bandwidth  deﬁned here as the range over which the reactance of the antenna is less than 50 Ω  vs. the inverse logarithm of the aspect ratio for cylindrical wire antennas. To improve bandwidth from  say  7% to 14% we must decrease the aspect ratio of the antenna from 10 000:1 to about 80:1—a substantial change!  The ﬂat printed structures used for tag antennas behave in a qualitatively similar fashion, but are different in that for large linewidths, the current or charge near the center of the wire must be accounted for, which does not happen for a cylindrical wire. The result is that scaling is more like:   cid:4    cid:2    cid:3    cid:5    cid:11  ∝ L  ln  L w  + 0.2  − 0.3  L w   7.17   324   Tag Antennas  Figure 7.21: Bandwidth vs. Aspect Ratio for Resonant Cylindrical Wire Dipoles, after Balanis and Stutzman & Thiele.   as long as thickness is negligible compared to width  and therefore the beneﬁts of chunky structures are reduced relative to a cylinder. In Figure 7.22, we show bandwidth estimated from measurements on 5-cm-high copper ribbon monopoles at 1 GHz, as the width of the antenna is varied from about 2 mm to 3 cm. We see that ribbons behave similarly to wire monopoles at the narrowest widths, but that the very wide ribbons provide less beneﬁts in Q and bandwidth than would be expected by extrapolation from cylindrical wires.  Nevertheless, ﬂat ribbon-like antennas provide a very considerable improvement in bandwidth relative to meandered wire antennas. A comparison of the measured equivalent circuit para- meters for two representative structures of similar projected length is shown in Figure 7.23. A 20-fold reduction in aspect ratio  based on length rather than wire length  results in a roughly 3-fold improvement in Q and thus in bandwidth.  Note that voltage multiplication at the IC will also be reduced by the same factor.   It is clear that broad thin structures provide signiﬁcant beneﬁts in operating bandwidth, despite one dimension  thickness  being much less than length or breadth. Of course, once the reactance of the antenna and matching structure are reduced to the smallest possible value, the bandwidth  325   Chapter 7  Figure 7.22: Bandwidth Estimated from Measured Q 1 GHz  for Thin Ribbon Monopoles, 5 cm High, vs. Rough Estimate of Inductance Scaling. Trend Line is Extrapolated from Data of Figure 7.21.  Figure 7.23: Comparison of Measured Equivalent Circuit Parameters for Two Antennas of Similar Length but Varying Aspect Ratios.  326   will still be limited by the reactance of the IC input. Very broad structures may also increase manufacturing cost, depending on the techniques used for antenna deﬁnition. Nevertheless, fat tag antennas have seen wide commercial deployment. Some typical broadband structures are shown in Figure 7.24. Aspect ratios are roughly 5:1 to 7:1 for these structures.  Tag Antennas  Figure 7.24: Commercial Broadband Structures, Approximately to Scale.  From left: Alien Techno- logy  2 , Omron, Rafsec  2  .  7.3.5 Folding Up  Another dipole-like structure sometimes encountered in tag antennas is the folded dipole. A folded dipole is constructed from a conventional dipole by attaching a second length of wire to the ends of the ﬁrst dipole, where the spacing between the two is small compared to a wavelength  Figure 7.25 a  . Folded wire dipoles are popular antennas whenever relatively high-impedance line is to be used instead of coaxial cable to connect to the antenna, because a resonant folded dipole has a radiation resistance four times larger than the equivalent conventional dipole—about 280 Ω is typical. A resonant folded dipole is a good match for 300 Ω twin-wire transmission line.  The folded dipole can be analyzed by decomposing the applied voltage into a part that is differ- ential—that is, the two wires receive opposite voltages—and a part that is common, where the left and right segments receive the same voltage  Figure 7.25 b  . The differential voltages propagate along something that looks like a twin-wire transmission line; since the current on the left wire is always equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to that on the right wire, the radiation from these currents cancels and so the transmission-line part of the voltage has no  327   Chapter 7  Figure 7.25:  a  Folded Dipole;  b  Decomposition of Voltage into Differential  Transmission- Line  and Common-mode Components.  radiation resistance associated with it. In the special case where each half of the antenna is a quarter-wavelength, the transmission line segments transform the short at their end into an open, so that the transmission line voltage draws no current at all.  Since the impedance of a dipole is not a very sensitive function of its cross-section, the pair of wires can be regarded as a regular dipole as far as the common-mode voltage is concerned. Thus the common-mode current at resonance is just what would have resulted from half the applied voltage ﬂowing through the radiation resistance of the ordinary dipole. Half of this current ﬂows on the left wire segments and half on the right; however, the actual input conne- ction only sees the current ﬂowing on the left segment. The net result is that for a given input voltage, we obtain ¼ of the current that we would have observed from a conventional dipole; this means that a resonant dipole has a radiation resistance four times larger than a standard dipole, roughly 260–280 Ω.  In a tag antenna application, a resonant folded dipole without matching is a somewhat better per- former than a resonant single dipole. The open-circuit voltage for a given electric ﬁeld is twice as large as that of a conventional dipole  and thus roughly equal to the produce of antenna length and incident electric ﬁeld . At resonance, the antenna looks like a pure resistance of just less than 300 Ω, looking at a nearly pure capacitive reactance –j 350  Ω. Thus, a bit more than half the open-circuit voltage appears across the IC load. The power transfer coefﬁcient is better than a standard dipole, but not very good, mainly because of the poor match of the high-impedance antenna to the low-series-impedance load:  328   τ = 4 Rload Rrad Zant + Zload2  ≈ 4 280  18  280− j3502  ≈ 10%.  Tag Antennas   7.18   And, of course, a resonant folded dipole is too big for most applications.  We can use the same approach to matching a shorter-than-resonant folded dipole we used before, with a shunt and series inductance realized as conductive lines. Folded dipoles are easier to match to the tag IC load than a conventional dipole, and allow operation with lower tag power  and thus higher values of the equivalent resistance of the IC . A folded dipole provides more voltage to the load for the same quality factor Q of the matching network.  Structures with additional wires can be fabricated. Two shorting wires produce a 3-fold-larger open-circuit voltage and a 9-fold increase in radiation resistance vs. a standard dipole, and three wires produce, respectively, 4× and 16× increases—that is, the radiation resistance is propor- tional to the square of the total number of wires, and the open-circuit voltage is linear in the number of wires. Since the resistance increases faster than the open-circuit voltage, adding wires doesn’t increase the actual voltage delivered to an unmatched IC signiﬁcantly, but again the larger value of the radiation resistance simpliﬁes matching by moving the antenna load closer to the open-circuit part of the Smith chart.  The author has not encountered commercial tag designs that are classic unmatched folded dipoles. However, variants of the folded dipole have achieved commercial signiﬁcance. The Alien Technology I-tag designs can be regarded as folded dipoles with shunt  series inductive matching  Figure 7.26 . Dual-dipole designs used by Symbol Technologies  now part of  Figure 7.26: Commercial Tag Using Folded-dipole-like Antenna with Matching Structures.  329   Motorola  and Avery Dennison are somewhat similar to three-armed folded dipoles, though they are asymmetric and detailed analysis is somewhat involved.  Chapter 7  7.3.6 Polarization  Electric ﬁelds point in a direction in space; if they are part of a traveling wave, that direction deﬁnes the polarization of the wave. Electric ﬁelds induce currents in conductors whose sur- faces are parallel to them, and do very little when the conductive surface is orthogonal to the ﬁeld. Tag antennas are necessarily made of thin conductors and usually will have no sensitivity to radiation perpendicular to their plane. In addition, most of the antennas we’ve examined are elongated in one direction, and will readily interact with ﬁelds polarized along that direction, while having little to do with ﬁelds along the short axis. This means that some combinations of polarization and orientation will enable tags to be read, and other combinations will result in tags that are invisible to the reader’s illumination  Figure 7.27 .  Figure 7.27: Dipole-like Tags Aligned to Reader Polarization are Read; Tags Orthogonal to Reader Polarization are not.  As a consequence, long thin tag antennas must be aligned with the polarization of the reader antenna in order to be read. This can be managed in several ways:    Orientation control: a linearly-polarized reader antenna can be used if the tags are  always oriented with their long axes along the direction of polarization, or if the reader antenna can be physically rotated to achieve this alignment.    Circular polarization: a circularly-polarized reader antenna will interact with tags in any orientation in the plane perpendicular to the tag-reader line. Circularly-polarized  330   Tag Antennas  radiation will also read tags that are aligned along the direction of propagation  and thus invisible when placed directly in front of the antenna , if the objects to which the tags are attached move across the read zone, so that they can be seen from varying angles.   Dual-dipole or polarization-diverse tag antennas: an antenna structure with elong- ated features in orthogonal, or nearly-orthogonal, directions, will interact with electric ﬁelds in any direction in the plane of the antenna  Figure 7.28 .  Figure 7.28: Dual-dipole Tags are More Tolerant of Polarization Variations.  Orientation control is the simplest means of dealing with polarization, but it is often not prac- tical. As we noted in Chapter 5, antennas that are circularly polarized in the center of their beam may be linear or nearly so in directions away from the beam direction; in addition, ellipticity often increases towards the edges of the operating frequency band. Dual-dipole antenna designs provide the most robust means of obtaining tags that can be read irrespective of the direction of polarization. Note, however, that to make use of such a capability requires that the tag IC have two independently-rectiﬁed inputs. If one simply combines the received signals from two diff- erent antennas and rectiﬁes the sum, the result is a polarization-sensitive antenna, albeit the optimal direction may be in between the directions in which the physical arms actually point. If, on the other, each signal is separately rectiﬁed and the resulting DC power is added, the total received power varies only slightly with the direction of the electric ﬁeld. This requires a chip with at least three contact pads instead of two, and some additional area for a second charge pump and associated circuitry. The antenna structure is also necessarily larger for the same antenna performance. As a consequence, dual dipole tags are always somewhat more expensive than single-dipole tags of similar capabilities. One should also recall that dual-dipole tags should not be used with circularly polarized monostatic antennas: the returned signal from a symmetrically-illuminated tag will be of the reverse polarization sense, and will be received  331   Chapter 7  poorly by the transmitting antenna. Bistatic readers account for this problem by using a pair of oppositely polarized antennas for transmit and receive functions.  7.3.7 Radar Scattering Cross-Section  As we discussed in some detail in Chapter 5, tags communicate with a reader by varying the amount of power they scatter back to the reader antenna. The amount of power backscattered by an antenna is usually described using the concept of a cross-section. A scattering cross-section is deﬁned as the ratio of the power radiated by the tag to the power density incident on it. The cross-section measured from the same direction as the incident radiation—the backscattered power—is usually known as the radar scattering cross-section  RCS , since a radar receiver, like an RFID reader, looks for signals scattered back to the transmit location.  The radar scattering cross-section is composed of several familiar pieces. The power received by a matched antenna is the product of the incident power density and the effective aperture of the antenna, and the effective aperture is just the product of the antenna gain and the aperture of an ideal isotropic antenna, which is proportional to the square of the wavelength. In our simple equivalent circuit model, the power radiated by the tag is just the power dissipated by the radiation resistance. The radiated power in the incident direction is then increased over the isotropic value by the gain, so the gain multiplies the result twice  going in and going out . The result is:   cid:6  cid:6  cid:6  cid:6   Asc = λ2 4π  G2  2 Rrad  Zload + Zant   cid:6  cid:6  cid:6  cid:6 2   7.19   Thus the radar scattering cross-section is determined by the antenna gain, and the ratio of the radiation resistance to the total load impedance. For a resonant dipole with a matched load, the radar scattering cross-section is about 220 cm2. When instead a short is presented to the antenna, the current doubles relative to the matched load so the scattered power increases fourfold: the RCS is about 880 cm2. Note that these cross-sections are greatly in excess of the physical cross-section of the wire  typically around 1 or 2 cm2 for a thin wire dipole . The identiﬁcation of the cross-section with the physical extent of the antenna is reasonable for antennas that are several wavelengths in extent, like a parabolic dish, but is fundamentally incorrect for wire-like antennas. In our simpliﬁed equivalent circuit, no current ﬂows when an open circuit is present at the load, the radar cross-section falls to 0. In reality, a much smaller current ﬂows along each segment of the antenna, limited by the high capacitive impedance of the segments, and the radar cross-section is ﬁnite but small.  The scattering cross-section of a matched antenna depends only on the wavelength and the gain, and for the small antennas used in tags, gain is at most about that of a dipole  2.2 dBi . So in  332   Tag Antennas  principle, the scattering cross-section of a tag could be nearly independent of the size. However, very small antennas have high reactive impedances and small radiation resistances—that is, high Q values—so the bandwidth over which large RCS is obtained will be reduced relative to a larger antenna. Real antennas will also face reduced radiative efﬁciency due to ohmic losses, which we have neglected for simplicity in most cases. Ohmic losses are of course particularly signiﬁcant for antennas fabricated using printed conductive ink, which is less conductive than pure metal layers.  We examined the problem of modulating the backscattered power from the point of view of the IC in Chapter 5. Reactive modulation  changing the load reactance rather than the load imped- ance  produces the best compromise between power delivered to the load and backscatter modulation. The backscattered signal in this case is roughly proportional to the unmodulated signal. Thus, the best reverse-link performance ought to be obtained from tags with large radar cross-sections, and the most robust reverse-link performance when the RCS is large over a broad band. Of course, as we discussed in Chapter 3, tags will often be forward-link-limited. In general a tag with a lower radar cross-section is receiving less power, though the absorbed power falls less rapidly than the scattered power as the load resistance increases; tags with small RCS may become reverse-link limited.  Some measured data for commercial tags mounted on paper is summarized in Figure 7.29. The general trends are as we might expect: the largest values are intermediate between those of a matched load and a shorted dipole. Larger tags have larger scattering cross-sections over a broader frequency band. The compact Rafsec and Alien tags   d  and  e  in the Figure  have small RCS values. The very compact, heavily meandered  f  has a measured RCS of only a few square cm; it seems likely that this tag has reduced radiative efﬁciency due to long thin lines, as well as high Q, and is only well-matched on certain substrates.  Figure 7.29: Measured Unmodulated Radar Scattering Cross-section for Several Commercial Tag Designs.  333   Chapter 7  We are now  ﬁnally!  equipped to return to the question of backscatter modulation efﬁciency in the context of a realistically matched antenna. Let us consider a matched antenna equipped with a modulation transistor that can short out the IC load to modulate the backscattered signal  at the cost of loss of power to the IC during this time . How is the radar scattering cross-section affected? For some plausible parameter values, the two possible states are summarized in Figure 7.30. The radar cross-section of the matched antenna  case  a  of the Figure  is given by equation  7.19  with Zant + Zload = 2 Rrad: that is,  Asc = λ2 4π  G2.  The difference between the matched and modulated states is:   cid:2    cid:6  cid:6  cid:6  cid:6 50  ΔAmod = λ2 4π  G2  −  1 50  1  25− j35   cid:3  cid:6  cid:6  cid:6  cid:6 2 ≈ λ2  4π  G2 · 1.02.  Thus the scattered signal will be about half the power delivered to a matched load—a similar result to that we obtained without the matching network—though in this case the modulation is   7.20    7.21   Figure 7.30: Example of Load Modulation with Antenna Matching. a  IC Matched to Antenna. b  IC Shorted Out by Modulation Transistor.  334   Tag Antennas  basically phase-shift keying rather than amplitude-shift keying. Of course, the IC power falls by 3 dB since the IC is shorted half the time.  What about the case where the reactance of the load is modulated? Let’s assume that we add 10j Ω to the IC load above in the unmodulated state  inducing a slight mismatch  and subtract 10j Ω from the load above in the modulated state  a total of 20j change . The math is a bit ugly here so let’s just quote the results: the backscattered modulated signal power is about 17% of the available power, while the power delivered to the load is decreased by only about 8%.  The complex current ﬂowing through the antenna radiation resistance is shown in Figure 7.31. Note here that the current ﬂowing in the unmodulated case is the distance from the point  0,0   not shown in the ﬁgure for clarity . Thus, it’s easy to see that the backscattered current between the shorted and matched states  the 915 MHz points in  a   is about the same magnitude but differs in phase: ASK at the load has been converted to PSK at the antenna. When we vary the reactive part of the load, the result is to change the magnitude of the antenna current without changing its phase  the 915 MHz points in  b  : PSK at the load has been converted to ASK at the antenna. We can also see that shorting the load produces a strongly frequency-dependent backscattered signal magnitude with a large backscattered signal at the high end of the band, whereas varying the reactance gives a signal that varies little over most of the band.

So, in summary, PSK at the chip sacriﬁces about 5 dB of backscattered signal power vs. ASK at the chip, while improving the forward link budget by about 2.5 dB. One may reasonably expect to achieve around −5 dB modulation efﬁciency with very little impact on the forward-link- limited range, justifying the guesses we made in Chapter 3.  335   Chapter 7  7.4 Tags and the  local  Environment  7.4.1 Nearby Objects  Tags are usually attached to the object they purport to identify. If the object has signiﬁcant effe- cts on electromagnetic ﬁelds, the operation of the tag antenna is likely to be affected.  In supply-chain applications, tags will typically be embedded in a paper or plastic label and placed on a cardboard box. Boxes vary from about 3 mm to 1 cm thick, and are composed of thin sheets of paper and adhesive. Dry paper has a relative dielectric constant of around 3; a thin sheet of paper close to the tag will slightly increase the capacitance of the antenna and have little effect on the inductance. The consequent shift of a few percent in resonant frequency is unlikely to affect most tags signiﬁcantly, except for very small tags with high-Q antennas  due to low radiation resistance .  Some other common substrates, like glass, have somewhat higher dielectric constants  in this case typically 4.5 to 7  and will have a signiﬁcant effect on the tag antenna capacitance. Tags are designed to operate when placed directly on a thick glass substrate by targeting the match- ing circuitry assuming this enhanced capacitance, which is not present when the glass is missing; such tags may work very well directly on thick glass but read poorly in air or on low-dielectric-constant materials.  Water and metals are a different story. Water is composed of highly polar molecules: the oxygen atom takes electron density from the hydrogens, becoming negatively charged and leaving them with a signiﬁcant positive charge. The molecules try to orient themselves to cancel any imposed electric ﬁeld, and do a distressingly good job of it: the dielectric constant of water is around 80 at room temperature. Water molecules also form transient ring-like structures in liquid water, which break apart and reform on about a nanosecond timescale. As a consequence, water is strong absorber as well, with an absorption coefﬁ- cient of about 5 Np m or about 40 dB m, at 900 MHz. Absorption increases rapidly with frequency, and decreases with increasing temperature. Thus water is a strong reﬂector and absorber of microwave radiation, and substances that contain lots of water  like just about everything we eat, drink, or clean with  are also active at microwave frequencies.   Just for completeness, we take a moment to debunk a persistent misunderstanding: despite the fact that microwave ovens do work by heating liquid water, liquid water does not have any resonant behavior around 2.45 GHz—that’s just an available frequency for industrial use. The molecules in the liquid are too closely coupled to display any sharp resonances at all. Isolated water molecules in air have fundamental rotational frequencies in the hundreds of GHz; there is a transition between two excited rotational states at around 22 GHz.   336   Tag Antennas  Because of the high dielectric constant of water, the electric ﬁeld inside the water is greatly reduced. The value of the electric ﬁeld just outside the water and just inside of it must be continuous, so the only way to manage both requirements is to have the electric ﬁeld also be small just outside the water. We can’t arrange the ﬁeld to be small if there is only an incident wave, but adding a reﬂected wave does the trick if the reﬂected electric ﬁeld is in the opposite direction and nearly as large as the incident wave  Figure 7.32 .  As we move away from the water interface, the relative phase of the transmitted and reﬂec- ted waves changes, because they are moving in opposite directions: standing waves result  Figure 7.33 . A quarter of a wavelength from the surface, the two ﬁelds point in the same  Figure 7.32: Relationships Among the Incident, Transmitted, and Reﬂected Waves at an Air-water Interface.  337   Chapter 7  Figure 7.33: A Standing Wave Forms Near a Reﬂecting Interface, Causing Variations in Field Stren- gth and Received Power with Position.  direction instead of opposing one another, and they add to create a larger ﬁeld than was present with no water surface. At a half-wavelength from the surface another null occurs.  A wire-like tag antenna will experience a reduced electric ﬁeld as it nears an aqueous surface. In equivalent-circuit terms, the open-circuit voltage will fall when the distance to the interface is less than about 1 8 wavelength  4 cm or so . Thus, the received power delivered to a ﬁxed load also falls as the tag nears the interface.  Similar but more drastic effects occur when a tag is close to a metal interface. In this case the electric ﬁeld within the metal must go to exactly zero within a skin depth or two of the surface, so the reﬂected wave is of the same magnitude as the incident wave. For all common metals, the skin depth is a few microns to perhaps ten microns at 900 MHz, so the metal surface can be regarded as a perfect reﬂector for practical purposes. The electric ﬁeld will be proportional to the sine of the distance from the ground plane normalized to a half-wavelength, sin 4πh λ . Because the ﬁeld goes exactly to zero at this very sharp interface, we can view the problem  as long as we are on the “real” side of the ground plane  as equivalent to one in which the metal is removed, but an image of the antenna is placed behind the former surface by the same distance as the real antenna is above the surface. The image is exactly the same as the real antenna but with all currents and charges reversed, so that the ﬁelds go exactly to zero at the location where the metal was  Figure 7.34 .  338   Tag Antennas  Figure 7.34: When Viewed from the Real-Antenna Side, an Antenna Near a Metal Surface is Equiv- alent to an Antenna and its Image with No Metal.  When we view this antenna from far away, the potential that reaches us from the current on the real antenna is partially cancelled by the oppositely directed potential from the image. If the two antennas were in the same place  h = 0  cancellation would be exact and there would be no radiation. When the displacement is small compared to a wavelength, the net radiated ﬁeld is proportional to  h λ , and the power goes as the square of this quantity. For larger displacements, the power radiated perpendicular to the ground plane will be proportional to sin2 4πh λ , and thus very roughly we’d expect the radiation resistance to scale with the square of the sine  ignoring radiation pattern changes . Thus, the open-circuit voltage  pro- portional to electric ﬁeld  and the radiation resistance both should fall rather rapidly to 0 as the tag antenna approaches within about 1 8 of a wavelength  <4 cm  of the metal surface.  Capacitance and inductance of the antenna are also affected by the presence of the image dipole, though the exact behavior is rather dependent on the antenna shape. The inductance and capacitance of a wire scale roughly as the logarithm of the ratio of length to radius, ln L a . The relative effect of a neighboring wire is roughly proportional to the log of the ratio of length to spacing, here ln L 2h . Thus as long as ln h a  is large compared to 1, self-inductance and capacitance dominate, but when the separation from the ground plane is only a few times larger than the width or radius of the wires, the inductance falls and the capacitance increases. A non- resonant antenna with a matching network designed for speciﬁc values of reactance will deliver less power to the IC as these component values change, even if the resonant frequency of the antenna is relatively unaffected. This is known as detuning of the antenna. Detuning is of particular importance when a high-Q, narrow-bandwidth antenna is used.  339   Chapter 7  The measured radiation resistance of some simple copper-ribbon antennas near a ground plane is shown in Figure 7.35. It is generally clear that radiation resistance falls rapidly as the antenna nears the ground plane, though there is some scatter near zero, due to the difﬁculty of accurately locating the ground plane and accurately measuring very small radiation resistance values.  Figure 7.35: Measured Radiation Resistance at 1 GHz for a 5-cm-high Monopole near a Ground Plane; Note Equivalent Dipole Resistance is Twice the Value Shown Here. The Lines are a Sinusoi- dal Model Fit to the Peak Value of the Data.  The inductance and capacitance for the same monopoles near a ground plane are shown in Figures 7.36 and 7.37. The inductance ﬂuctuates rather gradually with distance, with nothing very drastic happening even at close spacings, as one might expect from the funda- mentally logarithmic scaling of inductance. The capacitance is roughly constant until the ground-plane separation approaches about 2–3 times the width of the antenna, and then increases rapidly due to the parallel-plate capacitance between the monopole and its image.  Using the data above, we can infer behavior of a tag matched with the approach discussed in Section 3.2 above. For example, we can match the 1.5-cm dipole antenna with a shunt inductance of about 9 nH and a series inductance of 38 nH to a plausible IC load  15− j300 Ω . We can then modify the equivalent circuit parameters of the antenna to reﬂect the presence of the ground plane, using the data in Figures 7.35–7.37, and note the behavior  340   Tag Antennas  Figure 7.36: Series Inductance for Copper Ribbon Monopoles Near a Ground Plane; Note Equiva- lent Dipole Inductance is Twice the Value Shown Here. The Lines are Cubic Polynomial Fits to the Data.  of the voltage delivered to the load.  Since the matching inductors are realized as lines on the antenna, one also ought to allow them to vary, but as we saw the relative inductance variations are modest for narrow lines so we will ignore this effect for simplicity.  The results of such a simulation exercise are summarized in Figure 7.38. The frequency at which the maximum voltage is delivered to the load, denoted the best match frequency, decreases rather slowly until the antenna approaches within 1 cm of the ground plane. Since the bandwidth is more than 50 MHz, the slow drift has essentially no effect on the voltage on the load. Nevertheless, the load voltage falls as the antenna approaches the ground plane, due mainly to the decrease in the open-circuit voltage from the reduced electric ﬁeld. Some experimental data is shown for tags with antennas that are about 9× 2.5 cm  circles  and 9× 2 cm  diamonds ; the measured read range qualitatively agrees with that predicted from the simple circuit model, although the smaller tag does particularly well at small tag-metal spacings.  Is it possible to construct a tag antenna that will work within a few millimeters of a metal? Fortunately, the answer is yes, and indeed we have already encountered one structure: the patch antenna  Figure 7.39 . The patch antenna works by performing an impedance transformation.  341   Chapter 7  Figure 7.37: Series Capacitance for Copper Ribbon Monopoles Near a Ground Plane; Note Equiv- alent Dipole Capacitance is Half the Value Shown Here. The Lines are Fits to a Simple End-Charge Model.  In the center of the patch, large currents ﬂow; the radiation from these currents is almost perfectly cancelled by the image patch, so for a given current density the radiated electric ﬁeld is relatively small. A large current and small radiation resistance combine to create an accept- able radiated ﬁeld. At the edge of the patch, the current falls nearly to zero and a large voltage is maintained between the patch and the ground plane: the small impedance has been transformed to a much larger one, much more appropriate for the relatively high-impedance tag IC input. Adding microstrip tuning structures, or recessing the feed point, can be used to match the patch impedance to the tag.  However, recall that a typical reader antenna with robust bandwidth for operation in the 900 MHz region used on the order of a 1 cmpatch-ground spacing h.This is hardly practical for a tag! If we make a tag patch antenna that is of a thickness acceptable for most applications—say h = 0.5 mm—the bandwidth of the antenna will be only a few MHz, making it unacceptable for use in the United States and other countries with wide operating bands available, and unlikely to be robust to small variations in spacing and dimensions even when only a few MHz of band- width is available for a reader. Very thin patch antennas are not practical, so patch-antenna- based tags are only a good solution when a relatively thick tag is acceptable. A single-ended  342   Tag Antennas  Figure 7.38: Modeled Frequency for Best Matching, and Relative Voltage to the IC Load at 915 MHz, as a 1.5-cm Ribbon Dipole Approaches a Ground Plane. Also Shown are Measured Relative Read Ranges for Two Commercial Tags with Ribbon-like Antennas.  Figure 7.39: Patch Antenna Conﬁgured to Drive an IC. Matching Structures may also be Incorporated Using Microstrip.  patch antenna like this also requires a connection from the metal patch level to the ground plane, so that we can connect the IC: this can be a via hole or a wraparound connection on the side of the dielectric. Both are relatively expensive to fabricate. A patch antenna tag requires a relatively thick dielectric, two metal layers, patterning of the top layer, and interlayer  343   Chapter 7  connections, and will never be as cheap as a conventional tag antenna. We can avoid the need for a via hole by instead fabricating a patch dipole, where the IC sits between two half-wave patches, but at the cost of a larger structure. Various approaches have been explored to create compact, broadband patch antennas; more details may be found in the references cited in Further Reading below.  It is also possible to construct a conventional matching network for a tag near a ground plane. For example, we can use the same shunt series inductive matching we have used before with small values of radiation resistance, though of course the effects of the image antenna must be considered in estimating the inductance of the short lines used for matching. However, the same conundrum applies: the radiation resistance falls rapidly as the gap decreases, whereas the reac- tances change rather slowly. Thus the Q of the antenna goes up, and the bandwidth goes down.  In addition, any structure that is designed to operate in close proximity to a metal surface will work poorly when separated from its ground plane. A half-wave patch suspended in air would be a perfectly-good antenna if conﬁgured as a dipole with the IC and matching structures in the center, but makes a rather poor monopole connected to an IC at one end. Therefore, a patch antenna tag that is to be readable on its own should incorporate a ground plane on the back.  In practice, many tags, especially broadband designs with low Q, can be placed within about 1–2 cm of a metal surface before severe performance degradation sets in. Some tags achieve about ½ of their free-space range as close as 5 mm to a metal surface. When it is practical to use thick spacers of foam plastic or similar materials, tags can be readily attached to metal surfaces. Large metal pieces can also be tagged by hanging the tags by a wire or string so that they are spaced away from the metal. Tags can be mounted on spring-loaded supports so that they pop out perpendicular to the metal surface when enough space is available, but can be pressed back against the surface when height is at a premium.  When cartons containing RF-active materials such as water or metallized-plastic packaging are to be marked, it is often possible to ﬁnd one or more locations on the surface of the cardboard carton where the spacing between the antenna and the reﬂective substances is large enough to allow operation, or even enhance it  if the separation approaches ¼ wavelength . The empirical task of discovering such favored placements is known as hot-spot testing, and requires that tag readability be tested by variations in reader power or range as the tag is shifted to all the plausible locations on a box.  Another approach to tagging metallic surfaces is to create or exploit discontinuities in the metal surface. As we described above, a continuous metal surface forces all electric ﬁelds to 0. How- ever, most metal surfaces are not continuous. Metals may have holes, slots, recesses, and other structures. These discontinuities cause currents to be displaced and charges to accumulate  344   Tag Antennas  within the metal, and electric ﬁelds to be present within the features. It is possible to attach conventional tags to span slots or holes in a metal surface and capacitively couple to the induced potentials, thus obtaining tag reads without an objectionably thick tag antenna structure, but the application must allow an appropriate slot or other discontinuity to be present in the metal piece.  7.4.2 Nearby Tags  Currents ﬂow in tag antennas to ensure that the electric ﬁeld in the metal—which is the sum of the incident electric ﬁeld from e.g. a reader antenna and the scattered ﬁelds from the currents and charges—is zero, except at the metal surface. The same currents and charges also affect the electric ﬁelds in the nearby world, including the ﬁelds on other tag antennas.  When two tag antennas are placed very close to and parallel to one another, the structure becomes very similar to the folded dipole antenna we studied in Section 7.3.5 above, with one important distinction: the ends are generally not connected together. The structure looks like a transmission line with an open-circuited end. If the antennas are a half-wave long or nearly so, the open-circuit load at the end of the transmission line is transformed into a short- circuit at the center of the line by the quarter wave length of transmission line formed by the two wires. This is a big problem: the transmission line  composed of the two antennas  short-circuits any voltage that either individual dipole antenna may develop due to an incident ﬁeld. The result, that overlapped tag antennas cannot be read, is often somewhat erroneously explained by assuming that the tags compete for the incident power.  Even when tags are seemingly distant from one another, interaction effects can be substantial. An important and particularly simple case to analyze is the case of a plane of tags illuminated in the plane. In this simple geometry, tags effectively cast shadows on the tags behind them. The shadows are not sharp as optical shadows are, but are broad and diffuse, extending laterally and growing deeper as more tags are added. Let us examine an example geometry in which a reader signal is sent to a linearly polarized receiving antenna  simulating what signal a tag would receive , with varying numbers and types of commercial tags placed in the plane between the transmitting  reader  antenna and the emulated tag  Figure 7.40 . Tags are spaced by 5 cm in depth and 20 cm laterally, so that the distance from the receiving antenna to the more distant tags, when many tags are present, is quite large compared to the size of a tag, and the interaction can no longer be regarded as purely local.  Some experimental results for this conﬁguration are shown in Figure 7.41. When no tags are present, the received signal is about −8 dBm  somewhat less than predicted from the Friis equation, due to several effects including antenna mismatch, transmit modulation, and cable loss . A column of six Alien Technology ‘Squiggle’ tags placed in front of the receiving antenna  345   Chapter 7  Figure 7.40: Experimental Setup for Characterizing Effects of In-plane Tags on Received Signal.  reduces the received power by 5 dB; a similar column of ‘I’ tags reduces received power by 10 dB  a factor of 10! .  These two tags are respectively the second right right and farthest left in Figure 7.29, so the Squiggle tag has a much smaller unmodulated radar cross-section than the I-tag.  When additional columns are added, the signal power is further reduced, even though these columns are not in the geometric line of sight between the two antennas. In the limit of a fully-populated array, the signal strength is reduced by about 18 dB. Since the total forward link budget  Section 3.6 of Chapter 3  is only about 40 to 45 dB, and path loss takes up around 25 dB at 1 m, this is a very substantial decrease in signal. It can be expected that tags at the back of such an in-plane array will be difﬁcult to read and this is found to be the case.  346   Tag Antennas  Figure 7.41: Measured Received Signal as a Function of Number of Rows and Columns in the Plane Populated with Tags, for Two Different Commercial Tag Designs.  When tag shadowing is signiﬁcant, strong collective effects can also result if all the tags modu- late their impedances together. This collective operation can occur with EPCglobal Class 0 tags during binary tree traversal, causing tags to mistake neighbor modulation effects for reader symbols.  The effects of scattering in such a geometry, in which the tags are more or less in the direction of propagation, is relatively simple to analyze because the ﬁelds from the transmitting antenna and from the tag antennas arrive more or less in phase. A tag near the reader antenna receives the reader signal just after it is launched, but the scattered wave from that tag has a long way to travel to reach the receiving antenna  or the tag in the back row . A tag in the back row receives the reader signal after a delay of several nanoseconds, but its scattered signal reaches the receiving antenna almost immediately  Figure 7.42 . The total time delay  transmitter ⇒ scattering tag ⇒ receiver  is approximately constant for all the scattering tags, so the scattered  347   Chapter 7  ﬁelds from all the tags can simply be added up, without much regard for the exact location of the tags doing the scattering.  Figure 7.42: Array of Tags Illuminated in Endﬁre, with Example Time Delays for Scattering from First and Penultimate Tags to the Final Tag in the Array.  As a consequence, we can construct a very simple model that captures the essential aspects of tag shadowing behavior. We assume n identical tags of length l are separated by a distance d. The current on each tag is the ratio of the local voltage  electric ﬁeld multiplied by half the tag length  to the impedance of the tag:  In = En cid:11 n 2 Zn  where  cid:11  is the element length.   7.22   We simplify the situation further by assuming that the current is constant along each tag and that only the electric ﬁeld due to the vector potential A is signiﬁcant; that is, we ignore any capacitive coupling between the tags. Finally, we use a key approximation due to Hill and Cha: we assume that for the purpose of calculating the current in the last tag of the array, the current on all the other tags has the same magnitude, and that the phase differs by exactly the difference in the phase of the incident wave. In forward scattering, this means that all the vector potentials simply add in phase. The electric ﬁeld is thus:  En = Einc − j  Iant = En cid:11 n 2 Zn  ωμ0 cid:11 Iant  1 ∑ 4π nd n ωμ0 cid:11 2 Einc cid:11  − j 4 π 2 Zn  =  nIant  1 nd  ∑ n  .  348   7.23    We can solve for the current:  2 Iant Zn = Einc  cid:11  − j  cid:2  ωμ0  cid:11 2 4π ∑  2Zn + j  Iant  n   cid:2   Iant =  2Zn + j  ωμ0  cid:11 2   cid:3  nIant 4π ∑  n  1 nd  1 nd n Einc  cid:11  ωμ0  cid:11 2  n  4π  = Einc  cid:11    cid:3  .  1 nd  ∑ n  Iant =   cid:2   cid:2   =   cid:3   Einc  cid:11  μ0c 2π 4π λ Einc  cid:11   cid:11  Z0 λ 2   cid:11  d  n ∑  cid:11 2  1 nd  n   cid:3   1 n  ∑ n  2Zn + j  2Zn + j  Tag Antennas   7.24    7.25   We can rewrite this expression in a more physically appealing form using ω = ck:  where Z0 is the impedance of free space, 377 Ω. The current ﬂowing in the last tag in the array is the ratio of the incident voltage to a modiﬁed impedance composed of the impedance of the tag and a mutual inductance from the other tags. Since the impedance of the tag antenna Zn is not necessarily purely real but could be capacitive or inductive  i.e. it could have a positive or negative imaginary part , the total impedance could be larger or smaller than the tag impedance, so that either shadowing or focusing could result from such an endﬁre array.  Let’s look at some typical values. Assume six tags are 14 cm long and spaced 5 cm apart, and illuminated at around 915 MHz, and that an isolated tag is tuned to resonance with an input resistance of 60 Ω  twice Rrad . We get:  Iant =  Einc  cid:11   =  Einc  cid:11    120 + j190 0.4  2.8  2.3     120 + j510    7.26   The induced current is reduced by about a factor of 5 versus an isolated antenna: shadowing has resulted. Since this is the current into a ﬁxed tag impedance, the power is decreased by about a factor of 25 or about 14 dB, in good agreement with the results of Figure 7.41 given the simpli- city of the approximations.  The dependence of the shadow depth on the array also depends on the impedance of the tag. If the individual tag impedance is large and capacitive  as is the case for an antenna that is signiﬁ- cantly shorter than resonance and not fully matched , then the mutual impedance of the other  349   Chapter 7  tags in the array, which is inductive, will subtract from the local impedance and the array will actually increase the current instead of shadowing it. This is more or less how a Yagi-Uda array works. On the other hand, an inductive tag impedance will add to the mutual inductance of the nearby coupled tags, and shadowing will occur even for small mutual inductance  one or two rows of tags .  The situation is substantially more complicated when the paths of the scattered waves are not in the same direction as the incident waves. An example of a geometry where phase must be accounted for is shown in Figure 7.43. When arrays of tags are placed in planes perpendicular to the direction of propagation, the path length from the reader antenna to a receiving tag is no longer similar to the path length from the reader antenna to a scattering tag and back to the receiving tag. For example, waves scattered from the back plane of tags travel farther to get to the front plane than a wave transmitted from the reader antenna, the difference being roughly twice the interplane gap  once for the reader signal to reach the back plane, and again to return to the front plane . In consequence, as the gap is changed, the scattered signals from the back  Figure 7.43: Tags Arranged in Planes Perpendicular to the Direction of Propagation.  350   Tag Antennas  plane could arrive in phase with signals from the reader, increasing the total signal and making it easier to read the tags in the front, or they could arrive out of phase, making it harder to read the tags in the front plane. For those tags far from the center of the array, the lateral distance must also be taken into account. Therefore, in this geometry we would not expect a simple monotonic change in readability but an oscillatory behavior as scattered waves move into and out of phase with the incident waves.  Some experimental data in this conﬁguration is depicted in Figure 7.44. This particular experi- ment employed commercial tags  Alien ‘Squiggle’ class 1 Generation 1  and a commercial reader  WJ Communications MPR5000  running a class 1 anti-collision algorithm. It is readily apparent that the number of tags read in both planes varies signiﬁcantly depending on the interplane gap, with a periodicity of about ½ of a wavelength. This is the same periodicity we discussed in connection with reﬂection from a high-dielectric or conducting surface  Figure 7.33 . Conﬁgurations of this type can arise when stacks of identical cartons containing  Figure 7.44: Experimental Data for Tag Reads Using Commercial  ‘Squiggle’ class 1  Tags. In this Test 27 Tags were Placed in the Front Plane and 18 in the Back Plane, and a 1 2-watt Commercial Reader was Used.  351   Chapter 7  RF-transparent materials, identically tagged, are constructed for transport on a pallet. In this case, the read performance in a given geometry will be a sensitive function of not only the tag orientation and tag type, but also the carton size.  What measures can be taken to mitigate tag scattering effects? The simplest approach is to use tags with reduced scattering cross-sections. For example, the variation in readability as a function of interplane gap seen above is exacerbated when I-tags, with a higher scattering cross-section, are substituted for Squiggle tags; Squiggle tags are better choices for an array of tags. A low scattering cross-section will result if the effective load resistance greatly exceeds the radiation resistance. Since the scattered power decreases roughly as the square of the load resistance, but the load power decreases only linearly, substantial reductions in scattering can be achieved with modest effects on forward-link-limited range; see Turner in Further Reading for more details.  A more complex approach is to reduce tag scattering only after a tag has been read. This requires that the tag IC present a switchable load to the antenna, and furthermore that the IC maintain a switched state for some time after power is removed  since little power is received when the tag is in the low-scattering state . This approach has been described by Kruest, and an alternative implementation suited for shunt-matched tags has been advanced by the current author.  7.5 Near-ﬁeld and Hybrid Tag Antennas  We have previously described near-ﬁeld UHF operation: conﬁgurations in which coupling between the reader and tag antennas is dominated by inductive rather than radiative coupling. In discussing reader antenna design for this application, we found that only very small reader antennas, with consequent short read range, can operate without signiﬁcant radiation.  Nearﬁeld tags are often directed towards applications where the size of the tag antenna is highly constrained. In this case, a simple loop antenna can be used. The loop antenna’s radiation resistance falls as the fourth power of the radius when the loop is small compared to a wavelength  Figure 7.45 : that is, small loops do not radiate and by reciprocity don’t receive radiation either. A tag loop antenna less than about 2 cm in diameter will couple only inductively even if the reader antenna radiates substantial power.  A simple loop antenna has a parallel resonance at a circumference of about 0.45 wavelength, which at 915 MHz is a diameter of about 5 cm. For diameters much smaller than this, the loop looks like simple inductive load. The inductance of a simple loop of radius R and wire radius a is roughly:  352   Tag Antennas  Figure 7.45: Radiation Resistance of a Loop Antenna vs. Diameter at 915 MHz.   cid:2    cid:3   R a   cid:11  ≈ μ0R ln  ;  for  = 20,  R a   cid:11   nH  ≈ 38 · R  cm  .   7.27   Thus, a loop with a radius of 1.6 cm has an inductance of around 60 nH and will resonate with a typical IC load. Smaller loops may use feed lines to add some inductance.  As we have seen previously  Figures 7.19 and 7.20 , shunt series inductance matching structures for dipole-like antennas are often convenient to implement as a tapped loop. In many cases the loop is of a reasonable size and conﬁguration to act as a near-ﬁeld antenna. Tags of this type will couple inductively to an inductive reader antenna, using the center loop, and radiatively to a conventional antenna using the dipole. Such antennas can be regarded as hybrid near far-ﬁeld antennas. One can use a loop match along with a densely-meandered dipole-like antenna to make a very compact hybrid tag; performance in far-ﬁeld applications is compromised but acceptable for some uses.  353   Chapter 7  Figure 7.46: Examples of Near-ﬁeld, Compact Hybrid, and Conventionally-sized Hybrid Tags.  7.6 Capsule Summary  In order to transfer the maximum amount of power from antenna to IC, the antenna and IC should have the same resistance, and the reactance  usually capacitive  of the IC must be matched by some inductance from the antenna. When the IC and antenna are conjugate- matched, the power transfer coefﬁcient is 1 and the received power is described by the Friis equation. Although the most accurate representation of the IC input is as a parallel resis- tance and capacitance, it is often convenient to transform the load to the equivalent series resistance, usually around 10–20 Ω, and capacitance, about 0.5 to 1 pF. A key goal of antenna design is to match the antenna output to this impedance. A byproduct is some reactive ampliﬁcation of the antenna open-circuit voltage, highly beneﬁcial in supplying  354   Tag Antennas  enough voltage to turn on the rectifying diodes in the IC input, but high voltage ampliﬁcation is accompanied by bandwidth reductions.  Many tag antennas are variations of a dipole. A resonant dipole is too big for most passive tag applications and doesn’t provide a good conjugate match to an IC. Many tricks are used for ﬁtting a big antenna into a small space. The antenna can be bent to reduce its length; an antenna with multiple bends meanders back and forth. Meandered antennas can ﬁt into small spaces but require considerably more wire length than a straight antenna. A meandered antenna longer than resonant length looks inductive and can match a capacitive load. Short antennas can be matched using a shunt inductor fabricated as a length of conductive line between the two halves of the dipole. Adding extra conductor width, in the form of a disk or other ﬂared shape, to the end of a dipole lowers its resonant frequency. The whole antenna can be made fatter; as the aspect ratio of an antenna goes down, so does the quality factor, albeit only at a logarithmic rate. The dipole can be rolled around at the ends to make a folded dipole with a higher source impedance.  Tags reply to readers by backscattering. The amount of power they scatter depends on the modulated radar scattering cross section. The scattering cross section is not determined by the physical cross-sectional area of the antenna but by the wavelength, gain, and impedances of antenna and load.  Tag antennas can be detuned when they are placed on typical dielectrics like glass, though the consequences are reduced if the tag has broad bandwidth. Metal and aqueous ﬂuids cause bigger problems, by driving the electric ﬁeld  and thus the radiation resistance  to zero or a small value at the interface. A tag antenna that works in air will work poorly very close to a metal surface and vice versa.  Tag antennas will also interact with each other. When an array is dense in the direction of propagation, tags in the rear of the array are shadowed and difﬁcult to read. In more complex arrays, scattering can add to or subtract from the incident wave, so that results may behave in an oscillatory fashion with changes in array spacing.  UHF tags can be conﬁgured to couple only inductively by using a small loop antenna instead of a dipole. Tags with both dipole and loop structures in their antennas can couple to a conventional radiated signal or an inductive reader antenna.  7.7 Further Reading  “Folded dipole antenna near metal plate”, P.

A new tag IC from the Silicon Valley startup company Fundless Networks is  reported to consume a DC power of 0.3 μW at an input voltage of 0.5 V. Treat the IC load as a simple parallel resistor and ﬁnd the resistance value: Rp =  ohms  The input capacitance is 0.5 pF. What are the series equivalent input circuit values at 915 MHz? RS =  ohms CS  pF  What is the voltage ampliﬁcation factor for a conjugate-matched antenna  Rrad = Rload ? VIC Voc =  Assume the input capacitance was matched using a simple series inductor, and that the antenna looks like a voltage source and radiation resistance matched to the load series resistance. What is the bandwidth of the overall antenna-IC circuit? BW =  MHz  What is the voltage multiplication factor at the band edge at 902 MHz? VIC Voc =  7.2. After sitting through three hours of PowerPointless slides and a lunch whose fat cont- ent is measured in ounces rather than grams, Bob the lazy RF designer snags a proto- type IC from Fundless’ VP of Sales, Sal E. Closer. Being Bob, he doesn’t want to design a matched antenna and instead simply attaches the IC to the 915-MHz resonant dipole antenna he took from Amy’s desk  see Figure 7.9 . What is the power transfer coefﬁcient? τ =  at 900 MHz  Should this be Bob’s raise at his next performance review?  357   Chapter 7  7.3. Consider the matching problem shown below.

If the lines used in the tag antenna are 0.2 cm wide, how long is the shunt inductor?  length =  nH  Repeat the exercise for the series inductor, remembering that the physical implementation will split this into two series inductors with the IC between them:  inductance =  nH length =  cm  358   Tag Antennas  Radar Scattering Cross-Section:  7.4. A tag is placed in an anechoic  reﬂection-free  chamber, 1.25 m from a linearly- polarized test antenna with a gain of 4 at 915 MHz. The transmitted signal is 10 dBm. The measured reﬂected signal, corrected for antenna reﬂections, is −50 dBm. What is the radar cross-section of the tag? RCS =  cm2  Metal Surfaces:  7.5. The tag of problem  3  is to be used mounted on the bottom of a metal car body using a 5-mm-thick foam spacer. Near the metal surface, the series model of the antenna becomes 1.5 pF and 10 nH in series with 1 Ω. The open-circuit voltage is reduced from its value in the open by 2 sin 2π 0.5 8.2  = 0.19.

A communications protocol must address questions like:    Medium: what is the medium by which messages are to be exchanged? People use  the media of speech, writing, and pantomime to communicate directly with each other. Machine-to-machine communication can be based on electrical signals carried by a cable, light in a silica ﬁber, ultrasound, or radio waves.    Message format: speech can be formatted in English, Swedish, Japanese, Hindi, or any of the wonderful panoply of languages that have arisen over the millennia since humans invented the ability to harangue their spouses. Each language has a vocabu- lary of phonemes and words and a grammar describing how these elements are to be combined.    Medium access: in some cases, a particular medium—a wire—is dedicated to a  particular communications process, and there is no possibility of contention, but many media are shared. The audible medium is shared when a group of people congregate to talk; some means must be arranged to allocate the medium so that individuals can be understood. In informal situations, a person usually waits until no one else is speaking and then attempts to talk; if they collide with another person with similar intent, both go silent and wait for a random time to try again. This scheme, dressed up as carrier-sense multiple access with collision detection, is the basis of the shared- medium part of Ethernet networking, used in almost every local area network in the world. When people gather in more formal settings, one individual may take control of the right to speak, and periodically poll the group for those who wish to take the ﬂoor, granting them rights as she sees ﬁt.    Context and interpretation: even if a message is received without error and the words  and sentences deciphered, the meaning of the contents must be established by reference to a context in which the exchange takes place.  361   Chapter 8  Each of these basic protocol elements must be deﬁned for any communications system and in particular, for any RFID system. The choices that are made in deﬁning an RFID protocol, and particularly a protocol meant to be implemented by passive tags, are shaped by the need to minimize the demands on the limited power and computational ability of the tags.  As we have previously noted, once one makes the choice of using radio communications, the means that can be used are heavily constrained by regulatory authorities. The designer is limited to speciﬁc frequency bands, maximum power levels, bandwidth, and channel residence within the bands. Key medium properties from an RF point of view are bandwidth, interference levels, propagation characteristics, antennas, and circuit requirements.  A medium-range UHF RFID protocol meant to operate in the United States doesn’t have too many choices. In most cases, operation will be in either the 902- to 928-MHz or 2.4- to 2.483-GHz unlicensed bands. The lower band defaults to 500 kHz channels and the upper to 1 MHz channels. Operation under European  ETSI  guidelines is a bit more complex but basically requires the reader to operate in 200 kHz channels between 865 and 868 MHz. Recall from Chapter 3 that the data capacity of a transmission channel is determined by the bandwidth and signal-to-noise ratio. A channel 500-kHz wide is sufﬁcient to provide for 1–200 kbps with no special measures, so either band is suitable for many RFID passive tag applications, which tend to be low rate, even using the inefﬁcient modulations that passive tags are stuck with. Both United States bands are exposed to interference from many existing unlicensed devices, including cordless telephones and wireless local-area networks, though the proliferation of WiFi and Bluetooth hardware in recent years makes the 2.4-GHz band a tougher interference environment. Many other sources of interference also exist, including intentional radiators in nearby bands  like cellular basestations  and unintentional radiators  like poorly grounded spark plugs . The properties of some of the sources likely to be encountered in the 902- to 928-MHz United States ISM band are summarized in Figure 8.1.  Other readers are a key source of interference in densely populated environments, as we noted in Chapter 6. In addition to the various physical conﬁguration solutions, protocols can make the reader interference problem loom smaller or larger, depending on the overlap of the spectrum of tag replies and reader transmission. If the two are kept separated in frequency, it may be possible to ﬁlter out other reader transmissions in the receiver and leave only the tags. This approach is used in EPCglobal Class 1 Generation 2 Dense- Interrogator operation  Section 8.5 of this Chapter .  Since passive RFID is a short-range technology, the propagation issues of interest mostly have to do with indoor propagation and obstacle tolerance. Radio waves can get through obstacles in three ways:  362   UHF RFID Protocols  Figure 8.1: Sources of Interference in the 900-MHz Band, and their General Properties.   Direct penetration: many dielectric materials, like dry paper or cardboard, dry wood, nonconductive plastics, most textiles, and glass, are substantially non absorbing and have modest refractive indices  2–4  for 900-MHz radio waves. Such materials are sometimes known as RF-lucent. Radiation incident on lucent materials suffers modest reﬂections due to refractive-index mismatch—a refractive index of 3 causes a loss of about 3 dB per interface. Absorption is negligible. So many common materials that are solid obstacles for visible light are of moderate to negligible consequence for 900-MHz radiation. In contrast, metals reﬂect essentially all the radiation that falls upon them. Water, with a dielectric constant of around 80, also reﬂects almost all of an incident wave and absorbs most of the rest. They are RF-opaque.    Diffraction: visible light has a wavelength of around 0.5 micron—about 1 2000 of a millimeter. Human-sized objects are thousands or millions of wavelengths across, so to use light seems to travel in straight lines. However, 900-MHz radio waves have a wavelength around 32 cm—the length of a piece of letter-sized paper.  363   Chapter 8  Typical indoor objects are only a few wavelengths across. RF-opaque objects still cast shadows, but they are diffuse and not monotonic. A typical object a few wave- lengths across casts a shadow about 10- to 15-dB deep, with a relatively shallow region—Poisson’s Bright Spot—roughly in the geometric center of the shadow.    Reﬂection: many objects in the indoor environment reﬂect radio waves. Dielectrics  like glass reﬂect modestly at perpendicular incidence but rather effectively at glancing angles  greater than about 70 degrees from the normal . Water and metal are excellent reﬂectors. Signals can bounce off a reﬂective object and illuminate a region that is shadowed from direct illumination by the reader antenna. Reﬂected waves add to or subtract from the direct wave from the reader antenna, causing the received signal strength to vary from place to place in a fashion that is complex and not readily predictable, even in a generally static environment. This variation is known as fading. Because of the limited link budget of RFID tags, RFID tags are usually close to and at least partially illuminated by the direct beam from the reader antenna, so fading is of less importance in RFID than in many other radio systems. However, it is still signiﬁcant. Reﬂections particularly from the ﬂoor cause read zones to be discontinuous, with tags read at  say  10 meters and not at 9. People are wonderful reﬂectors and will cause tags to be read or missed at the edge of the read zone as they move around, even when they are far from the direct beam from the reader antenna to the tag.  So the radio medium at 900 MHz is complex; communication may occur without a clear line of sight between tag and reader antenna, but the link can also fail sporadically. The protocol cannot assume a reliable and continuous connection, or simple monotonic changes in signal strength or link quality.  The use of 900-MHz radiation and unlicensed operation basically limit us to 6–10 dBi of reader antenna gain. Combined with the propagation difﬁculties alluded to above, the relatively broad beams created by such low-gain antennas imply that localizing an inquiry to any speciﬁc physical region will not be possible. Protocols must assume that any tags in a given general area will be illuminated; if only some of these tags are the object of a given inquiry, the protocol must provide means for addressing the inquiry only to the relevant subset.  The choices that a given protocol makes for each of the protocol elements collectively form an attempt to meet a number of contradictory requirements. Before plunging into an examination of how speciﬁc protocols work, let’s take a look at the tools a protocol designer has at hand and the tradeoffs they face in using those tools.  364   UHF RFID Protocols  Symbols and Modulation: Recall from Chapter 3 that to convey any information, a radio signal has to be modulated, and the translation between binary bits and a particular sequence of modulation constitutes the symbol vocabulary available on the channel. Passive tags have no means of extracting frequency or phase, so reader modulation is limited to changes in signal amplitude with time. Since the tag also extracts its power from the reader signal, whatever choice of modulations and encoding is used must ensure a high average reader transmit power over a time comparable to the time a tag can store energy. The desire to keep power high most of the time leads to symbol sets in which RF power is on except for small low-power gaps, and the desire to inventory tags rapidly means that the symbol duration is short, but the combination of these two circumstances implies that the spectrum of the transmitted signal is wide: typical passive reader symbols are very inefﬁcient users of bandwidth.  The reverse link from tag to reader, examined in some detail in Chapter 5, can use either amplitude or phase modulation at the tag but with no assurance that the corresponding change in the signal at the reader will be similar in nature. Increases in backscattered signal power may lead to a decreased reader signal; changes in phase at the tag may lead to changes in amplitude at the reader. Only the fact that a transition has occurred is likely to be detected reliably, so all tag encoding schemes must be variants of frequency-shift keying.  The spectrum of a frequency-shift-keyed signal generally peaks around the frequencies used. For example, if the tag can change its state either at 100 kHz or 200 kHz, the backscattered spectrum will have much of its energy in peaks displaced 100 and 200 kHz from the carrier; normally, both the sum and difference frequencies will be present, though their amplitude may vary depending on the  uncontrollable  phase relationships of the overall signal. As we noted in Chapter 4, one of the biggest challenges a reader faces in receiving a tag signal is the noise from its own signals, which is concentrated close to the carrier frequency. Therefore, there is some advantage to making the frequency of the tag transitions high so that the information is far from the carrier and not swamped by transmit leakage noise. The sharpness of the spectrum is dependent on the number of cycles at a given frequency, so the cleanest tag spectrum is produced when a single bit contains many tag cycles; but this means that it takes longer to transmit a bit for any given tag cycle time. Tag speed, receiver noise, and data rate must be traded off in the choice of the tag cycle time. We will see a clear example of this phenomenon in the Miller-Modulated Subcarrier scheme used in EPCglobal Class 1 Generation 2: higher Miller indices provide better interference rejection at the direct cost of lower tag data rates and thus slower inventories.  Packet Format and Command Sets: Most digital communications are based on packets of data: discrete chunks of a few tens to a few thousands of data bits, accompanied by standard headers and optional tails that provide information about the contents and purpose  365   Chapter 8  of the packet to the system. A simpliﬁed example is shown in Figure 8.2. Packet headers, often known as preambles, serve several important functions. The preamble usually contains some ﬁxed sequence of symbols that help the receiver to recognize the beginning of a packet and become synchronized with the clock of the transmitter; the latter is helpful to ensure that the instants at which the signal is sampled correspond to the appropriate moment within each transmitted symbol. Preambles also often contain some indication about the type of packet and the number of bits, so the receiver can know when to stop. The trailing bits appended to the end of the packet are often used to check for errors. Some or all the packet may be encoded using one of a large number of schemes that allow for very efﬁcient detection and correction of errors. Data or packets may be interleaved—transmitted out of time sequence—to guard against bursts of errors resulting from interference or fading. The data can be encrypted to provide security against interception by an unauthorized listener.  Figure 8.2: Schematic Depiction of a Data Packet.  The peculiar limitations of passive tags place constraints on packetization. Passive tags have limited logic and memory resources, so if packets are used, they should either be amenable to interpretation as each bit is received or be short so the memory required to store the received bitstream is small. Convolutional and block codes demand rather more resources than the tags have, so any error checking must be very simple. Encryption if used must also be very simple to implement.  Two very simple means of error checking, widely used in passive RFID, are parity checks and cyclic redundancy checks  CRC . A parity check is extremely simple: the bits in a chunk of data are added up, and one additional bit is sent whose value is determined by whether the sum was odd or even. A parity check requires only a single ﬂip-ﬂop to calculate and so is practical even for a power-limited RFID tag IC. However, parity checks are rather inefﬁcient and not very powerful. In order to avoid adding a lot of extra data, a parity bit should be appended only after several bits have been sent. The parity check will detect all single-bit errors in the dataset, but all multiple-bit errors in which an even number of bits are ﬂipped will not be detected.  366   UHF RFID Protocols  Cyclic redundancy checks are almost as easy to implement as parity checks and much more effective. A CRC is essentially computed by dividing the number represented by the data by a smaller known number and taking the remainder. Since bit errors change the value of the data  possibly by a large amount, depending on the bit that gets ﬂipped , they will also in general change the value of the remainder. The probability of randomly choosing a number with the same remainder becomes quite small when the divisor is large; for example, a 16-bit CRC provides a probability of roughly 1 in 65 000 of a correct result being produced by noise. Varying the number of bits in the error check allows the designer to trade off robustness of error detection for speed and simplicity: 5-bit, 8-bit, and 16-bit CRCs are common. CRC calculations can be carried out using shift registers  ﬂip-ﬂops connected in series  with some of the output values fed back and thus, can be implemented using only a handful of gates and very little power.  In conventional communications systems, packet formats are usually invariant with respect to the data carried by the packet to make sure that protocols are relatively independent of their application. However, in RFID, time and computational costs are so important that this practice is generally not followed. Instead, special packets and special symbols are used to convey commonly encountered commands, to minimize the amount of time the reader spends talking and maximize the number of tags that can be read with a given amount of time and energy.  Medium Access Control: Who gets to talk when? In most conventional communications systems, a separate discovery process allows nodes to become aware of what other nodes they might wish to converse with, and then messages can be routed in an efﬁcient fashion based on the existing table of possible contacts. Such a scheme is way too slow, power- hungry, and complex for a population of mobile passive tags. In most applications, the reader has no way to know how many tags are listening until it reads them. Instead, methods must be found to allocate the right to reply to tags in real time as they are counted. The selection of a single tag with which to communicate from a population of nominally identical tags is called singulation.  Two basic solutions to the singulation problem are the binary tree and Aloha protocols. A binary tree protocol exploits the fact that  hopefully  every tag is associated with a unique identifying number. If we picture all possible tag IDs as being leaves on a two-fold branching  inverted  tree, we can see that each ID is at the end of a unique path through the tree, and that at each step in the path, the number of possible IDs that could be at the end is reduced two-fold  Figure 8.3 .  We can construct a polling procedure that will access every possible tag ID, by exhaustively examining each possible node in the tree. That is, we start by asking for all tags whose ﬁrst  367   Chapter 8  Figure 8.3: Simple 4-bit Binary Tree Showing the Unique Path from the Root to the Leaf Corresponding to ID 0101.  digit is 0, thus, automatically addressing only half of all possible tags. If no tags respond, we need proceed no further on this half of the tree. Along each branch where a tag response is found, we bifurcate further, eventually achieving a condition where only one tag is responding so that its ID can be obtained without interference from other tags. Furthermore, the time taken should be roughly logarithmic in the number of nodes if the leaves are either sparsely populated or highly concentrated, since each time we ﬁnd a node with no tags on it, we are able to eliminate all the leaves attached to that node. When we have a large tree with only a few tags, we will ﬁnd empty nodes very high up in the tree and quickly eliminate most of it, concentrating only in those regions where tags are present. Only in the case where the leaves are densely populated and uniformly distributed over the number space will we need to survey a large part of the tree, but this will never happen for typical tag ID spaces: a 64-bit tag ID allows about 1.8× 1019 unique tag IDs, insanely larger than the number of tags that could be placed within the read zone of a single antenna.  It is also possible to intentionally deﬁne a uniformly populated but much smaller tree by associating a random number with a tag; this random number could be generated by the tag, or we could use  for example  the CRC calculated on the tag ID, which is a much shorter number with reasonably random properties. The advantage of such a procedure is that it avoids the common circumstance where a population of tags shares all but a few bits of their ID, and thus, responds in concert to most binary-tree queries, causing multiple collisions and making it difﬁcult for the reader to navigate the tree. A random singulation ID guarantees that the tree is sparsely and uniformly populated so that along most paths  368   UHF RFID Protocols  more than a couple of nodes deep only one or a few tags will be present. The cost is that the random numbers are not guaranteed to be unique, and the process will occasionally fail when two tags take the same random number.  Binary tree procedures are simple to implement and reasonably fast. One important disadvantage is that binary tree traversals work best when tags are uniformly present and responding to reader throughout. For example, it is most efﬁcient to traverse the tree by sending bits in sequence, without the laborious and slow elaboration of where the bit is in the tree. That is, it’s pretty easy to tell the tags: “START A TRAVERSAL: ok, 1 – 0 – 1 – 0 – 1 – 1 – 1 – 1”, atwhich point we are 8 nodes deep with 8 bits transmitted. However, a tag entering the process in the middle has not the slightest idea where we are and must therefore wait until the end before joining. Instead, we can send the whole path each time: “OK, TAGS, WE ARE AT THE NODE 10101111, and all tags whose next bit is a 0 can respond.” “OK, TAGS, NOW WE’RE AT 101011111 . . . ” This process allows a tag to respond to a query addressing a path it is on, even though it did not hear the ﬁrst few nodes. However, in either case, a late-arriving tag may be on a path that has been marked by the reader as being empty, and thus, may be ignored. These problems can be addressed by traversing the whole tree every time a tag is counted; the EPCglobal Class 0 protocol incorporates a very efﬁcient means of performing complete tree traversals for every tag ID, but the efﬁciency is achieved at the cost of a prior synchronization process that still prevents tags from joining an inventory in midstream. The Class 0 protocol, because it assumes bit-by-bit interactions between tag and reader, also limits tag speeds to no faster than reader speeds. This is a problem because tags usually have more information to transmit  their ID  than the reader, and reader spectra, being transmitted at much higher power levels, are of much greater concern to regulators than tag scattering.  Some of the limitations of binary tree MACs can be addressed by the clever use of randomness. Aloha protocols are based on early networking research conducted at the University of Hawaii  hence the name , and are based on the idea of random access to a channel. In basic Aloha, a station transmits a message whenever it has a message to send and waits for an acknowledgement. If no acknowledgment is received, it is presumed that the message was lost due to error or collision with another contending station. The station waits a random delay time and then retransmits the message. Aloha protocols are decentralized and thus scalable to large populations of stations and are very efﬁcient when the offered trafﬁc is a small percentage of the total trafﬁc that can be carried on a channel.  A very common variant of this procedure, slotted Aloha, restricts the start of a trans- mission to speciﬁc time slots; slotted Aloha is somewhat more efﬁcient when there is a lot of trafﬁc to send and it comes in well-deﬁned sizes, because once a station ‘captures’ a slot, there is no possibility of a collision between two stations until the beginning of the  369   Chapter 8  next slot. However, for slotted Aloha to work efﬁciently, the probability that a station attempts to transmit in a slot must be adjusted to keep the offered trafﬁc load moderate so that every slot is not lost to collisions. In the immensely popular Ethernet  IEEE 802.3  networking protocol, when a station does not receive an acknowledgement for a trans- mission, it waits for a random period—the backoff time—that increases exponentially each time the transmission is attempted and fails. In this fashion, stations adjust their behavior to the load on the network without any need for central coordination. In the case of an RFID reader expecting tags to remember how many times they have attempted to transmit their ID and calculate an appropriate backoff is rather ambitious. Instead, tags are usually equipped with a simple counter of some sort that is incremented or decremented by commands from the reader so that any complex trafﬁc management is performed by the reader rather than the computationally challenged tags. To be efﬁcient, the reader must do a good job of adjusting the likelihood of tag responses, for which purpose the reader needs to be able to distinguish between the three cases of no tag response, a single tag response, and a collision  multiple tags responding in a single slot .  The reader may ﬁnd it useful  or at least entertaining  to peruse the binary tree and slotted Aloha animations included on the CD accompanying the book.  8.2 Days of Yore  In the happy times at the dawn of UHF RFID, life was simple and problems were few.  Well, actually, the author lived through those times and can certify that there was no dearth of difﬁculties to surmount in every ﬁeld of human endeavor. What was in short supply was the fast, ultra-low-power CMOS circuitry we have now come to take for granted. Designers of passive RFID systems had to make do with minimal functionality and created simple protocols. Let’s look at a few.  We’ve already encountered some of the earliest work in the ﬁeld due to Koelle and coworkers at Sandia Laboratories  Figure 2.5, repeated below for convenience as Figure 8.4 , but we’re now in a much better position to appreciate what these early folks accomplished.  In this scheme, the reader transmitter did nothing but send a continuous-wave  CW  signal to power the tag. The tag used a diode to generate DC power from the RF signal. As soon as the DC power supply was sufﬁcient, the tag started backscattering an ID code. This is a tag talks ﬁrst scheme since the tag sends a message without waiting for the reader to instruct it.  This is a good thing since the reader doesn’t talk at all.  The tag used a subcarrier oscillator to ﬂip the state of the tag antenna 20 000 times per second—that is,  370   UHF RFID Protocols  Figure 8.4: Early Scheme for UHF Passive Tag, After Koelle et al., Proc. IEEE, 1975.  the subcarrier frequency was 20 kHz. The ID code in this case modulated the amount of subcarrier modulation of the tag load rather than the frequency: this is an amplitude-shift keyed, subcarrier-modulated uplink  Figure 8.5 . The tag is read-only  though these early tags did have a provision for modulating the subcarrier frequency based on the local temperature, thus supporting sensor integration . While not relevant to protocol issues, it is fun to note that Koelle’s group used an image-reject mixer in the receiver to make the result insensitive to the absolute phase of the backscattered signal.  Recall that the small tag signal must be combined with other reﬂections so that the amplitude and phase modulation of the resulting signal may not be simply correlated with the changes in radar cross section at the tag. Thus, amplitude modulation, even of a subcarrier, may not produce the desired signal at the reader. The problems of an amplitude-modulated return link were soon understood; subsequent developments quickly moved to frequency-shift-keyed tag modulation. During the 1980s, commercial standards were developed for identiﬁcation of  371   Chapter 8  Figure 8.5: Amplitude-shift-keyed, Subcarrier Modulated Symbol.

These standards are still tag- talks-ﬁrst in the sense that the tag begins transmitting its ID once it has powered up. The tag symbols are based on frequency-shift keying: symbols use both 20 kHz and 40 kHz modula- tion of the tag antenna load impedance. The actual symbols use a sort of Manchester coding  a term we will encounter again in connection with ISO 18000-6B below : the beginning of a binary ‘1’ symbol is modulated at 40 kHz but the frequency transitions in mid symbol to 20 kHz. A binary ‘0’ starts at 20 and transitions to 40 kHz. Like the Sandia tag, an AAR tag simply sends out all its data again and again once it is powered up.  372   UHF RFID Protocols  The tag contains 128 bits of data, rather more than in the Sandia work. Bits 126 and 127 violate the rules for Manchester symbols above and are used to mark the beginning of a dataset  frame —a trick we’ll also encounter again. The ID encodes certain features of the object being marked; for example, in the case of a railcar, the ID number contains the car length, the number of axles, and the side on which the tag is mounted.  By the early 90s, automobile toll tags were coming into wide use. Toll tags are usually semipassive, so avoiding unwanted activation is important. In addition, unlike a railroad  where only one car is in front of the reader at a time , a tolling station must deal with a number of tagged cars present simultaneously and so have some ability to deal with medium allocation. For example, California Title 21 is a reader talks ﬁrst protocol, in which the reader not only transmits a CW signal but can also send data, using Manchester-coded amplitude-shift keying at 300 kbps. The reverse link symbols are simple frequency-shift keying: a binary ‘0’ uses antenna modulation at 600 kHz and a binary ‘1’ is modulated at 1200 kHz; the data rate is also 300 kbps.  The high data rates are required to support toll reading on fast-moving automobiles in toll road applications.   The data consists of a header, some bits describing the tolling agency with which the tag is associated, and a unique 32-bit transponder ID. The data also includes a 16-bit cyclic redundancy check  CRC  to ensure that the tag’s ID has been correctly received.  To start a conversation, a reader sends 33 microseconds of continuous ‘1’ symbols, followed by a 100 microsecond power-off period  allowed because these are battery-powered tags . The reader then sends a polling message, containing a short preamble—a set of bits that is always the same to help the tag recognize the start of the message—followed by an agency code and a 16-bit CRC. The reader replies with its ID, after sending 100 microseconds of ‘0’ symbols to help the reader sync to it. When the reader has veriﬁed that the CRC checks, it sends an acknowledgement to the tag, containing the tag’s ID as well as the reader ID.  Since the acknowledgement contains the tag’s unique ID, it allows a speciﬁc tag to know it has been read. Once this ACK is received, the tag must refuse to reply to another polling message with the same agency code for 10 full seconds. This provides a simple sort of collision resolution: once a tag is read, it goes silent so that other tags can be heard.  These early protocols developed some key aspects of a passive tag protocol:  Long range using radiative coupling at UHF frequencies      Amplitude-shift-keyed reader symbols   Tag power harvesting from incident RF  373   Chapter 8       Frequency-shift-keyed tag symbols with antenna load modulation  Packet-based communications with coding violations and standard preambles to mark the start of a packet or frame    Cyclic redundancy check bits for error detection  but not correction     Persistent quiet states for simple collision mitigation  However, in addition to relatively high tag cost, they lacked some important capabilities for more sophisticated applications:    Medium access control adequate for dealing with a large number of tags in the    Multiple tag states and reader commands to allow segments of tag memory to  read zone  be read    Ability to modify the tag memory contents   Variable data rates to adapt to differing operating conditions  With the advent of RFID as a tracking technique for a wider variety of less-expensive assets, more sophisticated communications protocols were quickly proposed and demon- strated to support more varied requirements and take full advantage of rapidly advancing IC technology. Let us now examine these more recent approaches to specifying the interactions of tag and reader.  8.3 EPCglobal Generation 1  We brieﬂy reviewed the history of EPCglobal in Chapter 2. In the formative days of the AutoID Center, two new protocols were developed, denoted Class 0 and Class 1. These new protocols attempted to simultaneously provide improved forward and reverse link coding, medium access control, and tag state management, while being amenable to implementation in very simple, low-cost ICs. Neither of these protocols were completed or ratiﬁed by EPCglobal, but both saw widespread more-or-less compliant commercial implementation in the period 2002–2006. Though in many applications, Class 0 and Class 1 tags are being displaced by Class 1 Generation 2 tags, they remain of some practical and considerable theoretical interest as examples of approaches to solving the problems faced by a UHF passive tag protocol. Therefore, we shall brieﬂy examine both.  374   UHF RFID Protocols  8.3.1 EPCglobal Class 0  The Class 0 category was deﬁned as tags that are factory-written read-only, though in practice, ﬁeld-rewriteable tags are commercially available. Tags with both 64-bit and 96-bit Electronic Product Codes were envisioned and saw commercial implementation, although at the time of this writing, 64-bit tags are  happily  mostly preserved in retrospective collections and 96-bit tags are the norm. Matrics  since sold to Symbol Technologies and thence to Motorola  and Avery Dennison sold substantial commercial quantities of Class 0 tags; Matrics and Impinj produced chips implementing the protocol.  Reader symbols for Class 0 are shown in Figure 8.7. The symbols are pulse-length- encoded and amplitude-shift-keyed. The binary ‘0’ and binary ‘1’ symbols are chosen to provide continuous high average power to the tag; a random sequence of 1s and 0s would result in an average transmitted power of about 65% of the peak  CW  power of the reader. The special symbol ‘NULL’ is encountered rarely  it is used to launch tree traversals and induce certain state changes in the tag , and thus its impact on average transmitted power is minimal even though the average power during a NULL is quite low  about 1 4 of the CW power . The parameters shown are typical of United States operation, and provide a raw reader data rate of about 80 kbps.  Tag symbols are depicted in Figure 8.8. Here, the symbols are deﬁned by the frequency of transitions of the tag between different scattering states; the exact nature of the states is not critical as long as the radar cross section differs sufﬁciently in amplitude or phase to produce a backscattered signal. The symbols are conceptually similar to the 20 40 kHz frequency-shift-keyed tag symbols used in early UHF protocols, but the actual frequencies  Figure 8.7: Class 0 Reader Symbols, Depicted as Baseband Levels. Actual Transmitted Symbols Consist of a High RF  900-MHz  Amplitude  “RF ON”  with Low-amplitude or Zero-power Excursions  “RF OFF” .  375   Chapter 8  Figure 8.8: Class 0 Tag Symbols; Tag States “a” and “b” May be Any States Between Which the Radar Cross Section Differs in Amplitude or Phase.  used are higher and are not harmonically related. The tag backscattering is performed during the CW portion of the reader symbol. This is made possible by the choice of reader symbols and the protocol structure. Reader symbols are deﬁned by the duration of the low-power gap; as soon as power is restored, it is in principle possible for the tag to decode the symbol received. Furthermore, the protocol is structured as a bit-by-bit query-response rather than a packet transmission followed by an extended tag response. Therefore, the tag IC can be designed to decode the reader bit and decide on its response immediately after completion of the gap, allowing modulation to occur during the end of the reader symbols.  This interesting scheme has strengths and weaknesses. The system is in effect full-duplex: tag and reader transmit data effectively simultaneously, so the net data rate is twice the reader data rate. In order for such a scheme to work in the presence of the large baseband transients in the reader receiver that result from modulated transmit leakage, it is necessary to use a relatively high frequency for the tag transitions. In this case, the tag signal is displaced by 2–3 MHz from the carrier, so it is relatively easy to ﬁlter out the slow transmit leakage signals and recover the tag signal.  It is, however, worth noting that many dedicated Class 0 readers use a bistatic conﬁguration, as described in Chapter 4, to minimize transmit leakage. No amount of ﬁltering will help if any part of the receiver stage reaches saturation due to transmit leakage transients.  The use of a tag signal displaced from the reader carrier by such a substantial offset makes it relatively easy to design a sensitive receiver, and Class 0 tags typically display excellent and apparently forward-link-limited read range, despite the relatively early IC technologies used. The author’s experience suggests that ranges of 5 m could readily be obtained with a monostatic reader, and 8–10 m was achievable with a bistatic conﬁguration, using commercial tags.  Using such a large tag spectral displacement also carries signiﬁcant disadvantages. Under European regulatory recommendations, in which tag radiation is explicitly included, Class 0  376   UHF RFID Protocols  Figure 8.9: Simpliﬁed Class 0 MAC Scheme, Step 1.  tags could be expected to radiate unacceptable power levels outside of the allowed bands for RFID operation. Even in jurisdictions in which regulatory issues do not arise, but where a narrow band is available for RFID operation, the tag backscattered signals will be primarily or exclusively out of band. The tags are therefore exposed to interference from legal, possibly licensed, radiators whose operation may be beyond the inﬂuence or control of the RFID user. In United States operation, out-of-band and reader–reader interference are also substantial concerns since the tag signals will extend outside the ISM band when operating at near-edge channels and the binary symbols cross channels. For example, for a reader operating at 915 MHz, the tag signals are at 917.25 and 918.25 MHz; a reader transmitting on channel of either 916.75–917.25 or 917.75–918.25 MHz will block the tag signal unless the reader transmissions are very well conﬁned to the center of the channel, which is often not the case. Readers at 912 and 913 MHz will also downconvert to the tag frequencies at baseband. Thus, interference susceptibility can be as much as four times as high as a more conventional near-carrier tag signal.  Class 0 uses an interesting variant of the binary tree for medium access control. The scheme is depicted in a simpliﬁed form starting in Figure 8.9. The reader starts tree traversal with a special sequence. When tags hear this sequence, all tags backscatter the ﬁrst bit of their ID. If the reader hears only a 0 oronly a 1, it echoes that bit, by implication traveling down that branch of the tree. If it hears 0 and 1 symbols, it can choose to echo either bit at random. Each tag that hears the bit it just sent backscatters  377   Chapter 8  Figure 8.10: Simpliﬁed Class 0 MAC Scheme, Step 2.  Figure 8.11: Simpliﬁed Class 0 MAC Scheme, Step 3.  the next bit of its ID; if a tag hears the opposite bit from that which it sent, the tag goes mute until the next traversal. When the reader has echoed all the bits in a tag ID  four bits in this very simpliﬁed version , there should be only one tag left responding, and all the bits of its ID have been read. Thus, the tree is traversed one time for each tag that  378   UHF RFID Protocols  Figure 8.12: Simpliﬁed Class 0 MAC Scheme, Step 4.  Figure 8.13: Simpliﬁed Class 0 MAC Scheme, Step 5. Images for Steps 1–5 Used by Courtesy of RFID Revolution, LLC.  is present, and no empty branches are traversed. The tags need only interpret one bit at a time and require minimal memory; the reader’s job is also relatively simple as it need not keep any records of which nodes contained what tag replies but merely be guided by the tag response to each bit.  379   Chapter 8  This method of proceeding down the tree is relatively easy to implement and efﬁcient in terms of symbols transmitted. However, several problems arise from the procedure. Because the receiver must detect tag replies within a few microseconds of the end of a reader symbol, it is indispensable to use tag symbols well separated in frequency from the reader symbols  so that the reader transients can be readily ﬁltered , which as we noted causes out-of-band and interference challenges. The procedure as described results in the reader transmitting every bit of each tag’s ID. Since a reader transmits at a high power level, it is easy to intercept; if a clear line of sight is present, a listener with a directional antenna can capture the reader signal from several kilometers away. When the reader echoes all the tag bits, the tag IDs can therefore also be readily intercepted, which may reveal information a person or company would prefer to keep private.  A more subtle problem arises as a consequence of the interactions between tags that we mentioned in Section 7.4.2 of Chapter 7. When many tags with ID numbers that start with the same set of bits are placed in a dense array, they will all backscatter together  until we have proceeded far enough into the tree for the ID numbers to differ . Since the power received by a single tag is inﬂuenced by the presence of other tags, not only will some tags be shadowed, but the depth of the shadow will vary as the other tags modulate the state of their antennas. An example of this phenomenon is shown in Figure 8.14. In experiments conducted with Dan Kurtz of WJ Communications, the author observed tags mistaking the change in power due to such backscatter modulation for a NULL symbol from the reader, causing them to believe mistakenly that a new traversal had begun and reenter after having become mute. If such a tag ‘captures’ the traversal by being echoed by the reader, it will inevitably fail to be read since the tag and reader disagree about which ID bit is being transmitted. The reader will terminate the traversal when the ID and CRC bits have been received, not realizing that the bits received are actually from two partial IDs and will ﬁnd an invalid CRC and reject the read. When this happens frequently, reading efﬁciency is greatly impaired.  Finally, a procedure based on the tag’s unique ID can’t be used if the tag has not yet been programmed and carries only a default ID value  e.g. all 0s .  In order to mitigate some of these problems, the standard provides alternative bases for singulation. The reader can choose to singulate based on any of three ID numbers. ID0 is a random number generated at the time a traversal begins; ID1 is a 64-bit random number stored in the tag at the time of manufacture; ID2 is the tag’s unique ID  typically an electronic product code, EPC . If either ID0 or ID1 are used for singulation, most of the security and collective modulation problems are solved or greatly ameliorated.  The choice of which number to use is made with the rather obscurely named SetNegotiationPage command.  The disadvantages are that because the new IDs are random, there is some  380   UHF RFID Protocols  Figure 8.14: Received Power vs. Time for an Antenna Placed Near an Array of Class 0 Tags with Similar IDs, Being Used to Singulate. Note Relatively Slow 25-microsecond Symbol Times are Used Here. Image Used by Courtesy of WJ Communications.  chance that two tags will have the same random number. In this case, one or both will fail to be counted. In addition, the tag ID is not read until a tag is singulated.  In this case, the reader does not echo the tag ID bits but sends random data to cloak the tag information.  This means an additional step must take place after each tree traversal to complete the inventory, reducing the net count of tags per second.  In addition to the special symbol NULL, which is used to initiate tree traversals and also to induce certain state changes in the tags, there are explicit reader commands. Commands are of ﬁxed length  8 bits  with a single parity bit; in addition to SetNegotiationPage, there are commands to reset the ﬂags that indicate that a tag has been counted, force a tag to be dormant or mute, a Read command to read the tag ID, and a Kill command. Kill, when accompanied by the correct 24-bit password, is supposed to render the tag IC inoperable. The tag’s unique ID2, normally an EPC, is protected by a 16-bit CRC.  The tag state diagram is rather complex  Figure 8.15 . A tag is Dormant when it is powered up by a Reset  which is just 400–800 microseconds of CW from the reader . The  381   Chapter 8  Figure 8.15: Simpliﬁed Class 0 State Diagram.  high-frequency tag backscatter symbols require an accurate time base, so a special calibration sequence is used. After the Reset, the reader sends a set of symbols that enable the tag to calibrate its oscillator and a second set of calibration symbols that deﬁne the duration of binary 0,1, and NULL. Because this calibration is necessary for a tag to participate in an inventory, late-arriving tags must wait for the next calibration sequence to begin. This is potentially an important issue: during a normal traversal sequence, the reader simply continues to look for tags to read and stopping to reset all the tags  which takes a millisecond and will probably cause the tags to forget whether they have been counted  is rather wasteful. It is tempting to have the reader continuously count tags until there is reason to believe it is done, but during these long inventory sets, no tag can enter the process because it will not be calibrated.  A fairly typical path of a tag through the state diagram is depicted in Figure 8.16. After calibration, all calibrated tags will normally go into Global Command Start. Although  382   UHF RFID Protocols  Figure 8.16: Typical Path of a Tag Through the Class 0 State Diagram During an Inventory Operation.  several commands are possible, the one command typically issued is SetNegotiationPage, which tells the tags whether ID0, ID1, or ID2 will be used for singulation. The reader then issues a NULL to move all the tags back to Global Command Start. From there, the reader sends a binary ‘0’. Tags whose ﬂat is set—that is, tags that remember they have been counted, possible in a previous inventory operation—move back to Dormant, but the other tags enter the Tree Traversal state and proceed to send their ID bits. As long as a tag’s ID bits are echoed, it remains in Tree Traversal; if the reader sends a different bit, the tag moves to Tree Traversal Mute and waits for the next NULL to rejoin. Once all the ID bits have been sent, the reader issues another NULL, and the  presumably unique  tag that has been singulated can be addressed individually. The same NULL pulls tags that were not singulated  and therefore, transitioned to Tree Traversal Mute  back to Tree Start, from whence the same binary ‘0’ that causes the singulated tag to ﬂip its ID ﬂag starts the other tags into a new tree traversal.  383   Chapter 8  One of the interesting problems that arises in implementing the standard is to know when you’re done. How does the reader know when a tag is trying to reply? How does one distinguish between noise and signal? One possible approach is to continue until a certain number of total tag reads produce CRC errors, or alternatively until a certain number of consecutive reads are in error. When the error criterion is reached, the reader turns off transmit power and executes a frequency hop; once the new channel is stabilized, the process beings again. In this approach, complete binary-tree traversals may occur based only on noise, and one would expect that on occasion  roughly one of every 65 000 reads  a CRC would check against the data simply at random. That is, we would see a tag that is not present: a ghost tag. Ghost tags can be a problem in applications where readers can be expected to perform tens of thousands of reads per day and a real tag may only be read a few times, so it may not be realistic to require that a tag be read ﬁve or ten times consecutively in order to be considered real.  One could alternatively oversample the signal and perform a Fourier transform, to verify that backscatter power in the 2.2 and 3.3 MHz channels exceeds the noise, but this approach imposes more stringent computational requirements on the reader. The problem of deciding on a noise threshold remains, albeit the likelihood of a ghost tag read is reduced since traverses that contain no real responses can be terminated.  A related problem that was encountered when using ID2 for singulation is to determine the length of the tag ID. Older versions of EPCglobal’s tag data speciﬁcation assumed that the EPC’s header was coded to indicate the length of the EPC on the tag, but tags could be encoded in error or intentionally use a different header. A reader might attempt to read the EPC length encoded in the header, ﬁnd an erroneous CRC  which is inevitable if in fact the CRC is calculated on a different ID size  and fail to report the tag. It was possible to attempt reads at both common ID lengths  64 and 96 bit  and report whatever valid ID’s were obtained, but this is of course wasteful of inventory time. Happily, as we will see, the Generation 2 standard provides more speciﬁc requirements on the description of the ID length.  How long does it take for a Class 0 reader to inventory a population of tags? At the relatively short symbol times shown in Figure 8.7, about 1.4 milliseconds is required for the tag to send and reader to echo 96 bits of ID and 16 bits of CRC. This corresponds to a raw read rate of around 700 tags per second. However, read rates in the ﬁeld are often slower. Many commercial readers used a longer symbol time  25 microseconds  to get better signal-to-noise performance and narrower reader spectra; in this case, the peak achievable read rate is reduced to around 350 tags second. The fact that late-entering tags will be missed implies that it is necessary to restart the protocol  that is, to issue a RESET and calibration sequence  fairly frequently. A more substantial source of overhead is the  384   UHF RFID Protocols  need for many readers to communicate with a host over a serial or networked connection after one or a few read attempts are completed; this communication can take tens of milliseconds. The result is that actual peak read rates are generally in the range of 200 tags second for a moderate population of tags, and the number of times a given tag can be read in one second may be as low as 10 for real commercial readers. This low attempt rate has signiﬁcant impact on the ability of a reader to read fast-moving tags in a conveyorized environment. In Class 0 operation, it is a good practice to provide a sensor to ensure that a tag inventory attempt is always launched when a tagged object is properly positioned with respect to the reader antennas.  Because the Class 0 protocol document described Class 0 tags as being factory-written, no provisions for writing new data to the tags were speciﬁed. However, in practice, it is often the case that one needs to be able to write an EPC to a tag. Therefore, ﬁeld-writeable tags were produced, and since the commands and memory organization were not speciﬁed in the standards document, different vendors used different, mutually incompatible approaches. Happily, this oversight has been resolved in the second-generation Class 1 standard.  8.3.2 EPCglobal Class 1 Generation 1  Class 1 tags are passive tags able to backscatter a unique ID to a reader. The Class 1 category assumed that tags could be rewritten at least once, and in fact, all commercial implementations the author is aware of permit repeated programming of the tag ID. Tags with both 64-bit and 96-bit Electronic Product Codes saw commercial implementation, although again at the time of this writing 64-bit tags mostly remain in old tag collections. Alien Technologies and Rafsec, among others, sold substantial commercial quantities of Class 1 tags.  Tags are to support LOCK and KILL commands. The KILL command is protected by an 8-bit password, and a timeout period after a KILL attempt to try to thwart dictionary attacks on this very short key.  However, the timeout isn’t much protection, and Class 1 tags can hardly be considered secure against KILL attacks.  Unlike Class 0, the Class 1 protocol uses a fairly conventional packetized half-duplex protocol in which the reader sends a complete command packet, and then tags transmit a complete reply.  The Class 0 and Class 1 standards documents are resolutely incompatible, specifying different tag symbols, medium-access control, command sets, and state diagrams. The one exception is the reader symbology. The Class 1 reader symbols  Figure 8.17  are qualita- tively similar to the Class 0 symbols, both being pulse-duration-encoded amplitude- shift-keyed data. The alternate symbol set for Class 1 readers is nearly identical to that  385   Chapter 8  Figure 8.17: Class 1 Reader Symbols, Depicted as Baseband Levels. Actual Transmitted Symbols Consist of a High RF  900-MHz  Amplitude  “RF ON”  with Low-amplitude or Zero-power Excursions  “RF OFF” .  Figure 8.18: Class 1 Reader Transmission Sequence.  used for Class 0 binary data, although the special NULL symbol is not used in Class 1. The default or “base” set of reader symbols is qualitatively similar but uses shorter pulse durations and thus, provides slightly higher average power to the reader, at the cost of a slightly wider transmitted spectrum for the same data rate. The raw reader data rate at the default timing is about 70 kbps.  The sequence of communication for most commands is shown in Figure 8.18. A transac- tion gap longer than any other intentional interruption in RF signals the beginning of a command. The gap is followed by 64 microseconds of continuous RF transmission, after which the reader transmits the symbols corresponding to a command and corresponding parameters.  More information on the contents of these ﬁelds will be found below.  A terminating binary ‘1’ signals the end of the command frame  EOF ; after a sync interval  386   UHF RFID Protocols  Figure 8.19: Class 1 Tag Symbols; Tag States “a” and “b” May be Any States between Which the Radar Cross Section Differs in Amplitude or Phase.  during which the tags may reﬂect on the advisability of speaking up, another binary ‘1’ initiates the time period during which tags may respond to the command. Unlike Class 0, each reader command contains its own startup and synchronization, so tags have a new chance to enter an inventory at every transaction gap. On the other hand, the protocol is half-duplex, with readers talking for a millisecond or so followed by tag replies, so for the same reader data rates, it is somewhat slower than a Class 0 exchange.  The approach to tag modulation, sometimes known as F2F, is quite different from Class 0, in accord with the use of a packetized approach. The symbols are depicted in Figure 8.19. A state transition occurs at the edge of every symbol. When a binary ‘0’ is transmitted, a single additional state transition is present in the center of the symbol; when a binary ‘1’ is to be sent, three additional transitions  corresponding to a doubling of the frequency of the fundamental  are present. Although the approach is basically frequency-shift-keyed as in all backscatter coding, the frequencies used are much lower than those in Class 0. The tag data rate is about 140 kbps when the default T0 value is used. Higher tag data rates make sense, both because tags usually have a lot of data  the EPC  to send and because regulation of tag transmissions is generally less stringent than the corresponding rules for readers due to the much lower power levels used. The peak values of the tag spectrum will be around 140 and 280 kHz displaced from the carrier frequency for a 140 kbps return data rate; the latter frequency is at the edge of a 500-kHz United States ISM-band channel.  The Class 1 protocol’s approach to medium access control is much less speciﬁc than that of Class 0. Class 1 provides some specialized commands to facilitate a binary tree  387   Chapter 8  approach to collision resolution but does not specify any particular way to navigate the tree, and alternative commands for accessing the EPC of a tag are available. Thus, there are several rather different ways to use a Class 1 reader, appropriate depending on the number of tags one expects to encounter simultaneously in the read zone.  The simplest approach is to ignore the possibility of collisions. A reader can simply and repeatedly issue the command ScrollAllID, causing any tag that hears the command to backscatter its ID and CRC. The approach is sometimes known as Global Scroll mode. This scheme unsurprisingly works just ﬁne when only one tag is in the read zone, and it is relatively fast. When more than about three tags are present and their response is of comparable magnitude  i.e. when they are at similar distances from the reader antenna , collisions will nearly always occur, and this approach is very ineffective. However, a slight elaboration does remarkably well with small tag populations. The reader issues a ScrollAllID command until it obtains a readable reply with valid CRC; it then issues a Quiet command with the ID just received as the argument. The tag that successfully replied is placed in the Quiet state and no longer responds  at least until it loses power . This frees the medium up for the next- most-powerful or next-luckiest tag. Each time a tag is read, it is placed in the Quiet state so that the remaining population of unread tags shrinks and collisions become less likely. This approach works reasonably well for tag populations up to around 6–8 tags, particularly, if circumstances are such that the tags are likely to receive differing power levels so that the reader can proceed from strongest to weakest response. It is very simple to implement, but the reader needs to transmit the whole EPC of each tag that must be sent to Quiet and do so using the reduced data rate available to the reader, so this approach is around 3 times slower than Global Scroll.  Finally, the reader may use the PingID command, which is designed to aid binary tree navigation  Figure 8.21 . A PingID command provides a ﬁlter consisting of a starting location and a bit pattern; this ﬁlter is known as the mask. Tags whose EPC matches the mask bits at the relevant location respond to the PingID; nonmatching tags do nothing. After issuing the command, the reader uses isolated binary ‘1’ bits to deﬁne eight reply slots, known here as bins; the scheme is depicted in Figure 8.20.  A tag chooses a slot to reply in based on the three bits of its ID following the mask bits, so simply by observing which slot a reply occurs in, the reader may deduce the next three bits of the ID of the tag or tags replying.  The tag reply actually contains the next 8 bits of its ID, so in principle, the reader could read those bits if no collision occurred and jump ahead through the tree. However, since no error checking of the last 5 bits is provided, this is not entirely reliable, and some algorithms simply note the presence of a reply and step three bits deeper into the tree.  388   UHF RFID Protocols  Figure 8.20: The PingID Command is Followed by Bin Markers Deﬁning Eight Reply Slots. The Detailed Data Structure of the Ping Command is Explained Below.  Since there are essentially no restrictions on the contents of the mask in PingID, reader designers have considerable leeway on how they choose to navigate the binary tree. For example, if EPCs of interest are believed to all come from a given manager number and have the same model number  SKU , the mask can always start at this point, thus, very much reducing the scale of the binary tree to be searched at the cost of eliminating any tags in other parts of the tree from consideration. A reader may also choose to follow a tag’s bin replies all the way through the EPC, or short-circuit the process at some point and issue a ScrollID command, which causes a replying tag to backscatter its complete ID. If more than one tag was actually replying in a given bin  and therefore sharing the same mask bits , a collision may result and the CRC veriﬁcation will fail. Just as in Class 0, the reader faces the possibility that a number of tags with nearly identical EPCs may be present in the read zone; to ensure a uniformly populated tree segment, the reader can use the CRC bits, which should be randomly distributed, to perform singulation. An abbreviated sequence using the optional command PingScroll can be used to cause a tag to immediately reply in a bin with the remainder of its ID, and then continue on to the next bin without reissuing a command and mask, while the  presumably counted  tag transitions to the Quiet state. A reader can choose to issue a scroll command after each ping stage, on the assumption that the time wasted in a collision is modest if collisions are rare enough. The reader can declare the process done when a ﬁnal ping command on the lowest previously occupied level of the tree garners no replies.  Whatever approach to navigation is used, the procedure is likely to be unfriendly to tags arriving mid inventory: if they happen to lie in a portion of the tree that has already been searched, they will not match a ﬁlter value  except by chance  and will not reply until the next tree traversal is initiated.  389   Chapter 8  Figure 8.21: Simpliﬁed Example of Binary Tree Navigation Using the PingID Command.  The state diagram for Class 1 operation is a bit simpler than Class 0  Figure 8.22 . Tags power up and enter the Awake state unless they have a persistent timer telling them that they were recently counted, in which case they become Asleep. In cases where tags might have been left in the Asleep state in a prior inventory but it is desired to count all the tags present in the read zone, the reader should issue a Talk command before performing any other inventory actions, to ensure that all tags are awake. Tags do not automatically transition to Asleep after replying with their ID, except when they are replying to a PingScroll command and hear the appropriate Bin signal after their reply. The protocol calls out explicit programming commands EraseID and ProgramID and speciﬁes a memory organization for the tag EPC and CRC. Tags can be programmed directly from the Awake state without being singulated, which is useful for programming tags that have not received an ID and are thus awkward to singulate. The command VerifyID, which causes any unlocked tag that hears it to return its CRC, ID, and password, is also useful in dealing with tags that have not yet been programmed, or tags that may have been programmed in error. Some readers will also report the results of a VerifyID command without validating the CRC; this permits low-level debugging of tag responses that would otherwise be suppressed when CRC validation fails.  390   UHF RFID Protocols  Power Up  Awake  Reply  Asleep  Program  Dead  Figure 8.22: Simpliﬁed State Diagram for Class 1 Tag.  The general arrangement of the reader command bits is shown in Figure 8.23. All commands start with a preamble of 20 binary ‘0’ symbols to help the tag recognize and synchronize with the reader packet. All commands are 8 bits in length and protected by a single parity bit. Most commands use a mask and must therefore deﬁne the starting location and length of the mask as well as the data; each block is protected by a parity bit.  The measured baseband symbols encountered in a typical reader-tag exchange in global-scroll-like operation are shown in Figure 8.24. Each command is preceded by the preamble  spinup  of 20 binary ‘0’ symbols. The reader begins an inventory with a Talk command to ensure that tags are Awake and then issues ScrollAllID. The single tag responds with a preamble of 7 binary ‘1’ symbols and a binary ‘0’, followed by the CRC and EPC. The whole process, running at 70 kbps for the reader and 140 kbps for the tag, takes about 2 millisecond for a 64-bit ID. Some peculiarities that are of great importance in implementing the standard are:     The reader commands are sent least-signiﬁcant-bit ﬁrst, but the tag reply is transmitted most-signiﬁcant-bit ﬁrst; and  391   Chapter 8  Figure 8.23: Class 1 Reader Command Structure.     The 16 bits of ‘0’ data that are used to terminate the CRC calculation are actually sent over the air by the tag  ! .  The whole process, when implemented in this fashion with no collision avoidance, consumes around 3 millisecond per tag, thus allowing peak read rates of around 330 tags second. We can go faster by assuming that incoming tags have not been read for a long time and eliminating the Talk command, producing a peak rate of about 500 tags second, but as we noted, this procedure is questionable if more than a couple of tags are expected in the read zone. Implementing a full anticollision algorithm using the PingID approach is signiﬁcantly slower. If we actually traverse a whole  say 64-bit  tree at 3 bits per PingID command, it will take about 30 millisecond to read the tree leaves, though we may get lucky and singulate as many as 8 tags in the ﬁnal step. A more prudent approach is to singulate on the CRC, requiring only about 5–7 millisecond to singulate but  392   UHF RFID Protocols  Figure 8.24: Example of the Exchange between a Commercial Class 1 Tag and Commercial Reader.  with a risk of multiple tags in a given bin. Peak rates of 100–200 tags second are reasonable.  Class 1 readers can also be susceptible to ghost tag detection. However, because the tag reply is at a modest baseband frequency and is narrowband, it is more straightforward to oversample and impose a noise threshold requirement on the tag return signal. This allows the reader both to avoid ghost reads and to save time when a tag return signal is absent, or degrades partway into a read  which will happen when the forward link power is marginal; the IC runs out of stored power partway into backscattering its EPC .  8.4 ISO 18000-6B  Intellitag   Roughly contemporaneous with the EPCglobal ﬁrst-generation standards was the development of the ISO 18000-6A and -6B standards. The two parts of the standard, -6A and -6B, are unfortunately substantially distinct from one another, like EPCglobal Class 0 and Class 1: they use the same return-link symbols but are otherwise incompatible, with differing reader symbols, MAC approaches, and command sets. While these standards were somewhat focused on European regulatory requirements, a version of 18000-6B has also been implemented commercially in the United States by Intermec, under the trade name Intellitag. We shall brieﬂy review -6B here, as it appears to be the more widely used of the two versions.  393   Chapter 8  18000-6B is a packetized, reader-talks-ﬁrst standard. The reader symbols are Manchester- encoded ASK, with data rate of 10 or 40 kbps  Figure 8.25 . Manchester coding uses a state transition in the middle of a symbol time; the direction of the state transition  low-to-high or high-to-low  indicates the identity of the bit. In Manchester coding, the RF power is in the “low” state half of the time when the reader is modulating. The power delivered to the tag can be traded against the ability of the tag to see the reader symbols by varying the depth of modulation; the protocol allows either 15% modulation  lots of power, poor symbol deﬁnition  or 99% modulation  prominent symbols but 50% reduction in forward-link power .  Figure 8.25: ISO 18000-6B Reader Symbols.  The tag symbols are FM0, which is also used in 18000-6C  EPCglobal Class 1 Genera- tion 2 ; we introduced FM0 in Section 3.4 of Chapter 3 and will have more to say about shortly, as it is also used for the tag coding in EPCglobal’s second-generation standard. The tag datarate is 40 kbps, so each symbol lasts 25 microseconds. Tag transmissions are preceded by a preamble composed of 8 binary ‘0’ symbols, followed by the sequence 1v-0v-0-1-1v-0, where the subscripted v indicates a violation of the normal FM0 rules  Figure 8.26 . Violation symbols lack a state transition at the end of the symbol, as is normally required by FM0.  A reader packet  Figure 8.27  starts with 400 microseconds of CW power to ensure that tags are ready. The reader then sends one of two  currently  possible preambles, both containing symbol rule violations to help the tag uniquely identify the preamble. Reader packets are protected by a 16-bit cyclic redundancy check  CRC , as are tag replies.  394   UHF RFID Protocols  Figure 8.26: ISO 18000-6B Tag Packet Preamble. The Tag is Silent for At Least Two Symbol Times After a Reader Command. Violations are Symbols with No State Transition at a Symbol Edge.  Figure 8.27: ISO 18000-6B Reader Packet Structure. Violations are Symbols with No State Transition in the Middle. RFU = “reserved for future use”.  Tags are required to maintain eight 1-bit status ﬂags, though only four are currently deﬁned. Flag 1 is the Data Exchange Status Bit DE–SB and is set to 1 unless the tag has been powered off for more than 2 seconds, or has been initialized by the reader. Flag 2 indicates that a successful write operation has occurred. Flag 3 is set for a battery-assisted  395   Chapter 8  tag, in which case Flag 4 will be set if the tag has enough battery power for normal operation. Tag memory is organized into up to 256 blocks of 1 byte each; each block has a lock bit that can be set with a Lock command and whose status can be checked with a Query–Lock command.  Medium access control is managed using a variant of the slotted Aloha approach. Each tag has an 8-bit counter and a single-bit random number generator. At the beginning of an inventory, all tags set the value of COUNT to 0 and transmit their unique identifying number. If the reader is able to read a number, or sees no reply at all in the slot, it sends a Success message. When tags hear the Success command, they decrement their count by 1. If the reader detects a collision between tags, it sends a Fail message. If the reader sees a good-looking response with a CRC that doesn’t check, it may send an optional Resend command that causes the tag to backscatter its ID again. When tags hear a Fail message, if their COUNT is nonzero, they increment it by 1, If COUNT = 0 and the reader sends Fail, the tag generates a random bit and increments COUNT if the bit is 1; otherwise it tries sending again. The net effect is that when there are only a few tags present, COUNT will be 0 or close to 0 and the tags will send their UIDs. When many tags are present, frequent collisions will drive COUNT to larger values until good reads or empty slots start to occur, at which point tags will be able to again count down to a reply.  The tag states include Power-off, Ready, ID, and Data–exchange  Figure 8.28 . Tags are in the Power-off state until they power up  who would have thought? . Group selection commands are used to place the desired subset of tags to be inventoried in ID. Tags in the ID state are participating in an inventory, in essence trying to be identiﬁed by the reader. Tags that have scattered their ID can transition to Data–exchange upon receiving an appropriate command with their ID in it. A tag whose ID number is known a priori can be moved directly into the Data–exchange state.  The mandatory commands include eight variations of Group–Select. Each Select-type command includes a starting address, byte mask, and eight bytes of mask data. Starting at the starting address, each byte in memory is assigned one of the eight bits in the byte mask. Each byte is multiplied by the mask bit  so that if the mask bit for a given byte is 0, that byte is taken to be all-0 . The masked bits are then combined into a 256-bit binary number, which is compared to the number supplied in the mask data; various commands allow tags to be selected for an inventory if their masked memory is the same as the data, different from, larger than, or smaller than the data. The tag ﬂags can also be used for selection operations; they are treated as a single byte and masked bitwise by the byte mask.  Tags must implement the Success and Fail commands described above in connection with managing tag inventories. In addition, they must implement Initialize, which returns a tag  396   UHF RFID Protocols  Figure 8.28: Simpliﬁed Tag State Diagram for ISO 18000-6B-compliant Tag.  to the Ready state and resets Flag 1. The Read command is accompanied by a unique ID; a tag with that ID transitions to Data–exchange and backscatters 8 bytes of memory starting at the address cited in the command. Write allows the reader to write to a single byte of memory, unless that byte is locked; the tag replies with an error code if a write to a locked byte is attempted. A special command, Query–Lock, is provided to establish the lock states of bytes in memory.  How long does it take to read a tag? If we ignore any selection operations, consider only the actual counting operation, presuming that enough time has passed so that the tags’ COUNT values allow mostly collision-free processing, we can estimate inventory speed. At 40 kbps, it takes about 1 millisecond for the reader to transmit a Succeed or Fail command. The tag replies with 8 bytes of data  a 64-bit ID  and 16 bits of CRC in about 2.6 milliseconds. The whole process, thus, ideally takes about 3.6 milliseconds, allowing roughly 275 tags second to be counted. Actual performance will not be this fast: in general, we must expect some fraction of empty slots and collided slots in a large tag population due to the stochastic nature of the MAC algorithm. Empty slots take only a bit  397   Chapter 8  more than the 1 millisecond needed for the tag command. Collided slots may consume the whole of a tag response time since fast and reliable identiﬁcation of a collision is difﬁcult: the reader may need to listen to the whole response and check the CRC, only to ﬁnd that errors caused by a collision have prevented a valid ID from being received.  The 18000-6B protocol has several nice features. Memory structure and access are speciﬁed in the protocol. The MAC approach permits late-arriving tags to participate in an inventory. Memory can be locked against writing. A ﬂexible scheme is provided for selecting subsets of tags to inventory based on the contents of their memory. Forward-link power can be traded for forward-link signal-to-noise.  However, the protocol also has some serious limitations. It is rather slow, with an ideal peak rate of around 300 tags second and realistic rates rather lower. The design of the MAC allows fast response for small populations of tags, but when a large number of tags is present, there will be a setup time while COUNT values are shifted away from 0 to allow enough spacing for distinct replies. The tag reply spectrum is close to the reader carrier signal  roughly 40 kHz away , making it challenging to ﬁlter out phase and amplitude noise from reader transmit leakage. Multiple collocated readers will interfere with one another unless they happen to enforce stringent transmit spectral masks  which is not required by the protocol document . Singulated commands require the reader to send the unique ID of a tag and have no encryption, so an eavesdropper can readily intercept tag IDs and other detailed information. Lock commands are not protected by a password; instead, it is assumed that the memory will be locked prior to placing the tag in service. Finally, there is no provision for killing a tag.  8.5 ISO 18000-6C  EPCglobal Class 1 Generation 2   ISO 18000-6B, Class 0 and Class 1 tags, and readers saw substantial commercial deployment and helped enable the early stages of RFID implementation for many supply-chain vendors and retailers. These ﬁrst-generation tags and readers validated the idea that simple, inexpensive ICs and low-cost tag antennas could provide acceptable UHF performance. However, the initial protocols suffered from signiﬁcant limitations some of which we have alluded to in discussion:    Both EPCglobal protocols use variants of binary-tree-based collision resolution and  are thus, unfriendly to late-arriving tags.    None provides any link-level security during programming operations.   All have difﬁculties maintaining unique sessions with tags that lack compliant  EPCs or UIDs  like tags that have not yet been programmed .  398   UHF RFID Protocols          The relationship between tag and reader data rates is inﬂexible.  There is no control of the reader transmit spectrum and no ﬂexibility to adapt the reader and tag spectra to minimize interference.  The EPCglobal protocols are susceptible to phantom  ghost  tag reads.  By the end of 2003, these limitations were sufﬁciently apparent that resources in EPCglobal were reallocated from working groups supporting the ﬁrst-generation protocols to a second-generation standard that could address them.  The Generation 2 standard  hereafter abbreviated Gen 2  is different in most respects from the ﬁrst-generation standards. Several of the most important enhancements are:  Flexible tag data rates  Spectral control of reader and tag transmissions to minimize interference          Use of Aloha-based adaptive collision resolution with a readily variable number  Separate protocol control bits with explicit declaration of the EPC length    Random-number-based logical sessions allowing singulation in the presence of    Multiple persistent ﬂags supporting quasi-simultaneous inventories from different  space  the Q-protocol   identical or absent EPCs  readers    Variable-length commands for inventory speed improvement    Explicit speciﬁcation of memory maps, lock and permalock provisions, and programming procedures  Link cover coding for secure tag programming      A compliance and interoperability testing procedure deﬁned by EPCglobal  Early experience suggests that Gen 2 is robust and ﬂexible, generally producing improved read performance both in single-user and dense-reader operation. Many applications that used ﬁrst-generation protocols have gracefully transitioned to Gen 2 tags and readers with improved results. Let us take a close look at how the protocol achieves this superior performance.  399   Chapter 8  8.5.1 Overview and Tag Memory Organization  Gen 2 explicitly calls for a ﬁeld-writeable tag with the implication that multiple write cycles are possible. Individual ﬁelds can be locked against writing and in some cases read- ing, and the tag can be killed. Lock and Kill operations are protected by 32-bit pass- words. Protocol Control bits describe among other things the exact length of the EPC, so any length EPC may be used. Essentially, all the leading vendors participated in deﬁning the standard, and most leading vendors of tags and readers have produced compliant products.  The Gen 2 standard  happily  speciﬁes the organization of a compliant tag’s memory  Figure 8.29 . There are two obligatory and two optional memory banks, numbered in binary  that is, bank ‘10’ is decimal ‘bank two’ . Bank 00 contains  at least  the 32-bit KILL and ACCESS passwords. Bank 01 contains, in addition to the tag’s EPC, a 32-bit Protocol Control  PC  word, describing the length of the EPC, as well as some optional information about the tag, and the CRC16 used for error checking of the EPC value. Note that in a Gen 2 tag, the CRC is calculated by the tag and need not be written to memory by the reader. The optional Tag ID bank 10 provides for identifying information related to the tag, distinct from any object to which it might be attached. Such a capability is useful for tracking tag IC manufacturing and tracking tag inventory. Finally, optional User bank 11, whose organization is not constrained except for the numbering of bytes and words, is available for any application-speciﬁc data.  Figure 8.29: Gen 2 Tag Memory Organization and Terminology.  400   UHF RFID Protocols  Locations in memory are speciﬁed by extensible bit vectors  EBV , which allow memory banks to be of arbitrary size; the banks are not limited to the 8 words depicted in Figure 8.29. In the EBV scheme, the ﬁrst byte of an address is divided into an extension bit and seven data bits. If the extension bit is 0, the data bits contain the complete address. If the extension bit is 1, at least one more byte is to be appended to the address data. Since that byte also has an extension bit, the address can be arbitrarily long. This ﬂexi- bility is achieved at the cost of the loss of 1 8 of the capacity of the address bits since one bit of every byte is devoted to extension control even when no extension is required. Two examples of EBV addresses are depicted in Figure 8.30. In the top example, the extension bit is 0, and the value is simply that of the remaining bits, decimal 5. In the bottom example, the ﬁrst byte’s extension bit is 1, so the remaining bits of the byte are multiplied by 27 = 128, and the next byte is examined. Since its extension bit is 0, the data in the remaining bits ﬁnishes the EBV, and the value is 128× 5 + 3 = 643.  The status of a particular tag in inventory operations is managed by ﬁve one-bit ﬂags: four session ﬂags S0 through S3 and a Select ﬂag SL. The state of these ﬂags can be set by the versatile Select command. They are used to constrain the subset of tags to which inventory operations apply, and to maintain the status of a tag with respect to up to four quasi-simultaneous inventory operations. We shall have more to say about this system as we proceed.  Figure 8.30: Examples of an EBV Address.  401   Chapter 8  8.5.2 Reader and Tag Symbols and Coding  Gen 2 is a packetized, reader-talks-ﬁrst protocol. The reader symbols are the amplitude- modulated, pulse-interval-encoded  PIE  symbols we introduced in Chapter 3. A binary ‘0’ consists of a power-on interval followed by a power-off interval of equal duration. The total length of a binary ‘0’ deﬁnes the time interval Tari; the pulsewidth PW is half of Tari. A binary ‘1’ uses the same pulsewidth at the end of a longer power-on interval; the duration of a ‘1’ can be as short as 1.5 Tari or as long as 2 Tari. Standard values of Tari are 6.25, 12.5, and 25 microseconds, corresponding to symbol rates of 160, 80, and 40 kbps.  Figure 8.31: Gen 2 Reader Symbols.  402   UHF RFID Protocols  The Gen 2 standard deﬁnes three different operating categories for readers, with corres- ponding limitations on the transmitted spectral width. The ﬁrst, single-interrogator operation, imposes no requirements on the reader transmission beyond those asserted by the relevant regulatory authority. Multiple-interrogator operation, designed for those cases where the number of simultaneous collocated readers is modest compared to the number of available channels, places some constraints on the transmitted spectrum sufﬁcient to minimize interference in adjacent or second-adjacent channels. Dense-interrogator requirements are designed to allow successful tag reading even when every available channel is occupied by a reader transmitter.  The limitations on bandwidth are expressed in terms of spectral masks, which show the maximum power a reader can transmit in each frequency range relative to the carrier frequency fc. Spectral masks for multiple- and dense-interrogator operation are shown in Figure 8.32.  In both masks, the limitation is placed on the integrated  total  power in a speciﬁed frequency range, relative to the total power in the center  intended  channel. The limits are expressed in dB relative to the power in the center channel, dBch. Frequency offsets for the multiple interrogator mask are expressed in terms of channels relative to the intended channel; in United States operation, these channels would generally be 500 kHz wide. Because the channel width is ﬁxed for a given regulatory region, multiple-interrogator requirements can in principle be met by simply reducing reader data rates, presuming reasonable symbol ﬁltering. In contrast, dense interrogator frequencies are speciﬁed in terms of the inverse of Tari, the duration of a binary 0, so the width of the mask scales with data rate and conformance can not be achieved by changes in rate.  The spectral mask is depicted in more familiar terms as a function of frequency offset in Hz in Figure 8.33, for the speciﬁc case of Tari = 25 μs. In this view, it is easy to see that the main power in the signal is constrained to lie within a 100-kHz-wide region centered on the carrier frequency.  Dense reader operation is particularly important under European or Asian regulations, where relatively little spectrum is available. For example, under ETSI 302 208  where Tari = 25 microseconds is most likely to be used , the 865- to 868-MHz band is divided into 200-kHz-wide channels. If readers are operating in every channel, the emission masks will abut each other, and the power of a compliant interfering reader within the neighboring channel will only be down by about 30 dB. This is insufﬁcient for interference-free operation, as a tag signal is typically 50–60 dB below the reader signal. However, if readers are limited to alternate channels, the tag signal can be centered 200 kHz from either reader signal, with a 100-kHz wide region in which the reader power is reduced by 60 dB  403   Chapter 8  Figure 8.32: Spectral Masks for Multiple- and Dense-interrogator Operation. See Text for Explanation of Terminology.   Figure 8.34 . This is sufﬁcient to allow reasonable tag reception even in the presence of modulated reader signals. We shall see shortly how Gen 2 arranges for the tag spectra to be appropriately offset from the carrier.  The bandwidth of the transmitted spectrum for amplitude-modulated PIE symbols is set by the width of the feature PW, which is ﬁxed. We looked at simpliﬁed ideal spectra for PIE  404   UHF RFID Protocols  Figure 8.33: Spectral Mask for Multiple-interrogator Operation Using Tari = 25 microseconds, Depicted vs. Offset from the Carrier in kHz.  Figure 8.34: Spectral Masks for Dense Reader Operation in Alternating 200 kHz Channels.  symbol streams in Chapter 3; an ideal spectrum has a sharp feature at the frequency offset corresponding to a binary ‘0’ symbol  f = 1 Tari  and substantial power out to about twice that frequency. The extent of the spectrum outside these fundamental limits is highly sensitive to the extent to which the edges of the pulse are smoothed. A very smooth  405   Chapter 8  transition from high to low RF power provides a narrow spectrum, but the link budget is somewhat reduced because the transmitted power only attains a zero value brieﬂy at the bottom of the smoothed pulse; if the sampling time is slightly offset from this point, the depth of modulation is reduced.  Examples of measured RF power vs. time for smoothed  ﬁltered  and unsmoothed  unﬁltered  Gen 2 symbols are depicted in Figure 8.35. The unﬁltered single-interrogator symbols  top  show very sharp edges; power drops by 40 dB in a period of about 3 microseconds. The tag can sample anywhere within the pulse and will detect a very low power level. In contrast, the ﬁltered multiple-interrogator symbols  bottom , which uses a ﬁnite-impulse-response  FIR  ﬁlter to ensure very smooth changes in power levels, have very gradual transitions between high and low RF power. The lowest power level reached,  Figure 8.35: Measured Transmit Power vs. Time for Reader Using Unﬁltered Symbols  Single Interrogator Mode  and Filtered Symbols  Multiple Interrogator Mode ; Tari = 25 microseconds.  406   UHF RFID Protocols  at about 20 dB below the peak power, is still quite sufﬁciently suppressed to provide a good signal to a tag, but the smoothed transition means that if the sampling time is displaced by  say  half the pulsewidth, the apparent depth of the pulse is reduced from 20 to 10 dB; the corresponding voltage signal is 1 3 of the peak voltage rather than 1 100 as is the case for the unﬁltered symbol, and is obviously more susceptible to misinterpretation due to noise and offsets. Filtering reduces spectral width but also affects link budgets, particularly for passive tags with imprecise clocks and limited signal processing.  The measured spectra for unﬁltered  unsmoothed  PIE symbols—‘single interrogator’ operation—and optimally ﬁltered symbols for multiple interrogator operation are depicted in Figure 8.36. It is quite obvious that the price of the extra link budget of unﬁltered symbols is a very wide spectrum, with substantial power as much as 1 MHz from the carrier even for very modest 40 kbps data rates. Single-interrogator readers may interfere across multiple channels and are inappropriate for use in critical dense-reader areas except  Figure 8.36: Measured Transmitted Signal Spectrum for a Commercial Reader in Single Interrogator  unsmoothed  Operation and Multiple Interrogator  smoothed  Operation, Both Using Tari = 25 microseconds.  407   Chapter 8  at very low duty cycle. The multiple-interrogator operating mode has a much narrower spectrum with essentially no radiated power farther than about 100 kHz from the carrier. However, by reference to Figure 8.33, we can see that this is not good enough for dense interrogator compliance: the power in the signal must be 30 dB below the carrier level for displacements of only 50 kHz from the carrier, a very stringent requirement that will at best be marginally achieved by even the multiple interrogator signal.  Smoothing a symbol by itself can thus provide limited beneﬁts in spectral width. The Gen 2 standard provides two alternative methods for reducing the width of the transmitted spectrum. Both approaches allow the reader to use bandwidth more efﬁciently than amplitude modulation alone, while behaving from the tag’s point of view as a conventional amplitude-modulated signal. We examined these modulation approaches in some detail in Section 4.4.1 of Chapter 4; the reader may wish to brieﬂy revisit that section to recall these matters to mind. The ﬁrst, phase-reversal amplitude-shift keying  PR-ASK , is a variant of binary phase-shift keying and is very similar to duobinary data transmission. The second, single-sideband  with carrier injection , removes one of the sidebands that would normally be present in an amplitude-modulated signal. Both these techniques achieve roughly a factor of two improvement in bandwidth for a given data rate.  SSB modulation in this context requires that the carrier frequency be offset from the nominal channel center during reader modulation and then returned to the center frequency during CW transmission. While this sort of operation is possible with modern digitally synthesized transmitters, it is relatively complex. PR-ASK is simpler to implement, produces a sym- metrical spectrum, and does not require any special offsets. However, there are a few subtleties to be aware of in using it. Since the pulse feature  PW of Figure 8.31  is the result of the transition of the transmitted signal between positive and negative phases, the time for the transition must be carefully managed in order to produce the correct pulse width. As we shall see shortly, the beginning of every reader transmission also contains a special delimiter symbol that is always the same duration, irrespective of the data rate; this may require special provisions in PR-ASK. Finally, any offset correction that is used in the receiver must account for the fact that even if the signal returns to full CW power before a tag response is to be detected, it may be at the opposite phase from that at which the reader transmission began.  A closeup view of measured spectra for single, multiple, and dense interrogator operation using the same Tari of 25 microseconds is depicted in Figure 8.37. It is clear at this scale that the single and multiple interrogator spectra are substantially identical in the core region within roughly 40 kHz  = data rate  of the carrier. Filtering only affects the spectra outside this region: a 40 kHz sine wave is necessary to form the binary-‘0’ symbol of duration Tari, even when optimally smoothed. It is difﬁcult to ﬁt this spectrum into a mask  408   UHF RFID Protocols  Figure 8.37: Measured Transmit Spectra for a Commercial Reader in Single-Interrogator, Multiple-Interrogator, and Dense-Interrogator Modes, All With Tari = 25 microseconds.  extending only 50 kHz from the carrier.  The reader may ﬁnd it interesting to compare these measured spectra with the calculated spectra in, for example, Figures 3.11 and 3.12. The differences are due to the ﬁnite resolution of a real spectrum analyzer and averaging over a longer stream of symbols for the measured data.   The dense-interrogator spectrum  implemented in PR-ASK  is obviously quite distinct from the other two. The prominent peaks corresponding to the binary-‘0’ feature are displaced by slightly more than 10 kHz instead of 40 kHz. At 50 kHz from the carrier, the spectral power is reduced by about 50 dB from the peak power, so this spectrum is amenable to robust compliance with the spectral mask. The power at the carrier frequency is considerably reduced relative to the modulation peaks, as is always the case using phase modulations; since the carrier contains no information, this is a desirable result.  Gen 2 tag symbols and uplink signaling are remarkably ﬂexible and inevitably quite complex. The default operating mode, known as FM0, is reasonably straightforward. The  409   Chapter 8  Figure 8.38: Default G2 Tag Signaling  FM0 .  tag changes its backscatter state at the edge of every symbol. A binary ‘0’ has an additio- nal state transition in the middle of the symbol; a binary ‘1’ doesn’t. All transmissions end with a ‘dummy’ binary ‘1’ symbol and always end on the same  ‘low’  state; if the ﬁnal ‘1’ bit ends in this state, there is no transition after the ﬁnal dummy bit  and it could be said not to exist! .  The symbol time, denoted Tpri, is the same for 1-bits and 0-bits, so the data rate is the inverse of the symbol time. The symbol frequency, equal to the data rate for FM0, is known as the backscatter link frequency  BLF . It is clear that a string of binary ‘0’ bits looks like a clipped sine wave with a frequency of BLF, and a string of ‘1’ bits looks like a clipped sine with a frequency of BLF 2, so we’d expect FM0 spectra to have peaks displaced about BLF and BLF 2 from the carrier.  FM0 signaling is simple to implement and returns 1 bit per symbol time but depends on the accurate detection of a single transition to distinguish between data bits. The spectrum of the tag signal is also not ideal for avoiding interference from cochannel readers. For example, referring to Figure 8.34, in order to avoid interference from dense-interrogator readers, we could set the BLF to about 200 kHz, putting the spectrum from binary ‘0’ symbols in the region where the reader power is miminized. However, the spectrum of a stream of binary ‘1’ symbols would then be located about 100 kHz from the carrier, in the region where modulated reader power is only down by 30 dB, and quite susceptible to cochannel interference.  Remember, what we’re worried about is a different reader operating on the same channel; the reader that is trying to read the tag is transmitting CW power when the tag is backscattering, and thus, emits a very narrow spectrum, as long as phase and amplitude noise are small.   In order to provide more ﬂexibility for noise vs. data rate tradeoffs and spectral manage- ment, the Gen 2 standard deﬁnes a second, closely related approach to tag signaling: Miller-modulated subcarrier  MMS  encoding. In MMS, the data bits are ﬁrst encoded in  just for fun  the opposite fashion of FM0: that is, a binary ‘1’ is given a state transition in  410   UHF RFID Protocols  the middle of a symbol time and a binary ‘0’ is not. Let’s call this the baseband encoding. Not only are the symbol deﬁnitions different from FM0, but instead of there being a state transition at every symbol edge as in FM0, in the baseband coding of MMS, there is no state transition at the symbol edges between consecutive 1s, or between a 1 and a 0. However, there is a state transition at a symbol edge between two consecutive 0 s.  The baseband coding is then multiplied  or added modulo 2, as you prefer  by a square wave containing M cycles in every baseband symbol, where M can be 2, 4, or 8. The result is a square-wave-like signal with periodic phase inversions; if this signal were the RF transmission, we would say that it is binary-phase-shift-keyed. A simple example with M = 2 is shown in Figure 8.39.  Figure 8.39: Miller-modulated Subcarrier Example, with M = 2.  It is important to note that MMS does not change Tpri or the backscatter link frequency. MMS encoding with M = 2 means that two cycles of the subcarrier are needed for every bit: the data rate is half of what it is using FM0 at the same link frequency, and, of course, in general the data rate is BLF M. An example showing how the same data is coded at differing Miller indices is depicted in Figure 8.40. Note that, like FM0, MMS reader transmissions also have a binary ‘1’ symbol appended at the end of the data.  With increasing values of M, Tpri, the state cycle time for the tag, is ﬁxed, but the number of cycles composing a single-bit symbol is equal to M, so the rate of transmission of data is reduced. At the same time, the spectrum becomes more narrowly centered around the major peaks, which are displaced by the link frequency from the carrier. An example of this effect is shown in Figure 8.41 for a string of about 160 random symbols for FM0, or 40 MMS symbols.  411   Chapter 8  Figure 8.40: Example of Encoding the Same Datastream Using MMS with Miller Indices  M = 2,4, and 8 .  Figure 8.41: Comparison of Tag Response Spectra for Random Finite String of Symbols; BLF = 125 kHz for both.  Thus, by using MMS with  for example  M = 4 and BLF = 200 kHz, we can put almost all the tag backscattered power in a narrow region 200 kHz above and below the carrier; for example, referring to Figure 8.34, all the tag power would fall in the center of channel 2 if the tag is excited by a reader transmitting in channel 1. If all the readers are dense- interrogator-compliant and placed in alternate 200 kHz channels  as in Figure 8.34 , the tag power will lie in a region in which very little reader power is present, even when there are collocated readers on the same channel as the reader whose CW signal is being backscattered. That is, even when a modulating reader is present on channel 1 and another  412   UHF RFID Protocols  on channel 3, and both are transmitting commands to their tags while the nearby reader on channel 1 is transmitting CW, it will still be possible to receive the tag signal with minimal interference.  An additional beneﬁt is that, since the tag spectrum power is mostly contained in a narrower region, the receiver can use more selective ﬁltering, reducing the amount of noise entering and thus, improving the signal-to-noise ratio for reverse-link-limited conditions. A receiver would need a passband extending from about 20 kHz offset to 200 kHz offset from the carrier to receive the FM0 signal of Figure 8.41, whereas a bandwidth of about 120 to 140 kHz is needed to capture essentially all the FM0 signal—that is, the SNR improvement scales with the Miller index, 8 in this case.  In addition to the choice of whether to use FM0 or the three variants of MMS, the backscatter link frequency BLF can vary from 40 to 640 kHz. The data rate is the ratio BLF M, so the tag data rate can range from 5 kbps to 640 kbps. The same data rate can be obtained with differing spectra and link characteristics by specifying differing Miller indices and link frequencies. This ﬂexibility provides the user with the ability to adapt to differing conditions, but it also makes both the design of the tag ICs and the software to manage communications complex relative to earlier standards.  8.5.3 Packet Structure  Gen 2 is a packetized, reader-talks-ﬁrst protocol, like Class 1 Generation 1. The reader chooses the forward-link and reverse-link parameters and communicates these choices to the tags using the opening symbols of each packet, which are known as a preamble when the reader is initiating an inventory operation, or a frame sync when any other command is sent. Preambles set tag  uplink  parameters for the remainder of an inventory session. Frame syncs contain only the reader timing information, to help tags stay synchronized during successive operations. The baseband representation of these sequences is shown in Figure 8.42. Each sequence begins with a delimiter. As we alluded to previously, the delimiter is always 12.5 microseconds long, regardless of the data rate used by the reader or tag. This makes the delimiter relatively easy for a tag to detect but can be awkward when PR-ASK is used: since pulses are the result of the path of the transmitted signal in phase space passing through 0 during transitions between +1 and −1 constellation points, the rate of the transition between the two states must be changed to send the delimiter except when Tari = 25 microseconds.  After the delimiter, the reader sends a binary ‘0’ deﬁning the value of Tari, followed by the special reader-to-tag calibration symbol RTcal. As shown in the inset to the ﬁgure, the total duration of RTcal is equal to the sum of the duration of a binary ‘0’ and a binary ‘1’  413   Chapter 8  Figure 8.42: Preamble and Frame Sync Sequences. Inset Shows that RTcal = Sum of Duration of Binary ‘1’ and Binary ‘0’ Symbols.  symbol. RTcal is allowed to be from 2.5 to 3 times as long as Tari, implying that a binary ‘1’ symbol can be from 1.5 to 2 times as long as Tari.  A longer symbol results in a lower reader data rate but is easier for the tag to distinguish from a ‘0’.   The preamble, used only at the start of an inventory operation, contains the additional tag-to-reader calibration symbol TRcal. TRcal itself is not useful until the reader also sends the parameter divide ratio  DR , which accompanies the command containing the TRcal symbol. The tags that hear the command can then determine their link frequency:  BLF = DR TRcal  .   8.1   The divide ratio can take the values 8 or 64 3 ≈ 21. Some example values for these parameters are given in Table 8.1. The tag data rate is BLF M. So, for example, the following parameter sets all produce a tag data rate of 320 kbps:  TRcal = 67 μs, DR = 64 3, and M = 1 TRcal = 33 μs, DR = 64 3, and M = 2 TRcal = 25 μs, DR = 8, and M = 1  414   Table 8.1: Example Values for Tag-reader Calibration Symbol Duration TRcal, Link Frequency BLF, and Tag Cycle Time Tpri.  TRcal  μs   BLF  kHz   Tpri  μs   UHF RFID Protocols  Divide Ratio  64 3  8  33 67 83 225  17 25 50 200  640 320 256 95  465 320 160 40  1.6 3.1 3.9 10.5  2.1 3.1 6.3  25  Because the spectrum is mainly determined by BLF and to a lesser extent M, this scheme allows the user to adapt the location and width of the backscatter spectrum somewhat independently of the data rate. However, recall from Chapter 4 that the reader receiver ﬁlters the received signal to remove as much noise as possible; ideally, the receive ﬁlter is well matched to the bandwidth of the signal to be detected. So it doesn’t make any sense to allow the user of a reader to change the tag data rate unless the reader’s receiver is also designed to make the appropriate changes in the receiver ﬁlter’s passband. While it is possible to make adjustable baseband ﬁlters using modern active ﬁlter circuitry, it is cheaper to use conventional passive components  capacitors, resistors, and possibly inductors  to form the ﬁlter. Inexpensive readers may be designed to operate only in a narrow range of tag data rates; changing the requested rate in the software may produce poor results due to receiver ﬁlter mismatch with the tag signal. A user shouldn’t be able to change these settings unless the reader designer has ensured that corresponding ﬁlter changes will take place!  Tag replies, in turn, are preceded by a preamble and optional pilot tone  Figure 8.43 . The preamble is a sequence of binary symbols 1-0-1-0 with a violation: a symbol that does not obey the normal rules for FM0 symbol formation and is used only in the preamble. The violation helps to uniquely identify a preamble and distinguish it from any other tag data stream. However, the violation symbol, which persists at one value for longer than any normal data symbol, has a slightly different spectrum with more energy at low frequencies. Baseband ﬁltering in the reader receiver must be speciﬁed with the violation symbol in mind; if it is too narrow, the transient response of the ﬁlter can create a spurious zero-crossing in the middle of the violation character, making it look like a conventional 0-1 sequence and causing the reader to fail to recognize the preamble.  415   Chapter 8  Figure 8.43: Tag-to-reader Packet Preamble When Using FM0 Encoding.  The pilot tone is particularly simple, being just a series of identical symbols, and helps the reader to identify the start of a tag reply. The pilot tone is not guaranteed to be unique: an EPC or other tag data could also contain 12 binary ‘0’ symbols in a row. However, as we shall see below, tags and readers operate under fairly strict timing requirements, so the period in which the reader searches for a pilot tone is not likely to be occupied by other symbols  at least when only one reader is operating in a given vicinity! . Whether the pilot tone is used or not is determined by another reader command parameter, TRext. A pilot tone can also help the reader detect collisions: if a pilot tone is recognized but no valid preamble is detected after it, the reader can guess that a collision occurred. We’ll take a closer look at collisions a bit later in the discussion.  When a tag is using MMS, the preamble and pilot tone are slightly different. The default preamble contains 4M cycles of the tag, equivalent to four consecutive binary ‘0’ symbols. Then, the sequence 0-1-0-1-1-1 is sent using whatever value of M is current. NO violation symbol is used. If TRext is set to 1 by the reader, the tag starts with 16M cycles  16 consecutive ‘0’ symbols, each M cycles long  instead of 4M.  8.5.4 Medium Access Control  Instead of the binary tree variants used by the ﬁrst-generation standards, the Gen 2 MAC approach is based on a slotted Aloha variant, originally known as the Q protocol. The basic scheme is:       The reader speciﬁes the number of slots in the inventory round  Each tag randomly chooses a location to reply within the round  416   UHF RFID Protocols            The reader issues short commands to mark the beginning of each slot within the round  If a tag has chosen that slot, it replies with a random number  If the reader can decipher the number and acknowledge it, the tag sends its EPC  The random number exchanged between tag and reader also allows the reader to maintain a unique logical session with that tag, independently of the tag’s EPC, or even whether it has a unique EPC. With the aid of this number, the handle, the reader can read from and write to the tag’s memory and perform other operations unique to that tag.  Let’s look in more detail at how this works. Recall, each tag has four 1-bit ﬂags correspond- ing to four sessions. To initiate an inventory, a reader issues a Query command pertaining to one of the four possible sessions  Figure 8.44 . The Query command contains a number of parameters, some of which control which tags will participate in the subsequent inventory. We will cover these in more detail later, so for the present, we can assume that a certain subset of tags hearing the Query command will consider themselves participants. The command also contains a numerical parameter, Q, which is of such interest that the protocol as originally proposed was named after it. Q speciﬁes the space in which the tags are to randomly distribute themselves and thus, also the number of slots in the upcoming inventory round. The ﬁrst step a participating tag takes is to create a random number whose value is between 0 and  2Q − 1 . This random number speciﬁes which slot the tag will respond. The number of slots available needs to be of the same order as the number of tags in the read zone: if there are  say  sixteen tags, 512 slots are a waste but one slot isn’t nearly enough. A complete set of 2Q slots constitutes an inventory round.  Figure 8.44: An Inventory Operation Starts with a Query Command; The Example Shown Assumes Q = 3. Tags Start in the Arbitrate State; See Figure 8.49 for Details of Tag States.  417   Chapter 8  The use of an exponentially expanding number space allows the single compact parameter Q to span a large range of possible tag population sizes. Q can take on values from 0 to 15, so only 4 bits are needed to specify its value, but this allows the protocol  at least in principle  to work smoothly with anything from 1 tag in the ﬁeld to 215 = 32 768 tags. Unlike the ISO 18000-6B COUNT protocol, the Q protocol can be quickly adapted for a wide variety of tag populations and can beneﬁt from a priori knowledge of the size of that population on the part of the user.  If a tag’s random number is equal to 0, the tag responds in this  ﬁrst  slot; otherwise, it records the value of this number in its slot counter and waits. The tag that rolls a 0 generates a new 16-bit random number RN16 and sends a short packet containing only the preamble  and pilot tone if applicable  plus the RN16 value  Figure 8.45 . This short packet has no error checking  that is, no parity bits or CRC  because the reader is going to echo the value back to the tag; if the value is wrong, the acknowledgement will simply fail and the inventory will continue. If the reader hears this reply packet in the right time period after the Query command, the reader sends an acknowledgement command, ACK, containing the same RN16. If the tag hears this packet and the RN16 is the value it just sent, it replies with a much longer packet containing its protocol control bits, EPC, and CRC16. An example of measured tag signals for such a sequence is depicted in  Figure 8.45: A Tag Whose Slot Counter is 0 Replies to the Reader with a Random Number. See Figure 8.49 For Tag State Details.  418   UHF RFID Protocols  Figure 8.46: Example of the Baseband Signal Resulting from a Tag Reply, Followed by an EPC.  Figure 8.46. At this point, the reader can choose to access this speciﬁc tag, to read from or write to various parts of the tag memory. The RN16 value exchanged between tag and reader allows them to create a unique logical session, even if many other tags are in hearing of the reader and even if the tag has no other unique identifying information.  If on the other hand, all the reader needed was the EPC of the tag, it can issue a new Query command, or  much more likely  a QueryRep. The QueryRep command is used to signal the end of a slot and thus is used very frequently. To maximize throughput, the QueryRep packet is very short: after the pilot tone preamble, the command is just two bits of binary ‘0’, followed by two bits describing which session the command applies to. When a tag that has just sent its EPC  and is thus, in the acknowledged, open, or secure states  hears a QueryRep in the session it has been operating in, it ﬂips the ﬂag corres- ponding to that session and returns to waiting for a new inventory. Other tags decrement their slot counters by 1 and start the process again. If no tag’s slot counter is 0, there is no reply in this slot, and the reader must issue another QueryRep. If a tag’s counter was at 1 and decrements to 0, it replies in that slot, and the process starts over again.  If more than 1 tag replies, there will be a collision—a garbled or indecipherable transmission. The reader may  or may not  be able to recognize the collision and distinguish it from an empty slot. An example of a collided response is shown in Figure 8.47. Because the pilot tone and preamble are identical between the two tags, and both are timed with respect to the end of the previous reader command, the pilot tone and preamble remain decipherable  if perhaps a bit distorted  even though more than one tag is talking. However, the random number values  RN16s  in the responses are different, so the result is a mess.  419   Chapter 8  Figure 8.47: Example of the Baseband Signal Resulting from a Collision Between Two or More Tags. Dotted Lines Show Symbol Timing Extracted from Pilot Tone.  Being able to unambiguously detect a collision and distinguish it from an empty slot and a valid tag reply, is very useful to the reader because after it ﬁnishes going through the inventory round of 2Q slots it needs to ﬁgure out what to do next. When it ﬁnishes a round, it has ﬁve options:  Increase the value of Q by 1 and do another round.      Leave the value of Q alone and do another round.   Decrease the value of Q by 1 and do another round.      Issue a new Query command with an arbitrary value of Q.  Stop.  The ﬁrst three options are accomplished by issuing a QueryAdjust command, which main- tains all the other parameters of the current inventory operation unchanged.  In general, the reader has no a priori means of knowing that all accessible tags have been counted. If most of the slots in the previous inventory round contained no reply, the value of Q probably ought to be reduced. If most of the slots in the previous inventory contained collisions, the value of Q ought to be increased. If around 30–50% of the slots contained decipherable replies, with the remainder being a mix of empty and collided slots, the value of Q was about optimal for the tag population; it might be prudent to repeat the same inventory, or optimistically assume that many tags were counted and reduce Q by 1 before trying again. Finally, if Q was previously a small value  e.g., 1 or 0  and no responses were seen, it is likely no tags are present and option 5 can be chosen. To make a good decision on the matter, the reader needs to know how many slots contained 0, 1, or 2 or more replies. It is also very helpful for throughput to be able to distinguish a good tag reply from a garbled tag reply because when the reader attempts an ACK with what turns out to be a  420   UHF RFID Protocols  bad RN16, it must then also listen for a valid reply with PC, EPC, and CRC, and having failed to ﬁnd one issues a NAK command to let the tags know that no tag was read. This process takes a lot longer than simply issuing a QueryRep at the end of an empty slot.  If all the tags to be addressed started in a speciﬁc state—for example, with the relevant session ﬂag set to state A—we should ideally complete this set of inventory rounds with all the session ﬂags ﬂipped to state B. Each tag in the read zone should have responded at least once and been heard and recorded; after being successfully read, the ﬂag should have been ﬂipped. Therefore, one ought to be able to validate that all tags have been counted using a procedure like  Figure 8.48 :    Count all the tags whose ﬂags are initially in state A;   Repeat the process targeting tags in state B    If the same tags are found, all tags have been counted; otherwise repeat.  However, in practice, the author has not found the world to be quite so simple. In addition to the obvious problem of some tags ﬁnding themselves in local fades and thus not receiving enough power to turn on, it appears that sometimes a tag will “leak” through the inventory: that is, a tag will ﬂip the session ﬂag even though the reader never counts it. There are at least a couple of ways this can happen. After a tag has sent its EPC, if it sees a QueryRep command, it assumes it was successfully read and ﬂips its session ﬂag. A QueryRep command has no error checking and is short. A tag receiving the reader only  Figure 8.48: Example of a Sequence of Inventories with Alternating Target Flag Values.  421   Chapter 8  marginally might mistake the ﬁrst two bits of another command, such as NAK, for the ‘00’ indicating a QueryRep, and erroneously ﬂip its ﬂag. Another mechanism has to do with the structure of the tag reply. The Protocol Control word that is sent before the EPC tells the reader how long the EPC is; we will discuss the details below in connection with the Gen 2 tag memory map. A reader using a relatively slow processor  which might be the case for a handheld or other battery-powered reader  may not be able to decipher the PC word in time to prepare itself properly for the EPC, and so may simply read the PC word and then issue another request to the tag for the EPC, having in the intervening time decoded the received data and prepared to capture the proper number of bits. However, since the command following the ﬁrst transmission of the EPC was not NAK, the tag may again assume it was counted and ﬂip its ﬂag if there is a bit error in decoding the subsequent command, as described above, doubling the likelihood of an error. In the author’s experience, to count a large number of tags, it is more efﬁcient and more effective to perform a series of inventories using the same target value but exploiting the option to use sessions with ﬂag values that persist through successive inventories. We’ll take a look at session persistence shortly.  The Gen 2 MAC approach is fast, ﬂexible, and relatively easy to implement. By changing the starting value of Q, we can operate in a Global-Scroll-like mode  Qstart = 0 or 1 , appropriate to a fast-moving conveyor with only one box near the reader antenna at any given time, or use a large Q value to deal with tens or even hundreds of simultaneous tags in the read zone. Any tag that hears a Query command can participate in the subsequent round, so late entry is not a problem. Tags are not singulated using their EPC, so the reader never sends the EPC value over the air, and tags with a zero-value EPC or a non EPC- compliant ID can still be singulated. The RN16 mechanism provides a way to maintain a logical session between the reader and a speciﬁc tag regardless of the state of the tag’s EPC. Since only one or a few tags reply in any given slot when Q is anywhere near a good value, and reader and tag transmission are separated in time, tag-to-tag interactions are unlikely to disturb operation of the protocol. Since the reader looks for the pilot tone and preamble before declaring a valid tag reply, and the reader must ﬁnd an RN16, ACK, and then see a valid reply before even attempting to read the EPC and check it against the CRC, the probability of ﬁnding a ghost tag—a false tag read in noise—is vanishingly small.1 Thus, the G2 MAC solves many of the outstanding problems encountered in the ﬁrst-generation protocols.  1 One can still construct scenarios in which a tag is incorrectly read without detection. For example, a real tag can reply to an ACK and be interrupted by a burst of interference that causes more than 16 bits to be garbled; in this case, there is a tiny chance that the CRC will randomly match the resulting noisy EPC. Such a scenario requires interference bursts infrequent enough to allow the RN16 handshake to proceed but frequent enough to disturb on the order of 216 ≈ 65000 tag responses in a period of interest.  422   UHF RFID Protocols  8.5.5 States and Commands  Gen 2 tag states are shown in Figure 8.49. The simplest path through the state diagram proceeds from Ready to Arbitrate upon receipt of a Query command. When the tag’s slot counter reaches zero, it transitions to Reply; if a valid ACK is received, the tag moves to Acknowledged, and then returns to Ready at the next slot boundary.  Figure 8.49: Gen 2 State Diagram.  The most commonly used commands are summarized below:  Query: This command launches a new inventory round. The 4-bit command code is 1000.  There are 22 bits total  after the pilot tone and preamble . Parameters:  423   Chapter 8    DR: this is the divide ratio we discussed above in connection with the uplink  symbols. See Table 8.1 and the associated discussion. DR is used along with the duration of the calibration symbol TRcal to determine the backscatter link frequency and by implication the data rate. Since there are only two allowed values  8 and 64 3 , this parameter only requires 1 bit.    M: the Miller subcarrier modulation index. See Figure 8.39 and discussion  thereabouts. TRcal, DR, and M together determine the backscatter data rate and the tag backscatter spectrum. There are four possible values so 2 bits of the command are devoted to M.              TRext: if this is set to 1, tag transmissions are preceded by a pilot tone of 12 binary ‘0’ symbols.  Sel: the Query can apply to only tags whose Select ﬂag is set, only tags whose Select ﬂag is cleared, or any tag. Two bits are required since there are three possibilities.  Session: Each Query command applies to one of four sessions.  That is, when a tag gets counted, this parameter sets which ﬂag gets ﬂipped.  Two bits are needed for the four sessions.  Target: each session ﬂag can be in either state A or B. For the session speciﬁed by the Session parameter, only tags whose ﬂag is in the Target state respond to the Query command.    Q: Q speciﬁes the size of the upcoming inventory round. Since Q can range  from 0 to 15, four bits are needed to specify it.    CRC5: A 5-bit cyclic redundancy check is appended to the Query since it is a long and relatively complex command. A tag does not respond to a Query whose CRC fails veriﬁcation.  QueryRep: This is the most commonly used of all commands and so is very short: only 4 bits. Two bits are the command code ‘00’, and the other two determine to which session this QueryRep applies. There are no other parameters.  QueryAdjust: This command launches a new inventory round, with all parameters  unchanged save the value of Q. This 9-bit command has the 4-bit command code ‘1001’ and two parameters:    Session: the session to which this adjustment applies. A tag only responds to a QueryAdjust if the session is the same as that of the most recent Query.  424   UHF RFID Protocols    UpDn: the value of Q can be increased by 1, unchanged, or decreased by 1.  Three bits are devoted to this parameter even though there are only three possible values; this provides simple error checking since the values are selected so that a single bit error in a valid choice always produces an invalid parameter value, which is ignored by the tag. Thus, it is fairly unlikely that the tag will adjust Q incorrectly.  ACK: The reader sends this to acknowledge that it has received an apparently valid RN16 and echo the value. It has the 2-bit code ‘10’, followed by the 16-bit random number the reader thinks it received from a responding tag. There is no error checking since the tag is already comparing the value in the ACK to the number it sent.  NAK: Not-an-ACK, with the relatively long moniker ‘11000000’. A NAK tells a replying  tag that its EPC was not successfully received. No ﬂags get ﬂipped. The tag that responded does not choose a new slot value; it will have to wait until the next inventory round before again replying.  Req-RN: Once a tag has been singulated, further exchanges with it are based on a second random number, called the tag’s handle. The reader obtains this value by Requesting a Random Number: Req-RN. This command can also be used to obtain random numbers for encoding reader transmissions. Encoding is achieved by bit-by-bit exclusive-or  XOR  of the data to be sent with the RN16 value; this is known as cover coding. The 8-bit command code ‘11000001’ is followed by the tag’s 16-bit RN or handle  if one has already been sent  and a 16-bit CRC for error checking. The tag replies with a new RN16 value, also sent with a 16-bit CRC.  Read: This command can read from any memory area that is not locked against reading. The command code is ‘11000010’. The length of the command is not ﬁxed because the memory address to be read is described by an extensible bit vector  EBV , as described in Figure 8.30, but it is at least 56 bits long, and thus, would hardly be appropriate as part of a high-speed inventory process. Parameters are:   Bank: any of the four memory banks; two bits.   WordPtr: the starting address of the memory segment to be read, as an EBV.   WordCount: the number of 16-bit words to be read. Since this is an 8-bit  parameter, up to 255 words can be read.    RN: this is the handle of the tag to be read.   CRC16: error check on the command.  425   Chapter 8  Access: The Access command is used to request a tag handle, or an RN16 for cover coding. When the tag has received a valid Access command, it transitions to the Open state  if the tag’s Access password is 0  or to the Secured state if the password is nonzero and correctly provided. Open and Secured both allow data to be read and written, but only in the Secured state can a tag’s memory be locked. Parameters are:    Password: The 32-bit password is sent cover coded, and in two 16-bit halves in consecutive Access commands.    RN: the handle or RN16 of the tag being addressed.   CRC16: error check on the command.  Write: The default command for writing to tag memory works one 16-bit word at a time. The syntax is very similar to that of Read, except that the WordCount is replaced by the 16 bits of cover-coded data. For good security, the reader should request a new RN16 code key prior to each Write operation.  We have left the Select command for last although it is often the ﬁrst command issued because of its complex usage and syntax. The idea behind the command is to provide a ﬂexible means by which to select a subset of all possible tags for inventory. Successive Select commands can be combined, allowing complex Boolean operations based on the contents of the tag memory to deﬁne the desired subset. The syntax of the command is summarized in Figure 8.50. The Target parameter speciﬁes which of the ﬁve ﬂag values is to be modiﬁed based on this command. There are eight possible Action codes, and each code has a different effect depending on whether the target is a session ﬂag or the SL ﬂag, and whether a given tag’s memory data matches Mask bits or not. The Mask is a bit sequence of up to 256 bits to be matched to a segment of the tag memory. The relevant segment is speciﬁed by the MemBank, the Pointer  indicating the start of the relevant bit sequence , and the Length. Note, Bank 00 cannot be used for Select commands. Finally, the Truncate parameter can be used to cause the tag to issue an abbreviated EPC during the subsequent inventory if it is set to ‘1’ on the last Select command before the inventory begins.  Because the ﬂag states are preserved between commands, sequential Selects can be used to implement Boolean operations. For example, we can choose tags with a speciﬁc vendor  Manager  code and either of two model numbers  SKUs  by using two Select commands, each containing the same Manager but different SKUs in the mask, and each targeting the SL ﬂag with action “assert” for matching and “deassert” for nonmatching tags  that is, action code ‘000’ . The Boolean AND can be implemented for noncontiguous memory  426   UHF RFID Protocols  Figure 8.50: Syntax of the Select Command. Assert Sets the SL Flag, and Deassert Resets it. Toggle Inverts the State of the Flag.  segments using successive “assert” or “set” actions for matching tags with no action for nonmatching tags. An exclusive-OR  XOR  results from using “toggle” action codes.  The simplest Select operations are the most reliable. Complex sequences of commands are allowed by the standard, but the user should remember that the more commands are used, the more likely it is that a tag will fail to receive at least one member of the sequence.  The reader may ﬁnd it informative to explore the OneTagWorld simulator included on the CD, which emulates most of the functions of a Gen 2 tag communicating with a reader.  8.5.6 Normal Operation and Key User Parameters  Starting Q: in normal operation of the Gen 2 protocol, tags power up into the Ready state. Although the standard is written implying that at least one Select command will precede any inventory operation, there is no requirement that this be done, and inventories can be launched immediately upon power up. The reader then issues a Query command. The ﬁrst Query is a step into the unknown for the reader, which has no a priori means of knowing what’s waiting to be read. However, this may not be the case for the user. It is often true that the rough number of readable tags is known prior to the beginning of an inventory. A conveyor may be set up so as to allow only one or two tags to be present in the read zone at any given time. A forklift load passing through a portal may have a known  427   Chapter 8  number of tagged cases and a single pallet tag. If the user knows about how many tags are present, they can short-circuit a lot of work by the reader by specifying the starting value of Q, which is usually provided as a parameter in the reader software. The ideal value of Q is around 1.5 times as large as the number of tags, but since only powers of 2 are avail- able, the starting value can’t be chosen very precisely and needn’t be that accurate  see Table 8.2 . A starting value of 5 or 6 will work ﬁne for anything from around 25 to 100 tags, both because the protocol is robust and because the reader will adjust the value of Q based on the results of the ﬁrst inventory or two. However, a starting value of 0 or 1 will not work very well with a large reader population; the reader may have a hard time seeing anything intelligible in the mess of collisions that results and decide it is done without reading any tags. Similarly a starting value of 6 or 7 in a high-speed conveyor environment is likely to result in a series of empty inventory rounds; if the read zone is limited by  say  a misoriented box or a challenging metallic object inside, the tag may be past the reader before it gets a chance to attempt a response.

Truly simultaneous independent sessions are not possible because there is only one slot counter, and it is always reset whenever a tag hears a Query command, whether or not another inventory was in progress in a different session. Truly interpenetrating inventories would constantly reset tag slot counters, causing tags to leak out of an inventory round and making it difﬁcult for the readers to adapt their Q values. To make use of this capability, it is also necessary for the competing users to create some sort of convention about how the sessions are allocated amongst various readers since nothing is accomplished if two readers address the same session ﬂag.  428   UHF RFID Protocols  Of perhaps, equal importance in managing inventories is session persistence  Table 8.3 . In general, the state of a tag IC is preserved while power is supplied but lost  except for its nonvolatile memory  when power is lost.  Recall that power will generally be lost when the reader executes a frequency hop and may also be lost due to local fading as the tag, reader, and other objects in the vicinity move around.  However, the Gen 2 standard requires that the session ﬂags have persistence, and that the different sessions have differing properties in this regard. All inventory ﬂags default to A when a tag powers up after an extended siesta. The state of the Session 0 ﬂag persists indeﬁnitely when tag power is on, but the state of the ﬂag is lost immediately when tag power is lost. Session 1 has a ﬁxed and limited persistence even when tag power is on; if the ﬂag has not been refreshed by an inventory operation in more than the persistence time  up to 5 seconds  it will reset the ﬂag to A, unless an inventory is actually in progress when the persistence timer runs out. Sessions 2 and 3 persist indeﬁnitely when tag power is available and for at least 2 seconds after power is lost.  The author has observed actual persistence times of up to 60 seconds on commercial Gen 2 tags in sessions 2 and 3.  The Select ﬂag state also persists for at least 2 seconds when power is lost.  Persistent sessions can make a considerable contribution to inventory performance when a large number of tags is present in the read zone, and fading is not negligible  so that not all tags are readable at a given moment . Let us imagine that we wish to count  say  100 tags. We provide a reasonable starting Q value of 7 and tell the reader to inventory the tags. The reader may execute a series of inventory rounds with  for example  Q = 7,7,6, 5,4,3,2,1,0, ﬁnding no reply on the ﬁnal round and terminating that series; the set might consume 100 millisecond. Some subset—say 50—of the tags present are read. The reader then executes a frequency hop and starts the process again. Since the ﬂag state has been lost, the 50 tags that were counted previously are quite likely to participate again and be counted again—a useless waste of reader time and resources if all we need is the fact of the count and not its frequency. In the course of a second or two, we might count many of the tags ﬁve or ten times in order to achieve one count of the small number of tags with poorer response. If in contrast we perform the same operation in Session 2, each tag  Flag S0 S1 S2 S3 SL  Table 8.3: Tag Flag Persistence Behaviour.  Persistence: Tag Power On  Persistence: Tag Power Lost  Indeﬁnite  500 ms < t < 5 s  Indeﬁnite Indeﬁnite Indeﬁnite  429  500 ms < t < 5 s  none  t > 2 s t > 2 s t > 2 s   Chapter 8  that is counted remembers this fact. As long as the Query target is unchanged  say, A , subsequent inventories will address only tags that have not been inventoried. As we proceed, the population of participating tags will become smaller and their chance to reply larger. No time is wasted recounting tags, and the whole countable population will be rapidly surveyed.  The author has found that both the time required to count a large tag population and the number of tags that are missed or marginally counted are substantially reduced when persistent sessions are used. Because of the small but ﬁnite possibility that a tag can “leak” through an inventory, ﬂipping its ﬂag despite not having actually been counted, it is also a good policy to carry out alternate series of persistent inventories with different targets. That is, one might count for 500 millisecond or 1 second with a session S2 and target A, and then count for an additional 500 millisecond with the same session but target B. Any tags leaking through the ﬁrst set are discovered in the second set, and the chances of an exhaustive count are improved.  Because tag states are persistent, possibly for seconds or tens of seconds, inventory results can be history dependent. This fact is important to note in applications where consecutive reads of the same tag may have differing goals or consequences. For example, if a case tag is read on a conveyor to record the fact that the case is present and then to be read a few seconds later after the case has been sorted onto another belt, if a persistent session is used, and if both stations use the same session and target, the case may be missed due to ﬂag persistence. Choosing an alternate target risks the same consequence if the time between reads is comparable to the persistence time. When history matters, it is prudent to select nonpersistent sessions for inventory.  Reading and Writing: because tag memory organization is speciﬁed by the Gen 2 protocol, reading from and writing to tag memory can be expected to be independent of the tag IC vendor. Reading from memory is fairly straightforward, except to note that it is possible to lock bank 00  the password bank  against reading as well as writing. Once this has been done, there is no way to recover the password values. We will discuss locking in a bit more detail below.  Writing a new EPC to a tag requires a few words about the structure of the protocol control  PC  word. This is shown in Figure 8.51. The ﬁrst 5 bits of the PC word describe the length of the EPC in 16-bit words. A 96-bit EPC is 6 words long. For a default EPCglobal tag, this is the only nonzero portion of the PC word. Thus, for a 96-bit EPC, the protocol word in hexadecimal notation is 30h, as shown in the ﬁgure. If bit 8 is set to 1, the PC word includes an ISO-compliant Application Family Identiﬁer  AFI . The AFI value is assigned depending on the general class of use for the object the tag identiﬁes and  430   UHF RFID Protocols  Figure 8.51: Protocol Control  PC  Word Structure. RFU = Reserved for Future Use.  is generally used as a vendor-independent ﬁltering mechanism  i.e. as part of a Select mask  to include only tags pertaining to a certain type of use.  Using the default Write command, the bytes of the PC and EPC are written into memory words 1 through 7 of bank 01  for a 96-bit EPC . Note that this requires issuance of one command for each word written. Memory word 0, containing the CRC, is calculated by the tag each time it powers up, and thus there is no need to write a value there. The optional BlockWrite command writes multiple words in a single command, without using forward-link cover coding. At the time of this writing not all commercial tags support BlockWrite. The related optional command BlockErase allows more than one word of memory to be cleared in a single command.  Locking Memory: Gen 2 has a sophisticated tag memory security system. All Gen 2 tags have a 32-bit Access Password stored in the Reserved memory bank, 00. When a tag is singulated, it enters one of two states. If the Access Password is all zeros, the tag goes to the Secured state. If the password is nonzero, the tag passes to the Open state. An Open tag can be Secured by providing this Access Password to the tag. A Secured tag allows more control over its memory than an Open tag. The exact privileges that are granted depend on the lock states  to be described shortly  of the different memory banks. Only Secured tags allow changing of these lock states.  431   Chapter 8  All tag memory banks can be locked, which is useful to prevent unauthorized access to tag memory. For example, customers can be kept from changing the EPC of a retail item in order to modify its price. The Access and Kill passwords, both of which reside in the Reserved memory bank, can be locked independently. There are therefore 5 total regions that can be locked: EPC, TID and User memory banks, and the Access and Kill Passwords. Each of these regions have 2 bits to control their lock state: Pwd and Permalock. Each region can therefore be in one of four lock states, as shown in Table 8.4. For the Access and Kill passwords, locking restricts writing and reading. For the other regions  EPC, TID, and User memory banks , locking only restricts writing. Once Permalock has been set for a region, the lock status for that region can never be altered.  Pwd  Permalock  Description  Table 8.4: Memory Lock Bits.  0 0  1 1  0 1  0 1  Memory is writeable with or without Access Password. Memory is permanently writeable with or without Access Password. It may NEVER be locked. Memory is ONLY writeable with Access Password. Memory is permanently NOT writeable with or without Access Password.  It may NEVER be unlocked.  The Lock command provides a mask that allows the user to set each of the lock permalock bits for all the banks and the two passwords. Once a permalock bit is set, it can, of course, not be reset.  It is important to note that the lock status of the tag memory is explicitly speciﬁed as unreadable. Lock status can only be inferred as a result of attempts to read from or write to memory segments.  Kill Command: tags can be killed if they have a nonzero Kill password; a compliant Killed tag is required to no longer respond to any command, unlike some earlier tags in which the kill command merely erased memory. The Kill and Access passwords are both 32 bits long, so there is little danger of a dictionary attack succeeding on individual tags. Like Access, the Kill command sends the password in two 16-bit halves, each protected by cover-coding with a 16-bit random number.  Providing unique Kill and Access passwords to individual tags represents a substantial password management problem. In many cases, it can expected that large classes of tags will share the same passwords, and the labor required to mount a dictionary attack might be more readily justiﬁed. For example, a parallel assault on 100 tags at 10 tries second  432   UHF RFID Protocols  would crack a password in about a month. Preliminary results from researchers at the Weizmann Institute also suggest that power analysis attacks to extract passwords may be possible on individual tags; see Further Reading for more information.  8.5.7 Protocol Performance and Link Timing  How fast can a tag be read? In order to answer this question, we need to take into account the peak data rates and the amount of data to be sent over both directions of the link. We also need to take into account certain delays built into the protocol. These delays are shown in Figure 8.52. The ﬁrst speciﬁed timing limitation is imposed upon the reader; it must wait at least twice RTcal after a command with no reply  like a Select  before issuing another command. Since RTcal is roughly twice the duration of an average reader symbol, this delay corresponds to only about four reader bits and has a modest impact on long commands like Select; in addition, it doesn’t arise for commands like Query where a reply is expected, so we can ignore it in our peak performance analysis. After a Query or QueryRep, the tag must wait at least T1, which is the larger of RTcal or 10 cycles of the  Figure 8.52: Gen 2 Link Timing Summary.  433   Chapter 8  FM0 carrier. Which is it? The shortest value of RTcal that is allowed for the shortest value of Tari  6.25 microseconds  is 2.5 Tari = 15.6 microseconds. The fastest BLF is 640 kHz, corresponding to a cycle time Tpri of 1.56 microseconds, so that—surprise!—the two constraints are identical. The tag should reply within 15–16 microseconds after the Query command is complete. If there is a reply, the reader must acknowledge it within no more than 20 Tpri = 32 microseconds. If everything goes smoothly, the tag will again wait 15 microseconds after the ACK to reply.  Assuming the minimum Tari and maximum BLF  with divide ratio 64 3 , the pream- ble for each reader command takes 67 microseconds; a frame sync takes a bit less  34 microseconds  since there is no TRcal symbol. During full-speed operation, the reader will be sending only QueryRep, ACK, and when things don’t work out, NAK. Treating a typical bit as 1.25 Tari and multiplying by the command length in bits, we can estimate the duration of the reader commands. Assuming no pilot tone and FM0, we can estimate the time taken for the tag to reply. Putting everything together  Table 8.5 , we get the total time for one successful slot to be about 581 microseconds, with most of the time taken by the ACK command and the long tag reply. This time corresponds to a maximum possible rate of 1720 slots per second.  Can the protocol really run this fast? Even in the ideal case, the use of a random MAC protocol means that it is not possible for every slot to be ﬁlled with exactly 1 tag. Let us, for example, assume that every other slot is empty. When a slot is empty, the reader issues a QueryRep, waits for T1 plus the duration of the preamble, and then some hardware-dependent time  we’ll guess 9–10 microseconds for the sake of a round number  to decide that no tag has responded and issue another QueryRep; that means an empty slot consumes 100 microseconds. In this case, the actual tag read rate will be about 1470 tags second.  Table 8.5: Timing for a Single Inventory Slot. Assumptions: Tari = 6.25 ms, BLF = 640 kHz, RTcal = 2.5 Tari, TRext = 0.  Duration  μs   Cumulative Duration  μs   Step  QueryRep  Tag RN16  T1  T2 ACK T1  T2  Tag PC+ EPC+ CRC  66 16 36 31 175 16 211 31  434  66 81 117 148 323 339 550 581   UHF RFID Protocols  In the real case, there are some substantial obstacles to sustained operation at this speed, some having to do with the protocol itself and some with hardware issues. Except in the case when only one tag per inventory attempt is guaranteed, the reader doesn’t know exactly how many tags are present and can’t choose a perfect value of Q; we must expect some slots to contain collisions. In most collisions, the reader will still be able to extract a preamble and  erroneous  RN16. The reader will then ACK with an invalid random number, to which neither tag will reply. This will consume an extra 200 microseconds, representing a quite substantial slowdown if collisions are at all frequent  as must sometimes be the case while we are adjusting the value of Q . That’s the good news. A much more substantial slowdown occurs when a bit error happens during a valid tag reply. The reader and tag spend one full slot time to ﬁnd out that a bad EPC + CRC was received, after which the tag must in addition issue a NAK  which takes another 130 microseconds or so  before it can start a new slot. The net read rate is reduced by the percentage of reads containing bit errors. Since the long reply contains about 130 bits, a −3 is required to keep the tag reply error rate below 20%. To bit error rate of less than 10 reduce the number of bit errors, one ought to use a lower backscatter link frequency and higher value of M  to narrow the spectrum of the tag reply, and thus the receiver baseband ﬁlter width , but, of course, this reduces the tag data rate and slows reads.  The timing requirements imposed on the link are also challenging, particularly for handheld  battery-powered readers with limited computational capability. At full link speed, the reader has 31 microseconds to determine whether a valid preamble was received, demodulate the RN16, validate that it wishes to send an ACK, and formulate and transmit the command.  These times can be stretched a bit by clever software design, demodulating the bits as they are received, and constructing the reader command at the same time.  A low-cost 500-MHz processor and 5× oversampling, assuming four computations per sample, give us around 30 processor cycles per computation, not including memory access and conditional execution times. If a low-power 100-MHz processor is all we have, we’re down to 6 cycles per sample. So while it’s quite possible for a reader to operate at the full rate, it is demanding of computational resources and limits the sophistication of data processing algorithms that can be applied.  The use of dense interrogator modes puts further constraints on the data rates, not related to the limitations of the hardware but to regulatory conditions. In order to place most of the tag spectrum at the boundaries of a channel  United States operation  or in an alternate channel  ETSI operation , the backscatter link frequency is constrained to equal the desired offset from the carrier: around 240 kHz for the United States, or 200 kHz for Europe. Furthermore, in order to make sure that most of the spectrum power is away from the carrier, a Miller index of 4 or 8 is desirable, further reducing the actual tag data rate. Finally, the reader data rate must also be limited to keep the transmitted spectrum narrow.  435   Chapter 8  Fortunately, the ﬂexibility allowed by the protocol lets readers adjust tag and reader data rates for optimal performance, given the resources available and the read range desired. Readers the author has worked with have demonstrated peak rates of 200–500 tags second for populations of 50–100 tags in the read zone, under FCC conditions. This is much faster than the values for ﬁrst-generation tags in comparable circumstances.  8.5.8 Concluding Remarks  UHF tag protocols have come a long way since the early work at Sandia Laboratories. The Class 1 Generation 2 protocol demands a rather sophisticated tag IC, but in exchange, it provides a number of beneﬁts:    Unique tag sessions based on 16-bit random number handles, independent of the  tag’s unique identiﬁer;  Long passwords for memory lock and tag kill;  Simple encryption for memory write operations;          Ghost  phantom  tags are nearly eliminated;   Dense populations of collocated readers can operate simultaneously with minimal  Support for late-arriving tags;  interference;           Flexible, persistent sessions allow efﬁcient sequential inventories with minimal rereads of tags already counted;  Protocol-speciﬁed memory maps and terminology ensure interoperable memory reads and writes;  Flexible ability to lock memory banks temporarily or permanently.  It seems likely at this time that Gen 2, having also been endorsed by ISO as 18000-6C, will be widely implemented and become one of the dominant protocols for passive UHF RFID.  The ﬂexibility that makes the protocol powerful also makes it relatively complex to imple- ment; a Gen 2 chip requires about ﬁve times as many transistors as a Gen 1 chip. This  436   UHF RFID Protocols  means that while absolute prices for the ICs may continue to fall, they will always be more expensive than a simpler protocol would require.  If the Gen 2 standard has a substantial area of weakness, it is in security and privacy. The EPC itself can be read by any compliant reader, regardless of lock states. There is no provision for reader authentication or hash security for the EPC; if the EPC itself contains any information of value to an attacker, it is easily obtained. Cover coding is reasonably secure if the tag transmissions can’t be detected, and the reader uses a new random number to encode every packet, but this is hardly absolute security. The author has intercepted tag transmissions from about 5–7 m using a 13-dBi Yagi-Uda antenna and a spectrum analyzer; with more appropriate equipment, it is likely a tag near a reader could be heard from some tens of meters away, or through a wall or two. Current tag ICs are also vulnerable to power-sensing attacks, making the passwords susceptible to extraction, particularly if  as is likely  a large number of tags share a password. While these limitations are of modest import in standard supply-chain tracking, for which Gen 2 was primarily designed, they represent challenges for security-based applications  e.g. in anticounterfeiting agents for pharmaceuticals and other goods  and in applications where privacy is important  such as library loans or consumer item purchases . It seems reasonable to anticipate that future passive tag protocols will increasingly incorporate security and privacy protections, as continued progress in IC technology makes more logical capability available at the same DC power.  8.6 Capsule Summary  All communications protocols are based on conventions agreed upon by the parties invo- lved, specifying the medium of communication, the message format, access to the medium, and interpretation of the resulting data. Once the choice of electromagnetic transmission is made, practical and regulatory considerations limit the choices available for passive long-range RFID to a few frequency bands. These choices, and the limited computational capabilities of passive tags, constrain the properties of the wireless medium. Within those constraints, a protocol designer must choose what symbols to use, whether and how they are assembled into packets or frames, how to manage access for an unknown tag population, and what data to put on the tag.  Early protocols validated the use of frequency-shift-keyed tag symbols and amplitude-shift- keyed reader symbols, cyclic redundancy checks for error detection, and limiting tag data to identifying information. Collision resolution was limited to a persistent Quiet state for tags that have been counted.  437   Chapter 8  The Auto-ID Laboratories’ Class 0 and Class 1 protocols, even though never fully standard- ized, made signiﬁcant contributions to the tool kit for tag protocols, adding sophisticated command sets and tag states, ﬁeld-writeable tag memory, and binary tree medium access control for inventorying large populations of tags in a manageable time. ISO 18000-6B introduced the use of a simple slotted Aloha MAC algorithm, FM0 tag coding, and sophisticated tag subset selection.  Implementation of these early protocols also exposed important weaknesses and obstacles to wider use: inﬂexible data rates, incompatible memory implementation, intolerance of late-entering tags, ghost tags, lack of link-level security, reader–reader interference, and lack of a mechanism for talking to a tag independently of its unique ID. The Class 1 Generation 2 standard attempts to address all of these issues. Memory mapping and terminology is speciﬁed in the protocol. Gen 2 provides great  perhaps excessive  ﬂexibility in tag and reader data rates and special modulation and coding for interference mitigation. An enhanced Aloha-type MAC can adapt to varying tag population sizes while being friendly to late- arriving tags. Complex subset management is available using multiple sequential Select commands. Stringent multiple-step timing requirements make ghost tags unlikely. Tags use random numbers to manage unique logical sessions with a reader, irrespective of the contents of their EPC memory. Long passwords protect the memory-lock and tag-kill functions. Simple forward-link encryption makes interception more difﬁcult.  Future enhancements of passive protocols are likely to include enhanced authentication, privacy, and security functions.  8.7 Further Reading  8.7.1 General Communications Protocols  “Understanding Data Communications  6th edition ”, G.

A parity check bit is embedded after each 8-bit byte of the ID code. The ID code is followed by a 16-bit CRC. What percentage of the tag message is devoted to formatting and error checking instead of sending data?  The IOC is organized into working groups. Working group RPD-1  Rate Perform- ance Disparagement  has tabled a proposal for providing tags with the option of replying with only the preamble, ID, and CRC, also eliminating the parity check digits. The working group is now stuck since the British members believe that tabling refers to bringing a measure up for consideration, whereas the American members understand the term to mean that the proposal has been abandoned, the European members are on vacation for 36 weeks, and the Asian members are too busy making products to attend the meetings. Let’s help them out. If the reader command causing a tag to reply with its ID requires 48 bits and is transmitted at half the rate of the tag reply, and a four-reader-bit gap is speciﬁed between reader command and tag reply and prior to another command, how much can throughput be improved by the tabled proposal?  %  %  Is this improvement worth calling the European members back from the Mediterranean beaches?  NO YES It’s winter, they’re in the Alps  8.2. To the consternation of visually impaired2 Committee Chair Toulouse Track, all  the 124 voting members have shown up at the meeting to vote on whether “tabling” should be interpreted according to the British, American, or Icelandic conventions3. Dr. Track decides to allocate the right to speak based on a slotted Aloha approach. He will ask each participant to choose a random number between 1 and 100 and write it down on the tablet of paper next to their glass of ice water. He will then ﬂip a coin to decide whether to count up from 0 or down from 100 and call out numbers in the resulting sequence for each participant to speak. Each member will then have 1 minute to state their case favoring or opposing the resolution. If no one speaks for 10 seconds after a number is  2 One of many consequences of the embarrassing incident involving laser surgical modiﬁcation of the cornea, a toy caboose, and Miss Cody Pendant from Twelve-Step Temporary Employment Agency.  3 Reputed to involve indecent use of geothermal energy.  441   Chapter 8  called, Dr. Track will go on to the next number. In the event that two or more members have chosen the same number, they will all speak simultaneously. Dr. Track will record that a collision occurred, draft a memo regretting the fact to be delivered to the IOC Intellectual Property Manager, Pat N. Pending, and go on to the next slot. What is the likelihood that there will be no collisions?  100%  10%  5%  0%  If there are ten 2-person collisions, three 3-person collisions, and one each with 11 people  the number ‘1’  and nine people  the number ‘100’ , how long does it take for Dr. Track to get through all the allocated slots, assuming a 5-second inter-slot gap for Dr. Track to call out the next number?  minutes  Would it have been more efﬁcient to hold the meeting underwater using American Sign Language, or would that choice have a prejudicial impact on the result of deliberations?  YES  PROBABLY  WHAT?  First-Generation Standards:  8.3. In Singapore, unlicensed RFID operation is allowed in the band 923–925 MHz. Is it possible to choose a 500-MHz channel in this band for reader transmission to ensure that Class 0 tag signals are also in the band?  YES  NO  8.4. A Class 0 reader using a symbol time of 25 microseconds and ID2 to singulate tags is counting tags with 128-bit IDs. How long does it take for the reader to receive a complete tag ID and error check?  microseconds  8.5. A Class 0 reader monitors a conveyor. Tagged boxes on the conveyor are within the read zone for 1 second; on average, boxes are spaced apart by 3 m and move at 1 m per second. The reader continuously reads at full speed as in problem 4 above, simply discarding reads whose CRC and ID do not agree, and stopping every 100 milliseconds to issue a RESET and calibration sequence for  442   UHF RFID Protocols  new-entering tags. If the reader 24 hours per day, and assuming no actual metaphysical intervention, how many ghost tags will it detect in a week?  tags  %  8.6. A Class 1 reader monitors the same conveyor, in Global Scroll mode. To save time, no mask bits are used in the reader command. Production worker Amon Breick carelessly leaves an extra tag on the table close to the reader antenna, so that this tag replies to every ScrollAllID command, and its backscatter signal is much larger than that of tags on the conveyor. How many conveyor tags will be read under these conditions?  To avoid catastrophic failure when Amon is not on break, the reader software is modiﬁed to issue a Quiet command to each tag that is successfully read, so that another tag can participate. If the reader issues a Quiet command, with the 96-bit ID of the tag included in the mask, each time it successfully reads a tag, and the remainder of the command  other than the mask bits  takes 1 millisecond to send, what is the impact on the peak read rate?

This book has focused almost exclusively on physical-layer operation of tags and readers using radiative coupling. We have only touched on the variety of inductively coupled RFID technologies and protocols that are more appropriate for many important applications. We have left for others to illuminate the vital topic of how the voluminous data collected by a network of readers is converted into useful knowledge for the enterprise they serve. We have left unexamined, save by citation, the important social issues surrounding the effect of radio frequency identiﬁcation on privacy and personal security as well as the security of corporate data.  The reader may wish to remedy these omissions by taking advantage of the many existing resources in the physical library and on the web, some of which have been listed in the current tome. In doing so, the reader may proceed with conﬁdence that what was absent yesterday will be available tomorrow: A search on the keyword “RFID” in the IEEE’s digital library in late 2003 produced only about 100 citations; in early 2007, only three years later, over 900 documents now result from the same request.  I hope you’ve found this book informative, and perhaps on occasion as entertaining as a technical tome can hope to be. I’d like to offer thanks again to the many people who helped, and accept responsibility for the inevitable errors of commission and omission.

Dobkin  Sunnyvale, CA  March 19, 2007  445   This page intentionally left blank   APPENDIX 1  Radio Regulations  A1.1 Couldn’t Wait for Global Warming In April of 1912, the great passenger linear Titanic glanced off an iceberg on its maiden voyage from Great Britain to the United States. The Titanic was equipped with the most advanced wireless communications available in its day, but so were many of the ships that plied the north Atlantic in those days. While cold winter weather, arrogance, optimistic planning, and a lost pair of binoculars were the proximate causes of the disaster, the lack of regulations regarding radio usage and interference avoidance made a contribution to its severity.  This much-publicized tragedy catalyzed the end of the anarchy in the use of wireless at sea and the beginning of regulation of broadcasting in general. In August of 1912, a US law gave the Secretary of Commerce the responsibility of administering licensing of radio stations within the United States. Broadcast radio in the United States arose around 1921, and the initial legal framework recognized de facto possession of spectrum as constituting a property right: the ﬁrst broadcaster in any jurisdiction to broadcast in a given frequency band owned the spectrum they transmitted in. However, confusion and contrary court decisions caused this simple guideline to falter, leading to broadcast anarchy and interference with popular stations in major broadcast markets. In 1927, the US Congress passed the Radio Act, which estab- lished a Federal Radio Agency with responsibility for stewardship of spectrum; seven years later the Congress replaced the FRA with the Federal Communications Commission  FCC . The FCC through its early years followed a strict command-and-control regulatory model, in which licenses for spectrum were granted only for speciﬁc uses in speciﬁc locations, with no rights to trade, modify, or assign the license.  Almost all other nations in the world followed suit in establishing a national agency to regulate the use of the radio and microwave spectrum. Coordination between these agencies is today provided by the International Telecommunications Union  ITU , which operates under the auspices of the United Nations. The ITU gathers the national regulatory agencies once every three years at the World Radiocommunications Conference  WRC , which like most such exercises generates only slow and painful progress towards world consensus on the regulation of radio technology.  447   Appendix 1  Regulatory attitudes began to change in the 1980s, as the mantra of deregulation slowly spread through American government and politics. In 1985, the FCC approved the use of Industrial, Scientiﬁc, and Medical  ISM  spectrum at 900 MHz and 2.4 GHz  and a bit around 5 GHz  for unlicensed use, with limitations on power, allowed modulation techniques, and antenna gain to minimize consequent interference. Additional spectrum around 5 GHz, known as the Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure  UNII  band was made available in 1997. Similar actions were being taken by other regulatory agencies around the world. The manifest success of these actions in promoting innovative use of spectrum induced the FCC to make additional 5 GHz spectrum available in 2003  Figure 3.15 , as well as to allow ultrawideband radios to operate without licenses in spectrum previously reserved for other uses  Figure 3.27 .  The proper model for regulation of spectrum usage is a topic of active debate within and outside of governments. The success of unlicensed spectrum has demonstrated the feasibility of a ‘commons’ model in which neither detailed use regulations nor property rights are applied; the success of the auctioned spectrum used for cellular telephony has demonstrated the utility of a market in spectrum rights. Both models are arguably superior to the command- and-control model practiced for most of the 20th century.  It is important to recall the physics that frames the changing debate. The 1912 Act in the United States dealt with radio wavelengths in the range of 10 s of meters to over 1600 meters  that is, from 10 s of kHz to around 10 MHz . Buildings and even small mountains represent subwavelength obstacles at these frequencies. Diffraction is easy, absorption is small, and very high powers were often used. Direct ranges of tens to hundreds of kilometers are typical. The lower frequencies are below the plasma frequency of the ionosphere  the layer of partially- ionized gas that lies above the stratosphere , and thus are reﬂected by it, so that they can hop across hundreds or thousands of kilometers. That is, early radio stations broadcast everywhere, limited only by radiated power, and interference was intrinsically a public issue.  By contrast, the transmissions of RFID readers and tags are much easier to corral. For indoor networks, low radiated power, combined with good antenna management and a helpful building  thick concrete or wooden walls and conductive-coated windows  can keep most of the radiated power within a single structure. In many locations, foliage provides a strong limitation on outdoor propagation distance except for line-of-sight applications. Management of interference becomes much more akin to a local property right, administered by property owners for indoor networks and perhaps by local authorities  city or county governments  for outdoor networks. There is less need and less justiﬁcation for government intervention in radio operation in these circumstances.  As communications evolves towards the use of still higher frequencies, with more intelligent radios and antennas, it can be expected that the laws and codes regulating the use of radio will  448   Radio Regulations  continue to evolve as well. It is to be hoped that further innovation will produce more ways of identifying objects at lower cost as a result. That’s the fun part; the remainder of this appendix is necessarily best suited for curing insomnia, though still less so than the original documents. Only the brave need continue.  A1.2 FCC PART 15  Use of unlicensed spectrum in the United States and other countries is not unregulated. Limitations are placed on total power, modulation approaches, antennas, and conditions of operation, in an attempt to minimize interference within the intended band. Further limitation of radiated and conducted emissions  that is, stuff that sneaks back into the AC power system through the equipment power cord  is imposed to minimize interference outside of the intended bands.  The regulations of the FCC are contained in Title 47 of the US code of Federal regulations. Part 15 deals with operation of unlicensed radio transmitters. Equipment must generally be approved prior to marketing, and labeled as such when sold  15.19 ; the main thrust of the approval process is to ensure that the regulations regarding interference are met by the equipment. Users are responsible to see that the limitations in the regulations are met during operation. A table summarizing some of the key aspects relevant to RFID applications is provided below, based on the revision of these regulations released August 14, 2006. Some of the choices in modulation and architecture made in the various protocols may become clearer on review of the relevant regulations. Of particular interest are ISM-band regulations  15.247 . This table is meant to help the reader understand what the law is so as to remain within it; when in doubt, review the original text  available at the Government Printing Ofﬁce website, www.access.gpo.gov , or seek legal counsel if appropriate.  For equipment installer, it is important to consider speciﬁc restrictions and loopholes. The intent of the regulatory apparatus for unlicensed radios is stated in 15.5, paragraph  b : an unlicensed radio must not create harmful interference, and must accept any interference it encounters. The basic framework followed to ensure this result is to require certiﬁcation of all unlicensed equipment before sale  15.201 . Furthermore, the rules seek to allow the use of only those antennas and power ampliﬁers which have been certiﬁed with a particular transmit- ter  15.203, 15.204 . However, several loopholes are provided in this regulatory fence. First, 15.23 speciﬁcally allows ‘homebuilt’ radios that are produced in small quantities and are not sold. In addition, 15.203 implies noncertiﬁed antennas can be used when systems are ‘professionally installed’, and 15.204 speciﬁcally allows antennas of the same type as the antenna with which the system was certiﬁed, so long as directive gain is equal to or lower than the certiﬁed antenna.  449   Appendix 1  Designers and manufacturers of commercial radio equipment are speciﬁcally permitted to develop and test their hardware but speciﬁcally forbidden to offer it for sale on the open market prior to certiﬁcation. Certiﬁcation is a complex rule-bound process, best relegated to the many testing laboratories that exist to perform this function.  Table A1.1 provides a summary of the sections of part 15 which seem most relevant to unlicensed RFID operation. Some of the regulations are framed in terms of ﬁeld strength. Field strength in dBμV m at 3 m can be converted to EIRP in dBm by subtracting 95.2 dB.  Table A1.1: Summary of Code of Federal Regulations Title 47, Part 15 as of August 2006. Unquoted text is the author’s brief summary; quoted text is taken from the regulations.  Section 15.1  15.5  Topic  Scope  General unlicensed operation  15.19  15.21  15.31  15.33  Labeling requirements Information to user Compliance measurement procedures Measured frequency range  15.35  15.201  Measurement detector functions and bandwidth Certiﬁcation  Summary, excerpts, remarks  This section sets out the conditions under which unlicensed operation is permitted. “Operation of an intentional, unintentional, or incidental radiator is subject to the conditions that no harmful interference is caused and that interference must be accepted that may be caused by the operation of an authorized radio station, by another intentional or unintentional radiator, by industrial, scientiﬁc and medical  ISM  equipment, or by an incidental radiator.” Certiﬁcated devices must be labeled in speciﬁc ways; in particular, the unique FCC ID number must be present. The user’s manual must note that modifying the unit may void the user’s authority to operate without a license. Read ‘em and weep. This is why you pay a testing laboratory.  Frequency range for radiated measurements. Start at the lowest frequency generated by the device, and  for devices operating at < 10 GHz  to the tenth harmonic or 40 GHz, whichever is lower. Thus, for 900 MHz devices the limit will be 9 GHz; 2.45 GHz devices must be checked to 24.5 GHz, and UNII-band  5.2–5.8 GHz  to 40 GHz. Speciﬁes how measurement tools are to be conﬁgured; another section hopefully delegated to your testing laboratory.

In the latter case, the installer is responsible for ensuring that the limits of radiation are not exceeded. Not entirely consistent with 15.204 below.  An antenna can be marketed for use with an intentional radiator if it is of the same type as that used for certiﬁcation testing and of equal or lower gain. A power ampliﬁer can be marketed separately but only for ISM UNII band devices with which it has been tested. Lists bands in which only spurious emissions are allowed. Bands of interest for RFID are: 960–1240 MHz, 2310–2390 MHz, 2483.5–2500 MHz, 4500–5150 MHz, and 5350–5460 MHz. Limits for emission are stated in 15.209. Note there are limits on conducted emissions to the AC power line, and low-frequency  <1 GHz  emissions which are not speciﬁcally cited in this summary, though emissions may exist due e.g. to LO frequencies, must be measured in certiﬁcation.  For f < 900 MHz, ﬁeld strength shall be less than 200 μvolts meter measured at 3 m; for f > 900 MHz, ﬁeld strength shall be less than 500 μvolts meter  except as provided in 15.217 through 15.255 for speciﬁc frequency bands . Note that these ﬁeld strengths correspond to an EIRP of about −49 and −41 dBm, respectively, as per the conversion cited above. Spurs  must be less than the intended fundamental. Measurements should use an averaging detector above 1 GHz. Measurements at distances other than 3 meters are converted using procedures from 15.31, 15.33, and 15.35.  This band is speciﬁcally directed to asset tracking in ports and shipping areas. Band-speciﬁc radiated ﬁeld limits are provided. These devices are forbidden from operating within 40 km of certain air force bases. Users must inform the FCC of the location of the devices and notify the FCC if they are moved.  This one is important and long. Summary presented separately after the table.  The equivalent of 15.247 for the UNII band.

Continued    451   Appendix 1  15.503  UWB band deﬁnitions  15.517  Indoor UWB technical requirements  15.519  15.521  Handheld devices Other UWB uses  15.247 in Detail  fH, fL are the 10-dB-down upper and lower frequencies, fC is avg of fH, fL, fractional BW =  fH−fL  fC, UWB = fractional BW > 0.2 or BW > 500 MHz, Several sections cover requirements for special applications of UWB  e.g. through-wall imaging ; they are not summarized here. Must be only capable of operation indoors; e.g. mains-powered, not intentionally directed outside the building, no outdoor- mounted antennas. UWB bandwidth must be contained between 3,100 and 10,600 MHz; radiated emissions at or below 960 MHz must obey 15.209. There are special restrictions on emission into certain bands. Additionally, in 50 MHz centered on frequency of maximum radiation, less than 0 dBm EIRP. Technical requirements are similar, though these devices may of course be used outdoors. UWB may not be used for toys, on board aircraft, ship, or satellites. The frequency of maximum radiated emission must be within the UWB bandwidth.  Frequency bands covered: 902–928 MHz, 2400–2483.5 MHz, 5725–5850 MHz  “Frequency hopping systems shall have hopping channel carrier frequencies separated by a minimum of 25 kHz or the 20 dB bandwidth of the hopping channel, whichever is greater. . . The system shall hop to channel frequencies that are selected at the system hopping rate from a pseudorandomly ordered list of hopping frequencies. Each frequency must be used equally on the average by each transmitter. The system receivers shall have input bandwidths that match the hopping channel bandwidths of their corresponding transmitters and shall shift frequencies in synchronization with the transmitted signals.”  Frequency-hopping systems in the 902–928 MHz band: at least 50 hopping frequencies if the bandwidth is less than 250 kHz; at least 25 hopping frequencies if the bandwidth is 250–500 kHz. Average time of occupancy at any frequency shall not exceed 0.4 seconds in a 10 second period. Bandwidth > 500 kHz not permitted. Systems using less than 50 hopping channels are limited to 0.25 W conducted power; systems using at least 50 channels may transmit at 1 Watt.  Frequency-hopping systems in the 2400–2483 MHz band: at least 15 nonoverlapping channels must be used. Occupancy in any channel less than 0.4 seconds in a period of  0.4·   of channels  . Systems that use 75 channels are allowed 1 Watt transmit power; any other FH system is limited to 1 8 Watt.  452   Radio Regulations  Digital modulation techniques are allowed in 902–928 MHz, 2400–2483 MHZ and 5725–5850 MHz; 6 dB bandwidth shall be >500 kHz, with 1 Watt maximum transmit power. [Note that there is no longer a ‘spread-spectrum’ requirement, which was present in the original incarnation of the regulations.]  The power limits above assume antennas with no more than 6 dBi of gain. Power must be reduced 1 dB for each dB of antenna gain above 6 dBi  that is, the regulated quantity is actually the EIRP of the system .  All systems must protect the public from harmful RF energy; see Sec. 1.1307 b  1 .  OUT OF BAND: In any 100 kHz slice outside of the target band, the radiated energy must be at least 20 dB less than that found in the 100 kHz slice with the highest intentional power  typically center of the radiated band or near the center . Radiations in the restricted bands deﬁned in 15.205 must be within the limits of 15.209.  COORDINATION: An individual transmitter can adjust hops to avoid interference, but coordination between multiple transmitters is not allowed. [This appears to be a precaution to avoid people simply having a bunch of transmitters all hopping, but the net effect of which is to ﬁll all the band and exceed the limits on radiated power.]  A1.3 European Standards  Individual national regulatory bodies continue to operate within European states, but the nations of the European Union generally seek to harmonize their individual regulatory actions, under the supervision of the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations  CEPT, the acronym being derived from the French . Until 2001, and the European Radiocommunications Committee  ERC  was responsible for spectrum engineering, frequency management, and other technical regulations; in 2001 the ERC was reorganized and renamed the Electronic Communications Committee  ECC . Under the ECC ERC, the European Radiocommunications Ofﬁce  ERO  issues recommendations on spectrum allocation and regulation. The European Telecommunications Standards Institute  ETSI  is responsible for issuing recommended standards for radio protocols, testing, and operation within the EC.  ETSI recommendations must generally be followed by all EC nations. However, each country can and often does choose their own subbands, and each country may create some “interface” standards that can supplement but not contradict the ETSI requirements.  453   Appendix 1  For RFID use in Europe, three documents are of particular interest:    ERC Recommendation 70-03: this document covers spectrum allocation for a  number of low-power applications, including RFID; it also gives some channel- and band-naming conventions that are used in other documents.    ETSI 302 208: regulations for the operation of RFID in the 865–868 MHz bands at  power up to 2 Watts.    ETSI 300 220: overall regulations for short-range radio devices. Some RFID systems have been sold and operated under these requirements, though in general 302 208 is preferred.  At the time of this writing, ETSI documents are available for free download  after registration  from the ETSI web site, www.etsi.org. Brief summaries of some of the key portions of the relevant documents are provided below.  ERC 70-03  The original document is dated 1997; this discussion is based on the October 2005 update. Annex 11 of this document deﬁnes three subbands in the 865–868 MHz range that can be used for RFID. The subbands differ mainly in the radiated power allowed, which is expressed in terms of effective radiated power  ERP , which is like EIRP but referenced to a standard dipole antenna rather than an isotropic antenna. Thus ERP = transmit power  dBm  + antenna gain  dBi  − 2.2 dB; 36 dBm EIRP is about 33.8 dBm ERP.  Subband name  Frequency range  MHz   Allowed power  ERP   b1 b2 b3  865–868  865.6–867.6 865.6–868  0.1 W 2 W 0.5 W  That is, in the region 865–865.6 MHz, transmitters are limited to 100 mW; from 865.6 to 867.6, 2 W ERP are allowed, and from 867.6 to 868 MHz, 500 mW are permitted.  Annex 1 provides differing names for some of the same bands and some additional bandwidth, with much lower power limits and limits on duty cycles and modulation schemes.  454   Radio Regulations  Subband name  MHz   Frequency range  ERP   Allowed power  g g1 g2 g3 g4  863–870 868–868.6 868.7–869.2 869.4–869.65  869.7–870  25 mW 25 mW 25 mW  5 mW  0.5 W, <10% duty cycle  ETSI 302-208 “Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation Equipment operating in the band 865–868 MHz with power levels up to 2 W”  version 1.1.2, 7 06   ETSI 302 208 is speciﬁcally directed to RFID applications using the 865–868 MHz band and the b1 b2 b3 nomenclature. Interrogators must employ 200 kHz channels, with stringent spectral mask requirements. This means that maximum reader data rates will be roughly 40% of those obtained in the United States.  Reader must use Listen Before Talk  LBT . This means that before a reader can transmit on a given channel, it must listen to the channel to ensure that no other transmitter is using it. The sensitivity required is determined by the amount of power to be transmitted: a 2 Watt ERP reader must have a sensitivity of −96 dBm.  This is a very stringent requirement indeed; a one-watt transmitter with an unobstructed line of sight to the receiver would produce this signal level from a distance of 200 km, assuming both units are equipped with 6 dBi antennas. In practice it has been found that with such restrictions, large numbers of collocated readers operating without central coordination are simply impractical. For example, subband b2 has only 10 high-power channels, so if there are 40–50 readers at a facility  one for each loading bay  running at reasonably high duty cycles, all channels will be occupied all the time!  Revised regulations have been proposed to deal with this conundrum  TR 102 v 1.1.1, September 2006 . In the new scheme, an approach generally similar to the Generation 2 Dense Interrogator Mode will be used, with readers operating  say  even-numbered channels and tag signals centered in  say  odd-numbered channels. In this case central coordination of the readers is assumed and LBT is abandoned or constrained.  ETSI 300-220 “Radio equipment to be used in the 25 MHz to 1000 MHz frequency range with power levels ranging up to 500 mW”  version 2.1.1, 4 05   EN 300-220 is not RFID-speciﬁc but creates some general categories for operating short- range, low-power devices in the same general bands addressed by 302 208. The bands  455   Appendix 1  addressed are the g-g4 bands described in ERC 70-03. Power is strictly limited, and duty cycle  the percent of time the transmitter can be on  is limited unless the transmitter implements LBT, except for band g4, where only very low power operation is allowed.  In the past, some handheld readers have been able to operate in band g3 under 300-220, since it can be expected that a handheld reader will not be on most of the time, and RFID printers have been allowed in band g4: since the tags are on a roll passing right over the reader antenna, actual power radiated from the printer is very small. It is expected that as countries adopt 302 208, RFID operation will be required to meet 302-208 requirements and 300-220 will no longer be allowed, although the anticipated revisions of 302-208 may delay adoption.  A1.4 Those Other Few Billion Folks  The rest of the world is hardly less important than the United States or Europe, but is rather more fragmented and opaque from a regulatory point of view. The situation was graphically summarized in Figure 2.13 in Chapter 2. From time to time EPCglobal publishes a very useful summary of regulatory status worldwide; the latest at the time of this writing is ‘Regulatory status for using RFID in the UHF spectrum, 3 March 2006’. Generally speaking most nations of the world follow either the FCC or ETSI approach, or some combination of the two. However, in most countries providing FCC-like operation, only a small subset of the 26 MHz available in the United States is provided. This is in part due to the prevalence of the GSM cellular telephony standard in many regions of the world, which uses some of the bandwidth allocated to the ISM band in the US.  A few words on some of the key nations seem appropriate:  In Japan, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications regulates the use of the radio spectrum. The MBT appears to delegate the creation of ‘voluntary’ Japanese standards to the Association of Radio Industries and Businesses  ARIB . Equipment certiﬁcation is performed by the Telecom Engineering Center  TELEC .  The Ministry of Information Industry regulates radio operations in the People’s Republic of China  the mainland . The regulations do not appear to be readily available in English.  Radio operation in Singapore is regulated by the Infocomm Development Authority  IDA . Regulations are generally available in English. RFID operation is allowed in the 866–869 MHz band without a license, and in the 923–925 MHz band at less than 0.5 W ERP. At power levels from 0.5 to 2 W ERP, a site license is required.

The two closely related functions sine and cosine, abbreviated sin x  and cos x , where the arguments of the functions are here expressed as radians. The argument can also be expressed in degrees. There are 2π radians in a circle, so one radian =  180 π  ≈ 57 degrees. Both functions are periodic with a period of 2π radians, so if we write the sine as sin 2πf t , where t is time, then f = 1 period = frequency. We often use the angular frequency ω = 2πf,  Figure A2.1: Sines and Cosines as a Function of Time.  459   Appendix 2  in which case the sine becomes sin ωt . Frequency is measured in Hertz  abbreviated Hz ; 1 Hz is one full cycle of the function per second. Thus when the frequency is 900 MHz = 900 000 000 Hz, the angular frequency is about 5.65 billion radians per second. Both of these functions alternate between a maximum value of 1 and minimum value of −1; cosine starts at +1, and sine starts at 0, when the argument is zero. We can see that cosines and sines are identical except for an offset in the argument  the phase  :   cid:14    cid:15   ωt + π 2 ◦ We say that the sine lags the cosine by π 2 radians or 90 .  cos ωt  =sin   A2.1   A2.2 Complex Numbers and Complex Exponentials  Let us now digress brieﬂy to discuss complex numbers, for reasons that will become clear in a page or two. Imaginary numbers, the reader will recall, are introduced to provide square  −1 . A complex number is the sum of a real number roots of negative reals; the unit is i =   cid:16   Figure A2.2: A Complex Number Depicted as a Point in the Plane.  460   Harmonic Functions  and an imaginary number, often written as e.g. z = a + bi, where bi indicates the product of the real number b and the imaginary unit i. Electrical engineers often use j instead of i, so as to use i to represent an AC current; we shall use that convention here. The complex conjugate z* is found by changing the sign of the imaginary part: z∗ = a− bj. This is a useful operation, since the quantity z + z∗  is then a real number.  Complex numbers can be depicted in a plane by using the real part as the coordinate on the x-  real  axis, and the imaginary part for the y-  imaginary  axis  Figure A2.2 .  Operations on complex numbers proceed more or less the same way as they do in algebra, save that one must remember to keep track of the real and imaginary parts. Thus, the sum of two complex numbers can be constructed algebraically by   a + bj  +  c + d j  = [a + c] + [b + d]j   A2.2   and geometrically by regarding the two numbers as vectors forming two sides of a parallel- ogram, the diagonal of which is their sum  Figure A2.3 .  Figure A2.3: Addition of Complex Numbers.  461   Appendix 2  Multiplication can be treated in a similar fashion, but it is much simpler to envision if we ﬁrst deﬁne the length  also known as the modulus  and angle of a complex number. We deﬁne a complex number of length 1 and angle θ to be equal to an exponential with an imaginary argument equal to the angle  Figure A2.4 . Recall the number e is about 2.718, and is the base for the natural logarithm. Any complex number  for example, b in the ﬁgure  can then be represented as the product of the modulus and an imaginary exponential whose argument is equal to the angle of the complex number in radians.  By writing a complex number as an exponential, multiplication of complex numbers becomes simple, once we recall that the product of two exponentials is an exponential with the sum of the arguments:  ea · eb = e[a+b].   A2.3   The product of two complex numbers is then constructed by multiplying their moduli, and adding their angles  Figure A2.5 ,  Figure A2.4: Complex Numbers Written Using Imaginary Exponential Functions.  462   Harmonic Functions   A2.4    A2.5    ρ1ejθ1 ·  ρ2ejθ2  = [ρ1ρ2]ej[θ1+θ2].  The imaginary unit j is an exponential with an argument of π 2, so 1 j is an exponential with  an argument of −π 2—that is:  cid:12    cid:13 · cid:12   ej π  2  e−j π  2   cid:13   = 1 → 1 j  = −j.  We have taken the trouble to introduce all these unreal quantities because they provide a particularly convenient way to represent harmonic signals. Since the x- and y-components of a unit vector at angle θ are just the cosine and sine, respectively, of the angle, our deﬁnition of an exponential with imaginary argument implies:  ejθ = cos θ  + j sin θ .   A2.6   Thus, if we use for the angle a linear function of time, we obtain a very general but simultaneously compact expression for a harmonic signal: ej ωt+φ  = cos ωt + φ  +j sin ωt + φ   = [cos ωt  + j sin ωt ]· [cos φ  +j sin φ ] .   A2.7   Figure A2.5: Multiplying Complex Numbers by Multiplying Lengths and Adding Angles.  463   Appendix 2  In this notation, the signal may be imagined as a vector of constant length rotating in time, with its projections on the real and imaginary axes forming the familiar sines and cosines  Figure A2.6 . The phase offset φ represents the angle of the vector at t = 0.  In some cases we wish to use an exponential as an intermediate calculation tool to simplify phase shifts and other operations, converting to a real-valued function at the end by either simply taking only the real part, or adding together exponentials of positive and negative frequency.  The reader may wish to verify, using equation  A2.6  and  A2.7 , that the sum of exponentials of positive and negative frequencies forms a purely real or purely imaginary sinusoid.  However, in radio practice, a real harmonic signal cos ωt + φ  may also be regarded as being the product of a real carrier cos ωt  and a complex number I + jQ = [cos φ − j sin φ ] 2, where the imaginary part is obtained through multiplication with sin ωt  followed ◦ by ﬁltering.  Here I and Q denote ‘in-phase’ and ‘quadrature’—that is, 90 respectively.  This formal decomposition is carried out in practice using two mixers excited by local oscillator signals in quadrature; see Chapter 4 for examples of this conﬁguration.  out of phase—  Figure A2.6: An Imaginary Exponential can Represent Sinusoidal Voltages or Currents.  464   Harmonic Functions  We can use the multiplicative properties of exponentials  equation  A2.3   to derive some very useful identities relating trigonometric functions:  eiθeiφ = ei θ+φ  →  cos θ  + isin θ   cos φ  +i sin φ    =  cos θ + φ  +i sin θ + φ    equating real and imaginary parts:  cos θ cos φ − sin θ sin φ  =cos  θ + φ  sin θ cos φ  +cos  θ sin φ  =sin θ + φ .  So we can express cosines and sines of a sum or difference as products of cosines and sines of the individual values. We can readily derive expressions for products of cosines and sines, and double- and triple-angle relationships.  Finally, we note one other uniquely convenient feature of exponentials: differentiation and integration of an exponential with a linear argument simply multiplies or divides the original function by the constant slope of the argument:   cid:2   d dx   eax  =ae ax;  eaxdx = eax a  .  That is, exponentials convert calculus to algebra! Electrical engineering makes extensive use of this remarkable fact in analyzing networks containing capacitors and inductors, as we discuss in Appendix 3.   A2.8    A2.9   465   This page intentionally left blank   Resistance, Impedance and Switching  APPENDIX 3  A3.1 Electric Company Detective Sherlock Ohms  Electric current is the ﬂow of electrically charged particles along a wire.  The particles that ﬂow are usually electrons, which by convention have a negative charge as a consequence of Benjamin Franklin guessing wrong; therefore the direction of current ﬂow is usually oppo- site the direction in which the particles actually move. Sorry.  A resistor is a device that doesn’t store electrical charges, but merely resists their ﬂow. Electrical engineering starts with Ohm’s law: the voltage across a resistor is proportional to the current ﬂowing through it. In mathematical terms:  V = I · R   A3.1   where I is the current, R the resistance, and V the voltage. Electrical current is usually carried in thin wires, and generally returns to where it started to form a circuit. We can draw a simpliﬁed picture of an electrical circuit, using line segments for wires, a circle to symbolize a voltage source  like a battery or generator , and a squiggly line to indicate a resistor. This is known as a schematic diagram, or just schematic for short. The schematic for a simple circuit containing only a resistor and a voltage source is shown in Figure A3.1. The ﬁgure also shows a ground symbol. Ground is just the location in the circuit where the voltage is deﬁned to be equal to 0. The voltage along a wire is constant, so the voltage on all the wires directly connected to ground is 0. The voltage source creates a voltage difference V1 between the top and bottom connections. The wire carries this voltage to the left side of the resistor. The right side of the resistor is connected by a wire to ground and so is at zero voltage. By Ohm’s law, the current that ﬂows through the resistor is the ratio of voltage to resistance:   A3.2   The current is constant all around the circuit, because there’s nowhere else for it to go  assuming the electrons are all stuck on the wire : this statement can be formalized as one of Kirchoff’s laws.  I = V1 R  .  467   Appendix 3  Figure A3.1: Example Schematic Diagram.  When the same current ﬂows through two resistors in sequence, the resistors are said to be connected in series. Resistors can also be connected in parallel, providing multiple paths for the current to ﬂow in. These alternatives are illustrated in Figure A3.2. When the resistors are connected in series, the voltage at the top of resistor R1 is found from Ohm’s law as IR1. This is also the voltage at the right side of resistor R2. Since the voltage across R2—the difference between the voltages at the left and right—is similarly IR2, the total voltage across the two resistors is the sum of the individual voltages. That is, the two resistors in series act just like a single resistor whose value is the sum of the two individual resistors:  where Rser ≡ R1 + R2.  V1 = IR1 + IR2 = I R1 + R2  =IR ser   A3.3   When resistors are connected in parallel, the total current splits between the two branches. We can again ﬁnd a single resistance equivalent to the two resistors, but the calculation is a bit  468   Resistance, Impedance and Switching  Figure A3.2: a  Two Resistors Connected in Series; b  Two Resistors Connected in Parallel.  more complex. We can ﬁnd the current through each resistor individually using Ohm’s law since the voltages on the left and right sides of the two resistors are the same:  We then impose the condition that the two resistor currents sum to the total current:  I1 = V1 R1  ;  I1 + I2 = I = V1 R1 I = V1 Rpar  + V1 R2 where Rpar ≡  .  I2 = V1 R2  cid:2   = V1  1 + 1 R2  1 R1   cid:3   1 R1  + 1 R2  −→  = R1R2 R1 + R2   A3.4    A3.5   That is, the two resistor in parallel look like a single resistor whose value is a somewhat messy formula. If the two resistors are of equal value, the parallel resistance is 1 2 of the resistance of either one. If one resistor is much smaller than the other, the parallel resistance is nearly equal to that of the smaller-valued resistor and the other has little effect.  Sometimes people like to introduce the conductance G = 1 R. The conductance is the ratio of current to voltage. The conductance of resistors in parallel simply adds together:  Gpar = 1 R1  + 1 R2  = G1 + G2.   A3.6   469   Appendix 3  Any circuit can be decomposed into series and parallel combinations of components. Thus, any combination of resistors can be converted into a single effective resistor value, though the computation may be laborious for a complex circuit.  A3.2 Resistance is Useless?  No—just insufﬁcient.  A resistor is a passive component: it does not add power to a circuit but merely converts a current into a voltage. Two other very common passive components are capacitors and inductors.  A capacitor is a device that stores charge. It is constructed by placing two conductive plates very close to one another  Figure A3.3 . Since like charges repel, if some negative charge accumulates on one plate, electrons are driven away from the other plate, producing a net positive charge. The charge is proportional to the voltage between the plates; the constant of proportionality is the capacitance C. That is:  Q = C · V   A3.7   where Q is the charge on the capacitor. It would be nice to use an analog of Ohm’s law to analyze circuits with capacitors and resistors, but there is a problem: the voltage is expressed  Figure A3.3: Simpliﬁed Physical Capacitor and Schematic Representation. Note that Although the Schematic Symbol is Often Asymmetric, In Fact Most Capacitors Can Have Either Polarity Applied to Either Plate.  470   not in terms of a current but of a charge. Since current is the ﬂow of electric charge, the total charge is the time integral of the current:  Resistance, Impedance and Switching   cid:2   Q =  Idt.   cid:2   Idt = C · V.   A3.8    A3.9   So instead of a simple linear relationship between current and voltage, analysis of a capacitor leads to an integral equation:  It is possible to treat circuits by writing out and solving the appropriate integral equation, but fortunately there’s a way to make the process look a lot more like the analysis we used for resistors. The trick is to assume that all the circuit currents and voltages are the real part of a complex harmonic function  these were introduced in Appendix 2 —that is:  V  t  =V 0ejωt  I t  =I 0e jωt.   A3.10   The coefﬁcients V0 and I0 are complex numbers but are not time-dependent. The reason this is useful is that the time integral of the current is obtained by dividing the current by a constant. Equation  A3.9  becomes:  I0ejωt jω  = CV0ejωt −→ V0 = 1  I0 = −jXcI0.  jωC   A3.11   That is, if we use  complex  amplitudes, we can once again express the voltage as the product of the current and a quantity analogous to the resistance, the capacitive reactance Xc. The voltage is imaginary if the current is real: physically, this means that the voltage across a ◦ capacitor is not in phase with the current, but lags the current by 90 of the fact that it takes a while to build up charge on the capacitor: at the moment when current is maximum, the charge accumulated in the previous cycle has gone to 0, and by the time the charge is ﬁnished accumulating  corresponding to a maximum value of voltage  the current has returned to 0. The capacitive reactance is inversely proportional to the capacitance: large capacitors offer little impediment to the ﬂow of  AC  current, whereas small capacitors require large voltages for signiﬁcant current ﬂow.  . This is the direct result  Armed with reactances, we can analyze circuits containing resistors and capacitors in more or less the same way we analyzed resistive circuits. However, in this case, the constant of proportionality between overall current and voltage will be a complex number, the impedance, usually written as Z. For example, the impedance of a series combination of a resistor and a capacitor is the sum of the reactance and resistance: R + 1 jωC  = I0 · Z  V0 = I0   A3.12    cid:2    cid:3   471   Appendix 3  Figure A3.4: Series Circuit Containing a Resistor and Capacitor, Analyzed Using Complex Impedance.  as illustrated in Figure A3.4. The impedance plays exactly the role of the resistance in Ohm’s law, but it is a complex number, and its value is dependent on the frequency of the currents and voltages.  The other important passive component is the inductor  Figure A3.5 . An inductor is a length of wire arranged so that the magnetic interaction of the currents ﬂowing on the wire is signiﬁcant. This magnetic interaction can be regarded as an extra contribution to the momentum of the electrons in the wire: current in the inductor doesn’t like to get started and once it does get started it doesn’t like to stop. These propensities can be summarized mathematically by saying that the voltage across an inductor is proportional to the rate of change of the current, that is to the time derivative of the current:  where the constant of proportionality is the inductance L. By assuming once again that the voltages and currents have a harmonic dependence, we obtain an expression for the inductive reactance:  jωLI0ejωt = V0ejωt −→ V0 = jωLI0 = jXLI0.   A3.14    A3.13   V = LdI dt  472   Resistance, Impedance and Switching  Figure A3.5: Simpliﬁed Physical Inductor and Schematic Representation.  The inductive reactance is also complex but of the opposite sign to that of a capacitor: the ◦ . The reactance of an inductor increases with voltage on an inductor leads the current by 90 increasing frequency and larger values of inductance. Inductors are the electrical opposite of capacitors. The impedance of a series resistor—inductor circuit is  Figure A3.6 :  V0 = I0 R + jωL  =I 0 · Z.   A3.15   It is informative now to combine all the elements we have studied by ﬁnding the impedance of a series combination of a resistor, capacitor, and inductor.  In this and subsequent expressions, we omit the 0 sufﬁx, assuming that all the voltages and currents are time-independent complex amplitudes.  Adding the reactances we obtain:   cid:2   ZLCR =  R + jωL− j ωC   cid:3   .  The interesting property of this expression is that the capacitance and inductance contribute with opposite signs, so for any given values of L and C, there is some frequency where the reactances exactly cancel, and the circuit just looks like a resistor as far as the overall voltage and current are concerned. This condition is known as a series resonance. The resonant frequency occurs when the two reactances are equal in magnitude:   cid:7   ωresL = 1 ωresC  −→ ωres =  ·  1 LC   A3.16    A3.17   If the resistance is small compared to the magnitude of the inductive and capacitive reactances, the current ﬂowing through the circuit will be much larger at resonance than at frequencies  473   Appendix 3  Figure A3.6: Series Circuit Containing a Resistor and Inductor, Analyzed Using Complex Impedance.  where the two reactive elements no longer cancel. The ratio of the reactance to the resistance of the circuit is known as the quality factor, Q.  Q = ωresL R  = 1  ωresCR   A3.18   The bandwidth of the circuit at resonance is inversely proportional to the quality factor.  Parallel circuits of resistors, capacitors, and inductors can also be analyzed in the same fash- ion, but the resulting expressions are more difﬁcult to work with because of the presence of complex denominators. A parallel combination of an inductor and a capacitor also exhibits resonant behavior, but instead of the current reaching a maximum at resonance, it is minimized.  474   Resistance, Impedance and Switching  A3.3 Switching  Active components can amplify signals and make new ones. The common active components are transistors, of which the most popular type today is the ﬁeld-effect transistor  FET , which depends on the electric ﬁeld of a gate electrode to attract charge carriers into the channel, turning the device on and allowing current to ﬂow between the source and drain. When constructed on silicon, FETs are typically fabricated using a thin layer of silicon dioxide to separate the gate and the channel and can either use electrons  NMOS  or holes  PMOS  as charge carriers. To operate an NMOS device, a positive voltage is applied to the drain; a positive voltage on the gate will allow electrons to ﬂow from source to drain  with conventional current ﬂowing in the other direction . A PMOS device uses opposite polarities on all the contacts and is thus turned on by a negative voltage applied to the gate, with conventional current ﬂow in agreement with the ﬂow of holes from source to drain. These conventions are illustrated in Figure A3.7. A FET can be used as a diode by connecting the gate and drain together. For example, an NMOS device connected in this fashion will conduct current readily when a positive voltage is applied to the drain  and gate , since the gate is positive with respect to the source but will turn off when a negative voltage is applied to the common drain gate contact.  Figure A3.7: NMOS and PMOS Transistors.  475   This page intentionally left blank   APPENDIX 4  Reﬂection and Matching  A4.1 Reﬂection Coefﬁcients  In most of our discussion, we have assumed that radios, tags, and antennas are all well- matched, so that any power coming from one goes into the other. What happens when this is not the case? How do we measure the deviation from ideality, and what can we do about it? In this appendix we provide a very brief introduction into reﬂection coefﬁcients and impedance matching.  In Microwave Land, a port is a connection from one microwave environment to another—for example, from a cable to an antenna. The cable, or any other signal-carrying electrical con- nection whose properties are well-deﬁned and don’t change along its length, is often known as a transmission line. A signal traveling along a transmission line ideally doesn’t change its shape as it moves down the line, but only its phase. Transmission lines generally have a characteristic impedance, the ratio of the voltage due to a current traveling along the line to the current, that is a real resistance: 50-Ω transmission lines are very commonly encountered in microwave applications. The signal traveling along the transmission line to an antenna or other component may be partially reﬂected if the impedances of the antenna and the line do not match  Figure A4.1 .  The ratio of the reﬂected signal to the incident signal is the reﬂection coefﬁcient:  The reﬂection coefﬁcient is in general complex, since the phase of the incident and reﬂected waves may not be the same. It can be shown that the reﬂection coefﬁcient is related to the impedance seen by a wave at port 1:   A4.1    A4.2   where Zl is the  generally complex  impedance of the port and Zc is the characteristic imped- ance of the transmission line, typically 50 Ω. Recall that the impedance of a capacitor C  Γ ≡ νref νinc  .  Γ = Z1 − Zc Z1 + Zc  477   Appendix 4  Figure A4.1: An Incident and Reﬂected Signal.  with frequency f is ZC = 1  jωC , and an inductor has an impedance of ZL = jωL, with ω = 2πf.  The reﬂection coefﬁcient must always have a magnitude less than 1  if port 1 has only passive circuits inside of it  and varies from +1 for an open  inﬁnite load impedance  to −1 for a short  zero load impedance , as can be easily veriﬁed from  A4.2 . The magnitude of the reﬂection coefﬁcient in dB is often known as the return loss; the terminology implies that this is the loss suffered by the incident signal making a return trip to the sending instrument.  The phase of the reﬂection coefﬁcient changes if we measure it at a different location along the cable, because the incident wave gains phase as we move to the right, and the reﬂected wave gains phase as we move to the left. Since the ratio of the voltages takes the difference of the phases  see Appendix 2 , the phase of Γ changes by 4π each time the measurement plane moves one wavelength. Since the total voltage at any location is the sum of the incident and reﬂected voltages, the total voltage will also vary with position along the cable. The ratio between the largest and smallest magnitude of voltage is known as the voltage standing wave ratio, often abbreviated VSWR.  The importance of this somewhat funky parameter is partially historical; in the days when phases of microwaves were very difﬁcult to measure it was relatively easy to move a pickup along a waveguide and measure the difference in power received.  By reference to equation  A4.2  it is easy to see that VSWR can be expressed in terms of the reﬂection coefﬁcient:   A4.3   If we display the reﬂection coefﬁcient corresponding to a particular complex impedance in the complex plane, with scales showing the corresponding impedance, we get an extremely useful  VSWR = 1 +Γ 1−Γ.  478   graphical tool for matching and other microwave circuit operations, the Smith Chart.  Such an operation is formally known as a conformal map; circles map to circles and angles are preserved.  A simpliﬁed chart is shown in Figure A4.2.  Reﬂection and Matching  Figure A4.2: The Smith Chart.  The Smith chart maps the inﬁnite impedance right half-plane  with positive values of the resistance  into a ﬁnite region  a circle of radius 1 . It provides a very useful visual summary of what adding any element to the circuit of port 1 does to the consequent reﬂection. Moving along the transmission line towards the load moves the reﬂection coefﬁcient counterclockwise on a circle around the point Γ = 0  as shown in Figure A4.2 ; for each half-wavelength distance, the impedance makes a complete circle around the chart. Adding a capacitance or inductance moves the reﬂection coefﬁcient on a circle of constant resistance; adding a  series  resistor moves Γ on an arc of constant reactance. Another nifty property of the Smith chart is that the picture for admittances  the reciprocal of an impedance, corresponding to elements added in parallel instead of in series  is just the same chart but reﬂected through the y-axis  Figure A4.3 .  When used for design purposes, the Smith chart is usually displayed with a large number of circles of constant resistance and arcs of constant reactance, each labeled with either the corresponding value in ohms, or the normalized value  that is, the resistance or reactance  479   Appendix 4  Figure A4.3: The Smith Chart for Admittance is the Mirror Image of the Smith Chart for Impedance.  divided by the characteristic impedance of the transmission line, Zc . An example of this type of practical design chart is shown in Figure A4.4.  A4.2 A Simple  But Relevant  Matching Example  Let us consider the problem of matching a short dipole antenna to a tag IC: that is, adjusting the impedance of the IC so that all the power that the antenna delivers is absorbed by the IC. Two conditions must be met to ensure best power transfer:  1. The real part of the load impedance must be equal to the real part of the source  impedance.  2. The imaginary part of the load impedance must be— imaginary part of the source  impedance : that is, the load impedance is the complex conjugate of the source impedance, so that when we add them together to get the total the imaginary parts cancel, leaving only the resistances.  Plausible values for the equivalent circuits for these two objects are shown in Figure A4.5. Here, the antenna is represented by the resistor, capacitor, and inductor in series; the  480   Reﬂection and Matching  Figure A4.4: Practical Design Smith Chart, Normalized to the Characteristic Impedance of the Line.  component values have been adjusted to be reasonably representative of a dipole antenna a bit shorter than resonance. The load is a lossy capacitance like an IC input, though the values have been adjusted to make the load a bit easier to see. The challenge is to ﬁnd a way to convert the actual load impedance, a lossy capacitance at the bottom right part of the chart, to the matched load impedance, a rather more lossy inductance at the top right.  One possible ﬁrst step is to use a large series inductor to both resonate the IC capacitance and that of the antenna. However, this requires a rather large inductor and will not solve the  481   Appendix 4  Figure A4.5: Example Matching Problem. a  Equivalent Circuit Model for Antenna and IC b  Corresponding Loads on the Smith Chart. Component Values Adapted for Visibility.  problem of the mismatch between the 50-Ω source and 15-Ω load. A better approach is to use a smaller series inductor to move the load along a circle of constant resistance, towards the real axis  Figure A4.6 .  Figure A4.6: a  A Series Inductor is Placed Before the Load b  The Series Reactance Moves the Load on a Circle of Constant Resistance Towards the Real Axis.  482   Reﬂection and Matching  Figure A4.7: a  A Shunt Inductor is Placed Across the Load to Complete the Match b  The Shunt Susceptance Moves the Load on a Circle of Constant Conductance. Note that a Simpliﬁed Admittance Chart has been Overlaid on the Impedance Smith Chart.  The value of the series inductor is chosen to allow the match to be completed by a shunt inductor  Figure A4.7 . The inductance of a straight line is about:   cid:2    cid:2    cid:3   4L w   cid:3   − 1  ,   cid:9  nH  =2L  ln   A4.4   so a 21 nH inductor fabricated in 1 mm wide line is about 2.5 cm long, a convenient size.  The shunt inductor can move the load along a circle of constant conductance. By choosing the proper value for the series inductance, we can arrange for this circle to intersect the desired conjugately matched load. The 21 nH and 6 nH inductors are more readily realized with short strips of line than the 42 nH inductor that would be needed to match using a single element. More importantly, the use of two matching elements allows us to transform the real part of the load to match the real part of the source. A single inductor would resonate out the series capacitances but leave us with a load resistance of 15 Ω, implying poor power transfer from the antenna—most of the power is scattered away. The use of the series-shunt inductors allows us to make the load appear like a 50 Ω resistor to the source, achieving optimal power transfer.  The series-shunt matching procedure shown here is particularly convenient for tag antennas, since the requisite inductors are realized as short lengths of feed line connecting the integrated circuit to the antenna. Many other matching topologies are possible, employing series and shunt capacitances and lengths of transmission line.  483   This page intentionally left blank   Index  fan beam, patch antenna  for,

This book includes a survey of all RFID fundamentals and practices in the first part of the book while the second part focuses on UHF passive technology. This coverage of UHF technology and its components including tags, readers, and antennas is essential to commercial implementation in supply chain logistics and security. Reaaders of this book should have an electrical engineering background but have not yet dealt with RFID. To this end, Dr. Dobkin will be very careful to illustrate all concepts and detail his explanations meticulously. In this way he will bring the reader along organically showing him/her what to expect, develop, and use while implementing an RFID system.
