[	viii	]   Preface  Most online interactive content uses 2D graphics. To represent real-life situations, Rich  Internet Applications  RIAs  need to show real-time 3D scenes. This book will let you add  a new dimension to your Silverlight applications using C and XAML. The book covers the  various tools and libraries needed for giving life to 3D models in a Silverlight viewport—right  from editing, exporting, loading, and controlling 3D models up to specific 3D algorithms.  It will help you learn to develop 3D games and interactive 3D scenes for a web site with  animated models, with numerous examples and clear explanations packed with screenshots  to aid your understanding of every process. After all of the code is written and the additional  art assets edited, they are all compressed into .zip files for easy availability and use.   What this book covers  Chapter 1: Lights, Camera, and Action!: In this chapter, we will cover many topics that will  help us to understand the new tools and techniques involved in preparing 2D graphics to be  used in Silverlight games. This chapter is all about tools and graphics.  Chapter 2: Working with 2D Characters: In this chapter, we will begin creating 2D characters  that move on the screen and we will learn to control their behavior in the 2D space. We will  learn about GPU hardware acceleration, 2D vectors, resolutions, sprites, and animation.  Chapter 3: Combining Sprites with Backgrounds: In this chapter, we will control multiple sprites  created on demand. We will animate several independent sprites at the same time, while  responding to the keys pressed by the player to control characters and some game logic.  Chapter 4: Working with 3D Characters: In this chapter, we will take 3D elements from  popular and professional 3D DCC tools and we will show them rendered in real-time on the  screen. We will learn a lot about 3D models, meshes, and 3D engines.  Chapter 5: Controlling the Cameras: Giving Life to Lights and Actions: In this chapter, we  will learn everything we need to know about 3D cameras to be able to render our models  in real-time on a 2D screen from different angles. We will change the values for their most  important properties and we will be able to watch their effects in a rendered 3D view.   Preface  Chapter 6: Controlling Input Devices to Provide Great Feedback: In this chapter, we will learn  everything we need to know about the most widely used gaming input devices. We will be  able to read values from them in order to control many aspects of our games.  Chapter 7: Using Effects and Textures to Amaze: In this chapter, we will learn everything we  need to know about the process of enveloping a 3D model using textures. We will be able  to take 3D elements from popular and professional 3D DCC tools and we will show them  rendered in real-time on the screen with different textures and enlightened by many lights.  Chapter 8: Animating 3D Characters: In this chapter, we will learn how to move, rotate, and  scale the 3D models in the 3D scenes. We will use object-oriented capabilities to define  independent behaviors for simple and complex 3D characters.  Chapter 9: Adding Realistic Motions Using a Physics Engine: In this chapter, we will   simulate some laws of 2D and 3D physics. We will learn to define gravity force, mass, drag  coefficients, and moment of inertia to represent the physical properties of the bodies that  define a model.  Chapter 10: Applying Artificial Intelligence: In this chapter, we will detect collisions between  3D characters and we will define specific behaviors using artificial intelligence, persecution,  and evasion algorithms  Chapter 11: Applying Special Effects: In this chapter, we will use advanced physics and special  effects.

It is an incredible  opportunity and you cannot miss this train. Tickets, please!   Lights, Camera, and Action!  Developing 3D games is an exciting process, but it is also difficult. However, working with   a 2D game before moving into the 3D world is a nice starting point. That is exactly what we  are going to do.  During our journey, we will need to exploit our creativity as much as possible. Game  development requires many heterogeneous skills. However, the most important   ingredient is creativity.  We already know how to develop some applications using the C programming language.  However, RIAs  Rich Internet Applications  offer an exciting way ahead for game  development because they provide a rich experience for users without the need to install  software on their computers. Users expect RIAs to be like conventional downloadable games  that offer amazing graphics, impressive performance, and a very interactive experience.  Silverlight is a great  and growing  RIA platform, and games are the next level to exploit in  Silverlight. 3D games represent our challenge in this book and we shall take full advantage   of our C knowledge here.  So, let's take our C, XAML, and Silverlight development skills to the next level. We want to  take full advantage of modern technologies. First of all, we must install the latest tools and  begin working on some 2D games' basics. Later, we will use that knowledge in developing 3D  games using Silverlight 3, the newest kid on the block from Microsoft.  The only requirements needed to develop 3D games using Silverlight are to understand the  basics of the C programming language, XAML code, and the Visual Studio IDE. We will cover  the rest of the requirements in our journey through the 3D game development world!  Time for action – preparing the development environment First, we must download and install various Silverlight development tools.  We need to install Visual C 2008  .NET Framework 3.5  with Service Pack 1 or greater   Visual C 2010  in order to successfully complete the installations provided here. Installing  Silverlight 3 Tools will uninstall the previous Silverlight versions. We will not be able to create  Silverlight 2 applications using Visual C 2008 with Silverlight 3 Tools installed in our system.  Visual C 2010 does not have this restriction because it allows us to choose the desired  Silverlight version target.  You can use the free Visual Web Developer 2008 Express Edition or greater   http:  www.microsoft.com express vwd  . However, you  have to read the documentation and consider its limitations carefully.  [  ]   Chapter 1  It is a commercial tool,  but the trial offers a  free fully functional  version for 30 days.  This tool will enable  us to transform  vector assets to the  appropriate format for  use in Silverlight 3. It is a very complete  free, open source,  vector drawing  program. This tool  will enable us to  import many vector  assets in different,  popular file formats  and export them to a  format recognized by  Expression Design. We must install it  to create Silverlight  3 applications in  Visual Studio IDE  using XAML and C.  This will uninstall  previous Silverlight  SDKs  Software  Development Kits . We must download  and decompress this  file, as we will be  needing access to the  Silverlight 3 official  documentation.  The following are steps for preparing the development environment:  1.	 Download the following files:  Application  name Expression  Design  Download link  File name  Description  http:  www.microsoft. com expression  products Overview. aspx?key=design  Design_Trial_ en.exe  Inkscape  http:  inkscape.org  download ?lang=en  Inkscape- 0.46.win32. exe  Silverlight  3 Tools for  Visual Studio  http:  www.microsoft. com downloads details. aspx?familyid=9442b0f2- 7465-417a-88f3-5e7b5409 e9dd&displaylang=en  Silverlight3_ Tools.exe  Silverlight  3 Offline  Documentation   in a CHM  format   http:  www.microsoft. com downloads details. aspx?familyid=0A9773A7- C854-41FA-B73D-535ABFB7 3BAF&displaylang=en  Silverlight_ 3_Docs.zip  [  ]   Lights, Camera, and Action!

It  will be really helpful  to use Expression  Blend 3 to create rapid  prototypes for some  game scenes. This framework  allows the creation of  business applications  that are capable of  talking to our games.  In the same link, there  is a PDF file available  for download  with interesting  documentation about  this framework. It is convenient to  download the latest  stable release. This  toolkit provides a  nice collection of  Silverlight controls,  components, and  utilities made  available outside the  normal Silverlight  release cycle. It will  be really helpful to  use these controls to  provide many game  statistics. Besides,  it includes more  Silverlight themes.  2.  Run the installers in the same order in which they appear in the previous   list, and follow the steps to complete the installation wizards. Take into  account that to install Silverlight 3 Tools for Visual Studio, you will need an  Internet connection for a small download when the wizard begins. One of  the items enumerated under the Products affected by the software update:  list is Download Preparation, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 10 ]   Chapter 1  3.	 Once the installations have successfully finished, run Visual Studio 2008 or Visual   Web Developer 2008  or later . You will see the Microsoft Silverlight Projects  label displayed on the splash screen, as shown in the following picture:  [ 11 ]   Lights, Camera, and Action!  4.	  If the splash screen disappears too quickly, you will not be able to check Silverlight's  availability. However, you can check it once Visual Studio 2008 or Visual Web  Developer 2008  or later  is running. Select Help  About Microsoft Visual Studio. A  dialog box will appear and you will see Microsoft Silverlight Projects 2008 displayed  under the Installed products list. Select this item and check whether Product  details shows number 3 after the second dot  . . For example, 9.0.30730.126  indicates that Silverlight 3 is installed, as shown in the following picture:  What just happened? We installed Silverlight 3 Tools for Visual Studio, Expression Blend 3 for Silverlight 3, .NET RIA  Services, and Silverlight Toolkit.   Now, we have everything we need to begin creating and testing amazing 2D games using  Silverlight 3 and C.  Time for action – recognizing digital art assets One of the best ways of explaining a new game idea is showing it in a very nice picture. This  is exactly what you want to do. However, it is very difficult to find a new game idea from  scratch. Therefore, in working out how to impress the legendary game developer, you ask for  some help in an 8-bit retro gaming community. You meet a legendary space shooter games'  expert and he shows you many remakes of the classic 8-bit Invader game—also known as   [ 12 ]   Space Invaders. The remakes are too simple and they do not exploit modern widescreen  displays, as they run in very low resolutions inside the web browsers. A dazzling remake   of an Invaders game sounds like a very nice idea!  We are going to take a snapshot of the first scene of one of the most exciting 8-bit  implementations of the Invaders game—the legendary TI Invaders—as shown in the  following picture:  Chapter 1  What just happened? Looking at the TI Invaders scene picture, we can recognize the following digital art assets:            Green aliens Blue aliens Red aliens Tents to protect our ship against the aliens' attack A ship  [ 13 ]   Lights, Camera, and Action!  These assets are organized as shown in the following picture:  The aliens are organized in five rows and eleven columns. There are four tents and just one  ship to challenge all these aggressive invaders.  Time for action – creating the raster digital content This prehistoric game used a 256X192 pixels screen  49,152 pixels . We are going to prepare  raster digital assets for the game optimized for a 1680X1050 pixels screen  1,764,000 pixels .  The game should look nice when compared to the older version.  The old version used 8X8 pixels raster digital assets. In this new version, we can use 50X50  pixels raster digital assets.  The creation of raster digital assets for a 2D game is very complex and  requires professional skills. Digital artists and graphic designers are very  important members of a professional game development team. They  provide great quality digital assets to the programming team.  [ 14 ]   As you do not have access to professional digital artists yet, you must download some  freeware icons and then prepare them to be a part of a game demonstration. Luckily, you  will find some nice space and zoom-eyed creatures in PNG  Portable Network Graphics   format that are free to download from Turbomilk  a professional visual interface design  company, http:  turbomilk.com . They are ideal to use in the game.  Chapter 1  PNG is an open, extensible image format with lossless compression.  Silverlight 3 works great with PNG images. I recommend not using the JPEG   Joint Photographic Experts Group  format for foreground digital assets or  iconic graphics because it uses a lossy compression method that removes  some information from the image.  First, we are going to download, manipulate, resize, and finally save the new versions of the  new raster digital content for the game:  1.	 Download the PNG images for the green, blue, and red aliens, the tents, and the   ship. You can take some nice images from http:  turbomilk.com downloads .  2.	 Save all the original PNG images in a new folder  C:\Silverlight3D\  Invaders\GAME_PNGS , as shown in the following picture:  3.	 Open the images for the aliens, ship, and tents using an image-manipulation   tool. You can use a free and open source software such as GIMP  the GNU Image  Manipulation Program  that is available at http:  www.gimp.org, or a  commercial software such as Adobe Photoshop available at http:  www.adobe. com, or free software such as Picasa available at http:  picasa.google.com.  [ 15 ]   Lights, Camera, and Action!  4.	 Remove the shadows from the images because we are not going to use them as   icons. You can select the shadows and delete them using the magic wand tool   fuzzy select tool . It requires high precision in the selection to avoid deleting  the original drawing. Shadows have to be removed because we want to use  them as raster content for the game, as shown in the following picture:  5.	 Remove the transparent pixels from the images  that is, erase the selection . 6.	 Resize the images for the aliens and the ship to 50X50 pixels square, while  keeping proportions. Save them in a PNG format using the following names:          ALIEN_01_01.png—the blue alien, the octopus ALIEN_02_01.png—the red alien, the gothic cherry ALIEN_03_01.png—the green alien, the eye SHIP_01_01.png—the ship  7.	 Resize the image for the tents to 100X100 pixels square, while keeping  proportions. Save it in a PNG format using the name TENT_01_01.png.  8.	 Now, copy the newly manipulated and resized images in a   new folder  C:\Silverlight3D\Invaders\GAME_PNGS_ RESIZED , as shown in the following picture:  [ 16 ]   Chapter 1  What just happened? We created raster digital content for the game optimized for a 1680X1050 pixels screen. We  downloaded some images, and manipulated them to remove the shadows and prepare them  for the game's main scene. We used a naming convention for the images as we want to keep  everything well organized for the game.  The game will look nice using these modern raster digital art assets.  Digital Content Creation tools The Digital Content Creation tools  DCC  are very important partners for game designers and  developers. They allow digital artists and graphic designers to concentrate on the creation of  different kinds of digital art assets, which are then used in the applications.  We can also use everything we are learning in developing the applications that  have intensive graphical resources. However, we will call them games in the  rest of the book.  It is very easy to understand their purpose using an example. If you want to show a sky with  stars as an application's background, the easiest way to do it is by loading a bitmap  PNG, BMP,  JPG, and so on  using the procedures or controls provided by the programming language.  A digital artist will create and manipulate the sky bitmap using an image manipulation tool  such as GIMP, Photoshop, or Picasa.  Developing games requires the usage of a great number of resources; it is not just  programming tasks. We are going to use many popular DCC tools during our journey to  create Silverlight 3D games. As many of these tools are very expensive, we will use some  open source and free alternatives to carry out the most important tasks.  A good practice before beginning 2D and 3D game development is to research the tools   used to create the 2D and 3D digital content. This way, we will have a better idea of how  to create the different scenes and the most common techniques. Later, we will learn the  programming techniques used to give life to these graphics-related operations. We will be  able to provide great real-time interaction to all these digital content assets, as shown in   the following diagram:  2D images  3D models  Effects definitions  Maps  Game  Programming   loading, drawing, logic, and control   [ 17 ]   Lights, Camera, and Action!  Basic elements of a 2D and or 3D real-time game A modern 2D and or 3D real-time game uses the basic elements shown in the previous  diagram. Let's go through them in the following list:          2D images: These can be raster bitmaps as used in our previous example, or vector  graphics—also known as vector-based illustrations. In some cases, they are useful as  a background made of a starry sky, or a cloudy sky. In other cases, they are used as  textures to envelope different 3D objects. For example, a 2D brick's image is used as  a texture to envelope a 3D object representing a wall. 3D models: These contain information about the representations of primitive elements   point, lines, triangles, and polygons  to create great meshes, similar to a wire mesh  that describes a 3D model. Their different parts can be enveloped by textures. Then  everything renders in a representation in the 2D space shown by the players' screens. Effects definitions: These can be applied to 3D models to offer more realism in the  production of many scenes. To simplify the development process, there are many  specific programming languages used to define the behavior of effects. Maps: It is easier to create real-time digital content using different kinds of maps  and diverse proprietary formats. Maps can specify the location of the different kinds  of houses and trees in a game that involves driving a car in a city. It is possible to  create many levels based on the same logic and behavior programmed for a game,  but by using many different maps.  Many specialized DCC tools help in creating the basic elements explained in the  aforementioned list. For example, using GIMP you can see the alpha channel for the ship's  PNG image, as shown in the following picture:  [ 1 ]   Programming responsibilities We do not have to write lines of code dedicated to creating an image. Instead, modern game  programming focuses on the following tasks:  Chapter 1        Loading: We must load 2D images, 3D models, textures, effects definitions, and  maps using different kinds of content loaders, parsers, import techniques, and  translators. They are going to help us in transforming the original file formats to the  ones supported by the programming language and the framework used to develop  the game. Drawing: A game's main goal is to show real-time graphics content in a screen.   One of the main problems is that 3D scenes have to be shown in a screen capable   of showing just two of these three dimensions. Logic and control: While the content is being loaded and shown, it is necessary to  apply some AI  Artificial Intelligence  to logic operations, and to provide feedback  according to the controls offered to the user for certain game actors and aspects.  In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to develop accurate time-management  techniques coordinated with the information obtained from the hardware applied  to control the game—the keyboard, mouse, racing wheel, gamepad, or the Wiimote   Wii Remote , among others. All of these tasks must be done while managing many  heterogeneous pieces and showing a very complex audiovisual production. Thus,   we must take into account everything related to the execution speed and issues   of performance.  Programming games requires more knowledge about the underlying hardware on which  the game will be run. We must establish performance baselines and minimum requisites to  achieve a desirable performance for the game. Besides, we must specify the recommended  input devices to take full advantage of the game. These tasks could seem pretty trivial, but  they are very important because some games are very complex and demand many difficult  optimizations to be able to run on the mainstream hardware available.  This is a simple summary of a game's programming responsibilities. We will work through  them all throughout this book.  Time for action – installing tools to manipulate  scalable digital content Your cell phone rings. An old friend sees your name in the participants' list and calls you  because he has some interesting information. He tells you the game has to scale to huge  resolutions such as the ones found in exclusive XHD  eXtreme High Definition  displays.  These displays can support resolutions as high as 2560X1600 pixels.  [ 1 ]   Lights, Camera, and Action!  Scaling the raster digital assets is a big problem because pixelation becomes easily visible.  If you scale the final alien for using it in a higher resolution, it will look really pixelated as  shown in the following picture:  You want the game to use the entire screen space, even in the XHD displays. To make this  possible, you could prepare another set of raster digital assets for the game optimized for  a 2560X1600 pixels screen  4,096,000 pixels . However, the game can also be run using a  1920X1080 pixels screen  2,073,600 pixels . There is another alternative of creating a new  set of scalable vector graphics  vector-based illustrations , which are ready to scale to any  screen resolution without generating pixelation problems.  This way, you can provide two versions of the same game—one using raster digital assets  optimized for a 1680X1050 pixels screen and the other using scalable vector graphics.   There is no restriction in the number of games per participant. Therefore, you can submit  both versions.  The creation of scalable vector graphics assets for a 2D game is very complex  and involves professional skills. We are going to simplify this process by using  the existing clipart.  First, we must download and install some additional tools that will help us in converting the  existing scalable vector graphics to the most appropriate file formats to use in Silverlight 3:  The necessary tools will depend on the applications the digital artists use to  create the scalable vector graphics. However, we will be using some tools that  will work fine with our examples.  [ 20 ]   1.	 Download the following files:  Application name Download link Expression  Design  http:  www. microsoft.com  expression  products  Overview. aspx?key=design http:   inkscape. org download  ?lang=en  File name Design_ Trial_ en.exe  Inkscape- 0.46. win32.exe  Inkscape  Chapter 1  Description It is a commercial tool, but the  trial offers a free fully functional  version for 30 days. This tool will  enable us to transform vector  assets to the appropriate format  for use in Silverlight 3. It is a very complete free, open  source, vector drawing program.  This tool will enable us to import  many vector assets in different,  popular file formats and export  them to a format recognized by  Expression Design.  2.	 Run the installers and follow the steps to complete the installation wizards. 3.	 Once Inkscape's installation is finished, you will be able to load and edit many   vector assets in different file formats as shown in the following picture:  [ 21 ]   Lights, Camera, and Action!  What just happened? We installed Expression Design and Inkscape. Now we have the necessary tools to convert  the existing vector clipart to the most appropriate formats to use in Silverlight 3.  XAML works fine with Silverlight 3 Why do we need to install so many tools to create a simple vector asset to use in Silverlight  3? It's because Silverlight 3 uses XAML  eXtensible Application Markup Language , and the  best way to add scalable vector content is using objects defined in XAML. However, many  tools that offer functions to export to XAML do not work as expected and are not compatible  with Silverlight 3. Besides, many converters are still in alpha versions and have problems  when we need to convert complex vector art.  The game must be finished on or before the due date. Therefore, to avoid problems related  to XAML vector assets, we are going to perform additional steps. But we will be sure that the  resulting XAML will work fine with Silverlight 3.  Time for action – creating the scalable digital content in XAML As you do not have access to professional digital artists yet, you must download some free  clipart and then prepare it to be a part of a scalable game demonstration. This time, you  want to offer a different version of the game by mixing some Halloween monsters  the new  invaders  with the ship. This will be the vector-graphics based game. Luckily, you find some  nice, free-to-use clipart in WMF  Windows Meta-File  scalable vector format from Microsoft  Office Clipart. They are great to use for offering a different scalable version of the game.  WMF is an old, scalable vector format. Silverlight 3 does not offer direct  support for WMF graphics. Therefore, we must convert WMF graphics to XAML.  Following the next steps, we can also convert from any vector formats supported  by Inkscape such as SVG  Scalable Vector Graphics , AI  Adobe Illustrator , PDF   Adobe PDF , and EMF  Enhanced Meta-File  among others.  First, we are going to download, organize, and convert some scalable vector graphics to  XAML which is compatible with Silverlight 3:  1.	 Download or copy the vector graphics for the green, blue, and red aliens, the   tents, and the ship. Remember that this version is themed on Halloween monsters.  You can take some nice graphics from the Microsoft Office Clipart Collection.  [ 22 ]   2.	 Save all of the original WMF images in a new folder  C:\Silverlight3D\  Invaders\GAME_WMFS , as shown in the following picture:  Chapter 1  3.	 Repeat the following steps  4 to 13  for each vector graphic  WMF file . 4.	 Open the vector graphic file in Inkscape. 5.	 Select File  Save a copy…. A dialog box showing many export options will appear. 6.	 Remove the extension from the filename. For example, if the filename   shown is ALIEN_01_01.wmf, the new name will be ALIEN_01_01.  7.	 Choose the PDF via Cairo  *.PDF  option in the combo box that lists the  available file formats to export. Click on Save and then on OK. Now, you  will have the vector graphic as a PDF file. You will be able to open the file  using any PDF reader such as Adobe Acrobat Reader or Foxit Reader.  8.	 Rename the new PDF file and change its PDF extension to AI.  For example, if the file name generated by Inkscape is ALIEN_ 01_01.pdf, the new name will be ALIEN_01_01.ai.   9.	 Now, open the file with the .ai extension in Microsoft Expression Design. 10.	 Select File  Export…. A dialog box with many export options will appear.  [ 23 ]   Lights, Camera, and Action!  11.	 Choose XAML Silverlight Canvas in the Format combo box under Export properties.  Now, you will be able to see a nice image preview as shown in the following picture:  12.	 Click on Browse… and choose the destination folder for the new   XAML file  C:\Silverlight3D\Invaders\GAME_XAML .  13.	 Click on Export All and Expression Design will create the XAML file. You can  preview the XAML file in Internet Explorer, as shown in the following picture:  [ 24 ]   Chapter 1  What just happened? We created scalable vector graphics and converted them to an XAML format, which is  compatible with Silverlight 3. We downloaded some images and used a process to convert  them to a format that Microsoft Expression Design can read. As this tool does not work with  WMF files, we needed to provide an AI-compatible format.  We converted the files to a PDF format, which is compatible with the newest AI formats.  Expression Design can read this format, but it requires the files to have the .ai extension.  That is why we needed to rename the files exported from Inkscape as PDF.  We used Inkscape because it is free, open source, and compatible with the most popular  scalable vector graphics formats. However, we did not export to XAML from Inkscape  because there are some incompatibilities in that conversion. The most secure way to export  to XAML these days is using Expression Design.  This scalable vector content for the game could be optimized for any resolution. We used the  same naming convention previously employed by the raster graphics, as we want to keep  everything well organized for the two versions of the game. One will show raster aliens and  the other, scalable Halloween monsters.  The game will look nice on XHD monitors using these scalable vector art assets.  Previewing and scaling XAML vector graphics The XAML vector graphics can scale while keeping their quality intact when they are used in  Silverlight 3 applications. This is not new; this happened with all the vector graphics formats.  Scaling the vector graphics is not a problem because they do not have pixelation problems.  However, they require more processing time than raster graphics to be shown on a screen.  If you scale one of the Halloween monsters to use it in a higher resolution, it will look really  great as shown in the following picture:  [ 25 ]   Lights, Camera, and Action!  A very interesting hidden tool that can help us when working with XAML and XAML vector  graphics is XamlPad.  XamlPad is a part of the WPF  Windows Presentation Foundation  SDK. Once Visual Studio  is installed, it is available in the following folder: Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\ Windows\v6.0A\bin. You must create a manual shortcut to XamlPad.exe in that folder  because it is not available in a menu shortcut.  Time for action – testing the scalable digital content  using XamlPad Now, we are going to test how an XAML vector graphic scales using XamlPad:  1.	 Open one of the XAML vector graphics exported by   Expression Design using Windows Notepad.  2.	 Select all of the text and copy it to the clipboard. 3.	 Run XamlPad. 4.	 Paste the clipboard's content  the XAML definition  in the XAML area. You will see   the illustration appearing in the top panel, as shown in the following picture:  [ 26 ]   5.	 Change the zoom many times, taking into account that you can   enter manual values. You will see the illustration appearing  with different sizes without pixelation problems.  6.	 Click on Show Hide the visual tree. The Visual Tree Explorer and Property   Tree Explorer will allow you to navigate through the different components of  this scalable XAML vector illustration, as shown in the following picture:  Chapter 1  What just happened? We used a very simple yet handy tool called XamlPad to preview XAML-scalable vector  illustrations. Now, we are sure that the scalable clipart for the game is going to work fine in  different resolutions. We can include these vector illustrations in Silverlight 3 applications.  Editing vector illustrations using Expression Design Expression Design is a very useful tool if we need to create special effects with 2D XAML  vector graphics. Using this tool, a digital artist can create and manipulate vector graphics.  Also, this tool can define a name for each shape. Thus, we can later add some code to  change some of the properties of these shapes by using the names to identify them.  [ 27 ]   Lights, Camera, and Action!  For example, we can change an eye's color. However, we need 2D XAML vector graphics  that use nice names to identify each shape. The following picture shows Expression Design  editing our well-known Halloween monster to provide nice names for the shapes that define  the eye's background and background border:  Using expression design, we can also add effects to many shapes and layers. Hence, if we are  going to work hard with Silverlight 3, it is a very important tool for the digital artists involved  in the project.  Our main goal is to develop games using Silverlight 3. However, it is very  important to understand the preparation of digital art assets.   [ 2 ]   Chapter 1  Have a go hero – preparing scalable digital content for a new remake You have to win the game contest. As you know, there is no restriction on the number  of games per participant. What about preparing another completely different game to  participate in this contest?  Take a classic game that is based one screen and does not have scrolling capabilities, similar  to the Invaders game. Prepare scalable vector graphics in an XAML format to represent  its characters. However, this time, prepare some additional animation frames for each  character. We will use them in the following chapter to prepare that game using a   new framework.  You can do it. If you are not a good artist, you can download free clipart from the Web and  then use the techniques and tools previously explained to create vector graphics in XAML  format that are ready for use in Silverlight 3 games.  Preparing a gaming framework  Silverlight 3 does not provide a gaming framework. However, it offers outstanding   graphics-rendering capabilities that are combined with really useful time-management  features. Hence, we will have to add some code to prepare a framework to simplify the  development of games, combining the powerful C programming language and the   flexibility of XAML.  We will have to work harder in our initial games because we will be preparing a gaming  framework. However, once we have the framework, we will be able to develop new games  reusing a lot of code. Thus, we can focus more on the game behavior and graphic effects.  Time for action – creating Silverlight applications First of all, you have to create a Silverlight application and see how it works in a web browser.  To best understand how it works, we can see it in action and experience a vector graphic  moving on the screen while the mouse pointer changes its position. These are the steps   to do it:  1.	 Create a new C project using the Silverlight Application template in Visual   Studio or Visual C Express. Use SilverlightMonster.Web as the project's name.  [ 2 ]   Lights, Camera, and Action!  2.	 The IDE is going to present a dialog box showing many options for a new   Silverlight application. Activate the Host the Silverlight application in  a new Web site checkbox, as shown in the following screenshot:  3.	 Click on OK and the IDE will create an empty Silverlight application,   including a Web project. The Web project will allow us to change  some properties to configure the Silverlight runtime.  4.	 Right-click on SilverlightMonster  the main project  in the Solution Explorer   and select Add  Existing item… from the context menu that appears.  5.	 Choose the destination folder for the previously generated XAML  files  C:\Silverlight3D\Invaders\GAME_XAML  and select  a vector asset  ALIEN_01_01.xaml . Now click on Add.  [ 30 ]   6.	 Select the recently added item  ALIEN_01_01.xaml  in Solution Explorer and right-  click on it. You will not be able to see the graphic in the IDE's screen. Select Open  in Expression Blend. A security-warning dialog box will appear. Do not worry; the  project is secure. Click on Yes. Now, the project will be opened in Expression Blend  and you will see the vector graphic on the screen, as shown in the following picture:  Chapter 1  7.	 Right-click on the canvas named Layer_3 under Objects and  Timeline window, and select Make Into UserControl… in the  context menu that appears. A dialog box will appear.  8.	 Enter the name Ghost for this new UserControl and click on OK. A new item will  be added to the SilverlightMonster project named Ghost.xaml. Save the changes  and go back to Visual Studio or Visual C, and reload the contents of the solution.  [ 31 ]   Lights, Camera, and Action!  9.	 Now, you will be able to see the graphics representation of this   UserControl in Visual Studio or Visual C. Expand Ghost.xaml in the  Solution explorer and you will find Ghost.xaml.cs  the C code related  to the XAML UserControl , as shown in the following picture:  Silverlight 3 RTW  Ready To Web  made the default XAML preview capabilities  invisible for Silverlight projects in Visual C 2008. We have to resize the preview  panel in order to see the graphics representation. The preview capabilities are  available without changes in Visual Studio 2010 or Visual C 2010.  What just happened? You created your first Silverlight application showing the ghost that will be a part of your  game. It required too many steps, and you had to combine two tools: Visual Studio or Visual  C, and Expression Blend. It seems complex, but once you get used to working with graphic  manipulation tools and development environments to create Silverlight games, it is going to  be easier.  We created a new web site to host our Silverlight application because that is going to allow  us to change many advanced parameters related to Silverlight's runtime that are very useful  to improve the performance of our games.  We created a UserControl from an existing XAML-scalable vector illustration. A  UserControl has its XAML representation and provides its own logic.  [ 32 ]   Time for action – building and running Silverlight applications Now, you want to see the ghost moving on the screen while the mouse pointer changes its  position. In order to do this, we must add some code to show the ghost and to move it. We  will add both XAML and C code as follows:  Chapter 1  1.	 Stay in the SilverlightMonster project. 2.	 Open the XAML code for MainPage.xaml  double-click on it in the  Solution Explorer  and replace the existing code with the following: <UserControl x:Class="SilverlightMonster.MainPage"   xmlns="http:  schemas.microsoft.com winfx 2006 xaml          presentation"   xmlns:x="http:  schemas.microsoft.com winfx 2006 xaml"    Cursor="None"   Width="1366" Height="768" MouseMove="Ghost_MouseMove"   xmlns:SilverlightMonster="clr-namespace:SilverlightMonster">   <Canvas x:Name="cnvMovementTest" Width="1366" Height="768"           Background="Bisque">      <SilverlightMonster:Ghost Canvas.Left="10" Canvas.Top="10"                                x:Name="ghost" >        3.	 You will see the ghost appearing in the upper-left corner of the page in the designer. 4.	 Now, expand MainPage.xaml in the Solution Explorer and open    MainPage.xaml.cs  double-click on it . We need to add an event handler to  move the ghost on the screen to the position where the mouse has moved. 5.	 Add the following lines of code in the public partial class MainPage :   UserControl to program the event handler for the MouseMove event: private void Ghost_MouseMove object sender, MouseEventArgs e  {      Get the mouse current position   Point point = e.GetPosition cnvMovementTest ;      Set the canvas Left property to the mouse X position   ghost.SetValue Canvas.LeftProperty, point.X ;      Set the canvas Top property to the mouse Y position   ghost.SetValue Canvas.TopProperty, point.Y ; }  [ 33 ]   Lights, Camera, and Action!  6.	 Build and run the solution. The IDE will ask whether you want to turn on debugging  or not. It is always convenient to click on Yes because you will need to debug many  times. The default web browser will appear showing a bisque background and the  ghost will move following the mouse pointer, as shown in the following picture:  What just happened? The ghost appeared in the web browser and it moved through the bisque rectangle as   if it were a mouse pointer. You created and ran your first Silverlight application in the   web browser.  First, we changed the XAML code for MainPage.xaml. We made some changes to do   the following:    Hide the mouse pointer  the cursor : <UserControl x:Class="SilverlightMonster.MainPage"   xmlns="http:  schemas.microsoft.com winfx 2006 xaml          presentation"    xmlns:x="http:  schemas.microsoft.com winfx 2006 xaml"    Cursor="None"    Specify width and height of 1366X768 pixels: Width="1366" Height="768"  [ 34 ]   Chapter 1  Indicate a MouseMove event handler: MouseMove="Ghost_MouseMove"      Reference the SilverlightMonster namespace to allow access to the definitions  specified in it: xmlns:SilverlightMonster="clr-namespace:SilverlightMonster">  Then, we added a Canvas named cnvMovementTest  with a 1366X768 pixels width and  height , a bisque background, and an instance of Ghost  SilverlightMonster:Ghost   named ghost located in the point  10, 10  taking into account both the Canvas and its  upper-left corner:  <Canvas x:Name="cnvMovementTest" Width="1366" Height="768"         Background="Bisque">   <SilverlightMonster:Ghost Canvas.Left="10" Canvas.Top="10"                              x:Name="ghost" >    Programming event handlers in the main page Once the ghost was shown using XAML code, we had to program code for the event handler,  which is triggered when the mouse moves on the main page's UserControl. We had  indicated the MouseMove event handler as Ghost_MouseMove. For this reason, we   defined a private void method with that name in the C class MainPage, associated with   the previously explained XAML.  As mentioned earlier, we defined the cnvMovementTest Canvas in the XAML section.   The code in the event is very simple. However, it interacts with some elements defined in   the XAML code.  The following line retrieves the mouse's current position as an instance of Point—a 2D  vector, with two coordinates  X and Y :  Point point = e.GetPosition cnvMovementTest ;  Now we call the SetValue method for ghost  the instance of Ghost is already defined in  the XAML section . We assign the values of the X and Y coordinates of the 2D vector to the  Left and Top properties of the canvas containing the ghost illustration:  ghost.SetValue Canvas.LeftProperty, point.X ; ghost.SetValue Canvas.TopProperty, point.Y ;  We can create visual objects, such as the ghost of this example, in XAML or  using C code. Sometimes, it is more convenient to use XAML, whereas at  other times it is more convenient to use C code. It depends on the kind of  application we are developing.  [ 35 ]   Lights, Camera, and Action!  Time for action – creating XBAP WPF applications Silverlight is a subset of WPF. One of the great advantages of Silverlight applications is that  they just require a plugin installed in the web browser to run. However, sometimes, we need  to develop games that require more power than what is being provided by Silverlight. In  those cases, we can create an XBAP  XAML Browser Application  WPF application by making  some small changes to the source code.  XBAP WPF applications are not based on Silverlight. They are .NET WPF  applications capable of running in a sandbox  to avoid security problems   inside a web browser. They run with Internet zone permissions and require  the entire .NET framework to be installed on the computer that wants to run  them. Therefore, they have some limitations when compared with the classic  .NET WPF applications that run on the desktop. The XBAP WPF applications  are an interesting alternative when the power of Silverlight is not enough.  Now, you want to create the same application that worked with Silverlight as an XBAP   WPF application. If you need more power in any of your games, you will want to have   the alternative to work with the XBAP WPF applications.   1.	 Create a new C project using the WPF Browser Application template  in Visual Studio or Visual C Express. Use SilverlightMonsterXBAP  as the project's name. You will see a slightly different IDE, as it allows  access to most of the WPF applications' features and controls.  2.	 Right-click on SilverlightMonsterXBAP in the Solution Explorer and   select Add  Existing item… from the context menu that appears. 3.	 Choose the destination folder for the previously generated XAML  files  C:\Silverlight3D\Invaders\GAME_XAML  and select  a vector asset  ALIEN_01_01.xaml . Now click on Add.  4.	 Select the recently added item  ALIEN_01_01.xaml  in the Solution Explorer and  double-click on it. In this case, you will be able to see the graphic in the IDE's screen.  5.	 Select Project  Add User Control… from the main menu. A dialog box will appear. 6.	 Enter the name Ghost for this new UserControl and click on OK. A new item  will be added to the SilverlightMonsterXBAP project, named Ghost.xaml.  7.	 Open the XAML code for ALIEN_01_01.xaml. Copy from the   following line to the line before the last  : <Canvas x:Name="Layer_3" Width="193.333" Height="128"         Canvas.Left="0" Canvas.Top="0">  [ 36 ]   Chapter 1  8.	 Open the XAML code for Ghost.xaml. Remove the following text  as we   want the UserControl to take the size from the ghost illustration : Height="300" Width="300" 9.	 You will see the following code:  <UserControl x:Class="SilverlightMonsterXBAP.Ghost2"   xmlns="http:  schemas.microsoft.com winfx 2006 xaml          presentation"   xmlns:x="http:  schemas.microsoft.com winfx 2006 xaml">                       10.	 Select the lines from   to    inclusive  that define a Grid,  and paste the XAML code previously copied from ALIEN_01_01.xaml.  11.	 Now, you will see the graphics representation of this UserControl in Visual  Studio or Visual C. Expand Ghost.xaml in the Solution explorer and you will  find Ghost.xaml.cs  the C code related to the XAML UserControl  as  shown in the following picture, but this time in a XBAP WPF application:  [ 37 ]   Lights, Camera, and Action!  What just happened? You created your first XBAP WPF application showing the ghost that will be a part of your  future game. It required some steps that were different from those you learned to create   this same application for Silverlight.  We created a WPF UserControl from an existing XAML scalable vector illustration. Once  we create the UserControl, the steps and the code required are very similar to the ones  explained for the Silverlight version. However, it is very interesting to understand the whole  development process.  Time for action – building and running the  XBAP WPF applications Now, you want to see the ghost moving on the screen as an XBAP WPF application while the  mouse pointer changes its position. In order to do this, we must add some code to show the  ghost and to move it. We will add both XAML and C code as follows:  1.	 Stay in the SilverlightMonsterXBAP project. 2.	 Open the XAML code for Page1.xaml  double-click on it in the Solution   Explorer  and replace the existing code with the following: <Page x:Class="SilverlightMonsterXBAP.Page1"   xmlns="http:  schemas.microsoft.com winfx 2006 xaml          presentation"   xmlns:x="http:  schemas.microsoft.com winfx 2006 xaml"   Title="Page1"    Cursor="None">   <Canvas Width="1366" Height="768" MouseMove="Ghost_MouseMove"           xmlns:SilverlightMonsterXBAP=           "clr-namespace:SilverlightMonsterXBAP">     <Canvas x:Name="cnvMovementTest" Width="1366" Height="768"             Background="Bisque">       <SilverlightMonsterXBAP:Ghost Canvas.Left="10"                     Canvas.Top="10" x:Name="ghost" >              3.	 You will see the ghost appearing in the upper-left corner of the page in the designer.  [ 3 ]   Chapter 1  4.	 Expand Page1.xaml in the Solution Explorer and open Page1.xaml.cs     double-click on it . We need to add an event handler to move the ghost  on the screen to the position to which the mouse has moved.  5.	 Add the same lines of code previously explained for the Silverlight   version in the public partial class Page1 : Page to  program the event handler for the MouseMove event.  6.	 Build and run the solution. The default web browser will appear showing a   bisque background and the ghost will move following the mouse pointer. This  time, it is running an XBAP WPF application, as shown in the following picture:  What just happened? The ghost appeared in the web browser and moved through the bisque rectangle as if it  were a mouse pointer. The application looked very similar to its Silverlight version. However,  in this case, you have access to most of the WPF features and controls. You created and ran  an XBAP WPF application in the web browser.  XBAP WPF applications require more time to start than Silverlight applications.  Therefore, we should not confuse Silverlight with XBAP WPF. They are two  different technologies. However, we can transform a Silverlight application  to an XBAP WPF application by making small changes to the source code, as  shown in this example.  [ 3 ]         Lights, Camera, and Action!  First, we changed the XAML code for Page1.xaml. We made some changes to do   the following:  Hide the mouse pointer  the cursor  using the following code: <Page x:Class="SilverlightMonsterXBAP.Page1"     xmlns="http:  schemas.microsoft.com winfx 2006 xaml  presentation"     xmlns:x="http:  schemas.microsoft.com winfx 2006 xaml"     Title="Page1"      Cursor="None">  Replace the Grid definition with a Canvas and indicate a MouseMove event handler: MouseMove="Ghost_MouseMove" Reference the SilverlightMonsterXBAP namespace to allow access to the  definitions specified in it: xmlns:SilverlightMonsterXBAP="clr-namespace: SilverlightMonsterXBAP">  Next, we added a Canvas named cnvMovementTest with a resolution of 1366X768  pixels  width and height , a bisque background, and showed an instance of Ghost   SilverlightMonster:Ghost  named ghost located on the point  10, 10  by taking   into account both the Canvas and its upper-left corner:  <Canvas x:Name="cnvMovementTest" Width="1366" Height="768"  Background="Bisque">   <SilverlightMonsterXBAP:Ghost Canvas.Left="10" Canvas.Top="10"                                 x:Name="ghost" >    Once the ghost is shown using XAML code, we had to program the code for the event handler  that triggered when the mouse moved on the main page's UserControl. We followed the  same procedure previously explained in the Silverlight version of this application.  Have a go hero – creating a prototype for the remake You receive an email from the game contest. They require each participant to send a  Silverlight prototype of the first scene of the game without movement—a still snapshot.  Using the scalable vector graphics in an XAML format prepared for the Invader game, create  a new Silverlight application that reproduces the first screen of the game with the aliens  organized in five rows and eleven columns, the four tents, and the ship.  You can do it creating one UserControl for each vector graphics as we did for the ghost.  Now, you can organize a nice Silverlight prototype by defining a Canvas for each alien and  tent, and then for the ship using 2D coordinates.

[ 41 ]   Lights, Camera, and Action!  Summary  We learned a lot in this chapter about digital content recognition, manipulation, conversion,  and creation. Specifically, we prepared a development environment and the tools to  work with 2D content and Silverlight 3. We recognized digital art assets from an existing  game—the legendary Invaders. We created and prepared digital content for two new 2D  games—one raster art based and the other vector graphics based. We understood the  different tools involved in a 2D game development process and learned many techniques to  manipulate, convert, preview, and scale digital content. We acknowledged the advantages of  vector-based graphics as well as its performance trade-offs. We created our first Silverlight  application using vector-based XAML graphics, and then developed an XBAP WPF version of  the same application. Now, we are able to begin preparing and organizing the digital content  for a simple yet impressive 2D game.  Now that we've learned about the principles of development environment preparation   and digital content manipulation, we're ready to learn the techniques to work with   2D characters in a 2D game and to manage resolutions and frameworks, which is the   topic of the next chapter.  [ 42 ]   2  Working with 2D Characters  In order to create first-rate games, we must show moving graphics on the  screen. This seems to be a pretty simple task. However, it requires writing   smart code in C to avoid losing control over some important aspects of a  game, such as the speed of the image's movement and the time it takes to  render the animations in different computers.  In this chapter, we will begin creating 2D characters that move on the screen and also learn  to control their behavior in a 2D space. We will:          Prepare a project to take advantage of Silverlight 3's performance enhancements for  graphics-intensive applications Learn to perform hardware-accelerated transformations on multiple art assets Animate images in a 2D space working with vectors, speed, and direction Understand locations, resolutions, and dimensions  Creating an accelerated graphics viewport  So far, we have prepared a development environment to develop games using Silverlight  3, and we have created some digital art assets for new remakes of an old game. We have  developed a very simple Silverlight and XBAP WPF application to show a ghost moving like  a mouse pointer. However, games require something more impressive. How can we exploit  modern hardware in Silverlight to accelerate the production of real-time graphics on   the screen?   Working with 2D Characters  WPF applications take advantage of the power offered by modern GPUs  Graphics  Processing Units , also known as accelerated graphics cards. This specialized hardware runs  common and complex procedures related to 2D and 3D graphics, and they free the CPU   Central Processing Unit  from this weight load.  Unfortunately, Silverlight 3 does not take full advantage of modern GPUs. However, it offers  the possibility to use the GPU for some operations. Under certain circumstances, we can  improve the performance of a game using the hardware-acceleration capabilities offered   by Silverlight 3.  Time for action – enabling hardware acceleration A good game must run offering smooth animation and good-looking graphics on the  screen. Let's assume you have some doubts about the performance offered by Silverlight 3.  Therefore, you decide to make some changes to the application developed in the previous  chapter in order to test hardware acceleration. Hence, you will be able to develop games  exploiting some of the features offered by modern GPUs in Silverlight.  Now, we are going to show more ghosts moving on the screen, but this time doing some  transformations and using some hardware acceleration:  We need a computer with a GPU or accelerated graphics card compatible  with DirectX 9.0c installed in order to achieve significant results for the  next experience.  1.  Stay in the SilverlightMonster project. 2.  Open the ASPX code for SilverlightMonsterTestPage.aspx  by double-  clicking on it in the Solution Explorer, found under the SilverlightMonster.Web  project . This is the ASPX test page for the project that creates the Silverlight control  host, which runs the generated Silverlight application  the .xap file .  3.  Find the section beginning with the following line of code:  <object data="data:application x-silverlight-2," 4.  In this project, the first two complete lines are the following: <object data="data:application x-silverlight-2,"          type="application x-silverlight-2" width="100%"          height="100%">      [ 44 ]   5.  Insert the following line of code after the line that begins with <param   name="source".  We are setting the EnableGPUAcceleration boolean  parameter to true for the Silverlight plugin instance.     6.  The last part of the ASPX code that creates the Silverlight control host will be similar   to the following screenshot:  Chapter 2  What just happened? We changed a parameter that enabled GPU acceleration for some operations in the  Silverlight host control. However, that is not enough to guarantee that Silverlight will   use the GPU. We have to make some additional changes to the user interface elements    UI elements  shown by the application, and we have to perform the operations that benefit  from hardware acceleration.  Time for action – transforming media using the GPU We are going to make some changes to the application. This time, we will show eight   ghosts. We will configure some additional parameters to allow hardware acceleration for  some operations and we will scale, rotate, and translate them. At the same time, we will   be changing their opacity settings:  1.  Stay in the SilverlightMonster project. 2.  Open the XAML code for Ghost.xaml. Remove only the following two lines that  define a Grid named LayoutRoot as we want the illustration to be a part of a  Canvas instead of a Grid:      [ 45 ]   Working with 2D Characters  3.  Change the name of the main Canvas from "Layer_3" to "LayoutRoot"     the default value for the root element .  4.  Add the following lines after the first line that begins with the definition of the main  Canvas.  We are assigning the BitmapCache value to the CacheMode property of  the Canvas that contains the ghost's paths.           5.  Now, add the following lines after the first line that begins with the definition of the  main Canvas.  We are defining two transforms for this Canvas—scale and rotate.            <ScaleTransform x:Name="scaleGhost" ScaleX="1.5" ScaleY="1.5"       >              After adding the aforementioned lines, you will see the ghost bigger  in the preview panel because you scaled both its width  ScaleX   and height  ScaleY  1.5 times.  6.  Open the XAML code for MainPage.xaml and create seven more instances of the   Ghost UserControl. Add the following lines after the first ghost: <SilverlightMonster:Ghost Canvas.Left="50" Canvas.Top="50"                            x:Name="ghost2" > <SilverlightMonster:Ghost Canvas.Left="100" Canvas.Top="100"                            x:Name="ghost3" > <SilverlightMonster:Ghost Canvas.Left="150" Canvas.Top="150"                            x:Name="ghost4" > <SilverlightMonster:Ghost Canvas.Left="200" Canvas.Top="200"                            x:Name="ghost5" > <SilverlightMonster:Ghost Canvas.Left="250" Canvas.Top="250"                            x:Name="ghost6" > <SilverlightMonster:Ghost Canvas.Left="300" Canvas.Top="300"                            x:Name="ghost7" > <SilverlightMonster:Ghost Canvas.Left="350" Canvas.Top="350"                            x:Name="ghost8" >  [ 46 ]   7.  You will see eight ghosts in the main page preview, aligned as shown in the    following screenshot:  Chapter 2  What just happened? Now, you have eight instances of the Ghost class, created in the XAML code. They have  different positions defined by their Canvas Left and Top properties, as shown in the  following line:  <SilverlightMonster:Ghost Canvas.Left="350" Canvas.Top="350"                            x:Name="ghost8" >  The variable name for this instance is ghost8 and its upper-left corner is shown in X = 350   Canvas.Left  and Y = 350  Canvas.Top .  Remember that we can also create instances of the Ghost  UserControl using the C code.  [ 47 ]   Working with 2D Characters  Caching rendered content  We made some changes in the XAML code for the definition of Ghost UserControl and  the MainPage Canvas.  We assigned the BitmapCache value to the ghost's CacheMode property using the  following lines:           This property determines whether the rendered content should be cached when possible  using the GPU. Its default value is a null reference, meaning that the content should not   be cached.  Setting the value to BitmapCache tells Silverlight to cache this element as a bitmap. Hence,  the GPU will handle any of these three operations on that content:        Transforms: Shrinking and or stretching  scaling , rotating, skewing, and so on Blends: Using opacity settings Clips: Creating rectangular clips  At times we will not notice a great improvement in performance. It depends  on the operations that the game performs on its graphics. If we have a great  number of transforms, blends, and clips, it is very probable that we can  obtain improved performance by caching the rendered content as bitmaps  to use some of the GPU power.  Nevertheless, as the element is cached as a bitmap, we will lose some of the advantages   of the scalable vector graphics. The element will be converted to a raster image in the   GPU memory. Then, the GPU will perform the operations using a raster image, which   is a snapshot of the scalable vector version. There is always a trade-off.  Furthermore, any media element  such as a video that shrinks or stretches  will use  hardware acceleration if we follow the same steps previously explained:      Enable hardware acceleration in the Silverlight control host that runs the application Assign the BitmapCache value to the CacheMode property for each media element  that shrinks or stretches  [ 4 ]   Chapter 2  Scaling and rotating a vector-based illustration We added two transforms for the Canvas, which contains the paths that define the ghost.  They are as follows:      The ScaleTransform, named scaleGhost. It enables us to change its ScaleX  and ScaleY properties to shrink or stretch the vector-based illustration. This is done  in the following line:    The RotateTransform, named rotateGhost. It enables us to change its Angle  property to rotate the vector-based illustration around its central point. This is done  in the following line:    We will be able to change these properties to scale and rotate the ghost, taking into   account the mouse pointer's position using the C code to access the instances created   for ScaleTransform and RotateTransform.  Time for action – shaking many illustrations at the same time  1.	 Stay in the SilverlightMonster project. 2.	 Expand MainPage.xaml in the Solution Explorer and open MainPage.xaml.cs. 3.	 Add the following private variable in the public partial class MainPage :   UserControl to hold a list of Ghost instances: private List  _ghosts;  4.	 Add the following lines of code after the line InitializeComponent  ; in the   constructor.  We must create the list and add the Ghost instances created through  the XAML code.

Replace the code in the event handler for the MouseMove event with the following   lines:    Get the mouse current position Point point = e.GetPosition cnvMovementTest ;    Define a starting point that will be used for each Ghost  instance Point startPoint = new Point 0,0 ;  for  int i = 0; i < _ghosts.Count  ; i++  {      Set the canvas Left property to the mouse X position and the       starting point's X value   _ghosts[i].SetValue Canvas.LeftProperty, point.X +                        startPoint.X ;      Set the canvas Top property to the mouse Y position and the       starting point's Y value   _ghosts[i].SetValue Canvas.TopProperty, point.Y + startPoint.Y ;      Change the ghost's angle   _ghosts[i].rotateGhost.Angle =   point.X +  i * 10   % 360 ;      Change the ghost's horizontal scale   _ghosts[i].scaleGhost.ScaleX = 1 +   point.X   500  % 2 ;      Change the ghost's vertical scale   _ghosts[i].scaleGhost.ScaleY = 1 +   point.X   500  % 2 ;      Change the ghost's opacity percentage   _ghosts[i].Opacity =   point.Y   100  % 1 ;      Increase the starting point X and Y values   startPoint.X += 50;   startPoint.Y += 50; }  6.	 Build and run the solution. The default web browser will appear showing eight   ghosts moving, scaling, rotating, and changing their opacity according to the mouse  pointer's position. The web browser will be using some GPU hardware acceleration,  but ghosts will become slightly pixelated as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 50 ]   Chapter 2  What just happened? Silverlight cached bitmaps of the ghosts in the GPU to perform the operations using some  hardware acceleration. Now, you know how to make some changes to an existing Silverlight  application to translate some work to the GPU.  We manipulated the eight instances of the Ghost class created in the XAML code, adding the  C code in the MainPage class. We added a private List to hold the eight instances. In  the Initialize method for this class, we created this list and then added each ghost using  the names we gave them in the XAML code.  Running loops faster One of the questions that might arise is why a for loop was used to iterate through the  instances instead of a foreach one.  Silverlight will trigger the code in the MouseMove event handler  Ghost_MouseMove   each time the mouse pointer's position changes. That could happen dozens of times in just  a single second. We must update all the Ghost instances contained in the list as fast as  possible because this code can run many times per second.  A foreach loop, like the one defined by the following line, is the easiest way to iterate  through the list:  foreach  Ghost oneghost in _ghosts   [ 51 ]   Working with 2D Characters  However, the problem is that the foreach loops are slower than the for loops that perform  exactly the same operations in the elements of a list. For this reason, it is convenient to use  the for loops instead of the foreach loops, especially when the code is going to run many  times per second. Hence, we used the following for loop to update the ghosts:  for  int i = 0; i < _ghosts.Count  ; i++   The code in the event is very simple. It interacts with the elements and the transformations  defined in the XAML code. It changes the values of some properties, taking into account a  relative starting position and the mouse pointer's current position.  Accelerating transforms and blends Once we have the mouse position, we will define a starting point that we will be using for  each Ghost instance found in the list. We will align the ghosts as in a domino game. The  startPoint local variable holds the relative X and Y values for each ghost, starting at   X = 0 and Y = 0:  Point startPoint = new Point 0,0 ;  Next, we do the following operations with each ghost by just changing some properties:          Translate the Canvas that contains the paths that create the ghost, taking  into account the mouse pointer's current position, and the value of the X and  Y coordinates of the starting point. We could achieve the same goal using a  TranslateTransform instance. Change the ghost's angle. In order to do this, we access the RotateTransform  instance named rotateGhost  created in the XAML code  and change the value   for its Angle property: _ghosts[i].rotateGhost.Angle =   point.X +  i * 10   % 360 ; Scale the ghost  width and height . We access the ScaleTransform instance  named scaleGhost  created in the XAML code  and change the values of its  ScaleX and ScaleY properties: _ghosts[i].scaleGhost.ScaleX = 1 +   point.X   500  % 2 ; _ghosts[i].scaleGhost.ScaleY = 1 +   point.X   500  % 2 ; Change the ghost's transparency level. We change the value of the Opacity  property  0…1 .  Once we complete a cycle, we increase the starting point's X and Y values to locate the   next ghost.  We used the modulus operator  %  many times to easily restrict the upper values and create  a repetitive effect while the mouse pointer was moving.  [ 52 ]   Chapter 2  The GPU helps the CPU to perform these operations. We made the necessary  changes to allow Silverlight to accelerate these operations through a specialized  hardware. However, this does not mean that all of the applications and games  will benefit from these kinds of configurations. As explained earlier, it depends  on the operations performed.  Using 2D vectors The startPoint local variable is of the Point type  System.Windows.Point . This  structure represents a 2D vector with two components, represented by two double   values—X  column  and Y  row . It is useful to define the position of UI elements on the  screen, or in the UI elements that define a viewport or a 2D space.  We created it by specifying the values for the X-coordinate  column  and the   Y-coordinate  row :  Point startPoint = new Point 0,0 ;  If we wanted the starting point to be at the pixel column number 100  X  and the pixel row  number 50  Y , we should replace it by the following line:  Point startPoint = new Point 100,50 ;  The first parameter is the X-coordinate value and the second is the Y-coordinate value.  The upper-left corner of a Canvas  one of the Layout panels available in Silverlight  begins at  X = 0 and Y = 0. Thus, it uses a simple numeric series beginning at 0 for both coordinates.  The following diagram illustrates the way the X-coordinate and the Y-coordinate values work  in both Silverlight and WPF to display UI elements in a Canvas or other Layout panels:  -  reduce   Y axis  -  reduce   +  increase   X axis  +  increase   [ 53 ]   Working with 2D Characters  The following list illustrates the changes in the coordinate values to move in a certain direction:          If we want to move right, we must increase the X-coordinate value If we want to move left, we must reduce the X-coordinate value If we want to move up, we must reduce the Y-coordinate value If we want to move down, we must increase the Y-coordinate value  Time for action – detecting GPU-acceleration problems You want to prepare the most exciting game using as much GPU acceleration as possible.  However, is the game going to take advantage of GPU acceleration in Silverlight 3? As  previously explained, that depends on the operations performed over the UI elements. If  you have any doubts, it is possible to change a parameter and check whether Silverlight is  sending the cache bitmap to the GPU for certain UI elements:  1.  Stay in the SilverlightMonster project. 2.  Open the ASPX code for SilverlightMonsterTestPage.aspx  double-click on it   in the Solution Explorer, found under the SilverlightMonster.Web project .  3.  Move to the section beginning with the following line of code: <object data="data:application x-silverlight-2,"  4.  Insert the following line of code after the line that begins with <param   name="source".  We are setting the EnableCacheVisualization boolean  parameter to true for the Silverlight plugin instance.     5.  Open the XAML code for Ghost.xaml 6.  Comment out the lines that assign the BitmapCache value to the CacheMode   property of the Canvas that contains the paths that define the vector-based  illustration: <!-- Disable cache mode           -->  Remember that enclosing the XAML code between   generates a  comment block, like  * and *  in the C code. Of course, the commented code  is not taken into account.  [ 54 ]   7.  Build and run the solution. Now, the eight ghosts will scale like real vector graphics.   However, they will be red in color and will move slower because Silverlight is  showing those UI elements that are not cached in red. Hence, none of the ghosts  are using GPU hardware acceleration, as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 2  What just happened? We changed the  EnableCacheVisualization parameter that caused the red color to  paint the UI elements that are not being cached by the GPU. Hence, these elements will not  benefit from specialized hardware acceleration.  We removed the assignment of the BitmapCache value to the CacheMode property of the  Canvas, which contains the paths that define the vector-based ghost. Thus, the GPU does  not use a bitmap snapshot as a source for performing hardware-accelerated transformations.  This means there is no bitmap cache to work with. Therefore, there is no GPU acceleration  and the ghosts use more CPU to render the transformations. However, the advantage is that  the scalable vector graphics do not became pixelated when scaled without this kind of GPU  acceleration offered by Silverlight 3. Thus, there is no CPU acceleration and the ghosts use  more CPU to render the transformations.  [ 55 ]   Working with 2D Characters  Understanding GPU acceleration limitations The GPU acceleration in Silverlight 3 is based on using a bitmap snapshot of the original  representation of a graphic  vector-based or raster . For this reason, when we need to scale  vector-based graphics using this GPU acceleration, it will generate pixelated graphics. This   is because it is scaling a bitmap snapshot of vector-based graphics using the GPU functions to  transform the bitmaps. It is not full GPU acceleration like the acceleration found in DirectX   or OpenGL.  Therefore, its usage will depend on the kind of game which we are making and the  capabilities of the computers that are running the Silverlight application.  We will have to measure the performance improvements, test the visual results, and then  decide. There is no silver bullet.  Creating encapsulated object-oriented characters  So far, we made some changes to take advantage of some of the power offered by modern  GPUs in Silverlight 3. We developed a very simple application showing eight ghosts doing  funny things on the screen, controlled by the mouse. However, there is no time to play! You  have to begin developing games for the competition. These games require images of aliens  moving from one side of the screen to the other without any mouse interaction. How can we  display, animate, and control an image in Silverlight?  Silverlight 3 provides excellent animation features. However, games require more precision  and coordination than individual animations. In our remakes, we will need to control  different characters with diverse behaviors. The best way to do this is by combining  encapsulated object-oriented characters with Silverlight-rendering capabilities. A good  object-oriented design will allow us to generalize some behaviors and create a simple yet  powerful gaming framework.  This is not a five-step task. Therefore, we will begin by working with some animation basics,  encapsulate the characters and generalize their behaviors in the game, and then add classes.  Time for action – creating User Control classes to hold images A sprite is a 2D image  a bitmap  that provides movement and animation capabilities, and is  integrated into a scene. A sprite represents a game character capable of moving through the  scene and interacting with other sprites. However, using Silverlight 3, we can also use vector- based illustrations as sprites for our games.  [ 56 ]   Chapter 2  First, we will transform some raster-based aliens to User Controls. Then, we will be able to  control their movements like sprites:  1.	 Create a new C project using the Silverlight Application template. Use   SilverlightInvaders2D as the project's name.  2.	 Create a new folder in SilverlightInvaders2D  the main project that will   generate the XAP output file . Rename it to images.  3.	 Right-click on the aforementioned folder and select Add  Existing item… from the   context menu that appears.  4.	 Go to the folder in which you saved the manipulated and resized raster images    C:\Silverlight3D\Invaders\GAME_PNGS_RESIZED . Select all the PNG  images and click on Add.  5.	 Repeat the following steps  6 to 8  for each raster graphic  a PNG file . 6.	 Add a new Silverlight User Control. A dialog box will appear asking for a name. Use  the names taking into account the following table for each new User Control, and  click on OK:  Image filename ALIEN_01_01.PNG ALIEN_02_01.PNG ALIEN_01_01.PNG SHIP_01_01.PNG TENT_01_01.PNG  User Control name BlueAlien RedAlien GreenAlien Ship Tent  7.	 Open the XAML code for a new User Control. Remove the assignments of the    Width and Height properties by erasing this code: Width="400" Height="300"  8.	 Replace the Grid definition with a Canvas and add an Image element to it.    The Source property has to include the relative path for the image to be shown.   We are going to use the name imgSprite01 for this image embedded in the  Canvas parent:          [ 57 ]   Working with 2D Characters  9.	 For each User Control created, the IDE is going to show the image with a transparent  background in the preview, as shown in the following screenshot for the RedAlien:  What just happened? We created a new User Control for each of the aliens, the tent, and the ship. These are  the characters of our raster game. Now, the project has a new XAML and a Class for each  potential sprite:            BlueAlien GreenAlien RedAlien Ship Tent  Now we have everything we need to begin moving these characters.  Time for action – displaying images and sprites First, we are going to display the raster images and give them life by transforming them into  our first sprites. We are going to add some code, which we will improve later:  1.	 Stay in the SilverlightInvaders2D project. 2.	 Open the XAML code for MainPage.xaml and replace the existing code with the  following.  You will see a button and the aliens aligned in five rows in the preview,   as shown in the screenshot after the code.  <UserControl x:Class="SilverlightInvaders2D.MainPage"   xmlns="http:  schemas.microsoft.com winfx 2006 xaml  [ 5 ]   Chapter 2           presentation"    xmlns:x="http:  schemas.microsoft.com winfx 2006 xaml"    Width="1366" Height="768"   xmlns:SilverlightInvaders2D=                             "clr-namespace:SilverlightInvaders2D">               <Button x:Name="btnStartGame"          Content="Start the game!"

Open MainPage.xaml.cs and add the following lines to define the private   variables in public partial class MainPage : UserControl:    Holds the green alien's location in the Canvas private Point _GreenAlien1Location = new Point 0, 0 ;    Holds the speed for X and Y movement private Point _GreenAlien1Speed = new Point 250, 0 ;    The upper left corner for the animation private Point _UpperLeftCorner = new Point 0, 0 ;    The bottom right corner for the animation private Point _BottomRightCorner = new Point 0, 0 ;    The aliens' row height private double _RowHeight = 60;    Holds the time when the method finished rendering a frame private DateTime _LastTick;  4.	 Add the following lines of code to program the event handler that will render each   frame and update the sprite's position: private void RenderFrame object sender, EventArgs e  {      Hold the elapsed time after the last call to this method   TimeSpan ElapsedTime =  DateTime.Now - _LastTick ;      Update the X-coordinate according to the elapsed time and the    speed   _GreenAlien1Location.X += _GreenAlien1Speed.X *                              double ElapsedTime.TotalSeconds;      Update the Y-coordinate according to the elapsed time and the    speed   _GreenAlien1Location.Y += _GreenAlien1Speed.Y *                               double ElapsedTime.TotalSeconds;   if  _GreenAlien1Location.X > _BottomRightCorner.X    {        Right bound reached, invert direction     _GreenAlien1Speed.X *= -1;     _GreenAlien1Location.X = _BottomRightCorner.X;        Advance one row     _GreenAlien1Location.Y += _RowHeight;   }   else if  _GreenAlien1Location.X < _UpperLeftCorner.X    {        Left bound reached, invert direction  [ 60 ]   Chapter 2      _GreenAlien1Speed.X *= -1;     _GreenAlien1Location.X = _UpperLeftCorner.X;        Advance one row     _GreenAlien1Location.Y += _RowHeight;   }      Set the new location for the sprite   ucGreenAlien1.SetValue Canvas.LeftProperty,                           _GreenAlien1Location.X ;   ucGreenAlien1.SetValue Canvas.TopProperty, _GreenAlien1Location. Y ;      Save the current time   _LastTick = DateTime.Now; }  5.	 Finally, add the following lines of code to program the event handler for the button's   Click event.  This code will start animating the sprite.  private void btnStartGame_Click object sender, RoutedEventArgs e  {      Hide the button   btnStartGame.Visibility = Visibility.Collapsed;      Store the green alien's current location   _GreenAlien1Location = new    Point  double ucGreenAlien1.GetValue Canvas.LeftProperty ,          double ucGreenAlien1.GetValue Canvas.TopProperty  ;      Define the upper left corner and bottom right corner for the       animation   _UpperLeftCorner = new Point _GreenAlien1Location.X,                                 _GreenAlien1Location.Y ;   _BottomRightCorner = new Point LayoutRoot.ActualWidth -                         ucGreenAlien1.imgSprite01.ActualWidth,                        LayoutRoot.ActualHeight -                         ucGreenAlien1.imgSprite01.ActualHeight ;      Save the current time   _LastTick = DateTime.Now;      Add an EventHandler   CompositionTarget.Rendering += RenderFrame; }  [ 61 ]   Working with 2D Characters  6.	 Build and run the solution. Click on the button and the green alien  the sprite  will  move from the left to right, down a row, right to left, down a row, left to right, and  so on as shown in the following screenshot:  What just happened? You have the first sprite moving in a Silverlight 3 application! The sprite does not have a nice  animation. It just moves on the screen, as the invaders have to move in the game. The alien  moves from the upper-left corner to the bottom-right corner with a certain speed and takes  into account the time elapsed between each frame rendering.  This is very important in games because they are going to run on computers with different  amounts of processing power. The movement should take nearly the same time on all of the  target machines for the game.  Showing a sprite on the screen First we created the instances for the User Controls intended to be sprites using the XAML  code. For example, the green alien sprite was created with the name ucGreenAlien1 using  the following line:  <SilverlightInvaders2D:GreenAlien x:Name="ucGreenAlien1"                                   Canvas.Left="50" Canvas.Top="10" >  [ 62 ]   Chapter 2  Initially, the sprite is visible in the Canvas at the position X = 50; Y = 10, which includes the  upper-left corner of its own Canvas.  We could have animated the sprite using Silverlight 3 animation facilities. However, we need  a lot of precision in games and we must keep a control on certain important issues. One of  the most important issues is time management.  By default, Silverlight 3 renders 60 frames per second. This means that it will redraw   changes in the rendered content 60 times per second whenever possible. The code executed  in each render call must be as fast as possible to avoid skipping frames and to create a  smooth animation.  We used the MainPage class to include many private variables to help us  develop precise time-management features and a nice sprite movement.  However, we will have to refactor this code to create specialized classes as a  part of our gaming framework. We need a simple way to create sprites without  having to add dozens of new variables for each new sprite. Nevertheless, we  must understand how things work before generalizing different behaviors using  the C object-oriented capabilities.  We wanted the sprite to move in the Canvas as shown in the following screenshot:  Defining the behavior We defined a Point variable used as a 2D vector that holds the speed for this sprite's X-axis  and Y-axis:  private Point _GreenAlien1Speed = new Point 250, 0 ;  [ 63 ]   Working with 2D Characters  The resultant actions for various values that a speed can take are listed here:          A positive speed for the X-axis advances from left to right A negative speed for the X-axis goes from right to left A positive speed for the Y-axis goes from top to bottom A negative speed for the Y-axis goes from bottom to top  Combining both speeds, we can make a sprite move both horizontally and vertically on   the screen.  If we want to change the speed of this sprite, we just have to replace the aforementioned  line or change the value of the X and Y properties of the Point structure that defines the  speed. When the code that renders the sprite is next ran, it will automatically use the new  speed values.  When we change the sign of the speed, we are changing the sprite's direction.  We use the elapsed time, measured in seconds  with milliseconds precision , between each  frame that has to be rendered in order to calculate the new position for the sprite. A formula  based on the speed and the time elapsed offers good precision, and also allows us to have  exhaustive control over the animation parameters.  Once the time span between the last time the CompositionTarget.Rendering event  handler  the RenderFrame method  was called and the current time is calculated, we can  update the X and Y coordinates for the sprite using the following lines:  TimeSpan ElapsedTime =  DateTime.Now - _LastTick ; _GreenAlien1Location.X += _GreenAlien1Speed.X *                             double ElapsedTime.TotalSeconds; _GreenAlien1Location.Y += _GreenAlien1Speed.Y *                             double ElapsedTime.TotalSeconds;  We are not performing an animation of the Y-axis based on the speed in our example.  However, it is included in the code to allow further experimentation with changing the  speed. Remember that you have to find the most accurate speed for the Invader game.  An animation controlled by speed and direction is more difficult to code for the first time.  However, it is very flexible and will allow us to control dozens of sprites moving at the same  time with a small amount of code.  [ 64 ]   Chapter 2  Understanding dimensions When we click on the button, the code programmed in its event handler initializes certain  variables related to the dimensions.  First, it stores the sprite's initial location in the _GreenAlien1Location Point  a 2D  vector . It does this by calling the GetValue method to obtain both the Left and Top  properties for the Canvas that contains the sprite image:  _GreenAlien1Location = new Point  double ucGreenAlien1.                                 GetValue Canvas.LeftProperty ,                                  double ucGreenAlien1.                                 GetValue Canvas.TopProperty  ;  We must typecast to double because the point needs two double values  for the X and   Y coordinates .  Once we saved the initial location in an instance variable, we have to calculate the  boundaries of the viewport in which the sprite is going to move.  The upper-left corner is defined by its initial location because it is using the same values as  the Canvas Left and Top properties:  _UpperLeftCorner = new Point _GreenAlien1Location.X,                               _GreenAlien1Location.Y ;  The bottom-right corner takes into account the actual width of the main Canvas   LayoutRoot  and the actual width of the image contained in the User Control. We use the  image because we created a Canvas with no size for the User Controls that define the sprites.  The image contains the actual size, which is as follows:  _BottomRightCorner = new Point LayoutRoot.ActualWidth -                               ucGreenAlien1.imgSprite01.ActualWidth,                              LayoutRoot.ActualHeight -                               ucGreenAlien1.imgSprite01.ActualHeight ;  Now, the code saves the current time for the first time and adds the event handler to  CompositionTarget.Rendering:  _LastTick = DateTime.Now; CompositionTarget.Rendering += RenderFrame;  We can end the animation at any time, thus detaching the event handler:  CompositionTarget.Rendering -= RenderFrame;  [ 65 ]   Working with 2D Characters  Managing resolutions One of the most important issues related to game development is understanding the screen  and its resolutions.  We defined a resolution of a 1366X768 pixel Canvas. The User Controls that define the  potential sprites are the children of this Canvas  LayoutRoot , as explained in the document  outline shown in the following screenshot:  In order to display the document outline for an XAML file, select View   Other Windows  Document Outline from the main menu.  Thus, the sprites have to move inside this Canvas. The code programmed in the event  handler to render each frame considers this. Once it has calculated the new positions for  the X and Y coordinates, it checks if the values are inside the movement viewport. We  calculated the viewport dimensions outside the code, which runs each time a frame has to  be rendered, because we want this code to be as simple and fast as possible. Hence, we just  had to compare values using a few simple if blocks:  if  _GreenAlien1Location.X > _BottomRightCorner.X  {   _GreenAlien1Speed.X *= -1;   _GreenAlien1Location.X = _BottomRightCorner.X;   _GreenAlien1Location.Y += _RowHeight; } else if  _GreenAlien1Location.X < _UpperLeftCorner.X   [ 66 ]   Chapter 2  {   _GreenAlien1Speed.X *= -1;   _GreenAlien1Location.X = _UpperLeftCorner.X;   _GreenAlien1Location.Y += _RowHeight; }  If the new location  still not rendered to the screen  is outside the boundaries, we do   the following:        Invert the direction of the X-axis movement Assign a new appropriate value to the X-coordinate Advance the amount of pixels specified by the _RowHeight variable in   the Y-coordinate  These techniques work in any desired resolution for a game.  As we can see, using a time-based animation programmed in a frame-based rendering event  handler allows us to control a sprite with a few lines of code. Of course, this can be improved  and refactored to simplify future developments.  We are taking into account the current time. Hence, the sprites will run pretty similarly  in most modern computers and in any resolution, provided they can handle a minimum  acceptable processing demand.  Screen resolutions The following table summarizes the most common modern screen resolutions and their  standard names. We must consider them when developing games that will run in a   web browser:  Name VGA NTSC PAL SVGA WVGA XGA HD720  720i  and 720p   Horizontal pixels 640 720 768 800 854 1024  Vertical pixels 480 480 576 600 480 768  Aspect ratio 4:3 3:2 4:3 4:3 16:9 4:3  1280  720  16:9  [ 67 ]   Working with 2D Characters  Name SXGA WXGA SXGA+ WXGA+   WSXGA  UXGA WSXGA+ HD1080  1080i  and 1080p  WUXGA QXGA WQXGA QSXGA  1440  1600 1680  1920  1920 2048 2560 2560  Horizontal pixels 1280 1366 1400  Vertical pixels 1024 768 1050  Aspect ratio 5:4 16:9 4:3  900  1200 1050  1080  1200 1536 1600 2048  16:10  4:3 16:10  16:9  16:10 4:3 16:10 5:4  Have a go hero – completing the animation You receive an RSS feed update from the game contest. To participate in the contest, they are  requesting a Silverlight 3 application that shows some preview animation for the games.  Do not worry! Using the animation techniques learned so far, you could animate multiple  sprites, all the monsters, the tents, and the ship at the same time.  Prepare the complete animation for the raster game we have been working on in   this chapter.  Also, create another application using all the vector-based graphics. Using nearly the same  steps from our previous example, you can animate sprites using vector graphics instead of  raster images.  If you feel the code is not easy to maintain when you have to work with many sprites, you  are right. Refactor the code that is wrapping the sprites using a new class to define the most  common animation behavior for this game.  Pop quiz – working with sprites and the GPU  1.

Program code in the CompositionTarget.Rendering event handler   to manage the animation  Summary  We learned a lot in this chapter about GPU hardware acceleration, 2D vectors, resolutions,  sprites, and animation. Specifically, we made some configurations to take advantage of the  Silverlight 3D GPU-acceleration capabilities. We used the digital art assets to create sprites  and to develop a precise animation rendering process. We understood the advantages and  trade-offs related to hardware-accelerated operations in Silverlight 3.  Now that we've learned about the principles of 2D sprites and time-based animation  combined with frame-based rendering, we're ready to combine multiple sprites with nice  backgrounds, which is the topic of the next chapter.  [ 6 ]    3  Combining Sprites with Backgrounds  In order to provide good feedback to the players, we must animate many  independent sprites at the same time, while responding to the players controls.  This seems to be a very complex task, involving a lot of code. However, using a  good object-oriented design, combined with Silverlight 3's capabilities, we can  transform complex game loops into easy-to-understand code.  In this chapter, we will control multiple sprites created on demand. By reading it and  following the exercises you will learn how to:            Take advantage of object-oriented programming to work with multiple sprites Prepare easy-to-understand and well-organized game loops Create objects on the fly, as needed by the game logic Control transformations applied to vector-based graphics Understand the basics of collision detection algorithms  The first remake assignment  So far, we showed a few raster sprites, and created a simple 2D scene with some animations.  We also took advantage of some GPU acceleration and used 2D vectors to define locations  and movements. However, games require dozens of sprites moving at different speeds and  directions. How can we animate multiple independent concurrent sprites while managing a  complex game loop?  We can do this by combining a good object-oriented design with the power of XAML based  vector graphics. Using the same principles that we learnt for raster sprites, it is possible to  create more flexible vector-based sprites.   Combining Sprites with Backgrounds  The key to success is using smart object-oriented characters and a flexible  game loop. We must understand what we are doing in order to create  efficient algorithms for our games.  Time for action – creating sprites based on XAML  vector-based graphics You receive an e-mail from the game contest. They loved the vector-based graphics used in  your preview. Now, they want you to send them a more complete prototype for this remake.  They want more action. If they like your game, they will hire you to create 3D games using  Silverlight 3 and a powerful 3D engine.  First, we are going to transform all the XAML vector-based graphics to User Controls. Then,  we will create many object-oriented classes using inheritance, a very powerful capability  that simplifies code re-use. In this case, we are not going to define instances using XAML,   we will create them with the C code:  1.	 Create a new C project using the Silverlight Application template. Use    SilverlightInvaders2DVector as the project's name.  2.	 Make the necessary changes to the configuration files to enable GPU acceleration.    We learned the steps to do it in the previous chapter.  3.	 Go to the folder in which you saved the scalable vector graphics for the game in    XAML format  C:\Silverlight3D\Invaders\GAME_XAML .  4.	 Repeat the following steps  5 to 17  for each of the vector-based graphic  XAML file . 5.	 Add a new Silverlight User Control. A dialog box will appear asking for a name.    Use the names from the following table for each new User Control and click on OK:  XAML file name ALIEN_01_01.XAML ALIEN_02_01.XAML ALIEN_03_01.XAML SHIP_01_01.XAML TENT_01_01.XAML  User Control name BlueAlien RedAlien GreenAlien Ship Tent  Open the XAML code for the new User Control. Make the changes explained in  the previous chapter to create the Ghost UserControl  replace the Grid with  a Canvas, rename it to LayerRoot and assign the value BitmapCache to the  CacheMode property of the Canvas .  [ 72 ]   Chapter 3  6.	 Now, replace Background="{x:Null}" with Background="White" in the line    that defines the main Canvas. Add values for Width and Height to change   the Canvas's size. The white background will help you to find the exact values   for each character.  7.	 Once you find the correct values for Width and Height, replace   Background="White" with Background="{x:Null}". We  do not want a white rectangle behind the characters.  8.	 Add the following code to the line that defines the main Canvas  we have to set   the render transform relative to the center of the bounds of the Canvas—50% of   total width and 50% of total height : RenderTransformOrigin="0.5,0.5"  9.	 The complete line should be similar than this one:  <Canvas x:Name="LayoutRoot" Background="{x:Null}" Width="195"         Height="128" RenderTransformOrigin="0.5,0.5">  10.	 Open the XAML in Expression Blend  right-click on it in the Solution Explorer and    select Open in Expression Blend .  11.	 Click on the main Canvas named LayoutRoot under Objects and Timeline and    go to its Properties tab.  12.	 Expand Transform and activate the Center Point tab. Click on Relative and   enter 0.5 in both X and Y textboxes. The RenderTransformOrigin property,  under Miscellaneous will show the value 0.5,0.5, and the center point will  appear in the middle of the main Canvas, as shown in the following screenshot   a small circle appears behind the mouse pointer with four arrows :  [ 73 ]   Combining Sprites with Backgrounds  13.	 Expand Transform and select the Scale tab. Click on Relative and enter 0.5 in    both X and Y textboxes. In this case, we have to reduce the size for sprites. However,   we can change the scale later for bigger resolutions.  14.	 Go back to the XAML code and you will see a Canvas.RenderTransform    and a TransformGroup. Expression Blend created them. Give the name   "rotateSprite" to the RotateTransform. The line that defines the rotate   transformation will be this:    15.	 Leave the same values generated by Expression Blend for the X and Y properties of    the TranslateTransform definition.  16.	 For each User Control created, the IDE is going to show the image with a    transparent background in the preview, as shown in the following screenshot   of the GreenAlien:  What just happened? We created a new User Control for each vector graphics that represent a character in our  game. Now, the project has a new XAML code and a Class for each potential sprite.  However, in this case, we did not add a reference to an image. We created a complex XAML  vector graphic with some parameters to simplify future animation tasks.  [ 74 ]   Chapter 3  Defining the relative center point One of the questions that might arise is why specific widths and heights were introduced for  each XAML Canvas?  We want to keep things simple in order to learn many important 2D techniques that will help  us in our main goal—3D games development. The automatic sizing features in Silverlight are  a bit complex when working with XAML vector graphics. We do not want to begin working  with delegates and asynchronous code to obtain the rendered Width and Height for each  sprite. Therefore, we defined it using XAML so that we will be able to work with precise  widths and heights for each graphic that has to be shown.  We used Expression Blend to create a group of transformations that will allow us to rotate  each alien around its center point. This center point is defined by considering the width and  height of the main Canvas:  <Canvas x:Name="LayoutRoot" Background="{x:Null}" Width="205"         Height="110" RenderTransformOrigin="0.5,0.5">  This line means that the center point  origin  for the render transformations is 0.5 * actual  width and 0.5 * actual height, as shown in the following diagram:  Thus, we are able to rotate the graphic around its center point, as shown in the previous  picture. We used the name "rotateSprite" for the rotate transformation. Initially, its  angle is 0, but we are going to access it by its name and change the angle using the C code.  [ 75 ]   Combining Sprites with Backgrounds  If we did not define the relative center point for the transformations, the alien  would rotate from the default center point  X = 0, Y = 0 —the main Canvas's  upper left corner.  The first lines of XAML code that define the Canvas for one of the aliens are the following:  <Canvas x:Name="LayoutRoot" Background="{x:Null}" Width="205"         Height="110" RenderTransformOrigin="0.5,0.5">                                                                    Time for action – creating a specialized sprite  management class We now have the User Controls defined. We need to move many sprites based on these User  Controls. Now, we are going to create a generalized superclass to manage the most common  operations related to a User Control working as a sprite.  1.	 Stay in the SilverlightInvaders2DVector project 2.	 Create a new abstract class—UpdateableUIElement 3.	 Add the following public property to determine whether   the user interface element is alive or not: public bool isAlive { set; get; }  4.	 Add the following public abstract method to encapsulate   updates based on the elapsed time: public abstract void Update TimeSpan elapsedTime ;  5.	 Create a new abstract class—SpriteWrapper  a subclass of UpdateableUIElement    —using the following declaration: public abstract class SpriteWrapper: UpdateableUIElement  [ 76 ]   Chapter 3  6.	 Add the following protected variables:     Indicates whether the sprite has been rendered or not protected bool _rendered = false;    The UserControl instance associated to this SpriteWrapper protected UserControl _ucSpriteUC;    The parent Canvas protected Canvas _cnvParent;  7.	 Add the following protected variables and their properties to access them:     The location protected Point _location; public Point location  {    set { _location = value; }   get { return _location; } }    The speed protected Point _speed; public Point speed {   set { _speed = value; }   get { return _speed; } }    The rendered size protected Size _size; public Size size {   get   {     if  !_rendered        return new Size  ;     else       return _size;    } }  [ 77 ]  8.	 Add the following public abstract method to create the UserControl instance  associated to the SpriteWrapper instance  the key to the factory method pattern  public abstract UserControl CreateSpriteUC  ;   Combining Sprites with Backgrounds  9.	 Add the following constructor with two parameters—the parent Canvas    and the initial sprite's location on it: public SpriteWrapper Canvas cnvParent, Point initialLocation  {   _cnvParent = cnvParent;   _ucSpriteUC = CreateSpriteUC  ;   _location = initialLocation;      Initially, the sprite is static   _speed = new Point 0, 0 ;   cnvParent.Children.Add _ucSpriteUC ;      Set the initial position for the sprite   _ucSpriteUC.SetValue Canvas.LeftProperty, _location.X ;   _ucSpriteUC.SetValue Canvas.TopProperty, _location.Y ;      By default, it is alive   isAlive = true; }  10.	 Add the following public method to calculate the sprite's position taking into    account its initial location, its speed settings, and the elapsed time: public void CalculateNewPosition TimeSpan elapsedTime  {      Update the X-coordinate according to the elapsed time and the       speed   _location.X += _speed.X *  double elapsedTime.TotalSeconds;      Update the Y-coordinate according to the elapsed time and the       speed   _location.Y += _speed.Y *  double elapsedTime.TotalSeconds; }  11.	 Add the following public method to calculate the sprite's actual size once    it has been rendered for the first time: public virtual void CalculateSize   {   _size = new Size  double _ucSpriteUC.GetValue            Canvas.ActualWidthProperty  * 0.5,             double _ucSpriteUC.GetValue            Canvas.ActualHeightProperty  * 0.5 ; }  [ 7 ]   12.	 Add the following public methods to simplify the process of inverting the sprite's    Chapter 3  directions without changing the actual speed: public void InvertXDirection   {   _speed.X *= -1; } public void InvertYDirection   {   _speed.Y *= -1; }  13.	 Override the Update method to update the sprite's position taking into account its    initial location, its speed settings and the elapsed time:  public override void Update TimeSpan elapsedTime  {   if  !isAlive      return;   if  !_rendered    {        First time rendered, save the actual size     CalculateSize  ;        Flag the sprite as rendered     _rendered = true;   }   CalculateNewPosition elapsedTime ;      Set the new location for the sprite   _ucSpriteUC.SetValue Canvas.LeftProperty, _location.X ;   _ucSpriteUC.SetValue Canvas.TopProperty, _location.Y ; }  What just happened? The code to define an independent sprite is now held in the new SpriteWrapper class    a subclass of UpdateableUIElement . As it is an abstract class, we will have to create  new subclasses inheriting from SpriteWrapper to specialize the behavior of our characters.  Now, the most common operations to display a sprite based on a UserControl instance  and move it in a Canvas are encapsulated in methods in this class. The instances of the  SpriteWrapper's subclasses will be real independent sprites capable of defining the most  complex behavior taking advantage of the skeleton defined by this superclass.  [ 7 ]   Combining Sprites with Backgrounds  Every character with a particular behavior can have its own subclass. Therefore, we can  create new classes to manage the characters according to our needs. For example, if an alien  needs a rotation speed, we must add a new property or instance variable and override the  necessary methods to rotate the alien while it moves.  It is easier to manage multiple independent sprites using skeletons like this.  The CalculateSize method multiplies the actual size by the same scale transformations  used  0.5 . We do this in order to keep things simple and to avoid losing the focus. However,  of course, this is not a very nice way to do this. It is useful for this example:  _size = new          Size  double _ucSpriteUC.GetValue Canvas.ActualWidthProperty          * 0.5, double _ucSpriteUC.GetValue          Canvas.ActualHeightProperty  * 0.5 ;  Taking full advantage of object-oriented capabilities One of the main problems that arises when generalizing a common behavior is that the  generalized code to coordinate a UserControl must create instances of the specific  subclasses that represent the UserControl. For example, the alien manager needs to create  an instance of BlueAlien  a subclass of UserControl created mostly through XAML .  Using the concepts introduced by the factory method class creational pattern, we can solve  this problem with great simplicity. The constructor calls the CreateSpriteUC abstract  method to assign the UserControl to the protected _ucSpriteUC variable, as shown   in the following line of code:  _ucSpriteUC = CreateSpriteUC  ;  The creation is encapsulated in this method, which is an abstract method and forces  subclasses to override it:  public abstract UserControl CreateSpriteUC  ;  It returns a new UserControl instance. Overriding this method, we can return instances   of any subclass of UserControl. Thus, we let the SpriteWrapper subclasses decide which  class to instantiate.  This is the principle of the factory method design pattern. It lets a class defer  instantiation to subclasses. Hence, each new implementation of a sprite will  have its new SpriteWrapper and UserControl subclasses.  [ 0 ]   Chapter 3  Preparing the classes for inheritance Apart from implementing a variation of the factory method design pattern, we had to  prepare the SpriteWrapper class for inheritance. We must override methods in order   to create specialized classes.  We must override the following methods in a SpriteWrapper subclass capable of   creating instances:        The constructor; This is used to call the base constructor and append any additional  initialization code that is needed. Remember that constructors do not require the  virtual keyword. CreateSpriteUC: This is used to return a new instance of a specific   UserControl subclass. Update: This is used to render each frame taking into account the elapsed time.   It is necessary to add additional code when the sprite represented by the subclass  adds new behaviors.  In order to simplify game development, it is very important to master  inheritance and design patterns as well as many other object-oriented  code reuse techniques. Simpler code is easier to understand and to  maintain. C is a very powerful language and you can use that power to  simplify games development.  Wrapping a UserControl to manage it One of the questions that might arise is why a sprite wrapper was used to manage a  UserControl instead of creating an interface. The answer is simple, to keep things simple,  and to take advantage of visual development tools.  Each UserControl has XAML code and C code. However, if we take a look at the C code  created automatically by the IDE  the .xaml.cs file , we will see a public partial class  definition, like this one:  public partial class BlueAlien : UserControl  We cannot add an interface or change the superclass for this UserControl subclass,  because the other part of the code is automatically generated from XAML, and it resides  in a file that we cannot modify  the .xaml.g.cs file . We have access to one part of the  complete class that inherits from UserControl. For this reason, we cannot add an interface  or change its superclass.  [ 1 ]   Combining Sprites with Backgrounds  Thus, the simplest way to manage a sprite defined in a UserControl is to use a wrapper  class. That is exactly what we are doing. The easiest way to understand how this works is to  use it.  We can use many other mechanisms in order to achieve the same goal. For  example, we could create a lookless control, also known as Custom Control,  inheriting from the Control class  System.Windows.Controls .  Then, we could create a ControlTemplate to define its appearance.  Time for action – creating a superclass for some characters Now, we are going to create specialized subclasses of SpriteWrapper for each character in  our game. As we have three different aliens in the game, we will create an AlienWrapper  class, to group the common behavior of the aliens, and then three subclasses to take full  advantage of object-oriented capabilities.  1.	 Stay in the SilverlightInvaders2DVector project. 2.	 Create a new abstract class—AlienWrapper  a subclass of SpriteWrapper    —using the following declaration: public abstract class AlienWrapper : SpriteWrapper  3.	 Add the following protected variables  the aliens have to rotate at a    certain speed :    The current rotation angle protected double _angle;    The rotation speed protected double _rotationSpeed;  4.	 Add the following property:  public double rotationSpeed {   set { _rotationSpeed = value; }   get { return _rotationSpeed; } }  [ 2 ]   Chapter 3  5.	 Add the following constructor that calls the base constructor:  public AlienWrapper Canvas cnvParent, Point initialLocation    : base cnvParent, initialLocation  {      Add any necessary additional instructions      The default speed for X = 50   _speed = new Point 50, 0 ;      The default rotation speed = 0   _rotationSpeed = 0;   _angle = 0; }  6.	 Add the following public method to calculate the sprite's rotation angle, taking into    account its rotation speed setting and the elapsed time: public void CalculateNewAngle TimeSpan elapsedTime  {      Update the angle according to the elapsed time and the speed   if  _rendered      _angle =   _angle +_rotationSpeed *                  double elapsedTime.TotalSeconds  % 360 ; }  7.	 Add the following public method to simplify the process of inverting the sprite's    rotation speed without changing the actual speed:  public void InvertRotationSpeed   {   _rotationSpeed *= -1; }  What just happened? The code to define the common behavior for the aliens is now held in the new  AlienWrapper class  a subclass of SpriteWrapper . As it is an abstract class, we   will have to create new subclasses inheriting from AlienWrapper to specialize the   behavior of each alien.  The class adds variables, properties, and methods to handle the rotation of the sprite, taking  into account the sprite's rotation speed and the elapsed time.  [ 3 ]   Combining Sprites with Backgrounds  Time for action – creating the subclasses for the characters Now, we are going to create specialized subclasses for each character. Some of them are  subclasses of SpriteWrapper and others of AlienWrapper. The steps to create each  subclass of AlienWrapper are very similar. However, we will discuss how to refactor the  code later. This is our first intent to generalize many behaviors.  1.	 Stay in the SilverlightInvaders2DVector project. 2.	 Create a new class—BlueAlienWrapper  a subclass of AlienWrapper —using    the following declaration: public class BlueAlienWrapper : AlienWrapper  3.

Override the CreateSpriteUC method to create an instance of the    GreenAlien class: public override UserControl CreateSpriteUC   {   return new GreenAlien  ; }  13.	 Override the Update method to call the base method and then calculate the new    angle and update the rotate transformation parameter: public override void Update TimeSpan elapsedTime  {   base.Update elapsedTime ;   CalculateNewAngle elapsedTime ;    _ucSpriteUC as GreenAlien .rotateSprite.Angle = _angle; }  14.	 Create a new class, ShipWrapper  a subclass of SpriteWrapper  using the    following declaration: public class ShipWrapper : SpriteWrapper  15.

Add the following constructor that calls the base constructor, and leaves a space    to fill in the gaps if additional initialization code is needed: public ShipWrapper Canvas cnvParent, Point initialLocation                           : base cnvParent, initialLocation  {      Add any necessary additional instructions }  17.	 Override the CreateSpriteUC method to create an instance of the Ship class:  public override UserControl CreateSpriteUC   {   return new Ship  ; }  [ 6 ]   18.	 Add the following public methods to simplify the process of moving the sprite:  Chapter 3  public void GoUp   {   _speed.Y = -_incrementY;   _speed.X = 0; } public void GoDown   {   _speed.Y = _incrementY;   _speed.X = 0; } public void GoLeft   {   _speed.X = -_incrementX;   _speed.Y = 0; } public void GoRight   {   _speed.X = _incrementX;   _speed.Y = 0; }  19.

In these versions, you can right-click on the project's name  in the Solution Explorer and then click on View Class Diagram. This way, you  can create a visual diagram of the classes that compose a project, as the one  previously shown.  We have overridden the CreateSpriteUC method to associate each instantiable   subclass with a specific UserControl. When we create an instance of any of the previously  mentioned classes, there will be a new instance of a UserControl created and assigned to  the _ucSpriteUC protected variable. Hence, the code in the sprite wrappers has access to  the UserControl instance to perform transformations and any other necessary operations.  The three aliens have a rotation speed and rotate taking into account the elapsed time.   They also have different speed values.

Add the following method to create the sprites for the tents:  private void CreateTents   {   _tents = new List  _totalTents ;   for  int i = 0; i < _totalTents; i++    {     _tents.Add new TentWrapper LayoutRoot,                                 new Point 250 * i, 600   ;   } }  5.

Add the following method to translate the aliens down one row and invert    their direction: private void GoDownOneRow   {      Bound reached, invert direction   for  int i = 0; i < _aliens.Count; i++    {     if  _aliens[i].isAlive      {       _aliens[i].InvertXDirection  ;       _aliens[i].InvertRotationSpeed  ;          Advance one row       _aliens[i].location = new Point _aliens[i].location.X,        _aliens[i].location.Y + _rowHeight ;     }   } }  7.	 Add the following methods to check the bounds for the aliens' animation:  private void CheckLeftBound   {      If any alien touches the left bound, go down and invert       direction   for  int i = 0; i < _aliens.Count; i++    {  [ 1 ]   Combining Sprites with Backgrounds      if  _aliens[i].isAlive      {       if  _aliens[i].location.X <  _upperLeftCorner.X + 1         {            Left bound reached         GoDownOneRow  ;         _lastTouchRight = false;         break;       }     }   } } private void CheckRightBound   {      If any alien touches the right bound, go down and invert       direction   for  int i = 0; i < _aliens.Count; i++    {     if  _aliens[i].isAlive      {       if  _aliens[i].location.X >  _bottomRightCorner.X -            _colWidth         {            Right bound reached         GoDownOneRow  ;         _lastTouchRight = true;         break;       }     }   } } private void CheckBounds   {   if  _lastTouchRight      CheckLeftBound  ;   else     CheckRightBound  ; }  What just happened? We are going to create a complex game loop. Therefore, it is very important to use methods  in order to make the code easy to read, understand, modify, and re-use.  We did not create a new class to handle the game. We want to keep things simple because  we have added many classes to work with the sprites.  [ 2 ]   Creating objects on the fly The subclasses of SpriteWrapper allow us to create sprites on the fly—as needed. Thus,  we do not have to create the sprites in XAML code as we did in the previous raster version   of the game.  Chapter 3  The ability to create new sprites at any moment in the game is  very important. We can do this by creating new instances of the  SpriteWrapper subclasses, which generate new UserControl  instances and render them when necessary.  For example, the CreateAliens method creates 55 aliens organized in five rows and  eleven columns. However, the creation process is a bit complex. We have three subclasses  of AlienWrapper. The first row uses instances of GreenAlienWrapper. The second and  the third rows use instances of BlueAlienWrapper. Finally, the fourth and fifth rows use  instances of RedAlienWrapper. Nevertheless, as they are all instances of AlienWrapper,  we use a list of this superclass to store them.  This is the list of aliens:  private List  _aliens;  Saving each instance to this list allows us to control the aliens iterating through this list. The  numbers of row and column are used to calculate a initial position for each alien:  position = new Point  col * _colWidth ,  row * _rowHeight  ;  Then, each alien is created and added to the list using this position:  alien = new GreenAlienWrapper LayoutRoot, position ;  Mastering the use of lists, arrays, and collections is a must when developing  complex 2D and 3D games.  Managing dynamic objects In this case, we are working with 55 aliens. However, by changing two simple values,   _totalRows and _totalCols, we can change the number of sprites created. When  working with games, we have to create code capable of managing dynamic objects.  For example, we can have the following situation:        Stage 1: 55 aliens  5 rows and 11 columns  Stage 2: 66 aliens  6 rows and 11 columns  Stage 3: 72 aliens  6 rows and 12 columns   [ 3 ]   Combining Sprites with Backgrounds  We do not want to write too much new code for each additional stage. We want to be able  to handle many dynamic objects, created on the fly, as needed.  It is very easy to work with dynamic objects using lists and taking advantage of   object-oriented capabilities like inheritance and polymorphism—also known as dynamic  inheritance. For example, the GoDownOneRow method inverts the movement direction and  the rotation speed of all the aliens and makes them advance one row. However, it does this  after checking whether the sprite is alive or not  the bool value of the isAlive property :  for  int i = 0; i < _aliens.Count; i++  {   if  _aliens[i].isAlive    {     _aliens[i].InvertXDirection  ;     _aliens[i].InvertRotationSpeed  ;     _aliens[i].location = new Point _aliens[i].location.X,      _aliens[i].location.Y + _rowHeight ;   } }  We defined the methods InvertXDirection and InvertRotationSpeed in the  AlienWrapper superclass. Therefore, the three alien specific sprite wrappers have these  methods. We have to consider these situations when designing the classes for the game.  Time for action – writing the game loop It is time to write the code for the main game loop. We have to show the characters, make  them move and control the ship movement according to the keys pressed by the player.  1.	 Stay in the SilverlightInvaders2DVector project. 2.	 Open the XAML code for MainPage.xaml and replace the existing code with the    following  you will see a button with the title Start the game : <UserControl x:Class="SilverlightInvaders2DVector.MainPage"   xmlns="http:  schemas.microsoft.com winfx 2006 xaml                                          presentation"    xmlns:x="http:  schemas.microsoft.com winfx 2006 xaml"    Width="1366" Height="768"   xmlns:SilverlightInvaders2D=                       "clr-namespace:SilverlightInvaders2DVector">               <Button x:Name="btnStartGame"        Content="Start the game!"

Now, add the following lines of code, to program the event handler that will render    each frame and update the necessary SpriteWrapper instances calling many   previously programmed methods: private void RenderFrame object sender, EventArgs e  {      Hold the elapsed time after the last call to this method   TimeSpan elapsedTime =  DateTime.Now - _LastTick ;    for  int iTent = 0; iTent < _totalTents; iTent++    {     _tents[iTent].Update elapsedTime ;   }   for  int iAlien = 0; iAlien < _aliens.Count  ; iAlien++    {     _aliens[iAlien].Update elapsedTime ;   }   _ship.Update elapsedTime ;   CheckBounds  ;      Save the current time   _LastTick = DateTime.Now; }  5.	 Add the following lines of code, to program the event handler that will check the    key pressed and move the ship: private void Page_KeyDown  object sender, KeyEventArgs e    {   switch  e.Key     {     case Key.Left:                  _ship.GoLeft  ;                  break;     case Key.Right:                   _ship.GoRight  ;                   break;     case Key.Up:                _ship.GoUp  ;  [ 5 ]   Combining Sprites with Backgrounds                 break;     case Key.Down:                  _ship.GoDown  ;                  break;   } }  6.	 Finally, add the following lines of code, to program the event handler for the  button's Click event  this code will create all the sprites and start the game : private void btnStartGame_Click object sender, RoutedEventArgs e  {      Hide the button   btnStartGame.Visibility = Visibility.Collapsed;   CreateAliens  ;   CreateTents  ;   CreateShip  ;      Define the upper left corner and bottom right corner for the       animations   _upperLeftCorner = new Point _aliens[0].location.X,                       _aliens[0].location.Y ;   _bottomRightCorner = new Point LayoutRoot.ActualWidth –                   _colWidth, LayoutRoot.ActualHeight - _rowHeight ;      Save the current time   _LastTick = DateTime.Now;      Add an EventHandler to render each frame   CompositionTarget.Rendering += RenderFrame;      Add an EventHandler to check for each key down   this.KeyDown += new KeyEventHandler Page_KeyDown ; }  7.	 Build and run the solution. Click on the button and the 55 aliens will move from left   to right, down a row, right to left, down a row, left to right, and so on. At the same   time, they will rotate around their centers clockwise and counterclockwise, as   shown in the following picture:  [ 6 ]   Chapter 3  What just happened? You have dozens of vector-based XAML sprites moving in a Silverlight 3 application.   The game looks really nice. It seems that you will be part of a 3D games development   team very soon!  We can also move the ship using the cursor movement keys. The ship moves everywhere,  because we want to keep it simple. We will have more time to focus on controlling input  devices to provide great feedback later.  The aliens are always moving. Once we press a cursor movement key, the ship starts moving.  The tents  Halloween pumpkins  are motionless, but they are also sprites based on the  SpriteWrapper superclass. Hence we can add some animation to the tents.  The code programmed in the button's Click event handler is very simple, because it calls  previously added methods to do the following tasks:    Create the sprites: CreateAliens  ; CreateTents  ; CreateShip  ;  [ 7 ]           1.   2.   Combining Sprites with Backgrounds  Define the upper-left corner and bottom-right corner for the aliens' animation: _upperLeftCorner = new Point _aliens[0].location.X,   _aliens[0].location.Y ; _bottomRightCorner = new Point LayoutRoot.ActualWidth - _colWidth,   LayoutRoot.ActualHeight - _rowHeight ;  Save the current time for the first time: _LastTick = DateTime.Now;  Attach an event handler to render each frame: CompositionTarget.Rendering += RenderFrame;  Attach an event handler to be triggered when a key is down: this.KeyDown += new KeyEventHandler Page_KeyDown ;  That is all. The events begin to fire and the frames start rendering.  Animating multiple sprites The RenderFrame method acts as the main game loop. Thus, it is responsible for animating  the sprites. However, the code is very simple:  It calculates the elapsed time after the last call to this method: TimeSpan elapsedTime =  DateTime.Now - _LastTick ;  It calls the Update method for all the SpriteWrapper instances, sending the  calculated elapsed time as the unique parameter. It does this for the tents, the aliens  and the ship: for  int iTent = 0; iTent < _totalTents; iTent++  {   _tents[iTent].Update elapsedTime ; }  for  int iAlien = 0; iAlien < _aliens.Count  ; iAlien++  {   _aliens[iAlien].Update elapsedTime ; } _ship.Update elapsedTime ;  3.  Once the sprites are updated, it calls the CheckBounds method. This method is   responsible of moving the aliens down and inverting the movement direction and  the rotation direction when the bound has reached.  4.  Then it saves the current time that will be used in the next call to RenderFrame,    to update all the sprites taking into account the elapsed time: _LastTick = DateTime.Now;  [  ]   Chapter 3  Using the subclasses of SpriteWrapper or any other object-oriented  design to define the characters and their common behavior, we can  simplify the game loops.  Managing a complex game loop The more complex the game, the more complex the main game loop. However, using  methods with very clear names, we can create a complex game loop with code that we   can understand.  If you do not understand the code in the main game loop, you will not  be able to finish the game's development. Therefore, the code in the  main game loop must be very easy to read.  In this case, we also added some very simple code to the KeyDown event handler. When the  player presses one of the cursor movement keys, the event calls one of the four methods  offered by the ShipWrapper instance to specify movement directions. Then, these new  movement directions will be taken into account by the main game loop, controlled in the  previously explained RenderFrame method.  Time for action – detecting collisions between 2D characters Now, we are going to add a very simple collision detection capability to the sprites.  This is not a precise collision detection algorithm. We are going to use a very  simple technique to give some life to the game. However, we will improve our  collision detection algorithms later in the following chapters. Our current focus  is on a good object-oriented design for the sprites and on the modification of  the game loop.  We want the aliens to show a different color when they collide with the ship. We want to   see the changes necessary to add some logic to the game. We will do that by following   these steps:  1.	 Stay in the SilverlightInvaders2DVector project. 2.	 Open the code for the superclass SpriteWrapper. 3.	 Add the following public method to return a rectangle with the sprite's bounds:  public Rect UCBounds   {   return new Rect _location, _size ; }  [  ]   Combining Sprites with Backgrounds  4.	 Add the following public method to determine whether the SpriteWrapper   instance received as a parameter collides with this sprite's bounds: public bool CollidesWith SpriteWrapper spriteToCheck  {   Rect rect1 = UCBounds  ;   Rect rect2 = spriteToCheck.UCBounds  ;   rect1.Intersect rect2 ;   return  rect1 != Rect.Empty ; }  5.	 Add the following public method to paint the sprite with a linear gradient from the    first Color, which is received as a parameter, to the second one: public void PaintGradient Color newColor1, Color newColor2  {   LinearGradientBrush linearGradientBrush = new                              nearGradientBrush  ;   GradientStop gradientStop1 = new GradientStop  ;   gradientStop1.Color = newColor1;   gradientStop1.Offset = 0;   GradientStop gradientStop2 = new GradientStop  ;   gradientStop2.Color = newColor2;   gradientStop2.Offset = 1.0;   linearGradientBrush.StartPoint = new Point 0, 0 ;   linearGradientBrush.EndPoint = new Point 1, 1 ;   linearGradientBrush.GradientStops.Add gradientStop1 ;   linearGradientBrush.GradientStops.Add gradientStop2 ;       Obtain the main Canvas by its name      All the User Controls associated to a SpriteWrapper          must use the name LayoutRoot for the main Canvas   Canvas canvas =  _ucSpriteUC.FindName "LayoutRoot"  as Canvas ;   for  int i = 0; i < canvas.Children.Count; i++    {     if  canvas.Children[i] is Path      {       Path path =  canvas.Children[i] as Path ;          Fill each path with the linear gradient brush       path.Fill = linearGradientBrush;     }   } }  [ 100 ]   Chapter 3  6.	 Now, open MainPage.xaml.cs and add the following method to check for collisions    between the ship and the aliens that are alive: private void CheckCollisions   {   for  int iAlien = 0; iAlien < _aliens.Count  ; iAlien++    {     if  _aliens[iAlien].isAlive      {       if  _ship.CollidesWith _aliens[iAlien]         {         _aliens[iAlien].PaintGradient Colors.Red, Colors.White ;         _aliens[iAlien].isAlive = false;       }     }   } }  7.	 Add the following line of code to the RenderFrame method, after the    line CheckBounds  ;: CheckCollisions  ;  8.	 Build and run the solution. Click on the button and move the ship to the aliens.  Every time you touch an alien, it will stop moving and it will rotate on the spot,  painted with a red to white gradient, as shown in the following picture:  [ 101 ]   Combining Sprites with Backgrounds  What just happened? When you move the ship, you can change the aliens' colors and stop their advance against  the earth!  We added a few methods to the SpriteWrapper superclass and they allowed us to detect  collisions between any sprites that are inherited from it.  The UCBounds function returns a rectangle with the sprite's bounds, taking into account its  current location and its actual size.  The CollidesWith function receives a SpriteWrapper as a parameter and returns a bool  value indicating the result of the collision-detection algorithm between this instance and the  one received. The algorithm is very simple, as it intersects both bounding boxes. It uses the  Intersect method that assigns the intersection between the Rect  rect1  and the Rect  received as a parameter  rect2 :  rect1.Intersect rect2 ;  If the result is not an empty rectangle  Rect.Empty , there is an intersection:  return  rect1 != Rect.Empty ;  This does not mean that we have a real visual collision between the two graphics. The results  are not accurate, because the bounding box  the rectangle  is incompletely filled by the  shapes. When the rectangles collide but the shapes do not, the algorithm will still return  true, as shown in the following picture:  [ 102 ]   An ideal algorithm will return true only when real paths collision exists. However, this  requires extra work and we are not focussing on collision detection algorithms yet.   Thus, we can improve it later.  We added a CheckCollisions method in the MainPage class. It iterates through the alive  aliens to check whether one of them has collided with the ship. If this happens, it calls the  PaintGradient method for that alien and sets its isAlive property to false.  Chapter 3  if  _ship.CollidesWith _aliens[iAlien]   {   _aliens[iAlien].PaintGradient Colors.Red, Colors.White ;   _aliens[iAlien].isAlive = false; }  The RenderFrame method calls the CheckCollisions procedure after checking the  bounds for the aliens. As we can see, the main game loop is still very simple to understand.  Using colors to paint sprites When the ship collides with an alien, the PaintGradient method creates a new  LinearGradientBrush and two GradientStop instances, one for the starting   color and the other for the ending color:  LinearGradientBrush linearGradientBrush = new LinearGradientBrush  ; GradientStop gradientStop1 = new GradientStop  ; gradientStop1.Color = newColor1; gradientStop1.Offset = 0; GradientStop gradientStop2 = new GradientStop  ; gradientStop2.Color = newColor2; gradientStop2.Offset = 1.0;  It defines the starting point and ending point for the gradient:  linearGradientBrush.StartPoint = new Point 0, 0 ; linearGradientBrush.EndPoint = new Point 1, 1 ;  It adds each GradientStop instance to the GradientStops collection:  linearGradientBrush.GradientStops.Add gradientStop1 ; linearGradientBrush.GradientStops.Add gradientStop2 ;  The brush is ready to be applied to the Fill property of each path that is a child of the   main Canvas.  [ 103 ]   Combining Sprites with Backgrounds  In order to find the main Canvas, it uses the FindName method, passing "LayoutRoot"  as a parameter. We used that name in the User Controls created to be used as sprites. As it  returns an object, it is necessary to cast the result as a Canvas:  Canvas canvas =  _ucSpriteUC.FindName "LayoutRoot"  as Canvas ;  We must be very careful using the FindName method and casting its  result. It is very important to use naming conventions for the objects  defined in XAML, to avoid problems with the FindName method like  inappropriate castings.  Once it has the brush and the Canvas, it iterates through each of its children and changes  the Fill property for each Path:  for  int i = 0; i < canvas.Children.Count; i++  {   if  canvas.Children[i] is Path    {     Path path =  canvas.Children[i] as Path ;        Fill each path with the linear gradient brush     path.Fill = linearGradientBrush;   } }  The code is a bit complex because creating Silverlight brushes in C requires many steps.  Have a go hero – using backgrounds The competition organizers have uploaded your game preview to the game contest   website. Guess what! It is the most desired game.

[ 105 ]   Combining Sprites with Backgrounds  Summary  We learned a lot in this chapter about game loops, object-oriented classes for a game and  working with lists of objects. Specifically, we animated independent sprites at the same time,  while responding to the keys pressed by the player to control characters and some game  logic. We transformed complex game loops in easy to understand code, combining methods  with a good object-oriented design. We understood the creation of objects on the fly and  the basics of a game logic. We also began working with a simple collision algorithm and we  applied everything learned to animate other elements like backgrounds.  Now that we've learned about the advanced multiple sprites animation and control  combined with object-oriented designs for games, we're ready to add a new dimension to  our games and to begin working with 3D characters, which is the topic of the next chapter.   [ 106 ]   4  Working with 3D Characters  In order to create a nice 3D scene for a game, we must be able to work with 3D  DCC tools and then be able to load the models in our application. This seems to  be an easy task, involving just a few steps. However, it involves many file format  conversions that usually generate a lot of incompatibilities. There is always  trouble just around the corner when working with 3D meshes.Hence, we must  use the right tools and procedures to achieve our desired result.   In this chapter, we will take 3D elements from popular and professional 3D DCC tools and we   will show them rendered in real-time on the screen. By reading it and following the exercises  we will learn to:            Understand how to work in a 3D world that is shown in a 2D screen Take advantage of 3D DCC tools to create 3D models for our games Prepare the 3D elements to be loaded into our games Understand hardware and software real-time rendering processes Control transformations applied to meshes and 3D elements  The second remake assignment  So far, we have been working with raster and vector based sprites in 2D scenes. We were  able to use a good object-oriented design to generalize the most common tasks related to  sprite management. However, our first goal is to develop 3D scenes using Silverlight 3. How  can we load and display 3D characters in a 3D space using Silverlight?   Working with 3D Characters  We can do this by exploiting the powerful features offered by many 3D DCC tools to create and  export 3D models to the file formats that are compatible with the Silverlight 3D engine. Then,  we can combine these models with a good object-oriented design and we will be able to use  similar principles to the ones learned for raster and vector based sprites, but working in a 3D  space. It is time to begin working with 3D games, in particular a 3D space invaders game.  The key to success is preparing the 3D models before exporting them to the  required file formats. We must understand how 3D DCC tools work in order  to create compatible models for our games.   Time for Action – exporting a 3D model without  considering textures The vector-based prototype of the remake was indeed successful. You have signed your first  contract to develop a new remake! This time, you will have to create a 3D remake. Your first  assignment is to work with a 3D digital artist to choose a 3D model for the spaceship. In  order to do so, you have to watch the model being rendered, and rotate it in the 3D space.  This will allow you and the 3D digital artist to decide whether the spaceship is suitable or not  for this new game.  The 3D digital artist has been creating 3D models for DirectX games. Therefore, he is used to  working with the DirectX .x file format. As you do not know the appropriate 3D engine to use  with Silverlight in order to load the model, your first tests will be done using an XBAP WPF  application and an XAML 3D model. This will allow you to interact with the 3D model.  First, we are going to convert the model to the XAML file format using an open source   3D DCC tool:  1.

Save all the uncompressed files and folders Save all the uncompressed files and folders  in a new folder  C:\Silverlight3D\Invaders3D\3DModels\SPACESHIP01 .  The decompression process will create two new folders: Models and Textures.  [ 10 ]   Chapter 4  This 3D model, called Ship_06, was created by Skonk  e-mail:  skonk@xnafusion.com .

Once installed, you can preview the .x files, as shown in the  following screenshot, by double clicking on them in Windows Explorer:  3.	  If you do not have it yet, download and install Blender    http:  www.blender.org download get-blender  .  [ 10 ]   Working with 3D Characters  Blender is an excellent open source 3D DCC tool available for all major  operating systems. It is distributed under the GNU General Public License   http:  www.blender.org education-help faq gpl-for- artists  .

Download the latest version of the XAML Exporter for Blender from    http:  xamlexporter.codeplex.com . For example, one of the latest versions  is http:  xamlexporter.codeplex.com Release ProjectReleases. aspx?ReleaseId=25481DownloadId=63694. This script is developed  by TheRHogue and released under the Microsoft Public License  Ms-PL .  5.	 Save the downloaded Python script  the file with the .py extension  to Blender's  scripts folder. By default, it is C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\. blender\scripts. The filename for the version v0.48 of this script is   xaml_export.py. On some installations, the location for Blender's scripts   folder could also be C:\Documents and Settings\ \ Application Data\Blender Foundation\Blender\.blender\scripts.  6.	 Start Blender. Right-click on the cube  represented by a square in   the view . Press Del and click on Erase selected object s . This step is  necessary because we do not want the cube in our new 3D model.  7.	 Select File  Import  DirectX  .x …. Browse to the folder that holds the .x file     C:\Silverlight3D\Invaders3D\3DModels\SPACESHIP01\Models  and   select the file to import, Ship_06.x. Then, click on Import DirectX. The   spaceship mesh's default top view will appear on the screen, as shown in the   following screenshot:  [ 110 ]   Chapter 4  8.	 Save the model in Blender's native format. It will be useful for further format   conversions. Select File  Save…. Browse to the folder created to hold the new  models   C:\Silverlight3D\Invaders3D\3DModels\SPACESHIP01  and enter   the desired name, Ship01.blend. Then, click on Save As. Now, the model is   available to be loaded in Blender without the need to follow the aforementioned steps.  9.	 Click on Select  Select Deselect All in the menu that appears at the bottom of   the 3D model. There will be no elements selected on the viewport, as shown in   the following screenshot:  10.	 Click on Select  Select Deselect All again. Now, you will see all the elements  selected on the viewport. These two steps are necessary to ensure that all the   elements are going to be exported in the new file format.  11.	 Now, select File  Export  XAML  .xaml … in the main menu. The default folder   will be the same as the one used in the previous step. Hence, you will not need to  browse to another folder. Enter the desired name, Ship01.xaml. Then, click on   Export Xaml. Now, the model is available as an XAML 3D model.  [ 111 ]   Working with 3D Characters  12.	 Select View  Camera in the menu that appears at the bottom of the 3D model.  The spaceship mesh will appear as seen by the active camera. Select Render   Render current frame in the main menu and a new window will appear showing  the spaceship rendered by Blender's internal render engine, without using  the texture to envelope the mesh, as shown in the following screenshot:  What just happened? We used Blender's import and export capabilities to convert an existing 3D model designed  to work with DirectX or XNA Framework to the new XAML 3D file format. We imported the  DirectX .x model into Blender and then we exported it to XAML.  We used the default camera to render the model without textures on a 2D screen. The  rendering process takes a few seconds to show the results, because it is focused on offering  an accurate scene. When we render a scene using 3D DCC tools like Blender or 3D Studio  Max, they take the necessary time to offer the best possible 2D image that represents the   3D scene, according to the rendering technique used.  However, 3D games need to show many 3D models performing animations on the screen  in real-time. They require many successive rendering processes per second, in order to  generate many 2D images, representing the 3D scene, per second. A 3D game needs more  than 30 frames per second  FPS  to create a fluid animation.  [ 112 ]   Chapter 4  For this reason, the real-time rendering engines used for 3D games require  3D models with a lower polygon counts than the ones used to create realistic  3D scenes in 3D DCC tools. On one hand, this reduces the rendering process'  accuracy, but on the other hand, it allows the game to show a fluid animation.  The animation speed is often more important than the scene's definition in a 3D game. A  game showing excellent scenes but running at less than 5 FPS does not make sense. It will  make the player quit the game as soon as he notices the low animation speed. A 3D game  needs to provide a real-time response to the player.  XAML 3D models If we open the previously exported XAML 3D model  Ship01.xaml  using Internet   Explorer, it will show us the 3D spaceship rendered in the browser's window, as shown   in the following screenshot:  [ 113 ]   Working with 3D Characters  This happens because the XAML 3D model includes a definition for a 3D viewport and a  camera targeting the model  the spaceship . Internet Explorer is performing the rendering  process necessary to display a 3D model defined using XAML in a 2D screen.  We can display an XAML 3D model in any WPF application. We can create a 3D model using  XAML directives. However, this does not make sense when working with 3D games. We  would need a few days to create the spaceship model writing XAML code. As previously  explained for 2D art assets, drawing is easier than writing XAML code. 3D modelling is also  easier and more efficient than writing XAML code to define the 3D meshes that represent  the model. Besides, you are working with a great 3D digital artist that will provide you with  the necessary 3D models for your games.  We can also preview an XAML 3D model copying and pasting the XAML code in XamlPad, as  shown in the following screenshot:  The creation of XAML 3D models by writing XAML code is described in depth in 3D  Programming for Windows Three-Dimensional Graphics Programming for the Windows  Presentation Foundation by Charles Petzold, Microsoft Press.  [ 114 ]   Chapter 4  Time for action – from DCC tools to WPF Now, we are going to display the XAML 3D model exported from Blender in an   XBAP WPF application:  1.	 Create a new C project using the WPF Browser Application template in Visual   Studio or Visual C Express. Use 3DInvadersXBAP as the project's name.  2.	 Open the file that defines the XAML 3D model using Notepad or any  other text editor. Select all the content and copy it to the clipboard.  3.	 Open the XAML code for Page1.xaml  double-click on it in the Solution Explorer    and paste the previously copied XAML 3D model after the line that begins defining  the main Grid    . You will see the spaceship appear in the page in the  designer window. You can understand how an XAML 3D model is defined and  inserted in a Viewport3D container navigating through the document's outline,   as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 115 ]   Working with 3D Characters  4.	 Build and run the solution. The default web browser will appear showing the  spaceship rendered in the 2D window. Resize the web browser's window and  the model will scale. This time, it is running an XBAP WPF application.  What just happened? We showed the spaceship rendered in a viewport just copying and pasting the XAML 3D  model definition previously exported from a 3D DCC tool.  One of the great advantages of WPF applications is that we can preview the XAML 3D model  in design-time. We can also see the changes while we modify the properties in XAML code.  XBAP WPF applications with 3D content The key is the Viewport3D element  System.Windows.Controls.Viewport3D . It  allows the definition of 3D elements like cameras, models, meshes, lights, materials,   and 3D transforms, among others.  This line defines the Viewport3D element. The XAML export filter created it:  <Viewport3D xmlns="http:  schemas.microsoft.com winfx 2006 xaml  presentation" xmlns:x="http:  schemas.microsoft.com winfx 2006 xaml">  Inside the Viewport3D, we can find the Viewport3D.Camera element that defines a  camera targeting the model and the ModelVisual3D element  System.Windows. Media3D.ModelVisual3D  that, in this case, defines many transformations, lights,  materials, brushes and meshes.  We did not need to write a single line of code to preview and display the 3D model exported  from the 3D DCC tool. The tool created the necessary XAML code to describe the viewport,  a camera and the model's components, as shown in the following screenshot presenting a  more complete document's outline:  [ 116 ]   Chapter 4  Time for action – displaying a 3D model in a 2D screen  with WPF The 3D digital artist is still waiting to see the spaceship from different angles. He needs  to know if the model is appropriate for your game. You want to see the ship moving and  rotating in the screen. In order to do this, we must add some transformations and some   code to control them. We will add both XAML and C code:  1.	 Stay in the 3DInvadersXBAP project.  [ 117 ]   Working with 3D Characters  2.	 Open the XAML code for Page1.xaml and add the following lines of   code after    we are adding transformations for the   ModelVisual3D element :                             <AxisAngleRotation3D x:Name="rotateShip" Axis="1 0 0"                               Angle="100"   >                   <TranslateTransform3D x:Name="translateShip" OffsetX="0.0"                            OffsetY="0.0" OffsetZ="0.0"  >     <ScaleTransform3D x:Name="scaleShip" ScaleX="0.5"                       ScaleY="0.5" ScaleZ="0.5"  >        3.	 You will see the spaceship rotated and scaled down, as shown in the    following screenshot:  [ 11 ]   Chapter 4  4.	 Change the definition of the Grid element by the following  the grid must be  focusable and we are defining an event handler to capture the keys pressed :    5.	 Now, expand Page1.xaml in the Solution Explorer and open Page1.xaml.cs—the   C code for Page1.xaml.  double-click on it . We need to add an event handler to   change the values of some properties for the previously defined transformations   according to the keys pressed.  6.	 Add the following lines of code in the public partial class Page1 : Page,    to program the event handler for the KeyDown event: private void Grid_KeyDown object sender, KeyEventArgs e  {   switch  e.Key    {        Move the ship in the X; Y and Z axis     case Key.Left:         translateShip.OffsetX -= 0.05f;         break;     case Key.Right:         translateShip.OffsetX += 0.05f;         break;     case Key.Up:         translateShip.OffsetY += 0.05f;         break;     case Key.Down:         translateShip.OffsetY -= 0.05f;         break;     case Key.Z:         translateShip.OffsetZ -= 0.05f;         break;     case Key.X:         translateShip.OffsetZ += 0.05f;         break;        Rotate the ship     case Key.G:         rotateShip.Angle -= 1;         break;     case Key.H:         rotateShip.Angle += 1;         break;   } }  [ 11 ]   Working with 3D Characters  7.	 Add the following line of code to the constructor after the line    InitializeComponent  ;  we set the focus to the grid to capture   the keyboard events : grdGrid.Focus  ;  8.	 Build and run the solution. The default web browser will appear showing the   spaceship 3D model rendered in the 2D screen. Use the cursor movement keys  and the Z and X keys to move the spaceship in the X, Y, and Z axis. Use the G and  H keys to rotate the spaceship. You will see the spaceship moving and rotating in  real-time inside the web browser's viewport as shown in the following screenshot:  What just happened? The 3D digital artist could move and rotate the spaceship in real-time. You have decided that  the spaceship is suitable for this new game. The same code base could be used for many  other 3D models in order to watch them from different angles.  We changed the definition of the Grid element to allow it to be focusable   Focusable="True" , because we wanted to capture the keys pressed by the , because we wanted to capture the keys pressed by the   user. Besides, we defined an event handler for the KeyDown event.  [ 120 ]   Chapter 4  Understanding the 3D world We added tree transforms for the ModelVisual3D that contains the meshes that define  the 3D model. They transform the model, not the camera. However, the model is viewed  through the camera defined in the Viewport3D container. This is one of the main  differences between the 2D world and the 3D world.  In a 2D scene, we can easily understand dimensions, because we work with pixels and a  great pixel grid.  In a 3D scene, the active camera defines an eye for the models. Hence, when this scene  is rendered in a 2D screen, we can see a part of the entire 3D world through the camera's  lens. The camera changes the perspective for the 3D models that compose the 3D world.  Hence, we work with relative dimensions, because what is seen in the 2D screen can change  according to the camera used and its properties.  In this case, we apply the transforms to the model and we are keeping the camera stationary.  We defined a Transform3DGroup to group the three transforms.  The ScaleTransform3D, named scaleShip, enables us to change its ScaleX, ScaleY,  and ScaleZ properties to shrink or stretch the meshes that compose the model. This is done  in the following line:  <ScaleTransform3D x:Name="scaleShip" ScaleX="0.5" ScaleY="0.5"                    ScaleZ="0.5"  >  Initially, we scale down the spaceship proportionally to 50% of its original size.  The TranslateTransform3D, named translateShip, enables us to move the model's  meshes through the 3D space. We can do this changing its OffsetX, OffsetY, and  OffsetZ properties in order to change its position in the X; Y and Z axis. This is done in   the following line:  <TranslateTransform3D x:Name="translateShip" OffsetX="0.0"                        OffsetY="0.0" OffsetZ="0.0"  >  The RotateTransform3D is a little more complex, because it adds a Rotation and an  AxisAngleRotation3D named rotateShip. It enables us to rotate the model's meshes  through its X-axis. We can do this by changing its Angle property to rotate the model around   its defined central point. This is done in the following lines:            <AxisAngleRotation3D x:Name="rotateShip" Axis="1 0 0" Angle="100"        >        [ 121 ]   Working with 3D Characters  The central points can be defined in the RotateTransform3D element, using the CenterX,  CenterY, and CenterZ properties. In this case, we defined a single rotation, around the  X-axis. However, we can add more RotateTransform3D groups to define new rotations  around different axes. The Axis property specifies the axis that will rotate according to  the value assigned to the Angle property. It requires three binary numbers separated by a  space, a 1 indicates that the axis represented in the position  X; Y and Z  should rotate. For  example, the following line indicates that the rotation should be done in the X-axis     If we want to rotate in the Y-axis, we should change Axis="1 0 0" by Axis="0 1 0".  We can define many RotateTransform3D groups, like in the following lines of code, in which  we create three independent rotations: rotateShipX, rotateShipY, and rotateShipZ:            <AxisAngleRotation3D x:Name="rotateShipX" Axis="1 0 0"                           Angle="100"  >                 <AxisAngleRotation3D x:Name="rotateShipY" Axis="0 1 0" Angle="50"       >                 <AxisAngleRotation3D x:Name="rotateShipZ" Axis="0 0 1" Angle="25"       >        One of the simplest ways of mastering the 3D world and understanding how  3D models move in the 3D space is defining transformations and changing  the values of their properties. Using a WPF application and XAML code,  we can see a preview in real-time, while we change the rotation values, as  shown in the following screenshot that presents the spaceship with the  three aforementioned rotations defined:  [ 122 ]   Chapter 4  X, Y, and Z in practice As previously explained, the 2D world uses a bi-dimensional coordinate system. The 3D  world uses a three-dimensional coordinate system. It adds the Z-axis. However, WPF   also changes the way the Y-axis works in the 3D world, because the model moves up   when the Y-axis increases.  [ 123 ]   Working with 3D Characters  The following diagram illustrates the way the X-coordinate, Y-coordinate, and Z-coordinate  values work to display elements in a 3D scene:  +  increase   Y axis  -  reduce   -  reduce   +  increase   X axis  +  increase   Z axis  -  reduce   The following list explains the previous diagram in detail:              If we want to move right, we must increase the X-coordinate's value If we want to move left, we must reduce the X-coordinate's value If we want to move up, we must increase the Y-coordinate's value If we want to move down, we must reduce the Y-coordinate's value If we want to move front, we must increase the Z-coordinate's value If we want to move back, we must reduce the Z-coordinate's value  Nevertheless, we must be very careful, because the three-dimensional  coordinate system used in our games will be relative to the active camera. The  camera's position and its target in the 3D space will set the baselines for the  three-dimensional coordinate system. A camera can view the three-dimensional  coordinate system from any direction.  The code programmed in the KeyDown event handler takes into account the key that  is pressed and reduces or increases the value of the OffsetX, OffsetY, or OffsetZ  properties for the translate transform.  It also changes the Angle value of the previously explained X-axis rotate transform.  GPU 3D acceleration Real-time rendering of 3D scenes is a very complex process. On one hand, we have a screen  capable of showing 2D images  X and Y , but on the other hand, we have 3D models in a  3D world  X, Y, and Z . There is a very easy to understand asymmetry problem. Therefore,  in order to show the 3D scene in a 2D screen, a rendering process must create a 2D image   [ 124 ]   Chapter 4  in a specific resolution that shows the portion of the whole 3D world seen by the lens of an  active camera. The screen can display the resulting 2D image.  The rendering process for a single frame requires thousands of complex mathematics  operations. We need a performance of at least 30 FPS to create a responsive 3D game.  For this reason, the real-time rendering process will require hundreds of thousands of  mathematics operations per second.  Therefore, there is specialized hardware dedicated to accelerating real-time 3D rendering  processes. We have already talked about GPUs.  WPF and XBAP WPF applications take advantage of the presence of GPUs to perform   real-time 3D rendering processes. Hence, they can offer great performance for 3D games  that need to render complex models.  So far, Silverlight 3 does not offer the possibility to use a GPU to perform real- time 3D rendering processes. When working with Silverlight, we will have to  use software based rendering. This means that the rendering process will run  on the CPU s  and their available processing cores. Hence, if we need more  power for our game, we can take advantage of XBAP WPF applications' advanced  capabilities.  Understanding meshes In the following diagram, we can see the wire-mesh view of the 3D model that represents   the spaceship:  [ 125 ]   Working with 3D Characters  This mesh defines the spaceship using many primitive elements  points, lines, triangles, and  polygons . We can use materials and textures to paint and envelope the different faces. As  we can see, this is a wire-mesh with a low polygon counts. This is very important, because 3D  DCC tools are able to work with meshes with hundreds of thousands of polygons. However,  they would require too much processing time to successfully render them in real-time. We  must remember that we must show at least 30 FPS.  We can understand how to work with meshes using 3D DCC tools. They will  provide us an interactive experience with the 3D models and we will be able to use  this knowledge in developing 3D games that interact with meshes and models.   We are going to work with 3D DCC tools in order to create the 3D models and their meshes  for our games.  Time for action – using other XAML exporter for DCC tools The 3D digital artist has to develop new models for the game. However, he is going to  develop them using 3D Studio Max. He wants to see a few spheres in the scene to check  whether the XAML exporter he found works fine or not.  Now, we are going to convert the model to the XAML file format using an open source XAML  exporter for 3D Studio Max:  1.	 Download the most recent release of the XAML exporter for 3D   Studio Max from http:  max2xaml.codeplex.com .  Timmy Kokke  Sorskoot  developed the XAML exporter for 3D Studio Max  as an open source project in CodePlex.  2.	 Save all the uncompressed files in a new folder  C:\Silverlight3D\ Invaders3D\3DModels\MAX_XAML_EXPORTER . The decompression  process will create three files: XamlExport.ms, Main.ms, and and Utils.ms.  3.	 Now, start 3D Studio Max.  3D Studio Max is commercial software. However, you can download a free  fully functional 30-day trial for non-commercial use from Autodesk's website:  http:  usa.autodesk.com   [ 126 ]   4.	 Add three spheres using 15 segments and assign each one a material, as shown    in the following screenshot:  Chapter 4  5.	  It is very important to assign a material to each element, because if there is an  element without a material, the script used to export to XAML will not work. If you  are facing problems, remember that the 3D digital artist left the spheres.max file  in the following folder  C:\Silverlight3D\Invaders3D\3DModels\SPHERES .  6.	 Save the file using the name spheres.max in the aforementioned folder. 7.	 Select MAXScript  Run script…. Browse to the folder in which you decompressed    the export scripts  C:\Silverlight3D\Invaders3D\3DModels\MAX_XAML_ EXPORTER  and choose Main.ms. Then, click on Open. A new window will   appear showing the title Max2Xaml.  8.	 Click on Export. Browse to the same folder in which you saved the original 3D Studio    Max model and enter spheres.xaml in the Name textbox. Then, click on Save.   The exporter will show the XAML output. Now, the model is available as an XAML   resource dictionary.  What just happened? We used an open source XAML exporter to create an XAML 3D model from a 3D Studio Max  file. However, we cannot preview the model using a web browser or XamlPad, as previously  done with the spaceship.  [ 127 ]   Working with 3D Characters  This XAML exporter creates a resource dictionary with all the data for the meshes and  materials. Hence, there is no Viewport3D definition. We will have to work a bit harder   to include the meshes in a 3D scene.  Time for action – adding 3D elements and interacting with  them using Expression Blend Now, we are going to add the 3D elements exported from 3D Studio Max to our existing  XBAP WPF application:  1.	 Open the project 2.	 Select Project  Add existing item…. Choose the previously exported    project 3DInvadersXBAP in Expression Blend.  spheres.xaml and click on  and click on Open.  3.	 Click on the Resources panel and expand spheres.xaml. You will see three    MeshGeometry3D, three MaterialGroup, and a as shown in the following screenshot:  and a Model3DGroup listed,    4.	 Now, open the XAML code for Page1.xaml and add the following lines of code  after the Page definition  we are merging the resource dictionary that contains   the definition for the 3D elements in the main page :                                  [ 12 ]   Chapter 4  You can also do the previous step without adding any code, by right-clicking on  the Page element and selecting Linking to Resource Dictionary, spheres. xaml.  5.	 Add the following code after the line   that ends the  definition for the camera element  we are adding a new GeometryModel3D  element for each sphere, using the names sphere01, sphere02, and sphere03 :                                                        6.	 Click on Viewport3D under Objects and Timeline and expand its children. Select    sphere01 go to its Properties tab.  7.	 Expand Miscellaneous, click on Geometry and select Local resource  gSphere01    from the context menu that appears. This step assigns the MeshGeometry3D   resource defined in the resource dictionary.  [ 12 ]   Working with 3D Characters  8.	 Expand Materials, click on Material and select Local resource  m01_-_Default from    the context menu that appears. This step assigns the MaterialGroup resource   defined in the resource dictionary. Now, you will see a new sphere in the scene,   as shown in the following screenshot:  9.	 Go back to the XAML code and you will see that new code was added to the  GeometryModel3D element. The line that defines this element will be this: <GeometryModel3D x:Name="sphere01"                   Geometry="{DynamicResource gSphere01}"                   Material="{DynamicResource m01_-_Default}"  > 10.	 Repeat the steps 6 to 9 for the other two spheres, sphere02 and sphere03,   assigning them the MeshGeometry3D gSphere02 and gSphere03, and  then the MaterialGroup m02_-_Default and m03_-_Default.  [ 130 ]   Chapter 4  What just happened? We added the XAML 3D models created in 3D Studio Max to our 3D scene in an XBAP   WPF application.  First, we added the resource dictionary to the solution. Then, we created new  GeometryModel3D elements for each sphere. Finally, we assigned the mesh   definitions and the materials to each sphere.  Interacting with 3D elements using Expression Blend Expression Blend is very helpful when we need to interact with 3D elements contained in  a Viewport3D. We can see and change properties for the 3D elements that generate the  scene. Therefore, we can also learn how things work in the 3D space without the need to  write XAML code.  Visual Studio shows a preview of the scene, but it does not allow the same interaction than  this tool. Expression Blend allows us to interact visually with the 3D elements, offering the  possibility to design the scenes placing and moving elements. For example, we can rotate the  spaceship using the mouse, as shown in the following diagram:  [ 131 ]   Working with 3D Characters  Silverlight and the 3D world  So far, we have been adding 3D models to an XBAP WPF application. We exported the  models from Blender and 3D Studio Max and we were able to include them in a 3D scene.  However, we want to do this using Silverlight, which does not have official support for 3D  XAML models. How can we create 3D scenes using real-time rendering in Silverlight 3?   We can do this using a 3D graphics engine designed to add software based real-time  rendering capabilities to Silverlight. We have two excellent open source alternatives   for this goal:      Kit3D  http:  www.codeplex.com Kit3D . It is developed by Mark Dawson.  Matches the System.Windows.Media.Media3D namespace from WPF. It offers  a subset of WPF 3D capabilities and it offers a very fast rendering pipeline. Its main  drawback is that it does not offer a mechanism to load meshes. Therefore, you have  to create the meshes using C code. It is a good alternative for 3D games that use  simple basic meshes like boxes, cubes, and spheres. Balder  http:  www.codeplex.com Balder . Einar Ingebrigtsen leads its  development team. It is intended to be used in games, for this reason it uses a  model similar than the one found in XNA Framework. It offers many features that  make it simple to begin developing games with this engine. It offers the possibility   to load models from many popular file formats. It is an excellent alternative for   3D games that need to show many 3D models designed using DCC tools.  We will use Balder to add 3D real-time rendering capabilities to Silverlight for our real-time rendering capabilities to Silverlight for our  games. However, in some cases, you may find Kit3D to be a very useful alternative.  Time for action – exporting a 3D model to ASE So far, Balder does not offer support for XAML 3D models. However, it works fine with the  ASE  3D Studio Max ASCII Scene Exporter  file format. 3D Studio Max offers the possibility to  export ASE files from a 3D scene. However, the spaceship model is now in Blender format.  First, we are going to install a script to allow Blender to export models to the ASE format and  then we will save the spaceship in the new file format which is compatible with Balder:  1.	 Download the latest version of the Goofos ASE export script for Blender from    http:  www.katsbits.com htm tools_utilities.htm. For example, one   of the latest versions is http:  www.katsbits.com files blender  goofosASE-2.44v0.6.10b_9sept07.zip. This script is developed by Goofos   and released under the GNU GPL license.  [ 132 ]   Chapter 4  2.	 Decompress the downloaded ZIP file and copy the Python script  the file with  the .py extension  to Blender's scripts folder. By default, it is C:\Program  Files\Blender Foundation\.blender\scripts. The file name for the  version 6.10b of this script is goofosASE-2.44v0.6.10b_9sept07.py.  3.	 Restart Blender and open the spaceship model  previously saved in   Blender's native format as Ship01.blend in C:\Silverlight3D\ Invaders3D\3DModels\SPACESHIP01 .  4.	 Now, select File  Export  ASCII Scene  .ase  v0.6.10. The default folder will be    the same used in the previous step. Hence, you will not need to browse to another   folder. Enter the desired name, Ship01.ase. Then, click on Export ASCII Scene.   A dialog box will appear.  5.	 Click on Selection only to deselect this option. This will tell the script to export    all the elements in the scene and not just the selected ones, as shown in the   following screenshot:  6.	 Click on OK. Now, the model is available as an ASE 3D model, ready to be loaded    in Silverlight using Balder.  What just happened? We used Blender's export capabilities to convert an existing 3D model to the ASE file format,  using the Goofos ASE export script.  Time for action – installing Balder 3D engine Now, we are going to create a new Silverlight application adding the necessary references to  use the Balder 3D engine:  1.	 Download the most recent release of Balder from   http:  www.codeplex.com Balder.  [ 133 ]   Working with 3D Characters  Balder is a very active project. Thus, it regularly releases new versions adding  additional features and fixing bugs. Sometimes, a new version can introduce  changes to classes or methods. In the following examples, we will use version 1.0.  2.	 Save all the uncompressed files in a new folder  C:\Balder . 3.	 Create a new C project using the Silverlight Application template in Visual Studio   or Visual C Express. Use 3DInvadersSilverlight as the project's name. 4.	 Select File  Add Reference… and add the following DLLs from Balder's folder:      Balder.Core.Silverlight.dll  Balder.Silverlight.dll  5.	 Now, the project will list the references to the aforementioned Balder's DLLs in    the Solution Explorer, as shown in the following screenshot:  What just happened? We downloaded Balder and we added the necessary references to use it in a Silverlight  project. The previously explained steps are the only ones required to access Balder's  components and services in any new Silverlight application.  [ 134 ]   Chapter 4  Time for action – from DCC tools to Silverlight Now, we are going to display the ASE 3D model exported from Blender in a Silverlight  application with Balder's help:  1.	 Stay in the 3DInvadersSilverlight project. 2.	 Create a new folder in 3DInvadersSilverlight  the main project that will    generate the XAP output file . Rename it to Assets.  3.	 Right-click on the previously mentioned folder and select  and select Add  Existing item…    from the context menu that appears.  4.	 Go to the folder in which you saved the 3D model in the ASE format    C:\Silverlight3D\Invaders3D\3DModels\SPACESHIP01 .   Select the ASE file and click on Add.  5.	 Click on the ASE file added in the previous step. Change its Build Action    property to Resource.  6.	 Open the XAML code for MainPage.xaml  double-click on it in the  Solution Explorer  and replace the existing code with the following: <UserControl x:Class="_3DInvadersSilverlight.MainPage"   xmlns="http:  schemas.microsoft.com winfx 2006 xaml           presentation"    xmlns:x="http:  schemas.microsoft.com winfx 2006 xaml"    Width="1366" Height="768" >            7.	 Create a new class, InvadersGame. 8.	 Add the following lines of code at the beginning  as we are going to use many    Balder's classes and interfaces : using Balder.Core; using Balder.Core.FlatObjects; using Balder.Core.Geometries; using Balder.Core.Lighting; using Balder.Core.Math;  subclass of Game : public class InvadersGame : Game  [ 135 ]  9.	 Replace the new InvadersGame class declaration with the following  it has to be a     Working with 3D Characters  10.	 Add the following lines to define two private variables:     The spaceship's mesh private Mesh _ship;    A light private Light _light;  11.	 Override the Initialize method to change some properties on the main    viewport defined by Balder: public override void Initialize   {   base.Initialize  ;   Display.BackgroundColor = Colors.White;   Viewport.XPosition = 0;   Viewport.YPosition = 0;   Viewport.Width = 1366;   Viewport.Height = 768; }  12.	 Override the LoadContent method to load the spaceship's mesh, create a light,    and define the main camera's target: public override void LoadContent   {   base.LoadContent  ;   _ship = ContentManager.Load  "ship01.ase" ;   Scene.AddNode _ship ;    _light = new OmniLight  ;   _light.Position.X = 0;   _light.Position.Y = 0;   _light.Position.Z = -30;   _light.ColorAmbient = Colors.Red;   _light.ColorDiffuse = Colors.Purple;   _light.ColorSpecular = Colors.Magenta;   Scene.AddNode _light ;   Camera.Target.X = 0;   Camera.Target.Y = 0;   Camera.Target.Z = 15; }  [ 136 ]   13.	 Override the Update method to leave it ready to add some scene management    Chapter 4  code in it later: public override void Update   {   base.Update  ;      TODO: Add code to update the scene }  14.	 Now, expand App.xaml in the Solution Explorer and open App.xaml.cs—the C  code for App.xaml. We need to add some code to the StartUp event handler   to initialize Balder with our game class.  15.	 Add the following lines of code at the beginning  as we are going to use many    Balder's classes and interfaces : using Balder.Core.Runtime; using Balder.Silverlight.Services;  16.	 Add the following lines of code to the event handler for the Application_ Startup event, after the line this.RootVisual = new MainPage  ;: TargetDevice.Initialize   ;  17.	 Build and run the solution. The default web browser will appear showing   the spaceship colored in red, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 137 ]   Working with 3D Characters  What just happened? The 3D digital artist is very happy because the spaceship can be loaded and shown using  Silverlight. Now, he trusts you and he will continue to work on exciting 3D models for your   game. However, do not be quiet, because you still have to learn many things about cameras  and lights.  We showed the spaceship rendered in a Balder's viewport. We had to work a bit more than  with the XAML 3D model in the XBAP WPF application. However, we could load and render   a 3D model previously exported from a 3D DCC tool using the ASE file format.  One of the drawbacks of Silverlight 3D applications using Balder is that we cannot preview  the 3D model during design-time. However, we can experiment with an XBAP WPF  application and then, we can work with Silverlight.  Displaying a 3D model in a 2D screen with Silverlight Once we have the model in the ASE file format and Balder is installed and added as a  reference, the steps to load and show a 3D model in Silverlight are the following:  1.  Add the ASE model to the Assets folder. It must be built as a Resource. 2.  Override the game class's LoadContent method to load the model, creating a new   mesh using the ContentManager, as done in the following line: _ship = ContentManager.Load  "ship01.ase" ;  3.  Add the new mesh to the scene using the AddNode method:  Scene.AddNode _ship ;  lights, and the meshes:  4.  Override the game class's Update method to manage the scene, the cameras, the   Before following those steps, we must be sure that we have configured the main viewport,  the main camera, and the necessary lights.  In order to start the engine's run-time, Balder requires just one line of code, such as the  following one:  TargetDevice.Initialize   ;  We must replace InvadersGame by the main game class  it must be a   Balder.Core.Game subclass .  [ 13 ]   Using 3D vectors Balder works with 3D vectors  Balder.Core.Math.Vector  to define positions in the  3D space. For example, the common Position property is a 3D vector, with the following  fields: X; Y and Z.  We used Balder's 3D vectors to define the position for the light:  Chapter 4  And, we used another 3D vector to specify the main camera's target:  _light.Position.X = 0; _light.Position.Y = 0; _light.Position.Z = -30;  Camera.Target.X = 0; Camera.Target.Y = 0; Camera.Target.Z = 15;  These vectors allow many complex math operations, like translations and transforms. They  will simplify the code needed to control perspectives and cameras.  Have a go hero – working with multiple 3D characters The project manager that hired you wants to see your recent work. He is very happy to   know you are able to work with existing 3D models in your new games in XBAP WPF and   in Silverlight.  He asks you to prepare a new XBAP WPF application showing a model of a car. He wants the  main camera to rotate around the car.  But wait, he also wants a Silverlight version of the same application. You can do it using  Balder as the 3D engine.  Remember the elapsed time technique learned when working with 2D characters. You can  also use it with 3D models.  Once you finish these new applications, you can add a motorbike and make some effects  using different colors in the lights.  Pop quiz – 3D models and real-time rendering  1.

We can see a portion of the whole 3D world simulated in a 2D screen,   as seen through a specific camera.  c.  We can see the whole 3D world as polygons without textures.  Summary  We learned a lot in this chapter about 3D models, meshes, and other elements. Specifically,  we imported, exported and prepared 3D models using 3D DCC tools in order to load them in  our applications. We showed models in XBAP WPF using XAML and in Silverlight applications  using the services provided by a specialized 3D engine. We rendered and transformed the  meshes in real-time using both hardware-based and software-based rendering processes.  We understood the usage of a Silverlight 3D engine and we began controlling some aspects  of the 3D elements.  Now that we've started working with 3D characters for our games, we're ready to control  lights and cameras to create dazzling real-time scenes, which is the topic of the next chapter.  [ 140 ]   5  Controlling the Cameras:   Giving Life to Lights and Actions  In order to create dazzling real-time scenes, we must understand how 3D  cameras work. Only then we will be able to control their properties and switch  between multiple cameras to give life to our 3D models located in a 3D world.  The 3D cameras are both complex and powerful. Hence, we must reduce their  complexity to keep things simple, and must be able to exploit their power  without reading Pitagora's bookshelf.   In this chapter, we will learn everything we need to know about 3D cameras so that we  can render our models in real time on a 2D screen from different angles. By reading it and  following the exercises, we will learn to:            Understand how to work with the most important properties of 3D cameras Control transformations applied to cameras and understand their effects on the  rendered view Prepare the cameras according to our scene needs Work with many cameras with different parameters Control the part of the 3D world rendered in the 2D screen   Controlling the Cameras: Giving Life to Lights and Actions  Understanding 3D cameras  So far, we have been working with simple 3D scenes and have used a single camera. We  were able to show a 3D model, previously exported from a 3D DCC tool in both an XBAP  WPF application and in Silverlight. However, we neither moved the camera nor changed its  properties. How can we define and control many cameras to give life to lights and actions?  We can do this by exploiting the powerful camera classes offered by WPF and Balder. We can  define many different kinds of cameras and change their properties in real time. Then, we  can combine the camera's management with the model's animations and create amazing  scenes from a 3D world in a 2D screen.  Understanding how cameras work is very important if you want to  control the part of the great 3D world rendered in the 2D screen.  Time for action – when seeing is believing Your project manager wants the game's player to be able to select between many available  spaceships. Two 3D digital artists are creating new models using 3D DCC tools. He wants you  to control many cameras in real time to show a ship from many different angles. The player  should be able to choose one active camera. This technique is very common in 3D games  where the player must choose a desired character.  However, there is a big problem. The 3D digital artist who is working with you, knows about  the cameras used in the 3D DCC tools, whereas you do not have any idea of how to work  with cameras in Balder. Do not worry. The best way to understand how cameras work is by  previewing what happens when you change the values of the parameters that manage their  behavior. Luckily, using Expression Blend, you can see what happens in the Viewport3D  when you change the values. As you need to learn to accomplish this task quickly, we will  begin working with this tool to see what happens:  1.  Open the 3DInvadersXBAP project in Expression Blend. 2.  Open Page1.xaml.  The spaceship will be shown in the Viewport3D component.  3.  Click on Viewport3D under Objects and Timeline and expand its children. 4.  Expand Camera, select PerspectiveCamera, and go to its Properties tab. You   will see two panels, Transform and Camera, with many properties as shown in the  following screenshot:  [ 142 ]   Chapter 5  5.  Copy the XAML code that defines the Viewport3D.Camera element and its  children. Save this part of the code because you will be changing many values  and will want to recall the original parameters. The original code that defines a  perspective camera and its transformations is the following:     <PerspectiveCamera FarPlaneDistance="100.000000"                       NearPlaneDistance="0.100000"                       UpDirection="0,1,0" LookDirection="0,0,-1"                       Position="0,0,0" FieldOfView="49.134343">                                                  <AxisAngleRotation3D                                   Axis="0.772239,0.341341,0.535848"                                   Angle="77.185380875237655" >                               <TranslateTransform3D OffsetX="7.4811315536499023"                                OffsetY="-6.5076398849487305"                                OffsetZ="5.3436651229858398" >                      [ 143 ]   Controlling the Cameras: Giving Life to Lights and Actions  6.  Click on the Camera Orbit button in the toolbox or press O. 7.  Click on the spaceship and drag the mouse to move the camera up, down, left, and  right. The values of X, Y, and Z for Position, Direction, and Up Vector will change as  you drag the mouse. The part of the scene rendered in the Viewport3D will change  as you change these properties for the perspective camera. For example, you will  be able to move the camera in order to see one of the spheres, as shown in the  following screenshot:  8.  Click on the spaceship again and hold the Alt key while dragging the mouse down  to move the camera further away from the look-at point  the spaceship model .  Repeat this sequence many times, until you see the three spheres in the Viewport3D  as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 144 ]   Chapter 5  Holding the Alt key while dragging the mouse up, you can move  the camera closer to the look-at point.  9.  Change the values of X, Y, and Z for Position, Direction, and Up Vector. You can   enter the new numeric values, drag the mouse in the textboxes, or drag the handles  shown at the lefthand side of the textboxes. You can also move the direction that  is up for the camera by rotating the Up line and dragging the mouse to the desired  position. The models seen in the scene rendered in the Viewport3D will rotate as  you drag the mouse. Besides, the values of X, Y, and Z for Up Vector will change as  you drag the Up line, as shown in the following screenshot:  The 3D models rendered in the Viewport3D will appear to be rotating.  However, you are changing the parameters for the camera. The models  remain in their original positions in the 3D world and the camera is the  only element that is changing.  What just happened? We saw what happens when changing the parameters for a perspective camera. The 3D  models are rendered in the 2D screen taking into account the new parameters, and we can  create animations without moving or rotating the models.  When rendering 3D scenes in a 2D screen, a camera represents a vantage point. The   easiest way to understand how a camera component works is comparing it with a video  camera's behavior.  [ 145 ]   Controlling the Cameras: Giving Life to Lights and Actions  If you watch a real-life scene through a video camera, you will not be able to see the entire  3D world in which you are located. You will see a part of the whole 3D world rendered in  the video camera's 2D LCD screen. You can move the video camera in many ways using your  hands and you can walk while recording the video. You can also rotate the video camera  using your hands.  You can also zoom in to get closer to a look-at point or zoom out to move further away from  it. The part of the whole 3D world rendered in the video camera's 2D LCD screen will change  as you translate and rotate the video camera in the 3D space, zoom in, or zoom out.  The same happens when using camera components to render virtual 3D worlds in a 2D  screen. You can perform nearly the same operations than you can perform with a real video  camera. However, you will be performing these by changing the values of many parameters  instead of moving the camera with your hand.  Controlling the position, the direction, and the up vector We changed the values for some of the parameters defined in the following XAML line:  <PerspectiveCamera FarPlaneDistance="100.000000"                     NearPlaneDistance="0.100000" UpDirection="0,1,0"                     LookDirection="0,0,-1" Position="0,0,0"                     FieldOfView="49.134343">  We used Expression Blend's interactive tools. However, we could have done it by changing  the values in the XAML code, or using the C code to access the perspective camera's  properties.  The camera has to be located in a specific position in the 3D world. We altered this location  by changing the X, Y, and Z fields of the Position object  a Point3D .  Remember that X = 0, Y = 0, and Z = 0 represent the center of the 3D  world—the point where the three axis join. For example, Position="0,  0, 0" means X = 0, Y = 0, and Z = 0.  The camera has to point in some direction. We altered the camera's direction by changing  the values of the X, Y, and Z fields of the LookDirection object  a Vector3D .  The initial value made the camera point in the direction of the negative Z axis,  LookDirection="0,0,-1" means X = 0, Y = 0, and Z = -1.  The camera needs an orientation. We altered it by changing the values of the X, Y, and Z fields  of the UpDirection object  a Vector3D . The initial value made the camera's orientation  point upward  the top points in the positive Y direction . UpDirection="0,1,0" means X  = 0, Y = 1, and Z = 0. We can see how the position, the direction, and the up vector affect the  camera in the following diagram:  [ 146 ]   Chapter 5  Time for action – performing transformations Your project manager brings you a diagram that illustrates how to show each spaceship to  the player. The camera has to rotate around the model, as shown in the following diagram:  [ 147 ]   Controlling the Cameras: Giving Life to Lights and Actions  Now, we will take advantage of the transformations defined for the perspective camera. We  will see how to move and rotate the camera around the model using Expression Blend:  1.  Stay in the 3DInvadersXBAP project. 2.  Change the perspective camera's properties to get a whole picture of the spaceship,   as shown in the following screenshot:  3.  Expand the Transform panel for the perspective camera. 4.  Click on the Rotate tab and change the values for the Z angle. The camera will rotate   and the scene will be rendered according to the new angle.  5.  Click on the Translate tab and change the values for the X and Y axis. The camera   will move to the new position and the scene will be rendered according to the new  part of the whole 3D world that can be seen through the camera, as shown in the  following screenshot:  [ 14 ]   Chapter 5  What just happened? In order to show the spaceship as your project manager wants, you need to translate and  rotate the camera around the 3D model. Thus, using transformations like the ones previously  explained for the 3D model, you could translate and rotate the camera to perform the task.  The transformations applied to the camera change its position and rotation angles. As the  active camera defines an eye for the models in the 3D world therefore, moving and rotating  the camera animates the models in our 2D screen.  In this case, we apply the transformations to the camera while we keep the models in a  stationary position in the 3D world. We use the Transform3DGroup to group the three  transforms. Blender created this default transformation group when we exported the   model to XAML.  So far, the camera and the transformations do not have names. It is good  practice to give names to the XAML elements. This way, we will be able to  access the elements through the C code.  [ 14 ]   Controlling the Cameras: Giving Life to Lights and Actions  Defining and applying transformations The TranslateTransform3D enables us to move the camera meshes through the 3D  space. We can do this by changing its OffsetX, OffsetY, and OffsetZ properties in   order to change its position in the X, Y, and Z axis. This is done in the following line:  <TranslateTransform3D OffsetX="7.4811315536499023"                        OffsetY="-6.5076398849487305"                       OffsetZ="5.3436651229858398" >  Initially, the RotateTransform3D adds a rotation and an AxisAngleRotation3D. This is  done in the following lines:            <AxisAngleRotation3D Axis="0.772239,0.341341,0.535848"                           Angle="77.185380875237655" >        However, we learned to use the RotateTransform3D with the model's meshes, defining  the axis to rotate and the desired angle. This time, we copied and pasted the XAML exported  from Blender, therefore the technique is slightly different. Once we change the values  using Expression Blend, it will define a new RotateTransform3D using the syntax that we  previously learned when rotating the model's meshes:           In this case, there is a definition for a single rotation around the Z-axis. As we explained  for the model's meshes, we can also add more RotateTransform3D groups to define  new rotations around different axes. The Axis property specifies the axis that will  rotate according to the value assigned to the Angle property. The previous line uses  a -1, indicating that the axis should rotate -1 * 88 = -88 degrees, which means 88  counterclockwise degrees.  When we want the camera to rotate clockwise, we use 1  positive degrees .  Otherwise, we use -1  negative degrees .  [ 150 ]   Adding transformations to the camera adds flexibility to the possible scenes that can be  rendered from the whole 3D world. The parameters learned so far and the transformations  are represented in the following screenshot:  Chapter 5  Time for action – zooming in and out You want to add zoom in and zoom out capabilities to the camera rotating around the model.  However, there is no zoom property.  Using a perspective camera, we can change the values for many parameters to control it like  a telephoto lens, as explained next:  1.  Stay in the 3DInvadersXBAP project. 2.  Go to the perspective camera's properties. Check the value for Perspective Field of   View  usually 45 degrees by default .   [ 151 ]   Controlling the Cameras: Giving Life to Lights and Actions  3.  Change it to 150 degrees. You will see more models in the scene, but the spaceship  will be shown smaller  further away from the camera , as in the following screenshot:  4.  Now, change it to 75 degrees. You will see fewer models in the scene, but they will   be larger  closer to the camera , as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 152 ]   5.  The Far Clipping Plane value shows the default value of 100. Reduce it slowly,   dragging the mouse over the textbox to the left. As you reduce its value, you will see  that many pieces of the 3D models in the rendered scene begin to disappear  first  the spheres and then the spaceship , as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 5  6.  Restore the Far Clipping Plane value to the default of 100.  [ 153 ]   Controlling the Cameras: Giving Life to Lights and Actions  7.  The Near Clipping Plane value shows the default value of 0.1. Increase it very slowly,  dragging the mouse over the textbox to the right. As you increase its value, you will  see that many pieces of the 3D models in the rendered scene begin to disappear   first the spaceship and then the spheres , as shown in the following screenshot:  8.  Restore the Near Clipping Plane value to the default of 0.1.  What just happened? You changed the perspective field of view, the near clipping plane, and the far clipping plane  values for the perspective camera. You could see what happens when you modify these  values in a rendered 3D scene.  As these parameters are a bit complex, it is very important to experiment with  them and preview the changes.  Now, we are able to translate the camera, rotate it, and change many parameters to show  the desired elements of a 3D world in each rendered scene.  [ 154 ]   Controlling the perspective field of view The perspective field of view for the camera defines the angle for the perspective camera's  lens. A low value for this angle narrows the view. Hence, the models will appear larger in the  visible part of the 3D world, as shown in the following diagram that represents a camera's  lens with a perspective field of a view of 45 degrees:  Chapter 5  A high value for this angle widens the view. Hence, the models appear smaller in the visible  part of the 3D world, as shown in the following diagram that represents a camera's lens with  a perspective field of a view of 90 degrees  compare it with the previous diagram :  450  Perspective  field of view =  450  900  Perspective  field of view =  900  The higher the value of the angle, the wider the rendered view.  We can change the angle for the perspective field of view in the XAML or C code through  the perspective camera's instance FieldOfView property.  Controlling the clipping planes The values for the clipping planes determine how close to or far away from the camera a  3D model can get before it disappears from the rendered view. The part of the 3D world  that is going to be rendered can be represented as a four-sided frustum  generated by the  perspective field of view , the near clipping plane, and the far clipping plane.   [ 155 ]   Controlling the Cameras: Giving Life to Lights and Actions  The following diagram shows a 2D representation of the near clipping plane and the far  clipping plane that define the boundaries for a perspective camera's frustum:  The 3D region, which is visible on the screen, is formed by a clipped pyramid called a frustum.  The near clipping plane and the far clipping plane determine the clips. You can see the 3D  representation and its relation with the perspective field of view in the following diagram:  Near Clipping Plane  NearPlaneDistance   Part of the 3D world rendered in the 2D  screen  Far Clipping Plane  FarPlaneDistance   450  Perspective  field of view =  450  Near Clipping Plane  NearPlaneDistance   +  increase   Y axis  -  reduce   -  reduce   Far Clipping Plane  FarPlaneDistance   Part of the 3D world rendered in the 2D  screen  X axis  +  increase   Perspective field of view  +  increase   Z axis  -  reduce   [ 156 ]   Chapter 5  The near clipping plane controls the position of the plane that slices the top of the pyramid  and determines the nearest part of the 3D world that the camera is going to render in  the 2D screen. The value is expressed taking into account the Z-axis. We can change the  near clipping plane to define the frustum to render in the XAML or C code through the  perspective camera's instance NearPlaneDistance property. Its default value is 0.1.  The far clipping plane controls the position of the plane that slices the back of the pyramid  and determines the more distant part of the 3D world that the camera is going to render  in the 2D screen. The value is expressed taking into account the Z-axis. We can change  the far clipping plane to define the frustum to render in the XAML or C code through the  perspective camera's instance FarPlaneDistance property. Its default value is 100.  The camera's position in the 3D world and its transformations will determine  the final effects of these values. As mentioned earlier, these values can affect  whether or not a model is visible in the rendered view. Hence, it is very  important to work with them when we import 3D models from different DCC  tools with different scales. Sometimes, we cannot see a model rendered because  these values create a frustum that does not include the models in the rendered  view. Therefore, it is very important to understand all the parameters related to  the cameras. The 3D world is more complex than a simple 2D screen.  Time for action – understanding perspective and  orthographic cameras You have to work with a camera that shows the objects with a perspective view, as happens  when watching a scene using an ordinary camera lens. This means that the objects that get  further away from the camera should appear smaller.  Now, we are going to see the difference between a perspective and an orthographic camera:  1..  Stay in the 3DInvadersXBAP project.  [ 157 ]   Controlling the Cameras: Giving Life to Lights and Actions  2.  Go to the perspective camera's properties. Rotate and translate the camera using   the camera's orbit function, as previously explained. The camera should show a  rendered scene, like the one shown in the following screenshot, with the three  spheres and the spaceship being visible. The spaceship appears smaller because   it is further away from the camera.  3.  Go to the perspective camera's properties. Click on the Orthographic Camera button   for the Camera Type property. The Perspective Field of View  FieldOfView   property will be replaced by the Width  Width  property. As an orthographic  camera turns off the perspective view of an ordinary camera, the spaceship will  appear larger, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 15 ]   Chapter 5  4.  Click on the Perspective Camera button for the Camera Type property.  What just happened? You change the camera type used to render the view. It is easy to understand the differences  between the perspective and the orthographic cameras that are viewing the same scene  rendered by just changing the camera type.  When the models get further away from an orthographic camera, they do not appear to get  smaller or distorted because this camera turns off the perspective.  As we want our games to be as realistic as possible, we will use a perspective camera.   The models will get smaller and appear distorted as they get further away from the  perspective camera. We must consider this when working with collision-detection  algorithms, effects, and physics.  It is very important to understand the way a perspective camera works as we will  be trusting in its capabilities to offer a realistic rendered view of our 3D world in  which the models move and interact.  Have a go hero – rotating cameras around a 3D model There is no more time for learning about cameras. It is time for action.  Give a name to the perspective camera  PerspectiveCamera1 . Give names to the  transformations defined for this camera.  Add the C code to the application in order to rotate the camera around the 3D model,   as your project manager showed you in the previous diagram. You will have to translate and  rotate the camera taking into account the elapsed time to provide a smooth animation.  Now, replace the existing keyboard handler with a new one, letting the user move the  camera nearer to the model and further away from it, as the camera goes on rotating   around the 3D model.  Finally, add the possibility to use new keys to let the user change the near and far planes of  the frustum used to render the view.  [ 15 ]   Controlling the Cameras: Giving Life to Lights and Actions  Silverlight and the cameras  So far, we have been controlling cameras in an WPF XBAP application. We used Expression  Blend to interact with a perspective camera's properties and saw the models rendered in  a Viewport3D. Now we want to do this using Silverlight, which does not have an official  support for Viewport3D and its cameras. How can we control cameras on the fly using   real-time rendering in Silverlight 3?   We can do this using the Camera class and its default instance provided by Balder. Everything  we have learned so far about the cameras is also useful when working with Balder's cameras  in Silverlight. We began working with an WPF XBAP application because cameras are indeed  complex components and we could preview the changes as we modified the properties.  Time for action – controlling cameras on the fly Now, your project manager wants to view the spaceship rotating in a Silverlight application.  However, as you have learned about cameras, he wants you to create the rotation effect  through the camera and not by rotating the model.  Luckily, Balder offers a simple Camera class that allows us to control the position and the  target without the need to make complex math calculations:  1.  Open the 3DInvadersSilverlight project. 2.  Open the code for the InvadersGame class. 3.  Add the following lines to define a private variable:     The camera's angle expressed in radians private double _cameraAngleRadians = 0;  4.  Replace the code that defined some properties for Camera in the LoadContent   method with the following:    Define the camera's target  0; -5; 0  Camera.Target.X = 0; Camera.Target.Y = -5; Camera.Target.Z = 0;    Define the stable camera's position in the Y-axis Camera.Position.Y = 35f;  5.  Replace the code for the Update method with the following:     Calculate the new position for the camera in the X-axis Camera.Position.X =  float Math.Sin _cameraAngleRadians  * 50f;    Calculate the new position for the camera in the Z-axis  [ 160 ]   Camera.Position.Z =  float Math.Cos _cameraAngleRadians  * 50f;    Increase the camera's angle expressed in radians _cameraAngleRadians += 0.005;  6.  Build and run the solution. The default web browser will appear showing the  spaceship colored in red. It will be rotating because the camera is changing its  position in the X and Y axis, as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 5  What just happened? Wow! You impressed your project manager. In less than five minutes, you could rotate  the camera to give life to the 3D model with a few lines of code. However, there are many  complex calculations made behind the scenes.  We showed the spaceship rendered in a Balder's viewport and we moved the camera's  position in the X and Y axis. The spaceship appears to be rotating in the screen.  Understanding cameras related to matrixes Balder's camera implements everything we learned about the perspective camera.   However, it hides many properties.  First, we defined the target for the camera  X = 0, Y = -5, and Z = 0  with the following lines:  Camera.Target.X = 0; Camera.Target.Y = -5; Camera.Target.Z = 0;  The target remains stable during the animation. The camera's position in the Y-axis also  remains stable. Therefore, we assigned it the desired value in the LoadContent method:  Camera.Position.Y = 35f;  [ 161 ]   Controlling the Cameras: Giving Life to Lights and Actions  We added some scene-management code in the overridden Update method. The code is  quite simple:  Camera.Position.X =  float Math.Sin _cameraAngleRadians  * 50f; Camera.Position.Z =  float Math.Cos _cameraAngleRadians  * 50f; _cameraAngleRadians += 0.005;  Each time this method is executed, the camera's angle expressed in radians is increased   by 0.005.  The new position for the camera in the X-axis is determined by calculating the sine of the  camera's desired angle, expressed in radians. Then, it is multiplied by 50.  The new position for the camera in the Z-axis is determined calculating the cosine of the  camera's desired angle, expressed in radians. Then, it is multiplied by 50.  Once the new positions are assigned, the new frame is rendered and the view is updated.  The default Up vector defined by Balder's camera is X = 0, Y = 1, and Z = 0. The  camera's instance stores this vector in the Up property. However, it is read-only.  We can indirectly change the camera's Up vector by changing the value of the  Roll property.  Taking into account the Position, Target, and Up properties, Balder uses the default  values to create a perspective field of view and a projection matrix:        Field of view angle: 40 degrees Near plane distance  near clipping plane : 1 Far plane distance  far clipping plane : 1000  It also calculates the definitive Up vector, taking into account the value for the Roll property  and creates a look at the Position, Target, and Up vector using a view matrix.  These matrixes involved many complex calculations that allow Balder to create a perspective  camera capable of rendering a scene without having to worry about the values for the  elements of these matrixes.  The view matrix is available in the ViewMatrix property and the projection matrix in  ProjectionMatrix. However, they are both read-only properties.  Have a go hero – working with many cameras Working with many cameras in Silverlight using Balder is easy. You just have to save the  values for the properties that define the Position, Target, and Roll properties for each  camera and then swap them as needed.  [ 162 ]   Chapter 5  Your project manager wants you to make an animation using three cameras one after   the other.  The first camera has to show the spaceship far away from the camera and then zoom in until  it fills the view. Then, it is time to swap to the second camera.  The second camera has to show the spaceship moving from left to right. Then, it is time to  swap to the third camera.  The third camera has to show the spaceship rotating as previously explained.  You can use a switch statement asking for the number of the active camera and assigning  the properties according to the active camera in the overridden Update method.

Position, UpVector, and Roll.  Summary  We learned a lot in this chapter about 3D cameras. Specifically, we changed the values for  their most important properties and learned about their effects in a rendered 3D view. We  performed transformations to the cameras. We translated and rotated them as needed in  XBAP WPF using XAML and in Silverlight applications using the services provided by Balder.  We prepared the cameras according to the needs of our scene and controlled them in real  time. We also learned about the different kinds of cameras and how to control the part of  the 3D world rendered in the 2D screen.  Now that we've learned to define and control 3D cameras for our games, we're ready   to control input devices to provide great feedback to the action in the games, which is   the topic of the next chapter.  [ 164 ]   6  Controlling Input Devices   to Provide Great Feedback  In order to create attractive games, we must understand how input devices work.  Only then will we be able to offer the players the ability to control many aspects  of their gaming using the most exciting gaming input devices. Most players do  not want to be limited to the keyboard and mouse when playing games. Hence,  we must be able to communicate with gamepads, joysticks, and steering wheels,  and other input devices to offer a more complete gaming experience.   In this chapter, we will learn everything we need to know about the most widely used  gaming input devices. We will be able to read values from them in order to control many  aspects of our games. By reading it and following the exercises we shall:            Understand how to work with the most exciting gaming input devices Reduce the gaming input devices' complexity to buttons and axes Work with analog and digital controls Control cameras using gaming input devices Read many simultaneous values and react to them with synchronized actions   Controlling Input Devices to Provide Great Feedback  Giving life to the game!  So far, we have been working with 2D sprites, 3D models, cameras, scenes, and game loops.  We were able to control cameras in order to give life to simple scenes, in both an XBAP  WPF application and in Silverlight. However, most modern computer games do not use the  keyboard as the main input device. They use gamepads, joysticks, flightsticks, steering  wheels, a mouse, and other input devices in order to allow the player to control many  aspects of the game. How can we interact with these gaming input devices to provide the  player with a realistic and comfortable gaming experience?  In order to communicate with these gaming input devices, we need to talk to hardware  drivers. This can be difficult when working with applications running in a web browser. The  biggest problem is the security. Thus, we will have to use some tricks in order to allow the  player to use these gaming input devices.  Most game fans have at least one gamepad. Therefore, it is a great idea to offer  the player the possibility to use it in order to control the game. We are talking  about Windows compatible gamepads. They offer Windows drivers and they  allow us to interact with them from our games. However, there are some console  gamepads that are not compatible with Windows.  Time for action – creating a keyboard manager class Your project manager wants you to go back to the Invaders 2D game that you had submitted  to the game contest website. Many players reported bugs and said that they could not use a  gamepad to play the game. Remember that it was the most desired game.  The code that checks the keyboard is taking into account just one pressed key. It is time to  create a keyboard manager class. It must be able to track multiple keys pressed by the user  between each rendered frame:  1.	 Open the SilverlightInvaders2DVector project. 2.	 Create a new class—KeyboardManager. 3.	 Add the following line of code at the beginning of the class definition  as we are    going to use the System.Collections.Generic.List class : using System.Collections.Generic;  [ 166 ]   Chapter 6  4.	 Add the following private and static variables:     The list of pressed keys private static List  _keys = new List   ;    The list of keys to remove private static List  _keysToRemove = new List   ;    The target for the the event handlers private static UserControl _target;  5.	 Add the following constructor with a parameter to the KeyboardManager class:  public KeyboardManager UserControl target  {   _target = target;      Add a KeyEventHandler to control the keys that are pressed         down    _target.KeyDown += new KeyEventHandler OnKeyDown ;      Add a KeyEventHandler to control the keys that are released        up    _target.KeyUp += new KeyEventHandler OnKeyUp ; }  6.	 Add the following public and static methods to allow some control for the    lists of keys: public static void RemoveUpKeys   {      Remove the keys that were released  up    for  int i = 0; i < _keysToRemove.Count; i++    {     _keys.Remove _keysToRemove[i] ;   } } public static void ClearPressedKeys   {   _keys.Clear  ;   _keysToRemove.Clear  ; }  7.	 Add the following public and static function to check for a keypress:  public static bool IsKeyDown Key keyToTest  {   return  _keys.Contains keyToTest  ; }  [ 167 ]   Controlling Input Devices to Provide Great Feedback  8.	 Add the following private delegates to control the keys that are pressed    and released:  private void OnKeyDown Object sender, KeyEventArgs e  {      Add the key to the list of pressed keys    _keys.Add e.Key ; } private void OnKeyUp Object sender, KeyEventArgs e  {      Add the key to the list of keys to remove   _keysToRemove.Add e.Key ; }  What just happened? The code to take information from the keyboard is now held in the new KeyboardManager  class. It uses some static private variables because there is just one keyboard connected  to a computer. Thus, we will need just one instance of this class.  The class is quite easy to understand. The constructor receives a UserControl as a  parameter and it adds two event handlers to control the keys that are pressed  KeyDown   and released  KeyUp .  The player can press many keys before we check the keys that are pressed in the game  loop. The class is capable of keeping a list of pressed keys. We need that because we want  the player to be capable of pressing many keys at the same time. For example, the player  can press the up and right arrow at the same time to move the ship in the X and Y axis at  the same time. We were not able to do that with our simple keyboard management code  programmed in the events.  Using the keyboard Using the keyboard for gaming purposes in Silverlight applications is a bit complex, because  we have to add code to the events in order to capture the pressed and released keys. Hence,  we created a class to do that work for us.  Remember that we have to keep the code simple and efficient, because  it is going to be run in the main game loop.  [ 16 ]   Chapter 6  We do not want to add the code to handle the keyboard in the events. Instead, the keyboard  manager uses the KeyDown and KeyUp event handlers to work with two static and   private lists:      _keys: The list of pressed keys _keysToRemove: The list of keys to remove.  They were pressed and now,   they are not.   In the game loop, we can call the IsKeyDown static function to determine whether a key  was pressed or not. As the keys that were pressed are kept in a list, we can call this function  for many different keys.  Once we have processed the pressed keys, we can call the RemoveUpKeys static   method. It removes the keys that were released, using a simple for loop, as shown   in the following lines:  for  int i = 0; i < _keysToRemove.Count; i++  {   _keys.Remove _keysToRemove[i] ; }  We decide when to call this method because we must first process the keys that were  pressed. We cannot remove the keys in the attached KeyUp event handler because it would  not let us check the keys that were pressed. Once the action occurs, if the key is not pressed  anymore, the user will have to press that key again. However, if the key is still pressed when  the main game loop checks for the pressed keys the next time, a new action based on this  key will be triggered. Thus, we will be able to offer the player smooth character movement.  Time for action – programming the input control  in the game loop Now, it is time to make the necessary changes to the game loop in order to use our new  keyboard manager:  1.	 Stay in the SilverlightInvaders2DVector project. 2.	 Open the code for the superclass SpriteWrapper.  [ 16 ]   Controlling Input Devices to Provide Great Feedback  3.	 Replace the public methods GoUp, GoDown, GoLeft, and GoRight with the   following public methods to allow each key to change the speed for an   independent axis: public void GoUp   {   _speed.Y = -_incrementY;     _speed.X = 0; } public void GoDown   {   _speed.Y = _incrementY;     _speed.X = 0; } public void GoLeft   {   _speed.X = -_incrementX;     _speed.Y = 0; } public void GoRight   {   _speed.X = _incrementX;     _speed.Y = 0; }  We just commented the lines that assigned a 0 to the axis that did not move.  Thus, we will be able to call the GoUp and then the GoRight methods and  the sprite will move up and right at the same time.  4.	 Add the following public method to stop moving the sprite:  public void GoNowhere   {   _speed.Y = 0;   _speed.X = 0; }  5.	 Open MainPage.xaml.cs. 6.	 Add the following private variable in the public partial class MainPage   : UserControl, to hold an instance of the KeyboardManager class: private KeyboardManager _keyboardManager;  [ 170 ]   Chapter 6  7.	 Add the following private method to check the pressed keys using the   new keyboard manager and to move the ship according to them. private void CheckKeyboard   {      By default, the ship will not move if there is no key down   _ship.GoNowhere  ;   if  KeyboardManager.IsKeyDown Key.Left       _ship.GoLeft  ;   if  KeyboardManager.IsKeyDown Key.Right       _ship.GoRight  ;   if  KeyboardManager.IsKeyDown Key.Up       _ship.GoUp  ;   if  KeyboardManager.IsKeyDown Key.Down       _ship.GoDown  ;      After checking the down keys, remove the up keys   KeyboardManager.RemoveUpKeys  ; }  8.	 Add the following line of code after the line CheckCollisions  ; and before   the line _LastTick = DateTime.Now; in the RenderFrame method: CheckKeyboard  ;  9.	 Comment the code in the Page_KeyDown event handler  the keyboard manager    is going to do that job .  10.	 Comment the line that added an EventHandler to check for each key down in the    event handler for the btnStartGame button's Click event:   this.KeyDown += new KeyEventHandler Page_KeyDown ;  11.	 Now, add the following line of code before the end of the previously    mentioned event: _keyboardManager = new KeyboardManager this ;  [ 171 ]   Controlling Input Devices to Provide Great Feedback  12.	 Build and run the solution. Click on the button and move the ship towards the  aliens, using diagonal movements  up & left; down & left; up & right or down &  right . Keep the keys pressed for a few seconds and then release them. You will be  able to move and stop the ship with great accuracy, using the keyboard, as shown   in the following picture:  What just happened? You could move the ship using the cursor movement keys. You could control the ship's  movements. The ship moves when the keys are held down and it stops moving when  the keys are released. However, as the game loop is called so many times per second,  sometimes, it is difficult to move the ship in a diagonal direction. We will make a remedy   for this using a gamepad to control the ship.  First, we made some changes to the methods that controlled the ship's movement in  SpriteWrapper. We wanted to have more control over the ship.  When the player clicks on the start button, a new instance of KeyboardManager is created.  This is necessary to tell the class the UserControl:  _keyboardManager = new KeyboardManager this ;  [ 172 ]   Chapter 6  The constructor will add the event handlers to this UserControl in order to identify the  pressed and released keys.  We added a call to the new CheckKeyboard procedure in the RenderFrame method.   We made some changes, taking into account the possibilities offered by our new   keyboard manager.  The ship does not move if there is no key held down. We achieve this calling the GoNowhere  method before evaluating the keys that are pressed:  _ship.GoNowhere  ;  Then, we evaluate the keys that are down, using the static IsKeyDown function. We are  able to evaluate multiple keys at the same time. This gives us the possibility to respond to  complex keyboard inputs using this keyboard manager.  As previously explained, once we have processed the pressed keys, we call the  RemoveUpKeys static method:  KeyboardManager.RemoveUpKeys  ;  Therefore, when the RenderFrame method is called again, the keyboard handler will inform  the method of the keys that are still held down and will not hold keys that have already  been released. This way, we make sure that the ship moves when the keys are down. It is  very important to translate this behavior to other input devices mapped to a keyboard, like  gamepads, joysticks, and flightsticks.  Time for action – mapping a gamepad to the keyboard Your project manager brings you a new USB gamepad, similar to the one used by Sony  Playstation 3 game console. He wants to control the Invaders 2D game using the gamepad's  right mini stick.  We cannot use DirectX to access DirectInput in Silverlight. We cannot access  the gamepad driver either. Therefore, we have to use a feature provided by  most gamepad drivers, the keyboard and mouse mode.  [ 173 ]   Controlling Input Devices to Provide Great Feedback  We have to configure the gamepad driver to map four gamepad keys to the keyboard's  cursor movement keys:  You need a USB gamepad with 4 axis and 2 mini sticks in order to complete  the following exercises.  1.	 Connect the USB gamepad to the computer and install its driver if you have    not already done so.  2.	 Go to Control Panel  Game Controllers. Select the gamepad in the game controllers    list and click on Properties  some drivers show the generic name USB Network  Joystick . A dialog box will show the buttons for the gamepad, the mini sticks  axis, and the point of view hat, as shown in the following screenshot:  3.	 Disable the analog mode  the analog mode led should be turned off . The gamepad    must be in digital mode in order to allow us to map the right mini stick to   keyboard's keys.  4.	 You can test the relationship between the button numbers shown in the screen and    the gamepad's pressed buttons using the previously mentioned dialog box.  [ 174 ]   Chapter 6  5.	 Click on Keyboard & Mouse Setting. A new dialog box will appear. It will allow you    to change the gamepad mode and map its buttons to keyboard's keys.  6.	 Activate the checkbox Keyboard & Mouse Mode. 7.	 Select the following values for the first four keys  you must select the Keyboard  Key… option in the combo box and then press the desired key on the keyboard   dialog box :          Key 1: Up Arrow Key 2: Right Arrow Key 3: Down Arrow Key 4: Left Arrow  8.	 The values should be similar to the ones shown in the following picture:  9.	 Click on OK. 10.	 Move the gamepad's left mini stick. The mouse pointer should change its position    as the mini stick moves.  11.	 Control the gamepad's POV. The mouse pointer should change its position as    it is pressed in different directions.  [ 175 ]   Controlling Input Devices to Provide Great Feedback  12.	 Open a text file in Notepad. Move the gamepad's right mini stick. It    should work as the cursor movement keys.  13.	 Press the gamepad's four-action buttons  on the right side . They should work    as the cursor movement keys.  What just happened? You configured the gamepad driver to map its mini sticks and four-action buttons to the  mouse pointer and the cursor movement keys. Therefore, you will be able to control your  Silverlight game using the gamepad without problems.  This is not the most convenient way to use a gamepad in a game. However, as  Silverlight has limitations, we can configure gamepads as previously explained  and we will be able to use them in our games. The same technique can be used  for joysticks and flightsticks.  Understanding the gamepad as an input device The gamepad is a complex input device. It usually offers many action buttons and two mini  sticks, as shown in the following picture  top view :  [ 176 ]   Each button number can be assigned to represent a different key on the keyboard. Thus, we  can take advantage of the 12 action buttons in this kind of gamepad.  Chapter 6  The action buttons 11 and 12 are triggered when the player pushes the mini stick   like clicking with a mouse button .  The other four action buttons are visible in the following picture  rear view :  Depending on the manufacturer and the model, its four action buttons on the right side can  show different symbols or numbers, as shown in the following diagram:  [ 177 ]   Controlling Input Devices to Provide Great Feedback  Time for action – using the gamepad Now, it is time to invite your project manager to control the game using the gamepad in a  Silverlight application:  1.	 Stay in the SilverlightInvaders2DVector project. 2.	 Build and run the solution. Click on the button and move the ship to the aliens, using   the right mini stick. You will be able to move and stop the ship with great accuracy,   using the gamepad, as shown in the following picture:  3.	 Now, use the gamepad's four action buttons to control the ship's movement.  [ 17 ]   Chapter 6  What just happened? Many Silverlight developers had told your project manager that it was impossible to use a  gamepad to control a Silverlight application. For this reason, he is delighted to see that the  Silverlight games you are creating can use a gamepad.  We did not have to change a single line of code. Firstly, we had to take the input from a  keyboard, taking into account that many keys could be pressed during the time taken to  render one frame. Then, mapping the gaming input device to keys, we could use it in a  Silverlight application, without even needing to know its model or manufacturer.  This technique has its limitations, because we do not have access to  the gaming input device's driver. For example, we cannot activate the  vibration effect, if available in the device.  Time for action – creating a mouse manager class Now, your project manager wants to use the left mini stick to move the ship. As it controls  the mouse pointer, you can take into account its position to allow a player to use the left  mini stick in a Silverlight application.  It is time to create a simple yet useful mouse manager class. It must be able to track the left  button and the mouse pointer's position between each rendered frame:  As Silverlight runs on both Windows and Mac OS X, it allows us to know the state  for the left mouse button. Mac computers do not have a right mouse button.  Besides, Silverlight applications can run on Linux through the Moonlight project:  http:  www.mono-project.com Moonlight  1.	 Stay in the SilverlightInvaders2DVector project. 2.	 Create a new class—MouseManager. 3.	 Add the following private and static variables:    The target for the the event handlers private static UserControl _target;    The mouse's left button state private static bool _mouseButton;    The mouse position, represented by a Point private static Point _mousePoint = new Point 0,0 ;  [ 17 ]   Controlling Input Devices to Provide Great Feedback  4.	 Add the following constructor with a parameter to the MouseManager class:  public MouseManager UserControl target  {   _target = target;      Add a KeyEventHandler to control when the button is down   _target.MouseLeftButtonDown += new                               MouseButtonEventHandler OnMouseDown ;      Add a KeyEventHandler to control when the button is up   _target.MouseLeftButtonUp += new                                MouseButtonEventHandler OnMouseUp ;      Add a KeyEventHandler to control the mouse movement   _target.MouseMove += new MouseEventHandler OnMouseMove ; }  5.	 Add the following public and static function to check the mouse button state    and the pointer's position: public static bool IsButtonDown   {   return  _mouseButton ; } public static Point GetMousePosition   {   return  _mousePoint ; }  6.	 Add the following private delegates to control the mouse movement and the    button that is pressed and released: private void OnMouseDown Object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e  {    mouseButton = true; } private void OnMouseUp Object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e  {   _mouseButton = false; } private void OnMouseMove Object sender, MouseEventArgs e  {   _mousePoint = e.GetPosition null ; }  [ 10 ]   Chapter 6  What just happened? The code to take information from the mouse is now held in the new MouseManager class.  It uses some static private variables because there is just one mouse connected to a  computer. Thus, we will need just one instance of this class.  The class is similar to the one used to take information from the keyboard. The constructor  receives a UserControl as a parameter and it adds three event handlers to handle the  mouse movement  OnMouseMove  and the left button that is pressed  OnMouseDown  and  released  OnMouseUp .  Using the mouse Using the mouse for gaming purposes in Silverlight applications has some limitations. We  already mentioned that we are limited to checking for the left button. Besides, the mouse  pointer's movement is limited to the UI Element area used in the web browser to display   the game's scenes. Thus, we will not have the same precision offered by the keyboard.  As we have to add code to the events in order to capture the mouse movement and the  pressed and released button, we created a class to do that work for us.  We do not want to add the code to handle the mouse in the events. Instead, the mouse  manager uses the OnMouseMove, OnMouseDown, and OnMouseUp event handlers to save  the results in two private and static variables:      _mouseButton: A bool value indicating whether the left button is pressed or not. _mousePoint: The mouse pointer's last position.  In the game loop, we can call the GetMousePosition static function to trigger actions  according to the new mouse pointer location. Besides, we can call the IsButtonDown  static function to determine whether the left button was pressed or not.  Time for action – using the mouse manager in the game loop Now, it is time to make the necessary changes to the game loop in order to use our   new mouse manager. We will deactivate the keyboard manager and replace it with the   mouse manager:  1.	 Stay in the SilverlightInvaders2DVector project. 2.	 Open MainPage.xaml.cs.  [ 11 ]   Controlling Input Devices to Provide Great Feedback  3.	 Add the following private variables in the public partial class MainPage :  UserControl, to hold an instance of the MouseManager class and the previous   mouse position: private MouseManager _mouseManager; private Point oldMousePoint = new Point 0,0 ;  4.	 Add the following private method to check the mouse movement using the new    mouse manager and to move the ship according to the vectors. private void CheckMouse   {      By default, the ship will not move if there is no mouse       activity   _ship.GoNowhere  ;   Point mousePoint = MouseManager.GetMousePosition  ;      Move the ship when the button is down   if  mousePoint.X < oldMousePoint.X      _ship.GoLeft  ;   if  mousePoint.X > oldMousePoint.X      _ship.GoRight  ;   if  mousePoint.Y < oldMousePoint.Y      _ship.GoUp  ;   if  mousePoint.Y > oldMousePoint.Y      _ship.GoDown  ;   if  MouseManager.IsButtonDown      {     _ship.GoNowhere  ;   }      Save the old mouse position   oldMousePoint = mousePoint; }  5.	 Comment the line CheckKeyboard  ;  this time, we are just going to use the   mouse . Then, add the following line of code after the line CheckCollisions  ;  and before the line _LastTick = DateTime.Now; in the RenderFrame method:   CheckKeyboard  ; CheckMouse  ;  6.	 Now, add the following line of code before the end of the btnStartGame    button's Click event: _mouseManager = new MouseManager this ;  [ 12 ]   7.	 Build and run the solution. Click on the button and move the mouse. You will see   that the ship moves in the same direction that the mouse pointer translates. You will  be limited by the area where the mouse pointer can be moved, as shown in the   following picture:  Chapter 6  What just happened? You can move the ship using the mouse. You can control the ship's movements, limited  to the area available for the mouse pointer's location. The ship moves when the mouse  moves in certain directions and it stops moving when the left button is pressed or when the  mouse stops moving. It is very easy to move the ship in a diagonal direction and with a free  movement style.  When the player clicks on the start button, a new instance of MouseManager is created. This  is necessary to tell the class the UserControl:  _mouseManager = new MouseManager this ;  The constructor will add the three previously explained event handlers to this UserControl.  We commented the call to the CheckKeyboard procedure and we added a call to the new  CheckMouse procedure in the RenderFrame method.  We evaluate the direction of the mouse pointer taking into account its previous position   and comparing it with the new one. We are able to evaluate directions in both axes at the  same time.  [ 13 ]   Controlling Input Devices to Provide Great Feedback  The ship does not move if the mouse left button is pressed. We achieved this by calling the  GoNowhere method before evaluating the button's status:  if  MouseManager.IsButtonDown    {   _ship.GoNowhere  ; }  Time for action – using the gamepad as a mouse Now, it is time to invite your project manager to control the game using the gamepad's left  mini stick in a Silverlight application:  1.	 Stay in the SilverlightInvaders2DVector project. 2.	 Keep the same configuration previously explained for the gamepad. 3.	 Build and run the solution. Click on the button and move the ship to the aliens,   using the left mini stick. You will be able to move and stop the ship according to the  mouse pointer's position, using the gamepad, as shown in the following picture:  4.	 Repeat the experience using the gamepad's POV control to move the ship.  [ 14 ]   Chapter 6  What just happened? By using the keyboard manager, the mouse manager, and configuring the gamepad's driver,  you could take into account its input to control a game running as a Silverlight application.  Again, we did not have to change a single line of code. Firstly, we had to take the input from  the mouse, taking into account its movement during the time taken to render one frame.  Then, mapping one of the gaming input device's analog controls to the mouse; we could use   it in a Silverlight application, without even needing to know its model or manufacturer.  Time for action – rotating cameras using input devices As you were able to use a gamepad in Silverlight, your project manager wants to control the  camera that shows the ship using this device.  Now, we are going to add the keyboard and mouse management classes to our application  that shows the spaceship, using Balder and Silverlight:  1.	 Open the project, 3DInvadersSilverlight. 2.	 Copy and paste the previously created keyboard and mouse management classes to    the main project, KeyboardManager and MouseManager.  3.	 Open MainPage.xaml.cs. 4.	 Add the following private variables in the public partial  class MainPage : UserControl, to hold instances of the  KeyboardManager and MouseManager classes: private KeyboardManager _keyboardManager; private MouseManager _mouseManager;  5.	 Add the following line of code before the end of the aforementioned    class's constructor:    Key manager _keyboardManager = new KeyboardManager this ;    Mouse manager _mouseManager = new MouseManager this ;  6.	 Open InvadersGame.cs. 7.	 Add the following private variables in the public class   InvadersGame : Game, to hold the previous mouse position: private Point oldMousePoint = new Point 0,0 ;  [ 15 ]   Controlling Input Devices to Provide Great Feedback  8.	 Add the following private methods to change the camera's angle:  private void ReduceCameraAngle    {   _cameraAngleRadians -= 0.1; } private void IncreaseCameraAngle   {   _cameraAngleRadians += 0.1; }  9.	 Add the following private methods to check the mouse movement and the   keys pressed using the new mouse and keyboard manager. They control the   camera's angle: private void CheckMouse   {   Point mousePoint = MouseManager.GetMousePosition  ;      Move the spaceship when the button is down   if  mousePoint.X < oldMousePoint.X      ReduceCameraAngle  ;   if  mousePoint.X > oldMousePoint.X      IncreaseCameraAngle  ;      Save the old mouse position   oldMousePoint = mousePoint; } private void CheckKeyboard   {   if  KeyboardManager.IsKeyDown Key.Left       ReduceCameraAngle  ;   if  KeyboardManager.IsKeyDown Key.Right       IncreaseCameraAngle  ;      After checking the down keys, remove the up keys   KeyboardManager.RemoveUpKeys  ; }  10.	 Replace the code in the Update method with the following.  We want to control the   camera's angle using both the keyboard and the mouse while the light rotates. : base.Update  ; CheckKeyboard  ; CheckMouse  ;    Calculate the new position for the camera in the X-axis Camera.Position.X =  float Math.Sin _cameraAngleRadians  * 50f;  [ 16 ]   Chapter 6     Calculate the new position for the camera in the Z-axis Camera.Position.Z =  float Math.Cos _cameraAngleRadians  * 50f; _light.Position.X = - float Math.Sin _lightAngleRadians  * 20f; _light.Position.Z = - float Math.Cos _lightAngleRadians  * 20f; _lightAngleRadians += 0.05;  11.	 Build and run the solution. Click on the web browser's viewport to activate its   focus. Move the mouse left and right. You will see that the camera that targets   the spaceship rotates as the mouse is moved. Use the cursor movement keys   to control the camera.  12.	 Keep the same configuration that was previously explained for the gamepad. 13.	 Rotate the camera using the left mini stick  left and right . You can also rotate the   camera using the two action buttons mapped to the left and to the right cursor  movement keys. The following picture shows the left mini stick controlling   the camera.  [ 17 ]   Controlling Input Devices to Provide Great Feedback  What just happened? By using the keyboard manager, the mouse manager, and configuring the gamepad's driver,  you could take into account its input to control a camera using Balder under Silverlight.  We did not have to change our manager classes. We just had to add some code to create the  instances in the MainPage class.  We created methods very similar to the ones already explained for our previous examples.  However, this time we were back in a 3D scene.  Using the same manager classes, we can control as many aspects  of a game as desired.  Have a go hero – taking full advantage of the gamepad You have a gamepad with 12 action buttons in your hand. You must take full advantage of  this gamepad in the games you are working on. Make the following changes to the XBAP  WPF and the Silverlight version of the 3D games. Use the keyboard and mouse management  classes to achieve these goals.  Use the gamepad's select button to switch between three cameras:        Top view Front view Rear view  They must target to the spaceship from the aforementioned views.  Use the gamepad's left and right pair of buttons  check the gamepad's rear view  to rotate  the spaceship 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees.  Use the left mini stick to rotate the camera.  Use the four action buttons  right mini stick in digital mode  to move the spaceship in the   3D scene.  Bridging with DirectInput capabilities  So far, we have been mapping a gamepad and other gaming input devices to keyboard's keys  and the mouse pointer. Our keyboard and mouse managers allowed us to take the inputs  provided by these devices. Thus, we were able to use just their most essential features.  However, we could not take full advantage of them. Silverlight does not allow us to access   [ 1 ]   DirectX. However, we can change some security settings to allow an XBAP WPF application  to use DirectInput and take full advantage of exciting input gaming devices, such as steering  wheels. How can we interact with DirectInput in order to control these gaming input devices?  Chapter 6  In order to communicate with DirectX in an XBAP WPF application, we must  change some default security settings. This is not a recommended practice,  because we will introduce some security risks. However, we can use it when  we are deploying applications on a trusted Intranet or Extranet.  Time for action – installing the necessary SDKs We have to work with DirectX for managed code. Thus, we must make sure that we have the  necessary SDKs installed.  XNA Framework replaced DirectX for managed code. However, we are  only using it to access DirectInput's features.  1.	 Download the DirectX Software Development Kit  SDK . The download   link for the kit is http:  www.microsoft.com downloads details. aspx?FamilyID=24a541d6-0486-4453-8641-1eee9e21b282&displaylang= en—file name: DXSDK_Mar09.exe. This SDK includes the set of DirectX DLLs that   are required to run DirectX applications.  2.	 Run the installer and follow the steps to complete the installation wizard. 3.	 Once the installation of the DirectX SDK has finished, you will be able to use the   references included in the .NET Framework to access DirectX functions in   C  managed code , as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 1 ]   Controlling Input Devices to Provide Great Feedback  What just happened? Now, we will be working with an XBAP WPF application. As mentioned earlier, it uses the  complete .NET Framework. Therefore, we already have .NET installed. We needed the  DirectX libraries to access DirectX for managed code.  We are not going to use XNA Framework because we want to access more gaming input  devices than the ones supported by XNA.  Considering deployment's additional requirements There is a small issue with the deployment of applications that use DirectX for managed  code. The stand-alone developer run-time installers install only the DirectX developer and  debug run-time for redistribution purposes.  However, the user that needs to use our new XBAP WPF application will need to install the  full set, including the managed code version.  In order to install these additional libraries, you have to run the DirectX redistributable  installer using the following command-line parameter:  DXSetup.exe  InstallManagedDX  Using the  InstallManagedDX flag, DirectX setup routine will  install the managed run-times. We need them in order to access  DirectX from our application.  Time for action – understanding sticks and buttons Using DirectInput, you can take control of most gaming input devices that you can connect to  a modern PC through USB. Some input devices look pretty complex. However, they are just a  smart combination of sticks  analog axes  and buttons.  Therefore, the first step to understanding the gaming input device is checking the sticks and  buttons offered. We followed a similar step for the gamepad, but now we are going to pay  special attention to the functions offered by a steering wheel.  1.	 Connect the USB steering to the computer and install its driver if you have not    done so.  2.	 Go to Control Panel  Game Controllers. Select the wheel in the game controllers   list and click on Properties  some drivers show the generic name USB Vibration  Wheel . A dialog box will show the buttons for the steering wheel, the axis  controlled by the wheel and the point of view hat, as shown in the following picture:  [ 10 ]   Chapter 6  3.	 Move the steering wheel and watch the X-axis changing its value. 4.	 Accelerate  right pedal  and watch the Y-axis increasing its value. 5.	 Brake  left pedal  and watch the Y-axis reducing its value. 6.	 Test the relationship between the button numbers shown in the screen and   the wheel's pressed buttons using the previously mentioned dialog box.  7.	  If the wheel offers a shift control, use it and you will see the button numbers  representing each shift. In this example, button 11 represents shift up and   button 12 represents shift down.  What just happened? Using the driver's dialog box, you could discover how a steering wheel or other gaming input  device sends its analog and digital values to its driver.  This information will help us to use DirectInput's capabilities.  [ 11 ]   Controlling Input Devices to Provide Great Feedback  Understanding the steering wheel as an input device The steering wheel is a complex input device. It usually offers many action buttons and  it controls two axes  X and Y . The steering wheel movement controls the X-axis and the  accelerate and brake pedal control the negative and positive values for the Y-axis, as shown  in the following picture:  [ 12 ]   Chapter 6  Depending on the manufacturer and the model, the number of  action buttons on the wheel could be different.  Time for action – testing the input devices with  a DirectInput wrapper DirectInput offers a complex API. You do not want to learn the complete API because you just  want to use the steering wheel in your XBAP WPF game.  There is a simple yet powerful wrapper for joystick style devices, developed in C by Mark  Harris. We can use it to obtain values from the steering wheel. There is an example Windows  Forms application that can help us to understand how to work with this wrapper.  1.	 Download the source code for the C Joystick wrapper from its page in THE  CODE PROJECT website, http:  www.codeproject.com KB directx  joystick.aspx. The compressed file is joystick-src.zip.  The source code is available as part of the code that can be downloaded for  this book. However, in order to publish code for your new applications that  use this wrapper, you must keep the copyright notice and the credit to the  original author, Mark Harris.  2.	 Decompress the previously mentioned file. 3.	 Open the JoystickSample solution.  [ 13 ]   Controlling Input Devices to Provide Great Feedback  4.	 Now, you have to change a setting in Visual Studio to allow the application to get  a device list without throwing a LoaderLock exception. Select Debug  Exceptions  and a dialog box will appear. Expand Managed Debugging Assistants under the  list Break when an exception is. Uncheck Thrown for LoaderLock and click OK.  This way, you will be able to debug the application. See the following screenshot:  5.	 Build and run the solution. A new window will appear showing sliders to present the   current values of the different axes and radio buttons to display the status for the  button. Move the gaming input device's axis, press and release its buttons, and   see how the application shows these changes in real-time, as shown in the   following screenshot:  [ 14 ]   Chapter 6  What just happened? The application established a communication with the gaming input device driver and could  retrieve the position of each axis and status of each button.  The buttons have a boolean status.  The joystick wrapper used in the application shows values for each axis using a two bytes  unsigned integer. Hence, the value goes from 0 to 65,535. The value 32,767 represents the  central or neutral position.  It is very important to test whether the center of each analog axis is calibrated  in order to avoid getting incorrect values from the gaming input device.  Understanding the analog axis for a steering wheel The screen can show up to 6 axis. The following table shows the usual names:  Name shown in the screen label Axis: 1 Axis: 2 Axis: 3 Axis: 4 Axis: 5 Axis: 6  Property name AxisA AxisB AxisC AxisD AxisE AxisF  Technical name Rz Rx X Y Extra Axis 1 Extra Axis 2  Considering the aforementioned table and the usage of a steering wheel, when the player:          Moves the steering wheel right, the value of X-axis  AxisC  increases  >= 32,767 .  The values from 32,768 to 65,535 represent the right. Moves the steering wheel left, the value of X-axis  AxisC  decreases  <= 32,767 .  The values from 0 to 32,766 represent the left. Keeps the steering wheel at the center, the value of X-axis  AxisC  is equal   to 32,767. Accelerates  pushes the right pedal , the value of Y-axis  AxisD  decreases    <= 32,767 . The values from 0 to 32,766 mean acceleration. This is the inverse  of the previously experienced behavior shown by the driver user interface. The  problem is that the accelerator and brake work against the same axis. Therefore,  using this wrapper, the values will decrease when accelerating and increase   when braking.  [ 15 ]   Controlling Input Devices to Provide Great Feedback      Brakes  pushes the left pedal , the value of Y-axis  AxisD  increases  >= 32,767 .  The values from 32,768 to 65,535 means braking. Again, this is the inverse of the  previously experienced behavior shown by the driver user interface. Neither accelerates nor brakes, the Y-axis value  AxisC  is equal to 32,767.  Understanding the analog axis for a gamepad If we want to work with a two mini sticks gamepad, we can replace the default mapping for  the Joystick class with a new mapping.  In the update method, change the following line:  axisB = state.Rx;  With this line:  axisB = state.Z;  Thus, the AxisB property  representing the axisB field  will be mapped to the Z-axis, which  is controlled by the right mini stick's horizontal movement.  Considering the aforementioned change and the usage of a gamepad with two mini sticks,  when the player:    Moves the left mini stick:  To the right, the value of X-axis  AxisC  increases  >= 32,767 . The  values from 32,768 to 65,535 represent right. To the left, the value of X-axis  AxisC  decreases  <= 32,767 . The  values from 0 to 32,766 represent left. Down, the value of Y-axis  AxisD  increases  >= 32,767 . The values  from 32,768 to 65,535 represent down. Up, the value of Y-axis  AxisD  decreases  <= 32,767 . The values  from 0 to 32,766 represent up. Keeps this stick at the center, the values of X-axis  AxisC  and the  Y-axis  AxisD  are both equal to 32,767.    Moves the right mini stick:  Down, the value of Rz-axis  AxisA  increases  >= 32,767 . The  values from 32,768 to 65,535 represent down. Up, the value of Rz-axis  AxisA  decreases  <= 32,767 . The values  from 0 to 32,766 represent up.                [ 16 ]   Chapter 6        Right, the value of Z-axis  AxisB  increases  >= 32,767 . The values  from 32,768 to 65,535 represent right. Left, the value of Z-axis  AxisB  decreases  <= 32,767 . The values  from 0 to 32766 represent left. Keeps this stick at the center, the values of Z-axis  AxisB  and the  Rz-axis  AxisA  are both equal to 32,767.  As we are working with analog modes, the values for the different axes change  proportionally to the movement made by the player. Thus, we can offer a very  precise control over many aspects of the game.  Besides, the gamepad's analog mode allows us to take independent inputs from both mini  sticks and the main four action buttons.  Time for action – adapting a joystick manager class It is time to adapt the wrapper for joystick style devices in order to use it in our   XBAP WPF application.  By default, Visual Studio configures an XBAP WPF application to run as a  partial trust application. We are going to change that in order to have access  to DirectInput. However, this is not a recommended practice. You should only  use it when working with other security resources as certificates.  1.	 Open the 3DInvadersXBAP project. 2.	 Select Project  Add Reference… and select Microsoft.DirectX.DirectInput.    3.	 Now, the project will list the reference to the aforementioned DLL in the    Then, click on OK.

Click on the Security tab and then activate the radio button This is a full trust  application. Now, we will be able to access DirectInput and to use the joystick   wrapper from our XBAP WPF application.  6.	 Create a new class—Joystick.  [ 17 ]   Controlling Input Devices to Provide Great Feedback  7.	 Add the following lines of code at the beginning of the class definition:  using Microsoft.DirectX.DirectInput; using System.Diagnostics;  8.	 Do not forget to make the previously explained changes if you are planning to take    input from a gamepad with two mini sticks.  9.	 Copy and paste the code for the Joystick class from the JoystickSample   solution, from the constructor to the end of the class's methods. Do not include   the previous namespace as we are changing it.  10.	 Find and comment the following line  we are not going to use Windows Forms and    we do not want to work with window handles :   private IntPtr hWnd;  11.	 Comment the existing constructor's definition:    public Joystick IntPtr window_handle   12.	 Replace the previously mentioned constructor's definition with the following,    without parameters: public Joystick    13.	 Find and comment the first line in the constructor's code:     hWnd = window_handle;  14.	 Find and comment the following line in the FindJoysticks method:    joystickDevice.SetCooperativeLevel hWnd,     CooperativeLevelFlags.Background      CooperativeLevelFlags.NonExclusive ;  15.	 Find and comment the following line in the AcquireJoystick method:    joystickDevice.SetCooperativeLevel hWnd,     CooperativeLevelFlags.Background      CooperativeLevelFlags.NonExclusive ;  [ 1 ]   16.	 If you are using Visual Studio Standard or better, right-click on Joystick.cs  the new   class  in the Solution Explorer and select View Class Diagram from the context  menu that appears. The class diagram will show you the fields, properties and   methods for this joystick wrapper:  Chapter 6  What just happened? You have a new Joystick class ready to use in your XBAP WPF application. Now, you are  able to add code in order to read values from the steering wheel.  We had to change the security settings for the XBAP WPF application. This was necessary in  order to have access to DirectInput and the gaming input device drivers.  [ 1 ]   Controlling Input Devices to Provide Great Feedback  We made some changes to the class to avoid the usage of a window handle. The class was  originally developed to be used in Windows Forms applications. We are using it in an XBAP  WPF application and we had to make these changes to adapt it to the new environment.  The class is very simple. It offers us many properties to get the values for the available axes  and buttons. The methods allow us to control the desired device and to update the values.  Time for action – using the steering wheel in the game loop Now, it is time to create a simple game loop for our XBAP WPF application and to make the  necessary changes to it in order to use our new joystick manager. This time, we will use it to  read values from the steering wheel:  1.	 Stay in the 3DInvadersXBAP project. 2.	 Open Page1.xaml.cs. 3.	 Add the following private variables in the public partial class Page1 :   Page, to hold an instance of the Joystick class and the last time a frame finished   its rendering:    Holds the time when the method finished rendering a frame private DateTime _LastTick;    The instance of the Joystick class to access the wrapper private Joystick _joystick;  4.	 Add the following lines of code before the end of the Page constructor:     Grab the joystick _joystick = new Joystick  ;    Obtain the list of joystick style game input devices found string[] sticks = _joystick.FindJoysticks  ;    Acquire the main joystick _joystick.AcquireJoystick sticks[0] ;    Save the current time _LastTick = DateTime.Now;    Add an EventHandler to render each frame CompositionTarget.Rendering += RenderFrame;  5.	 Add the following private method to check the steering wheel movement and   its buttons' states using the new Joystick class and to move and rotate the ship   according to them. private void CheckJoystick   {      Update the joystick status  [ 200 ]   Chapter 6    _joystick.UpdateStatus  ;      Shift up = move forward   if  _joystick.Buttons[10] == true      translateShip.OffsetX += 0.05f;      Shift down = move back   if  _joystick.Buttons[11] == true      translateShip.OffsetX -= 0.05f;      Rotate the ship according to the axis values   rotateShip.Angle =   _joystick.AxisC   65535f  * 360 ;   rotateShipY.Angle =   _joystick.AxisD   65535f  * 360 ; }  6.	 Now, add the following lines of code to program the event handler that will render   each frame and update the spaceship's position and rotation according to the   input read from the steering wheel: private void RenderFrame object sender, EventArgs e  {      Hold the elapsed time after the last call to this method   TimeSpan elapsedTime =  DateTime.Now - _LastTick ;   CheckJoystick  ;      Save the current time   _LastTick = DateTime.Now; }  7.	 Build and run the solution. Move the steering wheel left and right and you will see  the spaceship rotating taking into account both the wheel's direction and position,   as shown in the following picture:  [ 201 ]   Controlling Input Devices to Provide Great Feedback  8.	 Play with the acceleration and brake pedals. The spaceship will rotate in the Y-axis    according to the values read from this pedals.  9.	 Shift up  button 11  to move forward the ship. Shift down  button 12  to move    back the ship.  What just happened? Awesome! Your project manager can see the ship moving according to the steering   wheel's position.  Using the joystick wrapper and adding a game loop to the XBAP WPF application, you could  take into account its input to control a game running as a full trust XBAP WPF application.  We added a game loop because our XBAP WPF application did not have one. It is very similar  to the game loops used in previous Silverlight applications.  Using the joystick manager Firstly, we had to grab the joystick, obtain a list of joystick style game input devices and then  acquire the main one. We used the Joystick class and its methods to achieve these goals.  The FindJoysticks function returns a string array with the joystick style game input  devices found. Using this method, we can discover the available devices.  Then, calling the AcquireJoystick method and sending as a parameter the string that  represents the desired input device to acquire, we could take control of the main device:  _joystick = new Joystick  ; string[] sticks = _joystick.FindJoysticks  ; _joystick.AcquireJoystick sticks[0] ;  In this case, we were considering that the only input game device connected to the  computer is the steering wheel, to keep things simple.  Once we acquired the input device, the work was done in the CheckJoystick method. The  Joystick class offers two properties to recognize the input device features:    AxisCount: The number of available axes  Buttons.Count  : The number of buttons. Buttons is an array of bool values, counting its  members we can know the number of available buttons.  In the CheckJoystick method, the first thing done was to update the input device status,  calling the UpdateStatus method:  _joystick.UpdateStatus  ;  [ 202 ]   Chapter 6  This method updates the values for the axis and the buttons properties to reflect the  changes in the previously acquired input device.  Then, we were able to check the values for the corresponding properties and we translated  and rotated the spaceship according to them.  The Buttons array's lower bound is 0. Therefore, in order to check the bool value for the  button number 11, we used Buttons[10]. A true value means that the button is pressed.  We checked for buttons number 11 and 12 and translated the spaceship according to   their states:  if  _joystick.Buttons[10] == true      translateShip.OffsetX += 0.05f; if  _joystick.Buttons[11] == true      translateShip.OffsetX -= 0.05f;  The steering wheel movement affects the AxisC property as previously explained. We took  into account the value that ranges from 0 to 65535 to create a 360 degrees rotation:  rotateShip.Angle =   _joystick.AxisC   65535f  * 360 ;  We also rotated the spaceship in its Y axis taking into account the acceleration and brake  pedals that affect the AxisD property, creating a 360 degrees rotation:  rotateShipY.Angle =   _joystick.AxisD   65535f  * 360 ;  You can control any aspect of the game checking the values for the available  axes and buttons.  Working with many input devices Sometimes, we need to work with many joystick style game input devices at the same time.  For example, we can work with two gamepads, one flightstick and a gamepad, one steering  wheel and two gamepads, etc.  We can do this using the Joystick class analyzing the strings returned when calling its  FindJoysticks function. Then, we can call the AcquireJoystick method for each  gaming input device that we need to control. We need one instance of the Joystick   class per device.  [ 203 ]   Controlling Input Devices to Provide Great Feedback  Using other input devices We can use the same principles explained for the steering wheel to take full advantage of the  features offered by a gamepad, joystick, flightstick, and any other input gaming devices that  provide a certain number of buttons and digital and or analog sticks.  The only difference will be the features reported by each device and the experience provided  to the player.  When using DirectInput in an XBAP WPF application, it is convenient  to deactivate the keyboard and mouse mode for the gamepad or other  gaming input devices. We can take full advantage of their analog modes.  Have a go hero – using the Wiimote You can use the most exciting input gaming devices, such as the amazing Nintendo's  Wiimote, adapting existing wrappers to an XBAP WPF application, as we did for the  Joystick class.  There is a managed library to use the Wiimote in Windows with the C code, developed   by Brian Peek  http:  www.brianpeek.com . You can download it from   http:  wiimotelib.codeplex.com .  Your project manager wants you to control the spaceship using a Wiimote. You have to adapt  this wrapper to use it in the game and change the game loop to take the values from the  Wiimote. It must move and rotate the ship as we did for the steering wheel.  Have a go hero – working with time, analog and digital values Your project manager is delighted with the steering wheel that controls the spaceship. The  game loop used in the XBAP WPF application takes into account the elapsed time between  each rendered frame. However, this value is not used to bring more precision to the  movements and rotations.  You have already worked with 2D games taking into account the elapsed time. Now, it is time  to do this in the 3D games.  Offer the player the possibility to translate the spaceship and rotate it taking into account  the values from the gaming input devices and the elapse time.  Then, accelerate and decelerate the spaceship's speed according to the values read from  analog inputs.  Use an object-oriented design to provide these new features to the spaceship.  [ 204 ]   Finally, use the acceleration and deceleration algorithms for the camera's movement in   both the Silverlight and the XBAP WPF application. In the Silverlight version, use the analog  values from the mouse position and add the code to take into account the elapsed time in  the Game class.

[ 205 ]   Controlling Input Devices to Provide Great Feedback  Summary  We have learned a lot in this chapter about gaming input devices. Specifically, we were able  to understand how they work and learnt how to read values for their keys, buttons, and  axis. We performed transformations to the models and cameras, translating and rotating  them according to the values read from the input devices in Silverlight applications and in  XBAP WPF using DirectInput, managers, and wrappers. We also understood the differences  between analog and digital controls.  Now that we've learnt to control many aspects of our games using input devices, we're ready  to use effects and textures to amaze the players, which is the topic of the next chapter.  [ 206 ]   7  Using Effects and Textures to Amaze  In order to create realistic games, we must render scenes that project a genuine  environment to the players. If we want to show a spaceship in a game, it will  have to be similar to a real spaceship. Hence, we have to paint our models  using textures and we must use different kinds of lights to illuminate them and  to create amazing environments and effects. We must mix 2D images with 3D  models. In this chapter, we will learn everything we need to know about the  process of enveloping a 3D model using textures.  We will be able to take 3D elements from popular and professional 3D DCC tools and we will  show them rendered in real-time on the screen with different textures, and enlightened by  many lights. In this chapter, we shall:            Prepare the 3D elements to be enveloped by textures Take advantage of 3D DCC tools to create 3D models with texture   mapping coordinates Understand how to work with many different complex textures Control lights to give life to the scenes Work with lights to create our first special effects  Dressing characters using textures  So far, we have been working with 3D scenes showing 3D models without textures. We were  able to show and to control a 3D model and many cameras using different input devices, in  both an XBAP WPF application and in Silverlight. However, we did not consider the original  texture used to envelope the spaceship. Thus, the spaceship does not look as nice as  expected. How can we envelope 3D models using textures to amaze the player?   Using Effects and Textures to Amaze  In order to envelope 3D models using textures, we need to export the model from the   3D DCC tool including the references to the images used as textures. Then, we will be   able to replace the image used as a texture with another one.  Whilst working with 2D games, changing colors was a nice technique to create  new characters and to draw the players in to new stages, reusing existing sprites  and backgrounds. We can use a similar technique to create new characters and  scenarios for 3D games by changing the textures that envelope a 3D model.  Time for action – adding textures in DCC tools The 3D digital artists are facing difficulties in creating additional spaceship models. However,  using two or three models and displaying them with many different textures will enable the  player to choose between a dozen spaceships. Your project manager wants you to use the  same technique used in the 2D games to create additional characters without putting in a  huge effort.  First, we are going to open the spaceship model in Blender, add a texture based on a PNG  image and export the 3D model to the ASE format, compatible with Balder. These steps are  necessary because we must export the ASE format including a bitmap texture definition  enveloping the meshes. Later, we will be able to replace this bitmap texture definition.  1.	 Start Blender and open the spaceship model  previously saved in Blender's native   format as Ship01.blend in C:\Silverlight3D\Invaders3D\3DModels\ SPACESHIP01 .  2.	 Select Panels  Shading  Material.  You will see the Shading panel displaying the   Material buttons.   3.	 Select the first material listed in the Link to Object combo box, under Link to Object.   In this case, the first material is MA:Material.001.  The spaceship is a complex model, previously imported into Blender from a  DirectX .x format. Thus, we are going to assign a bitmap texture to an existing  material to envelope the meshes. The spaceship model contains definitions for  seven materials. In this case, we are just going to change the first one.  4.	 Now, click on the Add New button in the Texture panel. Blender will assign the   name Tex to the new texture, as shown in the following picture:  [ 20 ]   Chapter 7  5.	 Select Panels  Shading  Texture. You will see the Shading panel displaying the   Texture buttons.  6.	 Click on Texture Type and select Image. Blender will add a new panel, Image. 7.	 Click on the Load button, select the PNG file to be used as a texture to envelope the  meshes. You can use Ship_06.PNG in the Textures folder or you can use another  texture like Bricks.PNG  downloaded from http:  www.freefoto.com  . You  just need to add a reference to a bitmap file. Then, click on Select Image. The Preview  panel will show a small bitmap's thumbnail, as shown in the following picture:  [ 20 ]   Using Effects and Textures to Amaze  8.	 Select Panels  Shading  Material. You will see the Shading panel displaying the  Material buttons and a preview for the material using the recently loaded bitmap   as a texture to envelope the meshes, as shown in the following screenshot:  9.	 Save the model in Blender's native format. It will be useful for further format  conversions. Select File  Save…. Browse to the folder created to hold the new  models  C:\Silverlight3D\Invaders3D\3DModels\SPACESHIP01  and  enter the desired name—Ship01_texture01.blend. Then, click on Save As. The  model is available to be loaded in Blender without the need to follow the previously  mentioned steps.  10.	Now, you have to export the model to the ASE format with the reference to the  texture. Therefore, select File  Export  ASCII Scene  .ase  v0.6.10. The default  folder will be the same used in the previous step. Hence, you will not need to  browse to another folder. Enter the desired name— Ship01_texture01.ase.  Then, click on Export ASCII Scene. A dialog box will appear.  11.	Click on Selection only to deselect this option. 12.	Click on OK. Now, the model is available as an ASE 3D model with the reference to  the texture. You will have to change the absolute path for the bitmap that defines  the texture in order to allow Balder to load the model in a Silverlight application.  What just happened? We used a 3D DCC tool  Blender  to add a texture based on a bitmap and link it to an existing  material to envelope the meshes. Then, we converted the 3D model to the ASE file format,  using the Goofos ASE export script.  If we open the ASE file using a text editor, we will recognize the bitmap filename used for the  texture, included with its full path, as shown in the following lines:  *MATERIAL 0 {   *MATERIAL_NAME "Multi  Material.001"   MATERIAL_CLASS "Multi Sub-Object"   *MATERIAL_AMBIENT 0.0000   0.0000   0.0000   *MATERIAL_DIFFUSE 0.7843   0.7843   0.7843  [ 210 ]   Chapter 7    *MATERIAL_SPECULAR 1.0000   1.0000   1.0000   *MATERIAL_SHINE 0.5000   MATERIAL_SHINESTRENGTH 0.0978   *MATERIAL_TRANSPARENCY 0.0000   *MATERIAL_WIRESIZE 1.0000   *NUMSUBMTLS 7   *SUBMATERIAL 0 {     *MATERIAL_NAME "Material.001"     *MATERIAL_CLASS "Standard"     *MATERIAL_AMBIENT 0.0000   0.0000   0.0000     *MATERIAL_DIFFUSE 0.7843   0.7843   0.7843     *MATERIAL_SPECULAR 1.0000   1.0000   1.0000     *MATERIAL_SHINE 0.5000     *MATERIAL_SHINESTRENGTH 0.0978     *MATERIAL_TRANSPARENCY 0.0000     *MATERIAL_WIRESIZE 1.0000     *MATERIAL_SHADING Blinn     *MATERIAL_XP_FALLOFF 0.0000     *MATERIAL_SELFILLUM 0.0000     *MATERIAL_FALLOFF In     *MATERIAL_XP_TYPE Filter     *MAP_DIFFUSE {       *MAP_NAME "Tex.001"       *MAP_CLASS "Bitmap"       *MAP_SUBNO 1       *MAP_AMOUNT 1.0000       *BITMAP "C:\Silverlight3D\Invaders3D\3DModels\SPACESHIP01                \Textures\Bricks.png"  These lines of code define the first material, Multi  Material.001, composed of seven  sub-materials.  The first sub-material is Material.001 and it includes a bitmap texture. The full path and  the PNG filename for the bitmap texture is referenced in the line that begins with *BITMAP.  We do not need to be experts in the ASE format. However, it is important  to understand the changes generated in the exported model.  [ 211 ]   Using Effects and Textures to Amaze  Time for action – exporting 3D models from DCC tools  to Silverlight Now, we are going to display the ASE 3D model, exported from Blender in a Silverlight  application with help of Balder, using an image texture:  1.	 Open the 3DInvadersSilverlight project. 2.	 Right-click on the Assets folder and select Add  Existing item… from the context    menu that appears.  3.	 Go to the folder in which you saved the new 3D model, including the link to the    texture, in the ASE format  C:\Silverlight3D\Invaders3D\3DModels\ SPACESHIP01 . Select the new ASE file  Ship01_texture01.ase    and click on Add.  4.	 Click on the ASE file added in the previous step. Change its Build Action property    to Resource.  5.	 Right-click on the Assets folder and select Add  Existing item… from the context   menu that appears. Now, you are going to add the bitmap to use as a texture.  6.	 Go to the folder in which you saved the PNG to use as a texture     C:\Silverlight3D\Invaders3D\3DModels\SPACESHIP01\ Textures . Select the bricks image file  Bricks.PNG  and click on Add.  7.	 Open the code for the recently added ASE file  Ship01_texture01.ase . 8.	 Search the line that begins with *BITMAP. 9.	 Replace the full path and the filename that follows the *BITMAP    C:\Silverlight3D\Invaders3D\3DModels\SPACESHIP01\ Textures\Bricks.png  with the desired PNG bitmap, Bricks.png.  10.	 Now, open the code for the class InvadersGame. 11.	 Replace the line of code that loaded the spaceship mesh in the LoadContent    method with the following: _ship = ContentManager.Load  "ship01_texture01.ase" ;  [ 212 ]   12.	 Build and run the solution. The default web browser will appear showing the   spaceship enveloped with a bricks texture, as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 7  13.	 Click on the web browser's viewport to activate its focus. Move the mouse left   and right. You will see that the camera that targets the spaceship rotates as  the mouse is moved. Use the cursor movement keys to control the camera.  What just happened? Wow! A spaceship made of bricks was rendered in the web browser. Your project manager is  amazed with the possibility to use different textures to envelope existing   3D models.  We showed the new spaceship with a texture rendered in a Balder's viewport. We had to  replace the existing reference to a bitmap in the ASE file with a simple image filename. Thus,  we could load and render a 3D model, previously exported from a 3D DCC tool, using a PNG  bitmap to envelope it.  Displaying a 3D model using textures in a 2D screen with  Silverlight Once we have the model in the ASE file format with a material linking to an image texture,  the steps to load and show a 3D model using a texture to envelope it are the following:  1.  Add the new ASE model to the Assets folder. It must be built as a Resource. 2.  Open the code for the ASE file and replace the full paths and the filenames that   follows the *BITMAP prefixes with the desired filenames without paths.  [ 213 ]   Using Effects and Textures to Amaze  3.  Add the necessary PNG files  the image textures  to the Assets folder. They are   built as Resources by default.  4.  Override the game class's LoadContent method to load the model, creating a new   mesh using the ContentManager, as done in the following line: _ship = ContentManager.Load  "ship01_texture01.ase" ;  5.  Add the new mesh to the scene using the AddNode method:  6.  Override the game class's Update method to manage the scene, the cameras, the   Scene.AddNode _ship ;  lights and the meshes.  This time, we did not follow the last two steps because we were working on an existing  solution that showed the spaceship's previous version without textures.  We can see the difference between the spaceship without textures  the previous version   and the new spaceship, with textures  made of bricks , in the following picture:  Time for action – enveloping 3D models The spaceship made of bricks is nice. However, it is difficult to believe that it could fly.  It is time to envelope the spaceship using the original texture. It is a very complex texture  that envelopes the model and gives life to the spaceship. We can see the plain image for the  texture Ship_06.PNG in the following screenshot:  [ 214 ]   Chapter 7  The image seems to be wrong. However, as it will envelope the spaceship, it will work as a  plain piece of paper enveloping a spaceship handcrafted in wood.  1.	 Stay in the 3DInvadersSilverlight project. 2.	 Right-click on the Assets folder and select Add  Existing item… from the context  menu that appears. Now, you are going to add the new bitmap to use as a texture.  3.	 Go to the folder in which you saved the original PNG to use as a texture for the   spaceship  C:\Silverlight3D\Invaders3D\3DModels\SPACESHIP01\ Textures . Select the original texture image file  Ship_06.png  and click on Add.  4.	 Open the code for the ASE file added in the previous exercise     Ship01_texture01.ase .  5.	 Search for the line that begins with *BITMAP.  [ 215 ]   Using Effects and Textures to Amaze  6.	 Replace the existing filename that follows the *BITMAP  Bricks.png  with the new    desired PNG bitmap, "Ship_06.png".  7.	 Build and run the solution. The default web browser will appear showing the   spaceship enveloped with the original texture, as shown in the following screenshot:  8.	 Move the camera as previously explained to understand how the complex    texture envelopes the 3D model.  What just happened? Now, you can see a nice spaceship rendered in real-time on the web browser. It does not  look as nice as the original model rendered using the DirectX Viewer because Balder uses  software rendering.  We could use a very complex texture to envelope a 3D model. We had to replace the  previous reference to a bitmap in the ASE file with the new desired texture.  [ 216 ]   Chapter 7  Understanding textures We can use textures to paint and envelope the different faces offered by a 3D model. Balder  allows us to use a bitmap PNG to envelope a 3D model using its real-time software rendering  capabilities. However, in order to use complex textures as the one used in the previous  exercise, the 3D digital artist uses the 3D DCC tool to define the texture's coordinates.  We can also define the texture coordinates manually with code. However, our main goal is to  take 3D models from the DCC tools and export them in the necessary formats in order to use  them in our games. Therefore, we use the capabilities offered by the 3D DCC tool to define  the texture's coordinates.  As the spaceship we are using was created as a DirectX .x 3D model, the digital artist  designed a complex texture and defined its coordinates to envelope the model using   the 3D DCC tool.  If we want to predict the results of using a texture to envelope a 3D model, we  can define the texture in the 3D DCC tool and make the necessary changes to  the texture mapping coordinates. Once the texture envelopes the model as  expected, we can then translate the model and its texture using the real-time  software rendering capabilities offered by Balder in Silverlight.  Repeating textures as tiles A very common technique is to create images that can be repeated as tiles. Thus, we can use  them as if they were bigger textures, as done with the spaceship made of bricks.  In the following picture, we can see a pattern of diamond tiles:  This image and other amazing textures can be downloaded from Spiral Graphics website   www.spiralgraphics.biz .  [ 217 ]   Using Effects and Textures to Amaze  Using this texture as tiles to envelope a 3D model, the rendering process will use as many  tiles as necessary to paint the meshe's faces. For example, the following picture shows a  bigger texture created using 9 tiles  3X3 :  It seems to be a bigger texture. However, this is an illusion created using tiles.  Time for action – replacing textures So far, the application is showing just one spaceship. Your project manager wants to test   the possibility of allowing a two-player mode. He wants you to add a new spaceship using  the same texture to envelope the new model, but with a different color.  1.	 Stay in the 3DInvadersSilverlight project. 2.	 Go to the folder in which you have saved the original PNG to use as a texture for  the spaceship  C:\Silverlight3D\Invaders3D\3DModels\SPACESHIP01\ Textures . Make a copy of the original texture image file  Ship_06.PNG    and name it Ship_07.PNG.  [ 21 ]   3.	 Open the previously mentioned image file in a photo editing application like GIMP   or Photoshop. Replace its colors manipulating the colors balance, as shown   in the following picture:  Chapter 7  4.	 Save the changes. 5.	 Create a copy of the ASE file with the reference to the texture     Ship01_texture01.ase  and name it Ship01_texture02.ase.  [ 21 ]   Using Effects and Textures to Amaze  Ship_07.PNG.  folder, as a Resource.  6.	 Make a copy of the original texture image file  Ship_06.PNG  and name it    7.	 Add the new ASE file  Ship01_texture02.ase  to the project in the Assets    8.	 Add the new texture image file  Ship_07.PNG  to the project in the Assets folder. 9.	 Open the code for the new ASE file added  Ship01_texture02.ase . 10.	 Search for the line that begins with *BITMAP. 11.	 Replace the existing filename that follows the *BITMAP  Ship_06.png  with the    new desired PNG bitmap—Ship_07.png.  12.	 Now, open the code for the InvadersGame class. 13.	 Add the following lines to define a new private variable:     The second spaceship's mesh private Mesh _ship2;  14.	 Add the following lines of code to load the new spaceship mesh in the   LoadContent method, after the lines that load the first spaceship:    Load and add the second spaceship _ship2 = ContentManager.Load  "ship01_texture02.ase" ; Scene.AddNode _ship2 ;    Set the initial X position for the second spaceship _ship2.Position.X = 10;  15.	 Build and run the solution. The default web browser will appear showing two   spaceships enveloped with different textures, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 220 ]   Chapter 7  What just happened? You can see two spaceships enveloped by different textures rendered in real-time in the   web browser.  The grey ship is on the left and the red one is on the right.  We made small changes to the texture image file and then we created a new model, linked  to this new texture.  As we wanted to show both spaceships, we added a private variable to hold the new Mesh  instance  _ship2 . We added the necessary code to load the model into a Mesh instance  and then we changed the value for the X field of the Position Vector. We did this in  order to show the new spaceship on the right:  _ship2 = ContentManager.Load  "ship01_texture02.ase" ; Scene.AddNode _ship2 ; _ship2.Position.X = 10;  It is very easy to add new models on the scene and to change their  positions. We just have to change the values for the X, Y, and Z fields  of the Position property.  Have a go hero – playing with textures The spaceships look nice. However, your project manager wants to use textures that are  more colorful.  Using the existing textures as a baseline, create new textures for the spaceships and use  them in the game.  Create a new sphere with a low polygon count using a 3D DCC tool. Envelope it using  different textures to create many planets: The Earth, Mars, and Jupiter. Add the spheres   to the scene with the different textures.  Let the player control the two ships using the keyboard and a gamepad.  Then, add the Moon, the Sun and a few starts. Always use 3D models because you are  working with a 3D scene.  Do you dare to create a 3D representation of the solar system in action in a web browser  using Balder and Silverlight?  [ 221 ]   Using Effects and Textures to Amaze  Displaying lights, shadows, materials, and textures  So far, we have been enveloping 3D models using different textures based on bitmap images.  We were able to create new characters by just replacing the texture linked to the 3D model  definition. However, textures are not alone. Many lights, shadows, and other different kind  of materials are also going to be a part of our complex 3D scenes, rendered in real-time. How  do the lights affect an existing scene composed of many 3D models painted using different  kind of materials instead of textures? How can we interact with lights to see the different  generated shadows? How can we learn the differences between the diverse classes of lights?  We can play with lights, shadows, materials, and textures watching the results  of the change being made in real-time using Expression Blend to work with the  components of our 3D scene in an XBAP WPF application.  Time for action – working with lights and  understanding shadows Your project manager wants you to create the effect of a distant explosion changing the color  of the scene's light.  We have to experiment with the parameters of the PointLight automatically created by  the XAML exporter. It will allow us to create the desired effect.  1.	 Open the project 3DInvadersXBAP in Expression Blend. 2.	 Click on the Viewport3D under Objects and Timeline and expand all its children.  Select [PointLight] and go to its Properties tab. Give it a name, MainLight.  3.	 Click on Color and use the editor to change it from white to a dark blue. All the    models in the screenshot will be colored blue:  [ 222 ]   Chapter 7  4.	 Click on the light bulb on the viewport and drag it to different positions in the scene.    You will see how the position of a point light changes  as shown in the following   picture  the blues for the different models:  [ 223 ]   Using Effects and Textures to Amaze  5.	 Change the values for the following properties using 0.1 steps:        ConstantAttenuation LinearAttenuation QuadraticAttenuation.  6.	 Follow the changes in the XAML code. 7.	 Click on Color and use the editor to change it from dark blue to white, its original    value. The models will recover their original colors.  What just happened? You could control the colors shown by all the models in the scene by changing the color  emitted by the point light.  This point light  MainLight  is the only light instance in this Viewport3D. When this light is  white, the models that receive the light rays show the colors defined in their materials. They  produce shadows and gradients. However, the base colors are not modified.  However, when this point light changes its color from white to any other tone, it affects  the colors shown by the models. This happens in real scenes with real lights. The rendering  process considers the light sources and uses them to create a 2D screen from the 3D world.  Therefore, when we changed the point light's color to blue, the models were shown using  blue tones.  Thus, changing the lights' colors, we can create amazing effects on the models that receive  these lights.  The simplest way to understand how lights work, is watching their effects over  the models in a scene in real-time. Whilst changing the lights' parameters, we  can understand how they interact with the materials and the textures. Besides,  we are able to see the shadows.  We can define additional lights using XAML or creating the instances using C code. We can  also add transformations to lights, as shown in the XAML code that defines MainLight:  <PointLight x:Name="MainLight" Color="FFFFFFFF"              Position="4.076245,1.005454,5.903862"             LinearAttenuation="0.033333352406831"             Range="1.7976931348623157E+308">                            [ 224 ]   Chapter 7       <TranslateTransform3D OffsetX="7.827" OffsetY="-2.375"                             OffsetZ="-11.118" >              Understanding different kinds of lights In an XBAP WPF application, we can use four different kinds of lights. Again, changing  their properties is the best way to understand them. However, we can get an idea of their  differences by looking at the following picture:       Ambient light  AmbientLight : It casts light in all directions. Thus, it lights all the  models in the scene evenly. Directional light  DirectionalLight : It casts light in a specific direction. It is  similar to sunlight. In Balder this is referred to as DirectionalLight.  [ 225 ]   Using Effects and Textures to Amaze      Point light  PointLight : It casts light from a single point in all directions. It is  similar to the real light bulbs. It is also known as Omni light  omnidirectional light .  In Balder this is referred to as OmniLight. Spot light  SpotLight : It casts light using the shape of a cone. Thus, only the  models that fall inside the cone will be affected by this kind of light. It is similar   to the spot lights used in theaters.  Have a go hero – creating effects using lights Combining the different kinds of lights, their colors, positions, rotations, and parameters,  create the following effects in both the XBAP WPF application and in Silverlight:  Balder provides only two light styles. Therefore, you will be able to create more  effects using the XBAP WPF application.          An explosion A flash A sunrise A nightfall  Combine the lights with a new 3D model, add the ability for the player to shoot laser beams  from one ship to the other. A light has to illuminate the laser beam while it moves from the  origin to the destination. Do not forget to take into account the elapsed time to control the  positions for the laser beam and the lights.  Pop quiz – working with textures, materials, and lights  1.

[ 227 ]   Using Effects and Textures to Amaze  Summary  We have learnt a lot in this chapter about textures and lights. Specifically, we were able to  understand how they work and learned how to prepare the 3D models to be enveloped  by textures. We replaced the textures used to envelope different 3D models and we took  advantage of Expression Blend to interact with different kinds of lights in a 3D scene. We   also understood the possibilities offered by textures and lights to create amazing effects.  Now that we've learnt how to use textures and how to work with many different kinds of  lights, we're ready to animate 3D characters, which is the topic of the next chapter.  [ 22 ]     Animating 3D Characters  In order to emulate real-life situations in our games, we must animate our 3D  characters in real-time. If we want to show a UFO in a game, it will have to fly  like a real UFO, changing its position and rotating at the same time. Hence,  we have to add animation capabilities to our models and we must combine  the capabilities offered by the cameras with the possibilities to perform  transformations to many models on each frame. The camera shows us a part  of the whole 3D world in which the 3D models must move, rotate, and scale,  creating amazing effects for the player.  By reading this chapter and following the exercises we shall learn how to:            Move 3D characters in the 3D scenes Define specific independent behaviors for the 3D characters that compose the   3D world Understand how to perform different transformations to a 3D model at the   same time Control many transformations over the three axes of a 3D model Animate complex 3D models based on bones and skeletons   Animating 3D Characters  Invaders 3D  So far, we have been working with 3D scenes showing 3D models with textures and different  kinds of lights. We were able to envelope 3D models with textures and create amazing  effects using lights. We moved the 3D models and cameras, translating and rotating them  according to the values read from the input devices. However, we did not animate the 3D  models in Silverlight applications. Games require dozens of 3D models performing different  kinds of animations concurrently. Thus, we have to move and rotate our 3D characters  to create realistic and attractive games. How can we animate multiple independent and  concurrent 3D characters while managing a complex game loop in Silverlight?  We can do this by combining a good object-oriented design with the power of Balder. Using   the same principles learned for raster and vector sprites, it is possible to create flexible and  easy-to-animate 3D characters.  The key to success is reducing the complexity of the mathematics involved in  moving and rotating 3D models using Balder's simple functions.  Time for action – adding a UFO The 3D digital artists created a model of a UFO  Unidentified Flying Object . They  downloaded another model in DirectX .x format from XNA Fusion's website  http:  www. xnafusion.com . They made some changes to a round shield model to create a nice UFO.  The link for the round shield preview is http:  www.xnafusion.com ?p=66, and the  link for downloading the compressed file with the model and the textures is http:  www. xnafusion.com wp-content uploads 2008 04 round_shield.zip.  The original 3D model, called Round_shield, was created by Skonk  e-mail:  skonk@xnafusion.com . You are free to use, modify, and share the content  provided due credit is given to the author.  The UFO is one of the enemies. The aliens want to use this kind of spaceship to invade  Earth. The game must show an UFO moving around and rotating while it changes its  position. Surprisingly, your project leader wants you to use an UFO made of bricks. It is a bit  unrealistic, but this is what he wants.  First, we are going to open the UFO model in Blender, add a texture based on a PNG image  and export the 3D model to the ASE format, compatible with Balder.  [ 230 ]   1.	 Start Blender and open the UFO model, previously saved by the   3D digital artists in Blender's native format as Ufo01.blend in   C:\Silverlight3D\Invaders3D\3DModels\UFO01 .  2.	 Assign a bitmap texture to an existing material to envelope the meshes that shape    the UFO. You already learned the detailed steps for this process.  Chapter 8  The 3D digital artists had to rotate and scale the original DirectX .X model to  shape the UFO. The UFO model contains definitions for five materials. In this  case, you just need to change the first one.  3.	 Use the bricks texture  Bricks.PNG  to envelope the meshes. The Preview panel    will show a small bitmap's thumbnail, as shown in the following picture:  4.	 Save the changes. 5.	 Export it to the ASE format  UFO01.ase . 6.	 Open the project, 3DInvadersSilverlight. 7.	 Add the previously exported ASE file  UFO01.ase  to the Assets folder. 8.	 Replace the full path and the file name for the texture in the ASE file with the   desired PNG bitmap, "Bricks.png". You added this bitmap to   the project when you first learned to work with textures.  [ 231 ]   Animating 3D Characters  What just happened? We prepared the model to use a texture based on an image, exported it to the ASE file  format and added it to the project changing its texture.  The UFO model is now ready to be loaded and rendered, using Blender.  Time for action – creating a new game superclass to  generalize time management capabilities So far, our Silverlight game does not handle the elapsed time between each rendered frame.  We need this information in order to create animations that consider time as a variable.  We are going to create a new abstract superclass to add time management capabilities to  the basic Game  Balder.Core.Game  class provided by Balder:  1.	 Stay in the 3DInvadersSilverlight project. 2.	 Create a new class—RealTimeGame  a subclass of Game —using the    following declaration: public abstract class RealTimeGame : Game  3.	 Add the following line of code at the beginning  as we are inheriting from Balder's    Game class : using Balder.Core;  4.	 Add the following private variables and one property to handle the ticks and    the elapsed time between each rendered frame:    Holds the time when the method finished rendering a frame protected DateTime _lastTick;    Holds the elapsed time after the last call to the Update method protected TimeSpan _elapsedTime; public TimeSpan ElapsedTime {   get { return _elapsedTime; } }  5.	 Add the following public abstract method to encapsulate updates based on the    elapsed time  previously saved on _elapsedTime : public abstract void UpdateWithTime  ;  6.	 Override the Loaded method to save the current time for the first time:  public override void Loaded   {  [ 232 ]   Chapter 8    base.Loaded  ;      Save the current time   _lastTick = DateTime.Now; }  7.	 Override the Update method to calculate and save the elapsed time and save the    new time after updating the game: public override void Update   {   base.Update  ;      Hold the elapsed time after the last call to this method   _elapsedTime =  DateTime.Now - _lastTick ;   UpdateWithTime  ;      Save the current time   _lastTick = DateTime.Now; }  What just happened? The code to define a game that handles the elapsed time between each rendered frame is  now held in the new RealTimeGame class  a subclass of Game . As it is an abstract class,  we will have to create new subclasses inheriting from RealTimeGame to specialize the  behavior of our game.  Once the models are loaded, the game runs the code added in the Loaded method. The  code will save the current time. This will be the first value for the _lastTick variable.  Then, the engine will call the Update method for each frame. Therefore, we had to override  this method to calculate and save the elapsed time in the _elapsedTime variable. Then, it  calls the abstract UpdateWithTime method. This way, we make sure that the code written  in this method in the subclasses will have access to a value in the _elapsedTime variable  and in the ElapsedTime read-only property. Once the UpdateWithTime method finishes  its execution, we save the current time in the _lastTick variable.  Time for action – specializing a game superclass Now, we can specialize RealTimeGame instead of using subclasses of Game. This requires  a small change to the code. We have to override the UpdateWithTime method instead of  overriding the Update method. Besides, we have to remove the line base.Update  ; used  in the Update method. These changes will allow us to animate 3D characters taking into  account the elapsed time.  1.	 Stay in the 3DInvadersSilverlight project. 2.	 Open InvadersGame.cs.  [ 233 ]   Animating 3D Characters  3.	 Replace the declaration for the InvadersGame class with this one.  Now, it will be    a subclass of RealTimeGame. : public class InvadersGame : RealTimeGame  4.	 Replace the declaration of the Update method with the following.  Now, we    override the UpdateWithTime method instead. : public override void UpdateWithTime    5.	 Remove or comment the following line of code in this method:    base.Update  ;  6.	 Build and run the solution. The application will run as in the previous examples.    You will not notice any changes.  What just happened? We made the necessary changes to our main Game class to specialize the new  RealTimeGame superclass. Now, we will be able to animate the 3D characters whilst  considering the elapsed time.  Time for action – creating a subclass for a 3D character Now, we are going to create a specialized subclass of Actor  Balder.Core.Runtime. Actor  for the UFO. This is our first intent to generalize many behaviors related to 3D  characters. In this case, it is a 3D character composed of just one model  an instance of Mesh .  1.	 Stay in the3DInvadersSilverlight project. 2.	 Create a new class—Ufo  a subclass of Actor —using the following declaration:  public class Ufo : Actor  3.	 Add the following lines of code at the beginning  as we are going to use many    of Balder's classes and interfaces : using Balder.Core; using Balder.Core.Geometries; using Balder.Core.Math; using Balder.Core.Runtime;  and the Scene instances: protected RealTimeGame _game; protected Scene _scene;  [ 234 ]  4.	 Add the following protected variables to hold references for the RealTimeGame     5.	 Add the following protected variable to hold the 3D model  an instance of Mesh :  protected Mesh _mesh;  6.	 Add the following constructor with two parameters, the RealTimeGame and    Chapter 8  the Scene instances: public Ufo RealTimeGame game, Scene scene  {   _game = game;   _scene = scene; }  initial position: public override void LoadContent   {     base.LoadContent  ;  7.	 Override the LoadContent method to load the UFO's mesh and set its      _mesh = _game.ContentManager.Load  "ufo01.ase" ;   _scene.AddNode _mesh ;   _mesh.Position.X = -20;   _mesh.Position.Z = 0;   _mesh.Position.Y = 0; }  8.	 Override the Update method to change the UFO's position taking into account its    initial location, fixed speed settings, and the elapsed time: public override void Update   {   base.Update  ;      Update the X-coordinate according to the elapsed time and a       fixed speed   _mesh.Position.X += 1f *  float _game.ElapsedTime.TotalSeconds;      Update the Z-coordinate according to the elapsed time and a       fixed speed   _mesh.Position.Z -= 2f *  float _game.ElapsedTime.TotalSeconds;      Update the Y-coordinate according to the elapsed time and a       fixed speed   _mesh.Position.Y -= 2f *  float _game.ElapsedTime.TotalSeconds; }  [ 235 ]   Animating 3D Characters  What just happened? Now, we have a subclass of Actor that loads the UFO's model and updates its position.  Creating subclasses of Actor and overriding its methods, we can create 3D characters with  different behaviors.  In this case, we defined the specific behavior by overriding the Update method.  However, we can also add methods to the subclass, as previously done with 2D  characters. Everything we have learned so far about the advantages of using  object-oriented characters in 2D scenes is also useful when working with our 3D  games. Now, we are focusing on other topics. However, we can also generalize  additional behaviors and add methods and properties to this subclass.  Using an Actor to represent a 3D character The most appropriate way to represent a 3D character in Balder is creating a new subclass of  the Actor class. It allows us to apply a nice object-oriented design to our games. Luckily, we  do not need to use wrappers, as we can inherit from the Actor class without problems.  We need to access the RealTimeGame instance from the Actor. We use RealTimeGame  instead of its superclass, Game, because it allows us to use its ElapsedTime property.   We also need to access the Scene instance from the Actor. We have to add the meshes  that define the 3D character to this Scene instance so that it can be taken into account   by the rendering process. Therefore, we used a constructor that saves the references to  these instances:  public Ufo RealTimeGame game, Scene scene   We have overridden the LoadContent method. We used it in a way similar to what we   had previously learnt for loading models in the Game subclasses. In fact, Game is a subclass   of Actor.  Once the mesh was loaded, we added it to the active scene  previously saved in   the constructor :  _mesh = _game.ContentManager.Load  "ufo01.ase" ; _scene.AddNode _mesh ;  The initial position for the UFO's model is X = -20; Z = 0, and Y = 0. We changed the values of  the three fields from the Balder's 3D vectors to define the initial position:  _mesh.Position.X = -20; _mesh.Position.Z = 0; _mesh.Position.Y = 0;  [ 236 ]   Finally, we have overridden the Update method. As we had an instance of RealTimeGame  referenced in the _game protected variable, we could access its ElapsedTime property to  update the three axes and translate the UFO in the 3D space. We updated each coordinate  considering the elapsed time and a fixed speed, converted to a float because Position is a  3D vector. In the following line, we increase the X-coordinate by 1 for each second elapsed:   _mesh.Position.X += 1f *  float _game.ElapsedTime.TotalSeconds;  Chapter 8  The Ufo class contains all the code to control a simple UFO's movement in  our scene. It encapsulates a 3D character.  Time for action – adding an Actor to the game Now, we are going to add the UFO as an actor to our existing game, with a   predefined behavior:  1.	 Stay in the 3DInvadersSilverlight project. 2.	 Open InvadersGame.cs. 3.	 Add the following private variable in the public class   InvadersGame : RealTimeGame, to hold the new Ufo instance: private Ufo _ufo1;  4.	 Add the following lines of code before the end of the Initialize method    to create an Ufo instance and add this actor to the game: _ufo1 = new Ufo this, Scene ; AddActor _ufo1 ;  5.	 Build and run the solution. The default web browser will appear displaying the two   spaceships, and an UFO made of bricks moving through the 3D space, as shown   in the following picture:  [ 237 ]   Animating 3D Characters  6.	 Click on the web browser's viewport to activate its focus. Move the mouse left  and right. You will see that the camera that targets the spaceships and the new  UFO rotates as the mouse is moved. Use the cursor movement keys to control the  camera. Remember that you can also use your gamepad to control the camera.  While rotating the camera, the UFO will go on moving, as shown in the   following picture:  What just happened? Wow! A UFO made of bricks appeared flying on the scene. Your project manager likes the  simple animation. He is amazed with the possibility to add 3D characters with animation  capabilities adding just a few lines of code. He calls the 3D digital artists and asks them   to create dozens of new models for this game. You will have to work hard in order to create   a lot of new subclasses of the Actor class.  Moving 3D characters as Actors We added an instance of the previously programmed Ufo class to our main game   class—InvadersGame.  We added two simple lines of code to the InvadersGame class's overridden Initialize  method. As InvadersGame is a subclass of the previously created RealTimeGame, we could  use this as the first parameter to the Ufo's constructor. We also used the Scene property:  _ufo1 = new Ufo this, Scene ;  [ 23 ]   Chapter 8  Once we created the desired instance of a subclass of Actor  Ufo , we just have to call the  AddActor method:  AddActor _ufo1 ;  This method adds the instance to a private List   a collection of actors . The  game will call the LoadContent, Update and other methods when necessary for each actor  found in this collection. Hence, we do not need to add code to the game class. We can use  Actor subclasses to create simple or complex 3D characters with their own behavior.  In this case, the LoadContent method has the code to load the UFO's model as a Mesh and  the Update method changes the position of this Mesh according to the elapsed time.  This way, the code in the main game class is simpler and easier to understand.  We can also add methods to each Actor subclass and we can call them from  the game's UpdateWithTime procedure to have more control over their  behavior. We had already done these things when working with 2D sprites.  Time for action – rotating 3D characters You have a problem. UFOs do not fly just by moving through the space. They usually rotate  around themselves while moving in the different directions.  Now, we are going to add rotation capabilities to this 3D character.  1.	 Stay in the 3DInvadersSilverlight project. 2.	 Open Ufo.cs. 3.	 Add the following protected variables.  The UFO has to keep track of the   rotation angles and it has to rotate at certain speeds, both defined for each axis :    The rotation angles protected Vector _angleDegrees = new Vector 0, 0, 0 ;    The rotation speed for the three axis protected Vector _rotationSpeed = new Vector 10f, 5f, 0f ;  4.	 Add the following public method to calculate the UFO's rotation angles taking   into account its rotation speed settings for each axis and the elapsed time: public void CalculateNewAngles   {   _angleDegrees.X =   _angleDegrees.X + _rotationSpeed.X *                       float _game.ElapsedTime.TotalSeconds  % 360 ;  [ 23 ]   Animating 3D Characters    _angleDegrees.Y =   _angleDegrees.Y + _rotationSpeed.Y *                       float _game.ElapsedTime.TotalSeconds  % 360 ;   _angleDegrees.Z =   _angleDegrees.Z + _rotationSpeed.Z *                       float _game.ElapsedTime.TotalSeconds  % 360 ; }  5.	 Add the following lines of code before the end of the Update method to calculate   the new angles, update the mesh's world matrix and rotate the model: CalculateNewAngles  ; _mesh.World =          Balder.Core.Math.Matrix.CreateRotationX _angleDegrees.X  *         Balder.Core.Math.Matrix.CreateRotationY _angleDegrees.Y  *         Balder.Core.Math.Matrix.CreateRotationZ _angleDegrees.Z ; 6.	 Build and run the solution. The default web browser will appear, displaying the two   spaceships, and a UFO made of bricks rotating around itself in two axis while   moving through the 3D space, as shown in the following picture:  7.	 Rotate the camera and watch the UFO moving and rotating while the camera is    changing its position.  What just happened? Now, the UFO moves and rotates at the same time, just like a real-life UFO. Do you believe in  the existence of UFOs?  The code to add rotation capabilities to the UFO is now held in its class  a subclass of Actor .  We added two 3D vector variables:      _angleDegrees. It holds the current rotation angle in degrees, for each axis. The  initial angle is 0 for each axis—X= 0, Y = 0, and Z = 0. _rotationSpeed. It allows us to set a rotation speed in degrees per second. The  initial rotation speed for each axis is—X = 10, Y = 5, and Z = 0.  [ 240 ]   Chapter 8  The CalculateNewAngles method calculates and saves the new angle for each axis,  considering the rotation speed defined for the axis and the elapsed time. If the calculated  angle for the axis is greater than 360 degrees, it will return to 0  _angleDegrees.X =   _angleDegrees.X + _rotationSpeed.X *                      float _game.ElapsedTime.TotalSeconds  % 360 ;  Using the World matrix in order to perform transformations   to meshes We have added code to the Update method in order to calculate the new angles for each  axis. Then, we changed the value of the World property for the UFO's Mesh.  The World field is of the type Matrix  Balder.Core.Math.Matrix  and it represents the  world matrix for the model. This simple 4X4 matrix allows us to transform the model using  world coordinates. It offers a very flexible way to place and construct all the pieces of the   3D world, irrespective of what we can actually see using the active camera.  Changing the values of the world matrix's elements, we can perform the following  transformations to a mesh:        Translate Rotate Scale  We can perform these transformations to any of the three axes  X, Y, and Z  changing the  values of the world matrix's elements. For example, we can translate the mesh in the X-axis  and rotate it in the Y-axis. The combination of these transforms can be represented by the  4X4 world matrix.  On one hand, matrices algebra makes graphical transformations easy to  manipulate. On the other hand, performing some transformations using  matrices involves complex calculations. We should not be scared about matrices,  as they are part of our basic education. However, we do not want to introduce  mistakes in to our game and we want to keep things simple.  A rectangular array of numbers defines a matrix. It has a fixed number of rows and columns.  The 4X4 world matrix has four rows and four columns.  Luckily, Balder's Matrix class offers many operators and methods in order to allow us to  apply transformations without needing to become skilled at matrices algebra. Hence, we   do not need to re-open our old matrices algebra workbook.  [ 241 ]   Animating 3D Characters  The initial values for the world matrix are ones on the diagonal, from the upper-left corner to  the bottom-right corner. The remaining values are zeros, as shown in the following table that  represents the initial world matrix:  The CreateRotationX, CreateRotationY, and CreateRotationZ static methods  return a new Matrix with the necessary values to rotate the Mesh in the corresponding  axis, considering the angle in degrees received as a parameter.  If we want to rotate a model 90 degrees over the Z-axis, we just need to assign the new  Matrix created by the CreateRotationZ method to the Mesh's World property, as   shown in the following line of code:  _mesh.World = Balder.Core.Math.Matrix.CreateRotationZ 90 ;  The resulting world matrix to perform this rotation of 90 degrees over the Z-axis is   the following:  If we want to rotate a model 45 degrees over the Y-axis, the mechanism is pretty similar:  _mesh.World = Balder.Core.Math.Matrix.CreateRotationY 45 ;  The resulting world matrix to perform this rotation of 45 degrees is the following:  1 0 0 0  0 1 0 0  0 0 1 0  0 0 0 1  0 -1 0 0  1 0 0 0  0 0 1 0  0 0 0 1  0.7071  -0.7071  0.7071  0.7071  0 1 0 0  0  0  0 0 0 1  0  0  [ 242 ]   Chapter 8  One of the questions that might arise is why Balder.Core.Math.Matrix was used to  call each method instead of Matrix. The System.Windows.Media.Matrix namespace  also has a definition for a Matrix class. This namespace is automatically added to the  using statements for each new class created in a Silverlight application. Hence, we have  two alternatives, removing the System.Windows.Media.Matrix namespace for the class  or using the full reference to Balder's Matrix class. As the default situation will be usually  having the System.Windows.Media.Matrix namespace included, we used the   full reference.  Balder's Matrix class mimics many capabilities offered by the Matrix  class provided by XNA Framework  XNA Game Studio .   Performing compound transformations Compound transformations are equivalent to matrix multiplications. Hence, in order to  perform many transformations to a Mesh at the same time, we just need to assign the result  of multiplying many new Matrix instances, created by calling the methods offered by  Balder's Matrix class, to the Mesh's World property.  If we want to rotate a model 90 degrees over the Z-axis and 45 degrees over the Y-axis, we  just need to assign the result of multiplying two matrices to the Mesh's World property, as  shown in the following line of code:  _mesh.World = Balder.Core.Math.Matrix.CreateRotationZ 90  *               Balder.Core.Math.Matrix.CreateRotationY 45 ;  The resulting world matrix to perform these two rotations is the following:  -0.7071 0.7071  0.7071 0.7071  0  0  1 0 0 0  0  0  0 0 0 1  In fact, it is the result of multiplying the previously shown two matrices. However, we do not  need to worry about the details.  Time for action – scaling 3D characters The UFO is too small. You want to make it appear bigger on the rendered scene. However,  you do not want to change the camera's parameters. Unfortunately, the 3D digital artists  cannot change the original model because they are attending a conference.  [ 243 ]   Animating 3D Characters  Now, we are going to scale this 3D character changing the values of the world   matrix's elements.  1.	 Stay in the3DInvadersSilverlight project. 2.	 Open Ufo.cs. 3.	 Replace the lines that update the mesh's world matrix with these:  _mesh.World =          Balder.Core.Math.Matrix.CreateRotationX _angleDegrees.X  *         Balder.Core.Math.Matrix.CreateRotationY _angleDegrees.Y  *         Balder.Core.Math.Matrix.CreateRotationZ _angleDegrees.Z  *        Balder.Core.Math.Matrix.CreateScale new Vector 4f, 4f, 4f  ; 4.	 Build and run the solution. The default web browser will appear displaying the two  spaceships, and a bigger UFO made of bricks rotating around itself in two axes while   moving through the 3D space, as shown in the following screenshot:  5.	 Rotate the camera and watch scaled UFO moving and rotating while the camera is    changing its position.  What just happened? Now, the UFO is four times bigger than it was before. It scales, moves, and rotates at the  same time. The code to perform a scale transformation to the three axes—X, Y, and Z— is  now held in its class  a subclass of Actor .  Using the World matrix in order to scale meshes We changed the value of the World property for the UFO's Mesh. This time, we multiplied  the matrix resulting from the previously added two rotations by a new matrix created by the  CreateScale static method.  This method returns a new Matrix with the necessary values to scale the Mesh in the three  axes, considering the three scale ratios received in a Vector instance as a parameter.  [ 244 ]   Chapter 8  If we want to scale a model 1.5 times on the X-axis, 2 times on the Y-axis and 3 times on the  Z-axis, we just need to assign the new Matrix created by the CreateScale method to the  Mesh's World property, as shown in the following line of code:  _mesh.World = Balder.Core.Math.Matrix.CreateScale new Vector 1.5f,                                                              2f, 3f  ;  The resulting world matrix to perform this resizing with different scale ratios for each axis is  the following:  In this case, the matrix is very easy to understand. We can find the scale ratios in the first  three values on the diagonal, from the upper-left corner to the bottom-right—1.5 for the   X-axis; 2 for the Y-axis and 3 for the Z-axis.  As we wanted to scale the UFO's model four times, we multiplied the world matrix with this  new one:  Balder.Core.Math.Matrix.CreateScale new Vector 4f, 4f, 4f  ;  The matrix return from this method to perform this resizing with a scale ratio of 4:1 for each  axis is the following:  We did not need to scale the model using a 3D DCC tool. We could scale it performing a  compound transformation changing the values for the world matrix.  Have a go hero – creating a specialized XAML 3D character wrapper class Your project manager wants to use the full potential offered by an additional steering wheel  to control the UFO. This means that you have to add the UFO to the WPF XBAP application.  However, he also wants a random number of UFOs to appear in the scene, moving   and rotating.  1.5 0 0 0  0 2 0 0  0 0 3 0  0 0 0 1  4 0 0 0  0 4 0 0  0 0 4 0  0 0 0 1  [ 245 ]   Animating 3D Characters  The easiest way to control so many 3D characters is to work with a good object-oriented  design. You have to prepare the main scene creating ModelVisual3D elements. Thus, you  can create a generalized superclass to manage the most common operations related to a  ModelVisual3D element working as a 3D character in the scene.  You can create a wrapper class, as done in your previous 2D experience with the  SpriteWrapper class.  The most common operations to display a 3D character based on a ModelVisual3D  instance must be encapsulated in methods in this new class. The instances of the subclasses  of this new superclass will be real independent 3D characters, capable of defining the most  complex of behaviors.  Every character with a particular behavior can have its own subclass. Therefore, you can  create new classes to manage the 3D characters according to your needs.  Using bones and skeletons  So far, we have been animating 3D characters based on a single mesh. We moved, rotated  and scaled single meshes using instances of the Actor class in Silverlight applications.  However, we did not animate specific parts of the model, like arms, legs, heads, and so on.  How can we animate bones and skeletons defined in complex models in Silverlight?  Most 3D DCC tools offer different ways to create fully animatable 3D characters. Some  advanced techniques allow the digital artist to specify the mapping between the motions   of a real-life actor or input device and those of the character.  Unfortunately, we cannot import the animation definitions stored in many 3D character file  formats. However, we are still able to create a 3D character using the bones and skeletons  concepts. We can do this combining many autonomous meshes and performing independent  transformations to them.  This requires additional work and is more complex than using a 3D character defined in a  specialized 3D DCC tool. We have to create independent models for each animatable part   of the 3D character and work with them as meshes using a good object-oriented design.  The key to success is converting a complex model into multiple independent  simple models. Then, moving, rotating and scaling each independent mesh,  we can create the most exciting and realistic animations.  [ 246 ]   Chapter 8  Time for action – animating models with skeletons and bones Your project manager's favorite animated series was Transformers. He loves the idea of big  robots composed of smaller robots working as arms, legs and heads. He wants you to create  a new strange 3D character for the game with a head, a chest, and two arms. However, there  are no new models. You have to use the UFO and the spaceships with different textures.  Now, we are going to create a new specialized subclass of Actor  Balder.Core.Runtime. Actor  for this complex robot. This is our first attempt to animate a complex 3D model using  the skeletons and bones concept. In this case, it is a 3D character composed of many models   many independent instances of Mesh .  1.	 Stay in the 3DInvadersSilverlight project,. 2.	 Create a new class—Robot  a subclass of Actor —using the following declaration:  3.	 Add the following lines of code at the beginning  as we are going to use many    public class Robot : Actor  Balder's classes and interfaces : using Balder.Core; using Balder.Core.Geometries; using Balder.Core.Math; using Balder.Core.Runtime;  and the Scene instances: protected RealTimeGame _game; protected Scene _scene;  instances of Mesh : protected Mesh _meshHead; protected Mesh _meshLeftArm; protected Mesh _meshRightArm; protected Mesh _meshChest;  4.	 Add the following protected variables to hold references for the RealTimeGame    5.	 Add the following protected variable to hold the 3D models  the independent    6.	 Add the following constructor with two parameters, the RealTimeGame and the    Scene instances: public Robot RealTimeGame game, Scene scene  {     _game = game;     _scene = scene; }  [ 247 ]   Animating 3D Characters  7.	 Override the LoadContent method to load the Robot's meshes and set their initial    positions and transformations: public override void LoadContent   {   base.LoadContent  ;      Load the meshes and set their initial positions      Add the head   _meshHead = _game.ContentManager.Load  "ufo01.ase" ;   _scene.AddNode _meshHead ;   _meshHead.Position.X = -12;   _meshHead.Position.Z = 0;   _meshHead.Position.Y = 0;   _meshHead.World = Balder.Core.Math.Matrix.CreateScale                                           new Vector 2f, 2f, 2f   *                      Balder.Core.Math.Matrix.CreateRotationX 270 ;      Add the chest   _meshChest =            _game.ContentManager.Load  "ship01_texture01.ase" ;   _scene.AddNode _meshChest ;   _meshChest.Position.X = -12;   _meshChest.Position.Z = 1;   _meshChest.Position.Y = 4;   _meshChest.World = Balder.Core.Math.Matrix.CreateRotationY 180 ;      Add the left and right arms   _meshLeftArm =            _game.ContentManager.Load  "ship01_texture02.ase" ;   _scene.AddNode _meshLeftArm ;   _meshLeftArm.Position.X = -19;   _meshLeftArm.Position.Z = 1;   _meshLeftArm.Position.Y = 2;   _meshLeftArm.World = Balder.Core.Math.Matrix.CreateRotationZ                                                               -90 ;   _meshRightArm =            _game.ContentManager.Load  "ship01_texture02.ase" ;   _scene.AddNode _meshRightArm ;   _meshRightArm.Position.X = -6;   _meshRightArm.Position.Z = 1;   _meshRightArm.Position.Y = 2;   _meshRightArm.World =                        Balder.Core.Math.Matrix.CreateRotationZ 90 ; }  [ 24 ]   Chapter 8  What just happened? Now, we have a subclass of Actor that loads the Robot's models as independent meshes  with different initial positions and transformations.  Creating subclasses of Actor and overriding its methods, we can create complex 3D  characters with different behaviors.  Using skeletons and bones The most appropriate way to represent skeletons and bones for a complex 3D character  in Balder is creating a new subclass of the Actor class. It allows us to apply a nice object- oriented design to a complex animation technique creating as many meshes as necessary  bones for our skeleton.  We have overridden the LoadContent method. We used it for loading many models that  compose our complex 3D character.  Once each mesh was loaded, we added it to the active scene  previously saved in the  constructor , we assigned its initial position. Then, we rotated and scaled it changing the  values of its world matrix, as previously learned.  This way, we could create the following independent meshes that define the complex   3D character:          A head: A UFO with a scale ratio of 2:1 and rotated 270 degrees over the X-axis. A chest: A spaceship with the original texture and rotated 180 degrees over   the Y-axis. A left arm: A spaceship with the second texture and rotated -90 degrees over   the Z-axis. A right arm: A spaceship with the second texture and rotated 90 degrees over   the Z-axis.  The Robot class contains all the code to control a complex Robot's  movement in our scene. It encapsulates a complex 3D character with  independent meshes. Overriding its Update method, we can move, rotate  and scale each independent mesh to create exciting animations.  [ 24 ]   Animating 3D Characters  Time for action – adding an Actor with skeletons and  bones to the game Now we are going to add the Robot as an actor to our existing game:  1.	 Stay in the project 3DInvadersSilverlight. 2.	 Open InvadersGame.cs. 3.	 Add the following private variable in the public class InvadersGame   : RealTimeGame, to hold the new Robot instance: private Robot _robot1;  4.	 Add the following lines of code before the end of the Initialize method to    create a Robot instance and add this complex actor to the game: _robot1 = new Robot this, Scene ; AddActor _robot1 ;  5.	 Build and run the solution. The default web browser will appear displaying the   strange robot on the left part of the scene, as shown in the following screenshot:  6.	 Move the camera to see the robot from different angles while the UFO performs    its already well-known animation.  What just happened? A complex robot appeared on the scene. You could find the specific positions and rotations  needed for each mesh to create the robot. Now, you will have to work hard in order to  animate complex 3D characters created using multiple independent models.  [ 250 ]   Understanding complex 3D animation techniques The techniques used to animate complex 3D models are just a combination of multiple  transformations performed to many meshes in the same frame.  The robot has the independent meshes, as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 8  Thus, we can rotate the left arm  _meshLeftArm  to a certain number of degrees on the  X-axis, and rotate the right arm  _meshRightArm  to a certain number of degrees on the  Y-axis. Performing this kind of independent transformations to each mesh, we can reproduce  any kind of animation, such as a robot or alien walking.  Each movable element in these kinds of 3D characters must be an independent  mesh. Then, we can take full advantage of the object-oriented design to create  methods that simplify the most common animations.  First, we can create simple methods with specific parameters according to the animation's  needs, like the following:        MoveRightArm  MoveLeftArm RotateHead  [ 251 ]   Animating 3D Characters  Then, we can create higher level methods like these:        WalkStep  Run  LookDown  These animations involving multiple transformations over many meshes, require a lot of  code. Therefore, it is very important to create methods in order to allow us to reuse code  in many high-level animation methods. For example, both WalkStep and Run must call  MoveRightArm and MoveLeftArm.  Have a go hero – aliens walking It is time to work harder. Your project manager wants you to create a very complex   3D character and to animate it using the techniques you have already learned.  Create many independent 3D models, using very simple geometries, to use as meshes for an  alien with a skeleton, similar to the one shown in the following diagram:  Create a subclass of Actor with the following independent meshes:  Left hand  Left forearm  Left upper arm  Right upper arm  Right forearm  Right hand  Left foot  Left calf  Left thigh  Right thigh  Right calf  Right foot  Head  Neck  Chest  and backbone  [ 252 ]   Chapter 8  Add the code to show the independent meshes that comprise the skeleton in their initial  positions. Once the alien appears on the scene as expected, create low and high level  methods to let him walk on the scene.  You just have to perform many independent transformations to the meshes. You can do it. It  requires many lines of code, but it is easier than expected.  Pop quiz – animating 3D characters in a scene  1.  You can move a 3D character using Balder changing the values of:  a.  The 3D vector Position for the instance of the Actor superclass. b.

In order to animate a complex 3D character in Silveright using Balder, you can:  a.  Move, rotate, and scale each independent mesh. b.  Extract bones from the 3D characters defined in the 3D DCC tools    using Balder's Import3DCharacter function.  c.  Create a subclass of 3DCharacter and then call the    LoadBones method.  Summary  We learned a lot in this chapter about animating 3D characters. Specifically, we were able to  move, rotate, and scale the 3D models in the 3D scenes. We used object-oriented capabilities  to define independent behaviors for simple and complex 3D characters. We understood  simple techniques to perform many transformations to a 3D model using the complex world  matrix. We also understood how to animate complex 3D characters composed with many  independent meshes that define a skeleton with many animatable bones.  Now that we've learned to animate 3D characters in a 3D scene, we're ready to generate  physics using engines, which is the topic of the next chapter.  [ 254 ]     Adding Realistic Motions Using   a Physics Engine  In order to represent real-life behaviors in our games, we must simulate the  effects of the laws of 3D physics in our 3D scenes. A UFO flying near the Earth  will be attracted by gravitational force. Real things move and spin responding  to forces, impulses, and torques. Therefore, we have to add physics simulation  capabilities to our models' animations. We have to create a 3D world capable  of reproducing some realistic behaviors.   Reading this chapter and following the exercises we shall learn how to:                Define parameters to work with physics simulation Simulate real-life physics in each model movement and rotation Add a gravitational force to a 3D scene Define specific physics behaviors for the 3D characters that compose the 3D world Understand how to apply forces and impulses to move a 3D model Control the 3D models' rotations using torques Animate particle systems using a physics engine   Adding Realistic Motions Using a Physics Engine  Using physical principles in games to beat invaders  So far, we have been displaying and animating simple and complex 3D models in our 3D  scenes. We translated and rotated them considering the elapsed time and according to the  values read from the input devices. We used very simple linear formulas to translate and  rotate the models. However, in the real world, things move and rotate due to applied forces  and torques. Modern games must simulate real-life situations. Therefore, we have to move  and rotate our 3D characters according to the laws of 3D physics. How can we apply forces  and torques to multiple independent and concurrent 3D characters in Silverlight?  We can accomplish this by combining our good object-oriented design with the power of  a specialized physics engine. We can add realistic motions through space-time and all that  derives from these, such as energy and force, using a physics engine to simulate real physics  in our virtual worlds. This way, we can animate our 3D characters while simulating both  simple and complex laws of 3D physics without worrying about the underlying formulas.  The key to success is reducing the complexity of the mathematics involved  in 3D physics using a parallel representation of the 3D world in the physics  engine's bodies and geometries.  Time for action – installing Farseer Physics Engine Your project manager has a Ph.D. in Physics. So, he is an expert in gravity, speed,  acceleration, impulses, torques, moments of inertia, friction coefficients, and so on. The UFO  and the spaceship will be fighting near the Earth. Therefore, you must consider gravitational  force. Speed cannot be linear. The UFO and the spaceship should have impulses. The UFO  should rotate using an angular velocity and considering a rotational drag coefficient. You  have to improve the game applying the laws of 3D physics.  You have great difficulties with the laws of physics. Your project manager knows this and he  suggests using a high-level physics engine—wait, do not run away! You will not need to learn  complex physics laws in order to apply them in your games.  Farseer Physics Engine  http:  farseerphysics.codeplex.com   is an easy-to-use,  open source 2D physics engine designed for XNA Framework and Silverlight. It focuses on  simplicity and useful features, along with enabling the creation of entertaining, dynamic  games. As it does not offer direct support for 3D physics, we will have to use some tricks in  order to take advantage of its excellent features in our 3D games. It offers the possibility to  control the position and rotation of game entities over time, applying physics through the  use of a very simple object-oriented engine.  [ 256 ]   Chapter 9  We will use Farseer Physics Engine to add 3D real-time physics capabilities to Farseer Physics Engine to add 3D real-time physics capabilities to  to add 3D real-time physics capabilities to real-time physics capabilities to  Silverlight for our games. However in some cases you will need to fine-tune the  results offered by this 2D engine in our 3D worlds.  Now, we are going to update our Silverlight application adding the necessary references to  use Farseer Physics Engine 2.1.  1.	 Download Farseer Physics Engine release 2.1 for Silverlight,  available at http:  farseerphysics.codeplex.com  Release ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=19656.

Now the project will list the reference to the aforementioned DLL in   the Solution Explorer, as shown in the following screenshot:  What just happened? We downloaded Farseer Physics Engine 2.1 and we added the necessary references to use it  in a Silverlight project. The previously explained steps are the only ones required to access  Farseer Physics' classes, types, and functions in any new Silverlight application.  [ 25 ]   Time for action – adding parallel physics bodies and  geometries to 3D characters We are now going to add a body and geometry to represent the UFO in the physics engine  world. This is our first attempt to add physics using Farseer Physics Engine.  Chapter 9  1.	 Stay in the project 3DInvadersSilverlight. 2.	 Open Ufo.cs.cs. 3.	 Add the following lines of code at the beginning  as we are   going to use many of Farseer's classes and interfaces : using FarseerGames.FarseerPhysics; using FarseerGames.FarseerPhysics.Collisions; using FarseerGames.FarseerPhysics.Dynamics; using FarseerGames.FarseerPhysics.Factories; using FarseerGames.FarseerPhysics.Mathematics;  4.	 Add the following public properties:  public Body Body { get; private set; } public Geom Geom { get; private set; } public float Width { get; private set; } public float Height { get; private set; } public float Mass { get; private set; }  5.	 Replace the old constructor with the following one, which has three parameters—   and the PhysicsSimulator instances:  the RealTimeGame, the Scene, and the public Ufo RealTimeGame game, Scene scene, PhysicsSimulator  physicsSimulator  {   _game = game;   _scene = scene;   Width = 5;   Height = 1;   Mass = 1;      Create the body and set its linear drag coefficient   Body =         BodyFactory.Instance.CreateRectangleBody physicsSimulator,                                              Width, Height, Mass ;   Body.LinearDragCoefficient = 0.4f;      Create the geometry  Geom  and set its friction coefficient   Geom =          GeomFactory.Instance.CreateRectangleGeom physicsSimulator,                                              Body, Width, Height ;   Geom.FrictionCoefficient = .2f; }  [ 25 ]   Adding Realistic Motions Using a Physics Engine  6.	 Replace the old LoadContent method with the following one  we change the initial    position for the mesh and we assign it to the Body instance : public override void LoadContent   {   base.LoadContent  ;   _mesh = _game.ContentManager.Load  "ufo01.ase" ;   _scene.AddNode _mesh ;   _mesh.Position.X = -20;   _mesh.Position.Z = 0;   _mesh.Position.Y = -2;   Body.Position = new Vector2 _mesh.Position.X, _mesh.Position.Y ; }  7.	 Replace the old Update method with this one  now the physics engine updates the    Body's position :  public override void Update   {   base.Update  ;   _mesh.Position.X = Body.Position.X;   _mesh.Position.Y = Body.Position.Y; }  What just happened? We now have a subclass of Actor that loads the UFO's model, creates a body and geometry  in the physics engine, and updates its location according to the body's calculated position.  Creating bodies and geometries related to our 3D characters, we are able to apply physics  even using a 2D engine.  Creating bodies We need to access the PhysicsSimulator  FarseerGames.FarseerPhysics. PhysicsSimulator  instance from the Actor. We have to add the body and geometry  that define the 3D character in the physics simulator to this instance, in order to be  taken into account by each phase of the simulation process. Therefore, we use a constructor  that receives the reference to this instance as its third parameter.  public Ufo RealTimeGame game, Scene scene, PhysicsSimulator                                                       physicsSimulator   The bodies represent the real world things in the 2D physics simulator. We can apply forces,  impulses, and torques to these bodies and they are going to react according to the laws   of 2D physics.  [ 260 ]   The body factory allows us to create different kinds of bodies  Body instances  and add them  to the specified simulator, received as a parameter. In this case, we create a rectangle body  with a specific width, height, and mass. Using these parameters, Farseer will calculate the  moment of inertia.  Body = BodyFactory.Instance.CreateRectangleBody physicsSimulator,                                                   Width, Height, Mass ;  Chapter 9  A rectangle is not the best representation for our UFO. However, we are learning  how to use the physics simulator. We will be able to improve the accuracy of the  simulation later.  We create a Body instance with a width of 5, height of 1, and mass of 2. We also assigned a  linear drag coefficient of 0.4.  Body.LinearDragCoefficient = 0.4f;  Drag is the force that resists the movement of a body through a fluid or gas.  A body moving through the air will gradually slow down due to the drag. The  higher the linear drag coefficient, the more force the body needs to be moved.   The higher the linear drag coefficient, the faster the body will slow down due to  the drag. Air is a gas and the UFO has to move through the air.  Creating geometries The geometries  Geom instances  define the edges for a shape and are associated to a body   a Body instance . They control the collision detection process and control the calculation of  the impulses associated with colliding with other geometries.  The geometry factory allows us to create different kinds of geometries. Besides, it allows  us to add them to the specified simulator that is received as a parameter, and associate  them with a previously created Body instance. In this case, we create a rectangle geometry  with the same width and height used to create the associated Body instance. Using these  parameters, Farseer will create the set of vertices that define the shape.  Geom = GeomFactory.Instance.CreateRectangleGeom physicsSimulator,                                                  Body, Width, Height ;  Besides, we assigned a friction coefficient of 0.2:  Geom.FrictionCoefficient = .2f;  Friction is the force that opposes the relative motion of two material surfaces  in contact with one another. The higher the friction coefficient, the harder it is to  move relative to the other material with which the geometry is in contact.  [ 261 ]   Adding Realistic Motions Using a Physics Engine  Updating a 3D model according to the associated body's  properties Once the mesh is loaded and added to the active scene, we set its initial position. We  then define the initial position for the associated Body instance, creating a new 2D vector   Vector2  and sending the X and Y values taking them from the mesh X and Y values:  Body.Position = new Vector2 _mesh.Position.X, _mesh.Position.Y ;  This way, we are replicating two out of the three axes in the physics simulator.  We are working with the X and Y axis, without considering the Z-axis.  Finally, we have overridden the Update method with a new one. When this method is  called, the physics simulator has already updated the bodies according to the forces,  impulses, and torques applied. Thus, we just have to use the associated Body instance's  properties to update our mesh.  _mesh.Position.X = Body.Position.X; _mesh.Position.Y = Body.Position.Y;  Time for action – working with forces, impulses, acceleration,  and speed We are now going to use Farseer Physics Engine to add a gravitational force affecting the  UFO. Also, we will add the possibility to apply a force to accelerate the UFO and to impulse it,  updating its speed.  1.	 Stay in the 3DInvadersSilverlight project. 2.	 Open InvadersGame.cs.cs. 3.	 Add the following lines of code at the beginning  as we are   going to use many Farseer's classes and interfaces : using FarseerGames.FarseerPhysics; using FarseerGames.FarseerPhysics.Collisions; using FarseerGames.FarseerPhysics.Dynamics; using FarseerGames.FarseerPhysics.Factories; using FarseerGames.FarseerPhysics.Mathematics;  4.	 Add the following private variable in the public class   InvadersGame : RealTimeGame, to hold the new PhysicsSimulator   FarseerGames.FarseerPhysics.PhysicsSimulator  instance: private PhysicsSimulator _physicsSimulator;  [ 262 ]   Chapter 9  5.	 Add the following private method to initialize Farseer Physics Engine,   specifying the desired gravitational force as a 2D vector parameter: private void InitializePhysicsSimulator   {   _physicsSimulator = new PhysicsSimulator new Vector2 0f,  0.25f  ;     50 pixels = 1 meter   ConvertUnits.SetDisplayUnitToSimUnitRatio 50 ; }  6.	 Add the following line of code before the creation of the Ufo instance in the    Initialize method: InitializePhysicsSimulator  ;  7.	 Comment the lines that create and add the Robot instance as a new actor     we need to pay attention to the UFO's behavior .   _robot1 = new Robot this, Scene ;   AddActor _robot1 ;  8.

Now, add the following line of code before the end of the UpdateWithTime method:  _physicsSimulator.Update  float  _elapsedTime.TotalSeconds ;  10.	 Build and run the solution. The default web browser will appear displaying the two   spaceships and a UFO made of bricks. The UFO will move down through the 3D  space, attracted by the Earth's gravitational force, as shown in the following figure:  [ 263 ]   Adding Realistic Motions Using a Physics Engine  11.	 Click on the web browser's viewport to activate its focus. Press the F key and keep   it down for a few seconds, applying a force to the UFO. During the first seconds,  the UFO will seem to resist to the gravitational force that moves it down. After  these first few seconds, the UFO will break free of the gravitational force and it  will begin to move up and a bit to the left, as shown in the following figure:  12.	 Now, press the I key and keep it down for two seconds, applying an impulse   to the UFO. Then, release the key. During these seconds, the UFO will  seem to jump up and right. When you release the key, its speed will slow  down because the drag force is resisting the UFO's movement. Besides, the  gravitational force will pull it down again, as shown in the following figure:  [ 264 ]   What just happened? Using a 2D physics engine, you could simulate real-life physics for the UFO. Now, the UFO  offers a realistic movement through the air. Your project manager is calculating whether  the forces are working as expected or not. As you are using a 2D rectangle to represent the  UFO's 3D model in the physics simulator, you will have to make some additional tweaks to  cheat your project manager.  Chapter 9  Specifying the gravitational force As Farseer Physics Engine is a 2D physics simulator, it uses 2D vectors  Vector2  to   specify forces.  We must pass the desired gravity as a Vector2 to the PhysicsSimulator   constructor. In this case, we use a gravitational force that attracts the bodies to positive   Y values  Y = 0.25 .  _physicsSimulator = new PhysicsSimulator new Vector2 0f, 0.25f  ;  We can use Farseer's gravitational force to apply a global attraction force to all  the bodies that respond to gravity. We can turn off gravity for a specific Body  instance by setting its IgnoreGravity property to true. The default value  for this property is false.  Applying forces Whilst the F key is down, we apply a force to the UFO's Body instance to go up and a bit to  the left  X = 0.05; Y = -0.5 . We called the Body instance's ApplyForce method, passing a  new 2D vector with the definition for this force:  _ufo1.Body.ApplyForce new Vector2 -0.05f, -0.5f  ;  A force accelerates the body. It works like a jetpack, accelerating over time.  The physics simulator will take into account the kind of body, its size, its mass, its  parameters, its actual position, the specified gravitational force, and the elapsed time to  calculate the new position. When we call the Update method for the PhysicsSimulator  instance, we must pass the elapsed time in seconds as a parameter. It updates the positions  of all the bodies added to the simulator. Taking into account all the parameters, it applies all  the 2D physics laws it knows:  _physicsSimulator.Update  float  _elapsedTime.TotalSeconds ;  [ 265 ]   Adding Realistic Motions Using a Physics Engine  Thus, as previously explained, we could change the 3D character's position, borrowing the  values from the associated Body instance in the Actor's subclass Update method.  We do not have to calculate the new positions. The physics simulator does this  job taking into account all the parameters and applying 2D physics laws.   Applying impulses While the I key is down, we apply an impulse to the UFO's Body instance to go up and right   X = 0.25; Y = -0.25 . We called the Body instance's ApplyImpulse method, passing a new  2D vector with the definition for this force:  _ufo1.Body.ApplyImpulse new Vector2 0.25f, -0.25f  ;  An impulse performs an instant change in the moment of a body, and updates  its speed instead of accelerating it like a force. It makes the body jump.  The impulse will work as previously explained for the force. It will update the body's position  applying all the 2D physics laws it knows.  Using impulses and forces, we do not need to worry about speed and acceleration. We can  leave this work to the physics simulator.  Working with a 2D physics simulator in the game loop Once we have the 3D character defined as a subclass of Actor, we need to follow these  steps with Farseer Physics Engine, in order to update two of the three axes:  Initialize the physics simulator with a specific gravitational force. Initialize the physics simulator with a specific gravitational force.  1.  2.  Create a Body instance that represents this 3D model in the physics simulator    3.  Create a Geometry instance that represents the aforementioned Body, for collision   4.  Define the Body's 2D initial position, matching two out of the three axes for the    2D world.  detection purposes.  3D model.  5.  Apply forces, impulses, and or torques to each Body. 6.  Call the physics simulator Update method. 7.  Update the 3D model's position and rotation according to the properties exposed by   the updated Body instance. 8.  Respond to collision events.  [ 266 ]   Chapter 9  Time for action – working with torques and rotations Your project manager is planning to add more physics simulations to the game. He wants the  UFO to rotate around its Y-axis. However, it must follow the physics laws and the rotation  could occur while applying forces and or impulses to the UFO. Hence, you must use the  physics simulator capabilities to avoid buying a physics law book.  We are now going to use Farseer Physics Engine to add a torque affecting the UFO's rotation.  1.	 Stay in the project 3DInvadersSilverlight. 2.	 Open Ufo.cs.cs. 3.	 Add the following line of code before the end of the class' constructor:  Body.RotationalDragCoefficient = 0.2f;  4.

Add the following lines of code in the CheckKeyboard method,   before the line KeyboardManager.RemoveUpKeys  ;: if  KeyboardManager.IsKeyDown Key.R       _ufo1.Body.ApplyTorque 5f ;  7.	 Build and run the solution. The default web browser will appear displaying the two  spaceships, along with a UFO made of bricks. Click on the web browser's viewport  to activate its focus. Press the I key and keep it down for two seconds. Then, press  the R key for a few seconds. The UFO will rotate around its Y-axis. However, after  a few seconds, the rotation will become slower, as shown in the following figure:  [ 267 ]   Adding Realistic Motions Using a Physics Engine  What just happened? By using a 2D physics engine and adding just a few lines of code, you can simulate the  UFO's complex rotation considering many parameters. Now, the UFO offers realistic rotation  around its Y-axis while moving through the air.  Applying torques We specified a desired rotational drag coefficient of 0.2 to the UFO's Body instance.  Body.RotationalDragCoefficient = 0.2f;  Rotational drag is the force that resists the rotation of a body. A body rotating  will gradually slow down due to the rotational drag. The higher the rotational  drag coefficient, the more torque the body needs to be rotated.  The higher the  rotational drag coefficient, the faster the body's rotation will slow down due to  the drag. A value of 0 for the rotational drag would make a body rotate forever.  While the R key is down, we apply a torque to the UFO's Body instance to rotate. We   called the Body instance's ApplyTorque method, passing a float value with the   rotation strength:  _ufo1.Body.ApplyTorque 5f ;  Applying torque rotates the body. Hence, it makes the body roll.  The physics simulator will take into account all the parameters and the elapsed time to  calculate the new rotation value in radians.  In this case, we could change the 3D character's Y angle, borrowing the values from the  associated Body instance's Rotation property, in the Actor's subclass Update method.  As this property holds the angle in radians and as Balder's Matrix CreateRotationY  method requires an angle expressed in degrees, we have to convert the angle from radians  to degrees. As we do not want to check formulas in a physics book, we use the ToDegrees  function provided by Farseer.  _mesh.World = Balder.Core.Math.Matrix.CreateRotationY FarseerGames. FarseerPhysics.Mathematics.MathHelper.ToDegrees Body.Rotation  ;  We do not have to calculate the new angles. The physics simulator does this  job taking into account all the parameters and applying 2D physics laws.  [ 26 ]   Chapter 9  Why FarseerGames.FarseerPhysics.Mathematics.MathHelper  was used to call the ToDegrees function instead of MathHelper: The Balder.Core.Math namespace also has a definition for a MathHelper  class. Hence, we have two alternatives—removing the Balder.Core.Math  namespace for the class or using the full reference to FarseerGames's  MathHelper class. As we are also using Balder.Core.Math classes, we  used the full reference.  Translating 2D physics to a 3D world So far, we have been working with a 2D physics simulator to update 2 axes of our 3D world.  We have to do this because we do not have a complete 3D physics simulator working with  Balder or XBAP WPF 3D applications.  However, we can make some tricks to use a 2D physics engine to emulate a 3D world. We  can work with three 2-axis physics simulators  three instances of PhysicsSimulator .   Each instance can represent the following pairs of 3D world axes:        X and Y.  We have been working with this in the previous examples  X and Z Y and Z  The following figure shows the representation of a cube in the three pairs of 2 axis:  Y axis  X axis  Z axis  X and Y  Y and Z  X and Z  [ 26 ]   Adding Realistic Motions Using a Physics Engine  The following figure shows the different 2D planes that represent the parts of the cube in  each 2D physics simulator.  2D Physics simulator 1  2D Physics simulator 2  2D Physics simulator 3  X and Y  Y and Z  X and Z  Each physics simulator can apply forces, impulses, and torques to each of these planes. Each  engine can update just one axis.        X and Y—It updates the X-axis X and Z—It updates the Z-axis Y and Z—It updates the Y-axis  Using this technique, we can control the applied physics to three axes using three instances  of a 2D physics engine. It will not offer the same results as a real 3D engine, taking into  account the exact 3D model. However, it will provide the opportunity to apply simple  simulations of forces, impulses and rotations with rough results.  Instead of working with an exact cube, we would be working with a 3D geometry as shown:  Working with Farseer Physics Engine in XBAP WPF applications Everything we have learned so far about Farseer Physics Engine is also useful when working  with an XBAP WPF application. This engine is also available for WPF and it works exactly the  same way as explained for Silverlight and Balder.  [ 270 ]   Chapter 9  Have a go hero – circles are not rectangles Your project manager comes with a physics book on his hand. He discovered that you had  been using a rectangle to simulate the 2D physics for the UFO. Now, you have to change the  body factory to create a circle instead of a rectangle.  Luckily, Farseer allows the creation of circles calling the BodyFactory.Instance. CreateCircleBody method. However, it requires a ratio and mass as parameters,  instead of a width, a height, and a mass. Besides, you have to replace the call to  CreateRectangleGeom with CreateCircleGeom.  He also wants to play with the physics simulator, changing the values for its main parameters.  Add a new UFO using a circle body. Apply the forces, impulses, and torques to the existing  and the new UFO.  Add sliders to allow the player to change the gravity  assigning a new Vector2 through the  PhysicsSimulator instance Gravity property . Also let him change both the linear and  the rotational drag coefficients.  Have a go hero – applying particle systems Now, it's time to work with particle systems. Your project manager wants to test the  capabilities of the 2D physics engine to work with just the X-axis and the Y-axis of many  cubes. These cubes have to simulate a UFO's explosion.  You have to work with forces, impulses, torques, and gravity in order to make the boxes  move as shown in the following figure:  [ 271 ]   Adding Realistic Motions Using a Physics Engine  The force of gravity will help you to let the boxes go down.  Use a 3D DCC tool to create a simple box to use as the mesh. You will have to create a  subclass of Actor to represent the box and to create the relation with the Body instance.

Drag is:  Summary  We learned a lot in this chapter about simulating the laws of 2D and 3D physics. Specifically,  we were able to define gravitational force, mass, drag coefficients, and moment of inertia   to represent the physical properties of the bodies that define a model. We used a physics  engine to apply forces, impulses, and torques to 3D models. We took advantage of   object-oriented capabilities to add physics to existing 3D characters. We also understood  how to use a 2D engine to work in a 3D world.  Now that we've learned to use an engine to simulate physics for 3D characters in a 3D scene,  we're ready to apply artificial intelligence, which is the topic of the next chapter.  [ 273 ]    10  Applying Artificial Intelligence  In order to create competitive games, we must add some intelligence to the  characters and we have to be able to detect collisions between them. An UFO  has to be able to pursue a spaceship. A missile must be capable of chasing  a plane. A cat must try to catch a mouse. The real things move using some  intelligence. However, they also make mistakes. Hence, we have to add artificial  intelligence  AI  to our characters.  In this chapter, we will add action to the scenes. By reading it and following the exercises   we shall learn to:              Detect when two characters hit Define specific behaviors when the characters collide Use physics simulation to respond to collisions Add chasing capabilities to characters Add evasion capabilities to characters Control the intelligence used in the automated character's behavior  Detecting collisions between 3D characters  So far, we have been animating simple and complex 3D models in our 3D scenes, working  with forces, impulses, acceleration, and speed. We took advantage of a 2D physics engine  to add realistic movements and rotations to our 3D characters. However, in the real world,  objects collide and they react to these collisions according to certain properties governed by  physics and to the laws of 3D physics. Modern games must simulate real-life effects when 3D  characters collide. How can we detect collisions between our 3D characters and make them  react accordingly in Silverlight?   Applying Artificial Intelligence  We can do this by taking advantage of the collision detection capabilities offered by a  specialized physics engine. Using a physics engine, it is possible to detect collisions and to  make the 3D characters react according to their actual position, rotation, torque, force, and  impulse. This way, we can animate our 3D characters and simulate the reactions offered by  real-life collisions without worrying about the underlying formulas.  3D collision detection is a very complex problem. It involves very complex  algorithms that require complete access to the meshes, faces and polygons for  each 3D character. However, we want to keep things simple. As previously done  with the addition of physics to our 3D characters, we are going to reduce the  complexity of the mathematics involved in collision detection systems using  a parallel representation of the 3D world in the physics engine's geometries.  This is not going to be the most accurate 3D collision detection procedure.  Nevertheless, it will allow us to add responses to collisions without diving into  very complex algorithms.  Time for action – adding a second UFO Firstly, we are going to add a second UFO to our existing scene. This UFO must be able to  move and rotate using impulses, forces and torques, like the existing UFO.  1.	 Stay in the 3DInvadersSilverlight project. 2.	 Open Ufo.cs.cs. 3.

Add the following lines of code in the CheckKeyboard method, before the line    KeyboardManager.RemoveUpKeys  ;: if  KeyboardManager.IsKeyDown Key.D1     _ufo2.Body.ApplyImpulse new Vector2 -0.25f, -0.25f  ; if  KeyboardManager.IsKeyDown Key.D2     _ufo2.Body.ApplyForce new Vector2 0.05f, -0.5f  ; if  KeyboardManager.IsKeyDown Key.D3     _ufo2.Body.ApplyTorque -5f ;  8.	 Override the Loaded method to set the initial positions for both the UFO's mesh    and the UFO's 2D body:: public override void Loaded   {   base.Loaded  ;      Set the initial position once the models were loaded   _ufo2.SetPosition 20, -2, 0 ; }  9.	 Build and run the solution. The default web browser will appear displaying the two  spaceships, and the two UFOs made of bricks  one on the left, and the other on the  right . Both UFOs will move down through the 3D space, pulled by the Earth's   gravitational force, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 277 ]   Applying Artificial Intelligence  10.	 Click on the web browser's viewport to activate its focus. Press the F+2 key   combination and keep it down for a few seconds, applying a force to both UFOs  at the same time. During the first few seconds, both UFOs will try to resist the  gravitational force that pulls them down. After these first few seconds, both UFOs  will break the gravitational force, and they will begin to move up in opposite   horizontal directions, as shown in the following screenshot:  11.	 Now, press the I+1 key combination and keep it down for a few seconds, applying   an impulse to both the UFOs at the same time. Then, release the keys. During these  few seconds, both UFOs will seem to jump up and in opposite horizontal directions.  When you release both keys, their speed will slow down because the drag force is  resisting the UFOs' movements. Also, the gravitational force will pull them   down again, as shown in the following diagram:  What just happened? Adding just a few lines of code, you could simulate and control the real-life physics for two  UFOs at the same time. Now, both the UFOs display realistic movement through the air and  you are ready to detect collisions between them.  [ 27 ]   First, we added the SetPosition public method to the Ufo class in order to change the  X, Y, and Z coordinates for the mesh and set the X and Y coordinates for the Ufo's 2D body.  Then, we added code to the Initialize method to create the new instance and add it as  an actor to our game and to the physics simulator.  We had to override the Loaded method to call the SetPosition method for the second  UFO, once the models were loaded.  Chapter 10  This was necessary because the Ufo's constructor does not load the mesh.  It creates the body and the geometry to represent the mesh in the physics  simulator but it does not load the model. Hence, we had to make sure the model  was already loaded because the SetPosition method changes the positions  for both the mesh and the body.  We added code to the CheckKeyboard method to apply an impulse  1 , a force  2 , or a  torque  3  to the new UFO according to the pressed key. We specified the opposite horizontal  direction that the first UFO applied for the impulse, the force, and the torque.  This way, we can press many keys at the same time to impulse both UFOs and make them  collide. Once we have defined the physics simulator, the actors, their bodies and geometries,  it is very easy to add new actors to the game using our simple object-oriented approach.  Time for action – detecting collisions between 3D characters Your project manager does not want the UFOs to explode when they crash. He wants you to  use the physics simulator to make them rotate and bounce when they collide.  Now, we are going to take advantage of the physics engine's collision detection capabilities:  1.	 Stay in the 3DInvadersSilverlight project. 2.	 Open Ufo.cs.cs. 3.	 Add the following public static constant to identify the kind of 3D character    related to a geometry: public static string Tag = "UFO";  4.	 Add the following private method to check the geometry that collides with the    Ufo's instance:: private bool OnCollision Geom geom1, Geom geom2, ContactList                                                        contactList  {   if     string  geom1.Tag  == Tag  &&    string  geom2.Tag  ==  Tag    [ 27 ]   Applying Artificial Intelligence         Both geometries represent an UFO     return true;   else     return false; }  5.	 Replace the line that assigns a width value in the constructor with the following   one.  We must be more accurate because we want them to respond to a collision. : : Width = 3f;  6.	 Add the following lines of code before the end of the aforementioned    class's constructor:    Use Geom.Tag to name the geometry Geom.Tag = Tag;    Add a collision event handler Geom.OnCollision += OnCollision;  7.	 Build and run the solution. The default web browser will appear displaying the two   spaceships, and the two UFOs made of bricks. Press the I+1 key combination and  keep them down, applying an impulse to both the UFOs at the same time, until they  are about to collide. Release the keys. Once the UFOs crash, they will begin rotating   and bouncing, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 20 ]   8.	 Run the application many times, pressing the  previously mentioned keys to make   the UFOs collide with different impulses. You will be able to see the UFOs rotating as   if they were dancing, as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 10  9.	 Change the friction coefficient  FrictionCoefficient property's value  for    the geometry  Geom instances  that defines the edges of the UFO model   representation in the 2D physics simulator. Run the application many times   using the following values:s:        0.5f 1.5f 3.5f  10.	 Make the UFOs collide with each different value. Using the higher friction   coefficient, the UFOs will move up together once they collide, because it is difficult  to move each one relative to the other, as shown in the following screenshot::  11.	 Restore the original friction coefficient value and run the experience again. You will  be able to understand the friction coefficient incidence on collisions controlled by   the physics simulator.  What just happened? When the UFOs collide, the physics simulator updates the bodies according to their  properties—their friction coefficient and the combination of forces, impulses, and torques  applied. The response offered by the application when the UFOs crash is very attractive  because they behave like real objects colliding.  [ 21 ]   Applying Artificial Intelligence  Working with advanced responses to collisions  By default, when two geometries collide with each other, the physics simulator triggers a  collision response. An arbiter calculates the impulses to be applied to each body associated  with a geometry that has collided. The impulses create reactions to the collision, trying to  reproduce the behavior of real physics.  As we had already created a geometry  a Geom instance  and associated it to a body  a Body  instance  to represent the UFO's mesh in the 2D physics simulator, we did not have to code  specific collision detection algorithms. As the physics simulator applies forces, impulses,  and torques, it updates the positions and rotations of the bodies and executes collision  detection algorithms to determine whether different geometries collide with each other. As  aforementioned, if this happens, an arbiter calculates the impulses to provide a response to  the collision and it fires the OnCollision event on the geometry. Therefore, we added an  event handler  CollisionEventHandler  to the Geom instance in the Ufo's constructor:  Geom.OnCollision += OnCollision;  When two geometries hit each other and we are using the physics simulator's default  options, the code programmed in the OnCollision event handler method must evaluate  the geometries that collide and return a bool value indicating whether to make the collision  happen or not. In our example, we were just working with two UFO's. However, in a more  complex game, there will be dozens of different 3D characters and geometries colliding at  the same time. As we are using a 2D physics simulator to detect collisions in a parallel 3D  world, the event handler is not prepared to work with 3D meshes. Thus, we must identify  the geometries. We used the flexible and well-known Tag property to assign a string that  identifies all the geometries related to UFOs:  Geom.Tag = Tag;  Using a string to identify the geometries is not exactly a best practice for all the  cases. When working with dozens of geometries, it would be more convenient to  work with an enum or numeric identifiers. We can also use the Tag property to  hold a Dictionary with multiple data. It can allow us to look up any custom  data or objects from the geometry's Tag property.  The OnCollision event handler receives three parameters, the two geometries    Geom instances  that collide and a list of contacts  ContactList :  private bool OnCollision Geom geom1, Geom geom2, ContactList                                                    contactList   [ 22 ]   Chapter 10  We wanted our UFOs to offer a response when colliding with the other UFOs. Therefore, we  evaluated the Tag property values for both the geometries. If both were related to an UFO,  we returned true to allow the physics simulator to update the bodies with the impulses  generated by the collision response:  if     string  geom1.Tag  == Tag  &&    string  geom2.Tag  == Tag     return true;  Using this event, we can determine the collision responses according to the geometries that  collide and their points of contact.  We update our 3D world considering the representation in the physics simulator's 2D   world. The physics simulator uses its geometries to detect collisions, as shown in the   following diagram:  Controlling collision moments using events The 2D physics simulator fires additional events when a geometry hits another geometry.  Creating additional event handlers allows us to have more control over the responses when  collisions occur.  [ 23 ]   Applying Artificial Intelligence  After an enabled collision occurs, the impulses applied to each body can make both  geometries to separate. When the geometries are no longer hitting after a collision, the  physics simulator fires the OnSeparation event for the geometries. The OnSeparation  event handler receives two parameters—the two geometries  Geom instances  that are not  colliding anymore:  private void OnSeparation Geom geom1, Geom geom2   Hence, we can add a specific behavior for the characters when the collision ends.  The physics simulator uses advanced 2D collision detection algorithms to reduce the work  needed to detect geometries that hit or intersect. There is a broad phase collision detection,  which uses efficient algorithms to detect whether geometries are colliding or not. When  the engine detects a collision in this phase, it fires the OnBroadPhaseCollision on the  physics simulator  the PhysicsSimulator instance . The OnBroadPhaseCollision  event handler receives two parameters—the two geometries  Geom instances  that   are colliding:  private bool OnBroadPhaseCollision Geom geom1, Geom geom2   When two geometries collide and we are using the physics simulator's default options, the  code programmed in the OnBroadPhaseCollision event handler method, must evaluate  the geometries that collide and return a bool value indicating whether to let the engine  create an arbiter and go into the narrow phase collision or not. By default, if there is no  event handler programmed for OnBroadPhaseCollision, the engine will go into the  narrow phase collision and it will fire the previously explained OnCollision event on   the geometry.  Sometimes, we do not want to go into the narrow phase collision when some geometries  collide. If we can make this decision without needing to know the list of contacts, we should  program the OnBroadPhaseCollision to evaluate the geometries involved and return  false. Creating the arbiter and going into the narrow phase collision requires a huge  amount of work. Thus, it is important to avoid wasting processing power, especially when   we have dozens of geometries being analyzed for each frame.  If the OnBroadPhaseCollision event handler returns false, the simulator neither  creates the arbiter nor fires the OnCollision event for the geometries involved in this  collision. Therefore, it does not apply impulses to the related bodies.  We can also disable the collision response for a specific geometry by setting  its CollisionResponseEnabled property to false. In this case, the  geometry will not respond to any collisions.  [ 24 ]   Chapter 10  Working with collision categories The physics simulator offers the possibility to group the geometries that can collide into  categories. This technique simplifies and optimizes the collision detection process and the  code programmed in the previously explained event handlers.  We can specify one or more collision categories for a geometry  a Geom instance  assigning   a value to its CollisionCategories property. The CollisionCategory enum offers   31 categories in addition to None  do not collide with any geometry  and All  collide with   all categories . By default, its value is CollisionCategory.All.  The CollisionCategories property works in combination with the CollidesWith  property. It specifies the collision categories that will respond to collisions with  this geometry. It also uses the CollisionCategory enum and its default value is  CollisionCategory.All  collide with all categories .  For example, the following lines define that a geometry belongs to the collision category  number 2 and it will respond to collisions with geometries belonging to categories 1, 2,   and 3:  Geom.CollisionCategories = CollisionCategory.Cat2; Geom.CollidesWith = CollisionCategory.Cat1 & CollisionCategory.Cat2 &                                                CollisionCategory.Cat3;  We can also use bitwise operations to indicate that a geometry collides with all categories  but category number 5, as in the following line:  Geom.CollidesWith = CollisionCategory.All & ~CollisionCategory.Cat5;  Using engines to improve collision detection precision Collision detection is one of the most complex problems related to 3D game development.  We are taking advantage of the power offered by Farseer Physics Engine 2.1, a 2D physics  simulator, to add 2D collision detection capabilities to our 3D world. However, our collision  detection is not as accurate as expected. If we want to improve the collision detection  precision in a 3D world, we would need to emulate a complete 3D world working with three  2 axes physics simulators. This technique adds a lot of complexity to the game. However, it is  not an impossible mission.  [ 25 ]   Applying Artificial Intelligence  A real 3D collision detection algorithm should perform a broad phase collision detection  using 3D bounding boxes. The following diagram shows the UFO's model represented as   a 3D bounding box:  If the broad phase collision detection detects a hit using the 3D bounding boxes, a narrow  phase collision detection should be performed between these 3D models. The algorithm  should test each polygon in the 3D model located near the hit area, using their current  positions in the 3D world, and detect intersections with all the other polygons in the hit area  belonging to other 3D models. The following diagram shows the polygons that represent the  mesh for the UFO's model:  As these algorithms are very complex and they require important optimizations, we used  the 2D physics simulator to keep thing simple. Using the appropriate geometries, the physics  simulator is able to add specific behaviors when the models collide. However, it requires a lot  of work to create the geometries that accurately represent the model in 2 axes.  Have a go hero – 3D Moon Lander There is a great opportunity to create a small game remake—a 3D Moon Lander. You already  know how to work with gravity, physics, and collision detection. You also have a 3D spaceship  model. You should be able to create a 3D Moon Lander game in a few hours. You will have to  use everything we have learned so far.  The idea is very simple. A spaceship has to land safely over a specified area. The player can  control the engine  impulses and forces  to beat gravity force and to move the ship in the X  and Y axis. You will use 3D models, but you will just work with the X and Y axis to move the  ship. The mouse must move and rotate the camera to allow the player to watch the scene  from different angles.  [ 26 ]   Chapter 10  The spaceship does not have to collide with three UFOs that will be flying over the   moon's surface. If this happens, the spaceship will be destroyed. The UFOs can collide  between themselves.  The main goal is to land the spaceship safely with a certain maximum horizontal and   vertical speed  you can check the physics simulator body's LinearVelocity property—a  2D vector . If the speed is too high when touching the landing area, the spaceship will   be destroyed.  If the spaceship touches the rocks  3D spheres represented as circle geometries in the  physics simulator , it explodes.  You can use collision groups  collision categories  to detect whether the spaceship is colliding  with the landing area  the small rocks  or with the big harmful rocks.  Create a version using Balder and Farseer Physics Engine, running in Silverlight. Then,   create another version using an XBAP WPF application. Use the previously explained   object-oriented designs to create the classes for the 3D characters.  The following diagram shows the main characters and a simple diagram to understand the  game's components:  [ 27 ]   Applying Artificial Intelligence  The safe landing zone is composed of six small rocks. You can create a collision category for  these six models and their geometries.  The big and the small rocks are not pulled by gravity. Remember to set their  IgnoreGravity property to false.  The following diagram shows the possible collision groups to understand how to distribute  the geometries related to 3D models in the game:  You can do it. Your project manager has already sold the game to an online gaming community.  Using artificial intelligence in games to control   3D characters  So far, we have been adding physics and collision detection capabilities to the 3D characters  in our 3D scenes. We were able to simulate real-life effects when 3D characters collide.  However, games require some life and action. Players want to play against the computer.  They want to evade an enemy that is threatening their main character. How can we create  intelligent characters capable of chasing or evading other characters?  [ 2 ]   We can do this by adding artificial intelligence  AI  algorithms to our characters. We have  to add chasing algorithms. If there is a character chasing, there should be another evading.  However, real-life situations are not perfect. If we create perfect algorithms, the computer is  always going to win. Most players are not as smart as Garry Kasparov  the well-known chess  champion . He needed IBM to create a specialized supercomputer, Deep Blue, to beat him.  Besides, he was able to beat many supercomputers. We cannot create unbeatable games.  They would be really boring for the average player.  Chapter 10  AI algorithms have to introduce random imperfections according to a  predefined skill level. This way, the player is going to be able to win sometimes.  This imperfection  noise  is one of the most complex topics related to AI. We  have to make the characters wander under certain circumstances, instead of  chasing or evading. We have to introduce random situations.  Time for action – using chasing algorithms Your project manager wants to test the results offered by many AI algorithms. He wants you  to create an AI algorithm to make one UFO chase the other. However, the algorithm has to  make the UFO wander randomly in the middle of the chase.  Now, we are going to add AI to the game in order to make one UFO pursue the other:  1.	 Stay in the 3DInvadersSilverlight project. 2.	 Open Ufo.cs.cs. 3.	 Add the following enum to define AI states for the Ufo's instances    after the namespace and before the class definition : public enum UfoAIState {      Wandering because the other character is too far away   Wandering,      Chasing another character   Chasing,      Evading another character   Evading,      It is not necessary to chase or evade the other character  anymore   Captured }  4.	 Add the following field to determine whether the Ufo is going to chase or evade:  public bool Evade = false;  [ 2 ]   Applying Artificial Intelligence  5.	 Add the following property to hold the enemy's instance:  public Ufo Enemy { get; set; } Ufo Enemy { get; set; }  6.	 Add the following protected variable to hold the AI state:  protected UfoAIState _state = UfoAIState.Wandering;;  7.	 Add the following protected variable to hold a random number generator instance:  protected Random _random = new Random  ;  8.	 Add the following protected method to make the character randomly wander:  protected void AIWander   {   _state = UfoAIState.Wandering;   switch  _random.Next 1, 4     {     case 1:           Body.ApplyImpulse new Vector2 0.5f, 0  ;           break;     case 2:           Body.ApplyImpulse new Vector2 -0.5f, 0  ;           break;     case 3:           Body.ApplyImpulse new Vector2 0, -0.5f  ;           break;     case 4:           Body.ApplyImpulse new Vector2 0, 0.5f  ;           break;   } }  9.	 Add the following method to make the character pursue an enemy taking into    account its distance in two axes: protected void AIChase Ufo enemy  {      We use a parameter in order to leave this procedure prepared  for additional enemies   _state = UfoAIState.Chasing;   Vector2 distance =  Body.Position - enemy.Body.Position ;   if   Math.Abs distance.X   >  Math.Abs distance.Y      {     if  distance.X > 0        Body.ApplyImpulse new Vector2 -0.5f, 0  ;     else       Body.ApplyImpulse new Vector2 0.5f, 0  ;  [ 20 ]   Chapter 10  10.	 Add the following empty protected method, as we do not want the character    11.	 Add the following protected method to call the previously added method that      }   else   {     if  distance.Y > 0        Body.ApplyImpulse new Vector2 0, -0.5f  ;     else       Body.ApplyImpulse new Vector2 0, 0.5f  ;   } }  to evade its hunter yet. protected void AIEvade Ufo enemy  { }  uses some AI to chase, evade, or wander: protected void ApplyAIAlgorithms   {   if  _state == UfoAIState.Captured         Nothing to do     return;   if  Evade    {     if  _random.Next 1, 5  == 4           A lazy evader  wandering too many times        AIWander  ;     else       AIEvade Enemy ;   }   else   {     if  _random.Next 1, 10  == 4        AIWander  ;     else       AIChase Enemy ;   } }  12.	 Add the following line of code after the line base.Update  ; in the Update   method.  We have to apply the AI algorithms to the Ufo instance. : ApplyAIAlgorithms  ;;  [ 21 ]   Applying Artificial Intelligence  13.	 Open InvadersGame.cs.cs. 14.	 Add the following lines of code before the end of the Initialize method to  define the enemy for each Ufo instance and define its role, setting the value   for their Evade field: _ufo1.Enemy = _ufo2; _ufo1.Evade = false; _ufo2.Enemy = _ufo1; _ufo2.Evade = true;  15.	 Replace the line that sets the initial position for _ufo2 in the Loaded method with    the following one.  We want the UFOs to be nearer. : _ufo2.SetPosition 8, -4, 0 ;  16.	 Build and run the solution. The default web browser will appear, displaying the two  UFOs. The UFO located on the left will begin pursuing the other UFO, which will be  always wandering. However, the chase will not be perfect, because the hunter is  also going to wander sometimes during the chase. The hunter will finally collide with  the other UFO and it will begin pushing it around the scene, as if they were dancing,   as shown in the following screenshot:  17.	 Run the application several times. You will notice that the chase behavior is different   each time, because we have added a random behavior in the AI algorithms.  18.	 Use the keys to apply impulses, forces, and torques to the UFO that is being pursued. 19.	 Use the keys to apply impulses to both UFOs and watch the hunter's behavior.  [ 22 ]   Chapter 10  What just happened? Your project manager is very happy, because you were able to add AI to the game. One UFO  tries to hunt the other and each time the application runs, it offers a different behavior. This  kind of AI is great for a game like the one you are trying to develop.  We added a very simple AI algorithm to one UFO. It can calculate the distance with the other  UFO and pursue it. It has intelligence. However, we also added a random lack of common  sense to this intelligence. Sometimes, the UFO that is chasing the other does not follow the  most convenient path and it adds an impulse to a random direction. We worked with 2 axes  to keep things simple. We can apply a similar technique working with 3 axes.  We worked with impulses because we wanted to let the physics simulator control the speed  and the overall movement of our characters. Thus, gravitational force and everything related  to physics is still working.  Working with states for the characters While working with AI algorithms, it is very important to use states. Sometimes, we have to  know what the character is doing and why is it doing so. Clear states offer us this information  and they let the algorithm take decisions considering those states.  We defined four possible states for an UFO:          Wandering Chasing Evading Captured  The Update method now calls the ApplyAIAlgorithms procedure. It is the heart of the  UFO's automatic behavior. It makes the UFO wander when a random number generator  returns a certain number. By changing the range for this random number generator, we can  define skill levels. The higher the probability that the UFO wanders during the chase, the  easier it is for the other UFO to escape successfully:  if  _random.Next 1, 10  == 4    AIWander  ; else   AIChase Enemy ;  If the random number generator, between 1 and 10, returns a 4, the UFO will wander  without intelligence.  [ 23 ]   Applying Artificial Intelligence  If it is a number that is not 4, it will apply the necessary impulses to chase the enemy. We  send the Ufo instance to chase as a parameter because it will make it simpler to call this  method many times for different enemies.  Each AI method changes the AI state for the UFO.  Pursuing an enemy The AIChase method is very easy to understand. It changes the state for the UFO and it  then calculates the distance between its body and the enemy's body:  Vector2 distance =  Body.Position - enemy.Body.Position ;  Once it knows the distance, it removes the sign from the distances to take decisions  according to them. It checks the axis on which the enemy is farther away and it tries to  reduce the distance on that axis:  if   Math.Abs distance.X   >  Math.Abs distance.Y     It applies impulses using a fixed number only on one axis at a time.   if  distance.X > 0    Body.ApplyImpulse new Vector2 -0.5f, 0  ; else   Body.ApplyImpulse new Vector2 0.5f, 0  ;  In this case, we used numbers in the code to apply the different impulses  and to specify the random situations. It is convenient to use different  variables for each axis. This way, we are able to change their values to  easily create different skill levels.  Generating and controlling random situations As previously explained, a good AI algorithm has to include random situations. It is good to  see the UFO losing its enemy and then going back to chase it again. It looks realistic, and we  want to create realistic scenes in our games.  During the pursuit, based on fast and accurate distance calculations, under certain random  conditions, we call the AIWander method to apply a random impulse to the UFO. This  impulse could either favor the chase or not favor it.  [ 24 ]   Chapter 10  We used another random number between 1 and 4 to decide which direction to apply the  impulse in:  switch  _random.Next 1, 4    Adding more complexity to this method, we can create behaviors that are even more realistic  and offer many skill levels to a game based on pursuits.  Time for action – using evasion algorithms You created a very good chase algorithm. It is time to make the other UFO evade its hunter.  Now, we are going to add more AI to the game in order to make one UFO run away from   the other:  1.	 Stay in the 3DInvadersSilverlight project. 2.	 Open Ufo.cs.cs. 3.	 Replace the AIEvade method with the following:  protected void AIEvade Ufo enemy  {   Vector2 distance =  Body.Position - enemy.Body.Position ;   if   Math.Abs distance.X  <  Width * 2                                  Math.Abs distance.Y  <  Height * 2      {        The Ufo can wander without problems because the enemy is         too far     _state = UfoAIState.Wandering;     AIWander  ;   }   _state = UfoAIState.Evading;   if   Math.Abs distance.X   >  Math.Abs distance.Y      {     if  distance.X > 0        Body.ApplyImpulse new Vector2 0.2f, 0  ;     else       Body.ApplyImpulse new Vector2 -0.2f, 0  ;   }   else   {     if  distance.Y > 0        Body.ApplyImpulse new Vector2 0, 0.2f  ;     else       Body.ApplyImpulse new Vector2 0, -0.2f  ;   } }  [ 25 ]   Applying Artificial Intelligence  4.	 Build and run the solution. The default web browser will appear displaying the two  UFOs. The UFO located on the left will begin pursuing the other UFO, which will be  wandering until the hunter gets near it. Then, the pursuit begins with two intelligent   but also lazy characters, as shown in the following screenshot:  5.	 As the UFO that evades the hunter applies lower impulses, the hunter will finally   collide with the other UFO and it will begin pushing it around the scene.  6.	 Run the application many times. You will notice that the behavior is different each   time one UFO pursues the other, because we have added random behaviors   to all the AI algorithms.  7.	 Use the keys to apply impulses, forces, and torques to the UFO that is being pursued   and watch how the hunter is always trying to chase this UFO, as shown in the   following screenshot:  8.	 Use the keys to apply impulses to both the UFOs and analyze the behavior for both    the hunter and the evader.  [ 26 ]   Chapter 10  What just happened? You could create realistic AI algorithms. The chase between the two UFOs behaves randomly.  However, your project manager is adding more tasks to your games. Now, he knows you can  add artificial intelligence combined with physics simulation to any character.  We added another very simple AI algorithm to the other UFO. It can calculate the distance  with the other chasing UFO and evade it. It has intelligence. However, we also added  a random lack of common sense to this intelligence and we used a lower speed for  the impulses. Sometimes, the UFO that is evading the other, does not follow the most  convenient path and it adds an impulse to a random direction.  Evading an enemy We completed the code for the AIEvade method. It is very easy to understand. It adds some  logic to the previously explained AIChase method. However, it works in a very similar way,  using an inverse logic  evading the enemy instead of chasing it .  It changes the state for the UFO and it then calculates the distance between its body and  the enemy's body. Once it knows the distance of separation, it waits until the enemy is at a  certain distance to begin running away from it:  if   Math.Abs distance.X  <  Width * 2     Math.Abs distance.Y  <                                                          Height * 2    {   _state = UfoAIState.Wandering;   AIWander  ; }  If the enemy is near the UFO, it takes the absolute values of the distances to make decisions  according to them. It checks the axis on which the enemy is nearest and it tries to increase  the distance on this axis:  if   Math.Abs distance.X   >  Math.Abs distance.Y     It applies impulses using a fixed number only in one axis at a time. The logic of the code is  inverse of the one found in the AIChase method:  if  distance.X > 0    Body.ApplyImpulse new Vector2 0.2f, 0  ; else   Body.ApplyImpulse new Vector2 -0.2f, 0  ;  In this case, we used lower impulses. Hence, if there are no additional impulses  applied, the hunter will always chase this UFO.  [ 27 ]   Applying Artificial Intelligence  The advantages of using an AI engine We used simple but efficient algorithms to add some AI to the game. However, AI algorithms  can become really complex when working with dozens of characters in an interactive scene.  Therefore, it is very convenient to create an AI framework or an AI engine.  An AI engine can encapsulate all the needs for adding realistic behaviors to our characters.  For example, the chase and evade techniques are nearly the same. They are opposite  behaviors. It is very easy to generalize and encapsulate these algorithms.  While working with complex games, an AI engine is necessary to simplify the addition of skill  levels and to allow the player to tailor the game to their skill level.  Have a go hero – adding complex AI algorithms Do you remember that your project manager has a Ph.D. in Physics? He has many ideas  about complex AI algorithms and he wants you to add them to the games.  He wants you to create a spaceship character, encapsulating its behavior. UFOs will chase   the spaceships.  You have to improve the existing AI algorithms to work with more than one enemy. The  player has to control one spaceship. A second spaceship is going to be controlled by the  computer, using evasion algorithms.  A dozen of UFOs have to chase the spaceships. You have to change the state of each  spaceship when it is chased by an UFO.  Do not forget to work with forces, impulses, torques, and gravity.  Pop quiz – working with collision detection and artificial intelligence  1.  When two 2D geometries hit, the first event fired by the physics simulator instance   before creating the arbiter is:  a.

Summary  We have learnt a lot in this chapter about detecting collisions between characters and  adding action to our games. Specifically, we were able to determine whether a collision has  occurred between two characters. We used AI algorithms to simulate realistic behaviors and  to give the player the chance to win. We created chasing, evasion, and wandering algorithms  and we added them to existing 3D characters. We also understood how to generate and  control random situations.  Now that we've learnt to detect collisions and to apply artificial intelligence to win, we're  ready to apply special effects, which is the topic of the next chapter.  [ 2 ]    11  Applying Special Effects  A 3D game must be attractive. It has to offer amazing effects for the main  characters and in the background. A spaceship has to fly through a meteor  shower. An asteroid belt has to draw waves while a UFO pursues a spaceship.  A missile should make a plane explode. The real world shows us things moving  everywhere. Most of these scenes, however, aren't repetitive sequences. Hence,  we have to combine great designs, artificial intelligence  AI , and advanced  physics to create special effects.  In this chapter, we will add special effects to the scenes. By reading this chapter and  following the exercises we will learn to:              Add many background models, adding life to the game Control many independent backgrounds Simulate fluids with movement Work with multiple concurrent physics simulators Use advanced physics simulation to create waves Learn to encapsulate complex effects using classes  Working with 3D characters in the background  So far, we have added physics, collision detection capabilities, life, and action to our 3D  scenes. We were able to simulate real-life effects for the collision of two 3D characters by  adding some artificial intelligence. However, we need to combine this action with additional  effects to create a realistic 3D world. Players want to move the camera while playing so that  they can watch amazing effects. They want to be part of each 3D scene as if it were a real life  situation. How can we create complex and realistic backgrounds capable of adding realistic  behavior to the game?   Applying Special Effects  We can do this combining everything we have learned so far with a good object-oriented  design. We have to create random situations combined with more advanced physics. We  have to add more 3D characters with movement to the scenes. We must add complexity   to the backgrounds.   We can work with many independent physics engines to work with parallel  worlds. In real-life, there are concurrent and parallel words. We have to  reproduce this behavior in our 3D scenes.  Time for action – adding a transition to start the game Your project manager does not want the game to start immediately. He wants you to add a  button in order to allow the player to start the game by clicking on it. As you are using Balder,  adding a button is not as simple as expected.  We are going to add a button to the main page, and we are going to change Balder's default  game initialization:  1.	 Stay in the 3DInvadersSilverlight project. 2.	 Expand App.xaml in the Solution Explorer and open App.xaml.cs––the C code    for App.xaml.  3.	 Comment the following line of code  we are not going to use Balder's services    in this class :   using Balder.Silverlight.Services;  4.	 Comment the following line of code in the event handler for the Application_  Startup event, after the line this.RootVisual = new MainPage  ;:   TargetDevice.Initialize   ;  5.	 Open the XAML code for MainPage.xaml and add the following lines of code after  the line    You will see a   button with the title Start the game. :   <Button x:Name="btnStartGame"          Content="Start the game!"          Canvas.Left="200" Canvas.Top="20"          Width="200" Height="30" Click="btnStartGame_Click">    6.	 Now, expand MainPage.xaml in the Solution Explorer and open   MainPage.xaml.cs––the C code for MainPage.xaml.  [ 302 ]   Chapter 11  7.	 Add the following line of code at the beginning  As we are going to use many of    Balder's classes and interfaces. : using Balder.Silverlight.Services;  8.	 Add the following lines of code to program the event handler for the button's   Click event  this code will initialize the game using Balder's services : private void btnStartGame_Click object sender, RoutedEventArgs e  {   btnStartGame.Visibility = Visibility.Collapsed;   TargetDevice.Initialize   ; }  9.	 Build and run the solution. Click on the Start the game! button and the UFOs will   begin their chase game. The button will make a transition to start the game,   as shown in the following screenshots:  What just happened? You could use a Start the game! button to start a game using Balder's services. Now, you will  be able to offer the player more control over some parameters before starting the game.  We commented the code that started the game during the application start-up. Then, we  added a button on the main page  MainPage . The code programmed in its Click event  handler initializes the desired Balder.Core.Game subclass  InvadersGame  using just   one line:  TargetDevice.Initialize   ;  This initialization adds a new specific Canvas as another layout root's child, controlled by  Balder to render the 3D scenes. Thus, we had to make some changes to add a simple button  to control this initialization.  [ 303 ]   Applying Special Effects  Time for action – creating a low polygon count meteor model The 3D digital artists are creating models for many aliens. They do not have the time to  create simple models. Hence, they teach you to use Blender and 3D Studio Max to create  simple models with low polygon count. Your project manager wants you to add dozens of  meteors, to the existing chase game. A gravitational force must attract these meteors and  they have to appear in random initial positions in the 3D world.  First, we are going to create a low polygon count meteor using 3D Studio Max. Then, we are  going to add a texture based on a PNG image and export the 3D model to the ASE format,  compatible with Balder. As previously explained, we have to do this in order to export the  ASE format with a bitmap texture definition enveloping the meshes.  We can also use Blender or any other 3D DCC tool to create this model. We have  already learned how to export an ASE format from Blender. Thus, this time, we  are going to learn the necessary steps to do it using 3D Studio Max.  1.	 Start 3D Studio Max and create a new scene. 2.	 Add a sphere with six segments. 3.	 Locate the sphere in the scene's center. 4.	 Use the Uniform Scale tool to resize the low polygon count sphere to 11.329 in    the three axis, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 304 ]   5.	 Click on the Material Editor button. 6.	 Click on the first material sphere, on the Material Editor window's upper-left corner. 7.	 Click on the small square at the right side of the Diffuse color rectangle, as shown in    the following screenshot:  Chapter 11  8.	 Select Bitmap from the list shown in the Material Map Browser window that    pops up and click on OK.  9.	 Select the PNG file to be used as a texture to envelope the sphere. You can use   Bricks.PNG, previously downloaded from http:  www.freefoto.com . You  just need to add a reference to a bitmap file. Then, click on Open. The Material  Editor preview panel will show a small sphere thumbnail enveloped by the selected   bitmap, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 305 ]   Applying Special Effects  10.	 Drag the new material and drop it on the sphere. If you are facing problems,  remember that the 3D digital artist created a similar sphere a few days ago   and he left the meteor.max file in the following folder    C:\Silverlight3D\Invaders3D\3DModels\METEOR .  11.	 Save the file using the name meteor.max in the previously mentioned folder. 12.	 Now, you have to export the model to the ASE format with the reference to the   texture. Therefore, select File  Export and choose ASCII Scene Export  *.ASE  on  the Type combo box. Select the aforementioned folder, enter the file name   meteor.ase and click on Save.  13.	 Check the following options in the ASCII Export dialog box.  They are unchecked    by default :        Mesh Normals Mapping Coordinates Vertex Colors  The dialog box should be similar to the one shown in the following screenshot:  [ 306 ]   Chapter 11  14.	 Click on OK. Now, the model is available as an ASE 3D model with reference to the  texture. You will have to change the absolute path for the bitmap that defines the  texture in order to allow Balder to load the model in a Silverlight application.  What just happened? We used a different 3D DCC tool  3D Studio Max  to add a texture based on an image bitmap  and link it to a material to envelope the meshes. Then we converted the 3D model to the ASE  file format, using 3D Studio Max ASCII Export.  Now, we know how to export models enveloped by textures in both Blender  and 3D Studio Max. We do not need 3D digital artists anymore to create simple  models. However, we do need them to create complex models.  Time for action – from 3D Studio Max to Silverlight Now, we are going to add the meteor's ASE 3D model exported from 3D Studio Max in our  Silverlight game with Balder's help.  1.	 Open the 3DInvadersSilverlight project. 2.	 Right-click on the Assets folder and select  menu that appears.  and select Add  Existing item… from the context    3.	 Go to the folder in which you saved the meteor's 3D model, including the  link to the texture, in the ASE format  C:\Silverlight3D\Invaders3D\ 3DModels\METEOR . Select the new ASE file  meteor.ase  and click on Add.  4.	 Click on the ASE file added in the previous step. Change its Build Action property    to Resource.  5.	 Open the code for the recently added ASE file  meteor.ase . 6.	 Search for the line that begins with *BITMAP.  [ 307 ]   Applying Special Effects  7.	 Replace the full path and the file name that follows the *BITMAP  C:\  Silverlight3D\Invaders3D\3DModels\SPACESHIP01\Textures\Bricks. png  with the desired PNG bitmap, Bricks.png, as shown in the   following screenshot:  What just happened? The meteor's 3D model is ready to be loaded using Balder. We added it to the assets and we  changed the texture's path.  Time for action – creating a subclass for a 3D meteor Now, we are going to create a specialized subclass of Actor  Balder.Core.Runtime. Actor  to define a meteor. Each meteor will be a 3D character.  1.	 Stay in the 3DInvadersSilverlight project. 2.	 Create a new class—Meteor  a subclass of Actor —using the following declaration:  public class Ufo : Actor  [ 30 ]   3.	 Add the following lines of code at the beginning  as we are going to use many    Chapter 11  classes and interfaces from Balder and Farseer Physics Engine : using Balder.Core; using Balder.Core.Geometries; using Balder.Core.Math; using Balder.Core.Runtime; using FarseerGames.FarseerPhysics; using FarseerGames.FarseerPhysics.Collisions; using FarseerGames.FarseerPhysics.Dynamics; using FarseerGames.FarseerPhysics.Factories; using FarseerGames.FarseerPhysics.Mathematics;  4.	 Add the following protected variables to hold references for the RealTimeGame    and the Scene instances: protected RealTimeGame _game; protected Scene _scene;   an instance of Mesh : protected Mesh _mesh;  5.	 Add the following protected variable to hold the meteor's 3D model    6.	 Add the following public properties related to the physics simulator:  public Body Body { get; private set; } public Geom Geom { get; private set; } public float Radius { get; private set; } public float Mass { get; private set; }  7.	 Add the following constructor with three parameters, the RealTimeGame,    and the PhysicsSimulator instances:  the Scene, and the public Meteor RealTimeGame game, Scene scene,                PhysicsSimulator physicsSimulator  {   _game = game;   _scene = scene;   Radius = 1f;   Mass = 1f;      Create the body and set its linear drag coefficient   Body = BodyFactory.Instance.CreateCircleBody physicsSimulator,                                                      Radius, Mass ;   Body.LinearDragCoefficient = 0.4f;      The meteor is going to rotate forever   Body.RotationalDragCoefficient = 0f;      Create the geometry  Geom  and set its friction coefficient  [ 30 ]   Applying Special Effects    Geom = GeomFactory.Instance.CreateCircleGeom physicsSimulator,                                                 Body, Radius, 6 ;   Geom.FrictionCoefficient = 0.2f;      Add a collision event handler   Geom.OnCollision += OnCollision; }  8.	 Override the LoadContent method to load the meteor's mesh, set its initial    position and assign it to the Body instance:: public override void LoadContent   {   base.LoadContent  ;   _mesh = _game.ContentManager.Load  "meteor.ase" ;   _scene.AddNode _mesh ;   _mesh.Position.X = 0;   _mesh.Position.Y = 0;   _mesh.Position.Z = 0;   Body.Position = new Vector2 _mesh.Position.X, _mesh.Position.Y ; }  9.	 Override the Update method to update the meteor's position copying the values    for the associated Body's position and to rotate it: public override void Update   {   base.Update  ;   _mesh.Position.X = Body.Position.X;   _mesh.Position.Y = Body.Position.Y;   _mesh.World = Balder.Core.Math.Matrix.CreateRotationY                 FarseerGames.FarseerPhysics.Mathematics.MathHelper.

Add the following public method to change the position for both the mesh in the  3D world and the 2D body representing the circle for the meteor in the 2D physics   engine world: public void SetPosition float x, float y, float z  {   _mesh.Position.X = x;   _mesh.Position.Y = y;   _mesh.Position.Z = z;   Body.Position = new Vector2 x, y ; }  [ 310 ]   Chapter 11  11.	 Add the following private method to accept collisions between meteors:  private bool OnCollision Geom geom1, Geom geom2, ContactList                                                        contactList  {      We're just working with meteors   return true; }  What just happened? Now, we have a subclass of Actor that loads the meteor's model and updates its position  according to an associated physics simulator.  This class is very similar to the Ufo class. However, in this case, we are working with a  circular body and a circular geometry.  We created the body associated with the 3D model using the CreateCircleBody function,  as shown in the following line:  Body = BodyFactory.Instance.CreateCircleBody physicsSimulator,                                                          Radius, Mass ; As we want the meteor to rotate forever, we assigned a 0 to the associated body's rotational  drag coefficient:  Body.RotationalDragCoefficient = 0f;  Time for action – creating and controlling a meteor rain Now, we are going to add another physics simulator with a different gravitational force to  control dozens of meteors and to create the illusion of a meteors rain.  1.	 Stay in the 3DInvadersSilverlight project,. 2.	 Open InvadersGame.cs.cs for the C code. 3.	 Add the following private variable in the public class InvadersGame :  RealTimeGame, to hold another PhysicsSimulator  FarseerGames.

Add the following private variables to hold the list of meteors, the number of    meteors to create and a random number generator: protected List  _meteors;    A random generator protected Random _random = new Random  ;    The number of meteors to create private int _meteorsNumber = 30;  6.	 Add the following private method to initialize the meteors physics simulator,   specifying a specific desired gravitational force as a 2D vector parameter: private void InitializeMeteorsPhysicsSimulator   {   _meteorsPhysicsSimulator = new PhysicsSimulator new                                            Vector2 0.15f, 0.35f  ;     50 pixels = 1 meter   ConvertUnits.SetDisplayUnitToSimUnitRatio 50 ; }  7.	 Add the following private method to create and add a certain number of   Meteor instances to a list and to add these new actors to the scene: private void AddMeteors   {   _meteors = new List  _meteorsNumber ;   for  int i = 0; i < _meteorsNumber; i++    {     Meteor meteor = new Meteor this, Scene,                                 _meteorsPhysicsSimulator ;     _meteors.Add meteor ;     AddActor meteor ;   } }  8.

Add the following line of code before the end of the UpdateWithTime method:  _meteorsPhysicsSimulator.Update  float _elapsedTime.TotalSeconds ;  10.	 Add the following private method to define initial random locations for each   meteor in the list and to apply a torque to let them roll forever while they move: private void SetMeteorsPositions   {   for  int i = 0; i < _meteorsNumber; i++   [ 312 ]   Chapter 11       {     _meteors[i].SetPosition _random.Next -20, 10 , _random.Next -     20, 10 , _random.Next -20, 30  ;     _meteors[i].Body.ApplyTorque 1.5f ;     } }           11.	 Add the following lines of code before the end of the overridden Loaded method    to set the initial positions and torques for the meteors: SetMeteorsPositions  ;  12.	 Build and run the solution. Click on the Start the game! button and the UFOs will   begin their chase game while 30 meteors rain. The models representing the meteors  will fall and rotate according to the gravitational force specified in the new physics  simulator and the torque applied to them, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 313 ]   Applying Special Effects  13.	 Click on the web browser's viewport to activate its focus. Move the mouse left and   right. You will see the entire scene, including the raining meteors, rotating as the  mouse is moved. Use the cursor keys to control the camera. Remember that you  can also use your gamepad to control the camera. While rotating the camera, the  meteors and the UFOs will go on moving, as shown in the following screenshot:  What just happened? You could add an exciting background to the game. Now, there are meteors raining in the 3D  world. Your project manager is astonished with your work.  Using another instance of the 2D physics engine, you could simulate real-life physics for 30  meteors. Now, the game has an attractive 3D background that offers a realistic rain effect.  Advantages of using multiple physics engines We added a new physics simulator instance to control the 30 meteors' positions and  rotations. This way, we could use a different gravitational force than the one applied to the  UFOs. In this case, we used a gravitational force that attracts the bodies to positive X and Y  values  X = 0.15 and Y = 035 :  _meteorsPhysicsSimulator = new PhysicsSimulator new Vector2 0.15f,                                                               0.35f  ;  [ 314 ]   Chapter 11  We were not interested in collision detections between the meteors and the  UFOs. Thus, we could use two independent physics simulators without problems.  The AddMeteors method creates the number of Meteor instances defined in the  _meteorsNumber private variable and adds them to the _meteors list. We already  explained the importance of lists in the control of multiple models during the game. Besides,  it adds the Meteor as a new actor for the scene using the AddActor method:  for  int i = 0; i < _meteorsNumber; i++  {   Meteor meteor = new Meteor this, Scene, _meteorsPhysicsSimulator ;   _meteors.Add meteor ;   AddActor meteor ; }  The new independent physics simulator  _meteorsPhysicsSimulator  is going to take  control of these actors during the updates. The following line is necessary to update this  independent engine in the UpdateWithTime method:  _meteorsPhysicsSimulator.Update  float _elapsedTime.TotalSeconds ;  The SetMeteorsPosition method defines the initial positions for the meteors using a  random number generator with boundaries. This way, we introduced random backgrounds.  Each time the player runs the game, the background will be slightly different.  Time for action – simulating fluids with movement Your project manager is amazed with the shower of dozens of meteors in the background.  However, he wants to add a more realistic background.  He shows you a water simulation sample using Farseer Physics Engine. He wants you to   use the wave simulation capabilities offered by this powerful physics simulator to create   an asteroids belt.  [ 315 ]   Applying Special Effects  First, we are going to create a new class to define a fluid model capable of setting the initial  parameters and updating a wave controller provided by the physics simulator.  We will use Farseer Physics Engine's wave controller to add real-time fluids with Farseer Physics Engine's wave controller to add real-time fluids with  movement for our games. The following code is based on the Silverlight water  sample offered with the physics simulator. However, in this case, we are not  interested in collision detection capabilities because we are going to create an  asteroid belt in the background.  1.

Add the Initialize method to create and configure the WaveController   instance using the PhysicsSimulator instance received as a parameter: public void Initialize PhysicsSimulator physicsSimulator  {      The wave controller controls how the waves move      It defines how big and how fast is the wave  [ 316 ]   Chapter 11       It is represented as set of points equally spaced        horizontally along the width of the wave.

Add the Update method to update the wave controller and   update the points that draw the waves shapes: public void Update TimeSpan elapsedTime  {   WaveController.Update  float  elapsedTime.TotalSeconds ; }  What just happened? We now have a FluidModel class that creates, configures, and updates a WaveController  instance according to an associated physics simulator. As we are going to work with different  gravitational forces, we are going to use another independent physics simulator to work with  the FluidModel instance in our game.  Simulating waves The wave controller offers many parameters to represent a set of points equally spaced  horizontally along the width of one or many waves. The waves can be:        Big or small Fast or slow Tall or short  [ 317 ]   Applying Special Effects  The wave controller's parameters allow us to determine the number of vertices that make   up the surface of the wave assigning a value to its NodeCount property. In this case, we   are going to create waves with 40 nodes and each point is going to be represented by   an asteroid:  WaveController.NodeCount = 40;  The Initialize method defines the position, width, height and other parameters for the  wave controller. We have to convert our position values to the simulator values. Thus, we use  the ConvertUnits.ToSimUnits method. For example, this line defines the 2D Vector for  the wave's upper left corner  X = -20 and Y = 5 :  WaveController.Position = ConvertUnits.ToSimUnits -20, 5 ;  The best way to understand each parameter is changing its values and running  the example using these new values. Using a wave controller we can create  amazing fluids with movement.  Time for action – creating a subclass for a complex  asteroid belt Now, we are going to create a specialized subclass of Actor  Balder.Core.Runtime. Actor  to load, create an update a fluid with waves. This class will enable us to encapsulate  an independent asteroid belt and add it to the game. In this case, it is a 3D character  composed of many models  many instances of Mesh .  1.	 Stay in the 3DInvadersSilverlight project. 2.

Add the following private variables to hold the associated FluidModel instance,   the collection of points that define the wave and the list of meshes  asteroids : private FluidModel _fluidModel; private PointCollection _points; private List  _meshList;  6.	 Add the following constructor with three parameters—the RealTimeGame,   the Scene, and the PhysicsSimulator instances: public FluidWithWaves RealTimeGame game, Scene scene,                        PhysicsSimulator physicsSimulator  {   _game = game;   _scene = scene;   _fluidModel = new FluidModel  ;   _fluidModel.Initialize physicsSimulator ;   int count = _fluidModel.WaveController.NodeCount;   _points = new PointCollection  ;   for  int i = 0; i < count; i++    {     _points.Add new Point ConvertUnits.ToDisplayUnits                      _fluidModel.WaveController.XPosition[i] ,                     ConvertUnits.ToDisplayUnits                      _fluidModel.WaveController.CurrentWave[i]   ;   } }  [ 31 ]   Applying Special Effects  7.	 Override the LoadContent method to load the meteors' meshes and set their    initial positions according to the points that define the wave: public override void LoadContent   {   base.LoadContent  ;   _meshList = new List  _points.Count ;   for  int i = 0; i < _points.Count; i++    {     Mesh mesh = _game.ContentManager.Load  "meteor.ase" ;     _meshList.Add mesh ;     _scene.AddNode mesh ;     mesh.Position.X =  float  _points[i].X;     mesh.Position.Y =  float  _points[i].Y;     mesh.Position.Z = 0;   } }  8.	 Override the Update method to update the fluid model and then change the   meteors' positions taking into account the points that define the wave according   to the elapsed time: public override void Update   {   base.Update  ;      Update the fluid model with the real-time game elapsed time   _fluidModel.Update _game.ElapsedTime ;   _points.Clear  ;   for  int i = 0; i < _fluidModel.WaveController.NodeCount; i++    {     Point p = new Point ConvertUnits.ToDisplayUnits                         _fluidModel.WaveController.XPosition[i] ,                        ConvertUnits.ToDisplayUnits                         _fluidModel.WaveController.CurrentWave[i]                          +ConvertUnits.ToDisplayUnits                          _fluidModel.WaveController.Position.Y  ;     _points.Add p ;   }      Update the positions for the meshes that define the wave's       points    for  int i = 0; i < _points.Count; i++    {     _meshList[i].Position.X =  float _points[i].X;     _meshList[i].Position.Y =  float _points[i].Y;   } }  [ 320 ]   Chapter 11  What just happened? Now, we have a subclass of Actor that loads the models of the meteors and updates their  position according to the fluids with movement simulation. It will load as many meteors as  points used to draw the waves.  Creating subclasses of Actor and overriding its methods, we can encapsulate the  complexities of the physics involved in complex backgrounds like our asteroid belt.  Using an Actor to represent a wave in the background The most appropriate way to represent a 3D background component in Balder is by creating  a new subclass of the Actor class. By doing this, we can keep the main game's code easy to  understand and maintain.  The constructor creates a FluidModel instance and initializes it. It creates  PointCollection  _points  that will hold the 2D position for each point that   composes the wave:  for  int i = 0; i < count; i++  {   _points.Add new Point ConvertUnits.ToDisplayUnits                         _fluidModel.WaveController.XPosition[i] ,                        ConvertUnits.ToDisplayUnits                         _fluidModel.WaveController.CurrentWave[i]   ;   } }  Then, the Update method calls the Update method for the fluid model in order to renew  the positions for the points that define the wave:  _fluidModel.Update _game.ElapsedTime ;  Once the fluid model updates the points, it creates the new collection of points taking into  account the new positions. Then, it is time to update the meshes' locations according to  these points that define the wave:  for  int i = 0; i < _points.Count; i++  {   _meshList[i].Position.X =  float _points[i].X;   _meshList[i].Position.Y =  float _points[i].Y; }  This technique does not offer the best performance. However, in this case, we  are interested in a clear code. We can improve the game's performance later.  [ 321 ]   Applying Special Effects  Time for action – adding an asteroid belt background  to the game Now, we are going to add another physics simulator with a different gravitational force to  control the fluid model as an actor, with a predefined behavior.  1.	 Stay in the 3DInvadersSilverlight project. 2.	 Open InvadersGame.cs.cs. 3.

Add the following line of code before the end of the UpdateWithTime method: _fluidPhysicsSimulator.Update  float _elapsedTime.TotalSeconds ;  8.	 Build and run the solution. Click on the Start the game! button. The UFOs   will begin their chase game while 30 meteors rain. An asteroid belt will  create waves in the background, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 322 ]   Chapter 11  9.	 Click on the web browser's viewport to activate its focus. Move the mouse left  and right. You will see the entire scene, including the asteroid belt, rotating as  the mouse is moved. Use the cursor movement keys to control the camera.  The 3D background will go on moving, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 323 ]   Applying Special Effects  What just happened? You can add an even more exciting background to the game. Now, there is an asteroid belt  creating waves in the 3D scene. You can create any moving fluid model by changing just a  few parameters to define a different behavior for the wave controller.  Using a third instance of the 2D physics engine, you could simulate moving fluid models  for 40 asteroids  actually represented by meteors . Now, the game has 3D waves as a  background offering a realistic effect.  Working with encapsulated physics controllers We added a new physics simulator instance to manage the wave controller. This way, we  could use a gravitational force that was different to the ones applied to the UFOs and   the raining meteors.  Also, we used an Actor subclass to encapsulate the complexities behind the wave effect.  We just added the new actor to the game associated to the new physics simulator and we  followed the necessary steps to update it.  We can change parameters and we can use different backgrounds  according to the game's level or stage.  The FluidWithWaves class creates, loads, and updates the asteroids to follow the wave  that is created and updated by the FluidModel instance.  The FluidModel class creates, configures, and updates a WaveController instance.  The WaveController class works with the associated PhysicsSimulator instance to  define the points that draw a wave according to many parameters, physics properties, and  the elapsed time.  Have a go hero – adding dissolutions, fire, smoke, and explosions The new backgrounds are amazing. However, a great game needs more special effects and  even more advanced physics.  The meteors should become smaller as they fall. Add dissolutions using formulas to calculate  the meteor's erosion. It is not as difficult as it seems to be. You just have to scale down the  meshes. Add a random behavior to this erosion.  Add an explosion when the UFOs collide. It should work as a very big wave. Then, create  additional models to add smoke and fire. Use the wave controller to add amazing effects   to the collision.   [ 324 ]   Chapter 11  Pop quiz – working with special effects  1.  A single game can use:  a.

Specifically,  we were able to add characters raining in the background with an independent behavior.  We used physics controller to emulate fluids with movement and we were able to work  with different gravitational forces. We created 3D backgrounds with many layers. We also  understood the importance of encapsulating complex physics using many classes.  Now that we've learned to apply special effects, we're ready to control statistics and scoring,  which is the topic of the next chapter.  [ 325 ]    12  Controlling Statistics and Scoring  A game must provide information to its players. It has to offer statistics for the  main characters and for the enemies. This information is vital for informing the  players' decisions. On the one hand, if the player has three remaining lives, he  can take risks. On the other hand, if he has just one remaining life, he cannot.  Therefore, we have to use great designs for the gauges that show information  to the player. At the same time, the information must be accurate because the  player is going to take important decisions using it.  In this chapter we will add statistics and scoring to the game. By reading it and following the  exercises we will learn to:              Use special fonts to display information Learn to create different kinds of gauges to display information Work with multiple gauges in 3D scenes Learn to encapsulate complex gauges using classes Update multiple gauges in a game Control the layout for the gauges  Showing gauges and scorecards  So far, we have added special effects, fluids with movement, real-life backgrounds, and  advanced physics to our 3D games. We created 3D backgrounds with many layers and we  were able to add random situations. However, we need to provide some information about  the game in the scene. Players always want to know the score, their remaining lives, the  potential bonus, the lap number, and so on. They want some feedback about their situation  in the game. How can we add nice gauges capable of providing information as text and  graphics to the players?   Controlling Statistics and Scoring  We can do this by combining everything that we have learnt so far with some new  techniques. We have to create attractive gauges, and we have to show them in the   3D viewports. We have to add information about the game to the scenes.  Time for action – using special fonts Your project manager wants you to add the following four gauges showing statistics about  one of the UFOs in the pursuit game:          A score counter A bonus counter A remaining lives gauge A fuel gauge  He wants you to display them aligned as shown in the following screenshot:  However, he does not like the standard fonts provided by Windows. He wants you to use a  special font. You have to work with the 3D digital artists to find the most appropriate font   for the gauges.  [ 32 ]   Now, we are going to download an attractive free font file and embed it into the project  using Expression Blend:  1.	 Download an attractive font to use in the gauges' labels. You can download free   fonts from http:  www.fontfreak.com. We are going to use the 3t font,  downloaded from http:  www.fontfreak.com charactermaps no 3T.htm.   Its website preview is shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 12  The 3t font was created by 2TheLeft typefaces  http:  www.fontfreak. com authors 2theleft.htm . It does not offer the complete Unicode  character set. It just provides 67 out of 128 Basic Latin characters and 4 out   of 128 Latin-1 Supplement characters. However, we are going to use the font   to display a few words in English, and some numbers. Thus, we do not need full  Unicode support.  2.

Now, you can dazzle the players  using a score label like the one shown in the following picture:  [ 331 ]   Controlling Statistics and Scoring  Embedding fonts in the project The 3t font is great for the game. However, as our game is a Silverlight application, there  is not going to be an installation program for it. Hence, we cannot install the font in the  player's operating system. The players will access the game using their web browser with the  appropriate Silverlight plug-in installed. Therefore, if we do not use a standard font available  in any Windows version, we have to embed the additional font in the project. This way, we  will be sure that all the players will be able to see the text with the desired font.  First, we installed the font in our development operating system. Then, we used Expression  Blend's Font Manager to choose the font to embed in the project. We selected specific  subsets because we are not going to use all the font's characters. This way, we do not   include unnecessary characters in the embedded resource.  We can use any compatible font in our Silverlight applications embedding their  necessary character subsets. For this reason, we do not have to be limited  to the standard fonts included in most Windows versions. Nevertheless, it  is always convenient to embed limited character subsets, to avoid creating  Silverlight applications  the XAP output file  with a huge size.

Make the necessary changes in the gradient's colors to make the text visible while    the background remains attractive, as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 12  What just happened? You created a UserControl to display an attractive score gauge using Expression Blend's  visual design features.  Using Expression Blend to create 2D gauges We used a linear gradient brush to fill the background rectangle and the text blocks. Besides,  we added a drop shadow effect. We can create the same effects writing XAML or C code.  For example, the following XAML lines define the TextBlock displaying SCORE and apply  the desired brush and effects:  <TextBlock x:Name="tbkLabel" Margin="8,0,140,8" Text="SCORE"             TextWrapping="Wrap" FontFamily=". Fonts Fonts.zip3t"            FontSize="48">                                                        The value assigned to the TextBlock's FontFamily property is . Fonts Fonts.zip3t.  The Fonts.zip compressed file is going to include all the embedded fonts once we compile  the project. Thus, this value indicates to the TextBlock to use the 3t embedded font found  in the compressed file Fonts.zip.  [ 335 ]   Controlling Statistics and Scoring  If we open the project in Visual Studio or Visual C, we will not be able to obtain an accurate  preview for the new UserControl, because it uses an embedded font. However, the  UserControl will appear as expected in the application. The following screenshot shows   an inaccurate preview replacing our font with a simple standard font:  The great advantages of working with Expression Blend to create 2D user  controls are the possibilities to obtain accurate previews and to work with  complex effects without having to write XAML code. We work with WYSIWYG   What You See Is What You Get . We can also make changes to the XAML  code as needed.  Time for action – showing a score gauge We combined multiple gradients and effects to create an attractive 2D gauge. Now, we are  going to make the necessary changes to calculate and show a score while running the 3D game:  1.	 Open the project 2.

Now, expand MainPage.xaml in the Solution Explorer and open    MainPage.xaml.cs—the C code for MainPage.xaml.  5.	 Add the following private variable in the public partial class    MainPage : UserControl, to hold a ScoreGauge instance: private ScoreGauge _scoreGauge;  6.	 Add the following public method to update the score shown in the    ScoreGauge instance:: public void SetScore int newScore  {   _scoreGauge.SetScore newScore ; }  7.	 Add the following lines of code before the end of the btnStartGame button's   Click event, to create and add a new ScoreGauge to the main Grid:    Hold the main Grid Grid display = this.LayoutRoot;    Create and add a new ScoreGauge _scoreGauge = new ScoreGauge  ; _scoreGauge.VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Top; _scoreGauge.HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Left; display.Children.Add _scoreGauge ;  8.	 Now, open InvadersGame.cs.cs for the C code. 9.	 Add the following private variables:     The game's main page private MainPage _mainPage;    The score value private double _score;  statistics related to the game: private void InitializeStatistics   {   _score = 0;  [ 337 ]  10.

Add the following lines of code after the line base.Initialize  ; in the   Initialize method  we must hold a reference to the MainPage that initialized  the game : _mainPage =  Application.Current.RootVisual as MainPage ; InitializeStatistics  ;  12.	Now, add the following lines of code before the end of the UpdateWithTime   method: CalculateStatistics  ; ShowStatistics  ;  13.	Build and run the solution. Click on the button. Whilst the UFOs begin their chase   game with the previously added background, the score gauge will be increasing the  number shown once every second, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 33 ]   14.	 Click on the web browser's viewport to activate its focus. Move the mouse to the   left and the right. You will see the entire scene, including the asteroids belt, rotating  as the mouse is moved. However, the 2D score gauge will remain in the same   position, as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 12  What just happened? You combined a 3D scene with a 2D gauge. Now, the game can use attractive gauges to  display information to the player. However, your project manager is very interested in the  fuel gauge. This gauge requires a complex and accurate formula to determine the rate of fuel  consumption according to the UFO's speed and the torque, impulse, and force applied on it.  Calculating, saving, and showing statistics When the player clicks the btnStartGame button, we obtain the main Grid  LayoutRoot   and we save it in the local variable display:  Grid display = this.LayoutRoot;  [ 33 ]   Controlling Statistics and Scoring  Once we have the reference to this Grid, we can add new instances to it that are the   children of the UIElement instance. We create and add a new ScoreGauge, aligned to   the top-left corner:  _scoreGauge = new ScoreGauge  ; _scoreGauge.VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Top; _scoreGauge.HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Left; display.Children.Add _scoreGauge ;  The ScoreGauge class offers a SetScore method to change the value for the TextBlock  responsible of showing the current score  tbkScore .  The MainPage class also offers a method with both the same name and parameter. It calls  the SetScore method for the ScoreGauge instance previously saved in _scoreGauge. The  InvadersGame instance uses this public method to update the score whenever necessary.  Balder.Core.Game superclass does not offer a predefined mechanism to access the page  where the Balder's viewport is created. Therefore, we added a private variable to hold a  reference to the MainPage instance  _mainPage  in the InvadersGame subclass.  We added a simple line to the InvadersGame Initialize method in order to save the  reference to the MainPage instance:  _mainPage =  Application.Current.RootVisual as MainPage ;  This way, we were able to access public methods that produce changes in the MainPage.  Hence, we could update the score gauge by calling the SetScore public method defined   in MainPage:  _mainPage.SetScore  int  _score ;  We defined three methods to structure the mechanism to calculate, save, and show statistics  for the game:        InitializeStatistics: It resets the statistics data for the game  resets the score  to its initial value.  CalculateStatistics: It calculates the new values for the statistics data.   increases or reduces the score . ShowStatistics: It updates the gauges with the new values for the statistics data   calls the SetScore method in the MainPage instance to change the value of the instance to change the value of the  score TextBlock .  The algorithm used to calculate the score is very simple; each elapsed second adds 1 to the  score. Of course, we should improve it before your project manager looks at the code.  [ 340 ]   Chapter 12  Using this technique and methods, we can add many 2D gauges and other  interactive 2D content while Balder renders 3D frames.

Click on the web browser's viewport to activate its focus. Move the mouse left and   right. You will see the entire scene, including the asteroid belt, rotating as the mouse  is moved. However, the four gauges remain, in the same position, as shown in   the following screenshot:  What just happened? You combined a 3D scene with four real-time 2D gauges. Now, the game can display amazing  gauges to show real-time information to the player. Besides, you were also able to use the  same techniques to interact with the player, using the mouse. These gauges are very flexible  UserControl subclasses. Your project manager likes the gauges. However, he is not happy  with the rate of fuel consumption. You will have to work harder on the update logic.  Working with multiple gauges Once we have a UserControl subclass that defines the gauge or the 2D element that   we want to show combined with a Balder game, the steps to interact with them are   the following:  1.  Add a variable in the MainPage to hold an instance of the UserControl subclass. 2.  Add a public method in the MainPage to update the values in this instance, or to   interact with it.  [ 352 ]   Chapter 12  3.  Create and add the new instance of the UserControl subclass in the event that subclass in the event that   initializes the game  the btnStartGame button's Click event . Initialize the values for the statistics once the game is initialized or reset.  4.  5.  Add the code to calculate the new statistics. The game should collect the final   statistics to update the gauges. However, the characters  actors  can also calculate  their own values based on elapsed time, collisions, forces, torques, and so on.  6.  Update the gauges only when necessary.  The game updates the remaining lives gauge only when there is a change in  the _lives variable. Therefore, it uses the _updateLives boolean flag  to determine whether to call the MainPage SetLives method or not.  Have a go hero – adding gauges for multiplayer games The new gauges are amazing. However, they are only displaying information about one UFO.  Two UFOs participate in the simple pursuit game.  Make the necessary changes to display the four gauges for the both UFOs.

Specifically, we were  able to use Expression Blend to embed special fonts and show them in text gauges. We  combined many controls to create complex gauges that display information using graphics.  We were able to update the gauges from the main game class. We also learned how to  create and add many gauges to an existing game, controlling their layout.  Now that we've learnt to control statistics and scoring, we're ready to add environments and  scenarios, which is the topic of the next chapter.  [ 354 ]   13  Adding Environments and Scenarios  A good film has always gone through an accurate editing process. A high  quality game has to have interesting environments and scenarios. It has to  show an appealing introductory screen to motivate the player. A modern game  must offer the player the possibility to configure many parameters. It has to use  stages and skill levels. Therefore, we have to use great designs for the different  2D screens that become part of the entire gaming experience.   In this chapter, we will add skill levels that change the environments and the behaviors.  We will also create dazzling transition effects to organize the different screens that compose  the game. By reading it and following the exercises we will learn to:              Use special libraries to create transition effects Learn to work with user interface elements to design multiple screens for the game Define animations for the transitions Take snapshots to provide a starting point for the effects Work with multiple screens, transitions, and effects, combined with the 3D scenes Define, load, and save flexible configuration data for the game   Adding Environments and Scenarios  Working with levels and stages  So far, we have added statistics and scoring to the game. We created nice gauges to  display information to the player in real-time. However, we need to organize the game. We  have to define dozens of parameters, new behaviors, maps, levels, stages, introductions,  instructions, interactive menus with animations, and setup screens, among other things.  Players want to take control of modern games. They like spending time creating their own  gaming experiences, changing parameters, defining new skill levels and competing against  other players to be in the top of the hall of fame. How can we add new behaviors, stages,  introductory screens, and configuration options without boring the players?  We can do this by combining dazzling transition effects with nice screen designs. We have to  work with bitmaps at a pixel level and organize the screens using a powerful design tool.  Time for action – installing Windows Presentation Foundation  Pixel Shader Effects Library Your project manager wants you to add exciting transitions, taking full advantage of  Silverlight 3 shader effects, also known as pixel shaders. They allow you to modify the  rendered pixels of any user interface element  UI Element  before Silverlight shows them on  the web browser's viewport.  Pixel shaders usually run on the GPU. However, so far, Silverlight 3 does not  use the GPU to render pixel shaders. Therefore, we must watch performance  because we will be using software rendering.  You do not have experience with pixel shaders. Your project manager knows this and he  suggests using a high-level pixel shader effects library, which has been prepared to work  with Silverlight 3. Wait! Do not run away! You won't need to learn complex HLSL  High-Level  Shading Language  sentences. Remember that you have already added a drop shadow effect  to the gauges. This effect also used pixel shaders.  Windows Presentation Foundation Pixel Shader Effects Library  http:  wpffx. codeplex.com   is an easy to use open source library with sample HLSL effects for WPF   and Silverlight 3 applications.   We will use Windows Presentation Foundation Pixel Shader Effects Library to add  transition effects to Silverlight for our games.

Locate the TextBlock on the top center of the container Canvas. 12.	 Click on the button named btnStartGame under Objects and Timeline and drag it to   the Canvas cnvMainScreen. This way, the Canvas will be the new button's   parent  container , as shown in the following picture:  13.	 Make the necessary changes to the gradient's colors to make the text visible   while the background remains attractive, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 362 ]   What just happened? You added a Canvas with a background Brush to contain all the UI Elements that define the  initial screen for the game.   The TextBox and the Button have the same parent, the new Canvas—cnvMainScreen.  This way, we will be able to collapse this Canvas to display the game.  Chapter 13  By collapsing and making visible different Canvas controls containing many  UI elements, we can organize several initialization and configuration screens,  without leaving the original XAML page.

Progress "  ;      Set the old image for the transition effect   transitionEffect.OldImage = oldBrush;      Assign the desired transition effect effect   element.Effect = transitionEffect;   return transitionSB; } private void ApplyTransition   {        Create a WriteableBitmap to represent the current screen   WriteableBitmap currentBitmap = new WriteableBitmap                                                  LayoutRoot, null ;   ImageBrush currentBrush = new ImageBrush  ;    currentBrush.ImageSource = currentBitmap;   BloodTransitionEffect bloodEffect = new BloodTransitionEffect  ;      Create the StoryBoard to handle the transition effect   Storyboard transitionSB = CreateTransition bloodEffect,                               LayoutRoot, TimeSpan.FromSeconds 1 ,                             0, 1, currentBrush ;   transitionSB.Completed += new                             EventHandler transitionSB_Completed ;      Hide the Canvas that contains the UI elements that define the       initial screen   cnvMainScreen.Visibility = Visibility.Collapsed;      Start the StoryBoard   transitionSB.Begin  ; }  7.	 Add the following lines of code to program the event handler that will start the    game once the transition effect has finished its animation: private void transitionSB_Completed object sender, EventArgs e  {        Once the transition has finished, start the game     StartGame  ; }  [ 364 ]   Chapter 13  8.	 Now, add the following lines of code in the btnStartGame button's Click event    you previously left its code empty . This code will start the transition effect: ApplyTransition  ;  9.	 Build and run the solution. The new start-up screen will appear in the default web  browser. Click on the button and a blood effect transition will run before the game   begins, as shown in the following screenshot:  What just happened? The application uses a nice transition effect to switch from the main 2D screen to the game's  3D viewport.  When the player clicks on the button, the code programmed in its event handler does not  start the game anymore. Now, it calls the ApplyTransition method. This procedure  takes a snapshot from the main container  LayoutRoot Grid  and modifies its rendered  pixels using a pixel shader. In order to do so, it uses the WriteableBitmap introduced  in Silverlight 3, a StoryBoard to control an animation, and the classes provided by the  Windows Presentation Foundation Pixel Shader Effects Library.  [ 365 ]   Adding Environments and Scenarios  Rendering a WriteableBitmap and using it as an ImageBrush The ApplyTransition method creates a WriteableBitmap  System.Windows.Media. Imaging.WriteableBitmap  instance, using the same dimensions as the LayoutRoot  Grid and four channels  blue, green, red, and alpha  to define each pixel:  WriteableBitmap currentBitmap = new WriteableBitmap LayoutRoot, null ;  This line takes a snapshot for all the UI elements contained in the LayoutRoot Grid and  saves it in currentBitmap using the aforementioned pixel format.  The WriteableBitmap class allows the creation of a read and write bitmap  buffer that can be used as a bitmap source object.  There is no additional transformation applied in the rendering process. The  WriteableBitmap instance creates a copy of what is seen on the screen.  Once the desired snapshot is saved in the bitmap buffer, it creates an ImageBrush instance   and it uses the previously rendered WriteableBitmap  currentBitmap  as an  ImageSource for this brush  currentBrush  based on a bitmap buffer:  ImageBrush currentBrush = new ImageBrush  ; currentBrush.ImageSource = currentBitmap;  Creating a StoryBoard Once the procedure has created the ImageBrush instance, it is time to begin applying the  desired transition effect to the desired source. The following line creates an instance of the  BloodTransitionEffect  TransitionEffects.BloodTransitionEffect .  BloodTransitionEffect bloodEffect = new BloodTransitionEffect  ;  Then, it creates a StoryBoard instance  transitionSB  calling the   CreateTransition function:  Storyboard transitionSB = CreateTransition bloodEffect, LayoutRoot,                            TimeSpan.FromSeconds 1 , 0, 1,                            currentBrush ;  The third parameter defines the transition effect's duration, expressed in seconds,  TimeSpan.FromSeconds 1 .  [ 366 ]   Chapter 13  A StoryBoard instance allows you to control one or multiple  animations with a timeline. It is very powerful. However, we were not  using StoryBoard instances for our games because we needed more  accurate control over the animations.  When the transition effect's animation ends, the game must start. Thus, the method attaches  an event handler to be triggered when the transitionSB ends:  transitionSB.Completed += new EventHandler transitionSB_Completed ;  The code programmed in the transitionSB_Completed event handler calls   the StartGame method—the code previously programmed on the button's Click   event handler .  Before starting the animation controlled by the transitionSB, the method hides the  Canvas that contains the UI elements defining the initial screen  cnvMainScreen ,  previously added using Expression Blend:  cnvMainScreen.Visibility = Visibility.Collapsed; transitionSB.Begin  ;  However, this code does not make these UI elements disappear immediately. As there is  a snapshot stored in the WriteableBitmap instance and it is used as a bitmap source in  currentBrush, the effect will begin running using the original rendered image of all the UI  elements contained in the parent Canvas  cnvMainScreen .  Working with a StoryBoard to animate an effect The CreateTransition function creates and returns a StoryBoard instance, ready to  begin running the effect.  It creates a new DoubleAnimation instance using the initial and last value of the timeline,  and the duration received as parameters:  DoubleAnimation doubleAnimation = new DoubleAnimation  ; doubleAnimation.Duration        = new Duration duration ; doubleAnimation.From            = from; doubleAnimation.To              = to;  Once the timeline reaches the end of its active period, it will hold the last value   FillBehavior.HoldEnd .  doubleAnimation.FillBehavior = FillBehavior.HoldEnd;  [ 367 ]   Adding Environments and Scenarios  A DoubleAnimation instance allows animation of the value of a  Double property over a specified duration. It uses linear interpolation to  calculate the intermediate values at specific time intervals. In this case, the  ApplyTransition method calls the CreateTransition function to  animate the effect using a Double property from 0 to 1, increasing many times  in 1 second. Once the timeline reaches 1 second, the Double property will hold  the last value  1 .  Then, it is time to create a new StoryBoard instance to handle the transition effect using  the DoubleAnimation that controls the progress value. The transitionSB adds the  previously created doubleAnimation as a child and sets transitionEffect, the effect  received as a parameter, as the target to change its progress:  Storyboard transitionSB = new Storyboard  ; transitionSB.Children.Add doubleAnimation ; Storyboard.SetTarget doubleAnimation, transitionEffect ; Storyboard.SetTargetProperty doubleAnimation, new PropertyPath " Trans itionEffect.Progress "  ;  The current image brush will become the old image  the old brush based on a bitmap  snapshot  for the transition effect.  transitionEffect.OldImage = oldBrush;  Then, the function assigns the desired transition effect received as a parameter  effect    to the Effect property for the UIElement instance  element  also received as   another parameter:  element.Effect = transitionEffect;  The function returns the new StoryBoard instance  transitionSB , ready to begin  running the transition effect.  We can also define effects, storyboards, and animations using XAML code.  Time for action – changing the transition effect Your project manager liked the transition effect. However, he has been watching the demo  application included with the library and he wants you to test other effects. As he is going to  ask you to test dozens of effects, you want to prepare the code to make it simple to change a  transition effect.  [ 36 ]   Chapter 13  Now, we are going to use different transition effects before the game starts:  1.	 Stay in the 3DInvadersSilverlight project. 2.	 Open MainPage.xaml.cs. 3.	 Replace the line that creates the BloodTransitionEffect instance in the   ApplyTransition method with the following one.  We want to apply a swirl   transition effect. : var transitionEffect = new                         TransitionEffects.WaterTransitionEffect  ;  4.	 Replace the line that calls the CreateTransition function in  the previously mentioned method with the following one.  We  want to simplify the process used to change the effect. :  Storyboard transitionSB = CreateTransition transitionEffect,                            LayoutRoot, TimeSpan.FromSeconds 3 ,                            0, 1, currentBrush ;  5.	 Build and run the solution. The new initial screen will appear on the default web   browser. Click on the button and a water effect transition will run before the game  begins, and it will last for three seconds, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 36 ]   Adding Environments and Scenarios  6.	 Now, replace the WaterTransitionEffect class name with   SwirlTransitionEffect in the ApplyTransition method  we want to apply a  swirl transition effect . The line that assigns the transitionEffect variable   will be like this one: var transitionEffect = new                         TransitionEffects.SwirlTransitionEffect  ;  7.	 Build and run the solution again. Click on the button and a swirl effect transition will   run before the game begins, and it will last for three seconds, as shown in the   following screenshot:  What just happened? Now, you can test different transition effects by changing just one word in the code. The 3D  digital artists also want to test different transition effects for the game's diverse stages. You  will have to teach them how to change the effect class and build the solution.  Exploring transition effects We changed two lines of code in order to simplify the replacement of transition effects.  We used the var keyword to instruct the compiler to infer the type of the variable that is  evaluated from the expression on the right side of the effect initialization statement:  var transitionEffect = new TransitionEffects.SwirlTransitionEffect  ;  [ 370 ]   Chapter 13  This way, we do not have to explicitly change the type each time we change the effect.  Thus, we send the new transitionEffect local variable as a parameter to the  CreateTransition function.  We can explore the different transition effects presented by Windows Presentation  Foundation Pixel Shader Effects Library by checking the classes offered by  TransitionEffects and testing them with the sample application. The following table  shows the names for all the transition effects offered in release 2.0:  Transition effect BandedSwirlTransitionEffect BloodTransitionEffect CircleStretchTransitionEffect CloudyTransitionEffect DisolveTransitionEffect FadeTransitionEffect LineRevealTransitionEffect PixelateInTransitionEffect PixelateTransitionEffect RadialWiggleTransitionEffect RandomizedTransitionEffect RotateCrumbleTransitionEffect ShrinkTransitionEffect SmoothSwirlGridTransitionEffect SwirlGridTransitionEffect SwirlTransitionEffect WaterTransitionEffect  Transition effect BlindsTransitionEffect CircleRevealTransitionEffect CircularBlurTransitionEffect CrumbleTransitionEffect DropFadeTransitionEffect LeastBrightTransitionEffect MostBrightTransitionEffect PixelateOutTransitionEffect RadialBlurTransitionEffect RandomCircleRevealTransitionEffect RippleTransitionEffect SaturateTransitionEffect SlideInTransitionEffect  TransitionEffect WaveTransitionEffect  Working with multiple transition effects Once we have a Canvas that groups the UI elements that we want to hide, the steps needed  to apply a transition effect are as following:  1.  Create a new ImageBrush using a WriteableBitmap to hold a snapshot of the   desired initial picture in the transition.  2.  Create a StoryBoard holding a DoubleAnimation, targeting the   TransitionEffect Progress property.  3.  Define the initial picture  OldImage  for the TransitionEffect subclass instance. 4.  Assign the TransitionEffect subclass instance to the Canvas or parent UI   element  Effect .  [ 371 ]   Adding Environments and Scenarios  5.  Attach the event handler to the StoryBoard instance with the actions to be   performed once the transition ends.  6.  Collapse the Canvas or parent's UI visibility. 7.  Start the StoryBoard timeline.  Time for action – using skill levels Your project manager wants you to add four skill levels to the game:          Rookie Beginner Intermediate Advanced  Each skill level has to define different parameters for the game. The player must be able to  select the desired skill level and the game must consider its related parameter values.  Now, we are going to create an XML file to define some values for a few parameters:  1.	 Stay in the 3DInvadersSilverlight project. 2.	 Right-click on 3DInvadersSilverlight  the main project  in the Solution  Explorer and select Add  New item… from the context menu that appears.   A dialog box will then appear.  3.	 Select XML File from the list, enter the name SkillLevels.xml for this new file,   and click on Add. A new item will be added to the 3DInvadersSilverlight  project, named SkillLevels.xml, with the following line of XML code:    4.	 Add the following line to start defining SkillLevels:     5.	 Add the following lines to define the first level—Rookie:       Rookie     10     25     -25     10000     6     100     [ 372 ]   6.	 Add the following lines to define the second level—Beginner.  Chapter 13  7.	 Add the following lines to define the third level—Intermediate.       Beginner     20     20     -20     7000     5     90          Intermediate     24     15     -15     5000     4     70     8.	 Add the following lines to define the fourth level—Advanced.       Advanced     36     10     -10     2000     2     50     9.	 Add the following line to close SkillLevels:     [ 373 ]   Adding Environments and Scenarios  10.	 You will be able to toggle the outlining expansion for these groups, as shown in    the following screenshot:  What just happened? We added an XML file to the project with the definitions of the four skill levels. Now, the  application can access the following parameter values for each skill level:                  levelId title meteorsNumber impulseX impulseY bonus lives fuelLevel  Now, we have everything we need to begin changing the game's behavior according to the  skill level.  [ 374 ]   Chapter 13  Time for action – changing and improving the environments  according to the skill level Now, we have to make some changes to the main game class to configure many behaviors  according to the selected skill level.  1.	 Stay in the project, 3DInvadersSilverlight. 2.	 Click on 3DInvadersSilverlight in the Solution Explorer. 3.	 Select Project  Add Reference… and select System.Xml.Linq. Then, click on OK. 4.	 Open InvadersGame.cs. 5.	 Add the following lines of code at the beginning. We are going to use LINQ     Language-Integrated Query  to XML: using System.Linq; using System.Xml.Linq;  C 3.0  Visual C 2008  introduced LINQ. It is very useful for processing queries  for many different data sources. The features of LINQ and its usage in real- life scenarios are described in-depth in LINQ Quickly  A Practical Guite to  Programming Language Integrated Query with C  by N. Satheesh Kumar,  Packt Publishing.  6.	 Add the following private variables to hold the values for the parameters that    define a specific skill level for the game:    The active skill level id private int _levelId; private int _levelMeteorsNumber; private Vector2 _levelImpulse; private int _levelBonus; private int _levelLives; private int _levelFuelLevel;  7.	 Add the following private method to initialize the values for the parameters   according to the values stored in the previously added XML file, using LINQ to XML: private void InitializeSkillLevel   {      Load the skill levels definitions from an XML file   XDocument docLevels = XDocument.Load "SkillLevels.xml" ;      Query the data and obtain the descendants for the desired       skill level id   var q = from el in docLevels.Descendants "skillLevel"   [ 375 ]   Adding Environments and Scenarios            where  int el.Attribute "levelId"  == _levelId           select el;   var first = q.ElementAt 0 ;   _levelMeteorsNumber =  int first.Element "meteorsNumber" ;   _levelImpulse = new Vector2   float                      int first.Element "impulseX"    100 ,                      float  int first.Element "impulseY"    100  ;   _levelBonus =  int first.Element "bonus" ;   _levelLives =  int first.Element "lives" ;   _levelFuelLevel =  int first.Element "fuelLevel" ; }  8.	 Add the following lines of code after the line base.Initialize  ; in the   Initialize method  we must retrieve the values for a specific skill level and   assign them to the corresponding game's parameters : _levelId = 1; InitializeSkillLevel  ;  9.	 Add the following lines of code at the beginning of the AddMeteors method:  _meteorsNumber = _levelMeteorsNumber;  10.	 Replace the line that applies an impulse to _ufo1.Body with the following,    in the CheckKeyboard method:   _ufo1.Body.ApplyImpulse new Vector2 0.25f, -0.25f  ; _ufo1.Body.ApplyImpulse _levelImpulse ;  11.	 Replace the lines that define the initial values for _bonus and _lives with the    following, in the InitializeStatistics method:   _bonus = 5000;   _lives = 6; _bonus = _levelBonus; _lives = _levelLives;  in the StartNewLife method:   _fuelLevel = 100; _fuelLevel = _levelFuelLevel;  12.	 Replace the line that assigns the initial value for _fuelLevel with the following,    [ 376 ]   13.	 Build and run the solution. Click on the button and the game will begin after   displaying the transition effect. It will show 20 meteors raining in the background,  a bonus of 7,000 points, a fuel level of 90 , and the other parameters defined  for the Beginner level  levelId = 1 , as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 13  14.	 Now, replace _levelId = 1; with _levelId = 3;  we want to start the   game in the Advanced level . As was noted earlier, this is set in the first line of  code after the line base.Initialize  ; in the Initialize method.  [ 377 ]   Adding Environments and Scenarios  15.	 Build and run the solution again. Click on the button and the game will begin after   playing the transition effect. It will show 36 meteors raining in the background,  a bonus of 2,000 points, a fuel level of 50, and the other parameters defined  for the Advanced level  levelId = 3 , as shown in the following sceenshot:  What just happened? The simple pursuit game is capable of adjusting many behaviors according to the skill level.  The complexity increases, the background changes and the scoring rules differ. Now, you can  use XML files to define many aspects of games by applying the same technique.  Retrieving values for parameters using LINQ to XML First, we added the XML file with the definitions for the levels. Then, we added the variables  that hold the specific values for the active skill level's parameters. The private variable  _levelId holds the active level identifier  as a primary key .  The InitializeSkillLevel method loads the skill levels definitions from the  SkillLevels.xml XML file  embedded and compressed in the .xap file :  XDocument docLevels = XDocument.Load "SkillLevels.xml" ;  [ 37 ]   Chapter 13  Then, it uses a LINQ query against docLevels to obtain the descendants for the desired skill  level id, where  int el.Attribute "levelId"  == _levelId. As we are sure that  each level has a unique SkillLevel definition, it holds the first element in the first   local variable:  var first = q.ElementAt 0 ;  Finally, the method assigns the values for the private variables using a level prefix,  typecasting when necessary, as in the following line:  _levelBonus =  int first.Element "bonus" ;  If _levelId = 3, the previous line will assign the value defined in the following XML line,  corresponding to  :   2000   As the code in the game was not taking into account the possibility to use parameters, we  had to assign the values retrieved from the XML file to each part of code that defined a  specific behavior related with those parameters.  XML files and LINQ to XML are very powerful to define even the most  complex maps for games.  Time for action – saving configurations Your project manager likes the possibility to use levels by configuring them using an easy to  understand XML file. Now he wants you to find a way to let a player save his own desired skill  level. The game must use this skill level. However, he does not want you to use a variable,   he wants the values to persist in an isolated storage—without adding security risks for   the player.  Now, we are going to add the possibility to save and retrieve configurations values to and  from an isolated storage in a sandbox.  1.	 Stay in the 3DInvadersSilverlight project. 2.	 Open InvadersGame.cs. 3.	 Add the following lines of code at the beginning  as we are going to use the    IsolatedStorageSettings class :  using System.IO.IsolatedStorage;  [ 37 ]   Adding Environments and Scenarios  4.	 Add the following private variable to access the isolated application settings:  private IsolatedStorageSettings _appSettings =                        IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings;  5.	 Add the following private static variable to define a string that represents    the key to save the desired skill level for the player: private static String ISKeySkillLevel = "skillLevel";  6.	 Add the following private methods to save and load the desired skill level id as    an isolated application settings key: private void SaveDesiredSkillLevel   {   try   {     if  _appSettings.Contains ISKeySkillLevel            The key already exists       _appSettings[ISKeySkillLevel] = _levelId;     else          The key does not exist       _appSettings.Add ISKeySkillLevel, _levelId ;   }   catch  ArgumentException ex    {        Something went wrong   } } private void LoadDesiredSkillLevel   {   try   {     _levelId =  int _appSettings[ISKeySkillLevel];   }   catch  System.Collections.Generic.KeyNotFoundException ex    {        Something went wrong, use a default level     _levelId = 0;   } }  [ 30 ]   What just happened? Now, we have two simple methods to save and load the desired skill level in isolated storage.  We can offer the players the ability to save their favorite initial skill level for the game.  Chapter 13  The isolated storage enables Silverlight applications to create and maintain a  safe client-side virtual file system for partial trust applications. It is useful to save  some persistent configuration data for our applications when necessary.  The SaveDesiredSkillLevel method checks whether the key already exists or not. If it  exists, it updates its value:  _appSettings[ISKeySkillLevel] = _levelId;  If it does not exist, it creates the new key:  _appSettings.Add ISKeySkillLevel, _levelId ;  The LoadDesiredSkillLevel method tries to get the value for the key. If something goes  wrong, it uses a default level id  0 .  In this case, to keep things simple, we did not consider some problems that  might occur while accessing the isolated storage, like space problems and quotas  being exceeded. Therefore, we did not check for specific exceptions. This is not  good practice in critical applications.  Have a go hero – displaying amazing menus with configuration options You have to exploit the transition effects offered by Windows Presentation Foundation Pixel  Shader Effects Library combined with the features offered by Expression Blend to create  amazing user interfaces.  You already know how to add new transitions. You can create many Canvas instances in the  same XAML page, with many UI elements inside each one, and you can display configuration  menus using the powerful pixel shaders behind this easy-to-use library.  Your project manager wants you to add an animated menu to let the user configure all   the parameters for each skill level. The default parameters will be the ones defined in   the original XML file. However, the user can change each parameter to customize the   gaming experience.  [ 31 ]   Adding Environments and Scenarios  Have a go hero – showing stages The transition effects are ideal to show different stages for the game.  Add another transition before the game begins displaying the titles of the different levels    retrieved from the XML definition file  and the legendary READY! message. Remember to  use a Canvas to hold the UI elements and to hide it when the transition begins.  Balder offers a very simple way to stop a game that is running. You can call the Stop   method. Then, you can create transitions taking a snapshot for the parent that displays  Balder's viewport.  Add a transition to a GAME OVER screen when the player has no more lives remaining.  Add a high score management system, using the isolated storage. The initial screen must  offer the player the possibility to check the game's hall of fame  the first top ten high scores .  Pop quiz – avoiding the GAME OVER screen  1.  Pixel shaders allow you to:  a.  Take a snapshot from any UI Element. b.  Modify the rendered pixels of any UI Element before Silverlight shows   them on the web browser viewport.  c.  Apply an effect to the web browser main window's borders.  2.  HLSL stands for:  a.

Embedded in the .asp file c.  Embedded and compressed in the XML.zip file.  [ 32 ]   Chapter 13  4.  The WriteableBitmap class allows:  a.  Creating a HLSL file. b.  Creating a read and write bitmap buffer that can be used as a bitmap   source object.  c.  Creating a buffered isolated storage.  5.  A StoryBoard instance allows:  a.  Controlling one or multiple animations with a timeline. b.  Controlling just one animation with a timeline. c.  Controlling a foreach loop with a WriteableBitmap.  6.  The following line starts the sbTest StoryBoard instance:  a.  sbTest.DoLoop  ; b.  sbTest.Begin  ; c.  sbTest.StartTimeline  ;  Summary  We learned a lot in this chapter about creating dazzling transition effects to organize  different screens for the game. Specifically, we were able to use specialized libraries to apply  pixel shaders without having to learn HLSL. We used Expression Blend to create nice screens  prepared for the transition effects controlled in C. We combined many UI elements to group  them in order to hide or show them as necessary. We were able to define parameters using  XML files and we also understood how to save preferences in an isolated storage.  Now that we've learned to add environments, scenarios, configuration screens, and stages,  we're ready to add sound, music and video, which is the topic of the next chapter.  [ 33 ]    14  Adding Sound, Music, and Video  A game needs sound, music and video. It has to offer the player attractive  background music. It must also generate sounds associated with certain game  events. When a spaceship shoots a laser beam, a sound must accompany  this action. Reproducing videos showing high-quality previously rendered  animations is a good idea during transitions between one stage and the next.   In this chapter we will add sounds, music and videos to the game. By reading this chapter  and following the exercises we will learn how to:           Add background music to the game Generate sounds associated to the game events Take advantage of multiple channel audio Control the reproduction of concurrent sounds Organize the media elements for the game Prepare our media elements for their use in Silverlight applications Take advantage of Silverlight 3 performance enhancements for videos Reproduce videos combined with animated projections   Adding Sound, Music, and Video  Hear the UFOs coming  So far, we have worked with 3D scenes showing 3D models with textures and different  kinds of lights. We took advantage of C object-oriented capabilities and we animated 3D  models and moved the cameras. We have read values from many different input devices  and we added physics, artificial intelligence, amazing effects, gauges, statistics, skill levels,  environments, and stages. However, the game does not use the speakers at all because there  is no background music and there are no in-game sounds. Thus, we have to sort this issue  out. Modern games use videos to dazzle the player before starting each new stage. They use  amazing sound effects and music custom prepared for the game by renowned artists. How  can we add videos, music, and sounds in Silverlight?  We can do this by taking advantage of the powerful multimedia classes offered  by Silverlight 3. However, as a game uses more multimedia resources than  other simpler applications, we must be careful to avoid including unnecessary  resources in the files that must be downloaded before starting the application.  Time for action – installing tools to manipulate videos The 3D digital artists used Blender to create an introductory video showing a high quality  rendered animation for five seconds. They took advantage of Blender's animation creation  features, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 36 ]   Chapter 14  A spaceship flies in a starry universe for a few seconds. Then, the camera navigates through  the stars.  [ 37 ]   Adding Sound, Music, and Video  Your project manager wants you to add this video as an introduction to the game. However,  as the video file is in AVI  Audio Video Interleave  format and Silverlight 3 does not support  this format, you have to convert the video to an appropriate format.  The creation of video animations for a game is very complex and  requires specialist skills. We are going to simplify this process by  using an existing video.  First, we must download and install an additional tool that will help us in converting an  existing video to the most appropriate file formats used in Silverlight 3:  The necessary tools will depend on the applications the digital  artists use to create the videos. However, we will be using some  tools that will work fine with our examples.  1.  Download one of the following files:  Download link  File name  Description  Application's  name Expression  Encoder 2  http:  www. microsoft.com  expression try-it  try-it-v2.aspx  Encoder_Trial_ en.exe  Expression  Encoder 3  http:  www. microsoft.com  expression try-it  Encoder_Trial_ en.exe  2.  Run the installers and follow the steps to complete the installation wizards. 3.	  If you installed Expression Encoder 2, download and install its Service Pack 1.  The download link for it is http:  www.microsoft.com expression try- it try-it-v2.aspxencodersp1 file name—EncoderV2SP1_en.exe. 4.	 Once you have installed one of the versions of Expression Encoder, you will    be able to load and encode many video files in different file formats, as shown in   the following screenshot:  This is a commercial tool,  but the trial offers a free  fully functional version  for 30 days. This tool will  enable us to encode videos  to the appropriate format  to use in Silverlight 3. This is the newest  trial version of the  aforementioned  commercial tool.  [ 3 ]   Chapter 14  What just happened? We installed Expression Encoder. Now we have the necessary tool to convert existing video  clipart to the most appropriate file formats to use in Silverlight 3.  Time for action – preparing a video to use it in Silverlight Now, we are going to use Expression Encoder to convert the video from an AVI format   to an HD 720p Intranet  High Definition, 1280X720 pixels  encoding profile, compatible   with Silverlight 3:  1.  Save or copy the original video file  introduction_HD.avi  in a new folder     C:\Silverlight3D\Invaders3D\Media .  2.	 Start Expression Encoder. 3.	 Select File  New Job. 4.	 Now, select File  Import…. Browse to the folder that holds the video file  C:\ Silverlight3D\Invaders3D\Media  and select the file introduction_ HD.avi to import. Then, click on Open. Expression Encoder will analyze the file for a  few seconds and then, the first frame for the video will appear on the preview area.  [ 3 ]   Adding Sound, Music, and Video  5.  Expand Profile and select HD 720p Intranet from the Video combo box. This step    defines the desired video profile for the encoding process. The Video Profile options   will display the output video's width, height, and aspect ratio, among other   parameter values, as shown in the following screenshot:  6.	 Click on the Output tab, expand Job output and click on the Browse for output    folder button  …  on the right side of the Directory text box. Browse to the folder   that holds the original video file  C:\Silverlight3D\Invaders3D\Media    and click on OK.  7.	 Select File  Encode or click on the Encode button. Expression Blend will    begin the encoding job and will display the overall progress as shown in the   following screenshot:  [ 30 ]   Chapter 14  8.	 After a few seconds  depending on the video length, resolution, and format ,    Expression Blend will show Ready in the Status column.  9.	 Right-click on the item  C:\Silverlight3D\Invaders3D\Media\  introduction_HD.avi  under Media Content and select Open File Location  in the context menu that appears. A new Explorer window will appear  showing the folder with a new sub-folder with the default user name as a  prefix, the date and the time. Enter this sub-folder and move the new video  file  introduction_HD.wmv  to the previously mentioned parent folder. 10.	 Double-click on the new video file  introduction_HD.wmv  and watch  it using your default media player  Windows Media Player or VLC Media  Player, among others . Check whether the video quality, resolution, and  reproduction are as good as expected, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 31 ]   Adding Sound, Music, and Video  What just happened? You used Expression Blend to encode the original AVI video into a WMV  Windows Media  Video  with an HD 720p Intranet encoding profile. Now, the video has a 1280X720 pixels  resolution and it is compatible with Silverlight 3.  In this case, we created a video prepared for an application that runs on the  Intranet because we want to test the game. However, we will have to choose  a different encoding profile according to the Internet bandwidth offered by  the hosting service and the average download speed available for the game's  potential players. The steps to encode the video using a different profile are the  same as the ones used in the previously explained procedure. The only step that  changes is the one in which we select the desired encoding profile.  Video formats supported in Silverlight 3 Silverlight 3 supports the video encodings shown in the following table:  Encoding name None YV12 RGBA WMV1 WMV2 WMV3 WMVA  WMVC1 H.264   ITU-T H.264   ISO MPEG-4 AVC   Description and restrictions Raw video YCrCb 4:2:0  32-bits Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha Windows Media Video 7 Windows Media Video 8 Windows Media Video 9 Windows Media Video Advanced Profile    non-VC-1  Windows Media Video Advanced Profile  VC-1  H.264 and MP43 codecs; base main and high  profiles; only progressive  non-interlaced  content  and only 4:2:0 chroma sub-sampling profiles  Silverlight 3 does not support interlaced video content.  If we want to use a video with an encoding format that does not appear in the previously  shown table, we will have to convert it to one of the supported formats.  [ 32 ]   Chapter 14  Using free applications to convert video formats Expression Encoder is not the only application capable of converting videos to the encoding  profiles supported by Silverlight 3. We can also use many free or open source applications  and several online services to convert videos to any of the previously shown formats.  One example of a free and open source audio and video converter is   MediaCoder  http:  mediacoder.sourceforge.net  .  One example of a free online service to convert audio and video from one format to other  is Media Convert  http:  media-convert.com  . The advantage of online services  dedicated to converting video formats is that they do not require the installation of  additional software. Their trade-off is that we have to upload the original video file and then  download the converted output video file. If the video files are big, we will need a very fast  Internet connection.  If you have to convert too many big files and you do not have a fast Internet  connection, installing a free and open source video converter such as  MediaEncoder is a good choice.  Time for action – reproducing videos Now, we are going to reproduce the video converted to a WMV format with an HD 720p  Intranet encoding profile, before starting the game:  1.  Open the 3DInvadersSilverlight project. 2.	 Open 3DInvadersSilverlightTestPage.aspx  double-click on it in the   Solution Explorer, found under 3DInvadersSilverlight.Web project  and   enable hardware acceleration  GPU acceleration .  3.	 Create a new sub-folder in the ClientBin folder in the   3DInvadersSilverlight.Web project. Rename it to Media.  4.	 Right-click on the previously mentioned folder and select Add  Existing item… from    the context menu that appears.  [ 33 ]   Adding Sound, Music, and Video  5.	 Go to the folder in which you have copied the previously encoded video in the WMV   format  C:\Silverlight3D\Invaders3D\Media . Select the WMV file and click   on Add. This way, the video file will be part of the web project, in the new Media   folder, as shown in the following screenshot:  6.	 Open MainPage.xaml  double-click on it in the Solution Explorer  and insert the  following lines of code before the line that defines the cnvMainScreen Canvas:     <MediaElement x:Name="medIntroduction" Width="1366"                   Height="768" AutoPlay="False"                 CacheMode="BitmapCache" Stretch="UniformToFill"                 Source="Media introduction_HD.wmv"                 MediaEnded="medIntroduction_MediaEnded" >                   7.	 Add the following lines of code to program the event handler for the    MediaElement's MediaEnded event  this code will start the game when   the video finishes : private void medIntroduction_MediaEnded object sender,                                                  RoutedEventArgs e  {   StartGame  ; }             8.	 Add the following private method to play the introductory video:                private void PlayIntroductoryVideo   {      Show the Canvas that contains the MediaElement as a child   cnvVideo.Visibility = Visibility.Visible;      Play the video   medIntroduction.Play  ; }  [ 34 ]   Chapter 14  9.	 Replace the code in the transitionSB_Completed method with the following.     We want to play the introductory video instead of starting the game, once the   transition finishes. :   StartGame  ; PlayIntroductoryVideo  ;       10.	 Build and run the solution. Click on the button and the video will start its   reproduction after the transition effect, as shown in the following screenshot:  What just happened? Now, the application shows an introductory video before starting the game. However,  your project manager wants you to add some kind of 3D effect to the video. Players must  understand that they are going to play a 3D game.  Locating videos in a related web site First, we had to convert the original video to an encoding profile compatible with Silverlight  3. Then, we added it to a new Media sub-folder in the related website ClientBin folder.  This way, we do not embed the large video file in the application's .xap file.  [ 35 ]   Adding Sound, Music, and Video  The .xap file's size determines the time needed to download the Silverlight  application. We are using the application's website to hold the media files. This  way, we avoid generating a huge .xap file and the application downloads the  media files on-demand.  The Source property uses a relative Uri  Media introduction_HD.wmv  because the  root folder for the .xap application is the ClientBin folder and the video is located in  ClientBin Media.  The AutoPlay property was set to False because we did not want the video to begin its  reproduction until the transition ended.  Stretching videos The video file prepared for Silverlight 3 uses a resolution of 1280X720 pixels. However, our  game was prepared for 1366X768 pixels. Therefore, we created added a Canvas  cnvVideo   with a MediaElement instance  medIntroduction  as a child, using XAML code.  We defined the reproduction area to be 1366X768 pixels and we assigned the  UniformToFill value to the Stretch property. Thus, the MediaElement resizes the  original 1280X720 pixels video to fill its dimensions  1366X768 pixels  while preserving the  video's native aspect ratio.  The following diagram shows the results of using the four possible values in the Stretch  property with the same original video:  [ 36 ]   Chapter 14  The following table explains the results of using the previously mentioned values:  Stretch value None Uniform  UniformToFill  Fill  Description The video preserves its original size. The video is resized to fit in the destination  dimensions. The video is resized to fill the destination  dimensions. The video content that does not fit  in the destination rectangle is clipped. The video is resized to fill the destination  dimensions.  Aspect ratio Preserved. Preserved.  Preserved.  Not preserved.  Taking advantage of GPU acceleration to scale videos We configured the web project to start the Silverlight plug-in with hardware acceleration  capabilities. As we are using the UniformToFill value for the Stretch property, assigning  the BitmapCache value to the MediaElement's CacheMode property, Silverlight will try to  perform the resize operation using the GPU.  The GPU acceleration will work only when the MediaElement has to show the  video in a different size. If the value assigned to the Stretch property is None,  the video size will not change and there will be no GPU assistance during the  reproduction process.  First, we made cnvVideo visible and then we started reproducing the video calling  medIntroduction's Play method, in the PlayIntroductoryVideo method.   As we wanted the game to start once the video ended, we programmed the MediaEnded  event handler with the following line:  StartGame  ;  [ 37 ]   Adding Sound, Music, and Video  Time for action – applying projections We want players to understand that they are going to play a 3D game. Hence, we will add a  plane projection to the Canvas that contains the video  the MediaElement instance :  1.  Stay in the 3DInvadersSilverlight project,. 2.	 Open MainPage.xaml and insert the following lines of code after the line that    defines the medIntroduction MediaElement:     <PlaneProjection RotationX="-40" RotationY="15" RotationZ="-6"                     LocalOffsetX="-70" LocalOffsetY="-105"  >             3.	 Build and run the solution. Click on the button and the video will start its   reproduction after the transition effect. However, this time, it will be displayed  projected using a perspective transform, as shown in the following screenshot:  What just happened? Your project manager is amazed! The 3D digital artists are astonished! You could add a   3D perspective to the 2D video in just a few seconds. Now, the introductory video is even  more attractive.  [ 3 ]   We added a PlaneProjection instance to the Canvas  cnvVideo  that contains   the MediaElement  medIntroduction . Then, we assigned the following values to   its properties:  Chapter 14         RotationX: -40 RotationY: 15 RotationZ: -6 LocalOffsetX: -70  LocalOffsetY: -105  The RotationX, RotationY, and RotationZ properties specify the number of degrees to  rotate the Canvas in the space. The LocalOffsetX and LocalOffsetY properties specify  the distance the Canvas is translated along each axis of the Canvas' plane.  We can apply a perspective transform to any UIElement by setting its etting its  Projection property to a PlaneProjection instance. Then, we  can assign the desired values to the PlaneProjection's properties.  PlaneProjection is a subclass of the Projection class. The last one allows you to  describe how to project a 2D object in the 3D space using perspective transforms.  Time for action – animating projections Your project manager wants you to animate the perspective transform applied to the video  while it is being reproduced.  We are going to add a StoryBoard in XAML code to animate the   PlaneProjection instance:  1.  Stay in the project, 3DInvadersSilverlight. 2.	 Open MainPage.xaml and replace the PlaneProjection definition   with the following line  we have to add a name to refer to it : <PlaneProjection x:Name ="proIntroduction" RotationX="-40"                   RotationY="15" RotationZ="-6" LocalOffsetX="-70"                  LocalOffsetY="-105"  >         [ 3 ]   Adding Sound, Music, and Video                      3.	 Add the following lines of code before the end of the definition of the    cnvVideo Canvas:           <DoubleAnimation Storyboard.TargetName="proIntroduction"                      Storyboard.TargetProperty="RotationX"                      From="-40" To="0" Duration="0:0:5"                       AutoReverse="False" RepeatBehavior="1x"  >        4.	 Now, add the following line of code before the end of the   PlayIntroductoryVideo method  to start the animation : introductionSB.Begin  ;  5.  Build and run the solution. Click on the button and the video will start its  reproduction after the transition effect. While the video is being played,  the projection will be animated, as shown in the following diagram:  What just happened? Now, the projection that shows the video is animated while the video is being reproduced.  [ 400 ]   Chapter 14  Working with a StoryBoard in XAML to animate a projection First, we added a name to the existing PlaneProjection  proIntroduction . Then, we  were able to create a new StoryBoard with a DoubleAnimation instance as a child, with  the StoryBoard's TargetName set to proIntroduction and its TargetProperty set to  RotationX. Thus, the DoubleAnimation controls proIntroduction's RotationX value.  The RotationX value will go from -40 to 0 in five seconds—the same time as the   video's duration:  From="-40" To="0" Duration="0:0:5"  The animation will run once  1x  and it won't reverse its behavior:  AutoReverse="False" RepeatBehavior="1x"  We added the StoryBoard inside  . Thus, we were able to start it by  calling its Begin method, in the PlayIntroductionVideo procedure:  introductionSB.Begin  ;  We can define StoryBoard instances and different Animation  System. Windows.Media.Animation  subclasses instances as DoubleAnimation,  using XAML code. This way, we can create amazing animations for many  properties of many other UIElements defined in XAML code.  Time for action – solving navigation problems When the game starts, there is an undesired side effect. The projected video appears in the  right background, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 401 ]   Adding Sound, Music, and Video  This usually happens when working with projections. Now, we are going to solve this   small problem:  1.  Stay in the 3DInvadersSilverlight project. 2.	 Open MainPage.xaml.cs and add the following line before the first one in the    medIntroduction_MediaEnded method: cnvVideo.Visibility = Visibility.Collapsed;    3.	 Build and run the solution. Click on the button and after the video reproduction   and animation, the game will start without the undesired background, as shown   in the following screenshot:  What just happened? Now, once the video finishes its reproduction and associated animation, we have hidden   the Canvas that contains it. Hence, there are no parts of the previous animation visible  when the game starts.  [ 402 ]   Time for action – reproducing music Great games have appealing background music. Now, we are going to search and add  background music to our game:  Chapter 14  As with other digital content, sound and music have a copyright owner and a  license. Hence, we must be very careful when downloading sound and music  for our games. We must read licenses before deploying our games with these  digital contents embedded.  1.  One of the 3D digital artists found a very cool electro music sample for reproduction   as background music. You have to pay to use it. However, you can download a free   demo  Distorted velocity. 1  from http:  www.musicmediatracks.com   music Style Electro . Save the downloaded MP3 file   distorted_velocity._1.mp3  in the previously created media  folder  C:\Silverlight3D\Invaders3D\Media .  You can use any other MP3 sound for this exercise.  The aforementioned MP3 demo is not included in the  accompanying source code.  2.	 Stay in the 3DInvadersSilverlight project. 3.  Right-click on the Media sub-folder in the 3DInvadersSilverlight.Web  project and select Add  Existing item… from the context menu that appears.  4.	 Go to the folder in which you copied the downloaded MP3 file     C:\Silverlight3D\Invaders3D\Media . Select the MP3 file and  click on Add. This way, the audio file will be part of the web project,  in the Media folder, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 403 ]   Adding Sound, Music, and Video  5.	 Now, add the following lines of code at the beginning of the btnStartGame    button's Click event. This code will enable the new background music to   start playing:    Background music MediaElement backgroundMusic = new MediaElement  ; LayoutRoot.Children.Add backgroundMusic ; backgroundMusic.Volume = 0.8; backgroundMusic.Source =                      new Uri "Media distorted_velocity._1.mp3", UriKind.Relative ;    backgroundMusic.Play  ;  6.	 Build and run the solution. Click on the button and turn on your speakers. You will    hear the background music while the transition effect starts.  What just happened? You discovered that the speakers worked! Now, the game has attractive background music.  Leave the speakers on, because your project manager wants more sound effects in the game.  We created a new MediaElement instance  backgroundMusic . However, this time,  we used C to create it, instead of working on XAML code. We had to add the new  MediaElement to a parent container:  LayoutRoot.Children.Add backgroundMusic ;  Then, we defined the desired Volume level and the Source as a new relative Uri  Uniform  Resource Identifier :  backgroundMusic.Volume = 0.8; backgroundMusic.Source = new Uri "Media distorted_velocity._1.mp3",                                                      UriKind.Relative ;  The Volume ranges from 0 to 1. It uses a linear scale. We used 0.8 because we want the  future sound effects to be louder than the background music.  The first parameter for the new Uri is the relative path  ClientBin is our base path   in the web project . The second one is the UriKind. In this case, we are working with a  Relative Uri.  Once we set up all the necessary parameters, we called the Play method and Silverlight  started playing the MP3 file:  backgroundMusic.Play  ;  The code goes on running while the music file is being played. Hence, the game starts and  we can still hear the music.  [ 404 ]   Chapter 14  Time for action – preparing audio files to use them in Silverlight As with video files, Silverlight 3 does not support all audio formats. Now, we are going to use  Expression Encoder to convert audio files video from WAV  WAVeform audio format  format  to a WMA  Windows Media Audio  format with an adaptive streaming audio encoding  profile, compatible with Silverlight 3:  1.  Your project manager found two excellent WAV files to use as sound effects for  the game on The Freesound Project website  http:  www.freesound.org  :  a.  The first one is the Ufo atmosphere. This can be downloaded from    http:  www.freesound.org samplesViewSingle.php?id=235— filename 235__Erratic__ufo_atmosphere.wav  b.  The second one is that of a thunder clap. This can be downloaded from    http:  www.freesound.org samplesViewSingle.php?id=2525— file name 2525__RHumphries__rbh_thunder_03.wav  The Freesound Project website offers high quality sounds with  a Creative Commons License. The website offers thousands of  samples. However, it does not offer songs.  2.	 Save or copy the original audio files  235__Erratic__ufo_  atmosphere.wav and 2525__RHumphries__rbh_thunder_03.wav   in a new folder  C:\Silverlight3D\Invaders3D\Media .  3.	 Start Expression Encoder. 4.	 Select File  New Job. 5.  Now, select File  Import…. Browse to the folder that holds the audio files    C:\Silverlight3D\Invaders3D\Media  and select the files to import,  235__Erratic__ufo_atmosphere.wav and 2525__RHumphries__rbh_ thunder_03.wav. Then, click on Open. Expression Encoder will analyze the  files for a few seconds, and then it will display a Ready Status for both items.  [ 405 ]   Adding Sound, Music, and Video  6.	 Expand Profile and select WMA High Quality Audio from the Audio  combo box. This step defines the desired audio profile for the encoding  process. The expanded Audio options will display the output audio's  codec, mode, bitrate, sample rate, bits per sample, and channels, among  other parameter values, as shown in the following screenshot:  7.	 Click on the Output tab, expand Job output and click on the Browse for output    folder button  …  on the right side of the Directory text box. Browse to the folder   that holds the original audio files  C:\Silverlight3D\Invaders3D\Media    and click on OK.  8.	 Select File  Encode or click on the Encode button. Expression Blend will    begin the encoding job and will display the overall progress as shown in the   following screenshot:  [ 406 ]   Chapter 14  9.	 After a few seconds  depending on the audio files length and format , Expression    Blend will show Ready in the Status columns.  10.	 Right-click on one of the items  235__Erratic__ufo_atmosphere.wma  under  Media Content and select Open File Location in the context menu that appears. A  new Explorer window will appear showing the folder with a new sub-folder with  the default user name as a prefix, the date and the time. Enter in this sub-folder  and move the audio files  235__Erratic__ufo_atmosphere.wma and 2525__ RHumphries__rbh_thunder_03.wma  to the previously mentioned parent folder.  11.	 Double-click on the new audio files and listen to them using your default media    player  Windows Media Player or VLC Media Player, among others . Check   whether audio quality, channels and sampling are as good as expected,   as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 407 ]   Adding Sound, Music, and Video  What just happened? You used Expression Blend to encode the original WAV audio files into WMA with adaptive  streaming audio encoding profiles. Now, the audio files are compatible with Silverlight 3.  In this case, we created audio files that were very high quality because   we want to test the game locally. However, we will have to choose a  different encoding profile according to the Internet bandwidth offered  by the hosting service and the average download speed available for the  game's potential players.  Audio formats supported in Silverlight 3 Silverlight 3 supports the audio encodings shown in the following table:  Encoding name LPCM WMA Standard WMA Professional  MP3 AAC  Description and restrictions Linear 8 or 16-bits Pulse Code Modulation. Windows Media Audio 7, 8, and 9 Standard Windows Media Audio 9 and 10 Professional; Multichannel    5.1 and 7.1 surround  is automatically mixed down to stereo;   it supports neither 24 bit audio nor sampling rates beyond   48 kHz ISO MPEG-1 Layer III ISO Advanced Audio Coding; AAC-LC  Low Complexity   is supported at full fidelity  up to 48 kHz ; HE-AAC  High  Efficiency  will decode only at half fidelity  up to 24 kHz ;  Multichannel  5.1  audio content is not supported  If we want to use an audio file with an encoding that does not appear in the previously  shown table, we will have to convert it to one of the supported formats.  Using free applications to convert audio formats Expression Encoder is not the only application capable of converting audio files to the  encoding profiles supported by Silverlight 3. We can also use many free or open source  applications and several online services to convert audio files to any of the previously   shown formats.  The same applications mentioned for converting video formats are capable of  converting audio files to the encoding profiles supported by Silverlight 3.  [ 40 ]   Chapter 14  Time for action – creating a class to handle audio concurrency Now, your project manager wants you to add different sound effects associated with  different game events. Sometimes, these sounds have to be played concurrently. For  example, a thunder can happen at the same time as the player applies an impulse to an UFO.  It is time to create a simple yet useful sound manager class. It must be able to handle many  concurrent sound banks:  1.  Stay in the 3DInvadersSilverlight project. 2.	 Create a new class—SoundManager. 3.	 Add the following lines of code at the beginning of the class definition     as we are going to use the System.Collections.Generic.List class : using System.Collections.Generic;    4.	 Add the following private and static variables:                   5.	 Add the following private list of media elements that will hold many       The target for the new MediaElement instances  it must be a      Panel subclass  private static Panel _target;    The last sound bank used private int _lastSoundBank = -1;    The number of sound banks available private static int SoundBanks = 5;    The default media folder public static String MediaFolder = "Media ";  MediaElement instances:    The list of media elements private List  _soundBanks;      6.	 Add the following property to control the Volume  it must be improved later with    additional code : public double Volume { get; set; }    7.	 Add the following constructor with a parameter:              public SoundManager Panel target  {   _target = target;   _soundBanks = new List  SoundBanks ;   for  int i = 0; i < SoundBanks; i++    {  [ 40 ]   Adding Sound, Music, and Video      _soundBanks.Add new MediaElement   ;     _target.Children.Add _soundBanks[i] ;   } }  8.	 Add the following public method to play a sound taking advantage of the banks    using a round robin algorithm: public void Play Uri uri  {   _lastSoundBank++;   if  _lastSoundBank >= SoundBanks    {         A simple round robin algorithm      _lastSoundBank = 0;   }   _soundBanks[_lastSoundBank].Stop  ;   _soundBanks[_lastSoundBank].Source = uri;   _soundBanks[_lastSoundBank].Volume = Volume;   _soundBanks[_lastSoundBank].Play  ; }  9.	 Add the previously encoded audio files  235__Erratic__ufo_atmosphere.wma    and 2525__RHumphries__rbh_thunder_03.wma  to the Media folder in the   web project.  10.	 Add the following two public methods to reproduce the previously added   audio files without the need to call the generic Play method specifying a Uri: public void PlayAtmosphere   {   Play new Uri MediaFolder + "235__Erratic__ufo_atmosphere.wma",                 UriKind.Relative  ; } public void PlayThunder   {   Play new Uri MediaFolder +                             "2525__RHumphries__rbh_thunder_03.wma",                UriKind.Relative  ; }  What just happened? The code to manage multiple concurrent audio playback is now held in the new  SoundManager class. It uses some static private variables because there will be just  one sound manager for the game. Thus, we will need just one instance of this class.  [ 410 ]                                                     Chapter 14  The class is quite easy to understand. The constructor receives a Panel as a parameter. It  will use it as a container for the multiple MediaElement instances that it is going to create.  The _soundBanks list holds the number of MediaElement instances defined in the static  variable SoundBanks  5 .  Using a round robin algorithm to work with concurrent sounds The Play method is responsible of playing the audio file, which Uri receives as a parameter.  It uses a simple round robin algorithm to assign the available MediaElement instances   sound banks  for each new audio file that has to be played.  Initially, there are 5 sound banks available.  If we call the Play method 7 times, the following sequence will take place:  1.  Play audio file 1 with MediaElement instance 0  _soundBanks[0] . 2.  Play audio file 2 with MediaElement instance 1  _soundBanks[1] . 3.  Play audio file 3 with MediaElement instance 2  _soundBanks[2] . 4.  Play audio file 4 with MediaElement instance 3  _soundBanks[3] . 5.  Play audio file 5 with MediaElement instance 4  _soundBanks[4] . 6.  Play audio file 6 with MediaElement instance 0  _soundBanks[0] . The round   starts again here.  7.  Play audio file 7 with MediaElement instance 1  _soundBanks[1] .  Each time the Play method is called, the value in the _lastSoundBank increases by 1:  _lastSoundBank++;  If the value is equal or greater than the maximum number of sound banks, it is time to start  using the first sound bank available again  a new round :  if  _lastSoundBank >= SoundBanks  {     _lastSoundBank = 0; }  Then, it is time to play the new audio file using the assigned MediaElement instance    sound bank .  This way, we can play many audio files concurrently. We do not have to  worry about MediaElement instances in the game because we can use  the SoundManager instance features.  [ 411 ]   Adding Sound, Music, and Video  Time for action – generating sounds associated to game events Now, it is time to add concurrent sound effects associated to game events.  1.  Stay in the 3DInvadersSilverlight project. 2.	 Open InvadersGame.cs. 3.	 Add the following private variable to hold the SoundManager instance:   4.	 Add the following private method to create and initialize the sound manger    private SoundManager _soundManager;  related to the game: private void InitializeSoundManager   {   _soundManager = new SoundManager _mainPage.LayoutRoot ;   _soundManager.Volume = 1; }            5.	 Add the following lines of code after the line base.Initialize  ; in the    Initialize method: InitializeSoundManager  ;    6.	 Now, add the following lines of code before the end of the   UpdateWithTime method  a random thunder : if  _random.Next 20  == 2    _soundManager.PlayThunder  ;      7.	 Replace the code that checks the Key.I key in the CheckKeyboard method    with these lines: if  KeyboardManager.IsKeyDown Key.I   {   _ufo1.Body.ApplyImpulse _levelImpulse ;      Play a sound when the user applies an impulse to the UFO   _soundManager.PlayAtmosphere  ; }              8.	 Build and run the solution. Click on the button and turn on your speakers again.   You will hear the background music. Then, the game will start. If you wait for a   few seconds, you will hear the sound of many thunder claps. Sometimes, before   a thunder clap finishes, you will hear many others. The music will go on playing   in the background.  [ 412 ]   Chapter 14  9.	 Now, press the I key and you will hear a strange sound like the atmosphere of a    UFO. Another thunder clap will scare you. Press the I key again and you will enjoy   concurrent sound effects.  What just happened? You are promoted from the position of a game developer to that of a senior game developer!  The game has background music and amazing concurrent sound effects thanks to the simple  use of a SoundManager class.  We created and initialized a SoundManager instance  _soundManager . Then, we used its  methods to play a random thunder sound and a UFO atmosphere effect when the player  presses the I key.  Using a sound manager it is very easy to fire sounds when  certain game events occur.  Have a go hero – animating the game over scene Now that you have shown your project manager videos with animated projections, he wants  you to change the Game Over screen.  You have to use a VideoBrush to paint the GAME OVER text with an animated video.  You do not know how to do it. However, you know about brushes, videos, animations, and  timeline management. You can do it with some additional research!  Have a go hero – configuring sounds and music Most games allow the players to configure the desired volume levels for the different sound  effects and the background music.  Your project manager wants you to add a new gauge with a button to the game. When the  player clicks on this button, the game has to pause and a Canvas with a control panel using  different sliders must allow the user to control the volumes for sounds and music.  You will have to make some changes to the SoundManager class to allow the user to change  some properties that define the volume for sounds organized by categories. Also, you have  to change the way you play the background music in the game.  [ 413 ]   Adding Sound, Music, and Video  Pop quiz – working with audio and video in Silverlight 3  1.

Specifically, we were able to use Expression Encoder to convert many different audio and  video formats to the encoding profiles supported by Silverlight. We added animated plane  projections to videos. We created a simple sound manager class capable of reproducing  concurrent sound effects. Also, we learnt how to take advantage of hardware acceleration  when scaling or stretching videos.  We learnt a lot in this book about developing 3D games using Silverlight and many other  exciting applications, engines, libraries, and tools.  Now that we have learned to develop 3D games using Silverlight, we are ready to give life  to 3D models in Rich Internet Applications. We can create amazing 3D scenes and games.  Besides, when Silverlight is not enough, we have the option to switch to the more powerful  XBAP WPF applications.

Microsoft Silverlight is a programmable web browser plug-in that enables the animation, vector graphics, and audio-video playback features that characterize Rich Internet Applications. Silverlight is a great (and growing) RIA platform and games are the next level to exploit in it. But it doesn't offer 3D capabilities out of the box and integrating a 3D engine can involve lot of complex mathematics and matrix algebra. This book will help C# developers to get their fingers on the pulse of 3D in Silverlight. This book uses Balder, an open source 3D engine offering 3D capabilities for Silverlight 3. It leaves out boring matrix algebra and complex 3D mathematics. By the end of the book you will have explored the entire engine, and will be able to design and program your own 3D games with ease! The book begins by introducing you to the fundamental concepts of 2D games and then drives you into the 3D world, using easy-to-follow, step-by-step examples. The book employs amazing graphics and impressive performance, and increasingly adds more features to a 3D game giving you a rich interactive experience. By following the practical examples in this book, you will learn the important concepts, from the creation of the initial models, up to the addition of physics and artificial intelligence. The book helps you to provide realistic behaviors for 3D characters by enveloping models with different textures, using lights to create effects, animating multiple 3D characters using a physics engine (Farseer Physics Engine), and simulating real-life physics. Videos, music, and sounds associated with specific events offer the final touches to the 3D game development learning experience
