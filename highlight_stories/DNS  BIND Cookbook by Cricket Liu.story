Not a great one, mind you, but good enough so that close friends and family don’t much like playing with me.  My sister claims that she doesn’t like to play with me because I always cheated when we played games as kids, but I have no recollection of that.  I have a decent-sized vocabulary, I’m a good speller, and I’ve been doing the New York Times Crossword since I worked at HP and my manager, Lee, taught me the basics, so I now know all kinds of otherwise-useless crossword-puzzle words. But I’m still far from a great player.  A friend of mine, who’s among the brightest people I know, told me about a friend of his who’s a top competitive Scrabble player. He’d never played him before, so he challenged him to a game one day. On his second turn, my friend had six common letters in his rack, UDINTS, plus the blank  which, for those of you uninitiated in the ways of Scrabble, can be used as any letter . He was sure there were plays that would let him bingo—play all seven of his letters and earn a coveted 50 point bonus.  He told his opponent as much, who replied, “Well, let me see!” After looking over the tiles for a moment, he said, “Oh, yeah, there are at least 15 bingos there.” Some- what incredulously, my friend said, “Yeah, right. What are they?” To which his opponent replied, “You could make your blank any of AEFILMQRGNU, and make any of the following across the E:  Making it an “A”: AUDIENTS Making it an “E”: DETINUES Making it an “F”: UNSIFTED Making it an “I”: NUDITIES, DISUNITE, or UNTIDIES Making it an “L”: UNLISTED, INSULTED, or DILUENTS Making it an “M”: MISTUNED Making it a “Q”: SQUINTED Making it an “R”: INTRUDES Making it an “G”: DUNGIEST Making it an “N”: DUNNITES Making it a “U”: UNSUITED  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  xi   Now, this guy wasn’t so quick with anagrams that he came up with all of these on the fly. No, he knew a Scrabble mnemonic device—a recipe, if you will—for remem- bering them all: finding the anagram DUNNITES, he remembered the magic sen- tence “A fire quelling material,” any of whose letters can be added to UDINTS and E to make a bingo. Of course, he did have to come up with the anagrams of each com- bination of letters, which is no mean feat.  Dunnite, ironically, is the name of a high explosive—not exactly the stuff to be smothering the ol’ campfire with.   You’d think that all you’d need to play a wicked game of Scrabble is an outsized vocabulary, but there’s much more to it than that. To become a competitive Scrab- ble player, you need to devote hundreds of hours to memorization: all of the English words you can spell with a “Q” but no “U”; all the two-letter words; all the three-let- ter words.* In my brain, too much valuable space is wasted remembering which country the ccTLD fm belongs to  the Federated States of Micronesia, and I swear I didn’t have to look it up  to commit stuff like that to memory.  Now, many name server administrators have a good grasp of the basics of DNS the- ory and name server configuration—they’re fluent. But to be a complete administra- tor, you also need a set of commonly  and not-so-commonly  used BIND configurations. Then, when the occasion arises, you can bingo and impress the boss. Or go home early. Whichever.  Unlike Scrabble players, you don’t need to hold all this in your head. I often pop open DNS and BIND  O’Reilly & Associates  to check the syntax of some less-com- mon named.conf substatements, so I certainly don’t expect everyone to remember all of the nuances of BIND configuration. And while I think DNS and BIND is a good book for learning about DNS theory and BIND configuration, I must admit it’s somewhat less useful as a reference than as a tutorial. Sometimes you just don’t feel up to slogging through a whole chapter to figure out how to set up classless in-addr. arpa delegation, and you can’t find the answer you’re looking for in the relevant mailing lists—or you’re uncertain of the answer you do find.  This book is designed to “round you out” as a name server administrator by show- ing you just what you can do with BIND and how to do it, from the straightforward  the 10 English words with a “Q” but no “U”  to the intricate  all the bingos you can make with SATINE plus a blank .  This book expressly doesn’t concentrate on DNS theory. For that, I’d  not surpris- ingly  recommend DNS and BIND. Without an understanding of the theory behind DNS, you’re like the Southeast Asian Scrabble players who memorize the spelling— but not the meaning or pronunciation—of tens of thousands of English words: all syntax, no semantics.  * For a fascinating account of the process of becoming a competitive Scrabble player, see Stefan Fatsis’s excel-  lent book, Word Freak.  xii    Preface  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   As in other O’Reilly Cookbooks, the chapters in this book begin with simpler reci- pes and progress toward the more complex. The simpler recipes should be useful to anyone with a basic knowledge of DNS, while the more advanced may come in handy to even seasoned hostmasters. Each recipe starts with an explanation of a problem and a concise solution to that problem, followed by a more detailed expla- nation of the solution and, often, variations. At the end, you’ll find references to other, related recipes and more complete coverage of the topics in DNS and BIND and elsewhere.  Platform and Version This book covers both BIND 8 and 9 name servers. The latest versions of these name servers as of this book’s publication were 8.3.3 and 9.2.1. Thanks to the availability of early snapshots of BIND 9.3.0, I’ve been able to include a few peeks at its features.  When a feature I’ve described is only available in a particular version of BIND, I’ve tried to note that in the recipe. In general, however, I’d recommend running the lat- est released version of BIND 8 or 9.  I run my name servers on FreeBSD  currently the 4.5 release , so many of the exam- ples are drawn from that operating system.  Organization Chapter 1, Getting Started, covers what you need to know to get started with a BIND name server: downloading and compiling BIND, registering a new domain name and configuring a name server. Chapter 2, Zone Data, describes how to create a zone data file and add records to it. Chapter 3, BIND Name Server Configuration, covers configuring BIND 8 and 9 name servers, from setting a name server’s working direc- tory to serving multiple views of a single zone.  Chapter 4, Electronic Mail, describes how to set up email destinations, while Chapter 5, BIND Name Server Operations, covers topics in name server control and management. Chapter 6, Delegation and Registration, describes both how to estab- lish and police delegation from your zone to its subzones, and how to manage the delegation to your zone from its parent.  The last five chapters deal with more specialized topics. Chapter 7, Security, con- tains recipes on securing your name server against various types of attacks. Chapter 8, Interoperability and Upgrading, describes the pitfalls of running multiple versions of BIND name servers or heterogeneous name server environments, and warns of gotchas when upgrading from one version of BIND to another. Chapter 9, Resolvers and Programming, describes both basic resolver configuration and simple resolver programming using Perl’s Net::DNS module. Chapter 10, Logging and Troubleshooting, provides troubleshooting tips. Finally, Chapter 11, IPv6, covers  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  Preface    xiii   IPv6: setting up a name server to respond to IPv6-based queries, and handling the forward- and reverse-mapping of hosts with IPv6 addresses.  Audience This book is intended primarily for system and network administrators who manage zones and one or more BIND name servers. However, the recipes in certain chapters may be of interest to a broader audience:    Postmasters working with DNS may benefit from the recipes in Chapter 4.   Programmers  particularly Perl programmers  may find the recipes in the second  half of Chapter 9 useful for learning how to send DNS queries and updates.  Other Books and Resources Many of the recipes in this book include references to other books and a few web- based resources. Here’s a list of those:  Apache, The Definitive Guide, Peter Laurie and Ben Laurie  O’Reilly & Associates   For coverage of how to configure virtual hosts in Apache.  The BIND 9 Administrator Reference Manual, the Nominum BIND Development Team; the Internet Software Consortium  http:  www.nominum.com resources  documentation Bv9ARM.pdf   Nicknames “the ARM,” this is the standard configuration reference for BIND 9 name servers, invaluable for name server administrators.  DNS and BIND, by Paul Albitz and Cricket Liu  O’Reilly   Textbook-style coverage of the Domain Name System and its BIND implementa- tion, organized to follow the maturation of an administrator.  DNS on Windows 2000, by Matt Larson and Cricket Liu  O’Reilly   A special edition of DNS and BIND that substitutes the Microsoft DNS Server for the BIND name server.  Conventions Used in This Book The following typographic conventions are used in this book:  Used for filenames, directories, domain names, variables, and URLs.

Constant Width Italic  Used to indicate replaceables in examples.  xiv    Preface  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   This book uses one terminological convention that merits special note. There are many BIND configuration substatements that you can use within several different statements. For example, you can specify allow-transfer within a zone statement, within an options statement, and within a view statement. When I’m referring only to the first use, I call it the allow-transfer zone substatement. When referring to any of the three, I just call it the allow-transfer substatement. While I’m not sure this con- vention is common, it seemed like a natural, compact way of expressing the idea.

I’d also like to thank the Inter- net Software Consortium and Nominum, for their hard work on the development of BIND 8 and 9, without which I imagine my career would have veered in a wildly dif- ferent direction.  While I’m up on this podium, let me acknowledge the unsung heroes of the BIND Users and BIND 9 Users mailing lists, who do a tremendous job of answering dozens of DNS and BIND questions each week—some of them for the nth time. I hope this book helps alleviate their workload a little. Who knows? Maybe we’ll be able to use it  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Preface    xv   like the longtime regulars in the bar, telling each other jokes by calling out each joke’s number: “How do I point my domain name at a particular URL?” “Recipe 2.6!”*  I’m grateful to my friend Paul Phillips, for the use of his Scrabble anecdote, and for his occasional—but always entertaining—dispatches from the world of professional poker. And I am, as ever, indebted to my friend Paul Albitz, under whose wing I got my start, and who sets a sterling example as a patient teacher, selfless coauthor and methodical engineer.  The folks at O’Reilly, as always, have been wonderful to work with, especially my editor, Mike Loukides.  Finally, my love and thanks to my family: to my mom, my first reviewer, whose voice you undoubtedly hear in my writing; to my dad, for hours of academic tutelage; to my sister  “You shut up!”  for her good humor; and of course to my wife, Paige, and son, Walt, and my dogs, Dakota and Annie, for their love and for lost hours.  * For a variation on this joke, see http:  www.awpi.com Combs Shaggy 929.html.  xvi    Preface  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

You try to score high without opening up a premium square, particularly a Triple Word Score, for your opponent.  Most DNS setups start in very similar ways, too: you register a new domain and maybe a reverse-mapping domain; choose a version of BIND; download the BIND source code, if you need to, and build it; configure a primary master and slave name server; and make sure both name servers start at boot time.  This chapter will guide you through those opening moves and help you get your DNS infrastructure established.  1.1  Finding More Information About DNS and BIND  Problem You can’t find information you need about the Domain Name System or BIND in this book.  Solution For much more complete coverage of DNS theory and a step-by-step approach to set- ting up BIND name servers, pick up a copy of DNS and BIND, this book’s close cousin.  For BIND configuration or operational problems, search the archives of one of the newsgroups or mailing lists on BIND:  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  1     For BIND 4 or 8, Google’s archive of the newsgroup comp.protocols.dns.bind, at  http:  groups.google.com groups?as_ugroup=comp.protocols.dns.bind&hl=en.    The archive of bind-users, the mailing list equivalent of comp.protocols.dns.bind,  at http:  marc.theaimsgroup.com ?l=bind-users.    And for BIND 9, the archive of the bind9-users mailing list is located at http:    marc.theaimsgroup.com ?l=bind-users.  For information on the Domain Name System, you should look for relevant RFCs at http:  www.rfc-editor.org rfcsearch.html or you can search Google’s archive of the newsgroup comp.protocols.std.dns, which is located at http:  groups.google.com  groups?as_ugroup=comp.protocols.dns.std&hl=en. You might also check the BIND section of the Internet Software Consortium’s web site, at http:  www.isc.org  products bind .  Discussion This list is far from comprehensive; there’s lots of information about DNS and BIND available on the Internet. If you don’t find what you’re looking for at one of the places mentioned here, use a good search engine to track down what you’re looking for.  See Also “Handy Mailing Lists and Usenet Newsgroups” in Chapter 3 of DNS and BIND.  1.2  Asking Questions You Can’t Find Answers To  Problem You have a pressing question about DNS or BIND and can’t find the answer in this book.  Solution Check one of the relevant mailing lists or newsgroups:    The BIND Users mailing list, at bind-users@isc.org, discusses the operation and configuration of BIND name servers and resolvers. BIND Users is bidirectionally gatewayed to the Usenet newsgroup comp.protocols.dns.bind.    The BIND 9 Users mailing list, at bind9-users@isc.org, discusses the operation  and configuration of BIND 9 name servers.

If everyone did this, the vol- ume of messages on the mailing lists would drop precipitously, and newbies would get fewer curt or exasperated answers from cranky old-timers like me.  And we’d all live happily ever after.   You may want to subscribe to one of the mailing lists or the newsgroup above, rather than just posing your question, getting an answer and disappearing until the next question pops into your head. Subscribing guarantees that you’ll see any replies  since some folks won’t copy you on responses  and will expose you to a wealth of DNS and BIND knowledge.  To subscribe to BIND Users or BIND 9 Users, send a message with the word “sub- scribe” in the body to bind-users-request@isc.org or bind9-users-request@isc.org, as appropriate.

Solution See http:  www.norid.no domreg.html for an alphabetical list of top-level domains. See http:  www.norid.no domreg-alpha.html for a list of top-level domains alphabet- ized by country name  instead of the top-level domain label . Each list includes links to the registration authority for each TLD.  Discussion The most recent edition of DNS and BIND, as of this writing, also contains a list of top-level domains as its Appendix A. However, that list does not include the new generic top-level domains  e.g., biz and info , as they were introduced after that edi- tion’s publication.

Solution Use the whois service offered by the appropriate registration authority, or use a com- mand-line version of whois to look up registration information about the domain name you’re interested in.  The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, or IANA, maintains a list of country-code top-level domains  ccTLDs  at http:  www.iana.org cctld cctld-whois.htm, which includes links to the web pages of those ccTLDs registration authorities. Many of these web pages offer online whois lookups. The web site http:  www.allwhois.com  also includes links to many whois lookup facilities.  If your host’s operating system includes a command-line whois client, you can use that to look up to look up registration information about the domain name. Newer whois clients automatically determine which whois server to query, so you can sim- ply run:  $ whois domain-name  Older whois clients may require you to specify the whois server to use. For these, you can try tld.whois-servers.net. For example:  $ whois –h ca.whois-servers.net risq.ca  The whois output usually contains information about the registrant  the person or organization that registered the domain name . For example:  $ whois isc.org  produces output that includes:  Registrant: Internet Software Consortium  ISC2-DOM     950 Charter Street    Redwood City, CA 94062    US  4    Chapter 1: Getting Started  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

For example:  $ dig ns domain-name  If the domain name has NS records, it’s very likely registered. On the other hand, if a domain name lacks NS records, it may still be registered: some TLDs take a day or more to process a new registration and add the corresponding NS records.  See Also “Using whois” in Chapter 3 of DNS and BIND.  1.5  Registering a Domain Name  Problem You want to register a new domain name.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  1.5 Registering a Domain Name    5   Solution First, find out which registrars can register your domain name.* For the generic top- level domains, this is easy: there’s a list of registrars accredited by ICANN, the Inter- net Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, at http:  www.icann.org  registrars accredited-list.html. For other domains, start at http:  www.norid.no  domreg.html: each entry is a link to the registry for that particular top-level domain. While the registry may not process registration requests, most registries provide links to their registrars on their web sites.  Next, choose a registrar. The registrars for a single top-level domain may offer differ- ent prices for registration and various associated services, such as hosting your zone on their name servers. For the gTLDs  com, net, and org , the cost of registration is usually between $15 and $35 annually  the wholesale price—which you can’t get, even if you “know someone in the business”—is $6 per year . For other TLDs, the cost varies considerably.  Finally, register your domain name with the registrar. This is almost invariably a web-based process that involves specifying the domain name you want to register: personal information, such as your name, address, phone number and email address, and the domain names of the name servers you’ll use  and possibly their IP addresses . Oh, and some means of allowing the registrar to bill you.  Discussion Choose your registrar wisely, and not solely on the basis of price. Some registrars offer notoriously poor customer service, and transferring to a different registrar is much more difficult than simply making the right decision the first time. Ask for rec- ommendations from friends and colleagues, check newsgroups for sad tales of woe and, hypothetically, laudatory postings. And make sure you can work with the regis- trar the way you want to: using a web-based interface, if that’s what you prefer, or via fax or a toll-free number  that they answer promptly .  See Also Recipes 1.6 and 1.8, for registering name servers and changing registrars; and “Regis- tering Your Zones” in Chapter 3 of DNS and BIND.  * Think of a registrar as a domain name retailer. Their wholesalers are registration authorities, or registries, the organizations that manage the registration data itself. A single registrar may handle registration in many dif- ferent top-level domains.  6    Chapter 1: Getting Started  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   1.6  Registering Name Servers  Problem You want to register a name server so that you can then register a domain name and have the corresponding subdomain delegated to it.  Solution Registering name servers isn’t normally done separately from registering a domain name; as part of the registration process for a domain name, you specify the domain names  and, sometimes, the IP addresses  of the name servers that will serve the cor- responding zone. If the name servers you specify aren’t already registered, the pro- cess will register them. See Recipe 1.5 for more information on that process.  If you find that you really need to register a name server independently of registering a new domain name, check your registrar’s web site to see if they offer such a ser- vice. Network Solutions, for example, lets ISPs register name servers that their cus- tomers can then delegate to at https:  www.netsol.com cgi-bin makechanges itts host.  Discussion Before you try to register name servers, make sure they aren’t already registered. Any name server that has had even one subdomain of a top-level domain delegated to it is registered with that top-level domain’s registry.  Also note that you shouldn’t register a host that’s not a name server, even if your reg- istrar will let you. Some registrars  and their registries  don’t check whether the host you’re registering actually has any subdomains delegated to it. But if you register, say, your web server, you may have a hard time changing that information on short notice, and you may forget that your registry’s name servers are giving out answers about your web server. Then, when you move your web server and change its address in your zone data, you’ll wonder why some people are still trying the web server’s old address.  See Also Recipe 1.5 for registering a domain name.  1.7  Registering a Reverse-Mapping Domain  Problem You want to register the reverse-mapping domain that corresponds to your network.  1.7 Registering a Reverse-Mapping Domain    7  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Solution Start by determining whether your reverse-mapping domain is already registered and, if not, which of its parent domains is registered. If your network is, say, 192.168.0 24, try looking up an SOA record for 0.168.192.in-addr.arpa. If you find an SOA record, then your network’s reverse-mapping domain has been registered. If your network is part of a larger block of networks that your ISP owns, you may find that your ISP has registered it. Contact your ISP and ask them to change the delegation for that domain to your name servers. If you’re not sure which email address to use for your ISP, the SOA record will show you the email address  in the second RDATA field  of a technical contact. You can also use the whois service offered by one of the regional address registries to look up contact information for your network, including phone numbers; see this recipe’s “Discussion” for details.  If you don’t find an SOA record, peel off the domain name’s leading label and a dot and try looking up an SOA record for the result; in this example, you’d look up an SOA record for 168.192.in-addr.arpa. If that turns up an SOA record, use that record’s email address or the associated whois information  again, see the “Discussion”  to find out whom to contact to have your domain delegated. If there’s no SOA record, keep peeling off those labels until you find one. If you get all the way to in-addr.arpa, you may need to contact your regional address registry to register your network and the corresponding reverse-mapping zone with them.  Discussion The three regional address registries are APNIC, which serves Asia and the Pacific, ARIN, which handles the Americas, sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean, and RIPE, which deals with Europe and Saharan Africa. Each registry runs its own whois service, which contains information about all of that registry’s registered networks. Here’s a list of the registries’ whois web pages and the domain names of their whois servers:  APNIC  ARIN  RIPE  The web page is at http:  www.apnic.net apnic-bin whois2.pl; the whois server is at whois.apnic.net  The web page at http:  www.arin.net whois index.html; the whois server is at whois.arin.net  The web page is at http:  www.ripe.net ripencc pub-services db whois whois.html; the whois server is at whois.ripe.net  Unfortunately, life is a little more complicated for those of us with networks that have network masks whose bit-lengths aren’t integer multiples of eight. If you have a net- work that’s smaller than a  24, you’ll have to contact your ISP and ask them to follow the instructions in RFC 2317  described in Recipe 6.3  to delegate control of the  8    Chapter 1: Getting Started  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   reverse-mapping information for your network to you. If you have a network larger than a  24, you’ll end up with more than one reverse-mapping domain for your net- work. For example, if you run 10.0.0 22, you’ll need to have all four of the following domains delegated to you:    0.0.10.in-addr.arpa   1.0.10.in-addr.arpa   2.0.10.in-addr.arpa   3.0.10.in-addr.arpa  Woe unto the poor hostmaster who must set up reverse-mapping for a network like 10.0.0 17!  If the length of your network mask isn’t evenly divisible by eight and you’re trying to determine which of your domain’s parents are registered, start by rounding your net- work’s netmask down to the nearest even multiple of eight and looking up an SOA record for the corresponding network. For example, for 10.0.0 22, round down to 10.0 16 and look up an SOA record for 0.10.in-addr.arpa.  See Also Recipes 6.2 and 6.3, for delegating subdomains of reverse-mapping domains, and Recipe 6.3, for handling networks smaller than a  24.  1.8  Transferring Your Domain Name to Another Registrar  Problem You want to transfer your domain name to another registrar, possibly because they’re cheaper or because they offer better service, or to consolidate all of your domain names with a single registrar.  Solution Each registrar has a different transfer process. That process is usually initiated by the registrar you’re transferring the domain name to, not the registrar you’re transferring the domain name from. Check your registrar’s web site for details.  Nearly all transfer processes will prompt you for the domain name to transfer, infor- mation about the administrative contact  and possibly other contacts , and billing information. The registrar you’re transferring the domain name to will then send a form to the email address of the administrative contact for the domain name. The  1.8 Transferring Your Domain Name to Another Registrar    9  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   administrative contact will probably need to send the form to a particular email address to authorize the transfer and complete the process.  Discussion Make sure the email address of your domain name’s administrative contact is up-to- date before initiating the transfer, or he won’t receive the form the transferring regis- trar sends.  If you’re not sure who the administrative contact is, you can use whois to find out, as described in Recipe 1.4.  If you need to change the administrative con- tact, you’ll have to do that through your current registrar, not the registrar you’re transferring to.  See Also Recipes 1.4 and 1.5, for checking registration and registering a domain.  1.9  Choosing a Version of BIND  Problem You need to choose which version of BIND to build and install.  Solution First, decide whether you’ll compile your own version of BIND or use a version sup- plied by your operating system vendor. If you need to run a version of BIND sup- ported by your vendor, that will limit your choices. Often, the version shipped with your operating system isn’t very recent. See if your vendor offers a patch that will upgrade that version to something more current—preferably at least BIND 8.2.3.  If you’re willing to compile your own version of BIND, all you really need to decide is whether you want to run BIND 8 or BIND 9. For most administrators and most name servers, BIND 9 is a better choice. The latest released version of BIND 9 as of this writ- ing, 9.2.1, supports nearly every feature that the latest version of BIND 8, 8.3.3, supports. Only administrators running extremely busy name servers  those receiving thousands of queries per second  or those that require one of the few features sup- ported only by BIND 8 should consider running it.  Whether you choose to run BIND 8 or BIND 9, use the latest released version. Ear- lier versions inevitably contain bugs fixed in the newer version, and some contain dangerous vulnerabilities. Check the ISC’s BIND Vulnerabilities web page, at http:   www.isc.org products BIND bind-security.html, to make sure the version you’re con- sidering isn’t vulnerable.  10    Chapter 1: Getting Started  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Discussion I have sympathy for administrators compelled by corporate policy to run a vendor- supported version of BIND—I come from a big corporate environment myself. Oth- erwise, I’d issue a blanket recommendation that everyone run the latest released ver- sion of BIND. Just be sure you understand what your vendor’s support includes. Some vendors limit their support of BIND to fixing bugs in the code. If you’re count- ing on their help with configuration issues, you may be out of luck.  See Also The ISC’s BIND Vulnerabilities web page at http:  www.isc.org products BIND  bind-security.html and “Getting BIND” in Chapter 3 of DNS and BIND.  1.10 Finding Out Which Version of BIND  You’re Running  Problem You aren’t sure which version of BIND you’re running, or which version is installed on your host.  Solution Start the name server and look for version information in its syslog output. You don’t even need a named.conf file for named to read:    usr sbin named Feb 25 17:17:33 bigmo named[54307]: starting BIND 9.2.0 Feb 25 17:17:33 bigmo named[54307]: using 1 CPU Feb 25 17:17:33 bigmo named[54307]: loading configuration from ' etc named.conf' Feb 25 17:17:33 bigmo named[54307]: none:0: open:  etc named.conf: file not found Feb 25 17:17:33 bigmo named[54307]: loading configuration: file not found Feb 25 17:17:33 bigmo named[54307]: exiting  due to fatal error   Even though the name server doesn’t start, you can still find the information you need in the output: This name server is running BIND 9.2.0.  Newer BIND name servers will also print their version if you execute them with the –v option:  $  usr sbin named -v BIND 9.2.0  If you go this route, however, make absolutely sure that the binary you’re checking is the one that’s running, and that you haven’t recently upgraded to a new version of BIND without restarting the daemon.  1.10 Finding Out Which Version of BIND You’re Running    11  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Discussion If you don’t find the output you’re looking for in the syslog output, check syslog.conf to make sure that you’re checking the right file: named usually logs to the syslog facil- ity daemon. If the name server is already running, you can send it a query for a TXT record attached to the pseudo-domain name version.bind in the CHAOSNET class:  $ dig version.bind. txt chaos  ;  > DiG 9.2.0  > version.bind. txt chaos ;; global options:  printcmd ;; Got answer: ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 40457 ;; flags: qr aa rd; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0  ;; QUESTION SECTION: ;version.bind.                  CH      TXT  ;; ANSWER SECTION: version.bind.           0       CH      TXT     "9.2.0"  ;; Query time: 2 msec ;; SERVER: 192.168.0.153 192.168.0.1  ;; WHEN: Mon Feb 25 17:23:53 2002 ;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 48  The version appears in after the string “TXT” on the line immediately below the comment “;; ANSWER SECTION:”. Note that it’s easy to change the version returned in the TXT record, so if the name server you’re checking with dig isn’t yours, don’t take the version as gospel.  See Also Instructions on changing the version string a name server returns in Recipe 7.1.  1.11 Getting BIND  Problem You need a copy of BIND to build and install.  Solution BIND’s source code is freely available. The source code for BIND 9.2.1, the latest release of BIND 9 as of this writing, is available via anonymous FTP from ftp.isc.org as  isc bind9 9.2.1 bind-9.2.1.tar.gz. The source code for the latest BIND 8 release, cur- rently 8.3.3, is available from the same host as  isc bind src cur bind-8 bind-src.tar.gz.  12    Chapter 1: Getting Started  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Discussion If you’re concerned about support for your operating system, you may want to check your vendor’s web site to see if there’s a supported patch you can apply to upgrade the version of BIND that came with your operating system to a newer version.  See Also “Getting BIND” in Chapter 3 of DNS and BIND.  1.12 Building and Installing BIND  Problem You need to build and install BIND.  Solution Once you’ve downloaded BIND’s source code, building and installing it is usually easy. First, unpack the distribution. The BIND 9 distribution unpacks into its own subdirectory, named for the release, so you can unpack it with:   cd  usr local src  tar –zxvf  tmp bind-9.2.1.tar.gz [Lots of output]  cd bind-9.2.1  or your source directory  BIND 8 distributions unpack into the current working directory, so you may want to create a subdirectory for the distribution before unpacking:   cd  usr local src  mkdir bind-8.3.3  cd bind-8.3.3  tar –zxvf  tmp bind-src.tar.gz [Lots of output]  Next, make sure that the build will use the appropriate settings for your operating sys- tem. BIND 9 uses the automagical configure program to determine what it needs to know about your operating system and the installation environment. You may still want to specify compilation options, alternate installation directories and the like; to find out what aspects of the build and the installation you can configure, read the README file in the top-level directory of the distribution, or run configure --help. Once you’ve decided, run configure with those options, and once it’s finished, run make:   . configure  make  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  1.12 Building and Installing BIND    13   BIND 8 still uses a Makefile. To change compilation options, find the subdirectory of src port relevant to your operating system—for example, src port freebsd for FreeBSD. Edit the Makefile.set file in that directory as you see fit, then build BIND with:   make clean  make depend  make all   make install  Finally, to install either BIND 8 or BIND 9, run:  You’ll probably need to su to root to install the various binaries and libraries.  Discussion If you have problems building BIND, check the archives of the mailing lists and newsgroups in Recipe 1.1, and any newsgroups specific to your operating system for hints. You might also want to look for BIND in archives of precompiled binaries for your operating system, as described in Recipe 1.13.  See Also Recipe 1.11 for getting the BIND source code and Recipe 1.13 for getting precom- piled copies of BIND, and Appendix C of DNS and BIND.  1.13 Getting a Precompiled Version of BIND  Problem You need a copy of BIND precompiled for your particular operating system.  Solution Search the software archive for your operating system for a precompiled version of BIND. Here are the locations of precompiled versions of BIND for a few popular operating systems:  FreeBSD 4.6  BIND 9.2.1: ftp:  ftp.freebsd.org pub FreeBSD ports i386 packages-5-current net  bind9-9.2.1.tgz Red Hat Linux 7.3 BIND 9.2.0: bind-9.2.0-8.i386.rpm  ftp:  ftp.redhat.com pub redhat linux 7.3 en os i386 RedHat RPMS   14    Chapter 1: Getting Started  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Solaris 8  BIND 9.2.1: http:  www.ibiblio.org pub solaris freeware sparc 8 bind-9.2.1-sol8- sparc-local.gz  Windows 2000 and XP  BIND 9.2.1: ftp:  ftp.isc.org isc bind contrib ntbind-9.2.1 BIND9.2.1.zip  Discussion This option doesn’t allow any customization of compile-time options, like whether BIND is built multithreaded or with IPv6 support, so I’d recommend compiling your own copy of BIND if you can.  See Also Recipes 1.11 and 1.12 for getting a copy of BIND and compiling it yourself.  1.14 Creating a named.conf File  Problem You need to create a named.conf file for a name server.  Solution Use your favorite editor to create the named.conf file, usually in the  etc directory. Nearly every name server’s named.conf file contains an options statement near the beginning specifying the name server’s working directory:  options {     directory " var named"; };  The options statement often contains a good deal more than that, too, including access lists, etc.  After the options statement, add zone statements to configure the name server as authoritative for one or more zones, as described in Recipes 1.15, 1.16, and 1.17. Finally, if you’re running a BIND 8 name server, add a special zone statement for the root hints file, which tells the name server the domain names and addresses of the root name servers:  zone "." {     type hint;     file "named.root"; };  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  1.14 Creating a named.conf File    15   Check whether your installation came with a root hints file, and make sure the file- name in the file substatement matches its name.  “named.root” is just a common name for the root hints file.  If you don’t have a root hints file, see Recipe 2.11 for instructions on downloading one.  Discussion You must specify—and create!—a working directory for the name server because there’s no default. Some operating systems recommend  var named or  etc namedb, but the choice is really yours: just make sure the directory is on a filesystem that is mounted when the name server starts, and that the directory has enough space for your zone data files.  See Also Recipes 1.15 and 1.16 for configuring the name server as primary master or slave for a zone, respectively, Recipe 1.17 for configuring the name server as authoritative for more than one zone, and Recipe 2.11 for updating  or downloading  a root hints file.  1.15 Conﬁguring a Name Server as the Primary  Master for a Zone  Problem You want to configure a name server to be the primary master for a zone.  Solution Add the appropriate zone statement to the name server’s named.conf file.  The zone statement specifies the domain name of the zone and the name of the zone data file, and that this name server is the zone’s primary master  with type master :  zone "foo.example" {     type master;     file "db.foo.example"; };  Discussion Make sure you get the punctuation right: BIND name servers are notoriously unfor- giving of incorrect syntax. Double-quote the domain name of the zone and the name of the zone data file. Enclose the type and file substatements in curly braces, and ter- minate both substatements and the zone statement with semicolons.  16    Chapter 1: Getting Started  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   You must, of course, also create the zone’s data file, which contains all of the resource records in the zone, including the zone’s SOA record and NS records. That’s covered in Recipe 2.1.  Note that this example shows the most basic zone configuration: I didn’t use any zone-specific options, such as an access list for transfers of this zone.  See Also Recipe 2.1, for instruction on creating a zone data file; and“Running a Primary Mas- ter Name Server” in Chapter 4 of DNS and BIND.  1.16 Conﬁguring a Name Server as a Slave  for a Zone  Problem You want to configure a name server to be a slave for a zone.  Solution Add the appropriate zone statement to the name server’s named.conf file.  The zone statement specifies the domain name of the zone, the IP address of the mas- ter name server, the name of the backup zone data file, and that this name server is a slave for the zone  with type slave :  zone "foo.example" {     type slave;     masters { 192.168.0.1; };     file "bak.foo.example"; };  Discussion When configuring a slave zone, there’s no need to create the backup zone data file: The name server will write the backup zone data file after it has transferred the zone from the master name server you designated. The slave name server will transfer the zone each time its check of its master shows that the master’s copy of the zone has a higher serial number than the slave’s copy.  The master name server doesn’t need to be the zone’s primary master. A slave can just as easily transfer a zone from another of the zone’s slaves, as long as that slave gets its zone data from the primary master—directly or indirectly. You can even  1.16 Configuring a Name Server as a Slave for a Zone    17  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   specify that a slave use multiple master name servers: just list their IP addresses in the masters substatement in the order in which you want the slave to use them.  It’s a good idea to distinguish backup zone data files from zone data files for primary master zones; I use the prefix “bak” instead of “db” for backup zone data files. This cue makes it less likely that I’ll try to make changes to a backup  and hence read- only  copy of a zone’s data.  Note that this example shows the most basic zone configuration: I didn’t use any zone-specific options, such as an access list for transfers of this zone.  See Also “Running a Slave Name Server” in Chapter 4 of DNS and BIND.  1.17 Conﬁguring a Name Server as Authoritative  for Multiple Zones  Problem You want to configure a name server to be authoritative  i.e., primary master or slave  for more than one zone.  Solution Add multiple zone statements to the name server’s named.conf file. For example, to make the name server the primary master name server for the foo.example zone and a slave for the bar.example zone, you might use these two zone statements:  zone "foo.example" {     type master;     file "db.foo.example"; };  zone "bar.example" {     type slave;     masters { 192.168.0.1; };     file "bak.bar.example"; };  Discussion A single name server can be authoritative for multiple zones at once. In fact, there are individual name servers on the Internet that are authoritative for over 100,000 zones. Imagine the size of the named.conf file on that name server!  18    Chapter 1: Getting Started  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   The name server’s relationship to the zone is defined on a zone-by-zone basis, in the type substatement. So a name server can be the primary master for some zones while it’s a  slave for others. It can’t be both primary master and slave for the same zone, however.  The order of the zone statements isn’t important. They don’t depend on each other in any way, so you can list them in any order you like.  See Also Recipes 1.15 and 1.16 for the syntax of individual zone statements, and Chapter 4 of DNS and BIND, as usual.  1.18 Starting a Name Server  Problem You want to start a name server.  Solution Run the program named or, if you’re using BIND 8, use ndc:   named  or:   ndc start  Discussion If root’s path doesn’t include the directory in which the named executable is installed  often  usr sbin , you’ll have to specify the full path:    usr sbin named  The pathname of the file ndc executes to start named is compiled-in. If it’s not cor- rect, you can edit the file Makefile.set and set the variable DESTSBIN to the direc- tory in which named actually lives. Then recompile ndc with:   cd bind-distribution-directory src bin ndc  make clean  make ndc  The Makefile.set file you should modify is in the directory src port  , where   indicates the operating system you run  e.g., freebsd .  If you need to start named with command-line arguments, you can specify them on the command-line:   named –c  tmp named.conf  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  1.18 Starting a Name Server    19   Or, if you use ndc, you can specify them after the argument start:   ndc start –c  tmp named.conf  See Also Recipe 3.1 for setting up and using ndc.  1.19 Stopping a Name Server  Problem You want to stop a running name server.  Solution Use ndc  for BIND 8 name servers  or rndc  for BIND 9 name servers :   ndc stop  or:   rndc stop  Discussion ndc stop and rndc stop both tell the running name server to clean up and exit. “Clean- ing up,” in this age of dynamically updated zones, means writing the zone data files of any “dirty” zones to disk.  “Dirty” zones are zones that have been dynamically updated but not yet written to disk.   Should you ever need to stop the name server without saving “dirty” zones to disk, BIND 9 offers the halt command:   rndc halt  If you don’t have ndc or rndc at your disposal  and you won’t be able to use rndc until you’ve set up rndc.conf and a controls statement, as described in Recipe 3.2 , you can still kill named with signals. With BIND 8, use SIGTERM:   kill `cat  var run named.pid`  With BIND 9, you can use SIGTERM or SIGINT:   kill –INT `cat  var run named.pid`  See Also Recipes 3.1 and 3.2 for setting up ndc and rndc, respectively, and “Controlling the Name Server” in Chapter 7 of DNS and BIND.  20    Chapter 1: Getting Started  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   1.20 Starting named at Boot Time  Problem You want named to start at boot time.  Solution On many Unixish operating systems, named will start automatically if the startup scripts see a named.conf file in the right directory, usually  etc. On others, you just need to make minor changes to a startup configuration file. However, on some Unix- ish operating systems, you may need to add the necessary lines to the appropriate file or create a special link to start up named.  On BSD-based systems, named is usually started by one of the startup scripts, such as  etc rc.network. Here’s the relevant part of  etc rc.network in FreeBSD 4.5:  case ${named_enable} in [Yy][Ee][Ss]      echo -n ' named';       ${named_program:-named} ${named_flags}     ;; esac  In this case, the variables named_enable, named_program and named_flags are set in  etc rc.conf:  named_enable="YES" named_flags="-t  etc namedb –u bind"  named_program isn’t set in  etc rc.conf, so it defaults to named in  etc rc.network.  Note that I use the –t and –u options to tell named to call chroot    and to give up root privileges. This requires some special setup; see Recipes 7.7 and 7.8 for details.  If you’re running a BSD-based operating system, named_enable to “YES” and set the other named_* variables, if you need to.  just edit  etc rc.conf, change  On Solaris 8, named is started from  etc init.d inetsvc:  SunOS 5.8   If this machine is configured to be an Internet Domain Name System  DNS   server, run the name daemon.  Start named prior to: route add net host,  to avoid dns gethostbyname timout delay for nameserver during boot.  if [ -f  usr sbin in.named -a -f  etc named.conf ]; then         echo 'starting internet domain name server.'          usr sbin in.named & fi  If you haven’t installed the BIND name server as in.named, you can adjust the  two!  occurrences of in.named in the script appropriately.

All rights reserved.  1.20 Starting named at Boot Time    21   If your operating system uses System V Release 4-style startup scripts, named is usu- ally started by a shell script called named in the  etc rc.d init.d or  etc init.d directory. If you create a link in the directory  etc rc.d rc3.d  called something like S55named  to  etc rc.d init.d named, the rc script will run the named script in init.d and start named when the system enters run level 3:   cd  etc rc.d rc3.d; ln –s .. init.d named S55named  Also, create links called K55named in the directories for runlevels 0, 1, and S, also to .. init.d named, to kill the named process when entering those runlevels.  Discussion The relevant run level is reflected in the name of the directory the script lives in: On most Unixish operating systems, run level 3 is the default. To execute a script when the system enters run level 5  the default run level for most Unixes when running X Windows , create a link from the directory rc5.d.  The “S” in “S55named” tells rc to run the script with the argument start when enter- ing the appropriate run level, while the “K” in “K55named” tells rc to run it with kill as an argument. The “55” tells rc when to run the script: after any scripts with lower numbers, before scripts with higher numbers. If your OS starts other servers that depend on name resolution to work, you may need to adjust the “55” to make sure named starts before they do. But make sure named starts after all of your host’s net- work interfaces are up.  See Also Recipe 1.18, for starting the name server from the command line.  22    Chapter 1: Getting Started  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Chapter 2  CHAPTER 2 Zone Data  Introduction  2.0 With 27 different tiles in an English Scrabble set  “A” through “Z” plus the blanks  and 7 tiles in a rack, you can draw billions of different combinations. And with over 100,000 words in the Official Word List, you can assemble a lot of words from almost any of those combinations.  In DNS, there are fewer than 300 possible types of resource records, and of those, only a handful could be called common. Still, you can do a remarkable variety of interesting things with those records.  All resource records, when written in plain text  as they’d appear in a zone data file , share the following format:  [owner] [TTL] [class]      The fields in square brackets  “[” and “]”  are optional, while the fields between angle brackets  “ ”  are mandatory. Recipe 2.1 explains what happens when you leave out one or more of those fields.  The RDATA field often consists of multiple subfields. The number of subfields required depends upon the type of record. For example, SOA records take seven RDATA subfields, while A and NS records need just one.  A zone data file contains the resource records attached to all of the domain names in a zone. A zone’s primary master name server loads the zone data file, and the zone’s slaves transfer the zone data from the primary master.  2.1  Creating a Zone Data File  Problem You need to create a data file for a zone.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  23   Solution Using your favorite editor, create a file in the primary master name server’s working directory. Name the file after the zone whose resource records it will contain. For example, for the foo.example zone, you might call the zone data file db.foo.example. Begin the file with a $TTL control statement.* This tells other name servers  not those authoritative for the zone  how long they may cache records from this zone by specifying the zone’s default time to live. You can specify the value as an integer number of seconds or as a scaled value: an integer followed by s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours, d for days or w for weeks. For example, you can specify a time to live of one day with either:  $TTL 86400  or:  $TTL 1d  $TTL 1d12h  You can even concatenate two scaled values, like so:  Time to live values between one hour and one day are common. Next, add an SOA record for the zone. The SOA record contains information about the whole zone, including how often the zone’s slave name servers should check to see whether the zone has changed. The SOA record begins with the zone’s domain name, a specification of the zone’s class  which is almost always IN, for Internet , and the type mnemonic SOA. After the type, the SOA record requires seven fields: The MNAME field  Specify the domain name of the zone’s primary master name server.  The RNAME field  The zone’s serial number  Specify an email address at which the administrator of the zone can be reached. Substitute a dot  “.”  for the “@” in the email address.  If you’ll only be changing the zone manually, by editing the zone data file, con- sider using the format YYYYMMDDVV, where YYYY is the year, MM is the numeric month  from 1 to 12 , DD is the date, and VV is a two-digit version number that starts at 00. This will give you a handy indicator of when you last updated the zone. The zone’s refresh value  This specifies how frequently slave name servers for the zone should check their master name server to see whether the zone’s serial number has been incre- mented  indicating that the zone has changed . This value isn’t particularly important if you use the NOTIFY mechanism, which enables your primary  * Assuming you’re running a version of BIND newer than 8.2—and you should be.  24    Chapter 2: Zone Data  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   master name server to tell slaves when the zone changes, but values between one hour and three hours are common.  The zone’s retry value  This specifies how often the zone’s slave name servers should check their master name server after a check of the serial number has failed. As with refresh, this isn’t that important if you use NOTIFY, but values between 15 minutes and 1 hour are common. The zone’s expire value  This specifies how long the zone’s slave name servers will continue responding if they’re unable to reach their master name server to find out the current serial number. Since this determines how long your slaves will answer queries for data in the zone in the event of an outage, you should make it fairly long. Values of several weeks to a month are common. The zone’s negative caching time to live value  This determines how long other name servers can cache negative answers given out by the zone’s authoritative name servers. One such negative answer is NXDOMAIN, which indicates that the domain name the remote name server looked up doesn’t exist in the zone. This value should be fairly low, between 15 minutes and 3 hours.  Here’s a sample SOA record for the foo.example zone:  foo.example.    IN    SOA    ns1.foo.example.                      hostmaster.foo.example.                 2002040700                 1h                 15m                 30d                 1h    Since we ran out of room for the record on the first line, we ended the line with “ ”, which tells the name server to treat all text between the “ ” and a successive “ ” as though it were on a single line.  We could also have just kept typing the whole record on a single line, but that would have been hard to read.   Finally, add NS records listing the domain names of the authoritative name servers for the zone. You probably specified these name servers when you registered your domain name.  foo.example.    IN    NS    ns1.foo.example. foo.example.    IN    NS    ns2.foo.example. foo.example.    IN    NS    ns.isp.net.  Discussion The domain names in the resource records all end in dots to keep the name server from appending the origin to them. The default origin for a zone data file is just the  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  2.1 Creating a Zone Data File    25   domain name of the zone, which in this case is foo.example, so we could have writ- ten the SOA record as:   “@” is short for “the current origin.”  Since these first several resource records in the zone are all attached to the same domain name  foo.example, in our example , you can specify the domain name for just the first of them and begin the rest of the records with whitespace  spaces or tabs :  @    IN    SOA    ns1           hostmaster      2002040700      1h      15m      30d      1h    @    IN    SOA    ns1           hostmaster      2002040700      1h      15m      30d      1h        IN    NS    ns1.foo.example.     IN    NS    ns2.foo.example.     IN    NS    ns.isp.net.  The name server interprets records that begin with whitespace as belonging to the most recently specified domain name.  See Also Recipe 1.14 for creating a named.conf file, Recipe 1.15 for configuring a primary mas- ter name server, and Chapter 4 of DNS and BIND.  2.2  Adding a Host  Problem You need to add a host to DNS.  Solution Add an A and a PTR record for the host to the appropriate zones  which are almost certainly two different zones: a forward-mapping and a reverse-mapping zone . For example, to add a host called host.foo.example with the IP address 10.0.0.1 to DNS, you could add this record to the foo.example zone data file:  host.foo.example.    IN    A    10.0.0.1  26    Chapter 2: Zone Data  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   And you’d add this record to the zone data file for the reverse-mapping zone, which might be 10.in-addr.arpa, 0.10.in-addr.arpa, or 0.0.10.in-addr.arpa, depending on how you break up administration of your reverse-mapping domain:  1.0.0.10.in-addr.arpa.    IN    PTR    host.foo.example.  Discussion You’re free to take advantage of the origin in the file to abbreviate the resource records. For example, if you’re adding the A record to a line in the zone data file in which the origin is foo.example, you can write:  host    IN    A    10.0.0.1  If you’re adding the PTR record on a line in which the origin is 0.0.10.in-addr.arpa, you can write:  1    IN    PTR    host.foo.example.  Since the default class is IN, for Internet, you can leave out the IN, too.  It’s important to add PTR records for your hosts. Without PTR records, your hosts’ addresses won’t map to domain names, so they won’t be able to access services that require reverse mapping, and your network management software may not identify them automatically.  You may also want to add other records for the host. If the host’s domain name might appear on the right side of an email address, add an MX record specifying where mail addressed to the host should be delivered.  See Also Recipe 2.4, for how to add an MX record; Recipe 2.9 to limit how long the records can be cached, Recipe 2.10 to learn how to handle multihomed hosts, and Chapter 4 of DNS and BIND.  2.3  Adding an Alias  Problem You need to create an alias from one domain name to another.  Solution Add a CNAME record to the zone that the alias belongs in. For example, to make a. foo.example an alias for b.bar.example, add this CNAME record to the foo.example zone data file:  a.foo.example.    IN    CNAME    b.bar.example.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  2.3 Adding an Alias    27   Discussion Note that a CNAME record makes the alias equivalent to the target of the alias. Que- ries for any types of record attached to the alias will end up as queries for the same type of record, but attached to the domain name the alias points to. Consequently, you can’t add any other types of records to a domain name that is an alias.  You also shouldn’t use aliases on the right side of other types of records, such as NS and MX records. The consumers of NS and MX records—name servers and mail servers, respectively—don’t expect aliases on the right side and therefore don’t pro- cess them correctly. The only kind of record that allows an alias on the right side is the CNAME record itself: You can point an alias to another alias, as long as the alias chain ends at a non-alias domain name. Make sure the chain isn’t more than eight links long, though, and beware alias loops.  Finally, note that the CNAME record belongs in the zone that contains the domain name of the alias, not the target of the alias.  See Also Recipe 2.6 to learn how to set up virtual web hosts; and Chapter 4 and the “Using CNAME Records” section of Chapter 16 in DNS and BIND.  2.4  Adding a Mail Destination  Problem You need to add a mail destination to DNS.  Solution Add one or more MX records to the zone that contains the domain name of the mail destination. The MX records specify the mail server or servers that accept mail addressed to that mail destination. Each MX record requires a preference value that tells mailers sending mail the order in which to contact the destination’s mail serv- ers. The lower the preference value, the more preferred the mail server.  For example, to tell mailers to send mail addressed to foo.example  such as an email message addressed to hostmaster@foo.example  to mail.foo.example, and smtp.isp.net only if mail.foo.example isn’t up or isn’t accepting connections, add these MX records to the foo.example zone data file:  foo.example.    IN    MX    0 mail.foo.example. foo.example.    IN    MX    10 smtp.isp.net.  28    Chapter 2: Zone Data  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Discussion The preference value is an unsigned, 16-bit number, so between 0 and 65535. The magnitude of the number isn’t important: the preference value doesn’t represent any particular units. What’s important is that the preference values for a domain name’s MX records, taken together, tell a sending mailer the order in which it should use the destination’s mail servers.  Most mailers will spread the load randomly among mail servers listed at the same preference value. This can come in handy with popular mail destinations: You can list a number of mail servers at the most preferred preference value and sending mail- ers will distribute the delivery of your mail among those mail servers.  The mail server must be specified as a single domain name, not an IP address. If you use an IP address on the right side of an MX record, mailers—expecting a domain name there—will try to look up the IP address as a domain name. This causes unnec- essary queries to the root name servers, and fails to return an IP address, anyway.  It’s up to you  or your fellow postmasters  to configure the mail servers to accept mail addressed to the destination. Make sure the most preferred mail exchangers understand that the mail destination is local, and make sure less preferred mail exchangers are configured to relay mail addressed to the destination.  See Also RFC 2821 for authoritative information on SMTP and use of MX records, and Chapter 5 of DNS and BIND.  2.5 Making the Domain Name of Your Zone  Point to Your Web Server  Problem You want the domain name of your zone to point to your web server.  Solution Add an A record to the domain name of your zone pointing to the IP address of your web server:  foo.example.    IN    A    10.0.0.1  2.5 Making the Domain Name of Your Zone Point to Your Web Server    29  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Discussion Adding such an A record lets people specify just http:  foo.example   leaving out the leading “www”  when accessing your web site. Several popular web sites publish their URLs in this form, including CNN.  Many people try to solve this problem by adding a CNAME record to the domain name of the zone, rather than an A record:  foo.example.    IN    CNAME    www.foo.example.  This, however, is illegal because it violates the dictum that an alias have no records other than a CNAME record associated with it.  If you have multiple web servers, you can add multiple A records for the domain name of your zone:  foo.example.    IN    A    10.0.0.1 foo.example.    IN    A    10.0.0.2 foo.example.    IN    A    10.0.0.3  The records are given out in round robin order, by default, as described in Recipe 2.7.  See Also Recipe 2.3 for more information on CNAME records, Recipe 2.6 for pointing a domain name at a particular URL, not just a particular web server, and Recipe 2.7, for a description of round robin.  2.6  Pointing a Domain Name to a Particular URL  Problem You want people who access one of your domain names to reach a particular URL.  Solution Add an A record to the zone to which the domain name belongs, pointing to the IP address of the web server:  mylink.foo.example.    IN    A    10.0.0.1  Then configure the web server to direct browsers requesting http:  mylink.foo.example to the appropriate directory on your web server.  Discussion Most of this solution is configured on the web server using a facility called “virtual hosts.” The web server needs to associate your domain name, when it appears in the  30    Chapter 2: Zone Data  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   HTTP 1.1 “Host” header, with a particular “document root,” a directory in the web server’s document tree.  If the domain name of the web server is in a zone run by someone else, or you already have a domain name in your zone pointing to the address of the web server, you can use a CNAME record instead of an A record:  mylink.foo.example.    IN    CNAME    www.isp.net.  This way, if the IP address of the web server changes, your domain name will con- tinue to point to the right place.  Of course, if someone else runs the web server, you’ll need their cooperation to set up the association between mylink.foo.example and the appropriate directory.  See Also Recipe 2.5 for pointing a domain name at a web server, the Apache Software Foun- dation’s online documents on virtual hosts at http:  httpd.apache.org docs vhosts  name-based.html and http:  httpd.apache.org docs-2.0 vhosts , and “HTTP 1.1 Vir- tual Hosts” in Chapter 3 of Apache: The Definitive Guide.  2.7  Setting Up Round Robin Load Distribution  Problem You want to set up round robin for a domain name.  Solution Just add multiple A records to the domain name. For example:  www.foo.example.    IN    A    10.0.0.1 www.foo.example.    IN    A    10.0.0.2 www.foo.example.    IN    A    10.0.0.3  In successive answers to queries for www.foo.example’s address, the foo.example name servers will rotate the order in which they return the A records, moving the first A record to the end of the list after each response.  Discussion All modern name servers give out resource records in round robin order by default. Only very old name servers  before BIND 4.9  don’t support round robin.  Remember that round robin isn’t load balancing. The name server has no idea how busy the web servers that serve www.foo.example’s content are, or even whether  2.7 Setting Up Round Robin Load Distribution    31  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   they’re all responding. If the web server at 10.0.0.1 were to crash, the name server would still give out its address first a third of the time. For true load balancing, you need something more than just DNS.  See Also Recipe 3.18 for details on how round robin works and how to disable it.  2.8  Adding a Domain Name in a Subdomain Without Creating a New Zone  Problem You want to add a domain name in a subdomain of your zone, but don’t want to cre- ate a new zone and delegate it from your current zone.  Solution Just add the records associated with the new domain name, specifying the subdo- main in the domain name. For example, to add the domain name a.b.foo.example to the foo.example zone, you could add this record to the foo.example zone data file:  a.b.foo.example.    IN    A    10.0.0.4  Doing this implicitly creates the subdomain b.foo.example and the domain name a.b.foo.example. The subdomain b.foo.example is part of the foo.example zone  as is the domain name a.b.foo.example , and will be included in transfers of the zone to slave name servers.  If the origin in the zone data file is foo.example, the default, you can also write the record as:  a.b        IN    A    10.0.0.4  Discussion Sometimes the solution to a problem is just the most obvious of the possibilities. That’s the case both with setting up round robin and with this problem. But many administrators—even the very experienced—aren’t accustomed to adding domain names to their zones that have multiple labels to the left of their zones’ domain names. They think of the domain names in their zones as always having the format host.domain-name-of-zone, rather than any number of labels ending in the domain name of the zone.  32    Chapter 2: Zone Data  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   See Also For more on intrazone subdomains, see “Creating a Subdomain in the Parent’s Zone” in Chapter 9 of DNS and BIND. If you do want to delegate the subdomain and create a new zone, see Recipe 6.1.  2.9  Preventing Remote Name Servers from Caching a Resource Record  Problem You want to prevent remote name servers from caching one or more records in your zone.  Solution Give the record  or records  an explicit—and low—time to live  TTL . For example, to keep other name servers from caching your web server’s addresses, you could add these A records to the zone data file:  www.foo.example.    1    IN    A    10.0.0.1 www.foo.example.    1    IN    A    10.0.0.2 www.foo.example.    1    IN    A    10.0.0.3  Specify the explicit TTL between the domain name owner of the record and the class field. By default, the value is an integer number of seconds. You can also use a scaled value, as you would in the $TTL control statement.  Discussion Note that the TTLs for the three www.foo.example A records are the same; that’s no accident. If you were to use different TTLs for records in the same RRset  of the same type, and attached to the same domain name , a remote name server might age only some of them out, leading to unpredictable results. Consequently, modern name servers notice this misconfiguration and “trim” mismatched TTLs within a sin- gle RRset to the smallest TTL of the group.  Why did I use a TTL of one instead of zero? After all, a zero TTL would seem to say, “Don’t cache this record.” Unfortunately, TTLs of zero tickle a bug in some older name servers, which age out the records before returning them to the resolver that initiated the query. D’oh!  2.9 Preventing Remote Name Servers from Caching a Resource Record    33  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   See Also Recipe 2.1 for the syntax of scaled values, and “Changing TTLs” in Chapter 8 of DNS and BIND.  2.10 Adding a Multihomed Host  Problem You want to add a multihomed host to DNS.  Solution Add multiple A records to the host’s domain name, one per IP address. For exam- ple, for a file server with two network interfaces, you might add these records:  fs.foo.example.    IN    A    10.0.0.9 fs.foo.example.    IN    A    192.168.0.9  To handle reverse mapping for the host, add one PTR record to each of the appropri- ate two reverse-mapping zones:  9.0.0.10.in-addr.arpa.    IN    PTR    fs.foo.example.  and  9.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa.    IN    PTR    fs.foo.example.  Discussion Clients looking up the address of fs.foo.example will see both IP addresses, and can choose which one to use  though most clients will just use the first address returned . Remember that, by default, they’ll be returned in round robin order.  For troubleshooting purposes, you may want to add two more A records, each of which maps to just one of your multihomed host’s addresses. For example:  fs-eth0.foo.example.    IN    A    10.0.0.9 fs-eth1.foo.example.    IN    A    192.168.0.9  This lets you test whether a particular network interface on the file server is up, by pinging fs-eth0.foo.example, for instance. You probably shouldn’t add PTR records mapping the addresses back to these interface-specific names, though: most soft- ware can’t handle multiple reverse mappings for a single IP address.  See Also Recipe 2.7 for the behavior of round robin, and Chapter 4 of DNS and BIND.  34    Chapter 2: Zone Data  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   2.11 Updating a Name Server’s Root Hints File  Problem You need to update a name server’s root hints file.  Solution FTP a copy of the most recent root hints file from ftp.rs.internic.net. It’s called named.root, in the directory domain.  Discussion The root hints file, which tells a name server the domain names and addresses of the root name servers, doesn’t need to be updated often. The “current” version dates to August 1997, and the file can be slightly out-of-date without causing adverse effects. Still, you should probably check every six months or so to see if it’s changed.  If you do download a new root hints file, remember to change the name of the file to whatever you have defined in your zone statement for the root hints, and then reload the name server.  See Also “The Root Hints Data” in Chapter 4 and “Keeping the Root Hints Current” in Chap- ter 7 of DNS and BIND.  2.12 Using a Single Data File for Multiple Zones  Problem You want to use a single data file for multiple zones.  Solution Create a “template” zone data file. Make sure that all of the owner names of records in the zone are “@”  short for the origin  or relative; that is, written without a trail- ing dot. For example:  @    IN    SOA    ns1.isp.net. hostmaster.isp.net.        2002040900      3600      900      604800      3600    2.12 Using a Single Data File for Multiple Zones    35  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Add zone statements to your name server’s named.conf file, configuring it as primary master for the various zones, and specifying the “template” zone data file in the file substatement each time. For example:      IN    NS    ns1.isp.net.     IN    NS    ns2.isp.net.      IN    MX    smtp.isp.net.      IN    A    192.168.0.99  www IN    CNAME    @  zone "foo.example" {     type master;     file "db.template"; };  zone "bar.example" {     type master;     file "db.template"; };  zone "baz.example" {     type master;     file "db.template"; };  Since each zone statement sets the default origin to the domain name of the zone in the data file, the SOA record and NS records will always end up attached to the right domain name, and the rest of the records will end up “translated” into the zone.  Discussion This technique will only work if all of the zones are very similar—nearly identical, in fact. The zones must contain the same number and mix of records, and the records in the zones can only differ by the domain name of the zone. For example, if the domain name www.foo.example is an alias for a.foo.example in the foo.example zone, then www.bar.example will be an alias for a.bar.example in the bar.example zone.  The name server must be the primary master for all of the zones; there’s no way to set up an equivalent slave name server that uses the same backup zone data file for all of its zones, since name servers write fully qualified domain names to backup zone data files.  Also, none of the zones can be dynamically updated, since dynamic updates to a zone would cause the name server to rewrite the zone data file, and the rewritten zone data file would also contain fully qualified domain names.  36    Chapter 2: Zone Data  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   See Also Recipe 2.1 for understanding the default origin of a zone data file.  2.13 Using Multiple Data Files for a Single Zone  Problem You want to break a zone into multiple data files, possibly to organize the large num- ber of resource records logically.  Solution Use the $INCLUDE control statement in your top-level zone data file, which inter- polates the contents of another file. For example, to include the contents of the file db.foo.example.hosts into the data file for the zone foo.example, you could use this $INCLUDE control statement:  $INCLUDE db.foo.example.hosts  Discussion The origin in the included file is, by default, the same as the origin in the file that includes it. If you’d like to change the origin in the included file, specify the new ori- gin as the second argument to the $INCLUDE control statement:  $INCLUDE db.subdomain.foo.example.hosts subdomain.foo.example  On the line after the $INCLUDE statement, the origin reverts to its previous setting.  See Also Recipe 2.8, which explains how to create a subdomain within the same zone.  2.14 Resetting Your Zone’s Serial Number  Problem You need to reset your serial number to some low value, possibly because you inad- vertently added a digit to it.  2.14 Resetting Your Zone’s Serial Number    37  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Solution If you’ve accidentally incremented your serial number to a value larger than 232 – 1  4,294,967,295 , first find out what your current serial number is—because it proba- bly isn’t what you think it is  the serial number is only 32 bits large . The easiest way to do this is to use a query tool, such as dig, to look up your zone’s SOA record:  $ dig soa foo.example  ;  > DiG 9.2.1  > soa foo.example ;; global options:  printcmd ;; Got answer: ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 4335 ;; flags: qr aa rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 2, ADDITIONAL: 2  ;; QUESTION SECTION: ;foo.example.                   IN      SOA  ;; ANSWER SECTION: foo.example.            86400   IN      SOA     ns1.foo.example. hostmaster.foo. example. 2002021239 3600 900 2592000 3600  If the current serial number is less than 2,147,483,647, add 2,147,483,647 to the serial number. Wait for all of your zone’s slave name servers to pick up the new ver- sion of the zone  if you’re using NOTIFY, that shouldn’t take long . Then set the serial number to your target.  If the current serial number is larger than 2,147,483,647, just set the serial number to the number you want.  Discussion Whahuh? Why on Earth does this work?  Name servers compare serial numbers using sequence space arithmetic, which ain’t your grandpa’s ’rithmetic. In sequence space arithmetic, you have a finite set of inte- gers, but each number has a “next” number. After 0 comes 1, then 2, all the way to 4,294,967,295  232 – 1 . The next number after 4,294,967,295 is 0. Think of it like a clock: The hour after 1:00 is 2:00, and the hour after 12:00 is 1:00.  Half of the numbers are larger than any given number, and the other half are smaller. With a set of 232 possible serial numbers, half  231 – 1, actually  are larger than any given serial number, and half are smaller.  Consider the serial number 1,000,000,000. The next 231 – 1 serial numbers, 1,000,000,001 through 3,147,483,647, are larger. The 231 – 1 serial numbers after that, 3,147,483,648 through 4,294,967,295  232 – 1  and 0 to 999,999,999, are smaller. Yes, Alice, in the world of serial numbers, 3,147,483,648 is smaller than 1,000,000,000.  38    Chapter 2: Zone Data  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   So when you add 2,147,483,647  231 – 1  to a serial number, you’re actually adding the largest increment possible—add a larger number and the result will actually be smaller than the old serial number, and your zone’s slaves won’t transfer the zone.  Once all the slaves have the new zone, you can simply set the serial number to the serial number you want, which is now considered larger than the current serial number.  If you’re not comfortable with this New Math, try out the script reset_serial.pl, included in the tar file that accompanies this book  see the Preface for where to get it . reset_serial.pl takes as arguments your current serial number and the serial num- ber you want to get to, and tells you how to get there.  There’s also a brute force method for resetting your serial number: set the serial number to your target in the zone data file. Then delete your zone’s backup data files on all of your slaves and restart named. Your slave name servers won’t have any choice but to transfer the zone, regardless of its serial number.  This won’t work if you don’t have administrative control of all of your slaves, of course, and it has all the elegance of using a flat-head screwdriver as a chisel.  See Also “Starting Over with a New Serial Number” in Chapter 7 of DNS and BIND, and RFC 1982 for an explanation of serial number arithmetic.  2.15 Making Manual Changes to a Dynamically  Updated Zone  Problem You want to edit a zone data file by hand, but the zone is dynamically updated.  Solution On a BIND 8 name server, stop the name server with ndc stop, delete the zone’s dynamic update log file  whose name is the name of the zone data file with .log appended, by default  and the IXFR log file, if any  whose name is the zone data file’s plus .ixfr . Then edit the zone data file and start the name server.  On a BIND 9 name server, stop the name server with rndc stop, delete the zone’s journal file  whose name is the zone data file’s with .jnl on the end , edit the zone data file and start the name server again.  On a BIND 9.3.0 or newer name server, you can freeze the zone with rndc freeze, edit the zone data file, and unfreeze the zone with rndc unfreeze.  2.15 Making Manual Changes to a Dynamically Updated Zone    39  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Discussion With dynamic zones, it’s better to make all changes to the zone using dynamic updates. However, sometimes that’s just not practical.  The problem is that, with most BIND name servers, if you edit a zone data file while the name server is running, you can lose your changes. When you restart the name server  reloading dynamic zones doesn’t work , the name server will rewrite the zone data file if it has received any dynamic updates to the zone that haven’t yet been writ- ten to the zone data file. What happens to your changes? Poof! They disappear with- out a trace, like so many dot-coms. You need to stop the name server before editing the zone data file. And that means your name server may miss dynamic updates while you’re manually editing the zone data file, so be quick about it!  Also, when you edit the zone data file manually, the changes you make don’t get entered into the dynamic update log—the .log file, for BIND 8, and the .jnl file for BIND 9. When the name server loads the zone data file and then checks the content of the log file, it discovers a gap: It’s missing the record of the last change, the one you made manually. So you have to delete the log file before loading.  The price of deleting the log file is that your zone’s slaves won’t be able to get an incremental zone transfer on their next try, since the record of the last change—nec- essary to get them up-to-date—is missing. They’ll request an incremental zone trans- fer but receive a full zone transfer instead.  The BIND 9.3.0 name server has two new rndc commands, freeze and unfreeze, which allow you to suspend and resume the processing of dynamic updates to a zone. freeze also deletes the log file. So you can rndc freeze the zone, edit the zone data file, then rndc unfreeze.  See Also Recipe 5.19, to learn how to use the nsupdate program to modify a zone.  2.16 Moving a Host  Problem You want to move a host from one address to another.  Solution At least one TTL before the move, reduce the TTL on the host’s A record and PTR record to a low number, like 60 seconds. For example, say you’re planning on mov- ing the host z.foo.example. If its current A record looks like this:  z.foo.example.    86400    IN    A    192.168.0.254  40    Chapter 2: Zone Data  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Reduce the TTL at least a day  86,400 seconds  ahead of time, like this:  z.foo.example.    60    IN    A    192.168.0.254  At the same time, reduce the TTL on the host’s PTR record:  254.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa.    60    IN    PTR    z.foo.example.  Then, after you’ve moved the host, change the A record to reflect the host’s new address and restore the TTL:  z.foo.example.    86400    IN    A    10.0.0.254  Delete the old PTR record and add one  to the appropriate zone data file!  for the new address:  254.0.0.10.in-addr.arpa.    86400    IN    PTR    z.foo.example.  Discussion You need to reduce the TTL on the old records ahead of time to keep name servers from caching them just before the move. If you left the TTL alone, a remote name server could cache the old address just before you made the change, and it would take some time for that record to time out. If you don’t use NOTIFY, you should also add in the refresh time of the zones the records are in, since it could take that long for the lower TTL records to make it out to all of your slaves.  This technique applies to more than just A and PTR records, of course. You could just as easily use it to change MX records or any other record type. If it’s a name server you’re moving, however, or you need to change your zone’s NS records, see Recipes 6.6 and 6.7.  Notice that the new PTR record may well belong in a different zone data file than the old one.  See Also Recipe 2.9, for an explanation how to reduce the TTL on a single record; Recipes 6.6 and 6.7, for moving a name server and changing all of a zone’s name servers; and “Changing TTLs” in Chapter 8 of DNS and BIND.  2.17 Mapping Any Domain Name in a Zone  to a Single IP Address  Problem You want to map every domain name in a zone to a single IP address.  2.17 Mapping Any Domain Name in a Zone to a Single IP Address    41  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Solution Add an A record to the zone attached to the wildcard domain name. For example:  *.foo.example.    IN    A    10.0.0.1  Discussion Technically, this record doesn’t map every domain name in the zone to 10.0.0.1. In fact, the wildcard domain name doesn’t apply to domain names in the zone data file. Say you also had the domain name ns1.foo.example in the foo.example zone:  ns1.foo.example.    IN    A    192.168.0.1  The wildcard domain name wouldn’t match queries for the address of ns1.foo. example, which is probably a good thing, since ns1.foo.example has a different address. The wildcard domain name wouldn’t apply to domain names that own other types of records, either. For example, you might have this record in the zone:  text.foo.example.    IN    TXT    "Text comment"  Queries for the address of text.foo.example would return an empty answer, because text.foo.example has no addresses.  So what does the wildcard domain name apply to? Queries for domain names in the zone that don’t appear in the zone data file, which means any domain name you can think of that ends in foo.example, doesn’t appear in the foo.example zone data file, and isn’t part of a delegated subdomain of foo.example.  Wildcard domain names can own other types of records, too. Take, for example, this CNAME record:  *.foo.example.    IN    CNAME    foo.example.  This creates aliases from any domain name in the zone without explicit records attached to the domain name foo.example. So if you leave out explicit records for www.foo.example, someone looking up www.foo.example would find that domain name is an alias for foo.example. Someone looking up zaphod.beeblebrox.foo.example would find that it, too, is an alias for foo.example—assuming you didn’t have any records attached to the domain name zaphod.beeblebrox.foo.example, that is. So you might think of a wildcard as a “default” domain name for a zone: any explicit domain name in the zone has only the records you give it, but the wildcard applies to every other domain name in the zone.  As the zaphod.beeblebrox.foo.example example suggests, wildcards can match more than one label. In fact, a wildcard matches zero or more labels. The wildcard domain name in the CNAME record wouldn’t match just foo.example, though, since even at zero labels, *.foo.example has one more dot than foo.example.  42    Chapter 2: Zone Data  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   See Also “Wildcards” in Chapter 16 of DNS and BIND.  2.18 Adding Similar Records  Problem You want to add a number of records that differ only slightly.  Solution Use the $GENERATE control statement to specify a template that the name server will use to generate a group of similar records. For example, to add a series of PTR records that differ only by a single digit, you could use this $GENERATE control statement:  $GENERATE 11-20 $.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa. PTR dhcp-$.foo.example.  Your BIND name server will read the range  11–20  and it will also read the tem- plate  $.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa. PTR dhcp-$.foo.example.  from the $GENERATE control statement. Then it will iterate through the range, replacing any dollar signs  “$”  in the template with the current value, creating 10 PTR records:  11.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa. PTR dhcp-11.foo.example. 12.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa. PTR dhcp-12.foo.example. 13.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa. PTR dhcp-13.foo.example. ... 20.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa. PTR dhcp-20.foo.example.  Discussion $GENERATE supports a limited set of record types: A, AAAA, CNAME, DNAME, NS and PTR. Also, the template can’t contain a TTL or a class field, just a type.  If you want to get fancy, you can also step through the range using the range format start-stop range. So 0–100 2 would count from 0 to 100 by twos.  BIND 8.2 introduced $GENERATE to the world. BIND 9.1.0 introduced $GENERATE to the BIND 9 releases.  Note that, unlike the $INCLUDE and $ORIGIN control statements, $GENERATE is only supported by BIND name servers; you can’t use it in a zone data file on a Microsoft DNS Server, for example.

Solution Give your servers “functional” domain names. For example, most users will expect to find an organization’s FTP server at the domain name ftp.domain-name-of-zone. In most cases, the domain name can be an alias for the canonical name of the host run- ning the service; that’s not possible with name servers or mail servers, though.  Other common functional domain names include:  domain-name-of-zone  The zone’s domain name, by convention, owns one or more A records that point to the organization’s web server, and one or more MX records that tell mailers where to deliver mail addressed to the organization’s users.  imap.domain-name-of-zone An IMAP mail server. mail.domain-name-of-zone  An SMTP mail server. Note that this domain name can’t be an alias; it must own an A record. Moreover, the mail server must recognize itself as this domain name in order to prevent mail loops.  ns[N].domain-name-of-zone  The authoritative name servers for your zone. Since there are often more than one, use an integer to distinguish between them: ns1, ns2, etc. Or, for the unapologetically geeky, ns0, ns1, etc. Note that these domain names can’t be aliases; they must own A records.  An NTP  Network Time Protocol  server. If you have more than one, disambigu- ate them by using ntp1, ntp2, etc.  ntp.domain-name-of-zone  pop.domain-name-of-zone  A POP mail server.  44    Chapter 2: Zone Data  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   smtp.domain-name-of-zone  www.domain-name-of-zone  An alternative to mail.domain-name-of-zone. As with mail.domain-name-of-zone, this must own an A record.  This convention is so common it’s almost not worth discussing, but most users expect to find an organization’s web site here.  Discussion One big benefit of using functional domain names is that you can move a service from one host to another by changing only the A or CNAME record for the functional domain name, and without changing the configuration of every client of that service. For example, if you moved your NTP server from a.foo.example to b.foo.example, you could just change the ntp.foo.example CNAME record to:  ntp.foo.example.    IN    CNAME    b.foo.example.  Assuming you’d configured your NTP clients to refer to your NTP server by the domain name ntp.foo.example, you wouldn’t have to make any changes to your cli- ents’ configuration.  The domain names of mail servers and name servers are special because of the way they’re used. The domain name of a name server will usually appear in an NS record, delegating a zone to that name server. A name server sending that NS record in a refer- ral will only add A records for the name server’s domain name to the response. If the domain name owns a CNAME record, the name server won’t find it.  Likewise, mail servers sending mail to your email addresses expect to find A records for the mail servers you list in your MX records. If you use CNAME records, they won’t find the address they’re after.  Also, if one of your backup mail servers receives the email, it will “trim” the list of MX records by removing itself and any less-preferred mail servers. If it doesn’t recog- nize itself in the list because you’ve used an alias in an MX record, it may try to send mail to itself, or to a less-preferred mail server.  2.20 Storing the Location of a Host in DNS  Problem You want to store the location of a host in your zone data.  2.20 Storing the Location of a Host in DNS    45  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Solution Depending on what you mean by “location,” add either a TXT or LOC record to the host’s domain name.  Many administrators want to store a descriptive location for the host in DNS. For example, you might want to specify that the host a.foo.example is in on your Building 20’s level C, near post C3K. To do that, you might add this TXT record to your zone:  a.foo.example.    IN    TXT    "Building 20, level C, post C3K"  If, on the other hand, you’d like to specify the host’s geographical location  i.e., its latitude, longitude, and altitude , you can add a LOC record to your zone. For exam- ple, if a.foo.example is also at 40 degrees, 2 minutes, 0.373 seconds north latitude; 105 degrees, 17 minutes, 23.528 seconds west longitude; and 1,638 meters altitude, you could add this LOC record to your zone:  a.foo.example.    IN    LOC    40 2 0.373 N 105 17 23.528 W 1638m  Discussion The TXT record is enormously versatile, since you can put just about anything into the RDATA. Just remember that only people who know to look up the TXT records for a domain name will find the data you store there. Also, if you add multiple TXT records to a domain name, there’s no guarantee of the order in which the name server will return them.  The LOC record, on the other hand, is absolutely specialized: it only stores geo- graphical location data. The format is exactly as I’ve shown it above, with separate RDATA fields for degrees, minutes, and seconds, followed by N for north, S for south, E for east, and W for west.

Solution Use a tool such as h2n to filter your host table into the corresponding zone data files. With h2n, you specify the domain name of a forward-mapping zone to create as the argument to the –d option and the networks associated with that zone as the argu- ment to one or more –n options. For example, the following command would build data files for the foo.example and 168.192.in-addr.arpa zones:  % h2n –d foo.example –n 192.168  These zone data files would each contain a SOA record and an NS record pointing to the local host, as well as A records or PTR records for hosts in  etc hosts on the 192.168 16 network. Additional options allow you to create other records, includ- ing NS records pointing to other name servers.  Discussion You can get a copy of h2n from the tar ball that accompanies DNS and BIND, ftp.oreilly.com published oreilly nutshell dnsbind dns.tar.Z. Also, Andris located at Kalnozols of Hewlett-Packard has enhanced h2n significantly; he makes his souped- up version available at ftp.hpl.hp.com pub h2n h2n.tar.gz.  There are other tools available for filtering host table-format data into zone data files; h2n is only one option. Take a look at the contents of bind-contrib.tar.gz, available in the same directory as the latest BIND 8 release, for some of your options.

Back then, all you needed was four, maybe five configuration directives. Nowadays, most of the 10 or so configuration statements can have a nested structure with countless substatements—nearly 100 for the options statement in the latest BIND 9 name server!  This chapter shows how to put those configuration statements and substatements together in sensible ways to produce useful results, like differentiating the response a name server gives out based on the querier’s IP address  Recipe 3.17 . Related recipes are grouped together, beginning with recipes about configuring a name server’s con- trol channel  Recipes 3.1 through 3.3  and progressing into more intricate, more arcane subjects, including dynamic update  Recipes 3.10 and 3.11  and forwarding  Recipes 3. 14, 3.15, and 3.16 .  When adapting these recipes for use in a name server’s named.conf file, remember these syntactic rules:    Terminate each statement and each substatement with a semicolon. It’s just like buying toys for your kids: if each one gets an identical semicolon, everybody’s happy. If you forget a semicolon for one, or somebody gets a colon or a period instead, there’s hell to pay.    Enclose all lists  of substatements, addresses, whatever  in curly braces, even if the  list only contains one element—or, for a forwarders substatement, no elements!    Double-quote all filenames and domain names.   Define keys and ACLs before you use them.*  * With newer versions of BIND 9, you can refer to keys and ACLs before you define them.  48  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   3.1  Conﬁguring a Name Server to Work with ndc  Problem You want to use ndc, the name daemon controller, to control a BIND 8 name server.  Solution Add a controls statement to the name server’s named.conf file. The controls state- ment tells the name server to create a control channel and to listen on that channel for control messages from ndc. BIND 8 supports two kinds of control channels:  unix  inet  A Unix domain socket that the name server creates on the local filesystem. ndc sends messages to the name server by writing to the Unix domain socket.  A TCP socket that the name server listens on. ndc sends messages to the name server by connecting to the TCP socket.  By default, BIND 8 name servers use a unix control channel, creating a Unix domain socket with a path compiled into the named code. Normally, ndc is compiled with the same path.  To specify an alternate pathname, use the unix substatement of the controls statement:  controls {     unix " var run ndc" owner 0 group 0 perm 0660; };  The first argument to the unix substatement is the path to use when creating the Unix domain socket. Successive arguments may appear in any order, and specify the user ID and group ID to use when creating the socket, as well as the permissions to use.  You must use numeric IDs, not user or group names.  Make sure the socket isn’t writeable by anyone who shouldn’t be able to control the name server.  To tell ndc to write to a Unix domain socket other than its default, use the –l com- mand-line option, which takes the path to the socket as an option argument. For example:   ndc –l  var run ndc  To use an inet control channel, use the inet substatement:  controls {     inet * port 953 allow { localhost; }; };  3.1 Configuring a Name Server to Work with ndc    49  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   The first argument is the IP address of the network interface the name server should listen on for control messages; “*” means all of them. Successive arguments specify the port to listen on and an access control list that determines who can connect to the port.  To tell ndc to connect to a particular address and port, use the –c command-line option, which takes an IP address and a port number, separated by a slash, as an option argument. For example:   ndc –c 127.0.0.1 953  Discussion The Solaris operating system doesn’t properly check the permissions on Unix domain sockets. Consequently, the name server will create a separate directory for the socket by default, and will set the permissions on that directory to allow access only to authorized users.  BIND 8’s inet control channels, because they use source IP addresses to identify and authorize control messages, aren’t secure. Use unix control channels if you can.  BIND 8 doesn’t have a default port for control messages, so you must specify one. BIND 9, however, uses port 953 by default, so I usually use port 953 on BIND 8 name servers, too.  unix and inet control channels aren’t an either-or proposition: You can use both at once if you want to. As I’ve said, though, inet control channels are fairly dangerous.  Note that BIND 9 uses a different program, rndc, to control the name server.  See Also Recipe 3.2 for configuring rndc, ndc’s BIND 9 counterpart, and “ndc and controls  BIND 8 ” in Chapter 7 of DNS and BIND.  3.2  Conﬁguring a Name Server to Work with rndc  Problem You want to use rndc, the remote name daemon controller, to control a local BIND 9 name server.  50    Chapter 3: BIND Name Server Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Solution By far the easiest way to get rndc working with a name server is to use rndc-confgen, a program shipped with the BIND distribution. rndc, unlike ndc, its BIND 8 counter- part, requires a configuration file to work properly. The configuration file’s syntax, mercifully, is very similar to that of named.conf. But rather than learning the new syntax, you can run rndc-confgen on the host that will run the name server to gener- ate a useable configuration file. For example, running rndc-confgen might produce output like this:  $ rndc-confgen  Start of rndc.conf key "rndc-key" {         algorithm hmac-md5;         secret "LctVnbqQQPHiZJ80ZwnFDA=="; };  options {         default-key "rndc-key";         default-server 127.0.0.1;         default-port 953; };  End of rndc.conf   Use with the following in named.conf, adjusting the allow list as needed:  key "rndc-key" {        algorithm hmac-md5;        secret "LctVnbqQQPHiZJ80ZwnFDA==";  };   controls {        inet 127.0.0.1 port 953                allow { 127.0.0.1; } keys { "rndc-key"; };  };  End of named.conf  The beginning of the output  the uncommented part  is the contents of rndc.conf, rndc’s configuration file. rndc will expect to find it in a particular location. If you’re not sure what that location is, running an innocuous command like rndc status will tell you where it’s looking:   rndc status rndc: neither  etc rndc.conf nor  etc rndc.key was found  Save the contents of the file there.  The commented part of the file belongs in the name server’s named.conf file. If you haven’t already added a controls statement, you can add it to named.conf as-is.  3.2 Configuring a Name Server to Work with rndc    51  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Discussion rndc-confgen appeared in BIND 9.2.0. The configuration files it generates, however, work with older versions of BIND 9, too. So if you’re running a version prior to 9.2.0, you can still build 9.2.0 and use the rndc-confgen program from that distribution.  With BIND 9.2.0 and later, there’s an even easier way to get this working: just run rndc-confgen –a on the host that will run the name server. This will write a key defi- nition to the file  etc rndc.key, which rndc and named will then use to negotiate a control channel between them. If you use this option, make sure you don’t have a controls statement in named.conf or an rndc.conf file—either of those would override the automatic configuration.  See Also “rndc and controls” in Chapter 7 of DNS and BIND.  3.3  Using rndc with a Remote Name Server  Problem You want to use rndc to manage a remote name server.  Solution If you used rndc-confgen to configure a name server’s control channel, the name server’s named.conf file probably contains key and controls statements like these:  key "rndc-key" {         algorithm hmac-md5;         secret "LctVnbqQQPHiZJ80ZwnFDA=="; };  controls {     inet 127.0.0.1 port 953     allow { 127.0.0.1; } keys { "rndc-key"; }; };  Modify the controls statement so that the name server listens on all of the local host’s IP addresses for control messages, not just the loopback address. Also, change the access control list in the allow substatement to allow connections from the address where you’ll run rndc. It’ll end up looking something like this:  controls {     inet * port 953     allow { 127.0.0.1; 192.168.0.7; } keys { "rndc-key"; }; };  52    Chapter 3: BIND Name Server Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   On the host you want to run rndc from, create an rndc.conf file.  The file normally belongs in the  etc directory.  Add a key statement identical to the one in named.conf:  Then add an options statement, specifying the default name server to control and the default key to use to sign commands:  key "rndc-key" {         algorithm hmac-md5;         secret "LctVnbqQQPHiZJ80ZwnFDA=="; };  options {     default-server 192.168.0.1;     default-key "rndc-key"; };   rndc reload foo.example  rndc should now work from the command line with a single argument. For example:  Discussion If the name server’s named.conf file didn’t have a controls statement to begin with, add one similar to the controls statement in the solution. Then add a key statement defining a key to use to sign control messages. You can generate a key with the dnssec-keygen program that’s included with the BIND distribution:  $ dnssec-keygen –a HMAC-MD5 –b 128 –n HOST rndc-key Krndc-key.+157+22603  See Recipe 7.9 for instructions on how to drive dnssec-keygen.  The file Krndc-key.+157+22603.key contains:  rndc-key. IN KEY 512 3 157 XvqePraEZOjNklEMu5lfzw==  Add a key statement to the name server’s named.conf file defining the new key:  key "rndc-key" {     algorithm hmac-md5;     secret "XvqePraEZOjNklEMu5lfzw=="; };  Add the same key statement to the rndc.conf file on the host you’ll run rndc from, as well as an options statement like the one shown above.  If you need to control more than one name server from a single host, add server statements to rndc.conf. The argument to the server statement is either the name or the address of the name server.  If you use a name, the name must resolve to the address of the name server.  In each server statement, you can define a different key to use to sign control messages to that server. For example:  server ns2.foo.example {     key ns2.foo.example.key; };  3.3 Using rndc with a Remote Name Server    53  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Of course, you’ll also need key statements for each unique key.  Once you’ve set up rndc.conf, you can tell rndc to control a particular name server with the –s command-line option:   rndc –s ns2.foo.example flush  Make sure the argument you specify with –s matches the argument you used in the server statement exactly or rndc won’t find the corresponding key.  See Also Recipe 3.2 for setting up rndc with a local BIND 9 name server, Recipe 7.9 for instructions on using dnssec-keygen, and “rndc and controls  BIND 9 ” in Chapter 7 of DNS and BIND.  3.4  Allowing “Illegal” Characters in Domain Names  Problem You need to configure a BIND 8 name server to allow one or more domain names that include illegal characters in your zone.  Solution Use the check-names substatement within the zone’s zone statement in named.conf. For example:  zone "foo.example" {     type master;     file "db.foo.example";     check-names warn; };  warn tells the name server to alert you to illegal domain names with messages sent to syslog, by default. You can also choose ignore, which tells the name server to shut up and say nothing about illegal domain names.  Discussion The whole notion of “illegal” domain names disappeared in BIND 9, which did away with name checking. You can include underscores, punctuation, and almost any- thing else in a domain name and load it on a BIND 9 name server. That’s not a par- ticularly good idea in most cases, but you can.  54    Chapter 3: BIND Name Server Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Many of you still run BIND 8 name servers, though, and they check domain names. In fact, they won’t load primary master zones with illegal domain names in them, by default, so you may need to change these settings.  You can set BIND 8’s name-checking behavior for all zones by using check-names as an options substatement. As an options substatement, check-names also specifies the context in which an illegal domain name is found:  Primary  Slave  Response  In a zone the name server is the primary master for  In a zone the name server is a slave for  In a response from a remote name server  options {         directory " var named";         check-names primary warn; };  For example, you could allow illegal domain names in all primary master zones with:  It’s a bad idea to allow illegal characters in responses from remote name servers, since it could subject your name server and your resolvers to certain attacks.  See Also “Host Name Checking  BIND 4.9.4 and Later Versions ” in Chapter 4 of DNS and BIND.  3.5  Dividing a Large named.conf File into Multiple Files  Problem You want to divide a name server’s named.conf file into multiple files.  Solution Use the include statement. For example, to include the file primary.conf, which con- tains all of a name server’s primary master zone statements, and the file slave.conf, which contains the name server’s slave zone statements, you could add these include statements to named.conf:  include "primary.conf"; include "slave.conf";  3.5 Dividing a Large named.conf File into Multiple Files    55  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Discussion By default, the name server looks for the files you include in its working directory. To include files in other directories, specify the full path to the file. For example:  include " etc primary.conf"; include " etc slave.conf";  The include statement is usually used as a top-level statement; however, BIND 9.2.0 and later name servers allow include within most other statements.  See Also If a name server is authoritative for so many zones that you need to break up the named.conf file, you may also need to use several directories for the zone data files, as described in Recipe 3.6. Also see “Using Several Directories” in Chapter 7 of DNS and BIND.  3.6  Organizing Zone Data Files in Different Directories  Problem You want to organize your zone data files in different directories.  Solution Specify the full path or a relative path to the zone data files in the zones’ file substate- ments. For example:  zone "foo.example" {     type master;     file " var named masters db.foo.example"; };  zone "bar.example" {     type slave;     masters { 192.168.1.1; };     file " var named slaves bak.bar.example"; };  Or, using relative paths:  zone "foo.example" {     type master;     file "masters db.foo.example"; };  56    Chapter 3: BIND Name Server Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   zone "bar.example" {     type slave;     masters { 192.168.1.1; };     file "slaves bak.bar.example"; };  Relative paths are interpreted relative to the name server’s working directory.  Discussion Splitting zone data files into one directory for primary master zones and one for slave zones is handy, but on a name server with hundreds or thousands of zones, you may still end up with an unwieldy number of zone data files in each directory. On a name server like that, you might create 26 subdirectories, named “a” through “z.” Then you could organize data files into subdirectories according to the first letter of the zone’s domain name. Or you could create subdirectories after the last label of a zone’s domain name, and each of those subdirectories could have subdirectories named for the next-to-last label, and so on, like so:         example       example db.foo      example bak.bar      arpa       arpa in-addr       arpa in-addr 192       arpa in-addr 192 168       arpa in-addr 192 168 db.0  This makes it easy to find a zone data file and keeps directories small.  See Also Recipe 3.5 and “Using Several Directories” in Chapter 7 of DNS and BIND.  3.7  Conﬁguring a Name Server as Slave for All of Your Zones  Problem You want to configure a name server as a slave for all of the zones your primary mas- ter name server is authoritative for.  3.7 Configuring a Name Server as Slave for All of Your Zones    57  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Solution Add zone statements of type slave to correspond to all of the zone statements in your primary master name server’s named.conf file. You can even use the primary master name server’s named.conf file as a starting point, changing master to slave in each type substatement and adding masters substatements, specifying the master’s address. You may also want to change the filename in the file substatement.  Discussion Many new administrators expect BIND to support a single configuration statement that says, “Run as a slave name server for all of the zones this other name server is authoritative for.” Unfortunately, no such statement exists; a name server is config- ured as authoritative for zones on an individual basis.  Converting a primary master’s named.conf file into a named.conf file appropriate for a slave is a piece of cake, though. In fact, I wrote a short Perl script, called makeslaveconf.pl, that automates the conversion. It’s available in the tar file that complements this book; see the Preface for details.  See Also Recipe 1.16 for instructions on configuring a name server as a slave for a zone.  3.8  Finding an Offsite Slave Name Server for Your Zone  Problem You need to find an offsite slave name server for one or more of your zones.  Solution Ask your ISP whether slave name service is included in the package of services they offer you. If not, ask whether they offer the service for an additional cost.  If your ISP is unable or unwilling to handle slave name service for your zones, there are alternatives available. Nominum offers free slave name service for noncommer- cial use at http:  www.secondary.com . Nominum also operates a commercial slave- hosting service, called GNS  Global Name Service , at http:  www.nominum.com  services gns , as does UltraDNS, at http:  www.secondarydns.com .  Finally, you may want to consider trading slave name service with another organiza- tion, say a partner company or a university you have a close relationship with.  58    Chapter 3: BIND Name Server Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Discussion Far too many organizations have a single point of failure in their DNS infrastructure: all of their authoritative name servers on the Internet are located on the same subnet, behind a single router. While many of these organizations would like to have an exter- nal slave name server, they’re often scared off by the perceived expense of such a solu- tion. But remember that you probably don’t need to set up your very own offsite slave; many companies run slave name servers that are authoritative for thousands of zones, and they’d be willing to load your zone, too, for a reasonable sum of money.  See Also Recipe 1.16 for instructions on configuring a name server as a slave for a zone.  3.9  Protecting a Slave Name Server from Abuse  Problem You want to protect a slave name server from abuse by the maintainers of the zone.  Solution Use the BIND 9 min-refresh-time, min-retry-time, max-transfer-time-in, max-transfer- idle-in, and additional-from-auth substatements.  min-refresh-time and min-retry-time are useful in guarding against the zone’s admin- istrator’s either accidentally or deliberately setting his zone’s refresh or retry times too low. For example:  zone "bar.example" {     type slave;     masters { 192.168.0.199; };     file "bak.bar.example";     min-refresh-time 3600;       1 hour minimum refresh };  max-transfer-time-in and max-transfer-idle-in allow you to specify how long the name server will wait for a transfer of the zone to complete, and how long it will wait while the transfer is idle  i.e., isn’t making progress . For example:  options     directory " var named";     max-transfer-time-in 1800;       max transfer time 30 minutes     max-transfer-idle-in 900;        max transfer idle 15 minutes };  3.9 Protecting a Slave Name Server from Abuse    59  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Finally, in order to keep the name server from adding records to the additional data section of responses that come from slave zones, use the additional-from-auth options substatement  options {     directory " var named";     additional-from-auth no; };  Discussion You can use min-refresh-time and min-retry-time as options or zone substatements. As a zone substatement, the limit applies only to that zone. As an options substate- ment, the limit applies to all zones that don’t have an explicit limit.  See Also Recipe 1.16 for instructions on configuring a name server as a slave for a zone and “Zone Transfers” in Chapter 10 of DNS and BIND.  3.10 Allowing Dynamic Updates  Problem You want to allow dynamic updates to one of your zones.  Solution Use the allow-update zone substatement. For example:  zone "foo.example" {     type master;     file "db.foo.example";     allow-update { 192.168.0.4; }; };  This allows dynamic updates to the foo.example zone from the IP address 192.168.0.4. You can specify multiple addresses, or a whole range of addresses, but that’s gener- ally a bad idea: You want to restrict dynamic updates as much as possible, since an updater allowed via allow-update can make just about any change to the zone.  In fact, if you run a BIND 9 name server and the software sending dynamic updates supports TSIG-signed updates, you should use the new update-policy substatement. update-policy lets you determine which domain names and records a particular updater is allowed to update. update-policy substatements have the following format:  60    Chapter 3: BIND Name Server Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   update-policy {     grantdeny keyname nametype domain-name [type [...]];     [...] };  The keyname field is the name of the TSIG key used to sign the dynamic update. The nametype is one of these four values:  name  subdomain  wildcard  self  Matches when the updated domain name is the same as the name in the domain- name field.  Matches when the updated domain name is a subdomain  that is, ends in or is the same as  the name in the domain-name field.  Matches when the updated domain name matches the wildcard expression in the domain-name field. Only the leftmost label in the expression can be a wild- card character.  Matches when the updated domain name is the same as the name of the TSIG key that signed the update. The contents of the domain-name field are ignored, but the field needs to be present.  The type is a record type, such as A, MX, and NS. You can use ANY as shorthand for all record types except NXT. If you omit the field, the default is to allow updates to all types except SOA, NS, SIG, and NXT.  So, for example, in order to restrict dynamic updates to A records for the domain name www.foo.example to updates signed with the key update-key, you could use this update-policy substatement:  zone "foo.example" {     type master;     file "db.foo.example";     update-policy {         grant update-key name www.foo.example A;     }; };  Discussion allow-update really isn’t secure, since it authorizes updates on the basis of the source IP address in the dynamic update message. And dynamic updates are UDP-based, so they’re easy to spoof. Unfortunately, there’s very little software that supports TSIG- signed dynamic updates—yet.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  3.10 Allowing Dynamic Updates    61   If you allow dynamic updates to a zone, make sure the MNAME field of the zone’s SOA record contains the domain name of the primary master name server; ideally, that’s where updaters will send their updates.  The allow-update and update-policy substatements are only meaningful in zone state- ments of type master, since you can only modify data on a zone’s primary master name server.  See Also Recipes 5.20 and 5.21, for information on how to send dynamic updates using nsupdate; Recipe 5.22, for sending TSIG-signed updates using nsupdate; Recipe 8.9, for a more complex example of update-policy; Recipes 9.9 and 9.10, to learn how to send updates programmatically; and “DNS Dynamic Update” in Chapter 10 of DNS and BIND.  3.11 Conﬁguring a Name Server to Forward  Dynamic Updates  Problem You want a BIND 9 slave name server to forward any dynamic updates it receives from addresses on the local networks for a zone to its master name server.  Solution Use the allow-update-forwarding zone substatement. For example:  zone "foo.example" {     type slave;     masters { 192.168.0.1; };     file "bak.foo.example";     allow-update-forwarding { localnets; }; };  The slave name server forwards any dynamic updates it receives to the foo.example zone to its master name server, at 192.168.0.1.  Discussion For the most part, if you make sure that your zone’s SOA record contains the domain name of the primary master name server in the MNAME field, you won’t need to worry about update forwarding. Most updaters will automatically find your primary master and send their updates there. But if you use a hidden primary master or have ill-behaved clients, you may need this.  62    Chapter 3: BIND Name Server Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Forwarding updates, however, makes IP address-based authorization using allow- update even more dangerous than usual, because forwarded updates have the slave name server’s source address. If you use update forwarding, you should use TSIG- signed dynamic updates, too. It doesn’t matter if a slave forwards a signed update: it still bears the signature.  See Also Recipe 3.10 for permitting dynamic updates; Recipes 5.19, 5.20, and 5.22 for send- ing dynamic updates—particularly TSIG-signed updates—using nsupdate; Recipes 9.9 and 9.10 for sending updates programmatically; and “TSIG-Signed Updates” in Chapter 10 of DNS and BIND.  3.12 Notifying a Slave Name Server  Not in a Zone’s NS Records  Problem You want to notify a slave name server not listed in the NS records for a zone of changes to that zone’s serial number.  Solution Use the also-notify substatement as a zone substatement, to apply only to changes to that zone:  zone "foo.example" {     type master;     file "db.foo.example";     also-notify { 192.168.0.2; }; };  options {     directory " var named";     also-notify { 192.168.0.2; }; };  Or use it as a substatement to the options statement, to apply to all zones for which this name server is authoritative:  Discussion There are lots of reasons not to list a slave name server in a zone’s NS records; you’ve made it a slave because the resolvers that query it frequently look up records in the zone, but you don’t want other name servers querying it, for example. This kind of a  3.12 Notifying a Slave Name Server Not in a Zone’s NS Records    63  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   slave name server is called a stealth slave. See Recipe 7.4 for instructions on configur- ing a stealth slave.  However, you probably want your stealth slave to be alerted of changes to the zone as quickly as the other slaves for the zone. Since the other authoritative name servers for the zone have no automatic way of discovering your stealth slave, you need to explicitly configure the slave’s master name server to send it NOTIFY messages. Remember to configure only your stealth slave’s master name server to notify it—it’ll ignore NOTIFY messages from other name servers.  Note that also-notify isn’t supported as an options substatement in older versions of BIND 8. Support was introduced in BIND 8.2.2.  See Also Recipe 7.4 for instructions on configuring a stealth slave name server and “DNS NOTIFY  Zone Change Notification ” in Chapter 10 of DNS and BIND.  3.13 Limiting NOTIFY Messages  Problem You want to limit the NOTIFY messages your zone’s name servers send to the bare minimum. Unfortunately, by default, your zone’s primary master name server will send NOTIFY messages to all of the zone’s slaves, and the slaves will send NOTIFY messages to each other.  This behavior is intended to deal with slave name servers that get their zone transfers from other slaves.   Solution Turn NOTIFY off on the slave name servers, or configure those slaves that act as master name servers to notify only the slaves that transfer from them.  Turning NOTIFY off is simple. Use the notify substatement, either within a zone statement  to turn off NOTIFY messages for just that zone :  zone "foo.example" {     type slave;     masters { 192.168.0.1; };     file "bak.foo.example";     notify no; };  Or within the options statement, to make not sending NOTIFY messages the default for this name server:  64    Chapter 3: BIND Name Server Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   To limit NOTIFY messages to just an explicit list of name servers, use the notify explicit substatement and define the list of name servers in an also-notify substatement:  options {     directory " var named";     notify no; };  zone "foo.example" {     type slave;     masters { 192.168.0.1; };     file "bak.foo.eample";     notify explicit;     also-notify { 192.168.0.3; }; };  notify explicit is supported in BIND 9.1.0 and later, and BIND 8.3.2 and later.  Of course, notify explicit also works as an options statement.  Discussion The authoritative name servers for a zone “discover” which other name servers to notify from the zone’s NS records. Normally, all of the zone’s authoritative name servers are listed in the NS records, including the primary master and all of the slaves. If the primary master is listed in the MNAME  first RDATA  field of the zone’s SOA record, the slaves won’t notify it of changes. They will send NOTIFY messages to each other, though.  Though each NOTIFY message is relatively small, a change to a zone with a lot of name servers can trigger a blizzard of messages, as each slave name server tells every other slave that the zone has changed. Slaves ignore NOTIFY messages that don’t come from their master name servers, so most of this traffic is wasted. It reminds me of sitting in the back of the car with my sister:  Mom: You two be quiet! Me: Yeah, shut up. Sis: No, you shut up.  Since my sister never listened to me and I never listened to my sister, there wasn’t much point in our telling each other to shut up. My mother, of course, needed to tell both of us, or else we never would have shut up.  See Also Recipe 3.12 for the use of also-notify and “DNS NOTIFY  Zone Change Notifica- tion ” in Chapter 10 of DNS and BIND.

Solution Use the forwarders options substatement to configure a forwarder for the name server. For example:  options {     directory " var named";     forwarders { 192.168.0.1; }; };  The name server will forward any query it can’t answer locally—that is, from author- itative zone data or from cache—to the forwarder.  Discussion Since a name server configured to use forwarders relies on them for most name reso- lution, it’s a good idea to list multiple forwarders. The name server will query them in the order you list them until it receives an answer.  BIND 8.2.3 and later name servers will first query the one in the list that’s responding most quickly, which is even better.   The default behavior of a name server configured to use one or more forwarders is to revert to iterative name resolution if the forwarders don’t respond in about 60 sec- onds. To tell the name server to rely solely on the forwarders, and never try iterative name resolution, use the forward options substatement, set to only:  options {     directory " var named";     forwarders { 192.168.0.1; };     forward only; };  This “forward only” mode is actually preferable to the default behavior, because the forwarding timeout is so long that most resolvers have already given up on the name server before it even begins iterative name resolution.  66    Chapter 3: BIND Name Server Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   See Also Recipe 3.15 for how to forward only queries for certain domain names, Recipe 3.16 for how to configure a name server not to forward queries for certain domain names, and “Forwarding” in Chapter 10 of DNS and BIND.  3.15 Conﬁguring a Name Server to Forward  Some Queries to Other Name Servers  Problem You want a name server to forward queries for certain domain names to another name server.  Solution Use a zone statement of type forward to tell a BIND 8.2 or later or 9.1.0 or later name server to forward queries for domain names that end in the specified suffix to partic- ular name servers. For example:  zone "bar.example" {     type forward;     forwarders { 10.0.0.9; }; };  This tells the name server to forward queries for domain names that end in bar.example to the name server at 10.0.0.9.  Discussion As with the corresponding options substatement, you can list multiple forwarders in the forwarders substatement.  An alternative to using a forward zone is to use a stub zone. Stub zones are a little like slave zones, in that the name server periodically checks with its master server to see if the zone’s serial number has changed. But instead of transferring the whole zone, it retrieves just the zone’s SOA and NS records, plus any necessary glue A records, using discrete queries. That’s enough information to tell the name server where to begin iterative name resolution of domain names that end in the domain name of the stub zone. For example, here’s a stub zone definition very similar to the forward zone defined earlier:  zone "bar.example" {     type stub;     masters { 10.0.0.9; };     file "stub.bar.example"; };  3.15 Configuring a Name Server to Forward Some Queries to Other Name Servers    67  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Rather than sending a recursive query to the name server at 10.0.0.9 for information about any domain name that ends with bar.example, this name server would learn the bar.example NS records, and send one of those name servers a nonrecursive query for the domain name it needed. It would then follow any successive referrals to find the answer. This is less work for the name server at 10.0.0.9, but it also requires connectivity to any name server the local name server might be referred to.  See Also Contrast this with Recipe 3.14, which tells you how to configure a name server to forward all queries it can’t answer locally, and Recipe 3.16, which explains how to configure a name server not to forward certain queries. See “Forward Zones” in Chapter 10 of DNS and BIND for more information.  3.16 Conﬁguring a Name Server Not to Forward  Certain Queries  Problem You want to configure a name server not to forward queries for certain domain names.  Solution Use a null  empty  forwarders substatement to override forwarding for queries that would otherwise be forwarded. For example:  options {     directory " var named":     forwarders { 192.168.0.1; }; };  zone "foo.example" {     type master;     file "db.foo.example";     forwarders {}; };  Note the empty list of forwarders.  A null forwarders substatement will work in master, slave, and stub zones.  Discussion For primary master and slave zones, such as the primary master zone in the example above, it may not be obvious which queries the name server would forward. It’s  68    Chapter 3: BIND Name Server Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   authoritative for foo.example, after all, so why would it ever forward a query for a domain name in the zone?  The answer is that the null forwarders list applies not just to domain names in the zone, but to any domain names that end in the domain name of the zone. So in this example, the name server wouldn’t forward queries for domain names that ended in foo.example, even if those domain names were in delegated subdomains of foo.example. If you need to override forwarding for some domain names but don’t want to make the name server authoritative for the zone that has that domain name, use a stub zone, as described in Recipe 3.15. The name server will just get the zone’s SOA and NS records, and via discrete queries, not a zone transfer. There’s no way to disable forwarding without at least configuring a stub zone, though. For example, you can’t do this:  zone "foo.example" {     type forward;     forwarders {}; };  While this might turn off forwarding for domain names that end in foo.example, the name server won’t know how to resolve those domain names without at least the foo.example NS records.  See Also Recipes 3.14 and 3.15, and “Forward Zones” in Chapter 10 of DNS and BIND.  3.17 Returning Different Answers  to Different Queriers  Problem You want to configure a name server to return different answers to the same query depending on the IP address from which the query is sent.  Solution Use BIND 9’s view mechanism to create multiple versions of the zone that will con- tain the answer, and use the match-clients substatement to place the addresses of the queriers in the appropriate view.  For example, to have www.foo.example map to the address 192.168.0.10 for internal queries, and to the address 206.168.119.176 for queries from the Internet, create a db.foo.example.internal zone data file that includes this A record:  www.foo.example.    IN    A    192.168.0.10  3.17 Returning Different Answers to Different Queriers    69  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Then create a db.foo.example.external zone data file that includes this record:  www.foo.example.    IN    A    206.168.119.176  Define an access control list in named.conf to match internal IP addresses:  acl internal { 192.168 16; };  Then configure the two versions of the zone in two view statements:  view internal {      match-clients { internal; };      zone "foo.example" {         type master;         file "db.foo.example.internal";     };  view external {      match-clients { any; };      zone "foo.example" {         type master;         file "db.foo.example.external";     };  };  };  Discussion The first match-clients substatement that matches a querier’s address determines which view the querier sees, so queries from addresses that don’t match the internal ACL fall through to the external view and are answered from that version of foo.example.  The match-clients substatement defaults to any, so you can leave the substatement out of the external view entirely. However, subtlety is not always a virtue when writ- ing named.conf files, so you might want to use an explicit substatement, as I did here, to make the configuration that much easier to grok.  See Also If you want the name server to return the same answer, but with the records in a dif- ferent order, see Recipe 3.18. If you need to set up a slave name server for zones in multiple views on your primary master—and you have my sympathy—brace yourself, then read Recipe 3.19. For more information on views, see “Views” in Chapter 10 of DNS and BIND.  70    Chapter 3: BIND Name Server Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   3.18 Determining the Order in Which a Name  Server Returns Answers  Problem You want a name server to return certain answers in a particular order.  Solution Use the rrset-order options substatement in BIND 8 or BIND 9.3.0 and later.  In BIND 8, rrset-order lets you choose to give out answers that include multiple resource records in one of three orders:  The default, often referred to as round robin. The order in which records are returned is rotated between responses, with the first record given out in the pre- vious answer moved to the end in the next answer.  Records are always returned in the same order.  Records are returned in a random order.  rrset-order also lets you select the particular answers an order applies to using three qualifiers:  The order only applies to answers to queries for the specified domain name, which may include a wildcard as its leftmost label. The default is “*”.  The order only applies to answers to queries in the specified class, which defaults to IN.  The order only applies to queries for the specified type of record. The default is ANY, or any type of record.  cyclic  fixed  random  name  class  type  The default behavior, then, is equivalent to:  options     rrset-order {         name "*" class IN type ANY order cyclic;     }; };  3.18 Determining the Order in Which a Name Server Returns Answers    71  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   So, to return the A records of your web server in a fixed order, you might use:  options {     rrset-order {         name "www.foo.example" type A order fixed;     }; };  You’d want to make sure that www.foo.example’s A records appeared in the correct order in the foo.example zone data file, of course.  Versions of BIND from 9.3.0 on support just the cyclic and random orders.  Discussion BIND 9 doesn’t support true round robin, in which the name server tracks the order in which it gives out the records in an answer. Instead, it randomly chooses a start- ing point in the list of records and then places the remaining records into the response as though the first record had rotated to the beginning. For example, say www.foo.example had the following three A records:  A BIND 9 name server might choose the third A record as the starting point, and then would insert the next two A records  10.0.0.3 and 10.0.0.1  to produce a response in the following order:  www.foo.example.    IN    A    10.0.0.1                     IN    A    10.0.0.2                     IN    A    10.0.0.3  www.foo.example.    IN    A    10.0.0.3                     IN    A    10.0.0.1                     IN    A    10.0.0.2  If what you want to do is sort addresses on certain networks to the front of responses, you need to configure the sortlist. See Recipe 3.28.  See Also Recipe 2.7 for setting up round robin and “The rrset-order Substatement” in Chap- ter 10 of DNS and BIND for more information on rrset-order.  3.19 Setting Up a Slave Name Server for a Zone  in Multiple Views  Problem You want to configure a BIND 9 name server as a slave for a zone that exists in mul- tiple views on the master name server.  72    Chapter 3: BIND Name Server Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Solution Configure the slave name server to initiate the transfers of the zone from different source IP addresses, one for each of the views of the zone. Then configure the master name server to make a different view of the zone visible to each of the slave’s source addresses.  For example, say the master name server loads two views of the zone foo.example:  options {     directory " var named"; };  acl internal { 192.168 16; };  view internal {      match-clients { internal; };      zone "foo.example" {         type master;         file "internal db.foo.example";     };  view external {      match-clients { any; };       match all other IP addresses      zone "foo.example" {         type master;         file "external db.foo.example";     };  };  };  If the slave name server has the IP address 192.168.1.1, it would normally only see— and only be able to transfer—the internal version of foo.example.  If you add an IP address alias  say, 192.168.1.2  to the slave’s network interface, though, you can reconfigure the master to place that one IP address in the external view. Here’s how the configuration of the slave might look:  options {     directory " var named"; };  acl internal { 192.168 16; };  view internal {      match-clients { internal; };  3.19 Setting Up a Slave Name Server for a Zone in Multiple Views    73  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Here’s how the primary master’s named.conf file might look, after changing the con- figuration to place the slave’s new address in the external view:      zone "foo.example" {         type slave;         masters { 192.168.0.1; };         file "internal bak.foo.example";         transfer-source 192.168.1.1;     };  view external {      match-clients { any; };      zone "foo.example" {         type slave;         masters { 192.168.0.1; };         file "external bak.foo.example";         transfer-source 192.168.1.2;     };  options {     directory " var named"; };  acl internal { ! 192.168.1.2; 192.168 16; };  view internal {      match-clients { internal; };      zone "foo.example" {         type master;         file "internal db.foo.example";     };  };  };  };  };  view external {      match-clients { any; };       match all other IP addresses      zone "foo.example" {         type master;         file "external db.foo.example";     };  74    Chapter 3: BIND Name Server Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   There are still minor problems with this configuration as written—NOTIFY doesn’t work. When the primary master name server sends NOTIFY messages to the slave, the slave interprets those NOTIFY messages according to the view the source address of the message is in. Since the primary master’s address is in the slave’s internal view, the slave assumes all NOTIFY messages refer to the internal copy of foo.example. Also, the primary will look up the addresses of the slave to send it NOTIFY messages. If the pri- mary’s address is in its own internal view, it’ll only find the slave’s internal address. To solve this, the master needs two addresses, too: one from which it can look up the slave’s internal address and send NOTIFY messages about the internal view, and one from which it can look up the slave’s external address and send NOTIFY messages about the external view. And, of course, both the primary master and the slave need to consider the primary’s extra address part of its external view. So the primary mas- ter’s configuration ends up looking like this:     Primary master; has IP addresses 192.168.0.1 and 192.168.0.2  options {     directory " var named"; };  view internal {      match-clients { internal; };  acl internal { !192.168.0.2; ! 192.168.1.2; 192.168 16; };      query-source address 192.168.0.1;       so it sees slave's internal addr      zone "foo.example" {         type master;         file "internal db.foo.example";         notify-source 192.168.0.1;          so the NOTIFY falls into the                                             slave's internal view     };  view external {      match-clients { any; };                match all other IP addresses      query-source address 192.168.0.2;      so it sees slave's external addr      zone "foo.example" {         type master;         file "external db.foo.example";         notify-source 192.168.0.2;         so the NOTIFY falls into the                                            slave's external view     };  };  };  3.19 Setting Up a Slave Name Server for a Zone in Multiple Views    75  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   And the slave’s configuration looks like this:     Slave; has IP addresses 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.1.2  options {     directory " var named"; };  view internal {      match-clients { internal; };  acl internal { !192.168.0.2; !192.168.1.2; 192.168 16; };      query-source address 192.168.1.1;       so it sees internal addrs      zone "foo.example" {         type slave;         masters { 192.168.0.1; };         file "internal bak.foo.example";         transfer-source 192.168.1.1;        so it gets the internal view     };  view external {      match-clients { any; };      query-source address 192.168.1.2;       so it sees external addrs      zone "foo.example" {         type slave;         masters { 192.168.0.1; };         file "external bak.foo.example";         transfer-source 192.168.1.2;        so it gets the external view     };  };  };  Discussion Notice that the negation of the new IP address of the slave name server in the defini- tion of the internal access control list causes queries from that address—including zone transfer requests—to fall through to the external view.  See Also Recipe 3.17 for setting up multiple views on a primary master name server.  76    Chapter 3: BIND Name Server Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Solution Use the recursion options substatement:  options {     directory " var named";     recursion no; };  Discussion Disabling recursion is one of the most effective ways to limit the amount of memory a name server uses. Processing a recursive query often requires a name server to query another name server, and the name server then caches the response. It’s cach- ing that causes a name server’s memory usage to increase over time; without cach- ing, a name server tends to use the same amount of memory. If a name server treats all queries as nonrecursive, it won’t query other name servers and hence won’t cache.  Unfortunately, you can’t disable recursion on just any old name server. Many name servers serve one or more authorized resolvers, and those resolvers need their recur- sive queries answered, well, recursively. Name servers used as forwarders must pro- cess recursive queries, too. If you want to limit memory utilization on a name server that needs to process recursive queries, see Recipe 3.21.  See Also Recipe 3.21, for information on limiting how much memory a name server uses, and “A Nonrecursive Name Server” in Chapter 10 of DNS and BIND.  3.21 Limiting the Memory a Name Server Uses  Problem You want to limit the amount of memory a name server uses.  3.21 Limiting the Memory a Name Server Uses    77  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Solution Use the max-cache-size options substatement:  options {     directory " var named";     max-cache-size 10m;         maximum cache size of 10MB };  This tells the name server to remove old, cached records early  i.e., before they’re stale  if the size of the cache reaches the limit. If you set this, you may also want to reduce the cleaning interval  the period at which the name server checks for stale records :  options {     directory " var named";     max-cache-size 10m;         maximum cache size of 10MB     cleaning-interval 15;       clean cache every 15 minutes };  You may also find the max-cache-ttl and max-ncache-ttl options substatements handy. These limit the time-to-live values of cached records and cached negative responses, respectively. For example:  options {     directory " var named";     max-cache-size 10m;         maximum cache size of 10MB     cleaning-interval 15;       clean cache every 15 minutes     max-cache-ttl 60;           limit cached record to a 60s TTL     max-ncache-ttl 60;          limit cache neg. resp. to a 60s TTL };  Discussion The minimum maximum cache size  that is, the smallest you can set the limit  is two megabytes.  max-cache-size isn’t supported until BIND 9.2.0, while max-cache-ttl is supported as far back as 9.0.0. max-ncache-ttl, believe it or not, is supported in BIND 8.2 and later.  It was introduced when BIND name servers began caching negative responses according to the enclosing zone’s SOA record, as a safeguard against unintentionally long TTLs.   Whatever you do, don’t set max-cache-ttl to zero. If you do, the name server will let useful records expire  the NS records it receives in referrals, say  before it uses them, and you’ll see SERVFAIL responses for domain names in zones outside the name server’s authority.  Some administrators are tempted to use the datasize options substatement to limit the size of the data segment the named process uses. Unfortunately, when named reaches the datasize limit, it exits. And then, of course, you have no name server run- ning at all—though I guess that minimizes its memory utilization.  78    Chapter 3: BIND Name Server Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Solution On a BIND 9 name server, you don’t need any special configuration: BIND 9 slave name servers request IXFRs by default, and BIND 9 masters automatically create and maintain the journal files they need to respond to IXFR requests.  On BIND 8, however, you need to tell slave name servers to request an IXFR from a particular master in a server statement:  You also need to configure the master to track changes to zones so it can respond to IXFR requests:  server 192.168.0.1 {     support-ixfr yes; };  options {     directory " var named";     maintain-ixfr-base yes; };  Discussion Remember that IXFR only works with dynamically updated zones: the only changes that are logged in the master’s journal are those made using dynamic updates. If you manually edit a zone data file, the changes won’t make it into the journal. Moreover, a BIND 9 name server won’t load a zone that’s been edited by hand because it doesn’t have the record of the latest change.  See Also Recipe 3.23 to limit the size of the BIND 8 IXFR log file, Recipe 2.15 for instructions on making manual changes to a dynamically updated zone, and “Incremental Zone Transfer  IXFR ” in Chapter 10 of DNS and BIND.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  3.22 Configuring IXFR    79   3.23 Limiting the Size of the IXFR Log File  Problem You want to limit the size of the incremental zone transfer  IXFR  log file.  Solution Use the BIND 8 max-ixfr-log-size options substatement. For example, to limit the size of the IXFR log file to 100K, you’d use:  options {     directory " var named";     maintain-ixfr-base yes;     max-ixfr-log-size 100k; };  Discussion Without a configured maximum size for the IXFR log file, a BIND 8 name server will trim the log once it exceeds 50% of the size of the corresponding zone data file. If your chosen maximum is higher than 50% of the size of the zone data file, your max- imum will supersede the built-in limit.  Though it’s documented earlier, max-ixfr-log-size doesn’t work until BIND 8.2.1.  You won’t need to do this at all with a BIND 9 name server.  In fact, BIND 9 name servers don’t understand max-ixfr-log-size, so there’s no point in trying.  A BIND 9 name server will automatically trim its journal file. Like the sticker says, “No user serviceable parts inside.”  See Also Recipe 3.22 for configuring IXFR on BIND 8 name servers and “Incremental Zone Transfer  IXFR ” in Chapter 10 of DNS and BIND.  3.24 Conﬁguring a Name Server to Listen Only  on Certain Network Interfaces  Problem You want to configure a name server so that it listens only on some of the host’s net- work interfaces.  80    Chapter 3: BIND Name Server Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Solution Use the listen-on options substatement:  options {     directory " var named";     listen-on { 192.168.0.1; }; };  The name server will only listen on network interfaces that match the address match list. You can specify several addresses; for example, you probably want the name server to listen on the loopback interface:  options {     directory " var named";     listen-on { 192.168.0.1; 127.0.0.1; }; };  Discussion The listen-on substatement can come in handy if you’re running a name server on a host with lots of IP address aliases. You probably aren’t going to configure resolvers to query all of those addresses, or delegate zones to all of them. Just pick one and tell the name server to listen only on that address.  You can also tell the name server not to listen on a particular interface by using an address match list with a negated element:  options {     directory " var named";     listen-on { ! 192.168.0.254; }; };  See Also Recipe 7.2, to learn how to configure a name server to send queries from a particular IP address, and “Configuring the IPv4 Transport” in Chapter 10 of DNS and BIND.  3.25 Running a Name Server on an Alternate Port  Problem You want to run a name server on a port other than 53.  3.25 Running a Name Server on an Alternate Port    81  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Solution Use the listen-on options substatement. For example:  options {     directory " var named";     listen-on port 1053 { any; }; };  If this is a master name server for one or more zones, you can specify the port on which the master is running in your slaves’ masters substatements. A zone statement on the slave might look like this:  zone "foo.example" {     type slave;     masters port 1053 { 192.168.0.1; };     file "bak.foo.example"; };  Discussion This configuration requires some explaining. What’s the use of running a name server on an alternate port?  The most common reason is to test a name server’s configuration. You can configure a name server to listen on a high-numbered port, even start it without root privilege, and use dig’s –p option  to specify the port number  or nslookup’s set port command  same thing  to make sure it responds the way you expect.  You might also be running firewall software that does port translation, so that you can translate incoming queries sent to port 53 to whichever port you choose. Or you might just want to run several named processes on the same host, acting as master name servers for different versions of the same zone. Of course, you can also use BIND 9’s views feature for that, with less overhead.  Specified before the list of master name servers, the port applies to all masters. Some- times that isn’t what you want, because not all of your masters run on an alternate port. If that’s the case, BIND 9 name servers support an alternate form:  zone "foo.example" {     type slave;     masters { 192.168.0.1 port 1053; 192.168.1.1; };     file "bak.foo.example"; };  See Also “Configuring the IPv4 Transport” in Chapter 10 of DNS and BIND.  82    Chapter 3: BIND Name Server Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   3.26 Setting Up a Root Name Server  Problem You want to set up your own root name server.  Solution Create a data file for the root zone. The data file needs an SOA record for the root zone and NS records for all of your root name servers. For example:  $TTL 86400 .    IN    SOA    ns1.corp.example. hostmaster.corp.example.           2002042600 1h 15m 30d 1h        IN    NS    ns1.corp.example.      IN    NS    ns2.corp.example.  You’ll probably also need to add delegation to the zones at the “top” of your namespace. For example, if most of your internal domain names end in corp.example, you’d add NS records delegating corp.example to the right name servers:  corp.example.    IN    NS    ns3.corp.example. corp.example.    IN    NS    ns4.corp.example.  All of these name servers will require glue A records, too:  ns1.corp.example.    IN    A    10.0.0.1 ns2.corp.example.    IN    A    10.1.0.1 ns3.corp.example.    IN    A    10.2.0.1 ns4.corp.example.    IN    A    10.3.0.1  Don’t forget to delegate the reverse-mapping zones that correspond to your networks:  10.in-addr.arpa.    IN    NS    ns3.corp.example. 10.in-addr.arpa.    IN    NS    ns4.corp.example.  Then add a new zone statement to the name server’s named.conf file to tell it to load the root zone’s data file:  You can create slave root name servers, too, by adding a zone statement like this to their named.conf files:  zone "." {     type master;     file "db.root"; };  zone "." {     type slave;     masters { 10.0.0.1; };     file "bak.root"; };  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  3.26 Setting Up a Root Name Server    83   Finally, you should replace the root hints file on your non-root name servers with one that lists your new, internal roots:  .    IN    NS    ns1.corp.example.      IN    NS    ns2.corp.example.  ns1.corp.example.    IN    A    10.0.0.1 ns2.corp.example.    IN    A    10.1.0.1  Discussion Moving to a DNS architecture that uses internal root name servers is a big decision, with implications far beyond what I can cover here. For example, with an internal root architecture, you can’t resolve Internet domain names. Make sure you know what you’re doing.  See Also “DNS and Internet Firewalls” in Chapter 11 of DNS and BIND.  3.27 Returning a Default Record  Problem You want a name server to return the same record regardless of the domain name looked up.  Solution Occasionally, administrators want to set up a name server that maps every domain name to the same IP address. To do that, configure the name server as a root name server, add an A record to the wildcard domain name in the root zone and omit any delegation. For example, the root zone might look like this:  $TTL 86400 .    IN    SOA    default-ns.corp.example. hostmaster.corp.example.           2002042600 1h 15m 30d 1h        IN    NS    default-ns.corp.example.  default-ns.corp.example.    IN    A    10.0.0.1  *.    IN    A    10.0.0.10  84    Chapter 3: BIND Name Server Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Discussion Most administrators probably take one look at this configuration and think, “Why in the world would I ever need a name server like that?” But for some applications, this kind of name server can come in handy. Think of those in-room, high-speed Internet access services that hotels offer: after you connect and get an IP address via DHCP, you reach the service’s web site regardless of the URL you type in. This kind of name server could make up part of that solution.  One minor thing to note: BIND 8 and BIND 9 name servers treat wildcard domain names differently. On a BIND 9 name server, the wildcard in the zone above would match all domain names except default-ns.corp.example and domain names that end in that string. On a BIND 8 name server, the wildcard wouldn’t match domain names that end in example. You’d need to add another A record to a different wildcard domain name to match those domain names:  *.example.    IN    A    10.0.0.10  See Also Recipe 3.26 for instructions on setting up a root name server, and “Internal Roots” in Chapter 11 and “Wildcards” in Chapter 16 of DNS and BIND.  3.28 Conﬁguring DNS to Let Clients  Find the Closest Server  Problem You want to set up DNS so that your clients  e.g., FTP NFS or NTP clients  can find the server closest to them.  Solution If you don’t have many servers, and it’s relatively easy to determine which server is closest to a client given that client’s address, use the sortlist options substatement. This allows you to configure a sortlist: a set of rules that determine, based on the address from which a query is received, which A records to return first in the response to that query.  Say, for example, that you have three networks: 192.168.0 24, 192.168.1 24, and 192.168.2 24. For clients on 192.168.0 24, servers on 192.168.0 24 are—fairly obvi- ously—closest. The next closest servers are those on 192.168.1 24. For clients on 192.168.1 24, again, servers on the same network, 192.168.1 24, are closest, followed  3.28 Configuring DNS to Let Clients Find the Closest Server    85  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   by servers on 192.168.0 24. Finally, for clients on 192.168.2 24, servers on the same network are closest, but servers on 192.168.0 24 and 192.168.1 24 are equally close.  A sortlist substatement that would return the A record of the closest server first would look like this:  options {     directory " var named";     sortlist {         { 192.168.0 24; { 192.168.0 24; 192.168.1 24; 192.168.2 24; }; };         { 192.168.1 24; { 192.168.1 24; 192.168.0 24; 192.168.2 24; }; };         { 192.168.2 24; { 192.168.2 24; { 192.168.0 24; 192.168.1 24; };  }; };     }; };  Though this seems hairy, it’s not quite as awful as it looks. The sortlist is an address match list—just a complicated one. Each term in this sortlist is a pair of address match lists. The first element  192.168.0 24 in the first pair  matches the addresses of some queriers. The name server sorts A records in response to those queriers so that the records appear in the order specified in the second element. For the first pair, that’s:  { 192.168.0 24; 192.168.1 24; 192.168.2 24; };  Or, A records on 192.168.0 24 first, followed by A records on 192.168.1 24, fol- lowed by A records on 192.168.2 24, followed by all other A records. If two net- works are equally preferred, they’re nested further, as in the last pair.  If you have roughly as many servers as you have zones, and each zone has a preferred server, you can take advantage of your resolvers’ search lists to let clients find the clos- est server. For example, say you’d like your NTP clients to find their closest NTP server automatically. You can create an alias, ntp. , that always points to the domain name of the closest NTP server for that zone. For example:  ntp.denver.corp.example.    IN    CNAME    tick.boulder.corp.example.  Then configure the NTP clients on the Denver site  which are presumably in the denver.corp.example zone  to use the NTP server named just ntp. As long as the search list on the hosts the NTP clients run on begins with denver.corp.example, they’ll use ntp.denver.corp.example as their NTP server.  Discussion The sortlist substatement is supported in all versions of BIND from 8.2 on, and in BIND 9 from BIND 9.1.0 on.  Sortlists can also have a simpler form, too, with single terms rather than pairs. For example:  options {     directory " var named";     sortlist {         { 192.168.0 24; };  86    Chapter 3: BIND Name Server Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.           { 192.168.1 24; };         { 192.168.2 24; };     }; };  In this form, the name server will sort answers to queries received from 192.168.0  24, for example, so that A records on 192.168.0 24 are first, and similarly for the other two networks.  You can mix the two forms if you like, but be careful, because it’s easy to leave out a curly brace  “{“ or “}”  .  See Also Recipe 2.3 for how to create an alias, and Recipes 9.2 and 9.3 for how to configure a resolver’s search list.  3.29 Handling Dialup Connections  Problem You’re running an authoritative name server behind a dial-on-demand connection.  Solution Designate the name server’s zones as dialup zones using the dialup substatement:  options {     directory " var named";     dialup yes; };  This tells the name server to concentrate zone maintenance activity into a short period, and to perform that maintenance once each heartbeat interval. The default heartbeat interval is one hour. For a slave zone, the name server will refresh once, at most, during each heartbeat interval, even if the zone’s refresh interval is shorter. For a master zone, the name server will send NOTIFY messages to all slaves when the zone changes, triggering a dialup and a successive zone transfer.  Discussion To adjust the heartbeat interval, use the heartbeat-interval options substatement. For example:  options {     directory " var named";     heartbeat-interval 180;       3 hours };  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  3.29 Handling Dialup Connections    87   You can also use dialup as a zone substatement, in which case it suppresses zone maintenance traffic for just that zone. This may be useful on a name server that has dedicated connectivity to the Internet, but has a slave or master at the far end of a dialup connection.

Post- cards from relatives on vacation, greeting cards, the odd misdirected credit card offer—it didn’t matter. I’ll bet that if you think back far enough, you can remember a time when it was exciting to get Internet email, too.  Now, of course, most Internet email is spam, but we can dream of a simpler time, before the Nigerian email scam and ordering Viagra on the Internet.  One of the linchpins of getting all of that email into your inbox is DNS. Mail trans- port agents all over the Internet look up MX records attached to your domain names to determine where to deliver your mail. I showed you the basic syntax of the MX record back in Recipe 2.4, but you also can craft those MX records to designate backup mail servers  Recipe 4.1 , multiple, equivalent mail servers  Recipe 4.2 , and more. This chapter will show you how.  4.1  Conﬁguring a Backup Mail Server in DNS  Problem You want to configure a backup mail server for a mail destination.  Solution Add an MX record for the mail destination, listing the domain name of the backup mail server at a higher preference value  and therefore lower preference  than the main mail server. For example, say the MX record for the mail destination foo.example, cur- rently looks like this:  foo.example.    IN    MX    10 mail.foo.example.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  89   To add smtp.isp.net as a backup mail server for foo.example, add another MX record to foo.example pointing to that mail server, with a preference value higher than 10. For example:  foo.example.    IN    MX    20 smtp.isp.net.  Discussion By default, most modern mail software won’t accept mail addressed to just any old domain name. You may need to configure the backup mail server to accept mail addressed to the mail destination. But don’t configure the mail destination as local to the mail server; the backup mail server should accept the mail but queue it for later delivery to your main mail server.  See Also Recipe 2.4 for instructions on setting up a mail destination and “MX Records” in Chapter 5 of DNS and BIND.  4.2  Conﬁguring Multiple Mail Servers in DNS  Problem You want to configure DNS so that mail addressed to a destination will be sent to one of a number of equivalent mail servers.  Solution Add MX records for the domain name of the mail destination, pointing to the domain names of the mail servers, all at the same—and lowest—preference value. For example:  foo.example.    IN    MX    10 smtp1.foo.example. foo.example.    IN    MX    10 smtp2.foo.example. foo.example.    IN    MX    10 smtp3.foo.example.  Discussion Most modern mail servers that have mail to send to a destination will choose ran- domly among mail servers with the same preference value. All of these mail servers are the “final destination” for the mail, as far as DNS is concerned, so all should be configured to see the mail destination as local.  If one of the mail servers fails, a mail server trying to send mail to the destination will simply try another of the mail servers.  90    Chapter 4: Electronic Mail  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Using multiple “main” mail servers doesn’t preclude your listing one or more backup mail servers, too. Just add MX records pointing to the destination’s backup mail servers, with higher preference values than the value you used for the main mail serv- ers. For example:  foo.example.    IN    MX    10 smtp1.foo.example. foo.example.    IN    MX    10 smtp2.foo.example. foo.example.    IN    MX    10 smtp3.foo.example. foo.example.    IN    MX    20 backup.isp.net.  Mail servers sending mail to the destination will only try the backup mail server if they fail to deliver the mail to all more-preferred mail servers.  See Also Recipe 2.4 for instructions on setting up a mail destination and Recipe 4.1 for desig- nating backup mail servers for a destination, as well as “MX Records” in Chapter 5 of DNS and BIND.  4.3  Conﬁguring Mail to Go to One Server and the Web to Another  Problem You want mail addressed to a particular domain name to be routed to one mail server, while users specifying that domain name in a URL reach a web server on a different host.  Solution Since mail servers sending mail to a particular domain name mail destination prefer- entially use MX records for that domain name, add an MX record to that domain name pointing to the mail server. Web browsers, on the other hand, only look up A records, so attach an A record to the domain name pointing to the address of the web server. For example:  foo.example.    IN    MX    10 mail.foo.example. foo.example.    IN    A    192.168.0.100  Discussion This is less a recipe than a reminder that a single domain name can serve multiple purposes: it can represent a mail destination when it appears on the right side of an email address. It can represent a web site when it appears in a URL. Since some of  4.3 Configuring Mail to Go to One Server and the Web to Another    91  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   these services look up different types of records, you simply attach multiple record types to a single domain name to accommodate them.  See Also Recipes 2.4 and 2.5.  4.4  Conﬁguring DNS for “Virtual” Email Addresses  Problem You want to add a new “virtual” mail destination to DNS.  Solution Add an MX record to the appropriate zone with the domain name of the mail desti- nation as the owner name and the domain name of the mail server for that destina- tion on the right side. For example, to route mail addressed to user@bar.example to mail.foo.example, you could add this MX record to the bar.example zone:  bar.example.    IN    MX    10 mail.foo.example.  Discussion There’s really nothing virtual about the mail destination bar.example from a DNS perspective—hence the quotation marks. bar.example is a legitimate domain name in a real zone that happens to own an MX record, so it’s usable as a mail destination.  Note that the MX record must be added to the correct zone. If you want to direct mail addressed to bar.example to a particular mail server, you must add the MX record to the bar.example zone data file. It won’t do anyone any good in the foo.example zone data file: it’ll be ignored as out-of-zone data.  mail.foo.example will probably need to be configured to understand that bar.example is a local mail destination. Then it’s up to the mail server on mail.foo.example to decide what to do with mail addressed to individual users at bar.example. This might be handled by an aliases file or a virtual user table.  See Also Recipe 2.4.  92    Chapter 4: Electronic Mail  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   4.5  Conﬁguring DNS So a Mail Server and the Email It Sends Pass Anti-Spam Tests  Problem You want to make sure a mail server and the email it sends pass all DNS-related anti- spam tests.  Solution First, make sure that any domain names used in return addresses resolve to an MX record or an A record. For example, if the mail server sends out all mail addressed from user@foo.example, make sure foo.example owns at least an MX record:  foo.example.    IN    MX    10 mail.foo.example.  Next, make sure that the IP address that the mail server sends mail from reverse- maps to a domain name  that is, that the domain name in in-addr.arpa that corre- sponds to the address has a PTR record attached :  2.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa.    IN    PTR    mail.foo.example.  Check that the domain name that the mail server’s address maps to in turn maps back to that address  that is, the domain name has an A record with the same address on the right side :  mail.foo.example.    IN    A    192.168.0.2  Finally, check that the domain name your mail software uses in the HELO or EHLO  extended HELLO  SMTP commands is either the same as the domain name you just checked  mail.foo.example , or else passes the same forward- and reverse-mapping checks. For example, if your mail server announces itself as smtp.foo.example, make sure smtp.foo.example maps to an address, and that address maps back to smtp.foo.example.  Discussion Not all mail software performs all of these checks when receiving email, but ensur- ing that a mail server passes them will help guarantee that the mail it sends won’t be refused as spam by the stricter mail servers on the Internet.

All rights reserved.   CHAPTER 5 Chapter 5 BIND Name Server Operations  Introduction  5.0 Creating zone data and configuring a name server is only the beginning. Managing a name server over time requires an understanding of how to control it and which commands it supports. It takes familiarity with other tools from the BIND distribu- tion, including nsupdate, used to send dynamic updates to a name server.  This chapter includes lots of recipes that involve ndc and rndc, programs that send con- trol messages to BIND 8 and 9 name servers, respectively. These programs let an admin- istrator reload modified zones, refresh slave zones, flush the cache, and much more. The list of commands the name server supports seems to grow with each successive release of BIND, so I’ve provided a peek at a few new commands in BIND 9.3.0 for the curious.  Several recipes describe how to drive the nsupdate program to send dynamic updates. In the brave new world of dynamic zones, an administrator may have to make most of the changes to zone data using dynamic update, rather than by manually editing zone data files. The recipes cover sending plain vanilla dynamic updates  Recipe 5.19 , set- ting prerequisites in a dynamic update  Recipe 5.21 , and sending TSIG-signed dynamic updates  Recipe 5.22 .  Finally, the chapter covers a few common administrative processes, such as setting up and failing over to a backup master name server, migrating from one domain name to another, and measuring a name server’s performance.  5.1  Figuring Out How Much Memory a Name Server Will Need  Problem You need to figure out how much memory a name server will require.  94  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Solution While this answer may seem like a cop-out, the only sure-fire way to determine how much memory a name server will need is to configure it, start it, and then monitor it using a tool like top. After a week or so, the size of the named process should stabi- lize, and you’ll know how much memory it needs.  Discussion The reason it’s so difficult to calculate how much memory a name server requires is that there are so many variables involved. The size of the named executable varies on differ- ent operating systems and hardware architectures. Zones have a unique mix of records. Zone data files may use lots of shortcuts  e.g., leaving out the origin, or even using a $GENERATE control statement  or none at all. The resolvers that use the name server may send a huge volume of queries, causing the name server’s cache to swell, or may send just sporadic queries.  See Also The BIND 9 ARM, section 2.3.  5.2  Testing a Name Server’s Conﬁguration  Problem You want to test a name server’s configuration before putting it into production.  Solution Use the named-checkconf and named-checkzone programs to check the named.conf file and zone data files, respectively. named-checkconf reads  etc named.conf by default, so if you haven’t moved the configuration file into  etc yet, specify the path- name to the configuration file you want to test as the argument:  $ named-checkconf ~ test named.conf  named-checkconf uses the routines in BIND  BIND 9.1.0 and later, to be exact  to make sure the named.conf file is syntactically correct. If there are any syntactic or semantic errors in named.conf, named-checkconf will print an error. For example:  $ named-checkconf  tmp named.conf  tmp named.conf:3: missing ';' before '}'  named-checkzone uses BIND’s own routines to check the syntax of a zone data file. To run it, specify the domain name of the zone and the name of the zone data file as arguments:  $ named-checkzone foo.example db.foo.example  5.2 Testing a Name Server’s Configuration    95  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   If the zone contains any errors, named-checkzone prints an error. If the zone would load without errors, named-checkzone prints a message like this:  zone foo.example IN: loaded serial 2002022400 OK  Once you’ve checked the configuration file and zone data, configure the name server to listen on a nonstandard port with the listen-on options substatement, and not to use a control channel:  controls { };  options {     directory " var named";     listen-on port 1053 { any; }; };  That way, the test name server won’t interfere with any production name server you might already have running. Check the name server’s syslog output  which should be clean, if you ran named-checkconf and named-checkzone  and query the name server with dig or another query tool, specifying the alternate port:  $ dig –p 1053 soa foo.example.  Once you’re satisfied with the name server’s responses to a few queries, you can remove the listen-on substatement, add a real controls statement and put it into production.  Discussion Even though named-checkconf and named-checkzone first shipped with BIND 9.1.0, BIND 8’s configuration syntax is similar enough to BIND 9’s that you can easily use named-checkconf with a BIND 8 named.conf file. The zone data file format is exactly the same between versions, so you can use named-checkzone, too.  See Also Recipe 3.25, for more information on running a name server on an alternate port.  5.3  Viewing a Name Server’s Cache  Problem You want to view a name server’s cached data.  Solution Use rndc dumpdb  BIND 9  or ndc dumpdb  BIND 8  to dump the cache to disk, then look through the dump file.  96    Chapter 5: BIND Name Server Operations  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Discussion BIND 9 name servers only dump the contents of the cache to disk by default, but BIND 8 name servers dump both the contents of cache and authoritative zone data to disk, so you’ll have to find the cached records in the file.  To determine which records in a BIND 8 database dump were cached, look at the TTLs and the contents of the comment field. Authoritative zone data will have the nice, round TTLs you configured, while cached records will have had their TTLs decre- mented by the number of seconds they’ve been in the cache. Cached records will also have “Cr=” as a comment at the end of the record, giving the credibility level of the record  an indication of the quality of the cached record . For example, these records were cached from an authoritative response from the name server at 128.9.0.107:  .       518380  IN      NS      I.ROOT-SERVERS.NET.     ;Cr=auth [128.9.0.107]         518380  IN      NS      E.ROOT-SERVERS.NET.     ;Cr=auth [128.9.0.107]         518380  IN      NS      D.ROOT-SERVERS.NET.     ;Cr=auth [128.9.0.107]         518380  IN      NS      A.ROOT-SERVERS.NET.     ;Cr=auth [128.9.0.107]         518380  IN      NS      H.ROOT-SERVERS.NET.     ;Cr=auth [128.9.0.107]         518380  IN      NS      C.ROOT-SERVERS.NET.     ;Cr=auth [128.9.0.107]         518380  IN      NS      G.ROOT-SERVERS.NET.     ;Cr=auth [128.9.0.107]         518380  IN      NS      F.ROOT-SERVERS.NET.     ;Cr=auth [128.9.0.107]         518380  IN      NS      B.ROOT-SERVERS.NET.     ;Cr=auth [128.9.0.107]         518380  IN      NS      J.ROOT-SERVERS.NET.     ;Cr=auth [128.9.0.107]         518380  IN      NS      K.ROOT-SERVERS.NET.     ;Cr=auth [128.9.0.107]         518380  IN      NS      L.ROOT-SERVERS.NET.     ;Cr=auth [128.9.0.107]         518380  IN      NS      M.ROOT-SERVERS.NET.     ;Cr=auth [128.9.0.107]  Remember that dumping the cache to disk has no effect on the contents of the cache. If you want to flush  clear  the cache, see Recipe 5.4.  See Also Recipe 5.4 and “Controlling the Name Server” in Chapter 7 of DNS and BIND.  5.4  Flushing  Clearing  a Name Server’s Cache  Problem You want to flush bad records from a name server’s cache.  Solution If you run a BIND 9.2.0 or newer name server, you can flush the cache with rndc flush. With older name servers, you need to kill the name server and restart it to flush the cache. You can do that in one fell swoop with rndc restart or ndc exec.  5.4 Flushing  Clearing  a Name Server’s Cache    97  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Discussion Clearing the cache is really a side effect of killing the name server, since BIND name servers only store cached data in memory. Since restarting the name server takes time, especially if the name server is authoritative for many zones, rndc flush is a bet- ter option.  If you run multiple views on your BIND 9.2.0 or newer name server, you can flush the cache in only one view using rndc flush viewname. For example:  BIND 9.3.0 will support flushing all of the records attached to a particular domain name with rndc flushname. For example:   rndc flush internal   rndc flushname cnn.com  See Also Recipe 5.9 for restarting a name server with the same command-line options.  5.5 Modifying Zone Data Without Restarting  the Name Server  Problem You want to modify your zone data without restarting the name server.  Solution Make the change to the zone data file. For BIND 9, run:   rndc reload domain-name-of-zone  For BIND 8, run:   ndc reload domain-name-of-zone  If you’ve modified multiple zones, just list them after reload. For example:   rndc reload foo.example bar.example  Discussion Remember to increment the serial number in your zone’s SOA record after changing the zone data. The primary master reloads the zone regardless of whether you’ve incremented the serial number, since the file’s modification time has changed, but your zone’s slaves only have the serial number to tell them whether the zone has been updated.  98    Chapter 5: BIND Name Server Operations  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Reloading individual zones, as shown above, was introduced in BIND 8.2.1 and again in 9.1.0. With older versions of BIND, just use rndc reload or ndc reload, as appropriate. That takes a little more time, since the name server checks all zone data files to see which have changed.  If you’re reloading a zone that exists in multiple views on a BIND 9 name server, specify the view with rndc reload domain-name-of-zone class view. For example:   rndc reload foo.example in external  Unfortunately, you can’t leave out the class, even though you’re unlikely ever to reload a non-Internet class zone.  Telling a BIND 9 name server to reload a dynamically updated zone has no effect, since the name server doesn’t expect you to update the zone manually. Telling a BIND 8 name server to reload a dynamically updated zone may work—or you may lose your manual changes. See Recipe 2.15 for instructions on how to make manual changes to a dynamically updated zone.  Dynamic update is, of course, another way to update zone data without restarting the name server; see Recipe 5.19 for details.  See Also Recipe 2.15, for making manual changes to a dynamically updated zone; Recipe 5.7, for manually initiating a zone transfer on a slave; Recipe 5.19 for modifying a zone using dynamic update; and “Controlling the Name Server” in Chapter 7 of DNS and BIND.  5.6  Adding or Removing Zones Without Restarting or Reloading the Name Server  Problem You want to add a new zone or delete an existing zone without restarting or reload- ing a name server.  Solution Add a new zone statement to named.conf or delete an existing one, then run rndc reconfig  for BIND 9  or ndc reconfig  for BIND 8 .  Discussion It’s nice to avoid restarting a busy name server, since restarting clears the cache and takes time on a name server that is authoritative for many zones. A reload, while it  5.6 Adding or Removing Zones Without Restarting or Reloading the Name Server    99  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   doesn’t clear the cache, can take time as the name server checks all of its zone data files to see if they’ve changed. Using reconfig avoids these issues, just scanning named.conf for added or deleted zones.  ndc supports reconfig as of BIND 8.2.2. At BIND 8.2.3, though, you can also use ndc reconfig –noexpired, which prevents the name server from trying to load expired zones.  See Also “Controlling the Name Server” in Chapter 7 of DNS and BIND.  5.7  Initiating a Zone Transfer  Problem You want a slave name server to initiate a zone transfer immediately.  Solution Use the command rndc refresh domain-name-of-zone  for BIND 9  or ndc reload domain-name-of-zone  for BIND 8 . For example:   rndc refresh bar.example  Discussion Note that neither command will cause a zone transfer if the master name server has an equal or lower serial number for the zone: the slave will check the serial number, see that its copy of the zone is current and go back to waiting for the next NOTIFY message or for the refresh timer to pop. If you really need to force a zone transfer to a slave, you’ll have to delete the backup zone data file and restart—not reload—the name server.  Refreshing or reloading individual zones, as shown above, was introduced in BIND 8.2.1 and again in 9.1.0. With older versions of BIND, just use rndc refresh or ndc reload, as appropriate. A full reload takes some time on a name server authoritative for lots of zones, since the name server checks all zone data files to see which have changed.  If you’re refreshing a zone that exists in multiple views on a BIND 9 name server, specify the view with rndc refresh domain-name-of-zone class view. For example:   rndc refresh bar.example in external  100    Chapter 5: BIND Name Server Operations  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Unfortunately, you can’t leave out the class, even though your slave name server probably doesn’t serve any non-Internet class zones.  See Also “Controlling the Name Server” in Chapter 7 of DNS and BIND.  5.8  Restarting a Name Server Automatically If It Dies  Problem You want a name server to restart automatically if it dies.  Solution Use the nanny.pl Perl script included in the BIND 9 distribution. After you’ve unpacked the BIND 9 distribution, you’ll find nanny.pl in contrib nanny nanny.pl.  nanny.pl runs as a daemon, so just modify the variables at the top of the script as needed and then start it. You may also want to configure your host to start nanny.pl at boot time.  There are four variables you may need to customize:  $pid_file_location = ' var run named.pid'; $nameserver_location = 'localhost'; $dig_program = 'dig'; $named_program =  'named';  For example, if you’re starting named with one or more command-line options, change $named_program accordingly, like so:  $named_program = 'named –t  etc namedb –u bind';  Discussion nanny.pl checks every 30 seconds to see if the named process exists using kill –0 against its process ID, and by querying the local name server with dig. If either test fails, the script restarts the name server.  There’s nothing specific to BIND 9 in nanny.pl, so you can use it with BIND 8 name servers, too.  5.8 Restarting a Name Server Automatically If It Dies    101  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   See Also Recipe 1.18, for starting the name server from the command line.  5.9  Restarting a Name Server with the Same Arguments  Problem You want to restart named with ndc, but keep the same command-line arguments.  Solution Specify the command-line arguments after the restart command. For example:   ndc restart –c  tmp named.conf  Or, if you’re not sure what the command-line arguments were, use:   ndc exec  The exec command tells named to exec    a new copy of itself, including any com- mand-line argument it was started with.  Discussion If you run ndc from the command line and named is linked against a faulty copy of getopt   , you may need to specify “--” as the first argument to restart to make sure the options are passed to named correctly.  BIND 9 name servers don’t support restart and exec.  See Also Recipe 3.1, for setting up ndc to work with a name server; Recipe 5.4, for a situation in which you’d restart a name server  in this case, to clear the cache ; and “Control- ling a Name Server” in Chapter 7 of DNS and BIND.  5.10 Controlling Multiple named Processes  with rndc  Problem You want to control multiple named processes running on the same host with rndc.  102    Chapter 5: BIND Name Server Operations  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Solution Since rndc only supports TCP-based communications with name servers, configure the name servers to listen on different addresses for control messages. For example, if your host runs two named processes—one listening on 192.168.0.1 for queries, the other listening on 192.168.0.2—you might configure the first one with this controls statement in its named.conf file:  controls {     inet 192.168.0.1 allow { localnets; } keys { rndc-key; }; };  The second might have this controls statement in named.conf:  controls {     inet 192.168.0.2 allow { localnets; } keys { rndc-key; }; };  If rndc-key is rndc’s default key, you can control the two named processes with:   rndc –s 192.168.0.1  Or:   rndc –s 192.168.0.2  Discussion If you want to use different keys to control the two processes, you can add two server statements to rndc.conf, specifying the proper key to use for each.  You could also set up the two name servers to listen on different control ports, and then use the port server substatement in rndc.conf to distinguish between the two. For example:  server ns1.foo.example {     port 953;     key "rndc-key"; };  server ns1-int.foo.example {     port 1053;     key "rndc-key"; };  This assumes that both ns1.foo.example and ns1-int.foo.example map to the same address.  See Also Recipe 3.3 for configuring rndc to work with a remote name server using the rndc.conf’s server statement.  5.10 Controlling Multiple named Processes with rndc    103  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   5.11 Controlling Multiple named Processes  with ndc  Problem You want to control multiple named processes running on the same host with ndc.  Solution Configure the name servers to create different Unix domain sockets. For example, if the host runs both a caching-only name server and an authoritative-only name server, you might configure a controls statement like this one in the caching-only name server’s named.conf file:  controls {     unix " var run ndc.caching" owner 0 group 0 perm 0660; };  In the other’s named.conf file, you could add this controls statement:  controls {     unix " var run ndc.auth" owner 0 group 0 perm 0660; };  Then, to use ndc to control the caching-only name server, run:   ndc –c  var run ndc.caching  To control the authoritative-only name server, use:   ndc –c  var run ndc.auth  Discussion To make this setup a little easier to use, you could create shell aliases from ndc-caching and ndc-auth to ndc –c  var run ndc.caching and ndc –c  var run ndc.auth, respectively.  You can set this up with TCP-based control channels, too, but BIND 8’s TCP-based control channels aren’t secure. If you opt to use them anyway, see Recipe 5.10 for hints.  See Also Recipe 5.10 and “Two Name Server in One” in Chapter 11 of DNS and BIND.  104    Chapter 5: BIND Name Server Operations  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   5.12 Finding Out Who’s Querying a Name Server  Problem You want to find out which resolvers and name servers are querying a name server.  Solution For BIND 9, turn on query logging with:   rndc querylog  Or, for BIND 8:   ndc querylog  Then examine the name server’s syslog output. The name server will log a one-line message each time it receives a query. For BIND 9, the messages look like this:  May  4 22:45:14 ns1 named[80090]: client 192.168.0.993261: query: www.foo.example IN A This tells us that our name server received a query from the client at 192.168.0.99, port 3261, for A records attached to www.foo.example in the Internet class.  On a BIND 8 name server, the messages look like this:  May  4 22:53:52 ns1 named[80323]: XX+ 192.168.0.99 www.foo.example A IN  Most of the same information is there, but in a slightly different format: the address the query was received from, the domain name the query asked about, the type of query, and the class of query, separated by slashes. The “XX+” at the beginning indi- cates that it is a recursive query. Nonrecursive queries show just “XX.”  Discussion Query logging can come in handy if you’re trying to track down a problem. How- ever, it generates a lot of output—quickly, on a busy name server—so it’s probably a bad idea to use all the time. If you’re really just interested in how many queries the name server receives, use the name server’s statistics instead  Recipes 5.13 and 5.14 .  You can also turn on query logging by assigning the logging category queries to a par- ticular channel. See Recipe 10.3 for details.  There’s no indication in the BIND 9 query logging output of which queries were recursive and which not.  See Also Recipes 5.13 and 5.14, for measuring the queries a name server receives, and Recipe 10.3, for sending one category of messages to a particular file.  5.12 Finding Out Who’s Querying a Name Server    105  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   5.13 Measuring a Name Server’s Performance  Problem You want to measure a name server’s performance.  Solution To measure a name server’s real performance  that is, the number of queries it answers on an hourly or daily basis , dump statistics periodically and compare the numbers. On a BIND 9.1.0 or later name server, for example, you could use rndc stats to dump statistics hourly with this crontab entry:  0    *    *    *    *    root    rndc stats  Every hour, the name server will append data like this to the statistics file  called named.stats in the name server’s working directory, by default :  +++ Statistics Dump +++  1021327908  success 5268 referral 57 nxrrset 7938 nxdomain 127 recursion 1946 failure 153 --- Statistics Dump ---  1021327908   Add the values of success, nxrrset, and nxdomain, and compute the difference between the sums in two successive statistics blocks. Divide by 3600  seconds  to get the query rate in queries per second.  With BIND 8, you use ndc stats to induce the name server to dump statistics, but the name server’s statistics look considerably different than BIND 9’s. Here’s an example:  ++ Name Server Statistics ++  Legend          RR      RNXD    RFwdR   RDupR   RFail         RFErr   RErr    RAXFR   RLame   ROpts         SSysQ   SAns    SFwdQ   SDupQ   SErr         RQ      RIQ     RFwdQ   RDupQ   RTCP         SFwdR   SFail   SFErr   SNaAns  SNXD         RUQ     RURQ    RUXFR   RUUpd  Global          94 0 22 0 0  35 0 0 0 0  7 242727 30 36 0  242744 0 30 0 0  22 0 0 24272 5 0  182058 0 0 0 -- Name Server Statistics –-  This is just part of the statistics output, printed at the end of each block. The infor- mation you need is still there: compute the difference between the values for SAns  sent answers  over time to derive the query rate. To find SAns, look at the line under  106    Chapter 5: BIND Name Server Operations  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   success  referral  nxrrset  nxdomain  recursion  failure  “ Global ”. The second number in the third quintet of numbers  242727 in this example  is SAns.  Discussion BIND 9 didn’t support dumping statistics until 9.1.0. Of course, you shouldn’t be running anything that old, anyway. Here’s a quick key to the meaning of the various BIND 9 statistics:  The number of successful queries  those that return a response other than a referral   The number of queries that resulted in a referral  The number of queries for domain names that didn’t own the type of record requested  The number of queries for domain names that didn’t exist  The number of recursive queries for domain names in the zone that required the name server to send one or more queries  The number of queries that resulted in a failure other than NXDOMAIN  For an explanation of the many statistics kept by a BIND 8 name server, see “Under- standing the BIND Statistics” in Chapter 7 of DNS and BIND.  You may also want to test a name server’s top-end performance: how quickly it can process queries? There’s a program included in the BIND 9 distribution called queryperf that helps with that; you’ll find it in the contrib queryperf subdirectory. Though it’s shipped with BIND 9, it works by sending standard DNS queries, so you can use it to measure the performance of any kind of name server—BIND 9, BIND 8, or “other.”  To build it, cd to contrib queryperf and run configure, then run make:  $ cd contrib queryperf $ . configure $ make  www.foo.example A foo.example SOA  Next, you need to construct an input file, telling queryperf what queries to send to the name server. Each line in the input file must contain a domain name and a type to look up:  5.13 Measuring a Name Server’s Performance    107  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.    The class is assumed to be IN, for Internet. If you want to measure a name server’s performance in processing Hesiod queries, you’re on your own. You’re also a weirdo.   If you want to test a name server’s performance answering queries for authoritative zone data, use domain names in zones that the name server is authoritative for. If you want to test a name server’s performance resolving queries that require recur- sion, use domain names outside of the name server’s authoritative zones. Also, make sure you choose lots of different domain names, or the name server will quickly cache the answers and you won’t get a representative measurement of performance.  Once you’ve created the input file, run queryperf. Use the –d command-line option to specify the name of the input file. You can specify how long  in seconds  you want the test to run with –l, or that you want to go through the list of queries just once with –1. If you give queryperf a time limit and the program exhausts the queries in the input file before the test is over, it’ll start again at the beginning. The –s and –p options allow you to specify the server and port you want to query, respectively. The defaults are the local host and port 53. For other command-line options, run queryperf with an option it doesn’t understand, like –?.  Here’s a sample run of queryperf:  $ queryperf -d input foo.example -l 60  DNS Query Performance Testing Tool Version: $Id: queryperf.c,v 1.1.1.2.2.1 2001 09 27 00.44.26 marka Exp $  [Status] Processing input data [Status] Sending queries [Status] Testing complete  Statistics:    Parse input file:     multiple times   Run time limit:       60 seconds   Ran through file:     0 times    Queries sent:         265935 queries   Queries completed:    265935 queries   Queries lost:         0 queries    Percentage completed: 100.00%   Percentage lost:        0.00%    Started at:           Mon May 13 16:26:28 2002   Finished at:          Mon May 13 16:27:28 2002   Ran for:              60.458815 seconds    Queries per second:   4398.614164 qps  108    Chapter 5: BIND Name Server Operations  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   This was a very short test—60 seconds—of queries for domain names in zones my name server is authoritative for, but the performance is impressive nonetheless: nearly 4,400 queries per second.  Note that you probably don’t want to run a stress test like this on a production name server during work hours. You may even want to run the name server you’re testing on an alternate port, as described in Recipe 3.25.  See Also Recipe 3.25, “Understanding the BIND Statistics” in Chapter 7 of DNS and BIND, and “Capacity Planning” in Chapter 8.  5.14 Measuring Queries for Records  in Particular Zones  Problem You want to measure the number of queries a name server receives for records in zones it is authoritative for.  Solution Use the BIND 9 zone-statistics substatement. To measure the statistics for just a few zones, use zone-statistics as a zone substatement. For example:  zone "foo.example" {     type slave;     masters { 192.168.0.1; };     file "bak.foo.example";     zone-statistics yes; };  options {     directory " var named";     zone-statistics yes; };  +++ Statistics Dump +++  1020821387  success 37 referral 0 nxrrset 60  To keep statistics for all zones, use zone-statistics as an options substatement:  Then, to dump the zone’s statistics, use rndc stats. The statistics are written to the file named.stats in the name server’s working directory, by default. Here’s a short sample of a named.stats file:  5.14 Measuring Queries for Records in Particular Zones    109  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   nxdomain 9 recursion 12 failure 6 success 6 foo.example referral 0 foo.example nxrrset 3 foo.example nxdomain 1 foo.example recursion 0 foo.example failure 0 foo.example --- Statistics Dump ---  1020821387   The first six counters are global: total counts for the name server since it started. The next six are specific to the foo.example zone. The sum of the zone-specific values for success, nxrrset, and nxdomain is the total number of queries for records in the zone.  nxrrset is a count of queries for types of records that didn’t exist, while nxdomain counts queries for domain names that didn’t exist .  Discussion There’s no mechanism comparable to zone-statistics in BIND 8. While you could turn on query logging and extrapolate the same statistics, the overhead would be considerable.  Speaking of overhead, the zone statistics mechanism does use a little extra memory on the name server to store the counters.  See Also Recipe 5.12 for information on query logging, which can tell you who is querying a name server; and Recipe 5.13, for measuring aggregate performance.  5.15 Monitoring a Name Server  Problem You want to monitor a zone’s name servers.  Solution Use a freely available package that supports monitoring name servers. The well- thought-of mon supports monitoring the DNS service. You can get a copy from http:   www.kernel.org software mon . Since the DNS-monitoring portion of the package, dns.monitor, is written in Perl using the Net::DNS module, it’s easy to adapt to your particular needs.  110    Chapter 5: BIND Name Server Operations  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Discussion You can also use Dave Barr’s excellent dnswalk, available from http:  www.visi.com  ~barr dnswalk , for DNS monitoring. Also built using Net::DNS, dnswalk detects lame and unresponsive name servers, as well as many common zone data errors. Just make sure dnswalk can transfer a copy of the zone you want to monitor, and specify dnswalk’s –l command-line option to turn on lame delegation checking. Then you can run dnswalk periodically from cron and send yourself the output.  See Also Recipes 9.7 through 9.10 for examples of programming with Net::DNS.  5.16 Limiting Concurrent Zone Transfers  Problem You want to limit the number of concurrent zone transfers a name server will allow.  Solution On a BIND 9 master name server, use the transfers-out options substatement. For example:  This limits the number of zone transfers the master will serve concurrently. The default limit is 10. Unfortunately, BIND 8 name servers don’t support transfers-out.  On a slave name server, use the transfers-in options substatement. For example:  options {     directory " var named";     transfers-out 4; };  options {     directory " var named";     transfers-in 4; };  This limits the number of concurrent zone transfers the slave will request from its master name servers. The default is also 10.  Discussion There’s another options substatement available for limiting the number of concurrent zone transfers a slave name server will request from any one master: transfers-per-ns.  5.16 Limiting Concurrent Zone Transfers    111  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   The default value for transfers-per-ns is two, and you can override the limit for particu- lar name servers using the transfers substatement of the server statement. For example:  server 10.0.0.1 {     transfers 10; };  If you limit the number of concurrent zone transfers too aggressively, it may take the slave name server longer to converge with its master. For example, if the slave can only start 2 concurrent zone transfers from its master but needs to transfer 10 zones, it’ll start 2, wait until 1 completes, start another, and so on, until all 10 have trans- ferred. That will probably take more time than just starting all 10 at once.  Conversely, allowing too many concurrent zone transfers soaks up a lot of resources on both master and slave name servers.  See Also Recipe 5.17, for limiting the number of TCP clients of any kind a name server will serve; and “Zone Transfers” in Chapter 10 of DNS and BIND.  5.17 Limiting Concurrent TCP Clients  Problem You want to limit the number of concurrent TCP clients a name server handles.  Solution Use the BIND 9 tcp-clients options substatement. For example:  options {     directory " var named";     tcp-clients 500; };  The default limit is 100 TCP clients.  Discussion The limit on TCP clients applies to both discrete TCP queries and TCP zone trans- fers. A name server probably won’t receive many TCP-based queries from resolvers, since nearly all resolvers send UDP-based queries by default. Most zone transfer requests, however, are TCP-based so don’t set the limit lower than transfers-out.  Remember that the operating system places a limit on the number of file descriptors available to the named process, and each TCP connection to the name server uses  112    Chapter 5: BIND Name Server Operations  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   one of these. If you make the tcp-clients limit higher than the OS-imposed limit, it’s possible the name server will run out of file descriptors, which it needs for reading and writing zone data files and listening for control messages.  If a name server reaches the limit on TCP clients, it will refuse those TCP-based que- ries and you’ll see messages like this one in its syslog output:  named[579]: client 192.168.0.111567: no more TCP clients: quota reached  Check whether the TCP queries the name server is serving are legitimate  e.g., not part of some distributed denial of service attack . If they are, raise the limit to accom- modate them.  There’s no corresponding substatement in BIND 8.  See Also Recipe 5.16, for limiting concurrent zone transfers.  5.18 Limiting Concurrent Recursive Clients  Problem You want to limit the number of concurrent recursive clients a name server handles.  Solution Use the BIND 9 recursive-clients options substatement. For example:  options {     directory " var named";     recursive-clients 500; };  The default limit is 1,000 recursive clients.  Discussion With recursive-clients, you can limit the number of recursive queriers a name server will handle concurrently. A name server receives recursive queries both from resolv- ers and from name servers that use it as a forwarder. Since each recursive query con- sumes about 20K of memory, the total amount of memory needed to service 1,000 queriers—the default limit—is about 20MB. If a name server doesn’t have that much real memory available, you may need to set its limit lower.  If a name server reaches this limit, it will refuse further recursive queries and you’ll see messages like this one in its syslog output:  named[579]: client 192.168.0.111567: no more recursive clients: quota reached  5.18 Limiting Concurrent Recursive Clients    113  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Check whether the recursive clients the name server is serving are legitimate  e.g., not part of some distributed denial of service attack . If they are, and there’s suffi- cient memory available on the host, raise the limit to accommodate them.  There’s no corresponding substatement in BIND 8.  See Also “Resource Limits” in Chapter 10 of DNS and BIND.  5.19 Dynamically Updating a Zone  Problem You want to dynamically update a zone.  Solution Use the nsupdate program to send updates to your zone. First, start nsupdate in inter- active mode:  $ nsupdate  The basic command in nsupdate’s interactive mode is update. To add a new record, use update add. To delete one or more records, use update delete. update add takes a resource record, including an explicit TTL, as an argument. For example:  > update add host.foo.example. 3600 A 192.168.0.31  You can leave out the class, though; it defaults to IN, for “Internet.”  To delete a particular record, specify the record as an argument to update delete:  > update delete foo.example. MX 10 mail.foo.example.  To delete all records of a particular type attached to a domain name, specify the domain name and type as an argument to update delete:  > update delete foo.example. MX  Finally, to delete all records of any type attached to a domain name, specify just the domain name as an argument to update delete:  > update delete host.foo.example.  You can perform more than one add or delete operation at once by specifying multi- ple update commands, each on its own line, as long as the changes are made to a sin- gle zone. Once you’re ready to send the update, type:  If you’re running a BIND 8 version of nsupdate, just type a blank line:  > send  >  114    Chapter 5: BIND Name Server Operations  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Discussion Here’s a complete nsupdate session:  $ nsupdate > update delete www.foo.example. IN A > update add www.foo.example. 3600 IN A 192.168.0.89 > send  nsupdate can communicate with  and hence update  any name server. It looks up the SOA record of the zone the domain name in the update belongs in and sends the update to the name server listed in the MNAME field. Consequently, you should make sure the MNAME field of each of your zones’ SOA records contains the domain name of the real primary master name server for the zone.  Since nsupdate gives you very little feedback, you may find it helpful to run nsupdate with the –d  debug  option. That way, you can see the output from the name server that receives the update.  See Also nsupdate 8 ; Recipe 3.10, for how to allow dynamic updates to a zone; Recipes 5.20, 5.21, and 5.22 for variations on sending dynamic updates to a name server; Recipes 9.9 and 9.10, for sending dynamic updates programmatically; and “DNS Dynamic Update” in Chapter 10 of DNS and BIND.  5.20 Sending Dynamic Updates to a Particular  Name Server  Problem You want to send a dynamic update to a particular name server, possibly not the one in the MNAME field of the zone’s SOA record.  Solution Use the BIND 9 version of nsupdate and specify the name server you want to send the update to as the argument to the server command. Then specify the update with an update command. For example:  $ nsupdate > server ns2.foo.example. > update delete foo.example. TXT > update add foo.example. 3600 TXT "This is a test record" > send  5.20 Sending Dynamic Updates to a Particular Name Server    115  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Discussion nsupdate continues to send updates to the specified name server until you designate a different name server with another server command or exit.  The BIND 8 version of nsupdate doesn’t support the server command, but you can use a BIND 9 nsupdate with a BIND 8 name server. In fact, you can use nsupdate with any name server that supports dynamic update. Dynamic update messages have a standard format, after all.  You can use an IP address as the argument to server, too.  See Also nsupdate 8 .  5.21 Setting Prerequisites in a Dynamic Update  Problem You want to set a prerequisite in a dynamic update.  Solution Use nsupdate and specify the prerequisite you want as an argument to the prereq command. Then specify the update with an update command. nsupdate supports the following kinds of prerequisites:  The following domain name doesn’t exist.  The following domain name exists.  nxdomain  yxdomain  nxrrset  yxrrset  The following domain name doesn’t own records of the specified type.  The following domain name owns records of the specified type. If the RDATA is specified, it must match, too.  For example, you could use this nsupdate command to add an A record to foo.example only if foo.example doesn’t already have an A record:  $ nsupdate > prereq nxrrset foo.example A > update add foo.example. 3600 A 192.168.0.86 > send  116    Chapter 5: BIND Name Server Operations  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   In order to change www.foo.example’s A record to 192.168.0.86 only if it’s currently 192.168.0.99, you could use:  $ nsupdate > prereq yxrrset www.foo.example A 192.168.0.99 > update delete www.foo.example A 192.168.0.99 > update add www.foo.example 3600 A 192.168.0.86 > send  Discussion Remember that the BIND 8 version of nsupdate doesn’t support the send command. Instead, just type a blank line.  See Also nsupdate 8  and “DNS Dynamic Update” in Chapter 10 of DNS and BIND.  5.22 Sending TSIG-Signed Dynamic Updates  Problem You want to send a TSIG-signed dynamic update.  Solution Use nsupdate’s –k command-line option or the key command in nsupdate’s interac- tive mode.  The –k command-line option takes as an argument the path to a file that contains a TSIG key, as generated by the dnssec-keygen program. Those files have names of the form Kkey-name.+157+number.key. For example:  $ nsupdate –k Kdhcp-server.foo.example.+157+27656.key  nsupdate’s key command takes the name of a TSIG key and the base 64 representa- tion of the key data  just like in a key statement  as arguments. For example:  $ nsupdate > key dhcp-server.foo.example CPB4fRniZYUPobYF 4igZg== > update delete foo.example. NS ns1.foo.example. > send  Discussion Remember that the name of the key, not just the key data, needs to match in nsupdate and in the name server’s configuration.  5.22 Sending TSIG-Signed Dynamic Updates    117  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   BIND 8’s version of nsupdate doesn’t support the key command  yet another reason to use BIND 9’s nsupdate . Also, the syntax of the argument to –k is different: key- directory:key-name. For example:  $ nsupdate –k  var named:dhcp-server.foo.example  Note that the BIND 8 nsupdate really doesn’t like key files generated with BIND 9’s dnssec-keygen; use BIND 8’s dnskeygen instead.  Finally, BIND 9’s nsupdate also supports a –y option, which takes as arguments the name of the key and the key data, as in:  $ nsupdate –y dhcp-server.foo.example:CPB4fRniZYUPobYF 4igZg==  Using the –y option is a bad idea on any host on which unauthorized users have accounts, since the key name and data are visible to anyone who can run ps.  See Also nsupdate 8 ; Recipe 3.10, for allowing TSIG-signed dynamic updates to a zone; and Recipe 9.10, for sending TSIG-signed updates programmatically.  5.23 Setting Up a Backup Primary Master  Name Server  Problem You want to establish a “backup” primary master name server, to assume the respon- sibilities of the regular primary master name server, should it fail.  Solution Configure slave name servers with the address of the regular primary master name server first in their masters substatements, then with the address of the backup pri- mary master. For example, if you wanted to designate 192.168.0.2 as the backup pri- mary master name server, you could use zone statements like this one:  zone "foo.example" {     type slave;     masters {         192.168.0.1;       regular primary master         192.168.0.2;       backup primary master     };     file "bak.foo.example"; };  The backup primary master should serve as a slave when everything’s functioning correctly.  But be sure to configure the backup primary master to allow zone  118    Chapter 5: BIND Name Server Operations  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   transfers to the other slaves.  Then, if the regular primary master fails, you can fol- low the instructions in Recipe 5.24 to turn the backup primary master name server into a full-fledged primary master.  Discussion Most versions of BIND contact the first name server in the masters list first. They only query the second name server if the first one doesn’t respond—because it’s crashed, for example—or if there’s an error in the response. As long as the regular, workaday primary master continues responding, they’ll transfer the zone from it.  BIND 8 name servers from 8.2 on query all of the name servers listed in the masters substatement, and transfer the zone from the one that replies with the highest serial number  if there’s a tie, the one earliest in the list . That will still work when the nor- mal primary master is running, and if it fails, the name servers get their zone trans- fers from the backup.  See Also Recipe 5.24 for instructions on what to do when a primary master name server fails.  5.24 Promoting a Slave Name Server  to the Primary Master  Problem You want to “promote” a slave name server to be the primary master name server.  Solution Change the zone statement for the zones you want the slave to be primary master for from type slave to type master, and delete the masters substatements. For example, this zone statement:  zone "foo.example" {     type slave;     masters { 192.68.0.1; };     file "bak.foo.example"; };  Becomes this zone statement:  zone "foo.example" {     type master;     file "bak.foo.example"; };  5.24 Promoting a Slave Name Server to the Primary Master    119  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   If you allow dynamic updates to any of the zones, change the MNAME field of those zones’ SOA records to the domain name of the new primary and add an allow-update or update-policy substatement. For example:  zone "foo.example" {     type master;     file "bak.foo.example";     allow-update { 192.168.0.1; }; };  If you restricted zone transfers from the old primary, duplicate the allow-transfer substatement from the old zone statement.  Then reload the name server with rndc reload or ndc reload, as appropriate.  If you followed the instructions in Recipe 5.23 and set up the slaves to use this name server as their backup master, you’re done. If not, you’ll need to reconfigure your slaves to use the new primary as their master. Just change the IP address in the masters substatement to the address of the new primary and reload.  Discussion If you’re so inclined, you can rename the zone data file to fit your standard for primary master zones. For example, we might rename bak.foo.example to db.foo.example.  Check the zone statement on the old primary master for other substatements that you might need to duplicate on the new primary master, such as also-notify and check-names.  See Also Recipe 5.23 and “Coping with Disaster” in Chapter 8 of DNS and BIND.  5.25 Running Multiple Primary Master Name  Servers for the Same Zone  Problem You want to run more than one primary master name server for the same zone.  Solution Configure multiple name servers with zone statements of type master for the zone, then use a program such as scp, rdist, or rsync to keep the zone data files synchronized.  120    Chapter 5: BIND Name Server Operations  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Discussion An rdist distfile to synchronize zone data files between two name servers might look like this:  DUPS =   ns2.foo.example ns3.foo.example    FILES =    var named db.foo.example    ${FILES} -> ${DUPS}      install;     special "rndc reload foo.example";  A scheme like this won’t work with a dynamically updated zone, because the zone data file won’t usually be rewritten right away after the name server receives an update. Moreover, if more than one primary master actually accepts dynamic updates, rsync-style synchronization might corrupt the zone data file.  See Also rdist 1  and scp 1 .  5.26 Creating a Zone Programmatically  Problem You want to create a new zone on a name server programmatically.  Solution Create a minimal zone data file that uses only relative domain names in the owner field of the records. For example:  $TTL 86400 @    IN    SOA    ns1.foo.example.    hostmaster.foo.example.           2002051200      3600      900      604800      3600        IN    NS    ns1.foo.example.     IN    NS    ns2.foo.example.      IN    A     10.0.0.1      IN    MX    10 mail.foo.example.  www IN    CNAME    @  5.26 Creating a Zone Programmatically    121  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Then write a script to add a new zone statement to the name server’s named.conf file, referring to the zone data file. Finally, use rndc reconfig or ndc reconfig, as appropri- ate, to tell the name server to reread named.conf.  An example script, addzone.pl, is included in the tar file that accompanies this book  see the Preface for details . To run addzone.pl, specify the domain name of the zone and the name of the minimal zone data file as arguments:   addzone.pl baz.example db.template  Discussion addzone.pl is fairly simple-minded: it assumes its working directory is the name server’s working directory. And I’m sure some Perl hacker could replace it with a sin- gle-line script.  See Also Recipe 1.15 for configuring a name server as the primary master for a zone, and Rec- ipe 5.6 for adding a zone without restarting the name server.  5.27 Migrating from One Domain Name  to Another  Problem You need to migrate from one domain name to another because you’re changing the name of your zone.  Solution Once you’ve established the new zone, create aliases pointing from each domain name in the old zone to the corresponding domain name in the new zone. For example:  a.foo.example.    IN    CNAME    a.bar.example. b.foo.example.    IN    CNAME    b.bar.example. c.d.foo.example.  IN    CNAME    c.d.bar.example.  Change the NS and MX records in the old zone, as necessary, so they don’t point to aliases:  foo.example.    IN    NS    ns1.bar.example.                 IN    NS    ns2.bar.example.                 IN    MX    10 mail.bar.example.  122    Chapter 5: BIND Name Server Operations  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Change the PTR records for these hosts to reverse-map to their new domain names, too:  20.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa.    IN    PTR    a.bar.example. 21.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa.    IN    PTR    b.bar.example. 22.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa.    IN    PTR    c.d.bar.example.  Next, configure any resolvers that use the old domain name as their local domain name to use the new one; for example:  domain bar.example  This may require additional changes to the configuration of the host. If the host runs a mailer or a web server, check the server’s configuration files. You may need to change the domain name the mailer uses in return addresses or the domain name it sees as local. You may need to reconfigure the web server with its new domain name or install a new SSL server certificate. Also, check that any authorization files refer to the new domain names, since IP addresses will now reverse-map to them.  Wait for some grace period, and then remove the aliases and the old zone. If you’re not sure how long to keep the old zone around, you can use the zone statistics described in Recipe 5.14 to determine whether the aliases are still being used.  Discussion If you run BIND 9 name servers for the zone, you may be able to use the new DNAME record to simplify the setup of the old zone. DNAME records work like substitution rules in sed or Perl. For example, this DNAME record will “synthesize” CNAME records aliasing each domain name in foo.example to the corresponding domain name in bar.example:  foo.example.    IN    DNAME    bar.example.  A querier looking up a.foo.example will find this CNAME record, created on the fly from the DNAME record:  a.foo.example.    IN    CNAME    a.bar.example.  While a querier looking up c.d.foo.example will have this CNAME record returned:  c.d.foo.example.    IN    CNAME    c.d.bar.example.  See Also Recipe 2.3 for creating individual aliases using CNAME records, Recipe 5.14 for measuring zone statistics, and Recipes 9.2 and 9.3 for configuration of a resolver’s local domain name.  5.27 Migrating from One Domain Name to Another    123  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   CHAPTER 6 Chapter 6 Delegation and Registration  Introduction  6.0 As the administrator of one or more zones, you need to manage two kinds of delega- tion: from your zones’ parent zones to your zone, and from your zones to their sub- domains. Both are ongoing processes:    After registering a domain name  as in Recipe 1.5 , you still must update the dele- gation any time the set of authoritative name servers changes. Recipes 6.6 and 6.7 describe ways of handling this as painlessly as possible.    After delegating a subdomain of your zone to a set of name servers, you must check the delegation periodically  Recipe 6.5  to make sure the delegation remains correct.  You also need to manage this delegation for two kinds of zones: forward- and reverse- mapping zones. Delegating reverse-mapping subdomains that correspond to a network or subnet involves more than you might expect. It’s covered in Recipes 6.3 and 6.4.  6.1  Delegating a Subdomain  Problem You want to delegate a subdomain of your zone to a set of name servers.  Solution Add NS records to your zone’s data file delegating the subdomain to the name serv- ers. For example, to delegate the baz.bar.example subdomain to the name servers ns1.baz.bar.example and ns2.foo.example, you’d add these two NS records to the bar.example zone data file:  baz.bar.example.    IN    NS    ns1.baz.bar.example. baz.bar.example.    IN    NS    ns2.foo.example.  124  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   In this example, you’ll also need to add an A record for ns1.baz.bar.example, even though the name server’s A record would normally appear in the baz.bar.example zone:  ns1.baz.bar.example.    IN    A    10.0.1.1  Without the A record—called a glue record—another name server that was referred to ns1.baz.bar.example would not be able to follow the referral, since in order to find ns1.baz.bar.example’s address, it would need to query ns1.baz.bar.example. That’s like trying to find someone’s telephone number by calling and asking.  Discussion The simplest test for determining whether you need to include a name server’s A record with delegation is to check whether the domain name of the name server ends in the domain name of the subdomain being delegated to it. If so, you need to include an A record for the name server.  The name servers that the subdomain is delegated to need a zone data file for the subdomain and a zone statement configuring them as authoritative for the zone. So, on ns1.baz.bar.example and ns2.foo.example, you’d expect to find a zone statement like this:  zone "baz.bar.example" {     type master;     file "db.baz.bar.example"; };  Of course, one of the name servers is probably a slave for baz.bar.example.  See Also Recipes 1.15 and 1.16, for instructions on configuring a primary master and a slave name server for a zone, and “How to Become a Parent: Creating Subdomains” in Chapter 9 of DNS and BIND.  6.2  Delegating a Subdomain of a Reverse-Mapping Zone  Problem You want to delegate a subdomain of your reverse-mapping zone to a set of name servers.  Solution Just as with a forward-mapping zone, add NS records to your reverse-mapping zone’s data file delegating the subdomain to the name servers. For example, to  6.2 Delegating a Subdomain of a Reverse-Mapping Zone    125  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   delegate the 1.168.192.in-addr.arpa subdomain to the name servers ns1.baz.bar. example and ns2.foo.example, you’d add these two NS records to the 168.192.in- addr.arpa zone data file:  1.168.192.in-addr.arpa.    IN    NS    ns1.baz.bar.example. 1.168.192.in-addr.arpa.    IN    NS    ns2.foo.example.  Discussion There’s very little difference between delegating a subdomain of a forward-mapping zone and a subdomain of a reverse-mapping zone: you add NS records to the parent zone, specifying the name of the subdomain and the domain names of the name serv- ers. Some of the labels in the subdomain’s name are the octets in an IP address, but the name server doesn’t care about that. The correspondence between octets and labels causes problems if you use network or subnet masks that don’t break on an octet boundary—you end up with either multiple zones per network or subnet or multiple networks per zone. For more, see Recipes 6.3 and 6.4. Oh, there is one difference in delegating reverse-mapping zones: glue A records are rarely necessary in reverse-mapping zones, since most people don’t give their name servers names like ns1.1.168.192.in-addr.arpa.  See Also Recipes 6.3 and 6.4, for delegating reverse mapping for networks with network or subnet masks that don’t break on an octet boundary.  6.3  Delegating Reverse-Mapping for Networks with Non-Octet Masks  Problem You want to delegate responsibility for reverse-mapping a network’s IP addresses to a set of name servers, but the network mask or subnet mask doesn’t fall on an octet boundary.  Solution Determine how many reverse-mapping zones correspond to the network. Here’s a table to show you how many you’ll have.  Size of network  9  10  Number of reverse-mapping 128 reverse-mapping zones such as 2.1.in-addr.arpa 64 “”  126    Chapter 6: Delegation and Registration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Size of network  11  12  13  14  15  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  25–32  Number of reverse-mapping 32 “” 16 “” 8 “” 4 “” 2 “” 128 reverse-mapping zones such as 3.2.1.in-addr.arpa 64 “” 32 “” 16 “” 8 “” 4 “” 2 “” See Recipe 6.4  For example, say your network is 10 8 and you want to delegate the reverse-map- ping zones for the subnet 10.192 10 to your European subsidiary’s name servers. That subnetwork corresponds to 64 reverse-mapping zones, from 192.10.in-addr.arpa to 255.10.in-addr.arpa. That’s a lot of delegation to add to the 10.in-addr.arpa zone data file: if each zone has two name servers, that’s 128 NS records!  BIND name servers give you a shortcut, though. You can use the $GENERATE control statement to add a group of records that differ only by a number. For example, if your European subsidiary’s name servers are called ns1.eu.corp.example and ns2.eu.corp.example, you could delegate all 64 reverse-mapping zones to them with just these two $GENERATE control statements:  $GENERATE 192-255 $ NS ns1.eu.corp.example. $GENERATE 192-255 $ NS ns2.eu.corp.example.  Discussion Unfortunately, there’s no corresponding way to generate the zone statements you’ll need on the name servers the zones are delegated to. You’d need a full 64 zone state- ments in each name server’s named.conf file.  See Also Recipe 6.4 for handling networks smaller than a  24, and “Subnetting on a Non- Octet Boundary” in Chapter 9 of DNS and BIND.  6.3 Delegating Reverse-Mapping for Networks with Non-Octet Masks    127  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   6.4  Delegating Reverse-Mapping for Networks Smaller than a  24  Problem You want to delegate responsibility for reverse-mapping a network’s IP addresses to a set of name servers, but the network or subnet is smaller than a  24.  Solution Add CNAME records to the domain names that would normally own PTR records, making those domain names aliases to domain names in other zones. Those zones can be either new zones or existing zones. If they are new zones, delegate the zones to the appropriate name servers. If they are existing zones, make sure they’re already delegated to the proper name servers. Here’s an example. Say you manage 0.168.192.in-addr.arpa, the reverse-mapping zone for the network 192.168.0 24. You have divided it into two subnets, though: 192.168.0.0 25 and 192.168.0.128 25. You’d like to delegate responsibility for main- taining each subnet’s reverse-mapping information to a different set of name servers, but you’ve only got a single reverse-mapping zone, 0.168.192.in-addr.arpa. So you add CNAME records to the zone data file for 0.168.192.in-addr.arpa. In addition, the administrator of the first subnet, 192.168.0.0 25, wants a new sub- domain, 0-127.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa, delegated to his name servers. The adminis- trator of the 192.168.0.128 25 subnet has an existing zone, bar.example, and he’d like to manage just that zone. For the first subnet, you add CNAME records like these:  1.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa.    IN    CNAME    1.0-127.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa. 2.0.168.l92.in-addr.arpa.    IN    CNAME    2.0-127.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa.  For the second subnet, you add CNAME records like these:  129.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa.    IN    CNAME    129.0.168.192.bar.example. 130.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa.    IN    CNAME    130.0.168.192.bar.example.  Since the 0-127.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa subdomain is new, you’ll also need to add delegation to the 0.168.192.in-addr.arpa zone data file:  0-127.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa.    IN    NS    ns1.foo.example. 0-127.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa.    IN    NS    ns2.foo.example.  On ns1.foo.example and ns2.foo.example, the administrator would add zone state- ments like this one:  zone "0-127.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa" {     type master;     file "db.192.168.0.0-127"; };  128    Chapter 6: Delegation and Registration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   And within the zone data file for 0-127.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa, he’d add PTR records like these:  1.0-127.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa.    IN    PTR    ns1.foo.example. 2.0-127.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa.    IN    PTR    mail.foo.example.  The administrator of the second subnet can add PTR records like these to the zone data file for bar.example:  129.0.168.192.bar.example.    IN    PTR    monkey.bar.example. 130.0.168.192.bar.example.    IN    PTR    martini.bar.example.  Discussion This scheme is fairly simple, although its simplicity is obscured by all the nasty syn- tax. Basically, where you’d normally add PTR records in the 0.168.192.in-addr.arpa zone, you add CNAME records that create aliases to domain names in other zones. Then, at the domain names those aliases point to, you attach PTR records. A name server looking up a PTR record for 2.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa, for example, will find that that domain name is an alias for 2.0-127.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa, and on a suc- cessive lookup will find the PTR record attached to 2.0-127.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa.  If you need to create lots of very similar CNAME records, avail yourself of the $GENERATE control statement, introduced back in Recipe 2.20. For example, you could create CNAME records for all of the 192.168.0.0 25 network with just this control statement:  $GENERATE 1-127 $ CNAME $.0-127.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa.  The naming scheme I used for the new zone, 0-127.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa, reflects both the values of the first three octets of the reverse-mapped addresses  192.168.0  and the range of values in the fourth octet  0 to 127 . This scheme is just a useful convention, though; there’s nothing magic about it. If you prefer a different scheme, you’re welcome to use it.  See Also Recipe 2.20, for the syntax of the $GENERATE control statement; RFC 2317, the official description of the technique; and “Subnetting on a Non-Octet Boundary” in Chapter 9 of DNS and BIND.  6.5  Checking Delegation  Problem You need to check the delegation of a zone.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  6.5 Checking Delegation    129   Solution There are several ways to check a zone’s delegation. One of the easiest is to use the +trace option supported by the BIND 9 version of dig. When you specify +trace, dig begins by looking up NS records for the root zone, using the local name server, and then sends a nonrecursive query to one of the root name servers. It continues by fol- lowing referrals to other name servers until it finds the answer to the question speci- fied on the command line. Here’s an example:  $ dig +trace cnn.com  ;  > DiG 9.2.1  > +trace cnn.com ;; global options:  printcmd .                       516931  IN      NS      A.ROOT-SERVERS.NET. .                       516931  IN      NS      B.ROOT-SERVERS.NET. .                       516931  IN      NS      C.ROOT-SERVERS.NET. .                       516931  IN      NS      D.ROOT-SERVERS.NET. .                       516931  IN      NS      E.ROOT-SERVERS.NET. .                       516931  IN      NS      F.ROOT-SERVERS.NET. .                       516931  IN      NS      G.ROOT-SERVERS.NET. .                       516931  IN      NS      H.ROOT-SERVERS.NET. .                       516931  IN      NS      I.ROOT-SERVERS.NET. .                       516931  IN      NS      J.ROOT-SERVERS.NET. .                       516931  IN      NS      K.ROOT-SERVERS.NET. .                       516931  IN      NS      L.ROOT-SERVERS.NET. .                       516931  IN      NS      M.ROOT-SERVERS.NET. ;; Received 292 bytes from 192.168.0.153 192.168.0.1  in 13 ms  com.                    172800  IN      NS      A.GTLD-SERVERS.NET. com.                    172800  IN      NS      G.GTLD-SERVERS.NET. com.                    172800  IN      NS      H.GTLD-SERVERS.NET. com.                    172800  IN      NS      C.GTLD-SERVERS.NET. com.                    172800  IN      NS      I.GTLD-SERVERS.NET. com.                    172800  IN      NS      B.GTLD-SERVERS.NET. com.                    172800  IN      NS      D.GTLD-SERVERS.NET. com.                    172800  IN      NS      L.GTLD-SERVERS.NET. com.                    172800  IN      NS      F.GTLD-SERVERS.NET. com.                    172800  IN      NS      J.GTLD-SERVERS.NET. com.                    172800  IN      NS      K.GTLD-SERVERS.NET. com.                    172800  IN      NS      E.GTLD-SERVERS.NET. com.                    172800  IN      NS      M.GTLD-SERVERS.NET. ;; Received 457 bytes from 198.41.0.453 A.ROOT-SERVERS.NET  in 80 ms  cnn.com.                172800  IN      NS      TWDNS-01.NS.AOL.com. cnn.com.                172800  IN      NS      TWDNS-02.NS.AOL.com. cnn.com.                172800  IN      NS      TWDNS-03.NS.AOL.com. cnn.com.                172800  IN      NS      TWDNS-04.NS.AOL.com. ;; Received 188 bytes from 192.5.6.3053 A.GTLD-SERVERS.NET  in 78 ms  cnn.com.                300     IN      A       64.236.24.4 cnn.com.                300     IN      A       64.236.24.12  130    Chapter 6: Delegation and Registration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

This traces the iterative name resolution process an external name server would use to resolve cnn.com domain names. The fact that it succeeded shows that the delegation from the com zone’s name servers  one of them, anyway  to cnn.com works.  Discussion The tools dnswalk and doc also check delegation. dnswalk checks delegation to sub- domains of the zone you designate on the command line if you use the –l option— but it needs to transfer the zone to check it, so don’t bother running a command like:  $ dnswalk com.  However, it’s very useful if you want to check the delegations below your zone.  doc, which is included in the BIND 8 tar file of contributed utilities  available in the same directory as the BIND 8 source code—see Recipe 1.11 for details , also checks delegation to a zone’s name servers, as well as synchronization between those name servers and their parent name servers.  See Also Recipe 1.11 for instructions on how to get the BIND 8 source code  as well as the contributed utilities , and Recipe 5.15 for how to get dnswalk.  6.6 Moving a Name Server  Problem You want to move a name server to another address.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  6.6 Moving a Name Server    131   Solution If you have three or more authoritative name servers registered with your registrar, remove the one you’ll move well ahead of the change. This entails removing the NS record pointing to the name server in your zone data and using your registrar’s inter- face to request that they remove the NS record delegating the zone to the name server from the parent zone. Wait until the NS record and corresponding A record are removed from your parent zone. After the move, change the name server’s A record in your zone data and add the name server’s NS record to your zone data. Then use your registrar’s interface to request that an NS record delegating the zone to the name server at its new address be added to the parent zone.  If you only have two authoritative name servers, consider adding another and using the previous solution. If you can’t do that, arrange to have the name server answer on both its old and new addresses for a period of time  for example, by adding an IP address alias on the name server’s network interface . Then change the name server’s A record in your zone and in your parent zone through your registrar.  You may do this through the same form that you use to register a name server, or at least a simi- lar form.  Once you see the new record in your parent zone, wait until one TTL has passed. Then remove the old address from your name server’s configuration.  Discussion The reason this is more complicated than moving a plain vanilla host is that a name server’s address usually appears in two places: your own zone’s data file and your par- ent zone. While you have direct control over your own zone, you must request changes to your parent zone through your registrar. And you can’t be sure when the change to your parent zone will occur: it often takes a day or two for changes to take effect.  That’s why removing the delegation to the name server that’s moving ahead of time works well. It gives you the freedom to change the name server’s address whenever you like. Then, after you’ve moved the name server, you can add it back at your leisure.  The reason this method doesn’t work if you only have two name servers is that you never want to be left with only one authoritative name server for your zone. Conse- quently, you can’t remove the delegation to a name server in advance of the move. You also shouldn’t request the change of address through your registrar and try to synchronize the move with the change to your parent zone, since you’ll inevitably end up with only one registered name server, at least for a little while.  See Also Recipes 1.5 and 1.6 for information on the registration process, and Recipe 2.16 for the related process of changing data about a host that’s not a name server.  132    Chapter 6: Delegation and Registration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   6.7  Changing Your Zone’s Name Servers  Problem You want to change all of the registered name servers for your zone.  Solution If you can, arrange to have the old name servers running and authoritative for your zone throughout the change. This still makes the process easier.  First, configure the new name servers as authoritative for your zone  or, if they’re run by someone else, like your ISP, ask that they set them up . Once the new name serv- ers are configured and answering authoritatively to queries in your zone, add NS records to your zone data for the new name servers and request that your registrar add those name servers to your zone’s delegation information. When the delegation information has been updated in your parent zone, request that your registrar remove the delegation to the old name servers. Once that delegation information is gone from your parent zone, wait for one TTL on the delegation records to pass, then remove the NS records for the old name servers from the zone and, if you want, decommission the old name servers.  Discussion Arranging to have both sets  old and new  of your name servers running simulta- neously helps you make the required changes on your own schedule. It would be nearly impossible to coordinate the simultaneous decommissioning of the old name servers and commissioning of the new name servers with the changes to your zone’s delegation information in your parent zone. With both sets running at once, you can ask your registrar to add the new ones, wait for the new delegation information to appear, then ask the registrar to delete the old ones.  When you establish the new authoritative name servers, you may initially want to configure them as slaves for your zone, loading from the primary master. If the pri- mary master is among the name servers being decommissioned, you can later move the primary to one of the new name servers and reconfigure the other slaves to trans- fer from the new primary.  See Also Recipes 1.5 and 1.6 for information on the registration process, and Recipe 6.6 for instructions on moving just one name server.  6.7 Changing Your Zone’s Name Servers    133  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   CHAPTER 7 Chapter 7 Security  Introduction  7.0 Name server security is no great mystery. It’s largely a matter of understanding the services a name server provides, then making sure it provides them only to autho- rized entities. Most name servers provide authoritative name service, recursive name service, and zone transfers, and some handle dynamic updates, too. Typically, you’ll want to limit a name server to:    Accepting recursive queries from the resolvers that are authorized to use it   Accepting any nonrecursive queries in zones it’s authoritative for   Providing zone transfers only to authorized slaves   Accepting dynamic updates only from authorized updaters  There are also a few operating system–level precautions you can take, such as run- ning a name server in a chroot    “jail” and running it as a user other than root.  The trick, then, is identifying who’s authorized to use the name server’s services, and configuring the name server to enforce the necessary restrictions. This chapter helps you do both.  7.1  Concealing a Name Server’s Version  Problem Modern BIND name servers respond with their version to queries for TXT records attached to the pseudo-domain name version.bind in the CHAOSNET class. For example:  $ dig version.bind txt chaos  ;  > DiG 9.2.1  > version.bind txt chaos ;; global options:  printcmd  134  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   ;; Got answer: ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 5096 ;; flags: qr aa rd; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0  ;; QUESTION SECTION: ;version.bind.                  CH      TXT  ;; ANSWER SECTION: version.bind.           0       CH      TXT     "9.2.1"  You want to conceal the version a name server returns.  Solution The simplest way to accomplish this is to use the version options substatement. The version substatement takes it as a string to return to version.bind queries as an argu- ment. For example:  options {     directory " var named";     version "None of your business"; };  Some folks, however, don’t want their name servers to return anything, not even a bogus answer, to unauthorized queriers. Others want authorized queriers to see the real version instead of a bogus one.  To set that up, create a CHAOSNET zone called bind and a zone statement for it in named.conf. Then use allow-query to restrict queries to the zone. Here’s a sample bind zone data file:  $TTL 1d @    CH    SOA     ns1.foo.example.    hostmaster.foo.example.           2002052600 86400 3600 604800 3600        CH    NS    ns1.foo.example.  version.bind.    CH    TXT    "BIND 9.2.1"  Notice that the records in the bind zone are all in the CHAOSNET class, as you would expect.  On a BIND 8 name server, the zone statement for the bind zone might look like this:  zone "bind" chaos {     type master;     file "db.bind";     allow-query { localnets; }; };  On BIND 9, the configuration is a little more complicated. Even if you don’t explic- itly use views, BIND 9 creates zones in an implicit “default” view in the Internet class. So you can’t just create a CHAOSNET zone in the default view, because the zone and the view have different classes: you need to create a new CHAOSNET view  7.1 Concealing a Name Server’s Version    135  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   and define the bind zone in it. And, if you weren’t using views before, you need to create an explicit Internet view for your other zones and move their zone statements into the view.  For example, if your BIND 9 name server’s named.conf file looks like this now:  You might change it to look like this:  options {     directory " var named"; };  zone "foo.example" {     type master;     file "db.foo.example"; };  options {     directory " var named"; };  view internet in {      zone "foo.example" {         type master;         file "db.foo.example";     }; };  view chaosnet chaos {      zone "bind" {         type master;         file "db.bind";         allow-query { localnets; };     }; };  Discussion Camouflaging a name server’s version is no substitute for running an up-to-date ver- sion of BIND or for configuring the name server securely. About the best you can hope for is that concealing a name server’s version will prevent hackers from identifying it as an obvious, first-choice target if the version of BIND it’s running has a vulnerability.

Solution Configure your firewall to pass the UDP and TCP traffic that a BIND name server requires. This matrix shows you the traffic necessary for each purpose.  Purpose Queries from your name server Responses to your name server Queries from remote name servers Responses to remote name servers  Protocol UDP or TCP UDP or TCP UDP or TCP UDP or TCP  Source address Your name server Any Any Your name server  Source port > 1023 53 > 1023 53  Destination address Any Your name server Your name server Any  Destination port 53 > 1023 53 > 1023  Refresh queries—the queries a slave name server sends to its master name server to see if a zone’s serial number has increased—and NOTIFY messages are also sent from a high-numbered port  above 1023  to port 53.  Discussion Normally, BIND name servers choose a source port to use for outbound queries when they start, which means you must allow DNS messages from any unprivileged port. However, you can configure a name server to use a particular source port for outbound queries with the query-source options substatement.  On BIND 8 name servers, query-source also controls the source port for NOTIFY messages and refresh queries.  For example, to instruct a name server to use port 1053 as the source port for all outbound queries, use:  options {     directory " var named";     query-source address * port 1053; };  This may let you simplify the firewall rules somewhat, because you can limit out- bound, UDP-based query traffic to a single source port. If the name server has multiple network interfaces, you can also use the query-source substatement to choose which  7.2 Configuring a Name Server to Work with a Firewall  or Vice Versa     137  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   source address it uses in queries. For example, to tell a name server to use 192.168.0.1 as the source address in queries, use:  options {     directory " var named";     query-source address 192.168.0.1; };  You can specify both the source address and source port, too:  options {     directory " var named";     query-source address 192.168.0.1 port 1053; };  If you run a BIND 9 name server, use the transfer-source substatement in a zone, view or options statement to specify the source port used in refresh queries and forwarded dynamic updates. For example:  zone "foo.example" {     type slave;     masters { 192.168.0.1; };     file "bak.foo.example";     transfer-source * port 1053; };  This tells the name server to use port 1053 as the source for all refresh queries and dynamic updates it forwards. The port specification doesn’t apply to zone transfers, however, that use TCP; for TCP-based traffic, the source port is always chosen ran- domly. The address specification  here, “*”  does apply to the source address of TCP zone transfer requests, though.  On BIND 8 name servers, transfer-source is only a zone substatement until BIND 8.2.2, when it’s also supported as an options substatement. It only sets the source address used in zone transfers  that is, you can’t specify a port argument :  options {     directory " var named";     transfer-source 192.168.0.2; };  For NOTIFY messages, BIND 9.1.0 and later and BIND 8.3.2 and later name servers understand the notify-source substatement, which has the same argument syntax as transfer-source and can also be used as a zone, view, or options substatement.  Remember that queries can be TCP-based as well as UDP-based, so you must allow traffic from queriers to TCP port 53 as well as UDP port 53, and from your name server to TCP port 53.

All rights reserved.   7.3  Setting Up a Hidden Primary Master Name Server  Problem You want to run a primary master name server “hidden,” so that other name servers don’t query it.  Solution Configure the slave name servers for your zones to use the primary master as their master name server, but don’t list the primary master in the zones’ NS records. For example, if ns1.foo.example, at 192.168.0.1, is the primary master name server for foo.example, you’d add zone statements like these to the slaves’ named.conf files:  zone "foo.example" {     type slave;     masters { 192.168.0.1; };     file "bak.foo.example"; };  But the NS records for foo.example wouldn’t include ns1.foo.example:  foo.example.    IN    NS    ns2.foo.example. foo.example.    IN    NS    ns.isp.net.  In addition, make sure the delegation information for foo.example does not include ns1.foo.example.  Discussion “Hidden primary” configurations are often used to give the administrator of the pri- mary master name server direct control over zone data without incurring any of the zone’s query load. For example, a broadband Internet customer could run a local pri- mary master name server on which to administer the zone, but leave his ISP’s slaves to answer queries for data in the zone.  If you use Microsoft dynamic update clients, such as Windows 2000, be sure to list the real primary master name server in the MNAME field of the SOA records of dynamically updated zones. Microsoft dynamic update clients will send their updates to the name server designated in the MNAME field regardless of whether that name server also appears in the zone’s NS records.  Clients with BIND-based update code will only send updates to name servers listed in a zone’s NS records, so make sure your zones’ slave name servers support update forwarding  that is, run BIND name servers from 9.1.0 on  and have update forward- ing configured. See Recipe 3.11 for instructions on configuring update forwarding.  7.3 Setting Up a Hidden Primary Master Name Server    139  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   See Also Recipe 3.11, for configuring update forwarding.  7.4  Setting Up a Stealth Slave Name Server  Problem You want to set up a stealth slave name server, one that isn’t queried by remote name servers.  Solution Configure the name server as you would any other slave, but don’t include it in the NS records for the zone  or zones  it’s authoritative for.  Discussion A stealth slave name server is a close cousin of a hidden primary master. Like a hid- den primary, a stealth slave isn’t included in the NS records for the zone it’s authori- tative for. Other than that, though, it has the same configuration as any other slave name server for that zone.  The function of a stealth slave name server may not be as obvious as that of a hidden primary. A hidden primary’s benefit—making it possible to manage a zone without the burden of serving queries for the zone—doesn’t apply to a stealth slave. So what’s a stealth slave for?  Sometimes, you need another authoritative name server for a zone to serve some group of resolvers. Say you need a name server on a particular subnet, to serve the local resolvers. All of the subnet’s resolvers live in the same zone, so they’ll probably generate lots of queries for domain names in that zone. Shouldn’t their local name server be authoritative for the zone?  But what if you already have as many NS records for the zone as you can fit in a UDP- based DNS message  usually 10 or 11 ? Or what if you don’t want remote name serv- ers to query the new slave, because the subnet it’s on isn’t well-connected to the rest of the network? Just don’t list it in the zone’s NS records: remote name servers won’t fol- low delegation to it, but you can configure local resolvers to query it directly.  Since the slave isn’t in the list of NS records for the zone, the zone’s other authorita- tive name servers won’t send it NOTIFY messages by default. You’ll have to config- ure the stealth slave’s master name server to send it NOTIFY messages; for instructions, see Recipe 3.12.  140    Chapter 7: Security  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   See Also Recipe 3.12 for configuring the stealth slave’s master name server to send NOTIFY messages to the stealth slave.  7.5  Conﬁguring an Authoritative-Only Name Server  Problem You want to configure an “authoritative-only” or nonrecursive name server.  Solution Disable recursion with the recursion options substatement:  options {     directory " var named";     recursion no; };  If the name server isn’t already configured as authoritative for one or more zones, add zone statements to named.conf, too.  Discussion Since “authoritative-only” isn’t a standard term  nor is “nonrecursive,” really , a few words of explanation are in order. A nonrecursive or authoritative-only name server is one that only answers nonrecursive queries from remote name servers. It can’t directly serve resolvers, since all resolvers send recursive queries by default, but you can delegate zones to it, and it’s nearly invulnerable to spoofing attacks, since it nor- mally doesn’t send queries. It’s also more resistant to denial of service attacks, since it doesn’t process resource-intensive recursive queries.  For completeness, you may also want to disable glue fetching on BIND 8 name servers:  options {     directory " var named";     recursion no;     fetch-glue no; };  This step prevents the name server from sending queries to look up A records for name servers that appear in NS records. That, together with disabling recursion, makes the name server completely passive. It may prevent NOTIFY from working correctly, though, since the name server won’t look up the addresses of name servers  7.5 Configuring an Authoritative-Only Name Server    141  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   outside of the zones it’s authoritative for. In that case, use Recipe 3.13 to configure the name server to send NOTIFY messages to the slaves explicitly.  Remember to limit concurrent zone transfers  Recipe 5.16  and accept only autho- rized zone transfer requests  Recipe 7.10  if the name server acts as a master.  See Also Recipe 3.13, for explicit NOTIFY configuration; Recipe 5.16, to limit concurrent zone transfers; and Recipe 7.10, for adding zone transfer restrictions.  7.6  Conﬁguring a Caching-Only Name Server  Problem You want to configure a caching-only name server.  Solution Configure the name server with a root hints file  or, if you run BIND 9, use the built- in root hints  and restrict the queries it handles to the addresses of authorized resolv- ers using the allow-query options substatement. For example:  acl internal { 192.168.0 24; };  options {     directory " var named";     allow-query { internal; }; };  zone "." {     type hint;     file "db.cache"; };     The root hints are compiled into a BIND 9 name server, so this zone    statement is optional on those name servers  Discussion You may want to set up a caching-only name server as authoritative for some inter- nal zones, so that you can ensure that data in those zones is reliable. In this configu- ration, the name server will ignore records from your internal zones in answers from remote name servers, making it hard for a hacker to spoof data in those zones.  Since a caching-only name server’s main function is to query other name servers and cache the results, follow the instructions in Recipe 7.14 to protect against spoofing.  142    Chapter 7: Security  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   See Also Recipe 7.14 for instructions on protecting a name server from spoofing.  7.7  Running a Name Server in a chroot    Jail  Problem You want to run a name server in a chroot    jail, so that a hacker successfully break- ing in through the named process has limited access to the host’s filesystem.  Solution Set up an environment for the name server to chroot    into, then use named’s –t com- mand-line option to specify the name of the directory to chroot    to.  A BIND 9 chroot    environment, on most Unix systems, should include:    A working directory for the name server  which can be the chroot    directory    An etc subdirectory, which includes named.conf and the localtime file, copied  itself   from  etc localtime    A var run subdirectory for the name server’s PID file   A dev subdirectory, which may need to include the log, random, and zero devices  On my FreeBSD system, here’s how I set up the chroot    environment:   mkdir  etc namedb  cd  etc namedb  mkdir –p dev etc namedb var run etc namedb is the working directory  cp  etc localtime etc  mknod dev random c 2 3  mknod dev zero c 2 12  vi etc named.conf  To create the log device, I added the command-line option –a  etc namedb dev log to the startup of the syslog daemon. This tells syslogd to create an extra log device with the specified path  in the chroot    environment  and listen on it for logged messages.  Piece of cake!  Once you’ve set up the chroot    environment, start named with the –t command-line option, specifying the directory to chroot    to as the option’s argument. The first time you do it, check named’s syslog output for any startup errors caused by missing files or directories. Once named starts cleanly in the chroot    environment, add the –t option to your system’s startup scripts.  7.7 Running a Name Server in a chroot    Jail    143  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Discussion When running a name server in a chroot    environment, be sure to run as a non-root user, too. On many operating systems, a hacker gaining access to a process as root can break out of a chroot    jail. See Recipe 7.8 for instructions on running named as a non-root user.  BIND 8 name servers require a considerably more complicated chroot    environment, including a passwd file, shared libraries  unless you build BIND statically linked , and various device files, which is a good reason to recommend using BIND 9 in a chroot   d setup. If you insist on running a BIND 8 name server chroot   ed, see “Running BIND with Least Privilege” in Chapter 11 of DNS and BIND for instructions.  You can simplify the chroot    environment slightly by using the pid-file options sub- statement to tell named to create the PID file with a different pathname. For exam- ple, to create the PID file in the name server’s working directory, use:  options {     directory " var named";     pid-file "named.pid"; };  In fact, unless you use dynamically updated zones with DNSSEC, you can do with- out dev random in the chroot    environment, too. But then you’ll have to put up with named logging an error each time it starts.  See Also Recipe 1.20 for editing startup scripts, Recipe 7.8 for running BIND as a user other than root, and “Running BIND with Least Privilege” in Chapter 11 of DNS and BIND.  7.8  Running the Name Server as a User Other than Root  Problem You want to run a name server as a user other than root, so a hacker successfully breaking in through the named process doesn’t have access to the host as root.  Solution Add a passwd file entry for a new user; the only function of this file is to run the name server. Call this user something descriptive, such as bind or named. A passwd entry for a bind user might look like this:  bind:*:53:53:BIND name server: : bin nologin  144    Chapter 7: Security  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Optionally, add a group file entry for a new group, which this new user and any other users who are authorized to edit zone data file will belong to.  Adjust the ownership and permission of files and directories to make sure that this user  and group, if you created one  can:    Read, write and execute  search  named’s working directory   Read and write all zone data files   Write to the  var run directory  unless you’ve used the pid-file options substate-  ment to change the PID file’s path   Once you’ve modified the environment as needed, start named with the –u com- mand-line option, specifying as the option’s argument the name or user ID of the user to run as. The first time you do it, check named’s syslog output for any startup errors caused by permission problems. Once named starts cleanly, add the –u option to your system’s startup scripts.  Discussion Note that, as long as named is configured to listen on port 53, the default port, it must be started by root, since port 53 is a privileged port. The –u option simply tells it to give up root privilege as soon as it’s done what it needs to do as root.  As Recipe 7.7 says, name servers that run in a chroot    environment normally run as a non-root user, too, to prevent hackers from escaping the chroot    jail. BIND 8 name servers also support a –g command-line option to set the name server’s group ID. If –g isn’t specified, the name server changes group to the primary group of the user specified in the –u option. BIND 9 name servers don’t support –g, and always change group to the primary group of the user named in –u. On a BIND 8 name server, you may also need to change the group membership and permissions of the ndc Unix domain socket in order to allow users in the bind group to write to it.  See Also Recipe 1.20 for editing startup scripts, Recipe 7.7 for running a name server in a chroot    environment, and “Running BIND with Least Privilege” in Chapter 11 of DNS and BIND.  7.9  Deﬁning a TSIG Key  Problem You want to define a TSIG key for use in authenticating remote name servers and dynamic updaters.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  7.9 Defining a TSIG Key    145   Solution Add a key statement to the name server’s named.conf file defining the new TSIG key. For example:  key dhcp-server.foo.example {     algorithm hmac-md5;     secret "OqprPEyzGITP0T7FcES7Wg=="; };  The first argument is the name of the key—in this case, dhcp-server.foo.example. The key is often named after one or both of the hosts that use it. The algorithm substate- ment specifies the cryptographic algorithm the key is used with; for TSIG, it is always hmac-md5. The secret is the base 64 encoding of the binary TSIG key.  You can generate the key with dnssec-keygen or dnskeygen, programs included in the BIND 9 and BIND 8 distributions, respectively. To generate the key above, I used the command:  $ dnssec-keygen –a HMAC-MD5 –b 128 –n HOST dhcp-server.foo.example Kdhcp-server.foo.example.+157+19185  The argument to the –a  “algorithm”  option specified the cryptographic algorithm as HMAC-MD5, while the argument to –b  “bit length”  specified the length of the key to generate, in bits. The –n  “nametype”  option specified this key as a host key, and the only non-option argument specified the name of the key. The program then printed a string to standard output  Kdhcp-server.foo.example.+157+19185  that identified the name of a file it wrote the key to.  The name of the file is actually that string with “.key” appended.  The file contained:  dhcp-server.foo.example. IN KEY 512 3 157 OqprPEyzGITP0T7FcES7Wg==  The last field is the base 64 encoding of the random, 128-bit key it generated.  The key statement should be identical—including both the name of the key and the secret—in the named.conf file of both name servers  or the name server and updater  that will use it.  Discussion Defining a TSIG key doesn’t do anything useful by itself; it just makes the key avail- able for the name server to use. The key still needs to be applied to some security mechanism, as in an allow-transfer substatement  Recipe 7.10 .  It’s safest to define unique TSIG keys for use between any two name servers, so that the compromise of one TSIG key doesn’t cause a broader security failure.  The maximum length of a TSIG key is 512 bits. Longer keys are harder to break, but 128 bits should be ample for all but the most paranoid administrators.  146    Chapter 7: Security  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   dnskeygen takes very similar arguments to dnssec-keygen; check the manual page for details. And if you can’t figure out how to use dnskeygen, you can always build dnssec-keygen and use it to generate TSIG keys for your BIND 8 name server.  TSIG requires time synchronization between the name servers or the name server and updater that will use it. Getting the clocks within about five minutes of each other is all that’s necessary, though. You can do that with any respectable time syn- chronization service, from rdate to NTP.  See Also Recipe 3.10, for securing dynamic updates with TSIG, and Recipe 7.10, for securing zone transfers using TSIG.  7.10 Securing Zone Transfers  Problem You want to secure zone transfers from a name server.  Solution Use the allow-transfer substatement to specify the addresses of slave name servers allowed to transfer zones. Or, even better, define a TSIG key on the master and slave name servers  see Recipe 7.9 , and specify the TSIG key in the allow-transfer sub- statement.  allow-transfer can be used as either an options substatement or as a zone substate- ment. As a zone substatement, allow-transfer applies only to transfers of that zone, and overrides any allow-transfer options substatement for transfers of that zone.  For example, to restrict transfers of the zone foo.example to the slave name server at 192.168.0.2, you might use this zone statement:  zone "foo.example" {     type master;     file "db.foo.example";     allow-transfer { 192.168.0.2; }; };  To restrict transfers of all authoritative zones to slave name servers signing their requests with the TSIG key ns1-ns2.foo.example, you might use the following options statement:  options {     directory " var named";     allow-transfer { key ns1-ns2.foo.example; }; };  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  7.10 Securing Zone Transfers    147   The keyword key is necessary to distinguish the name of the TSIG key from a named ACL.  Obviously, the slave doesn’t need any special configuration to initiate its zone trans- fers from its own address, but it does require configuration to tell it to sign requests with a particular TSIG key. To tell a slave to sign all zone transfer requests to the name server at 192.168.0.1 with the key ns1-ns2.foo.example, you could add the fol- lowing server statement to named.conf:  server 192.168.0.1 {     keys ns1-ns2.foo.example; };  Discussion For readability’s sake, consider defining ACLs with descriptive names even when you’re only using IP addresses in your allow-transfer substatements. For example, you could rewrite the zone statement above like so:  acl ns2.foo.example { 192.168.0.2; };  zone "foo.example" {     type master;     file "db.foo.example";     allow-transfer { ns2.foo.example; }; };  Isn’t that better?  You can mix IP addresses and TSIG keys in an allow-transfer substatement, too, in which case the individual elements or logically OR’d together.  Restricting zone transfers to a slave name server by both a TSIG key and the slave’s address is more difficult than you might imagine. First, define an ACL that matches all IP addresses except the address of the slave:  acl not-ns2.foo.example { !192.168.0.2; any; };  Use the negation of this ACL as the first term of the argument to allow-transfer, and the TSIG key as the second:  options {     directory " var named";     allow-transfer { !not-ns2.foo.example; key ns1-ns2.foo.example; }; };  The negation operator in the first term tells the name server to deny zone transfers from addresses that match the negated ACL, not-ns2.foo.example, and the negated ACL matches every address but that of the slave. In other words, the first term denies all addresses but the address of the slave. The next term guarantees that only requests from the slave that are signed with the specified TSIG key are permitted; any other requests from the address of the slave are implicitly denied.  148    Chapter 7: Security  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Finally, remember that a BIND name server’s default is to allow transfers of any zone, so you’ll need to deny all transfers on slave name servers that don’t serve any other slaves with:  allow-transfer { none; };  See Also Recipe 7.9 for instructions on defining TSIG keys and “Preventing Unauthorized Zone Transfers” in Chapter 11 of DNS and BIND.  7.11 Restricting the Queries a Name Server  Answers  Problem You want to restrict the queries a name server answers.  Solution Use the allow-query substatement to restrict the queries to which the name server responds. allow-query can be used as either an options substatement or a zone sub- statement. As an options substatement, it determines which addresses the name server will reply to for queries in any zone. Used as a zone substatement, allow-query controls which queriers can look up records in that zone, and overrides any epony- mous options substatement.  This allow-query substatement allows only queriers  resolvers and name servers  on local networks to look up arbitrary domain names:  The localnets ACL is predefined by BIND as all of the networks to which the host that runs the name server is directly connected.  In the same named.conf file, this allow-query substatement allows anyone to look up domain names in the bar.example zone:  options {     directory " var named";     allow-query { localnets; }; };  zone "bar.example" {     type slave;     masters { 10.0.0.1; };     file "bak.bar.example";     allow-query { any; }; };  7.11 Restricting the Queries a Name Server Answers    149  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   This particular combination of allow-query substatements is useful on name servers that serve some group of local resolvers that you can identify by IP address, but also have one or more zones delegated to them.  You can also control which addresses are allowed to send recursive queries with the allow-recursion options substatement, supported in BIND 8.2.1 and later. Only que- riers in the specified address match list will have their queries processed recursively; all other queries and treated as nonrecursive. For example:  options {     directory " var named";     allow-recursion { localnets; }; };  Discussion If you’re faced with the choice of using multiple allow-query substatements or a sin- gle allow-recursion substatement to protect a name server from unauthorized que- ries, you should be aware of an important corner case: name servers authoritative for a zone that contains delegation may receive legitimate queries from remote name servers for data in subzones. The combination of allow-query options and zone sub- statements described earlier won’t permit these queries, since the queries are received from nonlocal addresses for data outside of the name server’s authoritative zones. allow-recursion works fine, though; you can permit recursive queries only from local networks and allow nonrecursive queries from anywhere.  Though you can specify TSIG keys with the allow-query substatement, there’s usu- ally not much point in doing so, since resolvers don’t sign queries. Other name serv- ers can, though.  See Also “Restricting Queries” in Chapter 11 of DNS and BIND.  7.12 Preventing a Name Server from Querying  a Particular Remote Name Server  Problem You want to keep a name server from querying a particular remote name server.  150    Chapter 7: Security  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Solution Add a server statement to the name server’s named.conf file, specifying the remote name server’s IP address, with a bogus substatement telling the name server not to query it. For example:  server 192.168.0.255 {     bogus yes; };  Discussion This feature isn’t used much on production name servers, perhaps because there aren’t many remote name servers that are known to be under the influence of evil organizations bent on world domination, à la SMERSH or SPECTRE. But it can come in handy if you know that a particular name server is misbehaving.  If you do add a server statement to keep a name server from speaking to a remote name server, remember to check back periodically to see if the remote name server is still suffering from whatever dyspepsia is causing it to belch forth unpleasantness.  See Also “Avoiding a Bogus Name Server” in Chapter 10 of DNS and BIND.  7.13 Preventing a Name Server from Responding  to DNS Trafﬁc from Certain Networks  Problem You want to prevent a name server from responding to any DNS traffic—queries, NOTIFY messages, dynamic updates—from certain networks.  Solution List the networks in the blackhole options substatement. Any traffic the name server receives from addresses on these networks will be ignored. For example, this blackhole substatement tells the name server not to respond to queries from RFC 1918 address space:  options {     directory " var named";     blackhole {         10 8; 172.16 12; 192.168 16;     }; };  7.13 Preventing a Name Server from Responding to DNS Traffic from Certain Networks    151  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   You might want to configure an external name server like this, to prevent it from wasting time replying to queries from private address space. Of course, this solution assumes that you don’t use these networks internally.  Discussion The difference between blackhole and allow-query is that a name server replies to a querier blocked by allow-query with a message indicating that its query was refused, while a name server doesn’t respond at all to a querier in a list of blackholed networks.  There’s a surprisingly long list of networks that name servers shouldn’t respond to traffic from, because they correspond to experimental, multicast, or private address space. The excellent “Secure BIND Template,” maintained by Rob Thomas, con- tains a blackhole substatement that includes a list of these networks.  If you go to the trouble of setting up such a complete blackhole substatement for your name servers, though, you may also want to consider configuring your border router to drop all traffic from those networks. This will protect all of your network services, not just DNS.  See Also “Avoiding a Bogus Name Server” in Chapter 10 of DNS and BIND; and “The Secure BIND Template,” which you can find at http:  www.cymru.com ~robt Docs Articles  secure-bind-template.html.  7.14 Protecting a Name Server from Spooﬁng  Problem You want to protect a name server from spoofing attacks.  Solution On a BIND 8.2 or later name server, set the use-id-pool options substatement to yes. This tells the name server to use better, optional randomization routines to choose message IDs for the header of DNS queries. This makes the message IDs harder to guess, and, therefore, it is more difficult to spoof a response to those queries.  On a BIND 9 name server, you don’t need use-id-pool since the better randomization rou- tines are now standard.   Also, use the allow-recursion options substatement, as described in Recipe 7.11, to restrict which networks the name server will accept recursive queries from. If it doesn’t accept recursive queries from arbitrary addresses on the Internet, hackers will  152    Chapter 7: Security  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   find it harder to induce the name server to query name servers under their control and thereby poison its cache.  Finally, you might use the technique introduced in Recipe 7.6, configuring the name server as authoritative for important internal zones. The name server will ignore records from your internal zones in answers from remote name servers, making it hard for a hacker to spoof data in those zones.  Discussion If the name server doesn’t serve any recursive queriers, of course, configure it as authoritative-only name server, as described in Recipe 7.5.  See Also Recipe 7.6 for loading internal zones and Recipe 7.11 for use of the allow-recursion substatement, or Recipe 7.5 for configuring an authoritative-only name server.  7.14 Protecting a Name Server from Spoofing    153  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   CHAPTER 8 Chapter 8 Interoperability and Upgrading  Introduction  8.0 Not all name servers run BIND. And, much as it may disappoint the authors of the various RFCs that standardize the DNS protocol, some of these non-catholic name servers don’t interoperate with BIND name servers. With a little administrative arm- twisting, however, you can usually coax BIND and the alien name servers into a DNS détente. Recipes 8.3 through 8.5 cover this kind of diplomacy.  If you’re a conscientious administrator, you’ll upgrade your name servers when new versions are released, to close vulnerabilities and take advantage of new features. If you’re making a big jump, from BIND 4 or BIND 8 to a newer release, Recipes 8.1 and 8.2 give helpful hints.  Finally, newer Windows operating systems use DNS for much more than mundane web browsing. Windows 2000 and XP computers use dynamic update to register their name-to-address and address-to-name mappings, and Domain Controllers use updates to add SRV records advertising the services they offer. While Microsoft made it easiest to serve these clients with the Microsoft DNS Server, BIND name servers are flexible enough to accommodate them, too. See Recipes 8.7 and 8.8 for details.  8.1  Upgrading from BIND 4 to BIND 8 or 9  Problem You want to upgrade a name server from BIND 4 to BIND 8 or 9.  Solution Convert the name server’s named.boot file into an equivalent named.conf file using named-bootconf.sh or manually, if you prefer. You can find named-bootconf.sh in  154  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   BIND 9’s contrib named-bootconf directory, or in BIND 8’s bin named-bootconf directory. named-bootconf reads a file in named.boot format from standard input and writes a functionally equivalent named.conf file to standard output. So, for example, you could run it like this:  $ named-bootconf.sh   named.conf  If you’re upgrading to a version of BIND more recent than BIND 8.2, you’ll also need to add a $TTL control statement to each of your zone data files. See Recipe 2.1 for an explanation of the $TTL control statement.  BIND 8 and 9 both have stricter rules governing the contents of a zone than BIND 4. For example, BIND 4 allowed you to attach multiple CNAME records to a single domain name; BIND 8 and 9 don’t, by default. BIND 4 allowed you to attach a CNAME record and other record types to a single domain name; BIND 8 and 9 don’t. It’s a good idea to either use BIND 9’s named-checkzone program  Recipe 5.2  to check the zone before loading it or examine the upgraded name server’s syslog output closely after starting it.  BIND 4 name servers also send all UDP traffic from port 53, whereas newer name servers use a random source port. After upgrading, you may need to adjust firewall rules or configure the name server to use port 53 as its source port  Recipe 7.2 .  Discussion Arguably more important than any of this is that the newest BIND 8 and 9 name servers fix many bugs and vulnerabilities, and support many new security features. Take a look at Chapter 7 to get an idea of how you can secure a brand-spanking new name server.  If you still have BIND 4 name servers running as slaves to this name server, see Rec- ipe 8.3 for instructions on how to accommodate the older name servers.  See Also Recipe 2.1 for coverage of the $TTL control statement, Recipe 5.2 for how to drive named-checkzone, and Recipe 7.2 for the getting a BIND name server to work with a firewall.  8.2  Upgrading from BIND 8 to BIND 9  Problem You want to upgrade a name server from BIND 8 to BIND 9.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  8.2 Upgrading from BIND 8 to BIND 9    155   Solution The good news is that BIND 9’s configuration file format is the same as BIND 8’s, so you won’t need to convert your old named.conf file. However, BIND 9 name servers don’t support some configuration options that BIND 8 name servers support. For a list, see the file doc misc options in the BIND 9 distribution. Options marked as “obsolete” or “not [yet] implemented” aren’t supported. In most cases, you either won’t need the old option or can make do with functionality provided by a newer option.  One major change in the configuration file is the controls statement. BIND 8 name servers support both inet and unix control channels  see Recipe 3.1 . BIND 9, how- ever, only supports a new type of inet control channel, so you’ll probably need to mod- ify the name server’s controls statement and create an rndc.conf file, per Recipe 3.2.  The zone data file format is also the same in BIND 8 and BIND 9. However, if you’re upgrading from a version of BIND older than 8.2 to BIND 9, you’ll need to add $TTL control statements to your zone data files, as described in Recipe 8.1.  There are aspects of the name server’s operation that change in BIND 9. For exam- ple, BIND 8 name servers will start even if there are  minor  syntax errors in the named.conf file. A BIND 9 name server won’t. This forces you to fix any syntax errors before the name server will start, which is probably a good thing.  BIND 8 name servers will also load zone data files even if they contain  minor  errors. A BIND 9 name server won’t. Again, this forces you to fix any errors in the data file before the name server will respond to any queries in the zone.  BIND 9 uses different logging categories than BIND 8 did, so if the name server’s named.conf file includes a logging statement, you may need to modify it for use with BIND 9. For example, BIND 8 name servers log all messages not assigned to a cate- gory to the default category, whereas BIND 9 name servers log such messages to the general category. See “Category Details” in Chapter 7 of DNS and BIND for a list of all BIND 9 categories and how they correspond to BIND 8’s categories.  Finally, BIND 9 name servers don’t check whether domain names contain “valid” characters, so the check-names substatement doesn’t work.  Discussion Although it may not affect the name server you’re upgrading, the default format BIND 9 uses for sending zone transfers is the many-answers format. BIND 8 name servers understand many-answers zone transfers, though they send one-answers zone transfers by default. If you have older slave name servers that don’t speak many- answers, see Recipes 8.3 and 8.4 for instructions on configuring a BIND 9 name server to speak their language.  156    Chapter 8:  Interoperability and Upgrading  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   In a BIND 8 name server’s named.conf file, you could add a zone statement of a non- IN class anywhere. In BIND 9, however, you must add non-IN zone statements to a non-IN view. That means using views and moving all zone statements into view statements, whether or not you have any other use for views. Recipe 7.1 shows an example of this.  For a more complete reckoning of the changes between BIND 8 and BIND 9 name servers, see the file doc misc migration in the BIND 9 distribution.  See Also Recipes 3.1 and 3.2 for the differences in the syntax of the controls statement in BIND 8 and 9, Recipes 8.3 and 8.4 for instructions on serving old-style, one-answer zone transfers to BIND 4 name servers, Recipe 7.1 for an example of setting up a non-IN class view, and the “Category Details” section of Chapter 7 of DNS and BIND for lists of categories supported by BIND 8 and BIND 9 name servers.  8.3  Configuring a Name Server to Accommodate a Slave Running BIND 4  Problem You need to configure a name server to accommodate a BIND 4 slave.  Solution On a BIND 9 name server, you may need to configure the name server to send old- style, one-answer zone transfers to the slave. Add a server statement specifying the slave’s address, and use the transfer-format substatement to set the transfer format to one-answer:  server 192.168.0.2 {     transfer-format one-answer; };  BIND 8 name servers send one-answer zone transfers by default, so there’s no need to add a server statement especially for a BIND 4 slave—unless you’ve changed the default in a transfer-format options substatement.  You’ll also need to avoid adding resource records to zones that were introduced after the version of BIND that the slave runs. In particular, watch out for SRV records, introduced in BIND 4.9.5.  8.3 Configuring a Name Server to Accommodate a Slave Running BIND 4    157  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Discussion Since the ISC has deprecated the use of any version of BIND 4, you should also prod the administrator of the BIND 4 slave to upgrade.  See Also “More efficient zone transfers” in Chapter 10 of DNS and BIND, and the ISC’s BIND pages, at http:  www.isc.org products BIND , for recommended versions of BIND.  8.4  Conﬁguring a BIND Name Server to Accommodate a Slave Running the Microsoft DNS Server  Problem You need to configure a BIND name server to accommodate a slave running the Microsoft DNS Server.  Solution Although the version of the Microsoft DNS Server that shipped with Windows 2000 Server nominally supports many-answers zone transfers, some versions have trouble with DNS messages larger than 16K—exactly the kind a many-answers zone transfer might include. If you’re running a BIND 9 name server, which sends many-answers zone transfers by default, you may need to add a server statement telling the name server to send one-answer zone transfers to the Microsoft DNS Server. For example:  server 10.0.0.1 {     transfer-format one-answer; };  Also, the Microsoft DNS Server doesn’t handle some record types, including A6, DNAME, and all DNSSEC-related records  KEY, SIG and NXT , so make sure you don’t add those to the zone.  Discussion Unfortunately, transfers to the Microsoft DNS Server fail nearly silently if the zone contains these record types, making it difficult for the administrator to diagnose.  158    Chapter 8:  Interoperability and Upgrading  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   See Also Section 3.2 of the file doc misc migration in the BIND 9 distribution.  8.5  Conﬁguring a BIND Name Server as a Slave to a Microsoft DNS Server  Problem You want to configure a BIND name server as a slave to a Microsoft DNS Server.  Solution Configure the BIND name server as a slave for the zones you want to load from the Microsoft DNS Server, using the Microsoft DNS Server’s address in the zones’ masters substatements.  On the Microsoft DNS Server, make sure the name server doesn’t include WINS or WINS-R records in zone transfers to your BIND slave.  You’re adding a WINS record when you configure a Microsoft DNS Server to look up names using a WINS server if it can’t find them in a zone, and a WINS-R record when you configure the name server to use a NETBIOS query to help with reverse mapping.  These records are included in zone transfers unless you check the Do not replicate this record check- box on the WINS tab of the zone’s Properties window in the DNS Console  for Win- dows 2000  or the Settings only affect local server checkbox on the WINS Lookup tab of the zone’s Properties window in DNS Manager  for Windows NT 4.0 .  Discussion Remember to ask the administrator of the zone to add an NS record for the name server, assuming you want remote name servers to query it. If you don’t want the name server listed in an NS record, you can still ask the administrator to configure his Microsoft DNS Server to send your name server NOTIFY messages for the slave zones.

All rights reserved.   8.6  Preventing Windows Computers from Trying to Update Your Zones  Problem You want to prevent computers running Windows 2000 and XP from trying to dynamically update your zones.  Solution On the Windows computer, go to Start ➝ Settings ➝ Network and Dial-up Connections. For each network interface, right-click on the name of the interface and choose Properties. In the Properties window, double-click on Internet Protocol  TCP IP . In the Internet Protocol  TCP IP  Properties window, click on Advanced…. Finally, in the Advanced TCP IP Settings window, click on the DNS tab. Uncheck Register this connection’s addresses in DNS and click OK.  If you prefer to monkey around with the Registry, you can accomplish the same thing for all interfaces by adding a REG_DWORD value called DisableDynamicUpdate, with a value of 1, to the Registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\ Services\Tcpip\Parameters\ Interfaces.  Discussion Computers running Windows 2000 and XP, by default, try to register their name-to- address and address-to-name mappings using dynamic update.  Well, that’s not completely true: DHCP clients register their name-to-address mappings, but their DHCP servers normally add the address-to-name mappings.  Of course, unless you expressly allow such updates by adding an allow-update substatement to your zone statements, your name server will deny those updates. However, you may get sick of seeing errors like these in syslog:  Jun  5 13:56:07 ns1 named[50684]: error: client 192.168.0.2543181: update foo. example IN' denied  These messages are logged to the security category, and you certainly don’t want to discard all security-related messages, so it’s important to know how to stop the updates at their source.  In BIND 9.3.0, those messages are in the update-security category, so you can send those messages to the null channel without missing more important security-rele- vant messages.  160    Chapter 8:  Interoperability and Upgrading  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   See Also Recipe 8.7, in case you want to do something productive with those dynamic updates.  8.7  Handling Windows Registration with a BIND Name Server  Problem You want to allow your computers running Windows 2000 and XP to register using dynamic update.  Solution There are several techniques for dealing with Windows computers’ desire to register their name-to-address and address-to-name mappings, but one of the most popular is to create a special subzone just for the computers to register in. If your main for- ward-mapping zone is corp.example, you might create a dyn.corp.example subzone for the Windows computers to live in. The name servers for dyn.corp.example don’t need to be different from the name servers that serve corp.example; what’s impor- tant is that the zones are separate. This lets you allow dynamic updates to one while keeping the other static.  The delegation for dyn.corp.example in the corp.example zone might look like this:  dyn.corp.example.    IN    NS    ns1.corp.example. dyn.corp.example.    IN    NS    ns2.corp.example.  dyn.corp.example could begin life as a minimal zone, with just an SOA record and NS records: $TTL 1d @    IN    SOA    ns1.corp.example.    hostmaster.corp.example.           2002061900      1h      15m      30d      1h        IN    NS    ns1.corp.example.      IN    NS    ns2.corp.example.  Over time, of course, computers running Windows will register themselves and “fill out” the contents of the zone.  The name servers for dyn.corp.example must allow dynamic updates from the addresses of any Windows computers that might register. For example:  acl dhcp-clients { 192.168.0.128 25; }; acl static-clients { 192.168.0.64 26; };  8.7 Handling Windows Registration with a BIND Name Server    161  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   zone "dyn.corp.example" {     type master;     file "db.dyn.corp.example";     allow-update { dhcp-clients; static-clients; }; };  Finally, the Windows computers must be configured with dyn.corp.example as their primary DNS suffix, Microsoft’s term for a local domain name. Go to My Computer ➝ Properties ➝ Network Identification ➝ Properties ➝ More… Enter dyn.corp.example in the field labeled Primary DNS Suffix. If the local domain name is different from the name of the Windows domain the computer is part of, uncheck Change primary DNS Suffix if domain Membership Changes checkbox before setting it.  Discussion All this work is necessary because allowing dynamic updates to your main forward- mapping zone from just any old computer running Windows 2000 or XP is a bad idea. One of those users could easily download a copy of BIND, precompiled for Windows computers, and use nsupdate to modify the zone. And with unsigned dynamic updates—the only kind that currently work between Windows computers and BIND name servers—there are no restrictions to what he could change in the zone. By cordoning off the Windows computers in their own zone, they can only hurt each other.  If you’re not comfortable with the idea of allowing dynamic updates to a subzone from all of your Windows machines, you might consider using DHCP to assign their addresses—even the addresses of statically addressed hosts—and configuring the DHCP server to assume responsibility for updating its clients’ forward- and reverse- mapping information. Most modern DHCP servers support this. With this configu- ration, you can allow dynamic updates only from the address of your DHCP server. You can also restrict dynamic updates to your reverse-mapping zones to just your DHCP server, which helps minimize the threat to those zones. See Recipe 8.9 for instructions on configuring one DHCP server, the ISC’s, to update a forward- and reverse-mapping zone.

All rights reserved.   8.8  Handling Active Directory with a Name Server  Problem You want to allow your Active Directory Domain Controllers to register their SRV records using dynamic update.  Solution As with Recipe 8.7, there are a number of different solutions to this problem, but this is probably the most popular. If your Windows domain has the same name as an existing zone in DNS, create subzones with the names:    _msdcs.name-of-Windows-2000-domain   _sites.name-of-Windows-2000-domain   _tcp.name-of-Windows-2000-domain   _udp.name-of-Windows-2000-domain  For example, if both the name of your Windows domain and the domain name of your main forward-mapping zone were corp.example, you would create zones called _msdcs.corp.example, _sites.corp.example, _tcp.corp.example, and _udp.corp.example. You don’t need separate name servers for these zones; they can be the same as the corp.example name servers:  _msdcs.corp.example.    IN    NS    ns1.corp.example. _msdcs.corp.example.    IN    NS    ns2.corp.example.  _sites.corp.example.    IN    NS    ns1.corp.example. _sites.corp.example.    IN    NS    ns2.corp.example.  _tcp.corp.example.      IN    NS    ns1.corp.example. _tcp.corp.example.      IN    NS    ns2.corp.example.  _udp.corp.example.      IN    NS    ns1.corp.example. _udp.corp.example.      IN    NS    ns2.corp.example.  Like the special subzone for Windows hosts to register in, these zones can start as minimal zones:  $TTL 1d @    IN    SOA    ns1.corp.example.    hostmaster.corp.example.           2002061900      1h      15m      30d      1h        IN    NS    ns1.corp.example.      IN    NS    ns2.corp.example.  8.8 Handling Active Directory with a Name Server    163  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   However, we only need to permit dynamic updates to these zones that come from our Domain Controllers:  acl domain-controllers { 192.168.0.100; 192.168.0.200; };  zone "_msdcs.corp.example" {     type master;     file "db._msdcs.corp.example";     allow-update { domain-controllers; }; };  zone "_sites.corp.example" {     type master;     file "db._sites.corp.example";     allow-update { domain-controllers; }; };  zone "_tcp.corp.example" {     type master;     file "db._tcp.corp.example";     allow-update { domain-controllers; }; };  zone "_udp.corp.example" {     type master;     file "db._udp.corp.example";     allow-update { domain-controllers; }; };  Discussion The reason we can’t allow dynamic updates to our main forward-mapping zone from our Domain Controllers is that it gives them too much control over the contents of the zone: someone could easily send—or spoof—dynamic updates from a Domain Con- troller and modify the zone. Instead, we create special subzones for the Domain Controllers to update. Since the domain names of the records they add usually end in _msdcs.corp.example, _sites.corp.example, _tcp.corp.example, or _udp.corp.example, the updates will modify the subzones, not their parent zone.  Domain Controllers do try to register two records that can cause problems, though: an A record attached to the domain name that matches the name of the Windows domain, and an A record in the _msdcs subdomain that has an underscore in the domain name.  All of the SRV records that Domain Controllers add have under- scores in their domain names, but nearly all name servers allow that. BIND 8 name servers, by default, will complain about underscores in the owner of an A record, however.  To prevent the Domain Controller from trying to add these two records, change the value of the following Registry key to zero on the Domain Controllers:  164    Chapter 8:  Interoperability and Upgrading  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Solution Within the dhcpd.conf file, add a ddns-domainname statement and a ddns-rev- domainname statement, if necessary. These define the name of the forward-mapping zone to add A records to and the suffix to append to inverted addresses to form the owner names of PTR records to add, respectively. The default ddns-rev-domainname is, naturally, in-addr.arpa. Here’s an example:  ddns-domainname "foo.example"; ddns-rev-domainname "in-addr.arpa";  Next, add statements to specify the update style and whether the DHCP server should allow clients to update their own A records, if they wish. The recommended update style is “interim”, which is described in this recipe. If you also want the DHCP server to handle all dynamic updates, add these statements:  ddns-update-style interim; ignore client-updates;  Then define a TSIG key to use to sign updates. The syntax of the key statement is nearly identical to that used in the like-named statement in named.conf. Here’s an example key statement:  key dhcp-server.foo.example. {         algorithm hmac-md5;         secret "R2xOu1NWXSPkvNqfP8Rm6Q=="; }  Note that there’s no semicolon at the end of the statement  after “}” .  8.9 Configuring a DHCP Server to Update a BIND Name Server    165  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Finally, add zone statements telling the DHCP server the domain names of the zones it will update, and for each of these, the address of the name server to send updates to and the TSIG key to sign those updates with. For example:  zone foo.example. {         primary 127.0.0.1;         key dhcp-server.foo.example.; }  zone 0.168.192.in-addr.arpa. {         primary 127.0.0.1;         key dhcp-server.foo.example.; }  Again, there’s no semicolon at the end of the statement.  In this case, the DHCP server and the primary master name server for foo.example and 0.168.192.in-addr.arpa—the zones the DHCP server needs to update—are run- ning on the same host, so I specified the loopback address.  On the name server’s side, use the newfangled update-policy zone substatement to limit which records the DHCP server’s TSIG key can update. All the DHCP server should update in foo.example are A and TXT records, and never for the domain name of the zone. In the 0.168.192.in-addr.arpa zone, the DHCP server should only update PTR records. These zone statements enforce those restrictions:  zone "foo.example" {     type master;     file "db.foo.example";     update-policy {         grant dhcp-server.foo.example. wildcard *.nxdomain.com. A TXT;     }; };  zone "0.168.192.in-addr.arpa" {     type master;     file "db.192.168.0";     update-policy {         grant dhcp-server.foo.example. wildcard *.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa. PTR;     }; };  For more information on update-policy, see Recipe 3.10.  Discussion The 3.0 version of the ISC DHCP server supports sending dynamic updates. You can get a copy from http:  www.isc.org products DHCP .  When ignoring client updates, the DHCP server determines the domain name of the DHCP client by concatenating the first label of the domain name the client specifies in the FQDN option with the setting for the ddns-domainname.  166    Chapter 8:  Interoperability and Upgrading  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   The DHCP server needs to add TXT RRs to the forward-mapping zone because they’re part of a clever mechanism it uses to avoid name collisions. When the DHCP initially adds an A record for a DHCP client, it computes a unique hash value for that client, based on the client’s MAC address and other parameters. Then, it adds not just the A record to the client’s domain name, but also a TXT record that contains the hash value.  Whenever the DHCP server needs to update a domain name’s A record, it sets as a prerequisite that the domain name own a TXT record that matches the client’s calcu- lated hash value. If a TXT records exists with a different hash value, then another DHCP client is already using the same domain name.  See Also dhcpd.conf 5 , for more information on the syntax of dhcpd.conf and of the DHCP server’s support for dynamic update; Recipe 3.10, for an explanation of update-policy.  8.9 Configuring a DHCP Server to Update a BIND Name Server    167  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   CHAPTER 9 Chapter 9 Resolvers and Programming  search  nameserver  sortlist  options  Introduction  9.0 Resolvers are considerably easier to configure than name servers. A BIND resolver supports just a few configuration directives: domain  Sets the resolver’s local domain name  Sets the resolver’s search list and, implicitly, the local domain name  Configures the resolver to query a remote name server  Configures the resolver to sort certain A records to the beginning of responses  Controls miscellaneous aspects of the resolver’s configuration, such as timeouts  Windows resolvers support configuration of a similar set of parameters: at least the local domain name, search list, and remote name servers to query. This chapter includes recipes for configuring each of these aspects of a resolver’s behavior, for both BIND and Windows resolvers. It also includes several sample programs that demonstrate how to use the invaluable Net::DNS module to send queries, request zone transfers, and send dynamic updates from a Perl program.  9.1  Conﬁguring a Resolver to Query a Remote Name Server  Problem You want to configure a resolver to query a name server running on a particular remote host.  168  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Solution On a host running a BIND resolver, add a nameserver directive to the resolv.conf file. The resolv.conf file  note that there’s no “e” on the end of “resolv”  usually lives in the  etc directory; if it doesn’t exist, create one with your favorite editor. Specify the address of the remote name server as the single argument to the nameserver direc- tive. For example:  nameserver 192.168.0.1  You may also want to designate one or more name servers for the resolver to query if the first one doesn’t respond, or if there’s some error in sending the query to the first name server. To specify a backup name server, just add another nameserver directive with the backup name server’s address as its argument:  nameserver 192.168.0.1 nameserver 192.168.0.2  The resolver queries the name servers in the order you list them in resolv.conf. For a Windows resolver, find the resolver configuration window. On Windows 2000, for example, you can bring up the resolver configuration window by choosing Start ➝ Settings ➝ Control Panel ➝ Network and Dial-up Connections. Right-click on the name of your network connection, select Properties, then double-click on Internet Protocol  TCP IP  Properties. Check the box labeled Use the following DNS server addresses and fill in the address of the remote name server in the field labeled Preferred DNS server. Specify a backup name server, if you like, in the Alternate DNS server field.  Discussion Configuring a resolver to use a backup name server is a good idea, since without a backup, a single name server’s failure will cripple the resolver. Resolvers send recursive queries by default, so make sure that the name server you configure a resolver to query will accept recursive queries from it.  See Also “The nameserver Directive” and “Windows 2000” in Chapter 6 of DNS and BIND; “Name Servers to Query” in Chapter 6 of DNS on Windows 2000..  9.2  Conﬁguring a Resolver to Resolve Single-Label Domain Names  Problem You want to configure a resolver so that it can resolve single-label domain names.  9.2 Configuring a Resolver to Resolve Single-Label Domain Names    169  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Solution For a BIND resolver, configure the resolver’s local domain name by adding a domain directive to resolv.conf. Specify the local domain name as the single argument to domain. For example:  domain foo.example  Now, when you use single-label domain names as arguments, the resolver will append the local domain name before looking them up.  With a Windows resolver, find the resolver configuration window and set the Domain  in Windows 95 or 98  or the Primary DNS Suffix  in Windows 2000 and Windows XP . To get to the right window in Windows 2000, right-click on My Computer and choose Properties ➝ Network Identification ➝ Properties.  Discussion On most Unixish operating systems, setting the local domain name also determines how the OS interprets names that appear in system files, such as .rhosts and hosts.equiv. Single-label names in those files are assumed to end in the local domain name.  If you want to specify more than one domain name to append to domain name argu- ments, configure the resolver’s search list, as shown in Recipe 9.3.  See Also “The Local Domain Name” and “Windows 2000” in Chapter 6 of DNS and BIND; “DNS Suffix” in Chapter 6 of DNS on Windows 2000.  9.3  Conﬁguring a Resolver to Append Multiple Domain Names to Arguments  Problem You want to configure a resolver to append more than one domain name to incom- plete domain name arguments.  Solution On a BIND resolver, configure a search list by adding a search directive to the resolv.conf file. You can specify up to six domain names as arguments to the search directive, in the order in which you want the resolver to append them. For example, specifying:  search foo.example bar.example  170    Chapter 9: Resolvers and Programming  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   tells your resolver to try appending foo.example to domain name arguments, and if that doesn’t produce a real domain name, to try bar.example.  For a Windows resolver, find the resolver configuration window and set the Domain Suffix Search Order, Microsoft’s term for the search list. In Windows 2000, for exam- ple, you can bring up the resolver configuration window by choosing Start ➝ Settings ➝ Control Panel ➝ Network and Dial-up Connections. Right-click on the name of your network connection, select Properties, then double-click on Internet Protocol  TCP IP  Properties. Finally, choose Advanced ➝ DNS…. Check the box labeled Append these DNS suffixes  in order , and set the search list in the list box below.  Discussion The search directive also sets the local domain name to its first argument, so be sure to delete any domain directive in resolv.conf when you add search.  See Also “The Search List” and “Windows 2000” in Chapter 6 of DNS and BIND; “Search List” in Chapter 6 of DNS on Windows 2000.  9.4  Sorting Multiple Addresses in a Response  Problem You want to configure a resolver to sort addresses on certain networks to the front of responses that include multiple A records.  Solution For a BIND 4.9 or later resolver, add a sortlist directive to resolv.conf, telling the resolver which networks to prefer. The arguments to the sortlist directive are either network numbers or network and netmask pairs, separated by a slash  “ ” . If you specify just a network number, the resolver assumes you mean the whole class A, B, or C network, as determined by the first two bits of the network. For example, given this sortlist directive, the resolver will sort addresses on the network 128.32 16 to the beginning of the list of addresses that it passes back to applications:  sortlist 128.32.0.0  If you specify a network and a netmask, use dotted-octet quantities for both. For example:  sortlist 10.1.0.0 255.255.0.0  9.4 Sorting Multiple Addresses in a Response    171  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Some Windows operating systems, including Windows NT 4.0 after Service Pack 4 and Windows 2000, also include resolvers that sort addresses, though the function isn’t particularly configurable. When these resolvers share a subnet with the name server they query, they sort addresses on that subnet to the front of responses they return to applications.  You can turn address sorting off with these resolvers by setting the value of the fol- lowing Registry key to zero:  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters \ PrioritizeRecordData  Discussion Since most applications simple-mindedly use the first address returned before the rest, this configuration induces many applications to prefer addresses in the sortlist. Note, however, that in some cases the sortlist can also prevent round robin from working, since the resolver may sort responses that include matching addresses.  See Also “The sortlist directive” in Chapter 6 of DNS and BIND; “Subnet Prioritization” in Chapter 6 of DNS on Windows 2000.  9.5  Changing the Resolver’s Timeout  Problem You want to change a resolver’s timeout.  Solution With a resolver based on BIND 8.2 or later code, use the options timeout directive in resolv.conf. The directive’s argument is a timeout in seconds, separated from the key- word timeout with a colon. For example, to set the initial timeout to two seconds, you could add this directive to resolv.conf:  options timeout:2  The maximum value is 30 seconds; the minimum is 1 second.  The default timeout for the first round of queries is five seconds per name server. After each round of queries to the name servers listed in resolv.conf, the resolver dou- bles the initial timeout. BIND 8.2 and previous resolvers send a total of four rounds of queries; BIND 8.2.1 and later resolvers send two.  172    Chapter 9: Resolvers and Programming  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   There is no way to modify the timeouts in a Windows resolver. However, the default timeouts are fairly short in newer Windows resolvers  one second for the first query in Windows 2000, for example , so adjusting them may not be necessary.  Discussion If you’re using a BIND 8.2 or later resolver, you may also find it useful to change the number of rounds of queries the resolver sends with options attempts. options attempts takes an integer number of attempts as an argument, after a colon. For example:  options attempts:1  Again, the default value is four up to BIND 8.2, and two thereafter. The maximum value for the option is five.  To specify multiple options, use a single options directive, like so:  options timeout:2 attempts:4  If you or your users are experiencing lots of timeouts, however, consider taking a close look at your name servers before monkeying with the resolver timeout. A cor- rectly configured, reasonably loaded name server should be able to respond to nearly any query in less five seconds, assuming that the name servers authoritative for the zone that contains the answer are reachable and themselves correctly configured.  See Also “The options Directive” in Chapter 6 of DNS and BIND; “Name Servers to Query” in Chapter 6 of DNS on Windows 2000.  9.6  Conﬁguring the Order in Which a Resolver Uses DNS,  etc hosts, and NIS  Problem You want to configure the order in which a system’s resolver consults various nam- ing services.  Solution Some vendor’s BIND resolvers support configuration of the order in which the resolvers look up names using the various naming services they support. These nam- ing services may include DNS, NIS, NIS+ and  etc hosts. On the Solaris and HP-UX  9.6 Configuring the Order in Which a Resolver Uses DNS,  etc hosts, and NIS    173  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   operating systems, as well as recent versions of Linux and Irix, resolver service order is configured using the nsswitch.conf file, which usually resides in the  etc directory. Lines in nsswitch.conf begin with the name of a database, followed by a colon and a list of one or more sources. For the resolver, the database name is hosts, and the pos- sible sources are:  The name servers listed in resolv.conf  Sun’s Network Information Service  dns  files  nis   etc hosts  nisplus  Sun’s NIS+  The resolver tries the sources in the order listed, so to tell the resolver to check  etc  hosts before querying a name server, you could add this line to nsswitch.conf:  hosts: files dns  By default, the resolver continues to the next source if the previous isn’t available or can’t find a name. You can modify this behavior by adding condition=action clauses between source names. The possible conditions are:  unavail  notfound  tryagain  success  True if the previous source hasn’t been configured  for example, for DNS, there’s no local name server running and no resolv.conf file .  True if a lookup using the previous source returns an answer that indicates that the name doesn’t exist.  True if a lookup using the previous source indicates a temporary failure  for example, a DNS query timeout .  True if a lookup using the previous source succeeds.  The supported actions are either return  return the result from the previous source  or continue  go on to the next source . The clause is written in square brackets:  hosts: files [notfound=continue] dns  On Windows 95, 98, and ME, you can configure resolver service order by adding subkeys to the following Registry key:  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\MSTCP\ServiceProvider  174    Chapter 9: Resolvers and Programming  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   The four Registry subkeys, each a signed, 16-bit number in hexadecimal format, con- trol the order in which the Windows resolver uses the HOSTS and LMHOSTS files, name servers, and NBT queries to resolve names:  LocalPriority  HostsPriority  DNSPriority  NetbtPriority  The LMHOSTS file, default priority 499  The HOSTS file, default priority 500  The configured name servers, default priority 2000  NBT queries, default priority 2001  The lower the value of the key, the earlier the resolver uses that naming service. Deleting a subkey prevents the resolver from using the corresponding service.  Discussion Some older versions of Linux support configuration of the service order using a file called host.conf; try man host.conf to see if your version does.  The only support in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 for configuring the ser- vice order is a single Registry key:  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\ DnsNbtLookupOrder  The default value, 0, tells the resolver to query name servers before using NBT que- ries. Set the value to 1 to instruct the resolver to use NBT queries first.  See Also “Vendor-Specific Options” in Chapter 6 of DNS and BIND.  9.7  Looking Up Records Programmatically  Problem You want to look up resource records within a computer program.  Solution One of the easiest ways to look up records programmatically is to use the Net::DNS Perl module, originally developed by Michael Fuhr and now maintained by Chris Rein- hardt. You can get a copy of Net::DNS from http:  www.net-dns.org , or from CPAN.  9.7 Looking Up Records Programmatically    175  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Once you’ve installed Net::DNS, using it is easy. A program to look up a domain name’s addresses could be as simple as this:  ! usr bin perl –w  use Net::DNS;   If the user didn't specify a domain name to look up, exit die "Usage:  $0  " unless  @ARGV == 1 ;   Create a resolver object my $res   = Net::DNS::Resolver->new;   Look up A records  the default  for the domain name argument my $query = $res->search $ARGV[0] ;   If this returned an answer... if  $query  {       Print every A record in the answer message     foreach my $rr  $query->answer  {         next unless $rr->type eq "A";         print $rr->address, "\n";     }   Otherwise print an error } else {     print "query failed: ", $res->errorstring, "\n"; }  Looking up other types of records only requires adding the type after the domain name argument; for example, changing the line of the script that calls $res->search to:  my $query = $res->search $ARGV[0], "MX" ;  And, naturally, you’d need to change the type of record you looked for in the foreach loop and what you printed when you found a record of the right type:       Print every MX record in the answer message     foreach my $rr  $query->answer  {         next unless $rr->type eq "MX";         print $rr->string, "\n";  Discussion There are lots of ways to look up records—both in Perl and in other programming languages. Choose whichever language you’re most comfortable with: It’s a good bet that it supports some method of querying name servers. For the fastest performance possible, you should probably use C. Chapter 15 of DNS and BIND describes how to use C’s resolver routines to do simple DNS lookups.  176    Chapter 9: Resolvers and Programming  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   See Also The Net::DNS web site at http:  www.net-dns.org , and Chapter 15 of DNS and BIND.  9.8  Transferring a Zone Programmatically  Problem You want to transfer a zone within a computer program.  Solution One of the easiest ways to work with DNS programmatically is to use Perl’s Net::DNS module, whether you’re looking up discrete records or transferring an entire zone. Here’s a short Perl script to transfer a zone specified on the command line and print the results:   If the user didn't specify the domain name of a zone and the domain name  or address of a name server to transfer from, exit die "Usage:  $0    " unless  @ARGV == 2 ;  ! usr bin perl -w  use Net::DNS;   Create a resolver object my $res  = Net::DNS::Resolver->new;   Use the specified name server $res->nameservers $ARGV[1] ;   Transfer the zone my @zone = $res->axfr $ARGV[0] ;   Print each record in the zone foreach $rr  @zone  {         $rr->print; }  Discussion A more sophisticated script might require only the domain name of the zone, and would then look up the zone’s NS records to find its authoritative name servers. And a more bulletproof script would do a whole lot more error checking.  Remember that you can only transfer a zone from a name server authoritative for that zone, and only if said name server allows you to. If you restrict zone transfers  9.8 Transferring a Zone Programmatically    177  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   using TSIG, you can still use newer versions of Net::DNS to sign zone transfer requests. See Recipe 9.10 for details.  See Also Recipe 9.10 for sending TSIG-signed requests.  9.9  Updating a Zone Programmatically  Problem You want to dynamically update a zone programmatically.  Solution I don’t want to sound like a broken record, but here’s another place where Net::DNS shines. Sending dynamic updates with the C resolver routines is fairly unpleasant. With Net::DNS, it’s a breeze. Here’s a script that uses dynamic update to add an A record for a host:   If the user didn't specify the domain name and address of a host to add, exit die "Usage:  $0    " unless  @ARGV == 2 ;  ! usr bin perl -w  use Net::DNS;  my $host = $ARGV[0]; my $zone = $host; my $addr = $ARGV[1]; my $primary;    Simplemindedly  Derive the domain name of the zone from the domain  name of the host $zone =~ s ^[\w-]+\.  ;   Create the update message my $update = Net::DNS::Update->new $zone ;   Add an A records for the host $update->push update -> rr_add "$host. 86400 A $addr"  ;  Find the zone's primary master name server my $res = Net::DNS::Resolver->new; my $query = $res->query $zone, "SOA" ;  if  $query  {         $primary =  $query->answer [0]->mname;  178    Chapter 9: Resolvers and Programming  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   } else {         die "Couldn't find primary master name server: ", $res->errorstring, "\n "; }  $res->nameservers $primary ;  my $reply = $res->send $update ;   Did it work? if  defined $reply  {         if  $reply->header->rcode eq "NOERROR"  {                 print "Update succeeded\n";         } else {                 print "Update failed: ", $reply->header->rcode, "\n";         } }  Discussion As with the scripts in Recipes 9.7 and 9.8, this script doesn’t do much input or error checking. Also, it could be more flexible: it could allow you to specify the TTL for the A record, and it could find the domain name of the zone to update by stripping off the labels of the domain name until it finds an SOA record, instead of just remov- ing the first label and calling it a day.  Authorizing dynamic updates is a particularly apt use of TSIG. For help with signing dynamic updates with TSIG, see Recipe 9.10.  See Also Recipe 5.19 for instructions on using nsupdate to send dynamic updates; Recipe 9.10 for sending TSIG-signed dynamic updates programmatically.  9.10 Signing Queries and Dynamic Updates  with TSIG Programmatically  Problem You want to use TSIG to sign a query or a dynamic update in Perl.  Solution After you’ve used Net::DNS to create a query or an update to send, use the sign_tsig method to sign the query or update using that key. sign_tsig takes a key name and  9.10 Signing Queries and Dynamic Updates with TSIG Programmatically    179  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   the base 64 encoding of the key’s data as arguments. For example, to sign the update in the script in Recipe 9.9, you could replace this line of the script:  my $reply = $res->send $update ;  With these lines:  $update->sign_tsig "update.key", "oyyvQvT0BTIcw7vvqvIJaQ==" ;  my $reply = $res->send $update ;  You can also use TSIG to sign queries. Since the Net::DNS resolver’s axfr method doesn’t give you access to the query message, you must configure the resolver to sign all queries using the key before sending the AXFR query, rather than signing just the query. Here’s a modified snippet of the script in Recipe 9.8 that shows one way to do that:  $tsig = Net::DNS::RR->new "tsig.key TSIG oyyvQvT0BTIcw7vvqvIJaQ==" ; $res->tsig $tsig ;   Transfer the zone my @zone = $res->axfr $ARGV[0] ;  Discussion Remember that the key’s name and data must match in the script and on the name server that receives the query or update, and that the clocks on the sender of the mes- sage and on the name server that receives it must be synchronized within a few min- utes of each other.  See Also Recipe 7.9 for instructions on configuring a TSIG key, Recipe 7.10 for instructions on securing zone transfers with TSIG, and Recipe 3.10 for securing dynamic updates with update-policy.  180    Chapter 9: Resolvers and Programming  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Chapter 10  CHAPTER 10 Logging and Troubleshooting  10.0 Introduction BIND name servers, particularly busy ones, can log a tremendous volume of mes- sages. Many administrators are so cowed by the quantity of messages that they sim- ply abandon trying to track them. Knowing how to sift and sort the messages, as described in Recipes 10.3 to 10.8, can help you keep up.  The recipes later in the chapter describe how to use dig, the Swiss Army Knife of DNS query tools. The latest versions of dig will trace name resolution, send TSIG- signed queries and more, all with a few command-line options.  10.1 Finding a Syntax Error in a named.conf File  Problem You need to find a syntax error in a name server’s named.conf file.  Solution If you suspect you have a syntax error in named.conf, check the name server’s syslog output to see if named logged any error messages the last time you started or reloaded it. Look for a message like this, indicating the last time you started the name server:  Jun 25 15:42:43 ns1 named[53702]: starting BIND 9.2.1 Jun 25 15:42:43 ns1 named[53702]: using 1 CPU Jun 25 15:42:43 ns1 named[53702]: loading configuration from ' etc named.conf'  If you reloaded the name server, the message will look like this:  Jun 25 15:44:25 ns1 named[53702]: loading configuration from ' etc named.conf'  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  181   If you can’t find the last time the name server was started or reloaded, you can always reload it again with rndc reload  BIND 9  or ndc reload  BIND 8 , then check named’s syslog output immediately. Or you can start a BIND 9 name server with the –g option, which tells named to run in the foreground and send all error messages to standard error. For example:  $ named -g Jun 25 15:53:37.745 starting BIND 9.2.1 -g Jun 25 15:53:37.745 using 1 CPU Jun 25 15:53:37.750 loading configuration from ' etc named.conf' Jun 25 15:53:37.750  etc named.conf:7: missing ';' before 'acl' Jun 25 15:53:37.754 loading configuration: failure Jun 25 15:53:37.754 exiting  due to fatal error   This makes the error fairly obvious: there’s a missing semicolon on line 7 of named.conf, before the keyword acl.  You can also check a named.conf file without running named, by using the BIND 9 named-checkconf program, as described in Recipe 5.2. named-checkconf uses the same routines that named would to check the named.conf file. For example, running named-checkconf on the named.conf file that produced the output above produces very similar output:  $ named-checkconf  etc named.conf:7: missing ';' before 'acl'  Discussion While named-checkconf is not included in BIND 8 distributions—it was introduced in BIND 9.1.0—you can still build a BIND 9 named-checkconf and use it with a named.conf file meant for a BIND 8 name server. Just ignore any errors that tell you that the BIND 8-only configuration substatements you’re using are obsolete:  $ named-checkconf  etc named.conf:29: option 'multiple-cnames' is obsolete  See Also Recipe 5.2, for using named-checkconf to check a named.conf file.  10.2 Finding a Syntax Error in a Zone Data File  Problem You need to find a syntax error in a zone data file.  182    Chapter 10: Logging and Troubleshooting  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Solution Find the log messages from the most recent restart or reload of the name server, reloading again if necessary, as described in Recipe 10.1. Then look for a message indicating the line of the zone data file that contains the error. For example:  Jun 25 16:15:13 ns1 named[53941]: starting BIND 9.2.1 Jun 25 16:15:13 ns1 named[53941]: using 1 CPU Jun 25 16:15:13 ns1 named[53941]: loading configuration from ' etc named.conf' Jun 25 16:15:13 ns1 named[53941]: listening on IPv4 interface fxp0, 192.168.0.153 Jun 25 16:15:13 ns1 named[53941]: listening on IPv4 interface lo0, 127.0.0.153 Jun 25 16:15:13 ns1 named[53941]: command channel listening on 0.0.0.0953 Jun 25 16:15:13 ns1 named[53941]: dns_rdata_fromtext: db.foo.example:7: near eol: unexpected end of input Jun 25 16:15:13 ns1 named[53941]: zone foo.example IN: loading master file db.foo. example: unexpected end of input Jun 25 16:15:13 ns1 named[53941]: running  And, of course, you can start your BIND 9 name server with –g to force it to run in the foreground and print errors to stderr.  If you’d rather not start a new named process, you can use the BIND 9 named-checkzone program, as described in Recipe 5.2. Like named-checkconf, named-checkzone is built with the same routines that named uses. To run it, specify the domain name of the zone and the name of the zone data file as arguments:   named-checkzone foo.example db.foo.example dns_rdata_fromtext: db.foo.example:7: near eol: unexpected end of input zone foo.example IN: loading master file db.foo.example: unexpected end of input  Discussion Since the master file format didn’t change between BIND 8 and BIND 9, you can also use named-checkzone on zone data files you load on your BIND 8 name server. The only difference you might encounter is that BIND 8 name servers can be config- ured to allow multiple CNAME records attached to the same domain name, while BIND 9 name servers can’t.  See Also Recipe 5.2, for using named-checkzone to check a zone data file.  10.3 Sending Log Messages to a Particular File  Problem You want to send some or all of a name server’s log messages to a particular file.  10.3 Sending Log Messages to a Particular File    183  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Solution Add a logging statement to the name server’s named.conf file, creating a new file log channel and sending output in one or more categories to that channel.  For example, to create a channel called security_log that writes logged messages to the file security.log in the name server’s working directory, you could use this logging statement:  logging {     channel security_log {         file "security.log";     }; };  By default, the channel logs any messages at severity info or higher. You can adjust this using the severity substatement:  logging {     channel security_log {         file "security.log";         severity error;       Query logging is at severity info     }; };  This logging statement doesn’t do anything useful yet, because no categories of mes- sages are actually assigned to the channel. To specify a channel to send output in a par- ticular category to, add a category substatement to your logging statement. For example:  logging {     channel security_log {         file "security.log";     };      category security { "security_log"; }; };  Both BIND 8 and BIND 9 categorize most messages they log, but they use different category names. See “Category Details” in Chapter 7 of DNS and BIND for a list. One difference that merits special mention is BIND 8’s default category; in BIND 8, default includes both categories of messages not explicitly assigned to a channel and messages that aren’t categorized. BIND 9 name servers still use the default category for the former purpose, but the new general category for the latter.  Discussion By default, the name server will only log the message itself to the log channel. The print-time channel substatement tells the name server to print a timestamp before the logged message, which produces output like this:  Jun 26 15:49:41.554 client 192.168.0.11889: update foo.example IN' denied  184    Chapter 10: Logging and Troubleshooting  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Here’s how to set print-time in the security_log channel:  logging {     channel security_log {         file "security.log";         severity error;       Query logging is at severity info         print-time yes;       Print a timestamp with each message     }; };  It’s not always obvious which category a given message is assigned to. If you need to figure out the category a particular message is in, see Recipe 10.5.  See Also Recipe 10.5 for determining the category of a message, Recipe 10.8 for setting up log file rotation, and “The Logging Statement” in Chapter 7 of DNS and BIND.  10.4 Discarding a Category of Messages  Problem You want to discard all messages logged in a particular category.  Solution Add a category substatement to the logging statement in the name server’s named.conf file  or add a logging statement, if named.conf doesn’t contain one , assigning the cate- gory to the null channel. For example, you can discard all messages about lame name servers with this logging statement:  logging {     category lame-servers { null; }; };  Discussion The update-security category, introduced in BIND 9.3.0, was created just so adminis- trators could dump “Update denied” messages into the null channel without missing more important security-related messages.  See Also Recipe 8.6, to stop Windows computers from trying to dynamically update a zone, Recipe 10.5, if you’re not sure which category a message is in, and “The Logging Statement” in Chapter 7 of DNS and BIND.  10.4 Discarding a Category of Messages    185  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   10.5 Determining Which Category  a Message Is In  Problem You need to determine which logging category a particular message is in.  Solution With a BIND 9 name server, add a channel substatement to the logging statement in named.conf, redefining the default_syslog channel so that the name server prints the category of all messages. For example:  logging {     channel default_syslog {         syslog daemon;           usually the default         print-category yes;     }; };  Then wait for the message in question to reappear, or induce the name server to log it again. The name server will print the category of the message just before the mes- sage itself. For example:  Jun 26 16:31:56 ns1 named[62314]: general: loading configuration from ' etc named. conf'  This shows that this message is in the general category.  BIND 8 name servers won’t let you redefine the default_syslog channel, so define a new syslog channel and assign the default category of messages to it:  logging {      channel new_syslog {         syslog daemon;         print-category yes;     };      category default { new_syslog; };  };  Discussion You can use the same technique to find out the severity a given message is logged at; just use the print-severity substatement instead of print-category.  186    Chapter 10: Logging and Troubleshooting  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   See Also “The Logging Statement” in Chapter 7 of DNS and BIND.  10.6 Sending syslog Output to Another Host  Problem You want to send a name server’s syslog output to another host.  Solution Add a line to your host’s syslog.conf file, telling syslogd to send messages logged in the facility the name server uses—usually daemon—to a remote host. For example, to send facility daemon messages to a remote host called loghost.foo.example, you could add this entry to syslog.conf:  daemon.info    @loghost.foo.example  Discussion On the remote host, you may need to change syslogd’s command-line options to accept messages logged from the host that runs the name server. On some operating systems, you specify the address of a remote host that’s allowed to log messages via syslog using syslogd’s –a command-line option. For example, to allow messages logged from the host at 192.168.0.1, you could start syslogd as:  To allow messages logged from any host on the 192.168.0 24 network, you could use:   syslogd –a 192.168.0.1 32   syslogd –a 192.168.0 24  To specify multiple addresses or networks, use multiple –a options.  If you just want to send named’s logged output to the remote host—not everything logged to the daemon facility—redefine the default_syslog channel to use one of the local facilities, local0 to local7. For example:  logging {     channel default_syslog {         syslog local0;     }; };  For a BIND 8 name server, you’ll need to create a new syslog channel, as described in Recipe 10.5, since you can’t redefine default_syslog.  10.6 Sending syslog Output to Another Host    187  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Then add an entry to syslog.conf to send all messages in the facility to the remote host:  local0.*        @loghost.foo.example  Aggregating the syslog output from all of your BIND name servers on a single host can make monitoring those name servers much easier: you only have one syslog file to watch.  See Also syslogd 8 , syslog.conf 5 , and Recipe 10.5, for defining a new channel for default syslog messages.  10.7 Logging Dynamic Updates  Problem You want to log the dynamic updates received by a name server.  Solution By default, a name server will log dynamic updates it receives, both successful and failed, at severity info. For each successful dynamic update, you’ll see a message like this in the name server’s syslog output:  Jun 25 19:55:38 ns1 named[54132]: client 192.168.0.12206: updating zone 'foo. example IN': deleting an rrset  For each failed dynamic update, you’ll see a message like this:  Jun 25 19:57:39 ns1 named[54132]: client 192.168.0.12213: update 'foo.example IN' denied  Or, for an update that failed because a prerequisite wasn’t met, you’ll see a message like this one:  Jun 25 20:00:02 ns1 named[54132]: client 192.168.0.12220: updating zone 'foo. example IN': update failed: 'name in use' prerequisite not satisfied  NXDOMAIN   The first and last types of dynamic update messages are logged in the update cate- gory; the middle variety is logged in the security category. You can separate these messages from others by adding a logging statement to the name server’s named.conf file that sends messages in each of these categories to special files. For example:  logging {      channel update_log {         file "update.log";         severity info;         print-time yes;     };  188    Chapter 10: Logging and Troubleshooting  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.       channel security_log {         file "security.log";         severity info;         print-time yes;     };      category update { update_log; };     category security { security_log; };  };  Discussion If you don’t see any messages in the syslog output, check the host’s syslog.conf file and make sure syslogd is logging all messages at severity info or higher. named usually logs to the facility daemon, so an entry to log all of those messages might look like this:  daemon.info     var log messages  Note that there are many different security-related messages in the security category, most of them unrelated to dynamic updates. In BIND 9.3.0, the name server sepa- rates update- from other security-related messages by placing “update denied” mes- sages into update-security category.  As you can see from the messages cited so far in this recipe, the standard syslog mes- sages about dynamic updates say very little about the contents of an update  that is, the change that the update made or tried to make , except the zone that the update tried to modify. To see the changes that were made, you’d have to look at the dynamic update log file. In BIND 8, the dynamic update log file is named after the zone data file, with .log on the end. In BIND 9, the file ends in .jnl. The .log file is in ASCII format and contains human-readable entries like this:  ;BIND LOG V8 [DYNAMIC_UPDATE] id 56537 from [192.168.0.1].4662 at 1019882646  named pid 21378 : zone:   origin foo.example class IN serial 2002042600 update: {add} test.foo.example 3600 IN A 10.0.0.93  These entries, significantly, include a timestamp that indicates when the update was processed; for this update, the timestamp is 1019882646, the number of seconds since the Unix epoch. To convert that to a date and time, you can use the date command:  $ date –r 1019882646 Fri Apr 26 22:44:06 MDT 2002  The timestamp may help you correlate this change with a particular message from the name server’s syslog output.  The .jnl file is in a binary format. To decipher it, build the journalprint program from the BIND distribution:  $ cd bin tests $ make journalprint  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  10.7 Logging Dynamic Updates    189   To run journalprint, just specify the journal file you want to decode as the argument:  $ journalprint db.foo.example.jnl del foo.example.                86400   IN      SOA     ns1.foo.example. root.foo. example. 2002062500 3600 900 2592000 3600 add foo.example.                86400   IN      SOA     ns1.foo.example. root.foo. example. 2002062501 3600 900 2592000 3600 add mail.foo.example.   3600    IN      A       192.168.0.2 add foo.example.                3600    IN      MX      0 mail.foo.example. add foo.example.                3600    IN      TXT     "Test update"  The lines that begin with del indicate records deleted, while lines that begin with add... well, you get the idea. You’ll see the zone’s SOA record being added and deleted with every update: that’s actually just the serial number incrementing automatically.  Since there’s no timestamp in the journal file, it’s not generally possible to correlate individual changes with particular syslog messages.  See Also Recipe 3.10, for allowing dynamic updates to a zone.  10.8 Rotating Log Files  Problem You want to rotate a name server’s log files.  Solution BIND name servers support a limited form of log file rotation. When you define a file channel, you can specify that the name server keep some number of versions of the file with the versions argument to the file substatement. For example, this channel definition tells the name server to save seven versions of the named.log file:  logging {     channel "named_log" {         file "named.log" versions 7;         print-time yes;     }; };  The name server will only rotate the files when it’s restarted or reloaded, so after seven restarts or reloads, you’ll have a named.log, named.log.1, and so on.  You can combine the versions argument with the size argument to tell the name server to rotate the log file once it reaches a certain size. For example, to rotate the log file once it reaches a megabyte in size, you could use this channel substatement:  190    Chapter 10: Logging and Troubleshooting  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   logging {     channel "named_log" {         file "named.log" versions 7 size 1m;         print-time yes;     }; };  Discussion With a size specified, log files are only renamed when the current log file exceeds the size limit, not on restart or reload.  Use the keyword unlimited to keep an unlimited number of old versions of a log file:  logging {     channel "named_log" {         file "named.log" versions unlimited size 1m;         print-time yes;     }; };  On BIND 8, unlimited is actually synonymous with “99” for purposes of log file rotation.  See Also “The Logging Statement” in Chapter 7 of DNS and BIND.  10.9 Looking Up Records with dig  Problem You want to look up records using dig.  Solution Specify the domain name you want to look up, the record type you’re interested in  unless it’s A, the default , and the domain name or IP address of the name server you want to query  unless it’s the first one in your resolver’s configuration, which is the default  as arguments to dig:  $ dig @a.gtld-servers.net a www.oreilly.com  The arguments may appear in any order: dig is smart enough to determine which is which  fairly easy, since the name server’s domain name or address has an “@” in front of it, domain names usually have dots in them, and there are only so many record types .  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  10.9 Looking Up Records with dig    191   Unlike nslookup, dig doesn’t apply the search list by default, so use fully qualified domain names, both to specify the domain name you want to look up and any remote name server you want to query.  Discussion dig prints the DNS response message it gets back in a very detailed format. For exam- ple, here’s the output produced by the dig command above:  ;  > DiG 9.2.1  > @a.gtld-servers.net www.oreilly.com a ;; global options:  printcmd ;; Got answer: ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 17064 ;; flags: qr rd; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 2, ADDITIONAL: 2  ;; QUESTION SECTION: ;www.oreilly.com.

The banner, on the first line, echoes the query sent  for A records for www.oreilly.com on a.gtld-servers.net . dig also prints the header  after ->>HEADER<<- , which tells us that this was a standard QUERY response  not a NOTIFY message or dynamic update , and that the return code was NOERROR, indicating that the query was processed successfully.  The rest of the header shows us that this was a nonauthoritative  aa didn’t appear as a flag  response  qr was set . The query was recursive  rd means “recursion desired”  but recursion wasn’t available  ra didn’t appear as a flag . That’s not surprising, since we sent the query to a gTLD name server.  The QUESTION SECTION parrots the question we asked  again , and the AUTHORITY SECTION shows the two NS records returned by the name server we queried, referring us to name servers closer to the answer. The ADDITIONAL SECTION gives us the addresses of those name servers.  At the end, we see that the response took 80 milliseconds, that the name server we queried was a.gtld-servers.net at 192.5.6.30, plus a date- and timestamp and the fact that the reply was 109 bytes long.  192    Chapter 10: Logging and Troubleshooting  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Discussion If the PTR record reverse-mapping the address is in a zone delegated using the scheme described in RFC 2317  Recipe 6.4 , you may need to specify the type PTR on the command line, too: older versions of dig send queries for records in any type when you use the –x option. You can tell which variety your dig is by looking at the type of the query in the QUESTION SECTION. The version of dig we used in this recipe was a newer one, which sends an explicit PTR query.  You can also use dig’s –x option just to build the domain name to look up from the octets of the IP address and specify a different record type on the command line. For example, to look up A records attached to 0.168.192.in-addr.arpa  read RFC 1101 for why you’d ever want to do that , you could use:  $ dig –x 192.168.0 a  See Also dig 1 ; Recipe 6.4; RFCs 1101 and 2317; “Using dig” in Chapter 12 of DNS and BIND.  194    Chapter 10: Logging and Troubleshooting  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

For example:  $ dig @ns1.foo.example axfr foo.example  dig will print the results of the zone transfer:  ;  > DiG 9.2.1  > @ns1.foo.example axfr foo.example ;; global options:  printcmd foo.example.            86400   IN      SOA     ns1.foo.example. root.foo.example. 2002062502 3600 900 2592000 3600 foo.example.            86400   IN      NS      ns1.foo.example. foo.example.            3600    IN      MX      0 mail.foo.example. mail.foo.example.       3600    IN      A       192.168.0.2 ns1.foo.example.        86400   IN      A       192.168.0.1 foo.example.            86400   IN      SOA     ns1.foo.example. root.foo.example. 2002062502 3600 900 2592000 3600 ;; Query time: 183 msec ;; SERVER: 192.168.0.153 ns1.foo.example  ;; WHEN: Fri Jun 28 11:05:20 2002 ;; XFR size: 7 records  Discussion The SOA record appears twice in the output because name servers use a zone’s SOA record to delimit the beginning and the end of the transfer.  You’ll only be able to transfer zones from name servers that are authoritative for those zones, of course, and that allow zone transfers from the address of the host you’re running dig on. If you try to transfer a zone from a name server that won’t allow zone transfers from your address, you’ll see output like this:  $ dig @ns1.foo.example axfr bar.example  ;  > DiG 9.2.1  > @ns1.foo.example axfr bar.example ;; global options:  printcmd ; Transfer failed.  Finally, if the name server you’re trying to transfer the zone from uses TSIG to secure transfers, you can use dig’s –k command-line option to sign the query. With a BIND 9 version of dig, you can use the –k or –y command-line options. See Recipe 5.22 for  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

See Also dig 1 ; Recipe 5.22, for specifying a TSIG key with –k or –y; Recipe 7.10, for secur- ing zone transfers; and “Zone Transfers with dig” in Chapter 12 of DNS and BIND.  10.12 Tracing Name Resolution Using dig  Problem You want to trace the process of name resolution using dig.  Solution Starting with a root name server, send nonrecursive queries  with the +norec com- mand-line option  for the records you’re looking for.  The root name servers are named [a-m].root-servers.net.  For example:  $ dig @a.root-servers.net www.oreilly.com +norec  ;  > DiG 9.2.1  > @a.root-servers.net www.oreilly.com +norec ;; global options:  printcmd ;; Got answer: ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 44699 ;; flags: qr; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 13, ADDITIONAL: 13  ;; QUESTION SECTION: ;www.oreilly.com.

Discussion Notice that the query doesn’t change: in this example, we look up A records for www.oreilly.com each time. By following the referrals, we get closer and closer to the name servers authoritative for the zone that contains the answer.  BIND 9’s version of dig has a command-line option to trace name resolution auto- matically—very slick! To reproduce the output above, you only need to run:  $ dig +trace www.oreilly.com  dig starts by looking up the list of root name servers on your default name server, then sends a nonrecursive query to one of them for the records you specified on the command line. Then it follows referrals, as we did, until it finds an answer.  If you’re trying to track down a problem, not just reenacting name resolution for per- sonal or pedagogical reasons, pay careful attention to dig’s output. Look for responses that indicate that the domain name doesn’t exist  NXDOMAIN in the status field of the header  or that refer you to name servers authoritative for a zone higher up in the namespace  for example, an oreilly.com name server referring you to a com name server , which is a symptom of a lame delegation.  See Also dig 1 ; and Recipe 6.5, for using dig’s +trace option to check delegation.  198    Chapter 10: Logging and Troubleshooting  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Chapter 11  CHAPTER 11 IPv6  11.0 Introduction IPv6 is tomorrow’s internetwork protocol—perennially, it seems. BIND has sup- ported IPv6 forward and reverse-mapping since Version 4.9.5, released way back in 1996. BIND 9, finally, added support for IPv6 as a transport, responding to queries received over IPv6.  The IETF—the body that develops extensions to DNS, among other things—briefly flirted with a very complex method of handling IPv6 forward and reverse-mapping, using A6 and DNAME records and “bitstring labels.”  Unfortunately, I wrote the fourth edition of DNS and BIND at just the wrong time and documented A6 and the rest.  Eventually, however, they opted to standardize on a system that uses AAAA and PTR records in a straightforward way, similar to the way A and PTR records work with IPv4 addresses.  11.1 Conﬁguring a Name Server to Listen  for Queries on an IPv6 Interface  Problem You want a BIND 9 name server to listen for queries on an IPv6 interface.  Solution Use the listen-on-v6 options substatement to instruct the name server to listen on any of the host’s IPv6 interfaces for queries. For example:  options {     directory " var named";     listen-on-v6 { any; }; };  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  199   Don’t specify the particular IPv6 address of one of the host’s interfaces: listen-on-v6 only supports any or none as an argument. The default, as of BIND 9.1.0, is none; that is, don’t listen for queries on any IPv6 interfaces.  Discussion Before BIND 9.1.0, BIND 9 name servers listened on any of the host’s IPv6 inter- faces by default. BIND 8 name servers can’t handle queries received via IPv6 at all.  As with its IPv4 counterpart, you can use listen-on-v6 to tell a name server to listen on an alternate port, too. For example, you could configure the name server to listen on port 1053 for IPv6 queries with:  options {     directory " var named";     listen-on-v6 port 1053 { any; }; };  Note that none of the root name servers have IPv6 interfaces, which makes it diffi- cult to run an IPv6-only name server on the Internet. Typically, name servers with IPv6 interfaces also have at least one IPv4 interface, or forward to a name server that has both kinds.  See Also “Configuring the IPv6 Transport” in Chapter 10 of DNS and BIND.  11.2 Conﬁguring a Name Server to Send Queries  from a Particular IPv6 Address  Problem You want a BIND 9 name server to send queries from a particular IPv6 address.  Solution Use the query-source-v6 options substatement to tell the name server to use a particu- lar IPv6 address as the source address for queries it sends  over IPv6 . For example, to use the address 222:10:2521:1:210:4bff:fe10:d24 as the source address for IPv6 queries, you could use:  options {     directory " var named";     query-source-v6 address 222:10:2521:1:210:4bff:fe10:d24; };  200    Chapter 11:  IPv6  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Discussion Only BIND 9 name servers can handle an IPv6 transport, so don’t try this with a BIND 8 name server.  You can specify a particular source port to use for IPv6 queries by using the port argument. For example:  options {     directory " var named";     query-source-v6 address 222:10:2521:1:210:4bff:fe10:d24 port 5353; };  There are also IPv6 counterparts to the transfer-source and notify-source substate- ments called, predictably, transfer-source-v6 and notify-source-v6, respectively. The syntax is the same as the syntax of query-source-v6 substatement, minus the address keyword. For example:  zone "foo.example" {     type slave;     masters { 222:10:2521:1:210:4bff:fe10:d24; };     file "bak.foo.example";     transfer-source-v6 222:10:2521:1:210:4c00:fe11:d22; };  See Also “Configuring the IPv6 Transport” in Chapter 10 of DNS and BIND.  11.3 Adding a Host with an IPv6 Interface  Problem You need to add forward- and reverse-mapping records for a host with an IPv6 interface.  Solution Add a AAAA  pronounced “quad A”  record to the host’s domain name, mapping the name to the host’s IPv6 address. The RDATA of the AAAA record is an IPv6 address represented as eight groups of as many as four hexidecimal digits, separated by colons. For example:  0123:4567:89ab:cdef:0123:4567:89ab:cdef  Groups of hex digits that begin with one or more zeroes can be written without the zeroes, so that address could also be written as 123:4567:89ab:cdef:123:4567:89ab:cdef.  So a complete AAAA record might look like this:  host-v6.foo.example.  IN  AAAA  123:4567:89ab:cdef:123:4567:89ab:cdef  11.3 Adding a Host with an IPv6 Interface    201  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   To reverse map the address back to a domain name, create a reverse-mapping zone under ip6.arpa to correspond to the network the host is on. Each label to the left of ip6.arpa corresponds to a nibble  four bits  of the 128-bit IPv6 address, written  as it was in the AAAA record’s RDATA  as a hex digit. As with reverse-mapping zones for IPv4, the labels are written in the domain name in the opposite order as the corre- sponding bits appear in the address. So if you run the network 123:4567:89ab:cdef 64, you’d create a zone called f.e.d.c.b.a.9.8.7.6.5.4.3.2.1.0.ip6.arpa.  When creating domain names from IPv6 addresses, you do need to include every nibble of the address; you can’t omit any zeroes.   Within this zone, add a PTR record to the domain name formed by all 32  !  of the nib- bles in the host’s IPv6 address, in reverse order, with ip6.arpa appended. So the PTR record that corresponds to the AAAA record shown earlier in this recipe would be:  f.e.d.c.b.a.9.8.7.6.5.4.3.2.1.0.f.e.d.c.b.a.9.8.7.6.5.4.3.2.1.0.ip6.arpa.  IN  PTR host-v6.foo.example.  This is clearly a good time to take advantage of the default origin in the zone data file  the domain name of the zone , and abbreviate that to:  f.e.d.c.b.a.9.8.7.6.5.4.3.2.1.0    IN    PTR    host-v6.foo.example.  Discussion You’ll need to have your IPv6 reverse-mapping zone delegated to you, just like you had a subdomain of in-addr.arpa delegated to you in Recipe 1.71.7. Unless you work for an ISP, the ISP that assigned your IPv6 address space to you will probably dele- gate your IPv6 reverse-mapping zone to you, too. If you do work for an ISP, you may need to contact one of the address registries listed in Recipe 1.71.7 and ask them to delegate your IPv6 reverse-mapping zone to you.  You can test IPv6 forward- and reverse-mappings with dig. To look up the AAAA record above, you could run:  $ dig host-v6.foo.example aaaa  To look up the PTR record with a BIND 8.3.2 or later version of dig, you could use:  $ dig –x 123:4567:89ab:cdef:123:4567:89ab:cdef  To look up the PTR record with an older BIND 8 or a BIND 9 version of dig, you’d have to use:  $ dig ptr f.e.d.c.b.a.9.8.7.6.5.4.3.2.1.0.f.e.d.c.b.a.9.8.7.6.5.4.3.2.1.0.ip6.arpa  See Also Recipe 1.71.7 for delegation of a reverse-mapping zone, RFC 1886 for the specifica- tion of the AAAA record and ip6.int  which is now ip6.arpa , and “IPv6 Forward and Reverse Mapping” in Chapter 10 of DNS and BIND.  202    Chapter 11:  IPv6  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   11.4 Conﬁguring rndc to Work Over IPv6  Problem You want to use rndc over IPv6.  Solution On a BIND 9.2.0 or later name server, add an inet controls statement to named.conf, telling the name server to listen on the host’s IPv6 interface for control messages. For example:  controls {     inet 123:4567:89ab:cdef:123:4567:89ab:cdef allow { any; } keys { "rndc-key"; }; };  Then specify the host’s IPv6 address as the argument to rndc’s –s option, as in:   rndc –s 123:4567:89ab:cdef:123:4567:89ab:cdef status  If you would like to make that address the default for rndc to connect to, add a default-server options substatement to rndc.conf, like this:  options {     default-server 123:4567:89ab:cdef:123:4567:89ab:cdef;     default-key "rndc-key"; };  Discussion If you don’t want to rely entirely on IPv6 for the name server’s control channel, you can use multiple inet controls substatements. For example:  controls {     inet * allow { localhost; } keys { "rndc-key"; };     inet 123:4567:89ab:cdef:123:4567:89ab:cdef allow { any; } keys { "rndc-key"; }; };  As with listen-on-v6, localhost or localnets ACLs with an IPv6 interface in the controls statement.  introduced in Recipe 11.1, you can’t use the predefined  See Also Recipe 11.1.  11.4 Configuring rndc to Work Over IPv6    203  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2011 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

All rights reserved.   About the Author  Cricket Liu matriculated at the University of California’s Berkeley campus, that great bastion of free speech, unencumbered Unix, and cheap pizza. He joined Hewlett- Packard after graduation and worked for HP for nine years.  Cricket began managing the hp.com zone after the Loma Prieta earthquake forcibly transferred the zone’s management from HP Labs to HP’s Corporate Offices  by cracking a sprinkler main and flooding Labs’ computer room . Cricket was host- master@hp.com for over three years, and then joined HP’s Professional Services Organization to co-found HP’s Internet consulting program.  Cricket left HP in 1997 to form Acme Byte & Wire, a DNS consulting and training company, with his friend  and now co-author  Matt Larson. Network Solutions acquired Acme in June 2000, and later the same day merged with VeriSign. Cricket worked for a year as Director of DNS Product Management for VeriSign Global Registry Services.  In September 2001, Cricket joined Men & Mice, an Icelandic company specializing in DNS software and services. He is currently their Vice President of Research and Development.  Cricket, his wife, Paige, and their son, Walt, live in Colorado with two Siberian Huskies, Annie and Dakota. On warm weekend afternoons, you’ll probably find them on the flying trapeze or wakeboarding behind Betty Blue.  Colophon  Our look is the result of reader comments, our own experimentation, and feedback from distribution channels. Distinctive covers complement our distinctive approach to technical topics, breathing personality and life into potentially dry subjects.  The animal on the cover of DNS and BIND Cookbook is an opossum. Opossums are solitary, nocturnal mammals. They can be found in forests, fields, marshes, and farmlands, living in hollow trees, old buildings, and the abandoned dens of other animals. Opossums have clawless opposable toes on their hind feet that they can use like thumbs to grasp and hold onto branches. They can also hang by their tails for short periods of time. Opossums are the only North American marsupial: their young are born partially developed, and then carried by the female in a pouch called a marsupium for seven to ten weeks. The North American opossum is called the Virginia opossum  Didelphis virginiana .  Opossums are not aggressive. The phrase “playing possum” comes from an involun- tary behavior the opossum exhibits when frightened: it rolls over, closes its eyes, and lays still. As its heartbeat slows, the animal gives the appearance of death, causing many predators to lose interest. When the opossum recovers from its shock, it wakes up and walks away. Opossum predators include foxes, coyotes, owls, and cars.   Colleen Gorman was the production editor and the proofreader for DNS and BIND Cookbook.
