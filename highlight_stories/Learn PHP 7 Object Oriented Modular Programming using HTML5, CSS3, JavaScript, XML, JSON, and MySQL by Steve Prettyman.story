Special thanks to the Introduction to PHP  classes that have been the true testers and debuggers for this journey.  Special acknowledgement to all the open source developers and providers of free tutorials and training   to every Internet user who wants to learn more about programming, especially w3schools and The New  Boston.  xiii   Introduction  Learn PHP 7: Object-Oriented Modular Programming using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, XML, JSON, and  MySQL is intended for use as a beginning level programming book. It is not the goal of this book to cover  advanced techniques in the current versions of the PHP programming language. Some knowledge of general  programming concepts is expected but no actual programming experience or education is assumed.   All code examples in this book are compatible with PHP 7. Most examples are compatible with PHP 5.6.    The newest  as of the publication date  methods  functions  available in PHP have been used to provide  the reader with the most current coding techniques. The examples use core methods provided in the PHP  language. PHP includes many additional methods to accomplish similar tasks. The reader may, and should,  research additional ways of improving security, performance, and other techniques. It is the goal of this book  to prompt users to always consider using the most secure and efficient methods of program development.  The code in this book provides some examples of using these techniques. The user should remember that  no program is 100% secure. The programmer can only strive to make an application as secure as possible. It  takes a team of developers, network personnel, security administrators, data center personnel, and others  working together to provide the safest environment.  A Different Approach  There are quite a number of PHP books on the market today. What makes this book any different than any  other?    	   	   	   	  This book uses the concept of “learning by doing,” which shows the reader how to  develop applications with conditional statements, loops, arrays, and methods. Over  70 PHP methods  functions  are introduced and demonstrated in coding examples.  From the very first examples, the reader is introduced to object-oriented  programming techniques. Many other books only briefly cover OO programming  if  at all  in the final chapters.   	 Object-oriented set methods are used to verify and filter user input. Many other   books simply show a set method accepting data and storing it.  A major objective of the book is to convince the reader to create all programs as  secure and efficient as possible. The newest password encryption techniques   password_hash  are demonstrated.  The try and catch methods are introduced to capture exceptions and some errors.  The newest versions of PHP have been created to handle exceptions and errors  using this approach. Many other books use die or other techniques to shut down a  program.   	 Multi-tier program design is introduced in the early chapters. This allows the reader  to discover what logic and coding should take place in each tier. Many PHP books do  not even cover this topic.  xv     IntroduCtIon   	   	   	   	   	  The majority of the examples in the book are used to develop one main application   ABC Canine Shelter Reservation System . As the book progresses, the application is  built from the beginning, in stages, showing the reader that application development  should be broken into stages. Only after each stage is completed and tested, can  the next stage begin. This approach works hand in hand with multi-tier design.  Additional programming exercises and a term project are provided to enhance the  understanding of development.  The creation of user, change, and error logs are introduced. This allows the reader  to gain an understanding of how to provide backup and recovery ability to keep an  application functioning properly when security breaches or exceptions occur.  The introduction of data objects and the data tier demonstrates to the reader the  importance of creating an application that provides the ability to change data  storage techniques and data storage location without requiring a major rewrite of the  application. XML, JSON, and MySQL examples are provided.  A natural relationship between PHP, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript is demonstrated  throughout the book. This relationship is one of the major strengths of PHP.  Throughout the book, web links are provided to point the user to additional  resources to help understand the material or to dig deeper into the subject matter.  Updates to link locations are provided on the book’s web site.  Special Note for Teachers  The design of the content of this book provides flexibility in teaching styles and approaches. Each college  and university approaches the initial education of programming concepts in different ways. This book  provides three different types of programming exercises, which allow teachers to pick and choose what  would work best in their environment. “Do It” exercises are provided in each chapter to allow the student to  gain hands-on experience with techniques shown by modifying existing examples to produce the desired  results. These exercises provide a level of confidence before the student attempts to program exercises at  the end of the chapters. In addition, a Term Project is provided that builds an application that uses the same  types of algorithms and programming techniques shown in the book.  Teaching tools, including test banks, course outline, and PowerPoint slides are available for use from   the book’s web site and from apress.com.

Fast, flexible, and pragmatic, PHP powers everything from your blog to the  most popular web sites in the world.” —www.php.net  Chapter Objectives Student Learning Outcomes  After completing this chapter, the student will be able to:  Successfully install a version of LAMP, WAMP, or MAMP   	 Understand the differences between LAMP, WAMP, and MAMP  	  	  	  	 Create an error-free simple PHP program  Search the Internet for troubleshooting problems  Explain the difference between a programming language and a scripting language  PHP 5.5+, PHP 7+, and PHP.NET Today, PHP  Hypertext Preprocessor  is one of the most popular languages used for web application  development. The language has evolved to allow the programmer to quickly develop well-formed error-free  programs using both procedural and objected-oriented programming techniques. It provides the ability  to use many preexisting libraries of code that either come with the basic installation or can be installed  within the PHP environment. This gives you multiple ways to complete a particular task. It provides more  flexibility than many other languages. The ease with which additional libraries of code can be added to the  environment is one of the many driving forces in its popularity.  Procedural language—A procedural programming language includes functions methods  that can be called from the main flow of the program. The flow of the program jumps to  the function method, executes the code within the module, and then returns to the next  statement in the main flow of the program. Some Procedural languages include a main  function method that automatically is called when the program is executed.

Steve Prettyman 2015  S. Prettyman, Learn PHP 7, DOI 10.1007 978-1-4842-1730-6_1  1   Chapter 1   an IntroduCtIon to php 7  Object-oriented language—An object-oriented language uses classes and objects. Classes  are  similar  to  blue  prints.  A  class  describes  what  an  object  can  contain,  including  properties variables  and  functions methods.  An  object  is  an  instance  of  a  class   like  a  building  that  has  been  created  from  a  blueprint .  Object-oriented  languages  provide  polymorphism,  encapsulation,  and  inheritance.  Objects  are  naturally  encapsulated  by  containing all related functions methods and properties variables within the object itself.  Polymorphism  allows duplicate method function names within object-oriented  objects.  However,  the  “signature”  must  be  different.  The  “signature”  is  the  combination  of  the  types  of  variables   numbers  and  characters   passed  into  the  method function  and  the  type of information passed out of a method function. For example, several add methods  could be created—one that only accepts integers  whole numbers , one that only accepts  floating point numbers  numbers with decimals , and one that accepts a combination.  The program will determine which method function to call by what has been passed into  the  method function.  Inheritance  in  object-oriented  programming  allows  an  object  to  inherit properties variables and functions methods from another object. The object can  also override those items inherited. This is similar to a child inheriting characteristics from  the parents. Object-oriented languages can also be event-driven. An event-driven program  will “sleep” until an event occurs. This is similar to an ATM machine program waiting for  a user to input an ATM card.  PHP is an open source language. As such, each version of the language is created using input from the   individuals who use it—the programmers themselves. This allows the language, over time, to evolve and  float into the direction that is driven by the users. From its first release in 1995 as a Personal Home Page Tool   PHP  by Rasmus Lerdorf, the versions have been released on the Internet with forums to provide users the  ability to make suggestions and even provide code changes and additions. Today www.php.net is the official  PHP web site.  Open  source  language—An  open  source  programming  language  is  developed  by  a  community of interested parties. The community accepts input from fellow programmers  for suggested upgrades and corrections. Several members of the community work together  to  present  proposals  and  to  make  changes  to  the  language.  Open  source  languages  are  “free”. A non-open source language  such as Microsoft C  is created and updated by a  company or major organization. Non-open source languages are not usually “free”.  2   Chapter 1   an IntroduCtIon to php 7  Figure 1-1.  PHP.NET  09 24 15   The www.php.net home page provides information on each of the latest releases of the language. It also   provides information on future releases, the features planned for those releases, and the planned release  dates. In addition, other related PHP information can be found, including links and information to major  PHP conferences.  Figure 1-2.  Get involved  09 24 15   3   Chapter 1   an IntroduCtIon to php 7  As mentioned, this site provides the ability for users to help with the future development of the   language. Users can get involved with testing beta versions and reporting errors or program bugs. Visitors  can also view documentation related to the development of possible future versions. This is a good way of  discovering future enhancements or security fixes before major announcements have been made to the  public.  Figure 1-3.

However, as you will note, only the language itself is provided. It is more common,  and recommended, that the beginning user use a WAMP  Windows, Apache, MySQL, PHP ; LAMP  Linux,  Apache, MySQL, PHP ; or MAMP  Mac, Apache, MySQL, PHP  package for initial installation. These  packages  which we will look at later  allow for easy installation of multiple products at the same time.  Otherwise, you have to run many separate installations, which can become complicated and error-prone   if incompatible versions are installed.  WAMP LAMP MAMP—Open source  free  combinations, including Apache Web Server,  MySQL,  and  PHP  for  a  specific  operating  system   Windows,  Linux,  and  Mac .  These  packages are open source. The combination of software is used for creating dynamic web  sites and web applications.  4   Chapter 1   an IntroduCtIon to php 7  Figure 1-4.  Documentation pages  09 24 15   One of the more important pages of the PHP web site is the documentation page. This page allows   users to search for descriptions and functionality of the language itself. You can also download the complete  documentation. However, since this is a “live” site, with possible changes occurring, the most current  information is best obtained by directly accessing it from the web site.  Figure 1-5.  The Manual  11 11 14   5   Chapter 1   an IntroduCtIon to php 7  You can use the manual as if it were a textbook by clicking through each link from the beginning.   The limited amount of explanation provided with each section of the manual might cause a beginner to  want to give up on programming and change interests to something ghastly like networking! The manual  does provide a great guide for experienced programmers, as the syntax of the language is similar to other  languages such as JavaScript, Perl, and Java.  Figure 1-6.  Search  11 11 14   On any page of the web site, the user can enter a term, an expression, or even a function name to find  more information. As the information is entered in search box, the web page will provide the user with one  or more options below the box for the user to select.  6   Chapter 1   an IntroduCtIon to php 7  Figure 1-7.  Echo  11 11 14   Once the user has selected an option  such as echo shown in Figure 1-7 , the results of the search  provide the user with a general description of the item requested, any inputs or outputs for a function   parameters , and example code.  Figure 1-8.  Echo code  11 11 14   7   Chapter 1   an IntroduCtIon to php 7  The example code provides explanations of the use of the function within the code itself by using   comments  indicated by the    and gold color in Figure 1-8 . The comments are not executable code. The  executable code is color-coded to highlight strings  red , variables  blue , keywords  green , and the PHP  opening and closing tags  blue . Color-coding helps make the code more readable. It also can make it easier  to find syntax errors when creating programs. Many PHP editors provide similar color schemes.  PHP 5.6+ and PHP 7+ With the release of the PHP 7 environment, great improvements have taken place. PHP 5.5+ has dramatically  improved security. In this book, we will use the newest PHP encryption tool “password hash” instead of MD5  which many current books use. Over the last several years, MD5 has proven to be vulnerable to hacking.  “PHP 7 is based on the PHPNG project  PHP Next-Gen , that was led by Zend to speed  up PHP applications. The performance gains realized from PHP 7 are huge! They vary  between  25%  and  70%  on  real-world  apps,  and  all  of  that  just  from  upgrading  PHP,  without having to change a single line of code!” —www.zend.com  PHP 7 also replaces fatal errors, which previously would crash a program, with exceptions that can be   handled within the program itself.  If you are migrating from a previous version of PHP to PHP 7, please review the following link:  http:  php.net manual en migration70.php  The code used in the examples in this book is compatible with PHP 7. Most examples are also   compatible with PHP 5.5 and PHP 5.6.  1.  Go to www.php.net. Search for information on the print and printf functions.   How are these functions similar? How are they different?  2.  How do you “join the team” and help with the creation of the next version of   PHP? Hint: Go to the “Get Involved” section of www.php.net, select “Guide for  Contributors,” and then find the “Join the team” link. Of course, the web site  changes, so you may need to find a different route to the information.  3.  Which ways can the www.php.net web site be useful for a beginning PHP   4.  What language is used to create PHP? Hint: The answer is somewhere on the   programmer?  www.php.net web site.  5.  Go to www.php.net. Search for the list of improvements and changes with PHP 7.   List those improvements and changes. Which of these do you think will affect a  beginning level programmer?  Do It                8   Chapter 1   an IntroduCtIon to php 7  PHP, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and Apache Web Server PHP is a scripting language. A scripting language is different than an actual programming language.  Programming languages  such as Java  are written by the programmer in an English-like syntax. The  program is compiled, which means it’s converted from the English syntax into machine code  0s and 1s .  This code is then executed  run  within a compatible operating system and hardware. Scripting languages  do not use a compiler. The first time the code is accessed it is interpreted line by line as the program is  executed.  You may wonder if this causes the code to be slower than compiled code. The answer is no. Once the   code has been executed once, the interpreted code stays in the memory of the computer, or server, for other  executions. If the programmer changes this code, a new version will replace the previous version in memory. JavaScript is also a scripting language. As you may be aware, JavaScript code can be seen within a web   browser by viewing the source, as shown in Figure 1-9.  Figure 1-9.  JavaScript, HTML, and CSS code from yahoo.com  11 11 14   9   Chapter 1   an IntroduCtIon to php 7  The source code displayed in Figure 1-9 is from www.yahoo.com and it shows a combination of several   languages, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The JavaScript code  displayed in black  is located  between script tags    and   . This JavaScript code will attempt  to create a cookie on your machine, if your browser allows cookies.  Figure 1-10.  The www.php.net source code  11 11 14   However, when we look at the www.php.net source code  in Figure 1-10 , we cannot see any PHP script   code. There are links to some PHP files present, but no actual PHP code is displayed. Why?  JavaScript code resides on the user's computer. It is interpreted and executed within the browser. PHP  code resides on a web server. The code is also interpreted and executed, but by the web server, not by the  browser. The results of executing the PHP code are returned to the browser, not to the actual code itself.   You may notice other formats for using php  such as:  , or   ;      Note  with php 7 these styles are no longer valid. there were actually depreciated previously, but still usuable.  <?php Print "Hello"; ?>  10   Chapter 1   an IntroduCtIon to php 7  You might guess that this code will display Hello. While this is correct, the question is, what processes   happen to produce this result?  If this code is placed in a file  such as hello.php  on a web server, we would use our web browser   to request this file by entering its name and location in the URL  address  box  such as http:  servera. com hello.php . The address entered instructs the browser to send an HTTP Get request to the web server   servera.com  to return the web page  hello.php .  Figure 1-11.  Requesting an HTML JavaScript web page  The web server receiving the request will determine that PHP code must first be interpreted and   executed. It determines this simply by looking at the file extension  .php  of the file requested. Any PHP code  within the file is then sent to the PHP processor for interpretation and execution. The results of the execution  of the code is returned to the web server, which in turn sends it  and any other HTML and or JavaScript  code  back to the browser. In this example, Hello would be returned and displayed by the browser. If we  then viewed the source code, as mentioned, we would only see the actual word Hello. We would not see any  HTML or PHP. Why? Because we did not send any HTML back to the browser.  Figure 1-12.  Requesting a web page with PHP code  You may be wondering if you can use this process to send back actual HTML  and or JavaScript  code to  create a dynamic web page. The answer is yes. The PHP print function will return any HTML  or JavaScript   code that has been placed between the "". The browser will interpret any code returned by the web server.  Print  function.  The  print  function  is  not  actually  a  function.  It  is  a  language  construct.  Functions require that strings be included in quotes when passed. Language constructs do  not require quotes around strings. However, it is still recommended. Print will pass whatever  has been passed into it to the browser. It will attempt to convert any item that is not a string  to string  text  format since all items displayed within a web page are in text format.  For more information, visit:   http:  php.net manual en function.print.php.   For a more in-depth explanation of the print command, visit the free “The New Boston”   thenewboston.com  video s  at:   https:  www.thenewboston.com videos.php?cat=11&video=16996.  11   Chapter 1   an IntroduCtIon to php 7  <?php Print " Hello "; ?>     Note    all links provided in this book can be accessed from http:  www.littleoceanwaves.com securephp.  If we change our code to the listing above, the browser will display Hello as an HTML header  h1 . The   disadvantage of using the print function is that the program will have no control over where the statement is  displayed on the web page. The statement will actually be displayed as the first line of code, even before any  other existing HTML tags. This might be okay if we are just returning a statement to the user, such as “Your  process has been completed”. However, this might not be acceptable if your goal is to format output at an  exact location on the page. There are other techniques and functions that we could choose to eliminate this  problem. However, it is beyond our current discussion.  Now that we know we must interpret and execute PHP code with the help of a web server, what server   should we use?  The Apache web server is the server that is most commonly used to host and handle PHP web page   requests. Like other web servers, Apache can also accept and return requests for other types of files, including  HTML, JavaScript, PERL, images, and RSS feeds. Apache, as mentioned, determines what processes need to  be completed from HTTP requests by first looking at the file extensions of the requested files.  Figure 1-13.  Apache.org web site  09 24 15   Apache, like PHP, is an open source product. All changes to the Apache web server are coordinated by  the Apache Software Foundation. ASP maintains the apache.org web site to provide users and developers  the ability to discover projects currently under development and the ability to download the latest versions  of Apache. However, as mentioned, downloading separate versions of PHP, Apache, and MySQL can cause  issues with incompatible versions. Unless you know what you are doing, it’s much wiser to download a  complete WAMP, LAMP, or MAMP version.  12   Chapter 1   an IntroduCtIon to php 7  Figure 1-14.  Apache’s Get Involved  09 24 15   The Apache Software Foundation also encourages all users of their products to keep up to date and to   get involved in the development of future products. Users are encouraged to join discussion and mailing  groups, test out new releases, and even help fix bugs or add new features to their products.  Do It                code?  code?  1.

What are some of the ways that you can become involved   with the development of Apache projects, even though you have limited  experience?  13   Chapter 1   an IntroduCtIon to php 7  PHP, Apache, and MySQL  What happens when a web page requests information from a database? Commonly databases are stored on servers that are separate from the web server itself. Does the request for data come from the web server or from the PHP processor? Since the SQL statements are contained within the PHP code itself, the PHP processor sends the SQL  statements to the Database Management System  MySQL  to be processed.  Figure 1-15.  Requesting a PHP web page that retrieves information from a MySQL database  SQL—Structured Query Language is a special language used to update, insert, or delete  data  from  a  DBMS   Database  Management  System .  A  DBMS  is  an  application  that  interacts with a program language and a database to update, insert, or delete data. The  DBMS uses SQL to interpret the required changes to the data within the database. For  more information on SQL, visit http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki SQL. For more information  on DBMS, visit http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Database.  The Apache server will first discover that PHP code must be interpreted. The PHP code will then be sent   to the PHP processor. The PHP processor interprets the code  line by line . While doing so, it will discover  that SQL statements must be executed against a database. The SQL statements are then transferred to the  appropriate Database Management System  DBMS  for processing. The DBMS will return the results of  the execution of the SQL statements to the PHP processor. The PHP processor will then use those results  to format output to be given to the Apache server. The Apache server will then combine the results of what  is returned by the PHP processor with any other HTML  and or JavaScript  code that might reside on the  original page requested and return all output to the browser on the user’s machine. The browser will then  interpret the HTML and JavaScript to display the results of the page requested.  Did you catch all of that? Let’s look at a “real-world” example, shown in Figure 1-16.  Figure 1-16.  Google.com search for “green cats”  11 12 14   14   For some very strange reason we have decided to look up “green cats” on the Internet. As we enter  the string into our favorite search engine  Google in this example  and then click the Search button, the  information is passed to a Google server farm somewhere. Where?  Who knows; it could be anywhere on the planet. But the power of the Internet is that we don’t care as   long as we get our results back quickly.  Chapter 1   an IntroduCtIon to php 7  Figure 1-17.  Green cats  11 12 14   Okay, I must say I am amazed that there are 104 million possible links to green cats. Wow. Maybe we   should have filtered that down some. The point, however, is that Google returns a web page with a listing of  links and descriptions of those links  plus ads .  Did Google return a static page that already existed? No. The servers created a dynamic page from the request of the user. The Google algorithms  software    searched the massive Google database farms. The request was first sent to a Google web server from the  user’s browser. The web server then sent a request to the Google databases  actually using a Google Query  Language similar to SQL  to return information about “green cats”. The software on the web server then  compiled the results, added HTML and JavaScript  also some Google Script Language code  for formatting  the results web page, and returned the information to the user.  Static  vs.  dynamic  web  pages—A  static  web  page  does  not  change  in  relation  to  user  requests or input. The page is created by a web developer and resides on the web server.  When the user requests the page via a browser, a copy of the page is sent to the browser  for display. A dynamic page does not exist within a web server. The page is created using  input from the user. A program residing on the web server will create and format the page.  The page that is created by the program is then downloaded to the user’s browser. A copy  of the page is not  usually  maintained on the web server. For more information on static  web pages visit http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Static_web_page. For more information on  dynamic web pages visit: http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Dynamic_web_page.  15   Chapter 1   an IntroduCtIon to php 7  Did every page get downloaded to the user’s web browser? No, just the first page. The page links at the bottom of the first results page return information to the web   server requesting the next set of information  to dynamically create the second page, or another requested  page . As you might now be starting to figure out, the same process we have just discussed related to  processing PHP files on the Internet is a very common process for creating dynamic pages.  Your might have noticed something interesting about the results page URL address that was displayed.   The address is now https:  www.google.com ?gws_rd=sslq=Green+Cats, not www.google.com.   Google algorithms use the GET HTTP Request when sending search requests to their servers.  HTTP—Hypertext Transfer Protocol is the protocol  standard  for transferring messages   text  and  web  pages   between  nodes   computers  and  servers   on  the  Internet.  It  is  a  request-response protocol. For example, a user “requests” a web page though a browser.  The web server “responds” to the request and returns the page to the browser. The browser  changes the request into an HTTP Get Request  such as GET  pages mypage.html HTTP 1.1   that  is  sent  to  the  web  server.  The  web  server  responds  with  the  information  requested  and  a  status  code   such  as  HTTP 1.1  200  OK .  For  more  information  on  HTTP,  visit    http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Hypertext_Transfer_ProtocolRequest_methods.    Name:         Let’s look at a simpler example above to discover what occurs. Assume the code above is saved in an   index.html file on your localhost web site under the projects folder.  Figure 1-18.  Index.html example  If the user enters Fred in the textbox displayed in the browser, the results page  created by interpreting   and executing the searchprocess.php file on the web server and sending the results back to the browser   will display the URL line : http:  127.0.0.1 projects searchprocess.php?customername=Fred.  Figure 1-19.  Execution of searchprocess.php  16   Chapter 1   an IntroduCtIon to php 7  The name of the textbox  customername  and the value entered in the textbox  Fred  are now visible on   the URL line. Actually, customername is now a parameter and Fred is now the value the parameter holds.  This is the result of using the GET process.  When we click the Google Search button or the Search button in our simple example, the requested  information is send via the GET HTTP process. All information  and variables  needed for the receiving  program are sent on the actual URL line to be received by the program on the web server that will process  the initial request.  Why does the Google search engine send information via GET instead of POST  which would have   hidden the information ?  The main reason is to save server memory. Just think of the millions of requests that Google has for   information. If all of these requests resided in memory, the servers would soon crash. Also, since the user is  doing a “public” search for information, there is no reason to hide the information. In later chapters, we will  discover how to read both GET and POST parameters within PHP programs.  However, for now let’s get back to our discussion of Apache, PHP, and DBMS. PHP can access information from many types of DBMS systems, including Oracle and SQL Server.   However, the most popular combination  as mentioned already  is to pair PHP with MySQL. I bet at this point  you can guess why? Yes, it’s open source and free. MySQL is also one of the easier DBMS systems to use.  Figure 1-20.  www.mysql.com  09 24 15   Just like all the open source products we have discussed, the user can go to the official web site     www.mysql.com  to download the latest versions. Also, as you can probably guess, you can join in on the fun  of helping to develop new versions of MySQL and related products. Documentation of current and several  previous versions are available for download. The documentation is pretty intense and not for the weak of  mind or the beginner. Also, as you probably are tired of reading it is not recommended that you download a  new version of MySQL individually until you have more experience. Stick with the WAMP, LAMP, and MAMP  packages, at least for now.  17   Chapter 1   an IntroduCtIon to php 7  Do It             1.  Why does the PHP processor send SQL to the DBMS instead of the Apache web   server sending it directly to the DBMS?  2.  What might Apache do with the information received from the DBMS before   sending it back to the user’s browser?  3.  Go to www.mysql.com. What is the latest version of MySQL? Which versions of   Apache and PHP are compatible?  4.  Why do search engines pass information via GET HTTP requests instead of POST   HTTP requests? When would you use a POST request?  Putting it All Together—PHP, Apache, and MySQL  As you have hopefully discovered by this point, PHP, Apache, and MySQL need to run seamlessly together to  successfully create dynamic web pages. There are numerous development packages available that provide  a combination of these products, along with other tools such as PhpMyAdmin  which is a great help in  setting up your web server and databases . By installing one of these products, you will greatly reduce your  frustration level and maybe even manage to keep most of your hair. We will briefly look at two of the most  popular; EasyPHP and XAMPP. We will not dive in-depth or provide step-by-step install directions for two  reasons. As soon as this book is published the directions probably will change, and it’s fine to use the default  settings. Accepting what the developers suggest works most of the time.  EasyPHP  Figure 1-21.  www.easyphp.org  09 24 15   18   Chapter 1   an IntroduCtIon to php 7  You can download the developer’s version of EasyPHP from the following link. It is not necessary to   download the host version unless you are planning on hosting “live” web pages directly from your computer  onto the Internet.  http:  www.easyphp.org easyphp-devserver.php  The developer's version of EasyPHP is a WAMP  Windows, Apache, MySQL, PHP  package that’s used in   the Microsoft Windows environment. There are additional tools that you can choose to also install to assist  in development. However, for our purposes you need only the basic install. After installation, the files will be  located in your program files directory under the EasyPHP directory.     Warning  pay attention to which buttons you click on the web site during download. You might download  extra items you are not interested in if you don't read what you are downloading before you click the button s .  After downloading the installer by clicking the download arrow on the web site, follow the directions  provided with the software. On your first attempt, leave all the default settings. Hopefully, everything will  install correctly. If not, read the next section entitled, “Common Installation Problems”.  Common Installation Problems Missing C Library PHP 7  and earlier versions of PHP  require the Microsoft Visual Studio C library. If you have Windows 8 or  later, this library is probably already installed. Also, if you have a recent version of Microsoft Visual Studio, it  is also probably already installed. If you receive an error indicating that C is missing or the wrong version,  paste the message into a search engine on the Internet. Search for a response from Microsoft for directions to  fix the error. The response should include a link to download the missing files and installation instructions.  Port Conflicts If you already have a service using port 80, the default port for HTML traffic between your PC and the outside  world, you will receive an error message from Apache when it attempts to run. You can fix this problem in  multiple ways.  Wikipedia defines a port as:  In  computer  networking,  a  port  is  an  application-specific  or  process-specific  software  construct serving as a communications endpoint in a computer's host operating system.  The  purpose  of  ports  is  to  uniquely  identify  different  applications  or  processes  running  on a single computer and thereby enable them to share a single physical connection to  a  packet-switched  network  like  the  Internet.  In  the  context  of  the  Internet  Protocol,  a  port is associated with an IP address of the host, as well as the type of protocol used for  communication.  For more information on ports, visit:   http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Port_ computer_networking .  19   A. If you don’t mind shutting down other services using the port while you are developing, you can   follow the directions below. Once you are done using Apache and PHP, you can turn the services back on or  just reboot your PC and the services will turn back on.  1.  Go to the Microsoft Windows 7 8 10 Task Manager  press Ctrl+Alt+Delete at the   Chapter 1   an IntroduCtIon to php 7           same time .  2.   Select the Services tab.  3.  Look for any of the following services in Windows 7 8 10. If you find one   running, right-click it and turn it off. Then try restarting Apache again. If that  does not work, turn that one back on and try another one.  The names may be  slightly different depending on the version of Windows.   SQL Server Reporter, Web Deployment Agent, BranchCache, Sync Share Service,  WAS  IIS Administrator , and W3SVC  B. If you need your other services running or you do not have the administrative privileges to turn off   services on port 80, you can change the default listening port location for Apache.  Go to your system tray  bottom-right corner of your screen . Find the EasyPHP icon by scrolling over   the icons. A description of each should appear. If you don’t see the icon, click the up arrow in the system tray  to see more icons. Right-click the EasyPHP icon. Select Configuration and then select Apache. This will open  the Apache configuration file  httpd.conf  into Notepad  or your default text editor . First save a copy of this  file somewhere in case you make an error. This will allow you to recover from any major mistakes that occur.  Then search for Listen 127.0.0.1:80 within the file. Change the occurrence of 80 to 8080 or to 81; on that  line only. This will allow the Apache server to listen to one of the ports that are not commonly used. Resave  the file  make sure you are resaving the original file to the original location .   Make sure when you’re using notepad or any other text editor that you use Save as, and then select      Note  all Files for the file type. also make sure to include the .conf file extension. If you do not change the file type  to all files, your file will be saved as httpd.conf.txt. If that happens, the server will not see the file. You can  easily fix the problem by reopening the file and saving it in the proper method.  You can then restart Apache by going back to your system tray to find the EasyPHP icon. Double-click  the icon; a message box will appear that will give you the status Apache and MySQL. You will probably see  red for the Apache status. Click the Apache button. Within a few moments, it should turn green. This will  indicate that the server is now running. Do the same for MySQL.  Missing Files If you receive an error message related to this, somehow your files have become corrupted before  installation. Return to the EasyPHP web site and download the files again. Also, if you somehow mess up the  Apache configuration file, go back and reinstall the product again.  Can’t Install Files In Program Files Directory This indicates that you or something else has a high security restriction on that directory. Rerun the  installation and change the location of your installation to another directory. Just remember, when we  reference the program files directory later in this book, that you should instead look at the directory in which  your files were installed.  20   Chapter 1   an IntroduCtIon to php 7  Apache Delays and Hang-ups In Windows 8 10 you may experience problems with Apache working slowly or hanging-up. To correct this  problem go to your system tray  bottom-right corner of your screen . Find the EasyPHP icon by scrolling  over the icons. A description of each should appear. If you don’t see the icon, click the up arrow in the  system tray to see more icons. Right-click the EasyPHP icon. Select Configuration and then select Apache.  This will open the Apache configuration file  httpd.conf  into Notepad  or your default text editor . First  save a copy of this file somewhere in case you make an error. This will allow you to recover from any major  mistakes that occur.  Then add the following two lines to the bottom of the file.   AcceptFilter http none  AcceptFilter https none   Resave the file  make sure you are resaving the original file to the original location .   Other Errors For errors that have not been discussed here, copy and paste the error into a search engine. Locate an  answer column or blog that provides suggestions to fix your error. There are many free resources on the  Internet. Do not pay for a web site  or someone else  to fix your problem.  Configurations You need to determine when you want Apache to run. Apache can be set to run when you boot your PC,  when an application needs it, or manually. To change settings, you can right-click the EasyPHP Icon in the  system tray  bottom-right corner of your screen , then select Configuration and then select EasyPHP. If you  don’t see the icon, click the up arrow in the system tray. A small screen should appear that will allow you to  check  or uncheck  two options—Start on Session Startup and Launch Servers When the Application Starts.  There are many optional libraries that you can link or unlink to PHP as needed. In many cases the  libraries are already loaded and just need to be linked. You can add these libraries by going to the PHP  configuration file  php.ini  and removing the comment  ;  character at the beginning of the line. The  PHP configuration file can easily be found by right-clicking the EasyPHP icon in the system tray. Then  select Configuration and PHP. It is not necessary to make any changes at this point. It is also suggested that  you make these changes only when needed. Other libraries can be added using Curl and other methods  discussed in later chapters of this book.

XAMPP at www.apachefriends.org  09 24 15   Although XAMPP is similar to EasyPHP, XAMPP is more popular because it has free Windows,   Linux, and OS X versions. It also includes a lot of add-ons, including some of the most popular content  management systems—Drupal, Joomla, and WordPress. The latest downloads can be accessed directly at  the official XAMPP web site or at many other download locations.  https:  www.apachefriends.org      Warning  pay attention to what buttons you click on the web site. You might download extra items you are  not interested in if you don't read what you are downloading before you click the button s .  During your first attempt at installing, use the default settings that the developers have suggested in the  installation software. You will greatly reduce the possibility of problems or headaches. If you do have errors,  read the next section entitled “Common Installation Problems” for assistance.  Common Installation Problems Port Conflicts If you already have a service using port 80, the default port for HTML traffic between your PC and the outside  world, you will receive an error message from Apache when it attempts to run. You can fix this problem in  multiple ways.  22   A. If you don’t mind shutting down other services using the port while you are developing, you can   follow the directions on the video link. Once you are done using Apache and PHP you can turn the services  back on or just reboot your PC and the services will turn back on.  1.  Go to the Windows 7 8 10 Task Manager  press Ctrl+Alt+Delete at the same   Chapter 1   an IntroduCtIon to php 7           time .  2.   Select the Services tab.  3.  Look for any of the following services in Windows 7 8 10. If you find one   running, right-click it and turn it off. Then try restarting Apache again. If that  does not work, turn that one back on and try another one.  The names may be  slightly different depending on the version of Windows.   SQL Server Reporter, Web Deployment Agent, BranchCache, Sync Share Service,  WAS  IIS Administrator , and W3SVC  B. If you need your other services running or you do not have the administrative privileges to turn off   services on port 80, you can change the default listening port location for Apache.  Go to your system tray  in Microsoft Windows it’s at the bottom-right corner of your screen . Find the  XAMPP icon by scrolling your mouse over the icons. A description of each should appear. If you don’t see  the icon, click the up arrow in the system tray to see more icons. Double-click the icon. The Control Panel  should appear. You should see start up error messages in red on the console. If it is a port conflict, click the  Config button to the right of Apache. Select httpd.conf from the list provided. This will open the Apache  configuration file  httpd.conf  into Notepad  or your default text editor . First save a copy of this file  somewhere in case you make a mistake. This will allow you to recover the original file. Search for Listen 80  within the file. Change the occurrence of 80 to 8080 or to 81. This will allow the Apache server to listen to one  of these ports that are not commonly used. Resave the file  make sure you are resaving the original file to the  original location .   Make sure when using notepad or any other text editor that you use Save as, then select all Files for      Note  the file type. also make sure to include the .conf file extension. If you do not change the file type to all Files,  your file will be saved as httpd.conf.txt. If that happens, the server will not see the file. You can easily fix the  problem by reopening the file and saving it in the proper method.  You can then restart Apache by clicking the Start button next to Apache in the XAMPP console. If you get  a green status for Apache, you will also want to start MySQL by clicking the Start button to the right of MySQL.  Missing Files If you receive an error message related to this, somehow your files have become corrupted before  installation. Return to the XAMPP web site and download the files again. If you somehow have messed up  the Apache configuration file, you also will need to download the files again.  Can’t Install Files in Program Files Directory This would indicate that you or something else has a high security restriction on that directory. Rerun the  installation and change the location of your installation to another directory. Just remember, when you  reference the program files directory later in this book, that you should instead look at the directory in which  your files were installed.  23   Chapter 1   an IntroduCtIon to php 7  Apache Delays and Hang-ups In Windows 8 10 you may experience problems with Apache working slowly or hanging-up. To correct this  problem go to your system tray  bottom-right corner of your screen . Find the XAMPP icon by scrolling over  the icons. A description of each should appear. If you don’t see the icon, click the up arrow in the system tray  to see more icons. Right-click the XAMPP icon. Select Configuration and then select Apache. This will open  the Apache configuration file  httpd.conf  into Notepad  or your default text editor . First save a copy of this  file somewhere in case you make an error. This will allow you to recover from any major mistakes that occur.  Then add the following two lines to the bottom of the file.   AcceptFilter http none  AcceptFilter https none  Resave the file  make sure you are resaving the original file to the original location .  Other Errors For errors that have not been discussed here, copy and paste the error into a search engine. Locate an  answer column or blog that provides suggestions to fix your error. There are many free resources on the  Internet. Do not pay for a web site  or someone else  to fix you problem.  Configurations You can change configurations for XAMPP by going to the Control Panel  double-click the XAMPP on the  system tray at the bottom-right of your screen . Then click on the config button at the upper-right of your  screen  not the config buttons to the right of the applications . You can then check  or uncheck  those  applications that you want to have automatically start the next time the Control Panel starts. You should  check Apache and MySQL for the lessons in this book. Of course, you can always start them from the Control  Panel when needed.  There are many optional libraries that you can link or unlink to PHP as needed. In many cases, the  libraries are already loaded and just need to be linked. You can add these libraries by going to the PHP  configuration file  php.ini  and remove the comment  ;  character at the beginning of the line. The PHP  configuration file can easily be found by double-clicking the XAMPP icon in the system tray. Then click  the Config button to the right of Apache. A list will display; select php.ini. It is not necessary to make any  changes at this point. It is also suggested that you make these changes only when needed. Other libraries can  be added using Curl and other methods discussed in later chapters of this book.  Microsoft Internet Information Server Alternatively, if you are unable to get Apache to perform properly in Windows  especially Windows 8  or Windows 10 , or you like Microsoft’s IIS Server, you can install PHP to use Microsoft IIS  Internet  Information Server  instead of Apache.

Use a search engine to answer this question: You receive the following error   either while installing or as soon as you try to start XAMMP or EasyPHP. How can  you find the solution to your problem? What might be causing this error?  Internal Server Error The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was  unable to complete your request. Please contact the server administrator, you@example.com and inform  them of the time the error occurred, and anything you might have  done that may have caused the error. More information about this error may be available in the server  error log.  2.  Use a search engine to answer this question: What is XAMPP error 1130? How   can you fix this error?  3.  Use a search engine to answer this question: When trying to run a PHP program   using EasyPHP  and Apache  you receive the error below. What is causing this  error? How can you fix it?  Cannot load mcrypt extension. Please check your PHP configuration.  4.   If you have not already attempted to do so, install either EasyPHP or XAMPP on  your personal machine. Did you have any problems with your installation? If so,  what problems did you have? How did you solve those problems?  Testing Your Environment  You have green lights now, right? Everything is working correctly?  Well, hopefully. However, you need to make sure. The best way to do this is to test your environment.  Testing Your Administration Environment First we need to test the server and see if our administration pages will display. In EasyPHP, you can do  either of the following:  1.  Right-click on the EasyPHP icon and select Administration.  2.  Open your favorite browser and enter the following:  http:  127.0.0.1 home   25   Chapter 1   an IntroduCtIon to php 7  If you had to change your port due to conflicts, you may need to enter the port number, such as:  http:  127.0.0.1:8080 home   You should see a screen similar to the one shown in Figure 1-23.  Figure 1-23.  EasyPHP administration screen  PHP 5.6   For XAMPP, open your favorite browser and enter this address:  http:  127.0.0.1 dashboard   If you had to change your port due to conflicts, then you must also include this port:  http:  127.0.0.1:8080 dashboard   26   If XAMPP is installed properly, you should see a screen similar to the one shown in Figure 1-24.  Chapter 1   an IntroduCtIon to php 7  Figure 1-24.  XAMPP dashboard screen  09 24 15   If at this point you are not seeing this page  or some page with XAMPP displayed , something is wrong.   Check the following:  Is EasyPHP or XAMPP running  started ? Do you see the green light or green shaded color for Apache   either in the XAMPP Control Panel or in EasyPHP? If not, try clicking the start buttons or links.  If Apache will not start, are you seeing an error message? If not, check the error log file. For EasyPHP,   right-click the icon on the system tray and select the error log file for Apache. For XAMPP, click the Log  button on the Control Panel next to Apache and select Error Log.  If you see green and the pages seem to be locked up, try stopping and restarting Apache. If might take a   couple of attempts to wake it up. If it continues to hang, check your computer settings. Are you maxing out  on CPU usage?  Can you determine the problem? If you have an error message, paste it in your favorite search engine   and see what the experts say about the problem.  Do It 1.     If you have not already done so, test your environment using the   directions above. Did you have any problems? If so, what problems occurred?  How did you fix those problems?  27   Chapter 1   an IntroduCtIon to php 7  Testing Your PHP Environment Hopefully everything is good at this point. Either you have been flying through with great luck, or you  managed to fix all the problems you have encountered. However, you still need to see if you can actually run  your own PHP program in Apache.  Open a text editor  not Word, but Notepad or Notepad++ are good , and enter the following code   exactly as it has been shown.  <?php print "Hello World"; ?>  Figure 1-25.  Using Save As with All Files to save PHP programs  Using the Save As selection on the File menu, change the File Type to All Files or to php. Enter the file   name myfirstprogram.php and save it in one of the locations below.  If you are using EasyPHP, save it to:  C:\Program Files  x86 \EasyPHP-DevServer-14.1VC11\data\localweb\projects  Of course, you should change the version name  or Program File name  to the correct version  location    that you are using on your machine. If you have a version of EasyPHP that does not have the localweb\ projects folders, find the location of the www folder under the EasyPHP folder and create a folder called  projects. Then save the file under that folder.  If you are using XAMPP, first go to C:\xampp\htdocs and create a folder called projects. Then go back   to your text editor, choose Save As  don’t forget to change the file type to All Files or php , name the file  myfirstprogram.php and save it to the location below.  C:\xampp\htdocs\projects  28   Chapter 1   an IntroduCtIon to php 7  If you saved your files correctly in the EasyPHP or XAMPP locations, you can attempt to run your   program by entering the following in your browser URL box.  http:  127.0.0.1 projects myfirstprogram.php  If you changed the port, then change the first part to http:  127.0.0.1:8080   enter the correct port   you are using in place of 8080 .  Your program should display the message shown in Figure 1-26.  Figure 1-26.  Hello World  Common Problems  Nothing is displayed, error 404:                                1.  Make sure you typed the address exactly as shown.  2.  Your server might be hung up. Stop and restart it.  3.  Make sure you placed your file in the correct location.  4.  Make sure you saved your file as a .php file and not as .txt. Try Save As again   and renaming the file  make sure file type is either All Files or  php .  5.  Check for typos in your actual program code. Did you remember the semicolon  ; ?    Fix any and resave. You might need to stop and start the server if it does not see  the changes for some reason. You can go to the log files and look at the PHP log  files to see any errors that might exist in your code.  6.  Go to the Apache log files  see directions in previous common problems  to look  for errors. If you cannot correct them, copy the errors and paste them in a search  engine to see what others have found as solutions.  The actual program code is displayed not the results of executing the code:  1.  Make sure you saved your file as a .php file and not as .txt. Try Save As again   and renaming the file  make sure file type is either All Files or php .  2.  Your Apache server or PHP might not be started or is hung. Stop and start   Apache again.  3.  Did you forget or have a typo in the   lines?  4.  Go to the Apache log files  see directions in previous common problems  to find  the errors. If you cannot correct them, copy the errors and paste them in a search  engine to see what others have found as solutions.  For any other errors, copy and paste them into a web search engine to see what others have discovered   as a solution.  29   Chapter 1   an IntroduCtIon to php 7  EasyPHP’s Code Classroom If you are still having problems getting a version of LAMP, MAMP, or WAMP to work on your computer, all is  not lost.  EasyPHP  www.easyphp.org  now has an online coding environment for students and teachers. This   environment  see Figure 1-27  allows you to enter code  black window below , click a Submit button    red button , and see your results on the right  white window .  Figure 1-27.  www.codeclassroom.net  Do It 1.     Alias Directories  If you have not already tested your environment, do so. Did the test work? What  problems, if any, did you have? How did you solve those problems?  It is common practice in the real world to create alias directories in web servers. Alias directories are “fake”  locations of files that trick the user of your web site into believing a file is in one location when it is in  another.  Why would you use an alias directory? As web sites grow, the locations of files on servers may have  to change. By using an alias the user of your web site will not know that the actual location of the file has  changed. The alias gives you the ability to store your files in any location on your computer  server . If you  are not using an alias all your files must be stored in the default location. The default locations are:  EasyPHP: C:\Program Files  x86 \EasyPHP-DevServer-14.1VC11\data\localweb\ XAMPP: C:\xampp\htdocs\  30   Chapter 1   an IntroduCtIon to php 7  You might want to consider creating an alias directory, especially if you want to locate your files on a  jump drive. In this book, we assume that files are located under the default locations in a projects folder.  EasyPHP: C:\Program Files  x86 \EasyPHP-DevServer-14.1VC11\data\localweb\projects XAMPP: C:\xampp\htdocs\projects  This will allow us to test programs using the same URL whether we are using EasyPHP or XAMPP.  http:  127.0.0.1 projects myfirstprogram.php  If you do create an alias directory, just remember to replace projects with whatever alias name you   are using.  Figure 1-28.  EasyPHP alias screen  In EasyPHP, alias directories can be created from the Administration screen. Go to the system tray   bottom-right of your screen , right-click the EasyPHP icon, and select Administration. In the middle of  the screen, locate Local Files, and then locate the Add an Alias button to the right. Click and follow the  directions. Before adding your alias, the folder must already exist.  31   Chapter 1   an IntroduCtIon to php 7  Figure 1-29.  The httpd-xampp file  In XAMPP, it takes a little more work. Open the system panel by double-clicking the XAMPP icon.    Then click the Config button to the right of Apache. Select the httpd-xampp configuration file from the list.  Choose Edit. Find from your text editor menu. Search for the string ' '. Do not  change anything that is already listed in this section. However, you can add locations  using the following  code  for your executable files. Once you have entered the required lines, stop and start Apache to help it  find the new changes.  Alias  myfiles "C: Temp"   Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews ExecCGI   AllowOverride All   Require all granted    For more information on creating alias directories, visit:   https:  www.youtube.com watch?v=XX6t3zJRXF8.     Note  this directory setting allows complete read and write capability to the directory. We will discuss  options to secure the directory for “live” sites in a later chapter.   32   Chapter 1   an IntroduCtIon to php 7  Figure 1-30.  Hello World running from the alias directory called myfiles as an index.php file  This listing would allow any files in the C: Temp directory to execute in Apache when the user enters  myfiles as a directory name in the URL line. The directory settings provided don't provide much security.  However, this is just for testing on a test machine. If you are in a live environment, you would need to  tighten the security settings under the directory tag. To execute the files within this directory, you would  enter the URL http:  127.0.0.1 myfiles in a browser. If you do not include a file name, Apache will  try to find an index.html or index.php file. If neither exists, Apache will list the files in the directory,  with the current settings. This allows easy access to files for testing. However, it is not a good idea in a live  environment. You can request a file that is not the index file by adding the file name  http:  127.0.0.1  myfiles myfirstprogram.php . Remember to include the port number if you had to change it   http:  127.0.0.1:8080 myfiles myfirstprogram.php . Of course, the directory must exist and the files  must be in the directory before you test the URL in a browser.  Do It    1.  Create an alias folder called myfiles that points to an existing location on your  hard drive or jump drive. Place the hello world program that you used to test  your environment in the folder. Try to run the program from the folder using the  previous instructions. Were you successful? If not, what problems did you have?  How did you fix those problems?  Notepad++, Editors, and Code Testers  When creating PHP code, you do not need to use a specific editor or purchase an editor. You can create all  code within a text editor  even in Notepad . However, it does help to have an editor that highlights  colors   your code to make it easier to discover coding  syntax  errors.  33   Chapter 1   an IntroduCtIon to php 7  Notepad++  Figure 1-31.  Hello World inside Notepad++  Notepad++ is available for download at www.notepad-plus-plus.org. This editor is basic and easy to  use. It can create files in over 20 different forms  including PHP . Most of the coding examples provided in  this book are created with Notepad++. When you’re creating a new PHP program in Notepad++, you must  tell the application the file type. You can do this by choosing the Language menu item and then choosing  PHP. This will allow the application to help you with color-coding and other features.  Other Editors There are hundreds of other editors available. I suggest you pick one that you are most comfortable using;  www.download.com is a good site to find PHP free editors. Pick one that has lots of users and a strong rating.  As mentioned previously, you may want to also try EasyPHP’s code classroom at: www.codeclassroom.net  34   Chapter 1   an IntroduCtIon to php 7  Do It    1.  Decide on a text editor that you will use to complete your coding while using this  book. Download the editor to your PC. Retype your hello world program in the  editor and save the program. Run the program from your browser. Why did you  choose the editor that you downloaded? What do you like about the editor? What  do you not like about the editor?

The ease at which it interfaces with HTML and JavaScript provides the ability for PHP applications to run on  any system that can host a browser. More and more applications are now being created using browsers as the  main interface tool for the application. This allows the application to run on PCs, the Internet, and even in  smart phones without the requirement of installing the actual application  or other software  on the device.  It also allows users to experience the same “feel” for the application when they switch between devices. In the following sections, we will take a brief look at some of the platforms and containers that can   host PHP applications. We will use the words platform and container interchangeably. In this discussion we  consider a platform or container a software tool that “hosts” the PHP program and any output returned by  executing the program.

However, the  skills needed to create these applications require an in-depth understanding of communication between  operating systems and event-driven PHP programs. These advanced skills are beyond the concepts shown  in this introductory book. However, some might also argue that the skills needed to accomplish this are  unnecessary since a PHP program can run within any browser residing in any operating system.  PHP PC applications do have the ability to “create once” and “run anywhere,” as with other languages    such as Java . PHP PC applications can be created to require no  or little  code changes between PC  operating systems and hardware platforms.  The GTK SDK  Software Development Kit  is one of several tools that can be used for PC application   development. If you visit the web site  http:  gtk.php.net  , you can find information on the latest version  and future development.  If you are curious about PHP PC application development, try the link below or search in  your browser for “PHP GTK Tutorial”.  http:  www.developertutorials.com building-desktop-applications-in-php-8-02-01   PHP Smart Phone Applications PHP can also be used to create smart phone apps. Usually this occurs as an attempt to retrofit a current web  application to the smart phone environment. Smart phone application development requires advanced  skills in developing communication links between your program and the smart phone operating system.  Smart phone apps may be necessary to use some of the features built into the smart phone operating   system  such as GPS . All smart phone operating systems provide API  Application Program Interface  calls  that allow applications residing on the phone to use these features. Although web applications  discussed  later in this chapter  can run in a browser on a smart phone, they cannot make API calls to the smart phone  operating system  since they are not hosted within the phone itself . If the application requires the ability to  interface with the smart phones operating system, it must reside on the smart phone.  Developing smart phone applications require advanced programming skills and an in-depth knowledge   of the smart phone operating systems. Some of this hassle can be reduced by using one of the free smart  phone SDKs  Software Development Kits  available today. Some SDKs now provide the ability to convert  applications for use on multiple operating systems.  You should have good basic PHP skills before attempting to create smart phone applications.  PHP Facebook and Other Social Applications PHP can be used to create applications  and games  that are hosted in the Facebook Canvas Platform and  other social applications  such as Twitter . The techniques used in these applications are similar. We will  take a brief look at the Facebook Canvas as an example.  Applications can uses tools in Facebook itself  such as the Facebook Login  using API  Application  Program Interface  calls. For example, an application can use Facebook tools to monitor the use of the  application. When a user signs in to an application  or game  using the Facebook sign-in, the user must  acknowledge and accept the security levels necessary to run the program. By accepting these settings, the  user is giving the application permission to make API calls to retrieve information  and may be change  information  from the user’s Facebook environment.  You can create PHP applications that are merely hosted by Facebook that do not require the knowledge   of API programming. Many advertisements that include click-through ability for more information are hosted  in the Canvas but actually reside on a web server located somewhere else on the Internet. The Facebook   40   Chapter 2   InterfaCes, platforms, ContaIners, and three-tIer programmIng  Canvas does have the ability to interpret HTML and JavaScript code. This enables the developer to create an  application that could both be displayed in the Canvas and externally in a browser.  Let’s take a brief look at how you could host an application in the Facebook Canvas. You will keep the development in “developer’s” mode. This simply means that when you have   completed the demo, everyone in Facebook will not be able to access the application. There are additional  steps you must go through to make your application ‘live’  see developers.facebook.com for details .     Warning  facebook constantly changes its security settings and apI  application programmer Interface .  some of the following steps might slightly change over time. If you find these steps do not work, search the  Internet for “a simple php facebook app” and check the creation date of the tutorial or videos to ensure that  you have the most up-to-date information.  Do It Complete the following:     1.  For this example, you need to use your browser to search for an existing secure   web page  one that uses https instead of http . Facebook no longer allows   non-secured web pages to be hosted in the Canvas. Since this is a PHP book, it  would be preferable to find a web application that includes PHP code  one that  has a file ending of php instead of html . However, you can use an HTML site for  this example. Remember, this is just for demonstration and educational purposes.  You should always request permission to host a web site in another site  such as  Facebook Canvas . All web sites are assumed to be protected by copyright laws   even when there is no indication on the site that they are copyrighted .  Note: Some sites are secured to not allow their site to be hosted in another site.   If you follow these directions and the site does not display, that may be the cause.  If that happens, search for another secured web page.  You could elect to use your own web page  such as the hello world example .  However, the web page will need a hosting environment  besides your PC .  Facebook cannot interface with your localhost development environment.  There are many low-price hosting sites now available; some for as little as $1 a  month. Most hosting companies enable you to have secured sites  using https .  However, there is usually an additional fee for this service.  When picking a host site, make sure to read the fine print to determine if it will  host PHP applications. It is a good idea to have a hosting site for you to upload  your test programs. Programs should be tested in multiple environments.  Sometimes programs react differently in different environments.  If you have your own secure URL, or one that your school allows you to use,  upload your Hello World program onto the host. Then test it to make sure it still  works in the host and make sure that you know the actual URL address that will  run the program.  41   Chapter 2   InterfaCes, platforms, ContaIners, and three-tIer programmIng  2.   Sign in to Facebook  www.facebook.com . If you do not have a Facebook user  ID password, you can create one for free. This demo does not require you to  completely build a Facebook page. If you have an existing account, you might  consider creating an extra account  with a different e-mail address  just for your  development needs.  3.  Once you are signed in to Facebook, go to the developer’s page     developers.facebook.com . Find the Menu on the page. Select Apps, and then  select Add New App. A screen similar to the one shown in Figure 2-1 will appear.  Locate and select the Facebook Canvas option.  Figure 2-1.  Selecting Canvas from Facebook developer’s page  11 17 14    Remember that Facebook does change their screens. However, the sign-in process should be similar to   this demo.   The next screen requires you to enter a name for your application. Any unique name is fine since this   application will not become live. You might also be prompted with some other questions related to whether  this app is part of another app  no  and you may be requested to select a category  Apps for Pages would  be fine . Once you have filled  and selected  the required information click the Create App ID button.  4.  You should now see a Quick Start page similar to Figure 2-2. Ignore the code at  the top of the Quick Start page  it’s beyond what we want to accomplish . Scroll  down the page to find the textbox that says, “Where Is Your App Hosted?”. You  may see a textbox  not required  that requests you to enter a unique URL for your  app. If you do not enter one, Facebook will generate one. For our demo, we will  leave it blank.           42   Chapter 2   InterfaCes, platforms, ContaIners, and three-tIer programmIng  Figure 2-2.  The Facebook Quick Start page  Another textbox requires you to enter a secure URL to link your app into  Facebook. This is the actual location of your application on the Internet. Enter  the complete address of the secure web page you have discovered or enter the  location of your “Hello World” program if it is hosted on a secure site  https .  Note: Facebook requires  at least  an ending slash for your link, something  similar to:  www.mysita.com projects myfirstprogram.php   Click the Next button.     5.  The next page displayed will show more example code. This code can be used   to log in to your application using the Facebook login and has the ability to  request Facebook permissions for your application. However, our demo does not  need login ability or any Facebook permissions. Just click the Next button at the  bottom of the page.  43   Chapter 2   InterfaCes, platforms, ContaIners, and three-tIer programmIng  Figure 2-3.  The Facebook Open App page     6.  Click the Open Your App button. Once you click the button, Facebook will try to   load your page in the Canvas.  However, if you have picked an existing secure web page and see a message  similar to Figure 2-4, the page you selected might not allow hosting in another  site. If this happens, go to Steps 7-10. If you were successful, skip to Step 11.  However, copy and paste the URL  from the browser  that Facebook uses to  display your page, so you can test it again, if needed.  44   Chapter 2   InterfaCes, platforms, ContaIners, and three-tIer programmIng  Figure 2-4.  Facebook open app failure     7.   If your page did not display, do the following. After you have copied the URL,  close the test page. You now want to find the “Dashboard” for your app. If it is  not visible on your Developers Facebook page, go to the menu at the top of the  page and select Apps. A drop-down list should display showing the name of your  app s . Select your app.  45   Chapter 2   InterfaCes, platforms, ContaIners, and three-tIer programmIng  Figure 2-5.  The Facebook dashboard     8.  Once you have displayed your dashboard, select Settings on the left menu.  Figure 2-6.  The Facebook Settings page  46               Chapter 2   InterfaCes, platforms, ContaIners, and three-tIer programmIng  9.   Scroll down to the bottom of the page. Locate Secured Canvas URL and erase the  address that resides in this textbox. Type the location of another secured web  page  https  in the box.  Remember, this must be a URL on the web, not your localhost. Click the Save  Changes button.  10.  Now paste the URL of your app  if you lost the URL address, it is under Canvas   Page on the Settings Page  in your browser.  Figure 2-7.  Facebook working app  11.  You should now see your app display on the canvas within your Facebook page.  12.  Were you successful? What problems did you encounter following this example?   How did you solve those problems?  Congratulations, you have created your first Facebook app  although it is not live . If you would like   some of your friends to see your app, you can go back to the dashboard and select Rolls from the menu. You  can then use your friends  yes, they have to be Facebook Friends  and give them a “role” in the development  of your app  such as “Developers” or “Testers” . They then will have access to your app without it going live. You are on your way to making lots of money as a Facebook game developer! Well, maybe not just yet.   We left out a lot of coding to react with Facebook’s API. But hopefully you get the idea that Facebook can  easily be used as a container for your PHP applications.  PHP, AJAX, and CSS—Web Applications PHP and AJAX  Asynchronous JavaScript and XML  work well together. AJAX provides the ability to  dynamically change portions of a web page without reloading the complete page. Most web pages have  static areas  menus, headers, and footers  that do not change relative to user interaction. It is not necessary  for these areas of the web page to change when the user interacts  clicks a button  with the page. AJAX can  enable you to develop a container  in the following example, the container is located between the div tags   to display output from a program hosted on a web server; without disturbing the complete web page. Users  can then view content on a web page  menu, header, and footer  when the results of the user’s interaction   clicking a button  is still being processed. If for some reason the program is slow, hung, or missing, the  rest of the page still functions. You may have experienced this when you have displayed a page that hangs  because a lot of information  a lot of ads  is trying to load at once and the page will not function because it  must be completely loaded before it is usable.  AJAX also allows you to change the content of your PHP application on the web server without   disturbing the web page. You can then update the code in your application without the user’s knowledge    as long as you keep the name of the application the same .  Let’s look at an example.  47   Chapter 2   InterfaCes, platforms, ContaIners, and three-tIer programmIng     Note  Code example files are included on the book’s web site. You can copy and use these example without  any changes. every attempt has been made to ensure that code shown in this book is correct. printing errors  might affect the code shown  such as uppercase and lowercase being adjusted and parentheses being replaced  with angled parentheses . all code available on the web site is functional.  Example 2-1.  AJAX_Example_JavaScript.js  function getXMLHttp   {   var xmlHttp;   try   {     xmlHttp = new XMLHttpRequest  ;   }   catch e    {       Internet Explorer is different than the others     try     {       xmlHttp = new ActiveXObject "Msxml2.XMLHTTP" ;     }     catch e      {       try       {         xmlHttp = new ActiveXObject "Microsoft.XMLHTTP" ;       }       catch e        {         alert "Old browser? Upgrade today so you can use AJAX!"          return false;       }     }   }   return xmlHttp; } function AjaxRequest   {   var xmlHttp = getXMLHttp  ;   xmlHttp.onreadystatechange = function     {     if xmlHttp.readyState == 4      {       HandleResponse xmlHttp.responseText ;     }   }   xmlHttp.open "GET", "myfirstprogram.php", true ;    48   Chapter 2   InterfaCes, platforms, ContaIners, and three-tIer programmIng  xmlHttp.send null ; } function HandleResponse response  {   document.getElementById 'AjaxResponse' .innerHTML = response; }  JavaScript—A scripting language that provides the ability for a web page to be interactive.  With JavaScript, a web page can react to the user entering information into a textbox and  or clicking a button. If you need to brush up on JavaScript or need additional examples,  review the free “The New Boston”  thenewboston.com  videos at:  https:  www.youtube.com watch?v=yQaAGmHNn9s&list=PL46F0A159EC02DF82  For a more in-depth review of AJAX, review the free “The New Boston”  thenewboston.com   videos at:   https:  www.youtube.com playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGDiJSXfsJTASx9eMq_HlenQ.  If you don’t know JavaScript, don’t get too hung up on the details of this program. Let’s just look at  a few key points. AJAX uses HTTP GET to request a program, similar to a browser requesting a page. In  this example, an instance of the class XMLHttpRequest  which exists in the JavaScript libraries  is named  XmlHttp. This object is then used to open the request for the myfirstprogram.php  like opening a pipe .  Then the send method of the object sends the request  pushes the water down the pipe . If the file is  returned back properly, the output of the file is placed on the HTML web page between div tags with an ID  of AjaxResponse. If the browser can’t handle AJAX communication, an alert box will display suggesting the  user upgrade the browser. Although it is unlikely that anyone is using a browser that cannot interpret AJAX  code, you still should handle all possibilities.  Example 2-2.  ajaxdemo.html     PHP Ajax Demo                   PHP Ajax Demo           "Watch it!!"        The words below will be replaced by "Hello World" which is pulled from the   'myfirstprogram.php' file via AJAX.    AJAX DEMO                      Pay attention… Notice when you click the button that only this section changes.                Copyright &copy; 2015 Little Ocean Waves – Steve Prettyman               49   Chapter 2   InterfaCes, platforms, ContaIners, and three-tIer programmIng  For you to use this script, change the xmlHttp.open statement to select the file you wish to execute    instead of myfirstprogram.php . Change the document.getElementById line to include the ID of the div tag   you want to use to host the output  instead of AjaxResponse  in your HTML file  see the HTML code in the  next example .  HTML—Hypertext markup language is a markup language used to format the layout of  a web page. HTML is interpreted by a browser, which then displays the results to the user.  For a more in-depth review of HTML, visit the free “The New Boston”  thenewboston.com   videos at:   https:  www.youtube.com playlist?list=PL081AC329706B2953.  If you don’t know a lot about HTML, don’t worry. You only need to look at a few lines in this example.   First, near the top of the code, a link tag pulls in the ajaxdemo.css file. This CSS file allows you to see a page  with some graphic details. It allows you to demo that the page updates without the graphics from the CSS file  repasting or blinking. Right below this line the script type tag loads in the JavaScript file from Example 2-1.   If you named your file something else, this is the line you need to adjust with the new file name. If your files  are not all in the same folder, you should include the folder name along with the file name.  In the middle of the HTML body section, the input type tag creates a button that will call the   AjaxRequest function  contained in the JavaScript file  when clicked. This causes all the JavaScript code  in Example 2-1 to execute. The last line we need to pay attention to is the   tag.  The value in id  AjaxResponse  must match the object name used in the JavaScript getElementById code  exactly. Assuming that they match correctly, once the button is clicked, the JavaScript code will request the  myfirstprogram.php file and display the results between the div tags with the AjaxResponse ID.  Example 2-3.  ajaxdemo.css  body { background-color: 000000;                     font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; } wrapper { margin: 0 auto;                       width: 85%;                       min-width: 800px;                       background-color: cc0000;                       color: 000066; } header { background-color: ff0000;                      color: 00005D; }  h1 { margin-bottom: 10px; } content { background-color: ffffff;                    color: 000000;                    padding: 10px 20px;                    overflow: auto; } footer { font-size: 80%;                   text-align: center;                   padding: 5px;   background-color: 0000FF;                   color: ffffff;                   clear: both;} h2 { color: 000000;                 font-family: Arial, sans-serif; } floatright { float: right;                 margin: 10px; }  50   Chapter 2   InterfaCes, platforms, ContaIners, and three-tIer programmIng  Just to be complete, the CSS file is shown here. Don’t worry if you don’t know CSS. This file only makes  the web site look nice for the demo. If you are going to use this file, make sure to save it in a file with the .css  file extension. Also, if you are going to change the name of the file, make sure to also change the file name in  the link tag  in the HTML file  to exactly match. Make sure to include any folder names, if necessary.  CSS—Cascading Style Sheets  CSS  work with HTML to display graphics on a web page.  CSS  describes  the  layout  of  the  page,  colors,  text  fonts,  background  images,  and  other  characteristics of the web page. For a more in-depth review of CSS, visit the free “The New  Boston”  thenewboston.com  videos at:   https:  www.thenewboston.com videos.php?cat=40&video=18754.  Double-check all three files  .js, .css, and .html  to make sure the names of the files match  exactly   the links that call them. If all the files are properly linked, the ajaxdemo.html file will first display, as shown  in Figure 2-8.  Figure 2-8.  ajaxdemo.html  If your code does not work, double-check the file names  make sure they do not have a .txt ending .    If you see a blank page, there is something wrong. Look for typos in your code. Did you forget ;, {,  , or other  coding? If you get an error message, paste it in your browser to discover possible solutions. If you do not see  an error message, go to the logs  see Chapter 1  for Apache and PHP to determine other possible problems.  51   Chapter 2   InterfaCes, platforms, ContaIners, and three-tIer programmIng  Figure 2-9.  The ajaxdemo.html file after the AJAX request  If there are no syntax errors  or incorrect file names or locations , when the user clicks the button,    the page will request the myfirstprogram.php file using AJAX and will display the result of the execution of  the program between the div tags. In this example, Hello World will be displayed.  1.  Copy the three files shown previously from the book’s web site into your projects   folder  the location that you are running your projects in Apache . Run the  HTML program. Was your test successful? If not, why not?  2.  Change the file name of your .js file and change the link tag in your HTML file to   reflect the new file name. Test your HTML program. Was your test successful? If  not, why not?  3.  Change the name of your PHP program. Make changes to the .js file to reflect   the new name of your PHP program. Test your HTML program. Was your testing  successful? If not, why not?  PHP, AJAX, and CSS—Smart Phone Web Applications At this point, you should be beginning to discover the flexibility and power of creating PHP applications.  You might be a little disappointed that we did not cover app development for smart phones in any detail. As  mentioned, apps on smart phones usually do API calls to the operating system to request the use of applications  residing on the phone  such as GPS . That level of coding is beyond entry-level. Thus, beyond what is covered  in this book. However, there are times when we want to provide smart phones with the ability to access a web  application from the browser on the phone. We can provide this ability with just a few changes to the previous  demo. This provides you with an application that works with any size device that includes a browser.  Do It          52   Chapter 2   InterfaCes, platforms, ContaIners, and three-tIer programmIng  You will make this change without adjusting the HTML  except for adding a link , JavaScript, or PHP  code. You can adjust the ajaxdemo web page to format properly in smart phones or other mobile devices  using CSS. In this example, you only need to change the HTML file to discover the size of the display   interface . Then CSS can be used to change the graphics to fit the proper screen size.  If the PHP file includes a lot of HTML  and or other CSS code , we might need to also adjust the PHP file.   However, we should always consider having CSS format the overall output  instead of the PHP file . This will  allow you to use the same code in multiple containers  hosts  as you have seen demonstrated in this chapter.  You can add the following lines just below the link to the original CSS file in the ajaxdemo.html file.  <link href="ajaxdemomobile.css" rel="stylesheet" media="only screen and    max-device-width:480px ">       Note  the new complete html file is located on the book’s web site.  These two lines will attempt to determine the size of the display screen and use the new CSS file for any  screens that are 480px or less. The demo program, as is, will fit on most mobile devices. However, let’s adjust  it to remove some of the spacing, padding, and margins.     Note  You can also use the Css3 flexbox attribute for multiple device sizes. since its use requires a little  more understanding of Css, we will stick with the “old style” method. You can find more information on Css3  flexbox at the following w3schools link.  http:  www.w3schools.com css css3_flexbox.asp  Example 2-4.  The ajaxdemomobile.css file  body { background-color: 000000;             font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;       margin: 0;       } wrapper { margin: 0 auto;                       width: 100%;                       margin: 0;                       min-width: 0px;                       background-color: cc0000;                       color: 000066; } header { background-color: ff0000;                      color: 00005D;                      font-size: 100%;                      padding: 0.5px 0.5px 0.5px 0.5px; } h1 { margin: 0px; } content { background-color: ffffff;                       color: 000000;                       padding: 0.5px 0.5px;                       overflow: auto; } footer { font-size: 80%;                       text-align: left;                       padding: 0px;                       background-color: 0000FF;                       color: ffffff;                       clear: both;}  53   Chapter 2   InterfaCes, platforms, ContaIners, and three-tIer programmIng  h2 { color: 000000;             font-family: Arial, sans-serif;              margin: 0px;          } floatright { float: none;                         margin: 0px; }  Compare Example 2-4 to Example 2-3. The code in Example 2-4 is not perfect, but it does give you an   idea of what can be adjusted in the original CSS file for display in mobile devices. This example reduces  margins and padding to zero, or almost zero. This greatly reduces the wasted space on the display of a  smaller mobile device.  Do It    1.  Locate the new HTML file and CSS file on the book’s web site. If you have a web  host provider, upload these files  and the .js file  to the host. Try to access the  HTML page from your smart phone. You can also try to display the page by using  the URL location of the file on the book’s web site. Was your test successful? If  not, why not? Did the page format properly on your phone? If not, what do you  think needs to be adjusted?     Note  If you don’t have a host web site on the Internet, you can also test this Css file by downloading one of  the free mobile emulators available on the web  try www.download.com . You can also change the link tag in the  html file to point to the ajaxdemomobile.css file instead of the ajaxdemo.css file. then try reducing the size  of your browser to simulate a smart phone screen.  PHP, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Dynamic Web Pages As a last example of containers  hosts  for PHP programs, let’s consider the browser. As you have seen  in this chapter, you can use an HTML file to call our PHP program  clicking the button in the previous  demonstration . This, as detailed in Chapter 1, will cause the PHP program to execute and the results to be  returned to the browser. You could also have your PHP program return HTML code.  Example 2-5.  Dynamic HTML page created by a PHP program  <?php print " "; print "  My Program  "; print " "; print " Hello World "; print " "; print " "; ?>  You could return a complete HTML page  even with JavaScript and links  back to the device  browser    that requested the PHP program to execute. Example 2-5 would create a complete dynamic HTML page  from within PHP code. The output created can even contain links to CSS files and embedded CSS tags for  formatting. However, I urge caution on embedding CSS tags that depend on the container being a certain size.  As the developer, you do not know what type of device will display the result  PC, smart phone, tablet, or pad .  It would be better to provide multiple CSS files  as shown previously  to format the output for different devices.  54   Chapter 2   InterfaCes, platforms, ContaIners, and three-tIer programmIng  In the previous examples, we have separated the initial interface  HTML and JavaScript  from the PHP  program. You could actually place the HTML  to display the initial web page  and PHP code in the same file.  You can create a PHP file that will determine whether the user has ever requested the page before. If  they have not, or the browser has timed them out, then the PHP program could display an initial HTML  page for the user to interact  such as clicking a button . The same program could then call itself again to  determine if the button has been clicked and return a response.  Let’s look at a different version of the Hello World program to do just that.  Example 2-6.  The callmyself.php file  <?php if  isset $_POST['submitbutton']   { print "  Hello World  "; } else { print "   PHP Example  "; print " "; print "<input type='submit' id='submitbutton' name='submitbutton' value='Find Hello  World!' >"; print " "; print "  "; } ?>  For a more in-depth demonstration of PHP If statements, visit the following free videos  from “The New Boston”  thenewboston  at:   https:  www.thenewboston.com videos.php?cat=11&video=17004.  This program includes a simple if conditional statement to determine if the user has clicked the    submit button.  The format of the if statement is as follows:  if  conditional statement  {    code to execute if the conditional statement is true } else {    code to execute if the conditional statement is false }  A conditional statement usually compares two values to determine if they are the same or different or   calls a method which returns a true or false value. We will look at functions returning values in a moment.  Let’s look at a quick example of the first type.  Conditional statements use a comparison operator  ==,  ,  =  to determine if the   statement is true or false.  55   Chapter 2   InterfaCes, platforms, ContaIners, and three-tIer programmIng  If   a > b  { print "it's A!"; } else { print "it's B!"; }  In this example, the values in properties a and b are compared. If a is greater than b, then “it’s A!” is   displayed. Otherwise, “it’s B!” is displayed. PHP does some type conversion when it determines that it might  be necessary. For example, assume a = "5", and b = 6. PHP would convert the value in a from a string 5  to a number 5 so it can do the comparison. Many languages do not do this and will display an error if you  try to compare strings and numbers. If you don’t want this conversion to occur, you can use some special  comparison operators. For example, you can use three = signs to see if values are exactly the same  a === b   instead of two.  Security and performance—Whenever possible use === instead of ==. This will assure that  you get exactly what you expect.  In Example 2-6, the if statement calls a method  isset . $_GET tries to retrieve the property    'submitbutton'  and its value  “Find Hello World!”  from the HTML form, which used HTTP GET to pass  the information  you could have used $_POST and HTTP POST . isset will return a false or true back to the  if statement, depending on whether or not $_GET could retrieve the property  and its contents . The true or  false will cause the if statement to determine which block of code to execute.  As mentioned in Chapter 1, an object  such as a button  within an HTML form will produce a property  and value combination based on the object’s name and whatever is contained in the value statement of that  object. This is even true for submit buttons that have been given a name  id  and value  as in Example 2-6 .  The first time the program is called from the browser, the button has not been clicked. So there is no   submitbutton variable created. A false is returned by the isset method. The code jumps to the else section  and executes the print statements that display the HTML form and submit button  as in Figure 2-10 .  Figure 2-10.  callmyself.php before the button is clicked  When the user clicks the button, the program calls itself  look at the action parameter of the form tag .  This time, since the user has clicked the button, there is a submitbutton property and a value  'Find Hello  World!'  for that variable. The program determines that the variable is “set”  has a value in it  and returns  a true. The if statement then executes the one line of code between the if and else statements. Hello  World is then displayed. The PHP program handled all the functionality of the application without using any  existing static HTML page.  56   Chapter 2   InterfaCes, platforms, ContaIners, and three-tIer programmIng  Figure 2-11.  callmyself.php after the button is clicked  The advantage of this technique is that all code can be contained in one file. Thus, all changes occur   in one place. The disadvantage of this technique is that all code is in one file. The more complicate the  code, the “messier” it can become. One way to clean up the code would be to move the code into functions  contained within other PHP libraries  we will look at this later . The additional disadvantage is that the file  name cannot be changed without affecting the users. If you changed the file name to mynewprogram.php,   you would need to inform all your users of the new name  and maybe location . The previous examples  using AJAX allowed you to change the file name within the HTML code page, but did not require you to  change the actual name of the HTML page that the user would request.  Do It    1.  Find the callmyself.php file on the book’s web site. Download the file to your   Apache projects folder. Change and add print statements to display your  complete name, the term, and your major. Test your program. Did your program  run successfully? If not, why not?  PHP Three-Tier Architecture  Most of this chapter has been discovering the different platforms  or containers  that can “host” PHP applications.  We have found that PHP can display its output in almost any container  PC, Facebook, smart phone mobile  device, or browser . The ease at which PHP can interact with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS has provided this   flexibility. Today, almost any platform has the ability to interact with the Internet  and those that don’t will  sometime in the future . Any platform that can interact with the Internet can also interact with a PHP application.  This independence  or flexibility  of the interface demonstrates a logical separation of the platform or   host of the interface from other “tiers”  parts  of the application. This leads into a discussion of the three- tier architecture and the logical design of PHP applications. The larger the application, the more likely the  application will need to be broken into modules. Also, it’s more likely that these modules could reside on  different servers  or web servers . Larger applications likely will require multiple programmers writing code  at the same time. These programmers may even use different languages to create the program modules.  Building a large application is not much different than assembling a car. The individual components of  the car  body, wheels, electronics, and engine  are assembled individually first. Each completed component  is then placed inside the chassis of the car. The components are then connected  hoses, wires, and belts  to  other components. When completed, all components of the car work together. If a component breaks, it can  be replaced without causing replacement or changes to any other component in the car.  The idea of modular  or component  programming is based on the methodology of blocks of code  that can be created individually to be assembled with other modules to produce a working application.  The modules can be modified or replaced without requiring changes to other modules. This methodology  has been around for a while. Even today, many programs are not modular because smaller programs can  work efficiently without being broken into modules. However, as these applications expand into larger   57   Chapter 2   InterfaCes, platforms, ContaIners, and three-tIer programmIng  applications they become more difficult to update or maintain. A change requires updating the complete  application rather than just a module. At some point, an expanding application that has not be created with  modules has to be redesigned from the ground up into modules for better maintenance and reliability.  As discussed in Chapter 1, a search engine can display a web page interface in a browser on the user’s   PC. Once the user enters the search request, the information can be transmitted across the Internet to a  remote server  we don’t know where , which executes a search application  we don’t know what program  language was used to create it . The application then searches a database  we don’t know what DBMS or  where it is located  for the requested information. The results are sent back to the application, which in turn,  sends the information back to the browser  via the web server  on the user’s PC.  Figure 2-12.  Three-tier modular application design  The flow of information in this process causes the design of this type of web application to naturally  fall into  at least  three tiers  modules ; interface tier, business rules tier, and data tier. One advantage of  breaking code into different tiers is the ability to reuse tiers with multiple applications. For example, our  search engine could use the same business rules tier and data tier for multiple devices while using a different  interface  PC app or smart phone app . Distinct tiers can also be updated without affecting other tiers.  The smart phone app interface could be updated to use the latest features of the newest operating system  without changes to the business rules or data tiers. Code within the business rules tier could be updated  to fix logical bugs without requiring changes to the interface or data tiers. Let’s take a look at what typically  occurs in each tier.  Modular  Three-Tier  Applications,  Design,  Programming—Three-tier  design  provides  the ability to create programs that can be separated into an interface tier, business rules  tier, and data tier. The interface tier contains all graphics and program code related to  displaying information to the user. The business rules tier does not contain an interface.  However,  it  processes  any  information  submitted  from  the  interface  tier  and  can  then  submit  information  to  the  data  tier  to  be  stored.  The  data  tier  is  the  primary  storage  location for the application, which may include the use of a database. Each tier can be  independently changed and built  compiled  without affecting the other tiers.  1.  What are the name of the three tiers of modular design?  2.  How is modular design similar to designing a building?  3.  How does modular programming make coding more efficient?  Do It          58   Chapter 2   InterfaCes, platforms, ContaIners, and three-tIer programmIng  Interface Tier  Figure 2-13.  Interface tier  The interface tier  IT  displays information and provides the user the ability to interact with the   application. Most interfaces provide a Graphical User Interface  GUI , which allows the user an attractive  way to view information and interaction with the application. GUI interfaces provide common objects,  including textboxes and buttons, which help the user to quickly adapt to new applications. In addition,  pictures, images, icons, video, and sound can often be included to keep the user’s interest. Menus and other  navigation objects are also commonly included to help the user move through the application successfully.  Objects—Objects are blocks of code that have already been compiled for use within an  application. Objects can be placed into a program by making an instance of the object.  Objects contain methods and properties. Methods  or functions  are blocks of code that  accomplish  a  task   such  as  placing  items  in  a  list  box .  Properties   or  variables   are  characteristics of an object that can be changed  such as a background color . Objects are  usually well tested and error free. By reusing existing objects, the programmer can quickly  create more reliable programs.  This tier will display information using objects  such as labels and picture boxes  or scripting code   such as the ajaxdemo.html example in this chapter . The tier will also accept information from the user  through interactive objects  such as textboxes and buttons . Static information can be provided from within  the tier  via menus, logos, or footers . Dynamic information is usually provided to the tier from the business  rules tier  such as the output from myfirstprogram.php shown in this chapter .  Some coding  shown in later chapters , which prepares information to be send to other tiers may   be present in the interface tier. For example, JavaScript code that verifies that the user has entered all the  required information or the proper information  numeric characters in an age textbox  is acceptable.  Additional code may also prepare information received from the business rules tier to be displayed  such as  converting numbers to text format  in the interface.  Verification Verification  Code—Verification  code  validates  information.  The  code  compares the information received to an expected standard format. For example, the code  can verify that an e-mail address has both a @ and a .  period . If the information has  both symbols, it could be considered “valid”  although we still are not sure that the e-mail  address actually exists . If it does not have both symbols, the code is not valid. Information  that is not valid usually will cause the program to display an error message to the user  requesting valid information be reentered.  59   Chapter 2   InterfaCes, platforms, ContaIners, and three-tIer programmIng  The interface must provide code with the ability to react to user interactions  clicking the Submit   button , commonly called user events. Code may also be provided that prepares information provided by the  user for use by other tiers  such as converting text entered by the user into number format for a calculation  in the business rules tier .  Event—Event-driven languages  such as PHP  can execute blocks of code when an event  occurs. Events can be something that the user has done  such as clicking a button . Events  can also be fired by the operating system. Programs provide listener code that “hears” an  event. When an event occurs, the code provides an event method, which then executes.   A program chooses which events to listen for by the presence, or lack of, listener code.  The interface tier should not directly interact with a database management system or a database itself.   By doing so, this would lock the tier into the database location and actual design of the database. The tier  should not manipulate data  except for display purposes . Any accounting, mathematical calculations, or  processing of data related to the application itself should be accomplished in the business rules tier.  Database  Management  System   DBMS —A  Database  Management  System  is  software  that allows a user or an application to create and define a database. It also provides the  ability to insert, update, or delete information in the database.  Do  Don’t  Format data for display Verify correct information from user Respond to user events Handle the unexpected  exceptions   Format data for business rules tier  Access data from database Calculate results Process information Verify user IDs and passwords  1.  Give three examples of items that would be included in the interface tier.  2.  Give three examples of items that would not be included in the interface tier.  3.  Can some program code exist in the interface tier? If so, what tasks does this    code provide?  Do It          60   Chapter 2   InterfaCes, platforms, ContaIners, and three-tIer programmIng  Business Rules Tier  Figure 2-14.  Business rules tier  The business rules tier processes all information and data received from the interface tier and the data  tier. This tier will also return information requested by the interface tier  such as returning "Hello World"   and submit information to the data tier for storage. Most of the actual programming code is contained in   this tier.  The business rule tier code usually makes an application truly unique from another application. If an  application is copyrighted, the uniquely creative algorithms are probably hidden in this tier. For example,  many of the differences in web search engines and how the information will ultimately be displayed are  embedded in the business rules tier.  Unlike the interface tier, which may contain code in the browser, all coding in the business tier is   completed using a program s   such as PHP  on a server. Scripting and programming code residing on a  server is secured by the server itself and cannot be accessed by the user. Business tier code can also reside on  an application server  as a service  or on a web server  as a web service . Servers ensure that code in this tier  is secure by not allowing direct access by the user.  Server Application  Server Web  Server—A  server  is  connect  to  a  network  to  provide  services  to  any  node   machine   on  the  network   or  the  Internet .  A  server  can  provide  more than one service  communication, security, and or storage  or can provide a specific  service. Application servers house applications that are accessible to users on the network   or Internet . Web servers host web pages and web applications. They are usually exposed  to access outside a corporation.  Service—Services  are  applications  that  reside  in  the  memory  of  a  computer  or  server  that respond to requests from other applications. Services can be automatically loaded  into memory when the computer or server is booted or they can manually be started and  stopped when required. Services do not have GUI interfaces. The business rules tier can  reside as a service s  on a computer or server.  If information passed between the tiers of the application can be subject to possible manipulation by   hackers, this tier may contain code, similar to the interface tier, to verify the validly and proper format of the  data received.  61   Chapter 2   InterfaCes, platforms, ContaIners, and three-tIer programmIng  Information passed from this tier to other tiers can be format for easy acceptance. For example, a   dataset  similar to a table or spreadsheet  can be returned to the interface tier for display in a table or list box  existing on a web page. A dataset could also be sent to the data tier to be inserted into a database.  Dataset—A dataset is a structure that can hold multiple data tables. A data table is similar  to a table in a database  with rows, columns, and data  or a spreadsheet. Datasets are  commonly used to pass information between tiers and between methods.  The business rules tier returns values to the tiers that request it. The tier does not provide any GUI  interfaces or forms of any kind. Interfaces are not needed because the tier has no direct contact with the  user at any time. All communication to the business rules tier is handled either through the interface tier  or the data tier. Like the interface tier, the business rules tier does not directly update stored information in  databases. All storage updates occur in the data tier.  Do  Don’t  Manipulate data Format data Store data in memory Raise exceptions  Verify data  Display information Save data on secondary device Display error messages  Do It          1.  What tasks can business rule tier code accomplish that is similar to a task   accomplished by code in the interface tier? Why is this code possibility  duplicated in both tiers?  2.  How does the business rules tier pass and receive data  information ?  3.  Why must the business rules tier talk indirectly through the interface tier to   provide information to the users?  62   Chapter 2   InterfaCes, platforms, ContaIners, and three-tIer programmIng  Data Tier  Figure 2-15.  Data tier  The data tier’s main function is to store information on a secondary device or to return data to the   business rules tier. Data can  and usually is  be stored in a database using a Database Management System   like MySQL . The tier interfaces with the business rules tier, since data may be manipulated before being  displayed, as in the creation of a report. Data is returned from the tier in a format that the business rules tier   and program languages  can accept. Common formats include JSON, XML, SOAP, and datasets.  JSON—JavaScript  Object  Notation  is  a  format,  similar  to  XML,  to  store  and  exchange  data. JSON can be viewed within an editor or browser. It is most commonly used to pass  data between tiers.  XML—Extensible Markup Language is a markup language, similar to HTML, to store and  describe data. XML can also be used to transmit data between tiers. We will provide an  example of XML in Chapter 3.  SOAP—Simple Object Access Protocol is used to exchange data with a web service. It works  with HTTP  Hypertext Transfer Protocol  and SMTP  Simple Mail Transfer Protocol  to  provide communication between an application and a web service.  Web  Service—An  application,  without  an  interface,  that  can  be  called  to  process  information. A web service can provide the functionality of the business tier and or data  tier remotely on a web server. The Web Services Description Language  WSDL  is used to  describe calls to the web service and the format of information accept and returned by the  web service. WSDL is similar to XML.  Validation with the data tier is done in the Database Management System and or via program code.   Validation in this tier is the last chance to make sure data is reliable and accurate before the database is  updated. It is much easier to catch validation problems before they are stored than after invalid information  has been recorded.  Data storage can be local and or remote. Mobile devices can restrict storage to local databases    smart phones , but can also use WSDL  web services  to store and retrieve information remotely on a  server or within a cloud  such as Microsoft Azure . Additionally, many applications save small amounts of  information locally with cookies, or larger amounts of information in remote databases.  Microsoft  Azure—Microsoft  Azure  is  a  cloud  platform  that  provides  data  services,  app  services, and network services. Visual Studio Applications can be uploaded and secured in  the Microsoft Azure cloud.  63   Chapter 2   InterfaCes, platforms, ContaIners, and three-tIer programmIng  The data tier uses SQL statements  INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, and SELECT  to retrieve and update   information in a database. However, the actual request for the information to be changed comes from within  the business rules tier. For example, a user requesting an address change in a web application would have  to enter the requested change in the interface tier, format the update request in the business rules tier, and  change the information in the database in the data tier.  Do  Don’t  Save data on secondary device Update data on secondary device Raise exceptions  Manipulate data Display error messages Display information  Verify data  Do It          1.  Why must the data tier validate information again, before it is placed in a   database?  2.  What type of code, if any, can exist in the data tier?  3.  What is SQL used for?  Putting It All Together The Program Development Life Cycle  PDLC  leads us through the overall design and creation process  for application development. The key to application development success is to properly plan the layout of  your system before beginning the coding and development. By doing so, you reduce the amount of errors  and problems that can occur. Many projects can run into a “corner” that the developer cannot get around  because of poor planning up front. Different authors and instructors will vary on their estimates on the time  to spend in the planning process because it is based on the individual. A more skilled, or more experienced  individual may do less planning than someone who is not as confident. However, everyone plans out, at  least, the required modules and the type of data flowing between the modules; even if it is done just on  scratch paper. The key, also, is to revise your plan as you work through the coding and development process.  As you start coding, you will discover “I did not think of that” scenarios. Go back, right then, and adjust your  plan. The more you do so, the less likely that you will hit a “corner” that you cannot find a way to get around.  Always involve the user in your PDLC process, along with as strong a team of experts. Remember you   are developing this project to make your customer happy. You may believe you have the ultimate design and  solution. However, that does not matter if your user does not agree with you. Sometimes you do have to adjust  your thinking to be more in line with the customer. Working in the industry I remember a major change- management system that was being created within my work group  I was so happy to not be involved in the  project . The designers and coders created a very fancy and expensive, system that, once it was implemented in  the data centers, was hardly used. Why? The data center personnel did not want a fancy system; they wanted a  simple system that could quickly complete the tasks needed. Even though the original project took six months  to complete, a data center employee spent a few weekends of his own time creating another system that  accomplished what they wanted. That system was implemented and used for many years afterward.  Commonly the PDLC is defined with five steps; Planning and Information Gathering, Analysis, Design,   Implementation, and Evaluation. In the planning and information gathering step, all requirements for the  project and the project team are assembled. Initial documents are also created answering the questions “What  are we trying to accomplish?”, “How are we going to accomplish it?”, and “What team are we going to use?” In   64   Chapter 2   InterfaCes, platforms, ContaIners, and three-tIer programmIng  the analysis step, a determination is made as to the feasibility of the project. Documents answer the questions  “Can we accomplish the project with the team and resources available?”, “What additional resources need to be  gathered?”, and “Can the project be accomplished in the timeframe and budget allocated?” If the project makes  it past the analysis step  many projects don’t , then the actual design begins. In the design phase, a top-down  approach begins by first looking at the overall required modules, and the data flow between the modules. More  details are gradually added as the methods required are determined, a platform is decided on, communication  tools come together, and information storage is designed.  After a detailed design has been created, and approved, the project goes into development and testing.  Both unit testing  individual modules  and complete application testing will occur. After successful testing,  the project is ready for the Implementation Step. During implementation decisions have to be made on how  to install the project and when to install it. After implementation, the application is “live”. But still continuous  evaluation should occur to determine efficiently needs, security problems, logical problems, and possible  overall enhancements to the project. Eventually, most projects will then revert back to the first step of the  process for the development of a new version.  This section assumes that the planning and information gathering and analysis steps have been   completed successfully, which would move you into the design step. We will look, in general, at the process of  determining what type of activities should occur in which tiers of an application. We will also look at the type of  data or information that may flow between the tiers. In later chapters we will refine this analysis by determining  the types of methods that would be required and the information and data that must flow into and out of these  methods. We will also look at the actual activities and code that would be created for these methods.  The best way to learn is by doing, so let’s look at a case problem and go from there.  Case Study Company: Atomic Fish Hatchery, Inc.  Project: Field Sales Ordering and Commission Application Scope: This application will be accessible from multiple devices  mobile and PC  to allow field sales   agents, managers, and payroll personnel easy access to necessary information. The system will accept  information from the sales agent that will be used to determine purchase costs to the customer, sales  volume for the sales manager, and commissions for the payroll department. Phase one of the project is  the development of the application to accept information from the sales agents, display purchase cost,  determination of commissions, and storage of the information into a MySQL database. After successful  testing the platform, it will be moved and secured in the company’s cloud platform.  Inputs  from Sales Agent : Sales Agent Number, Customer Number, Order Number, Item Number,   Quantity, and Special Needs  Outputs:  Additional information may be determined for future phases  To database: In addition to the input from the sales agent: commission, sales total The goal is to determine the types of information and processes that will occur in each tier and the   data flow between the tiers. Once determined, this information could be used to develop a general empty  structure of tiers that would eventually hold the completed project.  Interface Tier The company has requested access from multiple devices. Thus, we must keep in mind that mobile devices   tablets and smart phones  will be used to input and output information in addition to laptops and PCs. We  may decide to create multiple interfaces for each type of device. With three-tier design, you could design a  system that shares the business rules tier and data tier contents while allowing this flexibility.  As a designer and or programmer, you must determine the type of information that will be entered;   several fields  Sales Agent Number, Customer Number, Order Number, Item Number, and Quantity  all  indicate that numbers will be entered. You need to determine the size of these fields and verify that only   65   Chapter 2   InterfaCes, platforms, ContaIners, and three-tIer programmIng  numeric information is entered. The Amount field is the only field that possibly could be used in a future  calculation. Therefore, all other fields can remain in text format. The Amount field would need to be  converted to integer format before passing the information to the business rules tier. The Special Needs field  would be a larger field that can accept alphanumeric characters. The database does not currently exist, so  you would determine field sizes from company policy and or current paper forms used. Once reviewed, it  has been determined that the customer and sales agent numbers are eight characters. The order number  and item numbers are currently six characters.  After gathering this information, you can now design the top view of the interface tier, as shown in   Figure 2-16.  Figure 2-16.  Atomic Fish Hatchery Inc. sales and order application interface  Fields with + may be used more than once to enter in all information by the sales agent. When the   actual datasets and data tables are created, multiple columns must be available for these entries.  An additional form  not pictured  would also exist to display the results of the order. This form would   display a summary of the items purchased and the total cost. All information could be entered by the sales agent,  submitted, and held in the interface tier  a cookie? , until the sales agent indicated that the order is complete.  Then the information could be transferred to the business rules tier for processing. The business rules tier could  then return the information to be displayed in the second form. The second form could include an “approved”   or cancel  button. Once “approved,” the information could then be passed to the data tier for storage.  66   Chapter 2   InterfaCes, platforms, ContaIners, and three-tIer programmIng  Business Rules Tier The business rules tier would include two processes. One process would accept the complete order    dataset data table  and determine the total sales cost after the sales agent clicked a “competed order”  button. It would then return a summary of this information to the second form. The other process would  execute when the agent clicks an “approved” button. The process would then determine the commission  and create a dataset  there are now additional fields  to be passed to the data tier. The information would  then be passed for storage.  Additionally, to make sure order data is valid, methods would be needed to validate the fields received   from the interface. The top view of the Business Rules Tier would the following shown in Figure 2-17.  Figure 2-17.  Atomic sales and order application business rules tier  Data Tier In this case, the data tier is only used to store the information provided by the business rules tier. The tier  would verify the information received and store it into the database, as shown in Figure 2-18.  67   Chapter 2   InterfaCes, platforms, ContaIners, and three-tIer programmIng  Figure 2-18.  Atomic sales and order application data tier  There are many tools available to help in the design process. The important factor is that the designer  include all the important information in the process. As an alternative to the example, you could remove   the description of the datasets from the tiers and place them in the data flow between the tiers, as shown   in Figure 2-19.  Figure 2-19.  Alternate three-tier model  68   Chapter 2   InterfaCes, platforms, ContaIners, and three-tIer programmIng  Figure 2-20.  Atomic Sales and Order Application Three-Tier Model  Do It          1.  When must you convert numbers to numeric form  such as Integer  for storage   within a database?  2.  Why use datasets to pass information between tiers?  3.  What items have been missed or ignored in the case example?  69   Chapter 2   InterfaCes, platforms, ContaIners, and three-tIer programmIng  MVC and Dependency Injection  MVC  Model-View-Controller  is a design pattern used by software engineers  including PHP application  designers  to communicate between the view and model using a controller. The controller is software that  transfers any user input to the model. MVC design can be considered circular because the model, controller,  and view have the ability to communicate with each other. The standard three-tier model is linear; for the  Interface to receive or pass information to the data tier, it must pass the information through the business  rules tier. There are many tools on the market  such as Ruby on Rails  that can assist software engineers in  designing MVC applications.  Visit thenewboston.com for a generic example of an MVC application:   https:  www.thenewboston.com videos.php?cat=88  MVC and Component Based Design can use Dependency Injection. Dependency Injection allows the  program  client  that will use a block of code  such as a class  while not know the actual implementation of  the block of code. This allows for independent development, updating, testing, and reusability of modules.  This is similar to the ability of the ignition of a car communicating with the starter. The ignition has little  knowledge of the starter component and how it operates. It does not even know the brand of starter.  The ignition merely knows to send a signal  electricity  to the starter to tell it to operate. If the starter is  replaced, the ignition is unaware and unaffected by the change, as long as the starter still operates when it  receives the signal.

Once code has been  installed in a library it can easily be reused in other programs. The reuse of code that has already been  well tested and used in “live” environments greatly reduces program errors and increases productivity  because you don’t have to reinvent the wheel. There is no need to recreate code that is already successfully  working. It’s a waste of time and energy and likely to cause unnecessary program errors. The programmer  actually may not know what actual code exists in a module of code  class . However, the programmer knows  what parameters  such as numbers  can be passed into the “black box” and what is returned  sum of the  numbers  from the black box.  It may concern you that the programmer blindly passes information into the black box and blindly   receives information back. However, this is an advantage, not a disadvantage. This allows the creator of the  module to update the code without affecting the way the module is used. As long as the module accepts  the same input and returns the same output, the programmer who is using the module notices no changes.  Updates can occur to the module for better efficiently, better security, or to correct any program code  problems without causing the users to change how they handle the module in their code.

Extensions in the php.ini file  extension=php_bz2.dll extension=php_curl.dll ;extension=php_fileinfo.dll extension=php_gd2.dll ;extension=php_gettext.dll ;extension=php_gmp.dll ;extension=php_intl.dll ;extension=php_imap.dll ;extension=php_interbase.dll ;extension=php_ldap.dll extension=php_mbstring.dll ;extension=php_exif.dll extension=php_mysql.dll extension=php_mysqli.dll ;extension=php_oci8.dll   For a complete list and explanation of PHP extensions, visit:   http:  php.net manual en extensions.alphabetical.php.  PHP has a large amount of libraries available with thousands of lines of well tested code. Example 3-1 is   a partial copy of the php.ini file showing several extensions  libraries  that are available to be activated in  PHP. Each of these libraries is C code with a PHP wrapper  for better communication with PHP programs .  The code is already compiled  notice the .dll extensions . A library that exists in the PHP environment  can be activated by removing the comment symbol  ;  in front of the extension statement in the php.ini  file. Once the INI file has been saved, PHP and Apache must be reloaded  see Chapter 1 for examples on  the location of the php.ini file and reloading PHP and Apache . This ease of adding libraries is one of the  reasons PHP has become so popular. Additional libraries can be “installed” into PHP using several methods.  One of the more popular methods, Pear  PHP Extension and Application Repository , handles code  distribution and maintenance of third-party libraries.  The use of Pear and other third-party library installation methods is beyond the scope of  this book. However, you can find additional information at the link below.  http:  pear.php.net manual en about.pear.php.  In addition, programmers can “install” their own libraries of code  that are not already compiled    directly into an application via the require or require_once statement. It is common practice in  corporations to include code that may be reused many times  such as accessing a database . By providing  this  well tested  code in a local library, any changes  such as the movement of the database to another  server  can be handled in one location  the local library file , instead of requiring multiple files to be  changed. This also reduces code redundancy and increases its reliability.  While local libraries can contain just methods  functions  of code, it is more common that modules    classes  exist in these libraries. This allows programmers to code with the “black box” concept previously  mentioned. The three-tier architecture  explained in Chapter 2  is based on this premise. The code classes  can be accessed from the library by referencing the library containing the code  via the require or require_ once statement . Once a reference is made, an instance of the class  object  is then created. Once an instance  has been created, the program code has access to all the functionality of the object.  78   Chapter 3   Modular prograMMing  Classes and Objects A class is similar to a blueprint of a house. The blueprint contains a description  characteristics  of all the  elements needed to construct the house. However, the blueprint is not the actual house itself. It describes  what is possible if we hire a crew and construct the house. The blueprint is not considered to exist  as a  house would exist . However, it describes the items needed to build the house  nails, drywall, and wood   and the process to build the house.  A class describes the characteristics  properties  of the module of code and the actions  methods  or functions  that can occur in that code. However, it does not physically exist  within memory  until  an instance of the class  called an object  is created. Once an instance is created, the characteristics  and methods can be accessed. Classes and objects  when created properly  protect the characteristics   properties  from direct access. This provides the object the opportunity to verify that any request to change  a value in a property is valid before the change occurs. This is commonly called encapsulation. To protect  properties from direct access to the outside world, they should be declared using the private access type.  Private access will only allow methods within the class the ability to change the values in the properties. Set  methods  discussed later in this chapter  are used to change properties. Get methods  also discussed later  in this chapter  are normally used to retrieve property values.  Creating a PHP Class  Let’s begin by creating a basic structure for a class. You will create a dog class which will allow you to set  some characters of the dog  size, breed, color, and name  and you will provide the ability for the dog to speak  and to display the values saved in each property. You will create the dog class in a separate file  library  that  can be loaded into the program  or any other program  when needed.  To create a PHP class, you use the class keyword and encapsulate all code within the class in {}.  Example 3-2.  Basic class structure in the dog.php file  <?php class Dog {    all code is placed here } ?>  As seen in Example 3-2, the class keyword is lowercase. However, the name of the class, Dog, begins   with an uppercase letter. PHP will allow you to create a class with a lowercase first letter. However, it is  common practice to easily identify classes by the use of the uppercase first letter. The actual file name  containing your class  dog.php  should also match the class name  Dog .  For more information on classes, methods, and properties visit php.net at:  http:  php.net manual en classobj.examples.php.   For videos, visit "the new boston" at:  https:  www.thenewboston.com videos.php?cat=11&video=17175.  Class names cannot include spaces. You should also avoid using special characters. However,    the _ is permitted and commonly used to connect two words together  set_name . You many notice that  some class names include two underscores  __  before the actual class name  __Myclass . However, this is  not a recommended technique due to the existence of “magical” classes  we will look at two of these classes  later in this chapter  that use this format.  79   Chapter 3   Modular prograMMing  As mentioned previously, a class contains properties. Properties are also called variables. Properties   include characteristics of the class. When an instance of a class is created, the properties are unique for  that object. The operating system reserves a space in memory to hold the properties. The operating system  handles memory management for us, including cleaning up properties that are no longer needed. In PHP,  anytime a closing bracket  }  is reached, properties that have been created are scheduled for removal by the  garbage collector of the operating system. The program can no longer access the property at that point.  Properties can hold many different types of data. In most languages, when a property is created you   must also include a data type to describe the kind of data being stored  such as string . However, PHP does  not require the defining of a data type. PHP determines the type of data to be stored in a property the first  time data is placed in the property. Properties are created with an initial $ and the name of the property.  Property names can include alphabetic characters, numbers, and the _. The _ can be used at the beginning  of the property  after the $  or between words. No spaces are allowed. Properties are commonly created  with lowercase letters. However, PHP does allow uppercase letters. PHP is case-sensitive and will consider a  lowercase property  speak  and an uppercase property  Speak  two different properties.  Example 3-3.  Basic class structure with properties in dog.php file  <?php class Dog { private $dog_size = 0; private $dog_breed = "no breed"; private $dog_color = "no color"; private $dog_name = "no name"; } ?>   Program design recommendation—Properties are created on the fly in PHP. Properties are  created the first time you use them. This can both be a help and a pain. If you misspell a  property name, PHP will not produce an error. Instead it will create a new property with  the misspelled name. It is recommended  when possible  that properties be created with  initial values at the top of your program  or method, or class  to more easily determine  what your property name is and whether it has been created.  As seen in Example 3-3, each of the properties  except $dog_size  for the Dog class has been declared   private and initially set with a string  text . The $dog_size property has been set to the number zero   we know it is a number and not a string because there are no "" around the zero . The operating system  will store the strings values in the properties  $dog_breed, $dog_color, and $dog_name  in ASCII format   combinations of zeros and ones to represent each character  and will store the value in the $dog_size  property in a numerical format in memory. The operating system creates memory tables to look up the  actual memory address of the value in a variable when it is used in a program.   the format of the code must also include a semicolon at the end of the code statements  all code      Note  lines that are executed must include semicolons .  As you may note, at this point the example is not very useful. Even if you were to create an instance  of the class, you could not access anything in the class or display the values in the properties. Let’s add a  method to the class to allow you to display what is contained in the class. To do so, you need to create a  method to display the values using the print statement. You can also take this opportunity to build one  single string of output using string concatenation.  80   Chapter 3   Modular prograMMing  String concatenation can be done in several ways in PHP. In many languages, building strings with   properties require continuously opening and closing a string  using "" .  print "Dog_weight is " . $this->dog_weight  . ". Dog breed is " . $this->dog_breed . "Dog  color is " . $this->dog_color;  The print code line above is valid in PHP. However, as you can see, you have a lot of quotes and many   periods. It can be difficult to get everything matched up correctly. The period is a string concatenation  character in PHP and would be required, if you choose to use this technique  you would have to use a similar  madness in many languages . However, PHP is much friendlier than this.  This pointer—The $this pointer is used to gain access to properties contained in an object.  this indicates that the code wants to retrieve the value contained in a property that exists  in the particular object  instance of the class . Soon we will be creating an instance of the  class named $lab. When the code that will exist in the $lab instance is executed, the $this  pointer will tell the operating system that it wants the value in the property  such as dog_ weight  that exists in the $lab instance only. Note that the format of the statement includes  a $ sign for the $this pointer but not for the variable  $this->dog_weight .  You might ask, why do we need the $this pointer? The simple answer is that you can create  a property that exists for every instance of the class  called a static property . If this type of  property changed, it would change for all the instances of the class. Our private properties  only change for the particular instance  $lab  of the class in which it was referenced.  print "Dog weight is $this->dog_weight. Dog breed is $this->dog_breed. Dog color is   $this->dog_color.";  PHP allows you to place properties within strings  quotes . This allows you to use fewer periods and   quotes  and maybe reduce pulling too many hairs from your head .  For examples of the $this pointer, visit:   http:  php.net manual en language.oop5.basic.php  For videos of the $this pointer, visit:   https:  www.thenewboston.com videos.php?cat=11&video=17177  Now that you have the code needed to produce an output, you need to add a method in the class to  execute the print line. All “actions” that take place in a class must be included in a method. Methods are  created in a similar style as classes  except they are actually contained within the classes . Methods are  declared using the keyword function followed by a method name and   . It is common practice for method  names to be lowercase, although PHP will accept uppercase characters. The _ can also be included at the  beginning or within the method name. All code with a method is contained within {}.  Example 3-4.  Basic class structure with properties and a method in dog.php file  <?php class Dog {         private $dog_weight = 0;         private $dog_breed = "no breed";         private $dog_color = "no color";         private $dog_name = "no name";  81       function display_properties       {          print "Dog weight is $this->dog_weight. Dog breed is $this->dog_breed. Dog color is   Chapter 3   Modular prograMMing  $this->dog_color.";      } } ?>   Program  design  recommendation—As  seen  in  Example  3-4,  it  becomes  much  more  important to be aware of the proper use of the opening and closing brackets  { and } . For  every open bracket, there must be a closing bracket. It can become difficult to determine if  you are missing something. Editors  discussed in Chapter 1  can help color code everything  to make it easier to see. Also, indenting  as seen in Example 3-4  can help visually line up  the brackets. The PHP engine ignores extra spacing  called whitespace . So the programmer  can make the code more visually pleasing and easier to debug.  This class now has the ability to perform an action  via the display_properties method . So you can  finally test its functionality. In order to do so, the code from Example 3-4 must be placed in the dog.php file   same as the class name  in the same location as the program that will use it.  We now need to create a program that will pull in this library  via the require_once statement . The   program will then need to make an instance of the class  Dog . Finally, the program will need to call the  method  display_properties  to display the contents of the properties.  Program  design  recommendation—PHP  will  allow  the  include,  include_once,  require,  and require_once statements to be used anywhere in your program code. This could cause  potential issues if it’s used in the incorrect location or used more than once. It is strongly  recommended that these statements be include together as close to the top of your code as  possible for easy review to determine if libraries have already been installed.  Security  and  reliability—PHP  has  several  methods  available  to  pull  libraries  into  PHP  programs. The  include method will attempt to pull in a library. However, if the library  does not exist, the program will continue to run  or crash . The include method also does  not  concern  itself  with  possibility  that  the  library  might  already  have  been  attached  to  the  code.  It  is  possible  that  a  large  program  might  accidentally  try  to  pull  in  the  same  library more than once  which would crash the program due to duplicate method and  or class names . The include_once method eliminates the possibility of attempting to pull  in a library more than once. If the library has already been included, the statement will  not execute. The require method does not allow the program to continue running if the  library cannot be found. However, like the include method, it could attempt to pull in the  same library more than once. The require_once method solves these potential problems by  shutting the program down if the library cannot be found and by only installing the library  if it has not already been installed.  The format of the require_once statement is simple. The keyword require_once is followed with the  library name  dog.php . The statement should be included near the top of your code and before you make  an actual instance of the class  Dog .  require_once "dog.php" ;  82   You can include path names within a require_once statement. However, it is recommended  that you do not include absolute paths. For more information visit:   http:  php.net manual en function.require-once.php   Chapter 3   Modular prograMMing  For Examples visit:   For videos visit:   https:  www.thenewboston.com videos.php?cat=11&video=17028   https:  www.thenewboston.com videos.php?cat=11&video=17029.  To create an instance of a class, a property is created that “points” to the instance of the class in   memory. The new keyword is included to inform the operating system that an instance of the class should be  created in memory  and the constructor method should execute, as mentioned later . The actual class name  is included to determine which class is to be built into an object.  $lab = new Dog;  This code would create an instance of the Dog class and refer to it with the $lab property  pointer .  Actual individual copies of each of the properties  $dog_size, $dog_breed, $dog_color, and $dog_name   are created for each instance of a class. This allows you to change what is in the properties for that instance   $lab  without changing the properties for other.  Once the instance is created, you can then access any methods by using the object name  $lab  and the   Example 3-5.  Basic program structure including a library, object, and method call in lab.php  $lab->display_properties  ;  method name  display_properties .  <?php require_once 'dog.php' ; $lab = new Dog; $lab->display_properties  ; ?>  in the dog.php file.  Figure 3-1 shows the successful output of the lab.php program, which includes the Dog class contained   Figure 3-1.

Add a speak method to the Dog class to give each instance the ability to “bark”.   Hint: Include a print  or echo  statement in your method. Add a call to your speak  method after the call to the display_properties method in the lab.php file.  2.  Create a second object from the Dog class in the lab.php file called $chow. Call   the speak method  1  to make him “bark”.  3.  Create a new library file that contains a class of another animal of your choice.   Within that class, create four properties that provide characteristics of that animal.  Include a method that will print each of these characteristics. Also include a  method that will cause the animal to speak. Create another file that will use this  library file to create an instance of the class. The program should also call the  method to display the properties and the method to cause the animal to speak.    1.    2.   6.    7.   Program errors—If you encountered errors when trying this example, check the following:   Did you name the class  Dog  and the file name  dog.php  the same? Make sure the file  ending is .php and not .txt for both the dog.php and lab.php files.   In the require_once statement in the lab.php file, is the file name exactly the same as the  dog.php file?  3.  Are the dog.php and lab.php files in the same folder?   4.    Did  you  include  the  same  amount  of  opening   {   and  closing   }   brackets  in  both  programs?  5.    Did you forget any semicolons  ; ?   For  each  $this  statement,  make  sure  the  $  is  part  of  this  and  not  of  the  property     $this->dog_weight .   For any other errors, copy and paste your error into a search engine to find possible  solutions. Remember, the error may be in either the Apache or PHP error logs  see Chapter  1 for details .  Return Method  In Chapter 2, the business rules tier was defined to contain modules of code that return information  requested, but do not provide an interface or format for displaying the data returned. In the previous  example, the Dog class violates this requirement. However, you can fix this problem with just a few code  changes to the dog.php and lab.php files.  The print statement in the Dog class should be replaced. However, you want to pass multiple values    dog_weight, dog_color, dog_breed, and dog_name  back to the program that has called it. There are many  ways that you can accomplish this task. However, since you are just starting programming, let’s keep it  simple. We can create a comma-delimitated string easily by reformatting the original string. You can replace  the print statement with  Return "$this->dog_weight, $this->dog_breed, $this->dog_color.";  The new Dog class would now contain what’s shown in Example 3-6.  84   Chapter 3   Modular prograMMing  Example 3-6.  Basic Dog class with return statement—dog.php  <?php class Dog { private $dog_weight = 0; private $dog_breed = "no breed"; private $dog_color = "no color"; private $dog_name = "no name";   function get_properties   {   return "$this->dog_weight,$this->dog_breed,$this->dog_color.";   } } ?>   in php 7, you can enable Scalar type hints. php 7 provides the developer the ability to declare the      Note  data type that is expected to be returned. the function in example 3-6 could be coded as follows.  declare strict_types=1 ; function get_properties   : string { return "$this->dog_weight,$this->dog_breed,$this->dog_color."; }  if the declare statement is not included or strict_types=0, the data type will not be enforced. the current  valid data types that can be used are string, int, float, and bool.  Since Scalar type hints are not backward compatable, they are not used in the examples in this book.  You now need to adjust the lab.php file to be able to accept what has been passed back from the   get_properties method  display_properties is renamed get_properties to reflect that it no longer  displays the properties; it now returns them . You can accomplish this by creating a property in the lab.php  file to receive what has been passed back from the get_properties method.  $dog_properties = $lab->get_properties  ;  no weight, no breed, no color  If you were to use the print function to display $dog_properties at this point, you would display:  However, we intended to produce a similar result as was shown previously. You can do this, but you   need to be able to break the string into three pieces based on the “,” delimiter. Luckily there are PHP methods  available that can easily accomplish this task. The explode method will break a string based on a delimiter.   85   Chapter 3   Modular prograMMing  The substrings  pieces of the string  can then be dropped into individual properties using a list object. For  our needs, you can split the $dog_properties string as follows.  list $dog_weight, $dog_breed, $dog_color  = explode ',', $dog_properties ;  For more information on the explode function, visit:  http:  php.net manual en function.explode.php  This will drop no weight into $dog_weight, no breed into $dog_breed, and no color into $dog_color.  These three properties are also being created inside the lab.php program in this same line of code. I happen  to give them the same names as their counterparts in the Dog class. However, remember if you had not  created the Dog class, you would not know the original variable names. It would not matter, because you can  call them anything you want and accomplish the same task.  Now that you have the variables containing the information, you can recreate the original print   statement in the lab.php program instead of in the dog.php library.  print "Dog weight is $dog_weight. Dog breed is $dog_breed. Dog color is $dog_color.";  Notice that you did not include the $this pointer. You are not executing this statement within a class.  You don’t create instances of the lab.php program. There is only one instance of the program  because it is  not a class and cannot have multiple instances . So the $this pointer is unnecessary.  The new lab.php program would now look like Example 3-7.  Example 3-7.  The lab.php program with print statement  <?php require_once "dog.php" ; $lab = new Dog; $dog_properties = $lab->get_properties  ; list $dog_weight, $dog_breed, $dog_color  = explode ',', $dog_properties ; print "Dog weight is $dog_weight. Dog breed is $dog_breed. Dog color is $dog_color."; ?>  Assuming there are no errors in your program, the output will be the same as Figure 3-1, unchanged   from the previous version of the program. However, the Dog class now meets one of the standards of the  business rules tier by returning information to the program that calls it without attempting to format the  output. The lab.php program now handles formatting the output.  Do It          86  1.  Adjust the speak method in the dog.php file to return the bark string but not  print it. Also adjust the call to the method in the lab.php file to display the  output of the string. You can accept the string from the method and print the  string in one line of code using syntax similar to the following:  print $lab->speak  ;  2.  Adjust the $chow object in the lab.php file to properly handle the return of the   properties string and the speak string.  3.  Adjust the animal class to return any strings instead of printing them. Adjust the   program that makes an instance of the animal class to accept and display the  strings that are returned.   Chapter 3   Modular prograMMing  Set Methods  This example is still very limited because you can’t currently adjust the values in the properties to relate to  the actual objects you created  such as $lab . In order to adjust these properties, you must have some ability  to access the properties from the program that uses the object  lab.php . However, because of encapsulation  and security concerns, you do not want to expose the properties to be directly manipulated by the calling  program. Object-oriented programming standards require that you create your properties as “private”    as you have done already  and then use actual methods in the class to change any values.  Security and reliability—Creating set methods in classes provides the ability for the class to  verify that the information that is to be placed in a property is valid before the property is  updated. If this verification is not done before changing the value in a property corruption  of  data  could  take  place.  After  the  fact,  it  may  be  impossible  or  very  difficult  to  correct  invalid data that has been accepted. Set methods can reject invalid data and return error  messages to the calling program.  A set method allows values to be passed into the method. These values can then be verified   before updating the properties in the object. Parameters  values  are passed into a method between the  parentheses    in the method call.  $dog_error_message = $lab->set_dog_name 'Fred' ;  If the set_dog_name method exists within the Dog class and accepts a string representing the name of   the dog, you could use a method call similar to the previous code. This call would pass the string "Fred" into  the set_dog_name method. It also provides the ability for the set method to return a value into the property  $dog_error_message to indicate if the property was updated properly. You can simply pass a ‘TRUE' or  ‘FALSE’ Boolean value back from the method to indicate the status of the update. The calling program then  can determine how to handle the status of the update.  If you simply pass back a ‘TRUE' or ‘FALSE' you can use a simplified version of the PHP conditional   statement, called the ternary operator to check $dog_error_message.  print  $dog_error_message  ==  TRUE  ?  'Name  update  successful '  :  'Name  update  not  successful ';  For more information on the ternary conditional operator, visit  http:  php.net manual en language.operators.comparison.php  Security and performance—Use caution when display error messages to actual live users of  your applications. You can provide too much information and expose your program code  unnecessarily. Displaying a generic error message to the user may be a safer option. In live  applications, log files should be created to record errors and access to the application itself.  With this format, the calling program  lab.php  can easily determine the status of the update and   display a corresponding message. The message between the ? and the :  “Name update successful”  will  display if the string in $dog_error_message is ‘TRUE'. If the value in $dog_error_message is ‘FALSE' the  string between the : and the ;  “Name update not successful”  will display.  87   Chapter 3   Modular prograMMing  Example 3-8.  The lab.php file with set methods and error checking  <?php require_once "dog.php" ; $lab = new Dog;    -------------------Set Properties-------------------------- $dog_error_message = $lab->set_dog_name 'Fred' ; print $dog_error_message == TRUE ? 'Name update successful ' : 'Name update not  successful ';   $dog_error_message = $lab->set_dog_weight 50 ; print $dog_error_message == TRUE ? 'Weight update successful ' : 'Weight update not  successful ';   $dog_error_message = $lab->set_dog_breed 'Lab' ; print $dog_error_message == TRUE ? 'Breed update successful ' : 'Breed update not  successful ';   $dog_error_message = $lab->set_dog_color 'Yellow' ; print $dog_error_message == TRUE ? 'Color update successful ' : 'Color update not  successful ';   -----------------------------Get Properties--------------------------- $dog_properties = $lab->get_properties  ; list $dog_weight, $dog_breed, $dog_color  = explode ',', $dog_properties ; print "Dog weight is $dog_weight. Dog breed is $dog_breed. Dog color is $dog_color."; ?>  In Example 3-8, lab.php now has the ability to pass information into the properties in the $lab object  of the Dog class. It also determines if the update for each property was successful and responds accordingly.  There are opportunities in this example to be more efficient with the amount of code that you have created.  However, we will hold off on efficiency until you have gathered a few more skills.  The lab.php code now calls a set method for each property to be updated  set_dog_name,    set_dog_breed, set_dog_weight, and set_dog_color  and passes information into each method.   Notice that strings are passed into each method, except for the set_dog_weight method, which accepts an  integer  whole number  value.  You now need to create set methods within the Dog class. Each method now accepts a parameter  string   or integer  and returns a ‘TRUE' or ‘FALSE' value. The method is created in a style similar to the previous  get_properties method that you created. Let’s keep the validation process simple for now and you’ll learn  how to improve it in later chapters.  function set_dog_name $value  { $error_message = TRUE;  ctype_alpha $value  && strlen $value   dog_name = $value : $error_message = FALSE; return $error_message; }  The set_dog_name method will accept a string into the $value property  parameter  defined in the   function header  function set_dog_name $value  . Next, the method creates a property $error_message  and provides an initial value of TRUE. This property  along with the $value property  will only exist while   the method is executing. As soon as the execution hits the } closing bracket, these properties will no longer  be available.  88   Programming note—TRUE and FALSE are constants that are included as part of the PHP  language. Constants cannot be changed and are in all caps. TRUE is actually represented  internally as a 1 and FALSE is represented internally as a 0.  Chapter 3   Modular prograMMing     Note    in php 7, Scalar type hints can be used to enforce the data type being passed and returned.  declare strict_types = 1 ; function set_dog_name string $value  : string { $error_message = TRUE;  ctype_alpha $value  && strlen $value   dog_name = $value : $error_message = FALSE; return $error_message; }  if the declare line is not included or strict_types = 0, the data type will not be enforced. to allow for  backward compatability, the examples in this textbook will not show the use of Scalar type hints.   Programming  note—&&  is  an  AND  operator.  In  order  for  the   ctype_alpha $value   &&  strlen $value  < 21  statement to be TRUE, $value must include only alphabetic characters  and must be fewer than 21 characters.  A ternary operator looks at the two possible statuses of the $value property  which contains whatever   was passed into the method .        1.  The ctype method is used to determine if the characters in $value are alphabetic    ctype_alpha $value  .  2.  The strlen method is used to determine if the length of the string in $value is   less than 21 characters  strlen $value  < 21 .  To learn about additional ctype functions, visit:   http:  php.net manual en book.ctype.php.  If the $value property contains alphabetic characters only and is less than 21 characters, the $dog_name   property is updated with the value that has been passed. If there are non-alphabetic characters or the length of  the string is more than 20 characters, the $error_message is updated with a FALSE value  indicating the update  did not occur . Finally, the value in $error_message  either TRUE or FALSE  is returned to the calling program.  Security and performance—This process may be a bit confusing now. However, it is important  to create secure programs. Whenever an application or object accepts information from an  outside source  such as another program or user  the information must be validated. This  validation should include limitations on the size of the information accepted, along with  other restrictions. Data that has been passed across the Internet  such as from the user’s  browser to a web server  can be intercepted and changed. It is vital that the information  be verified within the application on the server before it is used. Validation may be done in  the browser  via JavaScript  to ensure the user has entered correct information. However,  as stated, packet stiffing programs can intercept that information and change it before it is  received by an application on a web server.  89   Chapter 3   Modular prograMMing  One final note before you look at the code changes. PHP provides several operations to compare two values.   The following table provides a summary of these operators, including the new PHP 7 Spaceship Operator.                          Operation            Result – returns TRUE if...                         $a == $b             $a and $b are equal ignoring cases                         $a === $b            $a and $b equal if case is the same                         $a != $b, $a   $b   $a and $b are not equal ignoring cases                         $a !== $b            $a and $b are not equal or not same case                         $a < $b              $a is less than $b                         $a <= $b             $a is less than or equal to $b                         $a > $b              $a is greater than $b                         $a >= $b             $a is greater than or equal to $b                         ------------------------------------------------------  Available with PHP 7   $a   $b            returns -1 if $a < b, returns 0   if $a equals $b                                              returns 1 if $a > $b  In addition, the Null Coalesce Operator can be used to check if a value is ‘set’  contains something    before it is used in a ternary operation.  $dog_name = $_POST['value'] ?? 'No Name';  In this example, if something exists in value, it is placed in $dog_name. If value is not set, No Name is   placed in $dog_name. This operator is available in PHP 7. To allow for backward capability, the examples in  this book will not demonstrate this operator.  Let’s update the Dog class to include all the set methods needed.  <?php class Dog {    ------------------------------------ Properties ----------------------------------------- private $dog_weight = 0; private $dog_breed = "no breed"; private $dog_color = "no color"; private $dog_name = "no name";   }  Example 3-9.  Dog class with set methods in dog.php     ------------------------------ Set Methods ---------------------------------------------- function set_dog_name $value  { $error_message = TRUE;  ctype_alpha $value  && strlen $value   dog_name = $value : $error_message = FALSE; return $error_message; } function set_dog_weight $value  { $error_message = TRUE;  ctype_digit $value  &&  $value > 0 && $value  dog_weight = $value :  $error_message = FALSE; return $error_message; }  90   Chapter 3   Modular prograMMing  function set_dog_breed $value  { $error_message = TRUE;  ctype_alpha $value  && strlen $value   dog_breed = $value : $error_message = FALSE; return $error_message; } function set_dog_color $value  { $error_message = TRUE;  ctype_alpha $value  && strlen $value   dog_color = $value : $error_message = FALSE; return $error_message; } } function get_properties   { return "$this->dog_weight,$this->dog_breed,$this->dog_color."; } } ?>   Program  design  recommendation—When  coding  and  testing  your  programs,  code  just  one set method. Then test the method to correct errors. After you have one successful set  method, copy and paste it in your code and make the necessary changes. Do not attempt  to completely code a program before testing it. Program piece by piece, then test. Although  you may think that this slows down your coding, actually this is not true. By catching errors  with each small addition to your program it will be easier to find them. If you attempt to  code a complete program you may have lots of errors and could spend a lot of time trying  to hunt down each error. If you are having difficulty finding an error, comment out  using      the new lines of code in your program and retest. If all is okay, then gradually  just a  few lines at a time  remove the comment lines      from your code lines and retest. This  process should help you to find the lines of code that might be causing problems.  Security  and  performance—In  a  live  environment  the  programmer  should  not  display  details to the users as to what caused an update to be unsuccessful. Providing too much  information can inform hackers on what can be changed to successfully update properties  with  invalid  information.  Pass  the  details  of  what  caused  the  unsuccessful  update  to  a  secure log file on a server.  The code is starting to get lengthy. However, each of the set functions is very similar. As you code   the set functions, you will find that this is a common occurrence. It also allows you to quickly create  set methods once you have a working error free example by copying and pasting working methods and  making simple changes. In Example 3-9 different string lengths are determined depending on the type of  information being updated. Also, the $set_dog_weight method checks for numeric values in the string  passed, instead of alphabetic characters. Otherwise, the methods are almost identical.  Figure 3-2 demonstrates the output when valid information is passed into each property. The   ‘successful’ messages display. Also note that the get_properties method displays the new updated values  for each property. In a live environment you might consider not displaying the successful messages and only  displaying the not successful messages.  91   Chapter 3   Modular prograMMing  Figure 3-2.  Output of successful update via set methods in Dog class—dog.php and lab.php  Figure 3-3 tests the output generated when invalid information has been passed to the set methods.   Note that the default values are still in the properties that did not get updated. This stresses the need to  include default values in case some properties do not get updated. In PHP, properties that are displayed and  are NULL  have no value  do normally display a blank space for output. For example, if $dog_weight did not  have a default value, the output would display "Dog weight is .".  Figure 3-3.  Output with invalid weight  1000  and invalid breed  ‘Lab12’  in Dog class—dog.php and lab.php  Program design recommendation—Although PHP is friendly and will attempt to change  NULL values to spaces when displayed, it is not good programming to assume this will  occur.  Many  program  languages  will  not  do  this  conversion  for  you  and  will  display  error messages when attempting to display properties with NULL values. Also, when using  properties to do mathematical calculations, it is very important to set default values. PHP  will, again, attempt to convert NULL values to zeros for calculations. However, in some cases  this will not occur and an error message will display. In many program languages, error  messages will occur when attempting to do a calculation with NULL values. Establishing  programming habits that work for all languages will help you quickly develop skills for  multiple languages.  92   Chapter 3   Modular prograMMing  Do It    1.  Create an additional property  $dog_gender  in the Dog class. Create a set   method  set_dog_gender . Determine if a valid value  Male, Female  has been  passed into the set method. You can use the following code or develop your own  version to check for valid information.   $value == 'Male'  $value == 'Female'  ? $this->dog_gender =   $value : $error_message = FALSE;     2.  Go to php.net and search for a method that will allow the checking of any case  of “Male” or “Female” from 1. Update the conditional statement to allow any  version  Male, MALE, male, Female, FEMALE, female, and so on . Hint: The  characters in $value can be changed to all uppercase or all lowercase using the  strtoupper or strtolower methods. Then check the string as all uppercase   MALE, FEMALE  or all lowercase  male, female  characters.  Get Methods  In our previous examples, you created a get_properties method that returned multiple properties at the  same time. This is a valid and useful method. However, it is common to have a get method to match each  set method. This provides both write  set method  and read  get method  capabilities for the properties in  a method. In some situations you may want to only provide a get method without a set method  making the  property read-only . We could  although rarely done  provide a set method without a get method  making  the property write-only .  Get methods are actually much easier to code than set methods. No verification of data is necessary   because you are reading the data and not updating it.  function get_dog_name   { return $this->dog_name; }  All that is necessary in the get method is the return statement, which returns the value in the property   without the user of the object having direct access to the property.  Example 3-10.  Dog class with set and get methods—dog.php  <?php class Dog {    ----------------------------------------- Properties ------------------------------------ private $dog_weight = 0; private $dog_breed = "no breed"; private $dog_color = "no color"; private $dog_name = "no name";   }  93   Chapter 3   Modular prograMMing     ---------------------------------- Set Methods ------------------------------------------ function set_dog_name $value  { $error_message = TRUE;  ctype_alpha $value  && strlen $value   dog_name = $value : $error_message = FALSE; return $error_message; } function set_dog_weight $value  { $error_message = TRUE;  ctype_digit $value  &&  $value > 0 && $value  dog_weight = $value :  $error_message = FALSE; return $error_message; } function set_dog_breed $value  { $error_message = TRUE;  ctype_alpha $value  && strlen $value   dog_breed = $value : $error_message = FALSE; return $error_message; } function set_dog_color $value  { $error_message = TRUE;  ctype_alpha $value  && strlen $value   dog_color = $value : $error_message = FALSE; return $error_message; }    ----------------------------------------- Get Methods ----------------------------------- function get_dog_name   { return $this->dog_name; } function get_dog_weight   { return $this->dog_weight; } function get_dog_breed   { return $this->dog_breed; } function get_dog_color   { return $this->dog_color; } function get_properties   { return "$this->dog_weight,$this->dog_breed,$this->dog_color."; } } ?>  94   Chapter 3   Modular prograMMing  The code is lengthy. However, as pointed out previously, like the set methods, the get methods are very  similar to each other. Once you have created one successful get method, you can copy and paste it to create  the other methods. All that needs to change for each get method is the name of the method and the property  being returned.  Example 3-11.  The lab.php program using set and get methods  <?php require_once "dog.php" ; $lab = new Dog;    ------------------------------Set Properties-------------------------- $dog_error_message = $lab->set_dog_name 'Fred' ; print $dog_error_message == TRUE ? 'Name update successful ' : 'Name update not  successful '; $dog_error_message = $lab->set_dog_weight 50 ; print $dog_error_message == TRUE ? 'Weight update successful ' : 'Weight update not  successful ';   $dog_error_message = $lab->set_dog_breed 'Lab' ; print $dog_error_message == TRUE ? 'Breed update successful ' : 'Breed update not  successful '; $dog_error_message = $lab->set_dog_color 'Yellow' ; print $dog_error_message == TRUE ? 'Color update successful ' : 'Color update not  successful ';    ------------------------------Get Properties-------------------------- print $lab->get_dog_name   . " "; print $lab->get_dog_weight   . " "; print $lab->get_dog_breed   . " "; print $lab->get_dog_color   . " "; $dog_properties = $lab->get_properties  ; list $dog_weight, $dog_breed, $dog_color  = explode ',', $dog_properties ; print "Dog weight is $dog_weight. Dog breed is $dog_breed. Dog color is $dog_color."; ?>  When viewing the code in Example 3-11, note that the print statements call the get methods  print  $lab->get_dog_name   . " "; . The order of operations, which will be discussed in more detail in a  later chapter, causes the method  get_dog_name    to be executed first, even though normally a line of code  would execute from left to right. The method returns the value in dog_name  the string "Fred" . The string is  placed in the same location in which the method call was located. After the get method executes, the code  line is now  print "Fred" . " ";  Fred    Then the code line executes from left to right, producing the output  Programming note—Unlike properties, methods must NOT be included in quotes  "" or '' .  The string must be broken apart and concatenated using the '.', as shown in the example.  If a method is included IN quotes, PHP will display an error message.  95   Chapter 3   Modular prograMMing  As you can see from Figure 3-4, the get methods successfully display the updated values in the   properties. If any properties were not updated, the get methods would display the default values.  Program design recommendation—While in coding and testing phase it is a good idea to  display the values in your properties often to ensure that they are updated at the proper  times. However, when you move a program from testing mode to production you should  reduce the amount of display shown to the users. It probably is not necessary to show the  users the update values in properties. It is usually best to just indicate to the users that the  update was successful. You can simply comment out your unneeded print code lines before  production. This then could help to quickly debug future upgrades to the application by  simply removing comments from those lines.  Figure 3-4.  Dog class output with set and get methods  Do It 1.     In addition to creating an additional property  $dog_gender  and set method in  the Dog class, create a get method to display the updated values. Also update the  lab.php file to include a print statement  similar to the examples in this section   to call the get methods.  Constructor Method  One difficulty with the previous examples is the amount of calls to set routines that would be required if you  are initially creating an object and populating the properties of the object with values. The Dog class requires  that you call four set methods  set_dog_name, set_dog_breed, set_dog_color, and set_dog_weight  in  order to place values in all the properties. You can use a much more efficient way of updating all these  properties at once. This could reduce the code in the lab.php file. You could then use the set routines in the  Dog class to make any changes  maybe the dog gained some weight  after you have provided initial values.  The initial values are not default values. You still need default values in case the initial values are invalid.  When an instance of a class  object  is created in memory, the operating system executes a constructor   method that builds the object with any properties and methods. The system also builds tables in memory  to keep track of the location of the object and the values that exist in the properties of the object. When  the object is no longer needed, the operating system’s garbage collector will call by the object’s destructor  method, which will remove it from memory.  96   Chapter 3   Modular prograMMing  You can also include a constructor method that will automatically be called when the object is placed   in memory. When the code line that creates the object  $lab = new Dog;  is executed, it looks for a  constructor method in the object. If it exists, the method is executed. You can pass all the initial values for  the properties into this constructor method via same line that creates the object.  $lab = new Dog 'Fred', 'Lab', 'Yellow', 50 ;  This becomes a much more efficient way of providing the initial values from within the lab.php program. The constructor method is a generic format with a function name __construct  note there are two   underscores before the word construct .  <?php class Dog {          function __construct $value1, $value2, $value3, $value4           {             code to update properties          }    other methods } ?>  You can use the existing set methods in the constructor to update the properties. You will need to   collect any messages  TRUE FALSE  and return them to the calling program  lab.php . You can use a similar  procedure as you initially coded with the handling of the get_properties method.  Example 3-12.  Dog class with constructor—dog.php  <?php class Dog {    ----------------------------------------- Properties ------------------------------------ private $dog_weight = 0; private $dog_breed = "no breed"; private $dog_color = "no color"; private $dog_name = "no name"; private $error_message = "??";    ---------------------------------- Constructor ------------------------------------------ function __construct $value1, $value2, $value3, $value4  { $name_error = $this->set_dog_name $value1  == TRUE ?

'TRUE,' : 'FALSE,'; $weight_error= $this->set_dog_weight $value4  == TRUE ? 'TRUE' : 'FALSE';   $this->error_message = $name_error . $breed_error . $color_error . $weight_error; }   ------------------------------------toString---------------------------------------------- public function __toString   {         return $this->error_message; }   ... There are no other code changes to dog.php below this line.   97   Chapter 3   Modular prograMMing  For more information about the __construct method, visit:   Examples: http:  php.net manual en language.oop5.decon.php   Videos: https:  www.thenewboston.com videos.php?cat=11&video=17181  First, let’s discuss the use of the special method called __toString  note the two underscores  in   Example 3-12. Constructor methods are not allowed to return information  by default . The return  statement cannot be used within the constructor. In order to return error messages created in the  constructor to the calling program  lab.php , you must trick the program. The __toString method allows  the programmer to decide what will occur if an attempt is made to use the print  or echo  method with  the object name  print $lab; . Normally an error message would occur claiming the object cannot be  converted to a string  print and echo can only display strings . This can be overridden by including a  __toString method with a statement that returns a string. You can overcome this problem of being able to  return the error messages by allowing the value in the $error_message property to be returned if the print  $lab; statement is executed.  For more information on the __toString method and other magic methods visit   http:  php.net manual en language.oop5.magic.php.  The TRUE and FALSE constants that are returned by the set methods also cause a problem because they   are constants and not strings. If you attempt to convert these constants to a string using a method  such as  strval TRUE ; , the values that they represent  1 for TRUE, 0 for FALSE  would become a string instead of  ‘TRUE' or ‘FALSE'. Therefore, they cannot be returned via the __toString method. To overcome this problem  we create the following code in the constructor to do a conversion from TRUE to ‘TRUE' or FALSE to ‘FALSE'.  $name_error = $this->set_dog_name $value1  == TRUE ? 'TRUE,' : 'FALSE,';  The order of operations will cause the set_dog_name method to execute before any of part of this code.  The set_dog_name method returns TRUE or FALSE  constants . Assuming that the method returns a TRUE after  the execution, the code line would now be  $name_error = TRUE == TRUE ? 'TRUE,' : 'FALSE,';  The order of operations then requires that the comparison  TRUE == TRUE  be evaluated. Of course, this   evaluates to TRUE. The statements between the ? and the : are used.  $name_error = 'TRUE,';  Thus $name_error is set to the string "TRUE,", which is now a string, not a constant. Also note that a ‘,’ has been added in preparation for the next ‘TRUE' or ‘FALSE' value. Each value passed    except the last value  must be separated by a ‘,’ to allows the string to be separated later.  The other three similar lines are evaluated and also place a ‘TRUE,’ or ‘FALSE,’ in the error message   properties  the weight error evaluation does not include a comma at the end of the string since it is the last  one evaluated .  The last line of code in the constructor is evaluated.  $this->error_message = $name_error . $breed_error . $color_error . $weight_error;  98   Chapter 3   Modular prograMMing  This line places the values of each error property into the error_message property. If all the updates   were successful, the $error_message property would contain  "TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE"  apart the results of the string.  Notice that each item passed includes a “,’ for separation except the last item. This is necessary to break   Example 3-13.  The lab.php file calling a constructor  <?php require_once "dog.php" ; $lab = new Dog 'Fred','Lab','Yellow','100' ; list $name_error, $breed_error, $color_error, $weight_error  = explode ',', $lab ; print $name_error == 'TRUE' ? 'Name update successful ' : 'Name update not  successful '; print $breed_error == 'TRUE' ? 'Breed update successful ' : 'Breed update not  successful '; print $color_error == 'TRUE' ? 'Color update successful ' : 'Color update not  successful '; print $weight_error == 'TRUE' ? 'Weight update successful ' : 'Weight update not  successful ';    ------------------------------Set Properties--------------------------  ...There are no other changes to lab.php below this line.  There is a slight change to the creation of the object on the third line of Example 3-13.  $lab = new Dog 'Fred','Lab','Yellow','100' ;  You are now passing the initial values  Fred, Lab, Yellow,and 100  into the object via the constructor.   Otherwise, you would have to make four calls to set methods  set_dog_name, set_dog_breed, set_dog_ color, and set_dog_weight  to accomplish the same thing. This allows you to use the set methods for  updates that are needed after you have initially set up the object  $lab .  In order to determine if the updates to the four properties were successful, you must retrieve your   values  TRUE, TRUE, TRUE,TRUE  from the $error_message property in the object. The __toString method in  the Dog class allows you to do this by treating $lab as if it were a string. This allows you to use the explode  method in a similar process as the output to the get_properties method.  list $name_error, $breed_error, $color_error, $weight_error  = explode ',', $lab ;  This line of code will break the contents of $lab  TRUE, TRUE, TRUE,TRUE  by the commas and place each   part into the properties $name_error, $breed_error, $color_error, and $weight_error. Each of these  properties will now contain the string 'TRUE'. You can then evaluate your messages to see if the updates  were successful in a very similar technique that evaluated the results of the set methods.  print $name_error == 'TRUE' ? 'Name update successful ' : 'Name update not  successful ';  There are only a few minor differences between this format and the similar statements to evaluate   the results of the set methods. Each of these code lines uses a different error message for evaluation   $name_error, $breed_error, $color_error, and $weight_error . Previously you used the same property   $error_message  for all the results from the set methods. You are now evaluating the string 'TRUE' instead  of the constant TRUE  the only difference in the code is the actual quotes .  99   Chapter 3   Modular prograMMing  In Figure 3-5, the first four lines of output are produced from passing values into the constructor to   provide initial settings for each property. The next four lines of output are produced when the set methods  are used to change the values in the properties. The final four lines are produced from execution of the   get methods  showing the contents of each property . The last line of output was produced by the   get_properties method. Although the initial values  Fred, Lab, Yellow, and 100  are passed into the  constructor successfully, the values in each property were the changed using the set methods  passing  Sally, Labrador, Brown, and 5 .  Figure 3-5.  Output from dog.php and lab.php with the constructor, set, and get methods  Security and performance—Some would argue that it’s overkill to check for errors every  single time an update occurs. However, in the current environment with constant attempts  to corrupt data, it is necessary to be as careful as possible when doing updates. No program  is 100% protected from data corruption. Hopefully, you have noticed that once you develop  a routine of checking data, your data checking code lines become very similar each time.  Thus, by copying and pasting  with minor changes  code lines that successfully verify data,  you can greatly increase your security without adding a lot of extra coding time.  100   Chapter 3   Modular prograMMing  Do It    1.

Each   item  class  includes an item number, description, size, self, isle, amount,  and price. Each field must be verified for proper information before the entries  are accepted. Item numbers range from 00000 to 99999. The store has 16 isles   00-15 . No price in the store is greater than $1000. All entries are coded via a  constructor or set methods. After all entries have correctly been accepted, the  program will generate a report of the entries  using get methods .  Term Project  1.  Using the design from the Chapter 2 Term Project, create a PHP program that  will provide the interface for entering in the ABC Computer Parts Corporation  inventory items for the warehouse. The PHP class must verify the contents of  the information passed from each field  via the set methods  to ensure that  no corruption has taken place. Set and Get methods for each property must  exist in the class. The constructor should use the set methods to populate the  properties. Also create an interface program that will make an instance of the  class and test the ability to populate the properties. The test program should  generate a report of the item placed in inventory  similar to the output shown in  this chapter . The files created should use logic similar to what was shown in the  examples in this chapter.  107   Chapter 4  Secured User Interfaces  “All  great  ideas  look  like  bad  ideas  to  people  who  are  losers.

Prettyman, Learn PHP 7, DOI 10.1007 978-1-4842-1730-6_4  109   Chapter 4   SeCured uSer InterfaCeS  Secured User Interaction  In Chapter 2, the Hello World examples included user interaction  clicking a Submit button  to call a PHP  program. This chapter will use the HTML web form to accept information from the user and then pass this  information to a PHP program.  Do not trust your users! You must be prepared for any type of information your users will enter into a   web form. You must also make sure that you validate and secure information every time before accepting it  into your programs. You must remember that users may elect to not allow JavaScript to run in their browsers.  Therefore, your program cannot be dependent on JavaScript code for verification of input. You must be able  to handle these three scenarios:           1.   2.   3.   If the user is using an HTML5 capable browser, you can verify all input using  HTML5 before sending it to the PHP program on the web server.  If the user is using a browser that does not have HTML5  or complete HTML5   capability, you can verify all  or some  input using JavaScript. Then you can send  the validated information to the PHP program on the web server.  If the user is using a browser that does not have HTML5 capability and has  JavaScript disabled, the user input can still be verified by the PHP program on the  web server.  It is preferable to handle the initial verification using either of the first two methods. This would verify  the correct information before sending it to the server. Method 3 will cause more server calls because the  information must be sent to the server for verification, and then any error messages must be sent back to the  browser for the user to correct.  Even if you verify the information using method 1 or 2, when the PHP programs receives the   information on the web server, you will again evaluate that you have received valid information. Even  though the user may have sent valid information, packet sniffing programs can change valid information  into harmful information.  HTML5 Form Validation  When building an HTML5 form, you can validate information entered into text boxes. However, browsers that  have not implemented the HTML5 techniques  or all of HTML5  will treat the objects  such as text boxes   as if they were normal non-validation objects. The information in the boxes will be accepted without any  verification. Therefore, you must also include a JavaScript routine to catch anything not validated by HTML5.  Security and performance —Secure programming is just part of the complete process of  protecting your information. The files, directories, servers, networks, and databases must  also be properly secured. In addition, any highly important information  such as credit  card numbers  must be sent across a secure channel  HTTPS  to additionally protect the  information. User IDs and passwords should be encrypted to make it difficult for packet  sniffing software.  You will continue with the example from Chapter 3 by updating the Dog class example to accept   information from the user for your properties. The Dog class already has security in place, so you will not  need to make any additional security updates to the class.  110   Chapter 4   SeCured uSer InterfaCeS  Example 4-1.

Just below the  CSS code is a small amount of JavaScript code. This code switches the JS division to be visible  $ "JS" . show    and hides the noJS division. There is only one slight difference between the forms in the JS and noJS  divisions. You should notice that the noJS form does not call the validate_input JavaScript function.  Why is this?  The answer is simple. If the browser does not have JavaScript enabled, the short JavaScript routine to   hide and show the divisions will not run. Thus, the JS division will not be displayed in the browser  because  the CSS at the top of the code set its display to none . The noJS division will be visible instead. This allows  a browser that does not have JavaScript to send the information entered by the user directly to the PHP  program on the web server. Hopefully, the user has an HTML5 browser that will still validate the information  before it is sent to the server  1 in this scenario . However, even if they don’t, the information will be  validated on the server  3 in this scenario, as you will see later in the chapter.  If JavaScript is enabled in the browser, the hide-show routine will “hide” the noJS division and show  the JS division. The form that submits the information to the validate_input function will display in the  browser. This will allow browsers that have JavaScript enabled to validate information entered by using the  validate_input JavaScript function. If the user has an HTML5 browser  1 in this scenario , this might be  overkill, since HTML5 can validate the information. However, you must be prepared for users who have not  upgraded their browsers  2 in this scenario .  Figure 4-1.  The lab.html file  In Example 4-1, the dog_name, dog_breed, and dog_color text boxes set field lengths to the same  maximum values that were validated in the Dog class in Chapter 3. They also use the HTML5 pattern  property  [a-zA-Z]  to only allow alphabetic characters. The title property is used to display an error to  the user if incorrect information is entered. The dog_weight text box uses an input type of number, which  automatically restricts the input. The min and max parameters are also set to restrict the dog’s weight  between 1 and 120 lbs. As mentioned, the browser might not interpret these restrictions if it has not fully  implemented HTML5 standards. Therefore, you still must also validate the data using the JavaScript  validate_input method to be sure that all validation has been completed.  112   Chapter 4   SeCured uSer InterfaCeS  HTML5 capable browsers will validate the information before it is sent to the validate_input   function. Thus, if the browser is completely HTML5, all the information will also pass the validation from  the JavaScript method. You could check the browser version to determine if the browser is 100% HTML5.  However, that would take more JavaScript coding and is unnecessary since the application accomplishes its  task without more code.  It is important that all validations are consistent throughout the process of accepting information from   the user and passing that information to the application. HTML and JavaScript code are easily viewable  by the user  you can “View Source” from within a browser to see the code . Validation of any highly secure  format should be done from within a program language that is compiled and secured on a server.  Security  and  performance  —You  may  be  wondering  why  you  should  even  bother  to  validate on the user side. Why not just pass all the information to the program on the server  and  let  that  program  tell  you  if  you  need  to  fix  anything?  Some  programmers  actually  do this. However, the goal is to have an efficient program. By attempting to validate the  information in the user’s browser, you reduce the number of calls to from the server. This  improves the application and web server performance and efficiency. In addition, as you  will see, by validating in the browser, the contents in the text boxes will still be available  to the user to adjust. If validation is done on the web server, information in the HTML  form will be lost because the web page will be reloaded each time you send and receive  information from the web server.  The goal of validation in the browser is to make sure that the user provides information that meets the  requirements of the program on the server. You may initially cringe that this example displays the format of  required information to the user. However, the goal is not to secure the data; the goal is to make sure the data  is valid. It is not a security breach to inform the user of the data format requested.     The form uses the parameter onSubmit to pass all information that has been entered to the JavaScript  method  validate_input . The this keyword indicates that all information from this object  which is the  form itself and all the text boxes  is passed to the method. The return keyword indicates that the method  will return a TRUE or FALSE status. The HTML code will submit the form to the PHP program  lab.php  on  the server if a TRUE status has been returned from the validate_input method.  Do It    1.  Adjust Example 4-1 to include gender information from the Do It in Chapter 3.    Use a text box to receive the information from the user. Try to use HTML5 to  restrict the type of information the user can enter in the text box. Test your code.  113   Chapter 4   SeCured uSer InterfaCeS  JavaScript Validation  Although this is not a JavaScript book, it will take a brief look at form validation used in the JavaScript  method validate_input.  Example 4-2.  Form validation via JavaScript—validator.js  function allalphabetic the_string  {    var letters =  ^[a-zA-Z ]+$ ;    if  the_string.match letters       {      return true;     } else     {     return false;    } }          ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- function validate_dog_name the_string  {         if   the_string.length > 0  &&  allalphabetic the_string   &&  the_string.length < 21           {           return true;         }         else         {           return false;         } }    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- function validate_dog_breed_color the_string  {     if   the_string.length > 0  &&  allalphabetic the_string   &&  the_string.length < 35           {            return true;         }         else         {            return false;         } } function validate_dog_weight the_string  {     if   the_string > 0 && this_string <= 120  &&  !isNaN the_string            {            return true;         }  114   Chapter 4   SeCured uSer InterfaCeS          else         {            return false;         } }    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- function validate_input form  {             var error_message = "";                     if  !validate_dog_name form.dog_name.value           {                        error_message += "Invalid dog name. ";         }                   if  !validate_dog_breed_color form.dog_breed.value           {             error_message += "Invalid dog breed. ";         }         if  !validate_dog_breed_color form.dog_color.value           {             error_message += "Invalid dog color. ";                     }         if  !validate_dog_weight form.dog_weight.value           {             error_message += "Invalid dog weight. ";         }         if  error_message.length > 0          {         alert error_message ;         return false;         }         else         {         return true;         } }           if  !validate_dog_breed_color form.dog_color.value           {             error_message += "Invalid dog color. ";                     }         if  !validate_dog_weight form.dog_weight.value           {             error_message += "Invalid dog weight. ";         }         if  error_message.length > 0          {         alert error_message ;         return false;         }  115   Chapter 4   SeCured uSer InterfaCeS          else         {         return true;         } }       In Example 4-1, the JavaScript file validator.js is attached to the lab.html file in the head section via   an HTML script tag. By placing the JavaScript validation in a separate file, you have simplified the HTML  file. The JavaScript file is dependent on the HTML file for display. Error messages are passed to an alert box   alert error_message ;  near the bottom of the method.  Programming  suggestion—By  passing  only  a  status   error  message   back  to  a  calling  program, you allow for flexibility. The calling program can then determine how to display  the information. This also allows you to easily reuse the method for other HTML forms.  Let’s work backward in reviewing the JavaScript code  Example 4-2 . In the HTML file, the onSubmit   parameter of the form tag calls the validate_input JavaScript method. This method controls all the  validation of each text box on the form. The method uses a series of if statements to call methods that will  validate the different types of text boxes. The format of each if statement is very similar.  if  !validate_dog_name form.dog_name.value    Each method called will return a true response if the validation passes and a false response if the   validation fails.  In JavaScript, the constants true and false are lowercase. In PHP they are uppercase.   By passing form into the validate_input function, all the parameters and values in the HTML form are   passed at the same time. You can select which parameter to use by using dot notation.  In the previous example, form.dog_name.value will pull the value that was entered in the dog_name text   box. The value that the user entered in this text box is passed into the validate_dog_name method.  if  !validate_dog_name form.dog_name.value   {     error_message += "Invalid dog name. "; }  The ! symbol in front of the function name means not. An if statement normally executes if the  response from a method  or comparison  is true. However, you want to save an error message in the  error_message property if the response returned from the method  validate_dog_name  is false  it did not  validated correctly . The ! symbol causes the if statement to do the reverse of what’s normal and execute if  the function returns a false value.  Each of the other validation methods works in similar ways. The methods check to see if the   information entered was in the correct format. If the information was correct, the method returns true. If the  information was not correct, the method returns false.  For more information on the JavaScript if conditional statement, visit  https:  www.thenewboston.com videos.php?cat=10&video=16960  For more information on JavaScript functions  methods , visit  https:  www.thenewboston.com videos.php?cat=10&video=16952  116   Chapter 4   SeCured uSer InterfaCeS  function validate_dog_name the_string  {         if   the_string.length > 0  &&  allalphabetic the_string   &&  the_string.length <= 20           {           return true;         }         else         {           return false;         } }  Each method accepts the value from the particular text box by passing it into the the_string property   function validate_dog_name the_string  . The if statement in each method does most of the work. In  the validate_dog_name method, the if statement attempts to check three requirements for the dog name.  The first part of the statement uses the length method to make sure the length of the string is greater than  zero. If the length of the string is not greater than zero, the user did not enter anything in the text box. Next,  the if statement passes the_string to an allalphabetic method to determine if the text box contains only  alphabetic characters  you will look at the function shortly . Finally the if statement checks the string length  again to make sure it has not exceeded 20 characters. The && symbol is an AND symbol that requires that all  three of these checks be true for the complete if statement to be considered true. If all three are true, the if  statement returns true to the validate_input method. If any of the three are false, the if statement returns  false to the validate_input method.  Programming note—JavaScript strings include built-in methods that automatically exist  once a variable has been created and set with a string value. In the examples in this chapter,  you use both the length method and the match method. The length method returns the  length of the string. The match method determines if the string contains a set of characters  that has been passed into the method  see the next example .  dog_name, dog_breed, and dog_color all require that only alphabetic characters be allowed. So you   created the allalphabetic method that can be called by each validation method instead of repeating the  same code.  function allalphabetic the_string  {     var letters =  ^[a-zA-Z ]+$ ;     if  the_string.match letters       {       return true;     }     else     {       return false;     } }  117   Chapter 4   SeCured uSer InterfaCeS  The allaphabetic method uses a regular expression to check for alphabetic characters. Most program  languages  including PHP  enable the programmer to create a regular expression that will check a string for  a required format.  var letters =  ^[a-zA-Z ]+$ ;  This line sets up the expression to determine if the string only has lowercase and or uppercase   alphabetic characters  a though z, A through Z . You will work more in detail with regular expressions within  PHP in a later chapter.  For more information on JavaScript regular expressions, visit  https:  developer.mozilla.org en-US docs Web JavaScript Guide Regular_Expressions  For more information on the JavaScript match method, visit  http:  www.w3schools.com jsref jsref_match.asp  One of the methods that exists in all JavaScript strings is the match method. This method compares the  contents of the string  the_string  to the regular expression  alphabetic characters in this example . If the  string meets the requirements of the expression  only contains alphabetic characters , then the method will  return true. Otherwise, it will return false. In this example, if the string is alphabetic, true is returned to the  if statement in the validate_dog_name  or validate_dog_color or validate_dog_breed  method. If any  part of the string contains something other than alphabetic characters, a false is returned to the if statement   which in turn will make the results of the if statement false even if the string size is correct .  Going back to the bottom of the JavaScript code, you determine what to return to the HTML program    lab.html .  if  !validate_dog_weight form.dog_weight.value           {             error_message += "Invalid dog weight. ";         }         if  error_message.length > 0          {         alert error_message ;         return false;         }         else         {         return true;         }  Each if statement at the bottom of the validate_input method will build an error message  such as   "Invalid dog weight."  and place it in the error_message property if the validation fails  If a false is  returned from the if statement . The += symbol concatenates what is currently in the property with what is  being placed into the property  so you don’t overwrite any messages that are already there .  The last if statement  if  error_message.length > 0  checks the length of the error_message   property. If it is greater than zero  error messages have been passed into the property , the program will  display the messages in an alert box and return false to the HTML program  lab.html . If the length is zero,  there were no error messages; true is passed back to the HTML program.     118   Chapter 4   SeCured uSer InterfaCeS  In Example 4-1, the format of the form tag will automatically cause a response if a true or false is  returned from the validate_input method. If true is returned  there were no validation problems , the  HTML program will send the form properties and values to the lab.php program on the web server. If false  is returned  there was at least one validation problem , the HTML program will not pass the information and  will stay visible in the browser. The alert box will display for the user to see what errors have occurred. When  the user closes the alert box, they will still be on the HTML page  with the information they had previously  entered . They can correct any incorrect information and click the Submit button  again  to revalidate the  information they have entered.  Figure 4-2.  The lab.html file with incorrect entries  Figure 4-3.  The lab.html file after failing JavaScript verification  119   Chapter 4   SeCured uSer InterfaCeS   different browsers react in different ways to JavaScript code. Internet explorer tries to block      Note  JavaScript code by default. If you see no results and are sure your code is correct, yet are receiving error  messages about missing methods  such as validate_input  it may be that your browser’s ability to execute  JavaScript is turned off. either turn it on in the settings of the browser or try a different browser that allows  JavaScript to run.   Security and performance—Although you have verified input on the HTML page, the data  could still cause harm to the system. The user could try to send HTML, JavaScript, and  even PHP code that could to cause harm. This could occur from bad information entered  in the HTML page, a packet sniffing program intercepting the data transferring to the PHP  page, or a program trying to bypass the HTML page altogether. No matter which of these  activities produced the harmful information, the PHP program will need to detect it and  handle the problem. Therefore, the receiving program  lab.php  must try to filter  clean  and remove harmful code  the data.  1.  Adjust Example 4-2 to validate the gender text box from the first Do It. Make sure  to include an error message to indicate the problem s . Also make sure the error  message is added to the $error_message property to be displayed with all other  error messages. Make sure to test your code for all possible problems with the  user entering data. Don’t forget to test if they do not enter any data.  Do It    PHP Filtering  It’s time to look at the changes required to the php file  lab.php . You need to be able to accept in the  properties and values  dog_name, dog_breed, dog_color, and dog_weight  from the HTML program.  However, you need to be concerned that someone might try to send information that could affect the  operation of the program or even crash the system in which it is operating.  This section takes two approaches to help reduce the possibility of harmful data. First, you will   determine if you have received all required information. If not, you will ask the user to return to the HTML  page  lab.html  to enter the information. This will, at least, make sure that you have all data and it meets the  validation provided by the HTML5 page and or JavaScript program  validator.js . Second, you will use  some existing PHP methods to filter out HTML, JavaScript, and PHP syntax from the data received. This will  reduce the chance that an executable statement will be passed into the program.  Example 4-3.  Partial listing of the top of lab.php with the clean_input method  <?php require_once "dog.php" ; function clean_input $value  { $bad_chars = array "{", "}", " ", " ", ";", ":", " ", " ", "$" ; $value = str_ireplace $bad_chars,"",$value ;    This part below is really overkill because the string replace above removed special characters $value = htmlentities $value ;    Removes any html from the string and turns it into &lt; format  120   Chapter 4   SeCured uSer InterfaCeS  $value = strip_tags $value ;    Strips html and PHP tags         if  get_magic_quotes_gpc            {                 $value = stripslashes $value ;    Gets rid of unwanted quotes         } return $value; } if   isset $_POST['dog_name']   &&  isset $_POST['dog_breed']   &&  isset $_POST['dog_ color']   &&  isset $_POST['dog_weight']    { $dog_name = clean_input $_POST['dog_name'] ; $dog_breed = clean_input $_POST['dog_breed'] ; $dog_color = clean_input $_POST['dog_color'] ; $dog_weight = clean_input $_POST['dog_weight'] ; $lab = new Dog $dog_name,$dog_breed,$dog_color,$dog_weight ; list $name_error, $breed_error, $color_error, $weight_error  = explode ',', $lab ; ...  For more information on the PHP function isset, visit  Examples: http:  php.net manual en function.isset.php  Videos: https:  www.thenewboston.com videos.php?cat=11&video=17087  For more information on $_POST, visit  Examples: http:  php.net manual en reserved.variables.post.php  Videos: https:  www.thenewboston.com videos.php?cat=11&video=17087  At the top of lab.php, you are adding several items to provide more secure code.  if   isset $_POST['dog_name']   &&  isset $_POST['dog_breed']   &&    isset $_POST['dog_color']   &&  isset $_POST['dog_weight']     This if statement uses the isset method and $_POST to verify that all four properties  dog_name,   dog_breed, dog_color, and dog_weight  have been passed into the program with the POST method. If all  items have been passed, you then will filter  clean  those items. If any of them have not been passed, an else  statement  that you will look at later  will request the user go back to the lab.html page to enter all needed  information.  $dog_name = clean_input $_POST['dog_name'] ; Each property is passed to the clean_input method  after it has been retrieved using the  $_POST method  to remove harmful tags. In this example, the $dog_name property  on the left  side of the = sign  will receive the cleaned information. function clean_input $value  { $bad_chars = array "{", "}", " ", " ", ";", ":", " ", " ", "$" ; $value = str_ireplace $bad_chars,"",$value ; $value = strip_tags $value ;    Strips html and PHP tags $value = htmlentities $value ;    Removes any html from the string and turns it into &lt; format  121   Chapter 4   SeCured uSer InterfaCeS  if  get_magic_quotes_gpc            {                 $value = stripslashes $value ;    Gets rid of unwanted quotes         } return $value; }   set_magic_quotes_runtime and magic_quotes_runtime has been removed since php 5.4. Magic      Note  quotes  since php 5.4  can no longer be set at runtime.   For more information on the str_ireplace method, visit  http:  php.net manual en function.str-ireplace.php  The clean_input method creates an array $bad_chars that contains a list of all special characters   you want to remove from the string  you will look at arrays in more detail later in this chapter and future  chapters . The str_ireplace method  $value = str_ireplace $bad_chars,"",$value ;  will replace  all these characters with ""  nothing, it removes them  from the $value property and place what is left into  $value. There may be occasions that you do want some of these special characters  for example in an SQL  statement . However, you do not need any of these for the input in this example, so you can remove them.     Note   It would be effective and efficient for this example to just remove the characters that are not valid. In  a real-world situation, you would not need to also include the stripslashes, htmlentities, and string_tags  methods  shown in the method . they are included here to demonstrate their use and why, in other situations,  you might use them.  The three PHP methods  stripslashes, htmlentities, and strip_tags  are used to convert harmful   code so it cannot be executed. The stripslashes method removes backslashes from quotes  which actually  can also done by the str_ireplace method . The htmlentities method converts HTML characters to their  equivalent HTML entity  for example a is converted to &039; . The strip_tags method removes any PHP  or HTML tags. If you were using SQL to update a database, you need to add additional functions to disable  any harmful SQL statements.  For more information on stripslashes, htmlentities, and strip_tags, visit  Examples – stripslashes: http:  php.net manual en function.stripslashes.php  Examples – htmlentities: http:  php.net manual en function.htmlentities.php  Examples – strip-tags: http:  php.net manual en function.strip-tags.php  Video – magic quotes and stripslashes: https:  www.youtube.com watch?v=NUqkUjbGuPY  Video – htmlentities: https:  www.thenewboston.com videos.php?cat=11&video=17058  Video – strip_tags: https:  www.youtube.com watch?v=rn_dnQFLt3U  122   Chapter 4   SeCured uSer InterfaCeS  Security  and  performance—It  is  extremely  important  that  the  program  filter  out  any  possible harmful information received from outside the application. It is much easier to  remove the harmful data initially, or reject the data initially, before it has been used or  saved. With major breaches in security today, this is an absolute MUST DO.  You could have also restricted which programs called the PHP program. The $__SERVER global variable   can assist you.  if $__SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'] == 'http:  www.mysite.com lab.html'  {     code executed if valid location } else {exit;}  For more information on the $__SERVER array, visit Examples: http:  php.net manual en reserved.variables.server.php Video: https:  www.thenewboston.com videos.php?cat=11&video=17047  This example code would reject any program that calls the lab.php program  except for the lab.html    program that is located at the site . The exit; command closes the program if it is not called from the  correct HTML page.  The filter methods demonstrated will not keep someone from entering “asabsbabsa” as a dog name.  However, these methods will keep any entry from being harmful.Example 4-4. Partial list of the bottom of  lab.php with the clean_input method  else { print " Missing or invalid parameters. Please go back to the lab.html page to enter valid  information. "; print " Dog Creation Page "; }  The true part of the if statement mentioned includes all the active code in the lab.php file. If one or   more parameters is missing, the else section  at the bottom of the lab.php file  will request that the user go  back to the lab.html page to properly enter the information.  Do It Adjust the code in the new lab.php file  download it from the book’s web site . Add code to filter for bad  gender code and make sure that gender information has been received from the HTML file. Make sure to  pass your property through the clean_input method to remove any harmful data.  Additional HTML Input Security  As you can see from all the code you have seen in this chapter so far, whenever a text box is used on an  HTML form, additional code in several areas must be included to validate what the user has typed. Text  boxes are necessary when you need to allow the user flexibility in what they can enter  such as a form that  includes name and address . However, you can use other form objects when you want to limit the user’s  response to a particular list of possible values  such as two-letter abbreviations for states . This would  provide more valid data because the user won’t be able to enter a typo or enter invalid data.  123   Chapter 4   SeCured uSer InterfaCeS  HTML5 Select List Box and Radio Buttons One item that you can change from the original HTML file is the entry of the dog breed. The American  Kennel Club currently has over 150 breeds listed on its web site. You can type an option value line for each  breed in the HTML file. However, this would be time consuming. Also, if a breed changed, you will have to  go back and adjust the list. A better option is to place the breeds in a file and then use that file to populate a  select list. If a breed changes or is added, you simply update the one file in one place and all programs that  use it will access the new list automatically. If this file is hosted on the web server, you can also use the same  file in the dog.php code to verify that a correct breed has been passed to the web server from the user.  Example 4-5.  The breeds.xml file       Affenpinscher   Afghan Hound   Airedale Terrier   Akita   Alaskan Malamute   American English Coonhound   American Eskimo Dog   American Foxhound   American Staffordshire Terrier  ...     Security and performance—Providing the user a list of possible values to choose from on an  HTML form provides more validity and security than using text boxes. If the user can only  pick from a list, they cannot choose incorrectly, nor enter invalid or harmful information.  The breeds.xml file contains simple XML code  two tags—breeds and breed  listing all breeds. If you  were creating a true dog breed site, you probably would want to include more information in this file. You  could add more information later without it affecting this program.  You now want to use the XML file  from Example 4-5  to populate a select list box. Since this file will   reside on the server, you need to create a program on the server to call and retrieve the information. You will  assume that this file has been secured on the server for read-only access. You will not attempt to update or  delete any information in the file itself.  You can create a PHP program that will retrieve the information you need with just a few lines of code.  Security and performance—Remember, security is a team effort. Not only does the program  need to be secured, but the web server and its file structure must also be properly secured.  Example 4-6.  The getbreeds.php file  <?php $breed_file = simplexml:load_file "breeds.xml" ; $xmlText = $breed_file->asXML  ; print " "; print " Select a dog breed ";    124   Chapter 4   SeCured uSer InterfaCeS  foreach  $breed_file->children   as $name => $value  { print " $value "; } print " "; ?>  PHP can complete many powerful tasks with just a few lines of code. The first line of Example 4-6 opens   the breeds.xml file, places the contents into a property  $breed_file , and then closes the breeds.xml file.  Skipping to the foreach statement:  foreach  $breed_file->children   as $name => $value   XML data is treated with a parent-child relationship. The parent can contain children  and the children  can have children . In the XML file, the initial parent is breeds. The children that exist under breeds all have  the label breed.   Affenpinscher   example, Affenpinscher .  The value in each breed  child  in this example is the text that exists between the breed tags  for   $breed_file->children   directs the foreach statement to loop through each child  breed in this file .    The as $name=> $value part of the statement tells the system to place each child label name  in this  example it is always breed, but you can have different children  in $name. It also directs the system to place  the value contained in the child  Affenpinscher  in $value.  print " $value ";  Inside the foreach loop, the print statement places the contents of $value in two places—the value   parameter of the option tag and between the option tags. For the first child, it would produce  Option value='Affenpinscher'>Affenpinscher   The foreach loop automatically loops through the file until there are no more records in the file. Similar   lines would be created for each of the breeds in the file. These lines, with the other print lines in the file,  create an HTML select box dynamically from the contents of the XML file.  For more information on the foreach loop, visit  Examples: http:  php.net manual en control-structures.foreach.php  Video: https:  www.thenewboston.com videos.php?cat=11&video=17027  For more information on reading XML files, visit  Video: https:  www.thenewboston.com videos.php?cat=11&video=17090  You need to now call this program from within the HTML file. You can do this using the example  JavaScript file from Chapter 2, which uses AJAX. This will allow you to retrieve the select box by only  updating the section of the page that will display the box. The only line that needs to be changed from the  Chapter 2 example is the line that calls the PHP program.  xmlHttp.open "GET", "get_breeds.php", true ;  125   Chapter 4   SeCured uSer InterfaCeS  You simply replace the existing file name with the program that retrieves the select box  get_breeds.php .   You can then rename the file  get_breeds.js .You could also pass the name of the program you want to run  into the JavaScript method  you will do that later in this chapter .  You now need to make a few changes to the HTML file to use get_breeds.js and to create a div tag for   the area that will hold the select box.  Example 4-7.

The script tag is added near the top of the code to pull in the JavaScript file that contains AJAX to call   the PHP program  get_breeds.php  that will display the select box.    AjaxRequest  ;        A script area has been placed in the JS section of the code  the section that will execute if JavaScript  is enabled in the browser.  It includes just one line  AjaxRequest  ;  to execute the AJAX JavaScript code   from the get_breeds.js file .    is placed below the closing script tag.   This line should look familiar. It is the same line that was included in the Chapter 2 AJAX example. The output  of the AjaxRequest   method places the response that is returned from the web server between the div tags  with the ID of AjaxResponse. In this example, the dynamically created select box is placed in that location.  127   Chapter 4   SeCured uSer InterfaCeS  Figure 4-4.  The lab.html file with dynamic select box and radio buttons  You have also replaced the color text box with a static selection of radio buttons. There are just a few   possible color combinations for dogs  OK, pretend I am right , and these color combinations are not likely to  change, so you don’t need a dynamic list. It makes sense to just hard code the selections in the HTML file.  If the user does not have JavaScript enabled, the original dog breed text box will be displayed  from   the NJ section of the code . However, since you did not use JavaScript to create the radio buttons, you  include the radio buttons in both sections to provide some better secure coding for non-enabled JavaScript  browsers.  The Interface of the program  lab.html  now greatly reduces the possibility of invalid data being   entered by reducing the number of text boxes used. The users  assuming they have JavaScript enabled  have  no choice but to pick a breed from the select box and to pick a color from the radio buttons.  You can also now use the same XML file to validate that you have received a valid breed name from the   users on the server side.  Do It Adjust the lab.html file from Example 4-7 to include radio buttons  instead of a text box  to accept the  gender from the users. Make sure the new lab.html file works with your lab.php file from the previous Do It.  Validating Input with an XML File You can add just a few lines of code in the dog.php file to validate that the user has not only sent a correctly  formatted string, but has also sent a breed listed by the AKC.  128   Chapter 4   SeCured uSer InterfaCeS  Example 4-8.  The validator_breed function  in dog.php   private function validator_breed $value  { $breed_file = simplexml:load_file "breeds.xml" ; $xmlText = $breed_file->asXML  ;   if stristr $xmlText, $value  === FALSE  { return FALSE; } else { return TRUE; } }  You can create a private function  only to be used inside the class  to check on the proper breed. This   function will accept a value passed into the $value property. The function will then use $breed_file =  simplexml:load_file "breeds.xml" ; to dump the contents of the XML file into $breed_file. The next line   $xmlText = $breed_file->asXML  ;  converts the contents of $breed_file into a well formatted string.  if stristr $xmlText, $value  === FALSE   The stristr method compares the contents of its second parameter  in this case $value  to see if it  exists in the string in the first parameter  $xmlText . If it does not exist, it returns FALSE. If it does exist, it  returns the location of the string. For your needs you just need to know if it exists. If it does not, you return  FALSE. If it does, you return TRUE.  For more information on the stristr method, visit  http:  php.net manual en function.stristr.php  Example 4-9.

$this->dog_breed = $value : $error_message = FALSE;  The statement passes $value into validator_breed  $this->validator_breed $value  . If a TRUE   is returned then that part of the if statement would be true. Otherwise it would be false. If the complete if  statement is TRUE then the dog_breed property is set to the breed found in the XML file  $this->dog_breed  = $value . If it is false, then FALSE is passed into the $error_message property  $error_message = FALSE .  Programming note—When you call a function in the same object, you must use the $this  pointer  $this->validator_breed $value  === TRUE  .  You have now completed a program that much more secure. Users cannot enter any invalid   information. The only field they can attempt to do so is in the dog_name field. However, even if they try to  enter program code, or other code, the server-side program will strip out the special characters so the code  becomes harmless. If a packet sniffing program tries to change the data before it is received by the server- side program, the validation and or filtering methods will either cause the data to be rejected or will, again,  make the data harmless.  This program is efficient as it tries to validate the information before it is sent to the server. It reduces   the amount of communication back and forth between the server and the user. The completed program has  two tiers  interface, business rules  and can be expanded to include a third tier  data  without major changes  to the current code.  Programming recommendation—For small web applications that are used infrequently  it is not necessary to break the program apart, as is done in this example. However, as  mentioned, if it is an application that might expand in the future, or might gain significant  users in the future, the program should initially be created with this in mind, by breaking  the program into tiers.  134   Chapter 4   SeCured uSer InterfaCeS  Do It Go to the book’s web site and run the example program. See if you can “break” the security built into the  program. Remember, you can only attempt to be as secure as possible, nothing is 100% secure. Were you  able to send harmful information to the program that affected the program? If so, what did you do? What  might be missing from the program that allowed this to happen? If not, what stopped your harmful data from  corrupting the program? What changes might you make to this program that would require you to include a  data tier? What inefficiencies still exist in the program? What can you do to fix them?  Dependency Injection  As you have seen, when programs are created, a developer goes through many iterations before the final  application has been completed. Along the way, experience programmers will keep different versions of  their programs. This allows the programmers to back up to a previous version, quickly, if the version they  are working on has too many significant problems. Otherwise, they would have to attempt to strip out the  “bad” code without doing harm to the good code. Applications have many files  HTML, JavaScript, CSS, PHP  classes, and PHP libraries . Keeping track of which version works with which, or easily changing one part of  the program to use a new version of another part, can become confusing. Especially when the file names and  class names are coded in the code of the program itself.  Chapter 2 briefly discussed dependency injection. It allows the program  client  that will use a block of  code  such as a class  to not know the actual implementation of the block of code it will be using. The client  program does not know the actual class name.  You can use this idea to help the development process. The example you are about to look at is not   for large-scale applications. However, it does give you a chance to look at the benefits of dependency  injection. Large-scale applications should use a MVC  Model-View-Control  model or an established tier  or  component  system that provides more efficient communication between components.  Security  and  performance—Many  times  there  is  a  trade-off  between  being  as  secure  as  possible and having a program that has the best performance possible. The example that  follows will make multiple system calls when it checks to see if a program exists and then  uses require_once to load the program. The check for file existence allows the program to  handle missing files rather than the program just crashing. In a later chapter, you will look  at using try catch blocks to allow the program to capture any problems without crashing  the program. This would reduce the number of system calls  you would no longer need to  check for the existence of the files , giving the program better performance.  The dog application uses classes and methods contained in different files. This requires the code to also   include require_once statements to pull the files into the program. The current design places the actual  file name in the require_once statement. This does not allow you to change different versions of the files,  unless you change the code. You will now remove these dependencies to provide more flexibility for future  development of the application.  Before you get too bogged down with the code, Figure 4-5 shows the flow of the relationship with the   programs.  135   Chapter 4   SeCured uSer InterfaCeS  Figure 4-5.  Data flow for the dog application  The dog_interface.php program will provide the interface for all parts of the dog application. In   addition it provides security and filtering as you have already designed in the previous examples. Along  with these other activities, dog_interface creates and uses the dog_container object to contain, create,  and pass any other objects needed  without knowing the name of the objects . The dog_container object  uses an XML file  not shown  to discover the location and name of files containing the classes it will create   providing dependency injection .  The application will always use the dog_interface program to access the other classes. The dog_interface   program will determine what classes are needed to accomplish a particular task. Whenever a class is needed,  the dog_interface will use the dog_container to determine the name and location of the class  via the XML  file , and to create an instance of the class  object . By using an XML file to list the class file names and locations,  changes can be made without causing any code changes to programs in the application.  When the breed select box is requested from the lab.html page, the dog_interface program is called.  It will create a dog_container object. The dog_container object will discover the location and file name of  the get_breeds class file and the breeds XML file. Once it is discovered, the dog_container object will create  a get_breeds object. The get_breeds object will then build the code for the select box; eventually returning  the code to the form in lab.html for display to the user. All objects  dog_container and get_breeds  are  then destroyed  removed from memory .  When the Submit button is clicked on the lab.html form  assuming all validation is passed , it will call  the dog_interface program. This program will create the dog_container object. The dog_container object  will then discover the location and file name of the dog.php class file. Once discovered, the dog_container  object will create the dog object. The dog object will behave exactly as it has in previous examples  validating  properties and displaying properties . Once the dog object has completed, the objects  dog_container  and dog  are destroyed  removed from memory . This design allows complete independence of the objects  providing both two-tier design  interface and business rules  and dependency injection.  Example 4-10.  The dog_applications.xml file           dog3.php           get_breeds2.php       136   Chapter 4   SeCured uSer InterfaCeS       breeds.xml         In Example 4-10, you have created a simple XML file that will be used for version changes of the   significant files in the PHP application. Each application tag identifies the type of file  dog, select box,  breeds . Each location tag within the application tag provides the file name and location  although in  this example you have all files in the same location . Once you adjust the program to use this file, you will  have the flexibility to change the file names  such as the example using dog3.php instead of dog.php  and  the location without having to change any program code. This can help you to swap versions in out of the  application during the development process.  You will now create a Dog_container class that will contain two methods. get_dog_application will be   used to “fetch” the name and location of any of the files listed in the XML file. The create_object method will  create an instance of either the dog class or the get_breeds class.  Example 4-11.  The dog_container.php file  <?php class Dog_container { private $app; private $dog_location; function __construct $value  { if  function_exists 'clean_input'   { $this->app = $value; } else { exit; } } public function set_app $value  { $this->app = $value; } public function get_dog_application   { $xmlDoc = new DOMDocument  ; if   file_exists "dog_applications.xml"    { $xmlDoc->load  'dog_applications.xml'  ; $searchNode = $xmlDoc->getElementsByTagName  "type"  ; foreach  $searchNode as $searchNode   {     $valueID = $searchNode->getAttribute 'ID' ;     if $valueID == $this->app   137   Chapter 4   SeCured uSer InterfaCeS      {     $xmlLocation = $searchNode->getElementsByTagName  "location"  ;     return $xmlLocation->item 0 ->nodeValue;     break;     } } }     return FALSE; } function create_object $properties_array  {   $dog_loc = $this->get_dog_application  ;   if  $dog_loc == FALSE    !file_exists $dog_loc      {     return FALSE;   }   else   {     require_once $dog_loc ;     $class_array = get_declared_classes  ;         $last_position = count $class_array  - 1;         $class_name = $class_array[$last_position];         $dog_object = new $class_name $properties_array ;                   return $dog_object;         } } } ?>  First, at the top of the class  dog_container , you declare two private properties—$app and    $dog_location. These properties are declared as private, instead of public, to keep their values only   known within this class.  In the constructor, $value accepts a name of an application type that you want to find in the XML   file  such as selectbox . Later in the code, you will compare $value to the type ID in the XML file to see if  you can find the application type and a file associated with it. The constructor places $value into the $app  property. However, the method also includes an if statement that uses the method function_exists to  determine if the clean_input function exists.  Why? At the beginning of the chapter, you briefly looked at code that allowed you to restrict the use of a  program to a specific application that has called it. In this example, you look at another technique to restrict  which programs can use this class. The if statement demands that any program that makes an instance of  this class must also have a clean_input method. If someone tries to make an instance of the program using  another program that does not already contain a clean_input method, the else part of the statement will  execute, which will cause the object not to be created and will close the program.  Security  and  performance—Any  time  a  program  is  accepting  information  from  the  Internet, or across a network, it is a good idea to determine the source of the information.  In addition to determining application and function names, PHP programs can also look  at the source IP addresses.  138   Chapter 4   SeCured uSer InterfaCeS  public function get_dog_application   { $xmlDoc = new DOMDocument  ; if   file_exists "dog_applications.xml"    { $xmlDoc->load  'dog_applications.xml'  ; $searchNode = $xmlDoc->getElementsByTagName  "type"  ;  The first part of the get_dog_application method should look familiar. This code opens the    dog_applications.xml file  after making sure it exists . Then it loads the contents into $xmlDoc. The last line  calls the PHP method getElementsByTagName. This method searches for all occurrences of “type” in $xmlDoc  and places each occurrence in $searchNode.  foreach  $searchNode as $searchNode   {     $valueID = $searchNode->getAttribute 'ID' ;     if $valueID == $this->app      {     $xmlLocation = $searchNode->getElementsByTagName  "location"  ;     return $xmlLocation->item 0 ->nodeValue;     break;     } }  The foreach loop looks at each line contained in $searchNode. It uses the PHP method getAttribute   to place the next line with an ID XML attribute into the property $valueID. Once it is placed in $valueID, the  value in this property  dog, selectbox, or breeds  is compared to $this->app.  The property app was loaded  with a value in the constructor.  If the ID is found in the XML file, getElementsByTagName will search for the  next line that contains a location XML tag. The return line then takes the value in the location tag  the file  name and its location  and returns it to the program that called this method. The break statement is used to  break out of the loop early because you have already returned the value needed in the previous line of code.  The else part of the method  shown in Example 4-11  will return FALSE if the XML file does not exist.  function create_object $properties_array   The create_object method is used to create the dog and get_breeds objects. The dog object   constructor was expecting four values  dog_name, dog_weight, dog_breed, and dog_color  in its  constructor. The get_breeds app was not accepting any values in its constructor. In order to provide more  efficient code in dog_container, you change the signature of the constructor  the top line of the function  of  each class to accept an array, instead of individual values. This will allow you to pass any number of items  into either constructor.  function __construct $properties_array  {    dog class constructor if  method_exists 'dog_container', 'create_object'   { $name_error = $this->set_dog_name $properties_array[0]  == TRUE ? 'TRUE,' : 'FALSE,'; $breed_error = $this->set_dog_breed $properties_array[1]  == TRUE ? 'TRUE,' : 'FALSE,'; $color_error = $this->set_dog_color $properties_array[2]  == TRUE ? 'TRUE,' : 'FALSE,'; $weight_error= $this->set_dog_weight $properties_array[3]  == TRUE ? 'TRUE' : 'FALSE';  139   Chapter 4   SeCured uSer InterfaCeS  This requires changing these lines in the dog.php file to accept an array and then use the values in the   array to set each property.  Notice that $properties_array in the first line does not have anything that declares it as an array    except the name . Remember that PHP properties determine what data type they are by what is passed in  the property. The same is true with arrays. If an array is passed into $properties_array, it becomes an array.  The address of the array is passed into the method. The property that accepts the address    $properties_array  actually points to the location of the array in memory. This is very efficient. If you  needed to pass 50 items into a method, you could pass them all one at a time with different properties  declared in the methods signature for each of these 50 items. However, instead, you can create an array  that holds the 50 items and pass the array. You are only passing one value using this approach, which is the  address of the array in memory. Also, as noted with this example, using an array allows you to be flexible in  the amount of items you want to pass into a method signature.  $name_error = $this->set_dog_name $properties_array[0]  == TRUE ? 'TRUE,' : 'FALSE,';  To copy an item from an array, you refer to the item using the array’s name  $properties_array  and   the position that the item exists in the array  [0] . Notice that you use [] brackets for declaring the position.  The position is commonly called the subscript. Arrays subscripts begin with position 0, not position 1.  class GetBreeds { function __construct $properties_array  {   get_breeds constructor if  ! method_exists 'dog_container', 'create_object'    { exit; } }  You must adjust the get_breeds program. GetBreeds is now a class. You also create the signature of the   GetBreeds constructor to accept an array. However, as you can see from this code, you actually will ignore  anything that is passed into the array. This allows you to use the same method in dog_container to create  an object of either class  or actually of any class that accepts an array . All you need to find is the name of the  class  dog or GetBreeds  so you can make an instance of it.  The create_object method then calls the get_dog_application method and places the value returned    the location of the file and file name  into $dog_loc. If the value in $dog_loc is FALSE or is not an existing  file, the method returns FALSE to the program that called it.  function create_object $properties_array  {   $dog_loc = $this->get_dog_application  ;   if  $dog_loc == FALSE    !file_exists $dog_loc      {     return FALSE;   }  else   {     require_once $dog_loc ;     $class_array = get_declared_classes  ;         $last_position = count $class_array  - 1;  140   Chapter 4   SeCured uSer InterfaCeS          $class_name = $class_array[$last_position];         $dog_object = new $class_name $properties_array ;         return $dog_object;         } } } ?>  If the path and file name are valid, the else portion of the code will execute. The value in $dog_loc is   used in the require_once statement  which pulls the contents of the file into this method .  You must now determine the name of the class that exists in the file  dependence injection requires you   to not only discover the file names and file path, but also the class names .  The PHP method get_declared_classes returns an array of all the classes that currently exist in the   program. The classes are in order from first to last. Thus, since you just included the file with a class  either  the dog or get_breeds class , you can hunt for the last entry in the array created. You have placed the array  created by get_declared_classes in $class_array. You can now determine the size of the array. The PHP  method count will return the size of an array. Remember the size of an array is the number of items in the  array not the last position. If an array has a size of ten, the actual subscripts are 0 through 9, not 1 through 10.  $last_position = count $class_array  - 1;  For more information on get_declared_classes, visit http:  php.net manual en function.get-declared-classes.php  With this in mind, this statement determines the size of $class_array and then subtracts 1 from the   size and places that value in $last_position. Thus, if the array had a size of 10, the number 9 would be  stored in $last_position  since the array subscripts would be 0 through 9, not 10 .  $class_name = $class_array[$last_position];  You can then use the value in $last_position to pull the last class created from the array and place  it into $class_name. As you can see, you can actually pass the property $last_position between the []  subscript brackets to indicate to the program you want the value of whatever is in the position located in  $last_position. This allows you to be able to pull the information from the last position in any size array   since you have no idea of the size of the $class_array .  You can now create an instance of the class, because you have the class name in $class_name.  $dog_object = new $class_name $properties_array ;  This line of code will now create an instance of any class  that accepts an array into the constructor  that   has just been included  require_once  in the program. The method will create an instance of either the dog  class or getBreeds class.  return $dog_object;  Finally, the object  which is either a dog object or a getBreeds object  is returned to the program that  called the method. By returning the object, the calling program has complete access to the object and its  properties and methods, even though it did not actually create the object  dog_interface can use the object  even though dog_container created it .  141   Chapter 4   SeCured uSer InterfaCeS  The object’s location in memory is returned in a similar way as the array’s location was passed into the  constructor in the previous example. You can think of it as the new object is temporarily “contained” within  the dog_container object. However, the object is returned  to dog_interface .  Programming  note—What?  What  really  happens  is  that  the  address  in  memory  of  the    $dog_object  is  passed  to  the  calling  program   dog_interface .  This  allows  the  calling  program to have access to the object, along with the $dog_container object. Thus, there is only  one copy of the $dog_object in memory but two different program blocks can use it. If one of  the blocks  dog_container or dog_interface  closes, the other object still has access to it, until  it also closes. Then the garbage collector will remove the $dog_object from memory.  Example 4-12.  The get_breeds class  <?php class GetBreeds { function __construct $properties_array  {   get_breeds constructor if  ! method_exists 'dog_container', 'create_object'    { exit;}} private $result = "??"; public function get_select $dog_app  { if   $dog_app != FALSE  &&   file_exists $dog_app    {      $breed_file = simplexml:load_file $dog_app ;      $xmlText = $breed_file->asXML  ;      $this->result = " ";      $this->result = $this->result . " Select a dog breed ";     foreach  $breed_file->children   as $name => $value      {    $this->result = $this->result . " $value ";  }       $this->result = $this->result . " ";              return $this->result;     } else {              return FALSE;     } } } ?>  As you can see from Example 4-12, only minor changes were needed. As mentioned, a class was   declared and a constructor was added. The constructor verifies that this class was created from a program  that contains both the dog_container and create_breed_app methods. This security attempts to keep  other programs from knowing that the file names and locations for the Dog application that reside in the  dog_application.xml file.  Example 4-13.  The dog_interface.php file  <?php function clean_input $value  { $bad_chars = array  "{", "}", " ", " ", ";", ":", " ", " ", "$"  ; $value = str_ireplace $bad_chars,"",$value ;  $value = htmlentities $value ; $value = strip_tags $value ;  142   Chapter 4   SeCured uSer InterfaCeS          if  get_magic_quotes_gpc            { $value = stripslashes $value ; } $value = htmlentities $value ; return $value; } function error_check_dog_app $lab  { list $name_error, $breed_error, $color_error, $weight_error  = explode ',', $lab ; print $name_error == 'TRUE' ?

None of the methods from lab.php have changed.  if   file_exists "dog_container.php"   {  require_once "dog_container.php" ; }  else { print "System Error 1"; exit; } if  isset $_POST['dog_app']    First the program determines if the dog_container exists by using the PHP file_exists method. If it  does, it pulls the code into the program using require_once. If dog_container does not exist, the program  prints an error message  "System Error 1"  and then closes  exit; .  Next, the program uses isset to determine if a value for $dog_app has been provided by the calling   program. If this value has been passed, it is an indication that the calling program wants to create a Dog object.  $container = new dog_container clean_input $_POST['dog_app']  ; $dog_name = clean_input filter_input INPUT_POST, "dog_name"  ; $dog_breed = clean_input $_POST['dog_breed'] ; $dog_color = clean_input $_POST['dog_color'] ; $dog_weight = clean_input $_POST['dog_weight'] ; $properties_array = array $dog_name,$dog_breed,$dog_color,$dog_weight ;      $lab = $container->create_object $properties_array ;          if  $lab != FALSE           {      error_check_dog_app $lab ;      get_dog_app_properties $lab ;  144   Chapter 4   SeCured uSer InterfaCeS           } else {          print "System Error 2";          } else { print " Missing or invalid parameters. Please go back to the lab.html page to enter valid  information. "; print " Dog Creation Page "; } }  The program then creates an instance of dog_container  $container  that passes the value in $dog_app   into the $container object. Each of the properties of the Dog object are filtered using the clean_input  method. Then the properties are passed into the $properties_array array. The array is then passed  into the create_object method of the dog_container object  $container . If the Dog object  $lab  is  created successfully then the error_check_dog_app method is called to verify that each property has valid  information. The get_dog_app_properties method is called to display each property.  If any of the properties needed for the Dog object are missing, the user is requested to return to the    lab.html page to re-enter the required information.  else {   get breeds      $container = new dog_container "selectbox" ;      $properties_array = array "selectbox" ;      $lab = $container->create_object $properties_array ; if  $lab != FALSE           {       $container->set_app "breeds" ;       $dog_app = $container->get_dog_application  ;       $method_array = get_class_methods $lab ;        $last_position = count $method_array  - 1;        $method_name = $method_array[$last_position];        $result = $lab->$method_name $dog_app ;           if   $result == FALSE     select box not created           {             print "System Error 3";           }           else           {              print $result;    select box created!            }          }          else          {          print "System Error 4";          }  If the $dog_app value is not passed in to the class, the else statement is executed. It is assumed that   the user wants to create a getBreeds object. An instance of the dog_container is created  $container  and  it passes the value selectbox.  If the object can’t be created, "System Error 4" will display . The words  “selectbox” are passed into the array $properties_array  Note: The array keyword must be used or you  would be creating a property not an array.  The container object  $container  will then call the create_object   passing the $properties_array to create an instance of the getBreeds class  $lab . If the getBreeds object  is successfully created  $lab !=FALSE  you then need to find the location of the get_breeds.xml file  which   145   Chapter 4   SeCured uSer InterfaCeS  contains the list of breeds . So you reset the app property  by calling set_app  in the container to “breeds”.  This tells the container program you are a getBreeds object, not a dog object. You then use the   get_dog_application method of the container to find the location of the breeds XML file.  For more information on arrays, visit  Examples: http:  php.net manual en function.array.php  Videos: https:  www.thenewboston.com videos.php?cat=11&video=17024  The PHP method get_class_methods is used to create an array of methods contained in getBreeds.   Since the get_select method is the only method  besides the constructor , it is also the last method in the  array. Its name is pulled from the array and then it is called using the property $method_name  $result =  $dog_data->$method_name $dog_app   . This allows the getBreed class to be completely independent of the  dog_interface. The developer can change the name of the get_select method and everything would still  work  as long as it’s the last method in the class . This provides a complete split between the interface tier  and the business rules tier.  The location of the XML file is passed into the get_select method of the getBreeds object  $lab ,   which uses the XML file for the data to create the select list box. The code for the select list box is dropped  into $result. If the code did get dropped into $result, the code is displayed  print $result  back into the  HTML form for the user to select a breed. If the file name was not valid, an error message  print "System  Error 3"  will display instead of the select box.  The only other changes required are two slight changes to the lab.html and get_breeds.js files.  function AjaxRequest $value   In the get_breed.js file, the function header for the AjaxRequest method has been changed to pass   the actual file being called  this was not a requirement of this design, but it allows this file to be used for any  program that is called via AJAX .  xmlHttp.open "GET", $value, true ;  In addition, the open statement has been adjusted to use $value instead of a file name. In the lab.html program, there are a couple of additional changes.  AjaxRequest 'dog_interface.php' ;  The call to the JavaScript function now passes the file name, which has also been changed to the    dog_interface.php file.     Finally, the action tag  in both form tag locations  for the HTML form has been changed to call the   dog_interface.php program.  Notice that now, whenever you want to use the Dog application you call the interface first. Then the   interface determines what you want to accomplish  get the breeds select box or process the properties for  the dog you are creating .  You must communicate to all of your classes through the interface. The interface, in turn must create   any required objects by using the container  except, of course, for the container itself . This follows the  concepts of tier design.  146   You will not see any different output than previously seen  unless you have some system errors .   However, now you can easily change file names and locations  via the XML file  in the application without  changing any program code!  Chapter 4   SeCured uSer InterfaCeS  Do It    1.  Download the files for this section from the book’s web site. Change the file   names for the get_breeds.xml file, the get_breeds.php file, and the dog.php file.  Try to run the program via the lab.html file. The select box will not display and  the program will not run. Now go to the dog_applications.xml file and change  the data in the XML file to the new file names you just created. Go back to your  lab.html file  reload it . You should now see the select box. Fill in and select the  information and click the Submit button. The application should now work.

After the information is validated it is passed to the business rules tier.  The business rules tier will validate the information received and filter out any  harmful information. Once the information is accepted  and stored in   the properties  the application will display all fields of the product stored in the  warehouse of the ABC Computer Parts Company. The interface tier and the  business rules tier must be separated using dependency injection  via an XML  file , as shown. Your completed project should use logic similar to the examples  shown in this chapter.  151   Chapter 5  Handling and Logging Exceptions  “The education of a man is never completed until he dies.” —Robert E. Lee  As quoted in  Peter's Quotations: Ideas for Our Time  1977  by Laurence J. Peter, p. 175   Chapter Objectives Student Learning Outcomes  After completing this chapter, the student will be able to:  Explain the difference between errors and exceptions   	  	 Create a PHP program that can handle general exceptions  	 Create a PHP program that can create, raise, and handle user exceptions  	 Explain and use a switch and or embedded if else statement  	 Create a PHP program that uses the while loop and or for loop  	 Create a program that reads updates a text file using a two-dimensional array  	 Create a PHP program that logs exceptions and e-mails support personnel  Handling Exceptions  As a programmer, you want to do everything possible to ensure that your program will not crash. Anyone  using your application will get a bad taste in their mouths if they have to deal with system crashes. You have  probably dealt with this situation too. As a user, you may have chosen one application over another because  of bad reviews. Once an application has been determined to be “buggy,” it’s difficult to convince customers  to use the product, even if newer versions have corrected some or all of the problems. An application must  be created to handle every possible unanticipated event.  A program must look at each scenario and decide if it can continue or if it must shut down. There will   always be a possibility that the application cannot continue to operate due to an unexpected event. Properly  developed programs will let the user know that there is a problem without the program crashing. Users are  more likely to understand when an application asks them to “try again later”  assuming the problem is fixed  before they return to the web site .  Electronic supplementary material  The online version of this chapter  doi:10.1007 978-1-4842-1730-6_5   contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.    Steve Prettyman 2015  S. Prettyman, Learn PHP 7, DOI 10.1007 978-1-4842-1730-6_5  153   Chapter 5   handling and logging exCeptions  Errors are program events that are handled by the system that cause the program to shut down. In some  cases, the system can shut down the program and display an error message. Some errors immediately cause  the program to crash  such as the server itself crashing . Errors are usually events beyond the control of the  program and not directly caused by code  or lack of code  in the program. For example, insufficient memory  will cause application errors.  Exceptions are events that are not part of the normal flow of the program logic. All exceptions should be  handled by the program. Exceptions can be “raised” when the application anticipates a problem  a missing  file  or when the user does something out of the ordinary  tries to enter invalid information . The program  should “catch” all the exceptions. It can then examine the exception and determine if it can be corrected,  ignored, or if the application must shut down. If a program does not catch exceptions, the system will display  the exception message and then shut down the application.  PHP produces a mixture of errors and exceptions depending on the circumstances. Before PHP 5,   exception handling did not exist. Thus, some older PHP commands produced errors  which shut down the  program  instead of exceptions. In PHP 7 exception handling is the “rule”. PHP 7 Errors can be handled with  exception handling techniques. If exceptions are not handled with program code, the program will halt as if  it were a fatal error.  Any time an application is dependent on something external, it is probable that at some point that action   will not take place. For example, in the Dog application, the user is expected to enter the proper information.  The application must anticipate that not all users will enter correct information. The application is also  dependent on several files existing on server  dog_interface, dog_container, dog_applications, and   get_breeds . If any of these files are missing, the application cannot continue to function properly.  Most object-oriented programming languages use a standard format for handing exceptions. The  current version of PHP also uses this approach. As you explore PHP examples on the Internet, you will  discover existing PHP code that does not use this standard format. While this code will still execute in the  current version of PHP, it is recommend that the standard techniques be used. The standard approach uses  the try-catch block.  Any code that could cause an exception should be included in the try block. In addition, you may also   want to consider placing other conditions  such as math calculations  in the try block.  try {    code that might cause an exception } catch Exception $e  {    code that executes if there is an exception } catch Error $e  {    PHP 7+ capture and handle errors }  try { $result = $firstNumber   $secondNumber; } catch Exception $e  {    code that executes if there is an exception } catch Error $e  {    PHP 7+ capture and handle errors }  154   Chapter 5   handling and logging exCeptions  This example might produce an exceptiwon if $secondNumber contains a zero  dividing by zero . If the   exception occurs, the code would jump to the catch block. Any code in the block will then be executed.  The statement $e->getMessage  ; will display any system message related to the exception  in this case a  message about the attempt to divide by zero . However, you do not have to use the system message; you can  use echo or print to display messages to the users.  try { $result = $firstNumber  $secondNumber; } catch Exception $e  { echo "You entered zero for the second number. Your entry must be greater than zero"; }  However, there is a problem with these examples. If you were trying to catch more than one type of   exception in the try block, all exceptions would go into the one catch block. Any exception would display  the same message. There are a couple of different ways you can handle this.  One way is by throwing your own exception instead of having the system throw it.  try {         if  $secondNumber == 0  { throw new Exception "Zero Exception" ; } else { $result = $firstnumber   $secondnumber; }    other code with exceptions } catch Exception $e  {         switch  $e->getMessage    {                 case "Zero Exception":                         echo "The value of second number must be greater than zero";                         break;                 case "Some other exception":                         echo "You did something else wrong";                         break;                 default:                         echo $e->getMessage  ; }  Programming note—In addition to getMessage method, the Exception and Error objects  include: getCode  —Displays the code causing the exception getFile  —Displays the file name containing code that threw the exception getLine  —Displays the line number that threw the exception getTrace    and  getTraceAsString  —Displays  backtrace   exception  flow  through  the  program  information In some circumstances it might be appropriate to display the Exception or Error message  to the users. However, the other methods should only be used for debugging or log entries.  Providing code information to the users is usually unnecessary and is a breach of security.  155   Chapter 5   handling and logging exCeptions  In this example, a switch statement was used in the catch block to look at all possible exception   messages. A switch statement accomplishes the same task as an embedded if statement. You could have  used:  If $e->getMessage == "Zero Exception"  { echo "The value of second number must be greater than zero"; } else if $e->getMessage == "Some other exception"  { echo "You did something else wrong"; } else { echo $e->getMessage  ; }  For some, the switch statement is easier to understand when looking at multiple possible values for the  same property  variable  or the result of executing a method  as in this example . The default section of the  switch statement  or the last else statement in the embedded if statement  catches anything you did not  anticipate. In this example, you simply display the exception message for other exceptions.  As stated earlier, it’s very important that you handle all exceptions and errors. By including the default   code you are able to handle exceptions and errors you may have never anticipated. Notice that each case  section must include a break as the last statement. This keeps the code from following through into the next  case statement.  Catch Exception $e  {         switch $e->getMessage    {                 case "Zero Exception":                         echo "The value of second number must be greater than zero";                 case "Some other exception":                         echo "You did something else wrong";                         break;                 default:                         echo $e->getMessage  :         }  In this example, if the Zero Exception occurred, both of the messages  "The value of the second  number must be greater than zero" and "You did something else wrong"  would be displayed. The  use of the switch statement is very common in catch blocks. However, as stated earlier, you can use the  embedded if statement if you prefer.  Another way you can handle multiple exceptions is to create your own exceptions, throw them, and   then catch them. You will need to create a class for your own exception.  class zeroException extends Exception {    public function errorMessage   {          $errorMessage = "Second Number cannot be " . $this->getMessage  ;          return $errorMessage;          }  } try { if  $secondNumber == 0  { throw new zeroException "Zero" ; } else  156   Chapter 5   handling and logging exCeptions  { $result = $firstnumber   $secondnumber; }    other code with exceptions } catch zeroException $e  {         echo $e->errorMessage  ; } catch Exception $e  {         Echo $e->getMessage  ; }  The zeroException class extends the class Exception. The extends keyword is used to inherit all of the  functionality of the Exception class. Inheritance is another key component of object-oriented programming   along with encapsulation and polymorphism . A child class  like zeroException  can inherit all the  properties and methods of its parent class  Exception . The child class then can add methods  such as the  function errorMessage  specific to the class. Since zeroException inherited Exception, it is treated the  same as any other exception. The zeroException can be thrown  throw new zeroException "Zero"   and  it can be caught  catch zeroException $e  .  Program  note—Programmer-created  exception  classes  inherit  from  Exception.  Thus,  all  the functionality of the Exception class is available from within any new exception class.  Class zeroException extends Exception { }  The previous code creates a valid new zeroException class with no new methods.  catch zeroException $e  { echo $e->getMessage  ; }  This catch block will be called by the new exception and display the exception message  generated by the Exception class.  For each exception or error class that is created and thrown, there must be a catch block to catch the   exception or error. In the example, there are two catch blocks; one catches the zeroException and the other  catches any other exceptions that might occur. Just like the previous example using a switch default or if  else statement, you should always have the last catch blocks handle any remaining exceptions or errors. If  the generic catch block is listed first, all exceptions would be caught by that block and not the specific block  for the exception.  As stated, the developer should make every attempt to keep the application from crashing. Errors,   however, are designed to display messages and shut down programs with an error code  what you consider  to be “crashing” the program . Before PHP 7, in some cases, you could override this functionality by creating  a method that will handle errors.  function errorHandler $severity, $message, $file, $line  {     throw new errorException $message, 0, $severity, $file, $line ; } set_error_handler 'errorHandler' ;    set_error_handler   doesn't work with all fatal errors, some can’t be thrown as Exceptions. try { trigger_error  "User Error", E_USER_ERROR ;   } catch errorException $e  { echo $e->getMessage  ; } catch Exception $e  { echo $e->getMessage  ; }    Code placed here would execute after an error with this handler. It would not execute if    there was not a handler.  157   Chapter 5   handling and logging exCeptions  In this example, the set_error_handler method redirects all errors  that can be redirected  to the   method errorHandler. When the method trigger_error causes E_USER_ERROR to occur, the handling of the  error is redirected to the errorHandler method. This method then gathers the information from the error  to throw an exception  errorException . The exception is captured by the catch errorException $e   method, which causes the message "User Error" to be displayed.  In PHP 7, the Error object captures potential system errors as exceptions.  try { call_method null ;    no such method! } catch  Error $e  { echo $e->getMessage; }  Previously, the call to a non-existent function would cause a fatal error. Using the EngineException  object allows the programmer to handle the error. The example shown previously  before PHP 7  would  only capture some errors; this new technique is designed to allow the programmer much more control over  errors. If this catch block is not included, any “error” would cause the program to crash with the "Fatal  error: Uncaught exception" message.  If you have PHP 7 installed, use the new Error object along with the Exception object to avoid fatal   errors whenever possible.  Security and performance—Usually the use of throwing and catching exceptions can reduce the  amount of code needed in a program. However, there is a trade-off. Several studies of different  object-oriented program languages have concluded that exception handling is less efficient   performance  than using developer created routines. The developer should use exceptions  as  true  “exceptions”  to  the  normal  flow  of  the  application.  For  more  frequently  occurring  situations, the developer should create situation handling routines in the application.  Figure 5-1.  Data flow for the dog application  In the Dog application, the information flows between many different programs. Each of these programs   must be able to handle exceptions properly. However, message handling should all occur in the interface.  Any objects that are part of the business rules tier  dog_container, dog, and get_breeds  should pass any  exception messages to the interface to handle. At first this may sound like a complex and confusing task.  However, the hierarchy of exception handling will greatly simplify this task. As you are about to see, using  exception handling will reduce the amount of code necessary.  When exceptions are thrown, the environment will look in the program  or class  itself to determine if   there is a catch block that can handle the exception. If there is not a catch block, it will go up one level in  the hierarchy and check any calling program  or program that has made an instance of the class  for a catch   158   Chapter 5   handling and logging exCeptions  block. This process will continue until either a catch block has been discovered or it has been determined  that the environment itself must handle the exception.  Using this process, you can throw exceptions in the dog_container, dog, and get_breeds modules   without using catches. In the dog_interface, you can create a try block around calls to these files. Multiple  catch blocks  or one with a switch statement  could be created in the interface to handle the exceptions  from both the interface and all the other modules. This satisfies one of the requirements of three-tier  programming. The business rules tier  and data tier  pass messages to the interface tier. The interface tier  then determines how to handle those messages. It could display them to the users, place them in a log file   which you will look at later in this chapter , or ignore them  if it does not adversely affect the operation of  the application .  Before you change the Dog application code, let’s look at an example of exceptions being handled by   the hierarchy.  Example 5-1.  testerror.php with error and exception-producing methods  <?php class testerror {    function produceerror   {        trigger_error  "User Error", E_USER_ERROR ;        echo "This line will not display";  }    function throwexception   {        throw new userException "User Exception" ;        echo "This line will not display";  }  } ?>  Example 5-2.  The handleerror.php file captures error or exception  <?php function errorHandler $severity, $message, $file, $line  {             throw new errorException $message, 0, $severity, $file, $line ;    } class userException extends Exception { } Set_error_handler ‘errorHandler’ ; try { require_once “testerror.php” ; $tester = new testerror  ; $tester->produceerror  ; echo “This line does not display”; $tester->throwexception  ;    will not execute if produceerror   is executed echo “This line does not display”; } catch  errorException $e  {            echo $e->getMessage  ; } catch  userException $e  {   echo $e->getMessage  ; } catch  Exception $e  {            echo $e->getMessage  ; } echo “This line will display”; ?>  159   Chapter 5   handling and logging exCeptions  The testerror class  in Example 5-1  includes a method to cause an error  produceerror  and a   method that throws an exception  throwexception . However, the class does not have try or catch blocks.  It does not have the ability to react to any exceptions or errors that might occur.  The handleerror program  in Example 5-2  includes a method that will handle user errors     errorHandler , along with the set_error_handler command to redirect errors to this method. It also  includes a class  userException  that can react when the userException exception is thrown in the try  block. The require_once statement is included in the try block in an attempt to capture the error if the file  is missing. However, this happens to be a system error  not a user error  which cannot be redirected. To  capture system errors in PHP 7, the Error class must be used within a catch block as previously shown.  After the require_once statement, an instance of class testerror is created. If this class is missing, the   system will also error with a fatal message. The block calls the produceerror method, which causes a user  error. This error is redirected to the errorHandler, which throws an exception  errorException . The catch  block receives the exception and displays the error message. Since exceptions do not shut down the program   like fatal errors , the flow of the program jumps to the first line after all the catch blocks and executes the  echo statement  echo "This line will display"; . The reaction to the error will cause the program to skip  any remaining code in the try block. In this example, the throwexception method call would be ignored. If the $tester->produceerror   line is commented out, the throwexception method call can take   place. The userException is thrown in the method. The userException class inherits the Exception class.  No special methods have been included in userException. The flow of the program will jump to the catch  block for userException. This block uses the Exception class getMessage method to display the message.  The logic then jumps to the first line of code after the catch blocks and executes the echo "This line will  display" statement.  Program  note—try catch  can  also  include  a  finally  block  after  all  catch  blocks.  The  finally block will execute for all caught exceptions after the associated catch block has  executed. PHP allows the finally block to exist without any catch blocks  but the try block  must still exist . One of the most common uses of the finally block is to close files and or  databases when an exception has occurred. A program should not close before files and  databases have been properly closed. If not closed properly, the data may become corrupt  and not be accessible.  1.  Go to the book’s web site and download the files for Examples 5-1 and 5-2.  Adjust the testerror program to only create an error. Create an additional  testexception program  with a testexception class  to throw an exception.  Now adjust the handleerror program to create an instance of both programs.  The handleerror program should now be able to handle errors or exceptions  from either program  class .  Exception and Error Handling vs. If Else Conditions  A programmer can always choose to handle exceptions and errors using If else conditional statements as  shown in the dog application files from Chapter 4. It is not any less efficient to handle errors in this way  it  might even be more efficient . However, as you are about to discover, the attitude of the code in the business  rules tier  and data tier  changes if you use exception handling. When you use if else statements, the flow  of the program spends a lot of time being pessimistic by preparing for the worst  errors and or exceptions .  In many cases, by using exception handling, the coding for most of the business rules tier  and data tier   becomes optimistic including code which handles the normal operation of the program. The application  relies on the interface tier to handle any problems.  Do It    160   Chapter 5   handling and logging exCeptions  Example 5-3.  The dog.class with exception handling  <?php class Dog {    ------------------------------------ Properties ----------------------------------------- private $dog_weight = 0; private $dog_breed = "no breed"; private $dog_color = "no color"; private $dog_name = "no name"; private $error_message = "??"; private $breedxml = "";    ------------------------------------ Constructor ---------------------------------------- function __construct $properties_array  {   if  method_exists 'dog_container', 'create_object'   {   $this->breedxml = $properties_array[4];   $name_error = $this->set_dog_name $properties_array[0]  == TRUE ? 'TRUE,' : 'FALSE,';   $color_error = $this->set_dog_color $properties_array[2]  == TRUE ? 'TRUE,' : 'FALSE,';   $weight_error= $this->set_dog_weight $properties_array[3]  == TRUE ? 'TRUE' : 'FALSE';   $breed_error = $this->set_dog_breed $properties_array[1]  == TRUE ? 'TRUE,' : 'FALSE,';   $this->error_message = $name_error . $breed_error . $color_error . $weight_error;   if stristr $this->error_message, 'FALSE'     {         throw new setException $this->error_message ;   } }     else { exit; } }   function set_dog_name $value  {   $error_message = TRUE;     ctype_alpha $value  && strlen $value   dog_name = $value : $this->error_  message = FALSE;    return $this->error_message; } function set_dog_weight $value  {   $error_message = TRUE;     ctype_digit $value  &&  $value > 0 && $value  dog_weight = $value :   $this->error_message = FALSE;   return $this->error_message; } function set_dog_breed $value  {   $error_message = TRUE;     $this->validator_breed $value  === TRUE  ? $this->dog_breed = $value : $this->error_  message = FALSE;    return $this->error_message; } function set_dog_color $value  {   $error_message = TRUE;     ctype_alpha $value  && strlen $value   dog_color = $value : $this->error_  message = FALSE;    return $this->error_message; }  161   Chapter 5   handling and logging exCeptions     ----------------------------------Get Methods-------------------------------------------- function get_dog_name   {   return $this->dog_name; } function get_dog_weight   {   return $this->dog_weight; } function get_dog_breed   {   return $this->dog_breed; } function get_dog_color   {   return $this->dog_color; } function get_properties   {   return "$this->dog_name,$this->dog_weight,$this->dog_breed,$this->dog_color."; }    ----------------------------------General Method-----------------------------------------   private function validator_breed $value    {     $breed_file = simplexml:load_file $this->breedxml ;     $xmlText = $breed_file->asXML  ;     if stristr $xmlText, $value  === FALSE    {     return FALSE;   }   else     {       return TRUE;     }   } } ?>  Comparing Example 4-8 to Example 5-3, you will notice only a couple of slight changes to the code.   The __toString method has been removed and replaced by an if statement that checks to see if FALSE  exists anywhere in the error_message string. If it does exist, a setException message is raised, passing  the error_message string to the exception handler. This causes a logical change in the flow of the overall  application. Instead of the dog_interface program  in Example 4-12  checking for user entry errors by  calling the __toString method, the Dog class notifies the dog_interface  via a thrown exception  when  user errors occur. Previously the interface had to pull the errors from the Dog class. In this example, the Dog  class pushes the errors to the interface class. As you will see, this will eliminate code from the dog_interface  program, since it no longer has to ask if there are any errors.  Security and performance—The __toString method “exposes” whatever it returns to any  program that makes an instance of the class in which it exists. Using this method to pass  error messages might allow a hacker to determine what incorrect information  they  are  sending into a program. In the dog.class example from Chapter 4, __toString passes back  the error_message string containing 'TRUE' or 'FALSE' responses. This is more secure than  returning error messages. However, by replacing the __toString method with throwing a  special exception, you provide even better security. Hackers must now not only know what  the error_message means, but they must also know the name of the exception  setException   in order to capture it in their own programs.  162   Chapter 5   handling and logging exCeptions  Example 5-4.  The getbreeds.class with exception handling  <?php class GetBreeds {    function __construct $properties_array  {         if  ! method_exists 'dog_container', 'create_object'               { exit; }    }      private $result = "??";   public function get_select $dog_app    {             if   $dog_app != FALSE  &&   file_exists $dog_app                {                 $breed_file = simplexml:load_file $dog_app ;                 $xmlText = $breed_file->asXML  ;                 $this->result = " ";                   $this->result = $this->result . " Select a dog   breed ";                   foreach  $breed_file->children   as $name => $value                   {                       $this->result = $this->result . " $value ";                  }                  $this->result = $this->result . " ";                   return $this->result;             }             else             {                    throw new Exception "Breed xml file missing or corrupt" ;             }     } } ?>  Comparing the previous GetBreeds class  in Example 4-11  with Example 5-4 shows only one change.  It returns 'FALSE' and throws a general exception indicating that the breed.xml file is missing or corrupt.  Again, the GetBreeds class pushes any exceptions to the interface. The interface no longer has to determine  if there are any exceptions. Even though missing file errors cannot be redirected to be handled as exceptions,  the code uses file_exists to throw an exception if the file is missing.  Example 5-5.  The dog_container.php file with exception handling  <?php class dog_container {   private $app;   private $dog_location;   function __construct $value  {       if  function_exists 'clean_input'   {           $this->app = $value;        } else { exit; }    }  163   Chapter 5   handling and logging exCeptions     public function set_app $value  {       $this->app = $value; } public function get_dog_application $search_value  {      $xmlDoc = new DOMDocument  ;      if   file_exists "e5dog_applications.xml"    {          $xmlDoc->load  'e5dog_applications.xml'  ;          $searchNode = $xmlDoc->getElementsByTagName  "type"  ;          foreach  $searchNode as $searchNode    {               $valueID = $searchNode->getAttribute 'ID' ;               if $valueID == $search_value    {                     $xmlLocation = $searchNode->getElementsByTagName  "location"  ;                      return $xmlLocation->item 0 ->nodeValue;               break;    }   } }     throw new Exception "Dog applications xml file missing or corrupt" ; }   function create_object $properties_array  {       $dog_loc = $this->get_dog_application $this->app ;       if  $dog_loc == FALSE    !file_exists $dog_loc    {           throw new Exception "File $dog_loc missing or corrupt." ;  }    else     {        require_once $dog_loc ;        $class_array = get_declared_classes  ;        $last_position = count $class_array  - 1;        $class_name = $class_array[$last_position];        $dog_object = new $class_name $properties_array ;        return $dog_object;    }  } } ?>  The dog_container in Example 5-5 replaces returning 'FALSE' from Example 4-10 when the    dog_application.xml file, dog.class file, and or the get_breeds file is missing. Instead, an exception is  thrown indicating which file is missing.  Example 5-6.  The dog_interface.php file with exception handling  <?php   function clean_input $value   {     $value = htmlentities $value ;     $value = strip_tags $value ;     if  get_magic_quotes_gpc         {           $value = stripslashes $value ;      }       $value = htmlentities $value ;       $bad_chars = array  "{", "}", " ", " ", ";", ":", " ", " ", "$"  ;       $value = str_ireplace $bad_chars,"",$value ;       return $value;   }   164   Chapter 5   handling and logging exCeptions   class setException extends Exception {     public function errorMessage   {           list $name_error, $breed_error, $color_error, $weight_error  = explode ',',    $this->getMessage   ;           $name_error   == 'TRUE' ? $eMessage = '' : $eMessage = 'Name update not successful ';          $breed_error  == 'TRUE' ? $eMessage .= '' : $eMessage .= 'Breed update not successful ';          $color_error  == 'TRUE' ? $eMessage .= '' : $eMessage .= 'Color update not successful ';          $weight_error == 'TRUE' ? $eMessage .= '' : $eMessage .= 'Weight update not successful ';          return $eMessage;      }  } function get_dog_app_properties $lab  { print "Your dog's name is " . $lab->get_dog_name   .

The logical flow of the program is easier to follow with very few  else statements. This occurs because the exceptions thrown from all the files in this application are handled  by the catch blocks in dog_interface. The user errors are thrown to a special setException exception. The  system errors are captured by the Error catch block. The error_check_dog_app method  in Example 4-12   has been replaced by the setException class. The code in the class is very similar to the code in the error_ check_dog_app. The display of individual update messages in the $eMessage string is removed, since this  class reacts to user errors, not successful updates. A general print line has been added in the main body of  the code to let the users know that all updates have been successful. The try block has been added around  all the code in this interface. This helps to capture any problems in any part of this application. Notice that  an exception is also thrown if the dog_container file cannot be found.  Only three catch blocks are required for this application. The setException catch block calls the   errorMessage method from the setException class, which determines what user errors have occurred. The  information is then displayed back to the user. The Exception catch block handles all other exceptions. It  currently displays this information to the user. However, the Exception and Error catch blocks are currently  providing the user too much information. It is a violation of security to inform the user what other problems  the application maybe experiencing. You should just tell them that the system is not currently available and  ask them to check back later. Displaying detailed errors is okay when you’re testing. However, it’s not good  for the real world. You will resolve this breach of security in the next section.  For more information on exception handling, visit Examples: http:  www.w3schools.com php php_exception.asp Video: https:  www.thenewboston.com videos.php?cat=11&video=17171  166   Chapter 5   handling and logging exCeptions  Do It    1.  Examine the code from this section. Are there any areas in which error checking  could have been converted to exception handling? Go to the book’s web site and  download the code for this section. Make the potential changes to the existing  code to use additional exception handling.  Logging Exceptions  Applications must have an ability to notify systems analysts when problems occur. However, specific  messages about errors should not be displayed to the user of the application. The user should be notified  that the system is not currently operational. The systems analyst should be notified of the specific problem  that has occurred.  The easiest way to provide this ability is to place error messages into a log file. PHP applications can log  messages into the default PHP error file or in an application specific file. The php.ini file can be edited  see  Chapter 1 for location  to specify the location and name of the default error log file. Once the php.ini file is  open in an editor, search for error_log. If a semicolon is located at the beginning of the line, the location has  been commented out. Just remove the semicolon and specify a location, such as:  error_log = c: temp php_errors.log -or- error_log = http:  www.asite.com temp php_errors.log  When writing to the default error log, PHP will insert a timestamp along with the error message that you   submit. Your default time zone may not be set correctly in the php.ini file. Search for date.timezone. The  valid time zone settings for the continental United States are:  date.timezone = "America New_York" date.timezone = "America Chicago" date.timezone = "America Los_Angeles" For all other American time zones visit: http:  www.php.net manual en timezones.america.php For worldwide time zones visit: http:  php.net manual en timezones.php  The Apache httpd config file  see Chapter 1 for location  can override the settings in the php.ini file.  You should also open this file and search for date.timezone. Replace the existing line with a format similar  to the following.  php_value date.timezone "America New_York"  Once you have updated and saved the php.ini and or apache.httpd files, you must reload your   Apache server for the changes to take place  see Chapter 1 .   the time zone can also be set with program code. php 7 does not support the datefmt_set_     Note  timezone_id method. the datefmt_set_timezone method can be used for php 5.2+. For more information on  setting the time zone with program code, visit http:  php.net manual en datetime.settimezone.php.  167   Chapter 5   handling and logging exCeptions  <?php error_log "error message" ; ?>  Enter this code and save it in a test file. Test it in your environment. If your settings are correct, PHP   will create the error log at the location specified in the error_log parameter. Don’t create the file yourself.  PHP will not log information to a log file that it did not create. The format of the message sent to your log file  should be similar to the following:  [25-Jun-2015 17:01:12 America New_York] error message  With only the simple one line of code, PHP created the text-based file in the location specified and   placed the message in the file.  If you do not have access to these files, you can specify a specific location in the PHP application to   send your messages. This ability also allows you to set up multiple application log files. It is common for an  application to have informational log files, authentication  login  log files, error log files, and security log  files. By separating each type of message, it’s easier to scan for a specific type of message in a log file.  Let’s assume you want to log user errors in one file and other errors in a different file.  <?php const USER_ERROR_LOG = 'User_Errors.log'; const ERROR_LOG = 'Errors.log';    sending a user error error_log "A user error",3,USER_ERROR_LOG ;    sending all other errors error_log "A general error",3,ERROR_LOG ; <?php  This code will use the constants  USER_ERROR_LOG and ERROR_LOG  to direct the error messages to  the correct location. Notice that a second parameter of 3 is used to let the error_log method know that  a different location will be used to log the error. A standard format should be used for sending messages  to your log s . The format should include the time date  if not already included by the environment as  mentioned previously , the type of message  if there is more than one message type in the file , the error  message, and any other pertinent information. By default, the message size is limited to 120 characters.  However this can be changed in the php.ini file.  $date = date 'm.d.Y h:i:s' ;    For more info on data time format go to: http:  php.net manual en function.date.php $errormessage = "This is the error"; $eMessage =  $date . "  User Error  " . $errormessage . "\n"; error_log $eMessage,3,USER_ERROR_LOG ; The above code would produce 06.06.2015 03:00:55  User Error  This is the error  A standard text editor  Notepad++ or Notepad  or log-monitoring software  you will create a log reader   program later in this chapter  can be used to view the contents of the file.  168   The system will limit the size of the log file s . However, assuming that there is not too much logging per   day, the application can create logs that are specific for each day.  Chapter 5   handling and logging exCeptions  $USER_ERROR_LOG = "User_Errors" . date 'mdy'  . ".log"; $ERROR_LOG = "Errors" . date 'mdy'  . ".log"; ... error_log $eMessage,3,$USER_ERROR_LOG ;  Security and performance—The location of the log files should reside in a different folder  than  the  application.  The  folder  will  need  to  allow  write  access  for  the  application.  However,  it  should  be  secured  from  read  access  or  write  access  outside  the  server  itself.  Only authorized personnel should have access to the logs.  Note that the constants  USER_ERROR_LOG and ERROR_LOG  must be changed to variables due to the date  method creating a possible variable output  different dates . The format would create a file name similar to  User_Errors06062015.log or Errors06062015.log.  PHP also makes it very easy to send an e-mail alert when something has been written to a log file. The   webserver must include an e-mail server. Your local machine may not have this capability. However, usually,  a web host provider  that has PHP capability  includes an e-mail service. To use this ability, you can add an  error_log statement:  error_log "Date Time: $date - Serious System Problems with Dog Application. Check error log  for details", 1, "noone@helpme.com", "Subject: Dog Application Error \nFrom: System Log   " . "\r\n" ;  Security and performance – While it is tempting to inform the associate receiving the e-mail  message  of  the  exact  problem  that  has  occurred  in  the  application,  do  not.  By  default,  e-mail is not encrypted. Sending an unencrypted e-mail with detailed information about  your  application  is  inviting  hackers  to  corrupt  your  application.  You  should,  however,  provide enough information in the message  such as a date time stamp and maybe an  error number  to help the associate locate the error message s  in the log file s .  The first parameter specifies the message of the e-mail. The second parameter informs error_log to  e-mail this information. The third parameter provides the “To” e-mail address. The fourth parameter is an  extra header field. This field is commonly used to include the subject of the e-mail and the e-mail address  that sent the message. The “From” address must be included or the message will not be sent. The “From”  address does not, however, need to be an existing address.  For more information on logging errors, visit Examples: http:  php.net manual en function.error-log.php Examples: http:  www.w3schools.com php php_error.asp  In the Dog application, you can provide the ability to log exceptions and e-mail major errors by adjusting   the catch blocks of the dog_interface  from Example 5-6 .  169   Chapter 5   handling and logging exCeptions  Example 5-7.

Locating constants that might be subject to change  such as a  tax rate  at the top of the code provides easy access for quick changes by a programmer who is charged with  supporting the application. As stated previously, the location of the log file must be in a folder that allows  application write access. It is recommended that log files be centrally located in a common folder, with other  log files, for easy access by data center personnel  or systems analysts .  The other code changes are located in the catch blocks. The setException catch block returns the  error message generated by the setException class to the users. This message lets the users know what  properties  Name, Breed, Color, and Weight  were not updated. Errors that caused this exception could have  come from the user, or by corruption when the information was transmitted from the client machine to the  server. These messages only provides information about the requirements of the properties, which the user  already should have known. The catch block also writes a similar message to the user error log. A user error  is not an urgent error that needs to be addressed by the analyst. However, tracking trends of user problems  can provide an indication of possible changes needed to ensure the user has the best experience possible  with the application.  The  Exception and Error catch blocks captures all non-user generated exceptions. The messages   caused by these exceptions might reveal information that would break the security of the application.  Therefore a generic message  such as "The system is currently unavailable. Please try again  later."  should be displayed to the user. Detailed information about the exception  error message, file  location, coding line that raised the exception  should be placed in the error log for further analysis. Most  exceptions caught by these catch blocks will keep the application from running. Therefore, it is important  that personnel be informed of the problems occurring. This catch blocks are a good location to send an  e-mail to the support personnel to alert them of any problems.  Now that you have built-in exception handling and error handling into the program, you could edit the  php.ini file to turn off error reporting to the user. However, you should wait to do this until all development  and testing has been completed. Locate the line "display_errors = On" in the php.ini file. If you change  this setting to "display_errors = Off", most error messages will not be displayed to the user. This change  will not affect any messages sent back by the program to the user via the echo or print methods  including  in any catch blocks . This change will give the developer greater control over the type of messages displayed  to the users when there are system problems.  Do It    1.  Download the code for this section. Create or use an existing HTML page   that does not check for user input errors. Run the program entering values for  the name, breed, weight, and color, which should cause user errors. Stop the  program and open the contents of the user error log file. Did the errors appear in  the file? If not, check the security of the folder that contains the log file to make  sure that it allows write access to the log file. Once you are satisfied that it has  caught user errors, try to cause other system errors to occur. Hint: Change the  file names to nonexistent names in the dog application XML file. Check the error  log to determine if the errors have been written to the file. Were you able to cause  any errors that are not captured by one of the log files? If so, is there a way to  capture those errors?  173   In the previous section, you discovered that the error_log method writes to a log file using just one line of  code. It creates the log file if it does not exist. It appends  adds to the end of the file  any message passed to  the contents of the file. It then closes the file. If you were to create your own logging process, it would take  several lines of code.  Chapter 5   handling and logging exCeptions  Reading Log and Text Files  $logFile = fopen "error_log.log", "a" ; $eMessage = $e->getMessage  ; fwrite $logFile, $eMessage ; fclose $logFile ;  The fopen method will also create the file if it does not already exist. The “a” parameter indicates that   anything written to the file should be appended. “w” would indicate that any contents in the file would  be lost  written over . The fwrite method will then place the string located in the second parameter   $eMessage  into the file indicated by the first parameter  $logFile . $logFile is a pointer that points to the  location of the text file. The fclose method closes the text file.  For more information on writing to text files, visit Examples: visit w3schools at: http:  www.w3schools.com php php_file_create.asp Video: visit “The New Boston” at https:  www.thenewboston.com videos.php?cat=11&video=17063  Since a log file is a text-based file, you can use similar logic to create your own application to open a log   This code will open the log file and read the first line  via a fgets method  in the file and close the file.  However, it is likely that there is more than one line in the file. You must be able to loop through and display  each line in the file. You can do this using the while loop shown here.  file and read its contents.  $logFile = fopen "error_log.log", "r" ; echo fgets $logFile ; fclose $logFile ;  $logFile = fopen "error_log.log", "r" ; while !feof $logFile   {           echo fgets $logFile  . " "; } fclose $logFile ;  The while loop will continue to loop as long as the conditional statement is TRUE. Once the statement is  FALSE, the code will exit the loop and jump to the next line of code after the end of the loop. In this example  the error_log file is open for read only  “r” . The while loop looks at the end of file indicator  feof  of the  log file to determine if it has reached the end of the file. If feof returns TRUE, the end of the file has been  reached. The loop must continue while you have not reached the end of the file. To cause the conditional  statement to produce a TRUE, while there are still records to be read, you must reverse the logic and have  feof produce TRUE if there are records and FALSE if there are not records. You can do this by using the !  operator. The ! operator is a NOT operator and it reverses the result. A NOT TRUE is FALSE or a NOT FALSE is   174   TRUE. Thus, !feof operator will now produce TRUE when there are more records and FALSE when there are  no more records. The loop in combination with the fgets method will display each record in the file. Once  each record is displayed, it will close the file using fclose.

You can use  a combination of an HTML table, the explode method, and arrays to produce a much better output. You  can place each line from the log file into a two-dimensional array using the explode method. The two- dimensional array will have rows and columns just like the HTML table.  $dogs = array       array "Sammy","Lab",18,"Yellow" ,   array "Spot","Mixed",14,"Mixed" ,   array "Princess","Chihuahua",4,"White" ,   array "Max","Boxer",35,"Brown"     ;  Two-dimensional arrays are a collection of rows of information. Each row has common information in  each position  column . In the previous example, all dog names are in position 0, dog breeds are in position  1, dog weights are in position 2, and dog colors are in position 3. This associates directly with the positions   in a table.  For more information on the multi-dimensional arrays, visit: examples: http:  www.w3schools.com php php_arrays_multi.asp videos:  https:  www.thenewboston.com videos.php?cat=11&video=17026  Sammy Spot Princess  Max  Lab Mixed Chihuahua  Boxer  18 14 4  35  Yellow Mixed White  Brown  175   Chapter 5   handling and logging exCeptions  Each position in the table and the two-dimensional array is referred to by the column and row. In this   table, Sammy is in position  0,0 . Yellow is in position  0,3 . Max is in position  3,0 . Brown in in position   3,3 . The first position is the column. The second position is the row. In PHP, [] are used to define the  position  subscript  for an array.  echo $dogs[0][0]    displays Sammy echo $dogs[0][3]    displays Yellow echo $dogs[3][0]    displays Max echo $dogs[3][3]    displays Brown  You can now adjust the loop to place the log contents in a two-dimensional array. However, you will not  know the size of the array. So you can’t use the format previously shown. This might cause developers to get  a major migraine if they were not using PHP. PHP, however, allows you to dynamically create the array, just  like it allows you to create variables  properties  whenever you need them.  $logFile = fopen "error_log.log", "r" ; $row_Count = 0; while !feof $logFile   {           print_r  $error_Array[$row_Count] = explode '  ', fgets $logFile   ;   $row_Count++;  } fclose $logFile ;  In the loop in this example, the explode method breaks the incoming line from the text file via the    character  actually a space, , and a space . It places each separated string into the $error_Array at the row  indicated by the value in $row_Count. The first time through the loop, the first line of the log file is placed  in $error_Array[0]  the first row of the array . Because the explode command separated the string, this  causes columns to be created for each piece.  If the first line of the file contained:  A general error  stuff  more stuff  then the first row of the array would contain:  $error_Array[0][0] = "A general error" $error_Array[0][1] = "stuff"; $error_Array[0][2] = "more stuff";  You can verify this by using the print_r command shown in the example. print_r displays the contents   of an array in the following format.  Array   [0] => A general error [1] => stuff [2] => more stuff    This format verifies that each piece of the string has been placed into the proper position in the array. $row_count is incremented by 1 before the loop continues. This positions the next line of the file to be   placed into the next position in the array  $error_Array[1], if it is the second line of the file . You, of course,  don’t want to use print_r to display the results to the users  it’s not very pretty .  However, it is a great tool to help you make sure the program is placing everything properly in the array.   You can add code to the loop to build a table.  176   Chapter 5   handling and logging exCeptions  $logFile = fopen "Errors.log", "r" ; $row_Count = 0; echo " "; while !feof $logFile   {        echo " ";          $error_Array[$row_Count] = explode '  ', fgets $logFile  ;          $displayString = "";          for $I=0; $I < 3; $I++                       {          echo "  " . $error_Array[$row_Count][$I] . "   ";  }             echo " ";             $row_Count++; } echo " "; fclose $logFile ;  An echo statement is located just before the while loop to open the HTML table. An additional echo   statement  echo " "  exists just inside the while loop to create a row of the table.  For more information on the for loop, visit: Examples: http:  www.w3schools.com php php_looping_for.asp Videos: https:  www.thenewboston.com videos.php?cat=11&video=17013  Also in the while loop, a for loop has been created to loop through each of the columns of the row.   Since you know that there are four columns, the for loop is a good choice. The for loop is used when you  know exactly how many times to loop. The first parameter  before the ;  of the for loop initializes the  counting variable  $I=0 . This variable  $I  is used to count each loop. The second parameter  $I < 3   includes the comparison to determine if the logical flow will stay in the loop. If the comparison is TRUE,  the loop will continue. If it is FALSE, the logical flow jumps to the first statement after the loop  echo " " .  The third parameter  $I++  can increment or decrement the counting variable. The for loop helps the  programmer to remember to initialize the variable, check the condition, and increment the variable by  requiring all the information in one code line.  The echo statement in the for loop uses the $row_Count and $I variables to pull the information from   each column in the current row. The first time in the loop, $row_Count will be 0. The echo statement will  display the contents of $errorArray[0][0]. As the for loop continues, the contents of $errorArray[0][1],  $errorArray[0][2], and $errorArray[0][3] will be displayed. Each value is placed into a cell in the table  using the   and   tags. Once the for loop completes, the flow drops below the loop and closes the row   echo   . Then the row_Count variable is incremented. If there are more rows  more records in the file ,  the while loop will continue the process with the next row, until there are no more records in the file. Once  the flow jumps out of the while loop, the table is closed  echo " " . Then the file is closed.  Text  log  files are sequential files. As items are added  appended , they are added to the bottom of the   list. You may want to sort the information, listing the most current first. This can be accomplished with just a  slight change to the code.  177   Chapter 5   handling and logging exCeptions  $logFile = fopen "Errors.log", "r" ; $row_Count = 0; while !feof $logFile   {         $error_Array[$row_Count] = explode '  ', fgets $logFile  ;         $row_Count++; } $row_Count--; fclose $logFile ; echo " "; for  $J=$row_Count; $J >= 0; $J--  {         echo " ";         $displayString = "";         for $I=0; $I < 3; $I++          {                echo "  " . $error_Array[$J][$I] . "   ";         }         echo " "; } echo " ";  The while loop now loads the array with the records and keeps a count of the number of items in the  array. After the loop ends and the file has been closed, a for loop works through the array in reverse order  to echo out the rows in the table. The counter variable $J begins with the total number of rows in the array   $row_Count . One is subtracted from $row_Count before the loop because it is incremented in the while  loop after the last record has been retrieved, which makes the count one too many. $J is then decremented   $J--  for each loop until the value is less than zero. The internal for loop  for $I=0;$I<3;$I++   has not  changed, as it must still loop through each column of the rows to display the information.  By loading the records into an array, you can modify them if needed. Let’s assume that you want to  be able to delete a record from the log. As long as you know the row number that is to be deleted you can  remove that record from the array. Then you can repopulate the file with the remaining records.  First you will make a slight change to the echo code you have completed to include a link next to the   record to be deleted. You then will add a delete method, move the display code to a display method  so it  can be called whenever needed , and create a save changes method to update the log file.  Example 5-8.  The readerrorlog.php file  <?php   function deleteRecord $recordNumber, &$row_Count, &$error_Array  {         for  $J=$recordNumber; $J < $row_Count - 1; $J++  {                 for $I=0; $I < 3; $I++                  { $error_Array[$J][$I] = $error_Array[$J + 1][$I]; } }           Unset $error_Array[$row_Count] ;         $row_Count--;         } function saveChanges $row_Count,$error_Array,$log_File  {         $logFile = fopen $log_File, "w" ;  178   Chapter 5   handling and logging exCeptions          for $I=0; $I < $row_Count; $I++  {                  $writeString = $error_Array[$I][0] . "  " . $error_Array[$I][1] . "  " .   $error_Array[$I][2];                  fwrite $logFile, $writeString ;         }         fclose $logFile ; } function displayRecords $row_Count, $error_Array  { echo "  "; echo "  table { border: 2px solid 5c744d;}   "; echo "   "; echo " Log File: " .

"   ";                 }         echo " "; } echo " "; echo "  "; }    main section   const ERROR_LOG = "Errors.log";   $logFile = fopen ERROR_LOG, "r" ; $row_Count = 0; while !feof $logFile   {             $error_Array[$row_Count] = explode '  ', fgets $logFile  ;             $row_Count++; } fclose $logFile ;   if isset $_GET['rn']   {               deleteRecord $_GET['rn'], $row_Count, $error_Array ;             saveChanges $row_Count,$error_Array,ERROR_LOG ; }   displayRecords $row_Count,$error_Array ;   ?>  179   Chapter 5   handling and logging exCeptions  Figure 5-2.  The readerrorlog.php file with user errors  In Example 5-8, the displayRecords method contains most of the same code previously shown. Extra  CSS code has been added to make the display a little more professional. Also, an HTML href link has been  included with each record displayed. The link recalls the program, passing the record number that the user  wants to delete.  The set of code in the “main section”  the first lines of code that execute  creates a constant ERROR_LOG   to define the location and name of the log file. The file is opened and loaded into the array in the same  manner as shown previously.  Once the array is loaded, the program checks to see if it has been called by one of the delete links for  each record. If a value has been passed via HTTP GET, the program then calls the deleteRecord method.  Once the deleteRecord method is complete, the program calls the saveChanges method. Whether or not a value  has been passed into the program, it executes the last statement, which calls the displayRecords method.  the   line  of   Program  note—The  header   function  deleteRecord $recordNumber, &$row_Count, &$error_Array   uses by reference, instead of  by value, to allow $row_Count and $error_Array to be updated in the method. By default,  parameters  passed  into  a  method  cannot  be  changed  by  the  method   by  value .  The  &  indicates that the parameter is passed by reference. This allows the value to be changed.  deleteRecords can adjust the count of the number of rows in the array  $row_Count  and the  information in the array itself  $error_Array .  deleteRecords  method   By value passes the contents  data  that is contained in the parameter into the method. By  reference passes the memory address of the parameter into the method, which allows the  method to change the value of the parameter in memory.  The deleteRecords method accepts the record number to be deleted as one of its parameters. Any   position in the array above this record number is unchanged. Any position below this record must be shifted  up one position. For example, if an array has ten positions  0-9  and the fifth position  4  is to be deleted,  then positions 5-9 must now become positions 4-8.  In the following example, position $J+1 is placed into position J for any record after the $recordNumber   to be deleted:  180   Chapter 5   handling and logging exCeptions  The last position in the array is no longer needed. The last position of the array is released  using   unset . This will inform the operating system that the space is memory is no longer needed. The operating  system will call its garbage collector to free up the memory location. We will discover an easier way  to accomplish this task when we discuss associative arrays in a later chapter. Once the array has been  reconfigured, the saveChanges method is called to replace the records in the log file. The code shown is very  similar to previous examples in this chapter, with one exception. The fopen method uses the parameter  “w”. The “w” parameter will erase anything that is already in the file and replace it with what is currently  being written to the file. In this example the file will be updated  replaced  with the new set of records that  excludes the record that was deleted. The displayRecords method is called anytime the program is called   with or without a record being deleted . This method displays the contents of the log file.  Programming note—Programs that retrieve data that will be used throughout the program  usually  retrieve  the  information  in  the  initial  stages  of  the  code  and  place  it  in  a  data  structure  array, list,or dataset . As the data is updated in the program, the information  in  the  data  structure  is  updated.  When  the  data  processing  has  been  completed,  the  information is then returned to the original location  text file or database . Updating the text  file or database is usually completed as one of the final stages of the program. The process  of a user logging out of a program would provide an event to indicate that the updated  data should be saved.  181   Chapter 5   handling and logging exCeptions  Do It    1.

I  don’t  know  where  I’m  going,  but  I’m  on  my  way.”  —Carl  Sandburg,  Incidentals  1904   Chapter Objectives Student Learning Outcomes  After completing this chapter, the student will be able to:  Explain how to create a data class that updates MySQL data using a SQL script   	 Create a data class that inserts, updates, and deletes XML or JSON data  	  	 Create a PHP program that creates a change backup log  	 Create a PHP program that can recover data from a previous backup  	  	 Use dependency injection to attach a data class to another class in the BR tier  	 Create a three-tier PHP application  Apply changes to create up-to-date valid information  The Data Class  The interface and business rules tiers should not store application information. These tiers should not  even be aware of how the information is stored  text file, XML, or database  or the location of the stored  information. Any information that is stored must be passed from the business rules tier to the data tier. The  data tier is also responsible for reacting to requests for information from the business rules tier.  This allows the interface tier and business rules tier to be unaware of any changes in types of storage   methods  text file, XML, or database  and the locations of stored items. The signature  parameters accepted   and items returned from the data tier should remain unchanged over the life of the application. As long as  these do not change, there should be no changes needed in the other tiers when changes occur in the data tier.  Security and performance—When using databases it may seem logical to build a SQL string in   the business rules tier and pass the string to the data tier. This would cause a major security hole in the  application. Hackers could pass any SQL string  including a delete string . It may also seem logical to pass  SQL update commands  DELETE, UPDATE, and INSERT  into the data tier. Again this provides a major hole.  Passing data for a WHERE SQL command is also a bad idea as it might allow hackers to delete or change any  combination of data in the database.  Electronic supplementary material  The online version of this chapter  doi:10.1007 978-1-4842-1730-6_6   contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.    Steve Prettyman 2015  S. Prettyman, Learn PHP 7, DOI 10.1007 978-1-4842-1730-6_6  187   Chapter 6   Data ObjeCts  A data class should provide complete functionality for manipulating information. This includes the  ability to read, insert, update, and delete information. Even if the current application does not require all  these commands, logically, they should exist in the data class for future use.  A balance should be achieved between performance and the requirement to store information. While highly  important information might require immediate storage, other information can be held in a data structure  list,  array, and dataset  in the application until the user has completed any updates. Holding and making changes  to information in the memory of the server, instead of the storage location, is much more efficient. Storing the  information only after all changes have been completed will reduce several calls to the storage location down to  two  initial retrieval of the information and saving of the updated information . Making changes to information  in memory is always more efficient than making changes on a storage device  such as a hard drive .  Using a data class provides a logical ability to populate a data structure and to save information in a   storage location automatically. Assuming that an instance of the data class will only be created when it  is necessary to update information, the constructor of the class can be used to retrieve the information  from storage and place it in the memory of the server. When the data object is no longer needed, logically,  no more changes are required to the information. The destructor of the class can be used to return the  information from memory to storage.  class dog_data {         function __construct           {                  $xmlfile = file_get_contents get_dog_application "datastorage"  ;                  $xmlstring = simplexml:load_string $xmlfile ;                  $array =  array $xmlstring;                  print_r $array ;         } }  This example constructor comes very close to providing useful information from an XML file. The   PHP file_get_contents method opens a text file, drops the contents into a string, and closes the file. The  constructor calls this method along with the get_dog_application method  same method that was used in  dog_container in Example 5-5  to determine the file name and location of the XML data file. The contents  of the file are then placed in $xmlfile. The PHP simplexml:load_string method then formats the data to  allow the SimpleXML data model to traverse the information. At this point, the SimpleXML methods could  be used to display and manipulate the data. However, the next line attempts to convert the XML data into an  array. The  array  statement tries to use type casting. The print_r statement displays the results.         Woff   12   Yellow   Lab       Sam   10   Brown   Lab       188   Chapter 6   Data ObjeCts  Assuming that the XML file is formatted as shown here, the output includes:  Array   [dog] => Array   [0] => SimpleXMLElement Object   [dog_name] => Woff [dog_weight] => 12 [dog_color] => Yellow [dog_breed] => Lab   [1] => SimpleXMLElement Object   [dog_name] => Sam [dog_weight] => 10 [dog_color] => Brown [dog_breed] => Lab        A combination of multidimensional arrays and SimpleXML objects have been created. This does not  provide useful data that can easily be manipulated. However, you can use JSON methods to trick PHP into  creating a multidimensional associate array.  class dog_data {         function __construct           {                  $xmlfile = file_get_contents get_dog_application "datastorage"  ;                  $xmlstring = simplexml:load_string $xmlfile ;                  $json = json_encode $xmlstring ;                  print_r $json ;         } } {"dog":[{"dog_name":"Woff","dog_weight":"12","dog_color":"Yellow","dog_breed":"Lab"},{"dog_name" :"Sam","dog_weight":"10","dog_color":"Brown","dog_breed":"Lab"}]}  Using the PHP json_encode method changes the data into well-structured JSON data. You could   use one of the several PHP techniques to manipulate JSON data or, with one additional statement  json_ decode , you can create a well-structured multidimensional associate array.  class dog_data {         function __construct           {                  $xmlfile = file_get_contents get_dog_application "datastorage"  ;                  $xmlstring = simplexml:load_string $xmlfile ;                  $json = json_encode $xmlstring ;                  $dogs_array = json_decode $json,TRUE ;                  print_r $dogs_array ;         } } Array   [dog] => Array   [0] => Array   [dog_name] => Woff [dog_weight] => 12 [dog_color] => Yellow [dog_breed] => Lab   [1] => Array   [dog_name] => Sam [dog_weight] => 10 [dog_color] => Brown [dog_breed] => Lab        As you can see, there is no longer a mixture of arrays and SimpleXML objects. An associate array has   been created that uses keywords instead of numerical values for subscripts  indexes . In the previous  example, an array called "dog" has been created with two rows  each row is represented by an array . In  each row, the columns  cells  are referenced by a column name  dog_name, dog_weight, dog_color, and  dog_breed  instead of indexes  0, 1, 2, 3 . These rows and columns can be manipulated using some of the  techniques you have seen in previous chapters.  189   Chapter 6   Data ObjeCts  Once you have completed all changes to the array  as requested by the business rules tier , you will   return the information to the storage location in the destructor.  private $dogs_array = array  ;    defined as an empty array initially function __construct           {                $xmlfile = file_get_contents get_dog_application "datastorage"  ;                $xmlstring = simplexml:load_string $xmlfile ;                $json = json_encode $xmlstring ;                $this->dogs_array = json_decode $json,TRUE ;         } function __destruct   {             $xmlstring = ' ';             $xmlstring .= "\n \n";             foreach  $this->dogs_array as $dogs=>$dogs_value  {                 foreach  $dogs_value as $dog => $dog_value                  {                         $xmlstring .=" \n";                         foreach  $dog_value as $column => $column_value                          {                         $xmlstring .= " " . $dog_value[$column] . " \n";                         }                         $xmlstring .= " \n";                 }     } $xmlstring .= " \n";  file_put_contents get_dog_application "datastorage" ,$xmlstring ; }  There are many ways that you can create XML data in PHP. The previous example takes a simplistic   approach by supplying the XML tags from the array. As seen in the structure, there are three sets of arrays in  this multidimensional array. The first foreach loop is used to flow through the first array  dogs . The second  foreach loop handles the dog arrays  rows . Once inside this loop, the third foreach loop controls the  columns in each dog array  each row .  The third loop retrieves the column names  from $column  and places them in XML tags. $column is also   used to pull the value in the column  $dog_value[$column] . The $xmlstring supplies the same tags and  structure as in the original XML file. Note that each line includes a newline character  \n  to display different  lines in the file. The structure would work without this addition. However, if makes the file more readable in  a text editor.  Once the $xmlstring has been created, the code uses a combination of the PHP file_put_contents   method and the get_dog_application method  from Chapter 4  to open the XML file, replace the contents  with the string contained in $xmlstring, and close the file.  You need to make one more final adjustment to the constructor to allow it to handle XML parsing   errors. A parsing error occurs when something is wrong with the XML structure. The previous dog_breed  and dog_application XML files are not updated by the application and are fairly stable. However, the XML  file for the dog’s information will be updated frequently. You need to handle any problems that may occur.  You will raise a general error, which will be treated by dog_interface as an important error that is logged  and e-mailed to support personnel. It will also display a "System currently not available please try  again later" message to the users.  190   Chapter 6   Data ObjeCts  private $dogs_array = array  ; defined as an empty array initially libxml:use_internal_errors true ; function __construct   {          $xmlfile = file_get_contents get_dog_application "datastorage"  ;          $xmlstring = simplexml:load_string $xmlfile ;          if  $xmlstring === false  {                   $errorString = "Failed loading XML: ";                   foreach libxml:get_errors   as $error  {                          $errorString .= $error->message . " ";  }                   throw new Exception $errorString ; } $json = json_encode $xmlstring ; $this->dogs_array = json_decode $json,TRUE ; }  By default, XML parsing errors will cause the system to display the errors to the user and shut down   the program. The libxml:user_internal_errors true  method will suppress the errors. When the string  is converted to XML format via the simplexml:load_string method, the XML is parsed to determine if it  is valid. If it is not valid, the method will return FALSE instead of the XML information. The if statement  shown will create an $errorString and use the foreach statement to loop through each error returned by  the libxml:get_errors method  which returns an array containing the errors . Once all errors are collected,  it will raise an exception passing the $errorString. The dog_interface program will catch this error and  process it, as shown in Chapter 5.  This example does make one bad assumption  which simplifies the example . It assumes that the   $errorString does not exceed the maximum capacity of 120 characters for the log file. A very badly  formatted file could quickly cause $errorString to exceed this size. This limit can be adjusted in the PHP  configuration file.  With the data automatically being saved whenever the data object is removed from memory, the insert,  update, and delete methods only need to adjust the contents of the multidimensional associative array. Let’s  take a first look at creating a delete method since you have already seen an example in Chapter 5.  In the readerrorlog program  in Example 5-8  you created a deleterecord method. The method was   used for regular multidimensional arrays. We could make a few adjustments to this routine to create the  deleteRecord method for the dog_data class.  function deleteRecord $recordNumber  {         foreach  $this->dogs_array as $dogs=>&$dogs_value  {                 for $J=$recordNumber; $J < count $dogs_value  -1; $J++                              {                         foreach  $dogs_value[$J] as $column => $column_value                          {                                 $dogs_value[$J][$column] = $dogs_value[$J + 1][$column];                         }                 } unset  $dogs_value[count $dogs_value  -1] ;          }  }  In the previous deleterecord method, the number of rows in the array and the array itself were passed   into the method. The array in dog_data class is populated by the XML file containing the dog information.  There is no property set with the number of records. This is not a problem. The PHP method count will  return the size of an array. You can access and update the dogs_array  which is a protected private property   using the $this pointer. Methods in classes can use the this pointer to access and update protected  properties; it is not necessary to pass them into a method. The only property you need to pass to the  deleteRecord method is the record number  $recordNumber  to delete.  191   Chapter 6   Data ObjeCts  The associate array has three dimensions. The outer dimension is related to the dogs tag from the XML  structure. Although there is only one “row” for dogs, a loop is still needed to move into the next array  dog .  The foreach loop penetrates the dogs array and provides access to the dog array  which was created from  the dog tags in the XML file . $dogs will contain the number of the dog row currently used. $dogs_value  will contain the contents of the row  an array with the values in dog_name, dog_weight, dog_color, and  dog_breed .  To move through each row  array  contained in the dog array, the method uses a for loop. The   conditional statement  $J < count $dogs_value  -1  uses the count method to determine the size of the  dog array. The count method returns the size of the array, not the last position of the array. Thus the loop  count must be less than  <  the size returned from count. One is subtracted from this value. As stated in  Chapter 5, any row after a deleted row must be moved up one from its current position. The last position of  the array will no longer be needed, which reduces the number of loops needed by one.  In the Chapter 5 example, a for loop was used to pull each column from the row and place it in the row  above. With an associate array, you use a foreach loop. The $column parameter contains the column name   $J contains the row number  to place the values in the columns into the proper locations. After the values  in the rows have been moved, the last position of the array is removed using the PHP unset method.  Similar logic can be used in almost any program language. However, PHP associate arrays allow index   numbers to be skipped. Unlike other languages which would place a NULL value in a missing index, PHP  associate arrays just skip the actual index. Thus any array could have indexes of 0, 1, 2, 4, 5 and a foreach  loop would properly loop through the array. With this in mind we can greatly simplify the previous example  delete example to only contain one line of code, just the unset command shown. The unset command would  remove the index passed into the method from the dog_array. Any for loop using the dog_array would still  properly loop through the array. The example code contained in the demo website provides this ability. You can also make a few adjustments to the displayRecords method from Chapter 5 to return any   record s  that a calling program  such as the Dog class  requests.  function readRecords $recordNumber  { if $recordNumber === "ALL"  {                 return $this->dogs_array["dog"]; } else {                 return $this->dogs_array["dog"][$recordNumber];         } }  As you can see the readRecords method is more simplistic that the displayRecords method. All   formatting of the results of this method are left to the calling program  if needed . Remember that displaying  and formatting of output occurs in the interface tier, not the data tier  or business rules tier .  This method allows the calling program to request all records or a specific record. In either case it   returns an array with either one row  the specific record requested  or all rows. When all rows are returned,  the top array  representing the rows XML tag  is removed to keep the number of dimensions  two  the same  for either selection.  The insertRecords method accepts an associate array with the subscript names previously mentioned.   However, in order to allow for dependency injection and flexibility in the tag names for the XML file, the  calling program does not need not know the tag names until an instance of the dog_data class is created.  This can be accomplished by using the readRecords method to pull the first record and then have the calling  program examine the subscript names returned from that record.  192   Chapter 6   Data ObjeCts   function insertRecords $records_array  {         $dogs_array_size = count $this->dogs_array["dog"] ;         for $I=0;$I< count $records_array ;$I++          {                 $this->dogs_array["dog"][$dogs_array_size + $I] = $records_array[$I];          } }     Note  the process of creating the dog_array using the jsON functions shown previously will create one  inconsistency in creating the dog_array. If the dog_data.xml file contains only one record, the jsON functions  will not create a numeric index  such as '0' . When more than one record is contained in the xml file the  numeric indexes will be created  such as '0', '1' . an alternative solution to which handles these differences is  provided in the demo files on the textbook website.  In the insertRecords method, all records are added to the end of the array  the calling program can  sort them if needed . The current size of dogs_array is determined by the count method and stored into  $dogs_array_size. The count method is also used inside the for structure to determine the size of the  $records_array and to determine the number of loops. Since the results of the count method produces the  size of the array, which is one more than the last subscript position, the result of count also gives the next  position available to insert a record.  In the first loop, $I is 0. The first record of $records_array is placed into $dogs_array_size plus 0, or  $dogs_array_size  the first open row to place a record . The next time through the loop, the second record  of $records_array  $I was incremented by the loop  is placed into position $dogs_array_size plus 1. This  is the next position available after the first record has been inserted. The loop will continue until there are no  more records in the $records_array. By the way, this method also works well with just one record to insert   as long as it is passed as an associate array . The loop will execute only once.  The last method you need to examine is an update method. This method is a very simple form of the   destructor method.  function updateRecords $records_array  {         foreach  $records_array as $records=>$records_value  {                 foreach  $records_value as $record => $record_value  {                          $this->dogs_array["dog"][$records] = $records_array[$records];                 }         } }  This little tiny method will take any size associate array and update the dogs array. It is based on PHP’s   ability to dynamically build arrays.  $records_array = Array   0 => Array   "dog_name" => "Jeffrey", "dog_weight" => "19", "dog_color" => "Green",   "dog_breed" => "Lab"  , 2 => Array   "dog_name" => "James", "dog_weight" => "21", "dog_color" => "Black",   "dog_breed" => "Mixed"   ;  193   Chapter 6   Data ObjeCts  Dynamically built arrays are not required to have values for every position in the array. If the dynamic  array shown previously is passed into the updateRecords method, records 0 and 2 would be updated with  the new information. The value in position 1 in the dogs array would remain untouched.  Take a moment to look at these methods. There are only two XML tags that have been coded in   the methods  dogs and dog . Even those two could have been retrieved from the XML file. However, the  assumption that these tags will always exist in a valid dog XML file makes logical sense. By dynamically pulling  all of the other tags  dog_name, dog_weight, dog_color, and dog_breed  from the XML file, changes can be  made to the file without causing any code changes. Additional tags can be added, removed, and or changed.  Let’s put it all together.  Example 6-1.  The dog_data.php file  <?php class dog_data { private $dogs_array = array  ;   defined as an empty array initially private $dog_data_xml = ""; function __construct   {         libxml:use_internal_errors true ;         $xmlDoc = new DOMDocument  ;         if   file_exists "e5dog_applications.xml"           {         $xmlDoc->load  'e5dog_applications.xml'  ;         $searchNode = $xmlDoc->getElementsByTagName  "type"  ;                 foreach  $searchNode as $searchNode                   {                         $valueID = $searchNode->getAttribute 'ID' ;                         if $valueID == "datastorage"                          {                                 $xmlLocation = $searchNode->getElementsByTagName  "location"  ;                                 $this->dog_data_xml = $xmlLocation->item 0 ->nodeValue;                                 break;                         }                 }  }         else { throw new Exception "Dog applications xml file missing or corrupt" ; } $xmlfile = file_get_contents $this->dog_data_xml ;         $xmlstring = simplexml:load_string $xmlfile ;                   if  $xmlstring === false  {                 $errorString = "Failed loading XML: ";                 foreach libxml:get_errors   as $error  {                         $errorString .= $error->message . " " ;  }                 throw new Exception $errorString ; }         $json = json_encode $xmlstring ;         $this->dogs_array = json_decode $json,TRUE ;         } function __destruct   {         $xmlstring = ' ';             $xmlstring .= "\n \n";             foreach  $this->dogs_array as $dogs=>$dogs_value  {  194   Chapter 6   Data ObjeCts                  foreach  $dogs_value as $dog => $dog_value                  {                         $xmlstring .=" \n";                                 foreach  $dog_value as $column => $column_value                                  {                                 $xmlstring .= " " . $dog_value[$column] . " \n";                                 }                         $xmlstring .= " \n";                 }     }         $xmlstring .= " \n";         file_put_contents $this->dog_data_xml,$xmlstring ; }   function deleteRecord $recordNumber  {         foreach  $this->dogs_array as $dogs=>&$dogs_value  {                 for $J=$recordNumber; $J < count $dogs_value  -1; $J++  {                                                        foreach  $dogs_value[$J] as $column => $column_value                          {                                 $dogs_value[$J][$column] = $dogs_value[$J + 1][$column];                         }                   }         unset  $dogs_value[count $dogs_value  -1] ;         }  } function readRecords $recordNumber   {         if $recordNumber === "ALL"  {                 return $this->dogs_array["dog"];         }         else         {                 return $this->dogs_array["dog"][$recordNumber];         } }   function insertRecords $records_array  {         $dogs_array_size = count $this->dogs_array["dog"] ;         for $I=0;$I< count $records_array ;$I++          {                 $this->dogs_array["dog"][$dogs_array_size + $I] = $records_array[$I];         } }    195   Chapter 6   Data ObjeCts  function updateRecords $records_array  {         foreach  $records_array as $records=>$records_value          {                 foreach  $records_value as $record => $record_value                  {                             $this->dogs_array["dog"][$records] = $records_array[$records];                 }         } } } ?>     Note  an alternative solution which handles associate arrays with missing indexes, and the possibility that  the dog_data.xml file may contain one or zero records, is provided on the textbook website.  The only change in this final version of the dog_data class is the inclusion of get_dog_application   method code in the constructor to retrieve the location and name of the XML file holding the dog data.  Example 6-2.  The testdata.php file  <?php include "dog_data.php" ; $tester = new dog_data  ; $records_array = Array   0 => Array   "dog_name" => "Sally", "dog_weight" => "19", "dog_color" => "Green",   "dog_breed" => "Lab"   ; $tester->insertRecords $records_array ; print_r  $tester->readRecords "ALL"  ; print " " ;   $records_array = Array   1 => Array   "dog_name" => "Spot", "dog_weight" => "19", "dog_color" => "Green",   "dog_breed" => "Lab"   ;   $tester->updateRecords $records_array ; print_r  $tester->readRecords "ALL"  ; print " " ;   $tester->deleteRecord 1 ; print_r  $tester->readRecords "ALL"  ; $tester = NULL;    calls the destructor and saves the xml records in the file ?>  Example 6-2 tests some of the possible scenarios of using the dog_data class. Notice the last line of code   calls the destructor  to save the data . This is accomplished by setting the pointer to the object  $tester  to  NULL, which releases the object. This will inform the garbage collector of the operating system that the object  should be removed from memory. This will cause the destructor to execute, which will update the XML file  and remove the object from the memory of the server.  196   JSON Data  Let’s take a second to back up and look at the ability to read and write JSON data. Using the example code  shown in this chapter, only the constructor and destructor will need to be adjusted when you use other  forms of data besides XML. Accessing and using JSON data is even easier than using XML data.  Chapter 6   Data ObjeCts  ... $json = file_get_contents $this->dog_data_JSON ; $this->dogs_array = json_decode $json,TRUE ; if  $this->dogs_array === null && json_last_error   !== JSON_ERROR_NONE  {      throw new Exception "JSON error: " . json_last_error_msg   ; } ...  In the constructor, after the if else structure that retrieves the location of the data from the    dog_application.xml file, the multiple lines accessing and formatting the XML data can be replaced by  the lines shown previously. The json_decode method  as shown previously  will attempt to format the data  from the text file into the associate array format. If the data is not a valid JSON format, an exception is thrown  passing the error message. Since the Exception class is used, the dog_interface program would log this  information in the error log, e-mail the support personnel, and display a general message to the users.  $json = json_encode $this->dogs_array ; file_put_contents $this->dog_data_JSON,$json ;  The complete code for the destructor requires only two lines. The json_encode method will convert the   associate array data into JSON format. The file_put_contents method will then save the information to  the proper location of the JSON file  $this->dog_data_JSON . No changes are required to any of the other  methods in dog_data. Note: An example application using JSON data is available on the book’s web site  under Chapter 6.  MySQL Data  This book is intended as an introduction to the PHP language. Thus, you will not spend much time learning  about database usage. However, this is a good time to give a brief example of adjustments you can make to  the constructor and destructor methods to access and update database information.     Note  mysql has been removed since php5.5. It is recommended that you use mysqli or pdo_mysql.  $mysqli =mysqli_connect $server, $db_username, $db_password, $database ;   if  mysqli_connect_errno      {           throw new Exception "MySQL connection error: " . mysqli_connect_error   ;   }   $sql="SELECT * FROM Dogs"; $result=mysqli_query $con,$sql ;    197   Chapter 6   Data ObjeCts  If $result===null  {            throw new Exception "No records retrieved from Database" ; }   $this->dogs_array = mysqli_fetch_assoc $result ;   mysqli_free_result $result ;   mysqli_close $con ;  Most of the code required for the constructor method is associated to connecting, retrieving, and   disconnecting from the database. The mysqli_connect method uses the server location  $server , database  user ID  $db_username , database password  $db_password , and database name  $database  to connect to  the database. If mysqli_connect_errno contains any errors an Exception is thrown describing the error. If  there are no errors, a SQL SELECT statement  $sql  is used to retrieve all the records from the Dogs table in  the database. If no records are retrieved, another exception is thrown. If records are retrieved, the mysqli_ fetch_assoc method will convert the data into an associate array. The mysqli_free_result statement  releases the data from $result. The mysqli_close method closes access to the database.  The destructor takes a little more coding. However, the looping is similar to saving the XML data.  $mysqli = new mysqli $server, $db_username, $db_password, $database ; if  $mysqli->connect_errno  {           throw new Exception "MySQL connection error:" . $mysqli->connect_error ; } If   !$mysqli->query "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Dogs"        !$mysqli->query "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Dogs  dog_id CHAR 4 , dog_name CHAR 20 ,   dog_weight CHAR 3 , dog_color CHAR 15 , dog_breed CHAR 35 "     { throw new Exception "Dog table can't be created or deleted. Error: " . $mysqli->error ; } foreach  $this->dogs_array as $dogs=>$dogs_value  {         foreach  $dogs_value as $dog => $dog_value          {                 $dog_id = $dog_value["dog_id"];                 $dog_name = $dog_value["dog_name"];                 $dog_weight = $dog_value["dog_weight"];                 $dog_color = $dog_value["dog_color"];                 $dog_breed = $dog_value["dog_breed"];                 If !$mysqli->query "INSERT INTO Dogs dog_id, dog_name, dog_weight, dog_color,                 dog_breed  VALUES  '$dog_id', '$dog_name', '$dog_weight', '$dog_color',                 '$dog_breed' "                   {                         throw new Exception "Dog Table Insert Error: " . $mysqli->error ;                 }         } } ...  198   Chapter 6   Data ObjeCts  The destructor method attempts to connect to the database. If the connection is successful, the method  removes any preexisting Dogs table and creates a new one with the required fields.  Note: It would probably  be better to rename the old one and create a new one. . If the old table can be removed and the new table  created, then the method attempts to insert rows into the table. The SQL INSERT statement places the values  from $dog_name, $dog_weight, $dog_color, and $dog_breed into a row in the table. The foreach loops  retrieve each row from the associate array to be placed into the table. If any of the inserts are not successful,  an exception is thrown. An example program is located under Chapter 6 on the book’s web site.  Programming note—The Apache server must be properly configured and MySQL must  be properly installed to run this  or a similar  database example. $server must be set  to the URL, “localhost”, or “127.0.0.1”. $db_username must be set to the user ID name to  access the database  'root' if a user ID has not been configured . $db_password must be  set to the database password  or '' if there is no password . $database must be set to the  database name. There is a large varieties of ways to access and manipulate databases  in the PHP language.  Do It    1.  Download the example files for this section from the book’s web site. Adjust the  deleteRecords method to allow the ability to delete multiple records. However,  also include a check to limit the amount of records that can be deleted. It would  not be very secure to allow all records to be deleted. If an attempt is made to  delete all records  or too many records , an exception should be raised. The  exception should cause the calling program  eventually dog_interface  to write  an error message to the main log file, e-mail the support personnel, and display  the general message to the users  shown in Chapter 5 . Adjust the testdata  program to test the ability to delete multiple records and catch the exceptions.     2.  Download the example files for this section from the book’s web site. Adjust the   testdata program to test all remaining scenarios that have not already been  tested. These are related to inserting, updating  more than one , reading, and  deleting records. Be sure to test improperly formatted information. Create a try  catch block in the testdata program to capture any exceptions. You can use the  try catch block from dog_interface in Chapter 5 as an example.  Backup and Recovery  There is always a possibility that something can go wrong when changes are made to stored information.  While a well-developed application must filter and clean data before it is saved; it must also be prepared  to handle the possibility that bad data may still flowed through and corrupt the information. In addition  to intentional corruption, unforeseen problems  such as system crashes  may occur. An application must  provide the ability to recover without the loss of data. This can be accomplished by logging change requests  and backing up valid information. Recovery can be accomplished by using a valid backup and reapplying  valid changes to the backup files to produce up-to-date information.  You can make just a few minor changes to the dogdata file  Example 6-1  to create a change log and   to provide backup and recovery capability. First, you will create a main method  processRecords  that will  interpret any data passed into the class. This function will simplify the recovery process by allowing the  recovery program to pass all change log information into one method. This will also make dependency  injection easier to accomplish.  199   Chapter 6   Data ObjeCts  function processRecords $change_Type, $records_array  { switch $change_Type  {         case "Delete":                 $this->deleteRecord $records_array ;                 break;         case "Insert":                 $this->insertRecords $records_array ;                 break;         case "Update":                 $this->updateRecords $records_array ;                 break;         case "Display":                 $this->readRecords $records_array ;                 Break;         default:                 throw new Exception "Invalid XML file change type: $change_Type" ; } }  All requests for changes will now be passed through this method. The method accepts a change type    Insert, Delete, Update, or Display  and the array  for Insert or Update  or the record number  for Delete  or Update . The values are passed into $record_array. $record_array is dynamically created as either an  array or a string. This allows the processRecords method to provide polymorphism  the ability for the same  method call to accept different parameters , which is one of the requirements of an object-oriented language   along with encapsulation and inheritance . The switch statement looks at $change_Type to determine  which method to call. It then calls the related method. If an invalid type is passed, an exception is thrown.  Security  and  performance—In  a  ‘live’  environment,  it  would  be  more  secure  to  pass  “codes” into this type of method instead of using a value that indicates the action that will  take place. For example, 101 could be used to indicate an update. The switch statement  could easily be adjusted to examine the codes to determine which method to call.  Each of the methods that you have examined previously  except for the constructor and destructor    are now set to 'private'. This makes the process much more secure; changes can only occur by using the  processRecords method. Three code lines have also been added to the end of each of the three methods to  provide backup and recovery capabilities.  ... $change_string = date 'mdYhis'  . "  Delete  " . $recordNumber . "\n"; $chge_log_file = date 'mdYhis'  . $this->change_log_file; error_log $change_string,3,$chge_log_file ;    might exceed 120 chars ...  The first line formats a string for a change log file. The format used is similar to the format you look at in   Chapter 5. In the previous example, the record number is passed as required for the delete method.  $change_string = date 'mdYhis'  . "  Update  " . serialize $records_array  . "\n";  For update and insert, the arrays are passed. However, an array cannot be placed into a string. The   serialize method transforms an array into a string format similar to the following.  200   Chapter 6   Data ObjeCts  a:1:{i:0;a:4:{s:8:"dog_name";s:7:"Spot";s:10:"dog_weight";s:2:"19";s:9:  "dog_color";s:5:"Green";s:9:"dog_breed";s:3:"Lab";}}  The data in a serialized string can be returned to an array format  or another format  using the unserialize   method. The second line creates a string  $chge_log_file , which uses the date method and the log file name  located in the dog_applications XML file to create a backup file name  and location . The string created is then  passed to this log using the error_log method. The contents of the log file will look similar to the following.  07142015042510  Insert  a:1:{i:0;a:4:{s:8:"dog_name";s:7:"tester1";s:10:  "dog_weight";s:2:"19";s:9:"dog_color";s:5:"Green";s:9:"dog_breed";s:3:"Lab";}} 07142015042510  Update  a:1:{i:1;a:4:{s:8:"dog_name";s:7:"tester2";s:10:  "dog_weight";s:2:"19";s:9:"dog_color";s:5:"Green";s:9:"dog_breed";s:3:"Lab";}} 07142015042510  Delete  1  This format provides all the information needed to help with the recovery process. If the current version  of the dog data file is corrupted, the change log file can be used to apply changes to a good version of the file  to develop a new current version.  The only other changes needed to the data class are a few additional code lines in the destructor.  $new_valid_data_file = preg_replace ' [0-9]+ ', '', $this->dog_data_xml ;    remove the previous date and time if it exists $oldxmldata = date 'mdYhis'  . $new_valid_data_file; if  !rename $this->dog_data_xml, $oldxmldata            {            throw new Exception "Backup file $oldxmldata could not be created." ;         } file_put_contents $new_valid_data_file,$xmlstring ;  Before the destructor uses the file_put_contents method to apply changes to the XML file, a backup  should be created in case the changes cause corruption to the current data. The recovery process will allow  the support personnel to select which data file contains good data and which change file s  will be applied  to the data to produce the correct current version of the data.  Because this process may use a backup file of the data, which includes a file name with a date and time,  the preg_replace method is used to remove any numerical information from the data file name. The regular  expression   [0-9]+   in the first parameter directs the method to search for all occurrences of numbers  in $this->dog_data_xml. If any occurrence is found, it is replaced with the value in the second parameter   '' . In this case, nothing. The new file name is then placed in $new_valid_data_file. This will not cause  any change to a “normal” non-backup file name because it does not contain any numerical information.  A new backup file name is created using the file name in $new_valid_data_file with the date and time  information. The new backup file name is stored in $oldxmldata.  Now the last valid data can be moved to the new backup file using the rename method. The data in  $this->dog_data_xml  the location of the good data without changes  is copied to the new backup file  location  $oldxmldata . If the file cannot be renamed, an exception is thrown.  Finally the valid changed data  located in $xmlstring  can be placed into the new location of the valid data    which is the same file name without any date information  contained in the $new_valid_data_file property.  For example, if 07142015042510dog_data.xml contains the last valid data available,   07152015001510dog_data.xml might be the new location of this data before any changes are applied. dog_ data.xml would be the location of the valid data after changes have been applied. The last coding change to  the dog data class is the inclusion of a set method.  function setChangeLogFile $value  { $this->dog_data_xml = $value; }  201   Chapter 6   Data ObjeCts  To allow the recovery application to use the last valid data, the application must have the ability to change   the location of the valid data. The setChangeLogFile method changes the value in $this->dog_data_xml.  This property was originally set from locating information in the dog application XML file. However, that might  not currently be the location of valid data. The code added to the destructor will use the new location of the  valid data, apply the changes needed, and place valid data back into the original data file. There is no need to  make any changes to the data_application XML file. After the destructor completes, the data file will now  contain the most up-to-date valid data.  Example 6-3.

Now that you have the ability to provide backup and recovery, let’s make some adjustments to the   readerrorlog file  in Example 5-8 . The new application will need to allow the support personnel to select   and modify  any valid change log file, select the most valid data file available, and apply the changes from  the change log file to produce a new valid data XML file.  if isset $_POST['data_File']   {           update_XML_File_Process  ; } else if isset $_GET['rn']   {           delete_Process  ; } else if isset $_POST['change_file']   {           display_Process  ; }  204   Chapter 6   Data ObjeCts  else {         select_File_Process  ; }  Since the code has grown in length, it will be much easier to follow the logical flow  and to modify the  code when necessary  if much of the work is done in methods. As with many applications, the main flow of  the program becomes one embedded if else statement.  Figure 6-1.  The readchangelog.php file requesting selection of a change log file  Upon opening the application, a list box will allow the users to select which valid change log file to use   and possibly update . The else portion of the statement will direct the program to select_File_Process,  which will handle this request.  Figure 6-2.  The readchangelog file displaying the selected log and requesting the valid data file  Once the user has selected a change file, the contents of the file will be displayed in the same manner  as shown in Chapter 5. The display_Process method will provide this information. The user can decide to  remove some entries in the change file selected. If deletions are needed, the delete_Process method will  complete the process, using the same techniques shown in Chapter 5. In addition, the same method will  allow the user to select the most recent valid data file to apply changes.  Once the data file has been selected, update_XML_File_Process will apply the changes to the file using   the dogdata program  in Example 6-3 . The process will display a changes completed message to the user.  The select_File_Process method uses similar logic as found in the getbreeds.php program     in Example 4-5 .  205   Chapter 6   Data ObjeCts  function select_File_Process   { $directory = ""; $files = glob $directory . "*change.log" ; echo " "; echo " Select a file to display "; echo " "; foreach $files as $file  {         echo " $file "; } echo " "; echo " "; echo " "; }  The PHP glob method places all file names in a given directory  $directory  into an array  $files .   Setting $directory to "" indicates that the current directory will be searched. The second parameter  provides the ability to filter the file types retrieved. *change.log directs the method to pull all files with the  ending change.log. The *  asterisk  is a wildcard character that accepts any characters. This combination  will pull all the change log files produced by the dog_data class. The remaining lines create an HTML drop- down list displaying the file names retrieved. A submit will cause the program to call itself again with the  selected file residing in the change_file property.  function display_Process   { $change_Array = load_Array  ; $row_Count = count $change_Array  -1; displayRecords $row_Count, $change_Array, $_POST['change_file'] ; }   display_Process is called when a change file has been selected. This method calls the   load_Array method. function load_Array   { $change_File = $_POST['change_file']; $logFile = fopen $change_File, "r" ; $row_Count = 0; while !feof $logFile   {             $change_Array[$row_Count] = explode '  ', fgets $logFile  ;             $row_Count++; } $row_Count--; fclose $logFile ; return $change_Array; }  The load_Array method is very similar to the constructor in the dog_data class. This method retrieves   the value in change_file and places it in $change_File. This file is then opened and all entries in the file are  placed into $change_Array. The explode method will produce three columns  date time, change type, array  or string used for the change . It returns this array to the calling program  display_Process .  206   Chapter 6   Data ObjeCts  The array is returned to $change_Array in display_Process. The count method determines the   size of this array. Its value is placed in $row_count. displayRecords is called, passing the row_count, the  change_Array, and the change_file into displayRecords.  function displayRecords $row_Count, $change_Array, $change_File  { echo "  "; echo "  table { border: 2px solid 5c744d;}   "; echo "  "; echo " "; echo " Log File: " . $change_File . " "; echo "    Date Time  Change Type  Change Data   "; for  $J=$row_Count -1; $J >= 0; $J--  {         echo "  Delete  ";         for $I=0; $I < 3; $I++                  {                 echo "  " . $change_Array[$J][$I] . "   ";         }         echo " "; } echo " "; echo "  ";   $directory = ""; $files = glob $directory . "*dog_data.xml" ; echo " "; echo " Delete entries above or select a file to update with change log $change_File "; echo " "; foreach $files as $file  {         echo " $file "; } echo " "; echo " "; echo " "; echo " "; }  displayRecords displays the contents of the change log file using almost exactly the same logic used   in the displayRecords method of the readerrorlog program  in Example 5-8 . It also uses almost the same  logic as the selectFileProcess  explained previously  to display the data files for the user to select the last  uncorrupted file.  If the user decides to delete some records from the change log, the delete_Process is called.  function delete_Process   { $change_Array = load_Array  ; deleteRecord $_GET['rn'], $row_Count, $change_Array ; saveChanges $row_Count,$change_Array,$change_File ; displayRecords $row_Count,$change_Array,$change_File ; }  207   Chapter 6   Data ObjeCts  The delete_Process method will place the change file records into $change_Array using the same  change_Array as shown before. It will pass the record number to be deleted  $_GET['rn'] , the number  of rows in the array  $row_Count , and the array  $change_Array  into the deleteRecord method.  The deleteRecords method will use the same logic as shown in the deleteRecord method from the  readerrorlog  in Example 5-8  program. The delete_Process will then call the saveChanges method,  passing in the row_count, change_Array, and change_File information.  function saveChanges $row_Count,$change_Array,$change_File  {         $changeFile = fopen $change_File, "w" ;         for $I=0; $I < $row_Count; $I++          {              $writeString = $change_Array[$I][0] . "  " . $change_Array[$I][1] . "  " .   $change_Array[$I][2];             fwrite $changeFile, $writeString ;         }         fclose $changeFile ; }  The saveChanges method builds the date time-changetype-changedata format, seen previously, from  the change_Array. This information is saved in $writeString and is used to replace the change log file with  the updated version  minus the record that was deleted .  The delete_Process method then recalls the displayRecords method  described earlier  to display the   updated change log  minus the record deleted  and the data file drop-down list.  Once the user selects the data file to be changed, the update_XML_File_Process method is called.  function update_XML_File_Process   { $change_Array = load_Array  ; require_once "dog_data.php" ; $data_Changer = new dog_data  ; $row_Count = count $change_Array  -1; for $I=0;$I < $row_Count; $I++  {    if $change_Array[$I][1] != "Delete"          {                 $temp = unserialize $change_Array[$I][2] ;         }         else         {                 $temp =  integer $change_Array[$I][2];         }         $data_Changer->processRecords $change_Array[$I][1], $temp ; }  The method calls the load_Array method to return the changes into $change_Array. The dog_data file   is imported into the method to prepare for the changes to the data file selected by the user. An instance of  the data_data class is created  $data_Changer .  208   Chapter 6   Data ObjeCts  A for loop is used to peruse the change array and to pass each change into the processRecords   method of the data class. However, before the records are passed, the serialized data must be returned to  an associate array format using the unserialize method. If the change request is Delete, type casting must  occur to change the data  record number  into an integer. This is one of the few times that PHP requires type  casting. Serialized data is not considered a data type. The data must be transformed by either unserializing  it or type casting it. The change type  Update, Delete, or Insert  is passed into the first parameter of the  processRecords method. The change array or the record number is passed into the second parameter of  the method. All changes are made to the data, the file is backed up, and a new change log is created, in case  there are more corruption problems.  Example 6-4.

Actually,  no changes at all. As long as the changes from the first section of this chapter are implemented, the  displaychangelog program and the changes to the dog_data class will handle JSON in the same manner as  XML data.  MySQL Backup and Recovery  As you might be guessing, as long as the changes from the second section of this chapter are implemented,  no additional changes will be required for backup and recovery of MySQL data. However, you can take a  moment to look at an alternative way of handling MySQL data.  It is a common practice to create a SQL script file to execute against a database. A script file contains   all the SQL code necessary to update the database. Using this type of file will allow you to do proper INSERT,  UPDATE, and DELETE SQL commands instead of only an INSERT as previously shown. The previous example  required creating an INSERT command for every record in the associate array. This includes records that  were not changed. This would be inefficient for medium to large databases. You only need to update the  record that changed.  You can develop the scripting file from records in the associate array that have changed. You can use the  change log as the script file, as the SQL script lists all changes that have been requested. It can be rerun to fix  any corrupted data.  211   Chapter 6   Data ObjeCts  For example, in the updateRecords method, you can create any required SQL UPDATE commands.  private function updateRecords $records_array  {         $chge_log_file = date 'mdYhis'  . $this->change_log_file;         $chge_string = "";         foreach  $records_array as $records=>$records_value          {                 $this->dogs_array["dog"][$records] = $records_array[$records];                 $chge_string .=  "UPDATE Dogs ";                 $chge_string  .= "SET dog_name='" . $records_array[$records]['dog_name'] ."', ";                 $chge_string .= "dog_weight='" . $records_array[$records]['dog_weight'] ."',                 $chge_string .= "dog_color='" . $records_array[$records]['dog_color'] ."', ";                 $chge_string .= "dog_breed='" . $records_array[$records]['dog_breed'] ."' ";                 $chge_string  .= "WHERE dog_id='" . $records_array[$records]['dog_id'] . "';\n";         }         $chge_log_file = date 'mdYhis'  . $this->change_log_file;         error_log $chge_string,3,$chge_log_file ;    might exceed 120 chars }  These changes would build all the update requirements from the associate array. Similar changes could   also be done to the insert and delete methods.  private function deleteRecord $recordNumber  {         foreach  $this->dogs_array as $dogs=>&$dogs_value  {                 for $J=$recordNumber; $J < count $dogs_value  -1; $J++  {                         foreach  $dogs_value[$J] as $column => $column_value                          {                                 $dogs_value[$J][$column] = $dogs_value[$J + 1][$column];                         } }         unset  $dogs_value[count $dogs_value  -1] ;         }         $dog_id = $this->dogs_array['dog'][$recordNumber]['dog_id'];         $chge_string = "DELETE FROM Dogs WHERE dog_id='" . $dog_id . "';\n";         $chge_log_file = date 'mdYhis'  . $this->change_log_file;         error_log $chge_string,3,$chge_log_file ;    might exceed 120 chars  }  This example delete method deletes one record at a time. Thus, the delete string is built outside of   the loop. The update method allows for multiple records to be updated, so the update string is built inside  of the loop. The insert method will also require you to build the string inside the loop.  private function insertRecords $records_array  {         $chge_string = "";         $dogs_array_size = count $this->dogs_array["dog"] ;         for $I=0;$I< count $records_array ;$I++          {  212   Chapter 6   Data ObjeCts                  $this->dogs_array["dog"][$dogs_array_size + $I] = $records_array[$I];                 $dog_id = rand 0,9999 ;    get a number between 0 and 9999                 while  in_array $dog_id, $this->dogs_array, true      in array?                 { $dog_id = rand 0,9999 ;    if it is get another number } $chge_string .="INSERT INTO Dogs VALUES '";                 $chge_string .= $dog_id . "', '" . $records_array[$I]['dog_name'] . "', '";                 $chge_string .= $records_array[$I]['dog_weight'] . "', '";                 $chge_string .= $records_array[$I]['dog_color'] . "', '";                 $chge_string .= $records_array[$I]['dog_breed'] . "' ;";         }         $chge_log_file = date 'mdYhis'  . $this->change_log_file;         error_log $chge_string,3,$chge_log_file ;    might exceed 120 chars }  If you review the changeRecords method, a SQL WHERE clause was built using a property named dog_id.  In the XML and JSON examples you did not have this field. However, SQL UPDATE requires a where clause to  determine which record s  to update. The property used needs to be unique to identify the exact record s .  The only place the code must generate this dog_id is when a new record is created in the database  in the  insertRecords method . This can be done using the PHP rand method.  The PHP rand method produces random numbers. The first parameter is the starting number  0    and the second parameter is the last number  9999 . The size of this field is set to char 4  in the database,  which allows up to four characters. This would allow you up to 10,000 dogs. I am sure that will be more than  enough!  The while loop in the insertRecords method uses the PHP in_array method to determine if the  number is already in the dogs_array  which contains all the current records in the database . A third  parameter, which determines if a strict search  comparing data types  should occur, must be set to  produce reliable results with multidimensional associate arrays. If the number does exist, the logic continues  to generate a new random number until a unique one is found. The value is then placed in $dog_id, which  will be inserted into the database along with the other fields  dog_name, dog_weight, dog_color, and   dog_breed . Note: This code assumes that the Dogs table in the database has been created with the fields in  the order shown  dog_id, dog_name, dog_weight, dog_color, and dog_breed .  The change log  which is now also a SQL script file  would now contain statements similar to the   following:  INSERT INTO Dogs VALUES '2288', 'tester1', '19', 'Green', 'Lab' ; UPDATE Dogs SET dog_name='tester1', dog_weight='19', dog_color='Green',   dog_breed='Lab' WHERE dog_id='0111'; UPDATE Dogs SET dog_name='tester2', dog_weight='19', dog_color='Green',   dog_breed='Lab' WHERE dog_id='1211'; DELETE FROM Dogs WHERE dog_id='1111';  This file can be run against the database when all changes have been logged. The destructor can now   execute this file  instead of removing the table and inserting all the records back into a new table .  $mysqli = new mysqli $server, $db_username, $db_password, $database ; if  $mysqli->connect_errno  {            throw new Exception "MySQL connection error:" . $mysqli->connect_error ; }  213   Chapter 6   Data ObjeCts  $chge_log_file = date 'mdYhis'  . $this->change_log_file; $sql = explode ";",file_get_contents $chge_log_file  ; foreach $sql as $query   {           If !$mysqli->query $query                   {                         throw new Exception "Dog Table Change Error: " . $mysqli->error ;                 } }  The code for the destructor becomes simpler than in the original MySQL example. The destructor does  not need to format any SQL statements. It only needs to execute them. The method reads the change records  from the change log, splitting each via the ; at the end of each SQL command line. Each line is placed in the  array $sql. The logic then loops through the array and executes each statement via the query command. If  any of the SQL statements has a problem, an exception is thrown  which will also send an e-mail to support  personnel via the dog_interface program . An example program is available on the book’s web site.  Note: As stated, the MySQL examples are shown to help the reader see that the overall logic of the  dog_data class works well with all data types. Complete books are written on using PHP to interact with  databases. It is not the intent of this book to train the user to have complete knowledge of database  manipulation.  Do It    1.  The dog_data class creates a new log file every time it is run. This could cause a   lot of log files to be created in a very short period of time. Your mission is to either  update the readchangelog file  download it from the book’s web site  or to create  your own maintenance program. The code will ask the users for the number  of log files  and data files  to keep. The program will then keep the most recent  number of files requested. The glob method, as shown previously, can be used to  retrieve all the file names. The unlink method can be used to delete a file.  unlink $file ;     2.  The MySQL examples shown now produce different contents in the change log  file. Download the readchangelog program from the book’s web site and make  any adjustments needed to the code to properly view and delete the change  log. Assuming that the database administrator has reversed the contents of the  database to the last valid set of data, adjust the program to execute the change  log selected against the database. Hint: Your completed program will have less  code than the example from the book’s web site.  Connecting the Data Tier  Now that a reliable, well tested, data class has been created, it is time to connect it to the business rules tier.  The Dog class will use the dog_data class to store the dog information in an XML file.  if  method_exists 'dog_container', 'create_object'   {   $this->breedxml = $properties_array[4];    214   Chapter 6   Data ObjeCts  $name_error = $this->set_dog_name $properties_array[0]  == TRUE ? 'TRUE,' : 'FALSE,';   $color_error = $this->set_dog_color $properties_array[2]  == TRUE ? 'TRUE,' : 'FALSE,';   $weight_error= $this->set_dog_weight $properties_array[3]  == TRUE ? 'TRUE' : 'FALSE';   $breed_error = $this->set_dog_breed $properties_array[1]  == TRUE ? 'TRUE,' : 'FALSE,';   $this->error_message = $name_error . $breed_error . $color_error . $weight_error;   $this->save_dog_data  ;   if stristr $this->error_message, 'FALSE'   {         throw new setException $this->error_message ; } } else {         exit; }  The constructor of the dog class sets all the properties and throws an exception if there are problems. If   no problems exist, the information is saved  via save_dog_data , and the program closes  exit .  In order to keep the data tier independent of the business rules tier, dependency injection will be used   to discover the location and name of the dog_data class and to call the processRecords method from the  class. You will borrow the logic from Chapter 4. Actually, you can use the dog_container from Example 4-10  without any changes. If you don’t remember the details of this class, revisit Chapter 4.  The dog_container class includes the get_dog_application method, which uses the logic discussed   several times to search the dog application XML file for the name of the file needed  dog_data.php . The  set_app method allows you to pass the application type  dogdata  to search in get_dog_application. It  also includes the create_object class that will determine the class name  dog_data , make an instance of  the class, and pass the class  the address of the class in memory  back to the calling program. The class does  require that a clean_input function exist in the calling program. You don’t currently have one in the Dog  class. However, you can create a shell  an empty function  in the class to meet this requirement.  To use the container, you can use the logic that was in the dog_interface program to make an instance   of the container, find the location of dog_data, and make an instance of dog_data  without knowing the  class name .  function clean_input   { } private function save_dog_data   { if   file_exists "e5dog_container.php"   {         require_once "e5dog_container.php" ;    use chapter 5 container w exception handling } else {         throw new Exception "Dog container file missing or corrupt" ; }         $container = new dog_container "dogdata" ;    sets the tag name to look for in XML file         $properties_array = array "dogdata" ;    not used but must be passed into create_object         $dog_data = $container->create_object $properties_array ;    creates dog_data object         $method_array = get_class_methods $dog_data ;         $last_position = count $method_array  - 1;  215   Chapter 6   Data ObjeCts          $method_name = $method_array[$last_position];          $record_Array = array array 'dog_name'=>"$this->dog_name", 'dog_weight'=>   "$this->dog_weight", 'dog_color'=>"$this->dog_color", 'dog_breed'=>"$this->dog_breed"  ;          $dog_data->$method_name "Insert",$record_Array ;         $dog_data = NULL; }  The lines to accomplish this are the same as seen previously in the dog_interface; you create the   dog_container, find the location of the dogdata file, and create an instance of the dog_data class. The only  difference is that “dogdata” is passed in for the search. The PHP function get_class_methods is used to  create a list of methods in the dog_data class. The last method in the class is processRecords. The name  of this method is pulled and placed into $method_name. The record_Array is then built to be passed into  processRecords. The method is called, passing "Insert" and the record_Array. Finally, the dog_data  object is set to NULL, which causes the destructor to save the data.  This allows complete dependency injection. The dog object does not know the name of the dog_data   class, the location of the dog_data class, or the name of the method to call until it is determined by this code.  This creates a complete break between the data tier and the business rules tier, as required for   three-tier design.  Example 6-5.

Three-tier dog application  The interface tier contains the lab.html file and the dog_interface.php program. The business rules   tier includes the dog.php class and the get_breeds class. The dog_data class is in the data tier. Any requests  from the dog_interface program for communications with the business rules tier are handled by the dog_ container class. Any requests for communications with the data tier  from the business rules tier  are also  handled by the dog_container class. Access to the data tier is only available from or through the business  rules tier. Access to the interface tier only occurs from or through the business rules tier.

The  current version of PHP includes many techniques to assist developers in validating users. This chapter looks  at one of the more simplistic methods.  Due to the nature of immediate verification of login credentials, the authentication process directly   accesses the data source for validation  it does not pass through the business rules tier . Thus, the  authentication process is considered a separate tier that is placed on top of the application to provide access.  As you will see, only minor changes need to occur in the interface tier programs to restrict access. Most of  the coding needed is placed in the authentication tier.  In addition to authentication, levels of access can also be determined during the sign-in process. Not   every user needs full access to an application. Some users may only need read access, some may need write  access to only the information that pertains to them, and some  administrators  may need full access to the  complete application. Each part of the application needs to be able to determine the correct level of access  without requesting additional information from the user  beyond the original login to the application .  Electronic supplementary material  The online version of this chapter  doi:10.1007 978-1-4842-1730-6_7   contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.    Steve Prettyman 2015  S. Prettyman, Learn PHP 7, DOI 10.1007 978-1-4842-1730-6_7  223   Chapter 7   authentiCation  One login process must allow the users to verify all portions of the application. Each portion of the   application needs access to common properties  such as user ID and password  that have been set by the  authentication tier for verification of valid access and valid levels of access. PHP provides the ability to store  information for an application in server memory by declaring a session. A session is considered to include  the complete interaction of the user with the application  such as the complete processes of transferring  money from a saving account to a checking account . A session can be established as soon as the user signs  in to the application. The session can be closed after the user logs out of the system  or the application times  out, or is closed . When a session is closed, all properties stored in the memory of the server are removed by  the garbage collector.  While the session is active, properties can be stored and shared throughout the application. Using this  process, the user ID and password can be stored in session properties. Each part of the application can then  verify that the user has logged in by determining if there are values in the userid and password properties. Before you look at the login authentication process, let’s look at how to determine if a user has logged   into the system. The examples in this chapter do not include verifications of security access levels. However,  the process to determine these levels would use similar code as shown in these examples.  Programming note—The session_start method call must be the first statement at the top  of the code. There must be no spaces or code between the <?php tag and session_start. The  session_start method produces an HTML header that would not be formed correctly if  any code exists before the method call.  <?php session_start  ; if   !isset $_SESSION['username']     !isset $_SESSION['password']    { echo "You must login to access the ABC Canine Shelter Reservation System"; echo " "; echo " Login    Create an account "; echo " "; } else { echo " Welcome back, " . $_SESSION['username'] . " "; } ?>  Each program in the interface tier  that the user can access  would include code similar to the previous   example. The session_start method, in this example, lets the operating system know that this program  is part of an existing session  which is declared in the authentication tier . Each session is identified by the  system using a uniquely generated ID. As long as the user  or system  has not closed the session, the session  ID will be attached to any program, called by the user, which includes the session_start method. This  allows the program to access all properties related to the current session.  The PHP isset method  in an if statement  can determine if values exist in the username and password  properties. If values do not exist, it indicates that the user has not been authenticated. Session properties are  retrieved  and set  using $_SESSION. In the previous example, if either of the properties is not set, the user is  provided links to the login page  login.php  or the register page  register.php . If both properties are set,  the user is welcomed to the system. The user has no choice but to log in to access the program. In addition,  as mentioned in previous chapters, for more secure programs, the IP address of the user’s machine, and the  calling program can be determined to provide extra assurance that the user is authorized.  224   Chapter 7   authentiCation  Example 7-1.  The lab.php file with user ID password verification  <?php session_start  ; if   !isset $_SESSION['username']     !isset $_SESSION['password']    { echo "You must login to access the ABC Canine Shelter Reservation System"; echo " "; echo " Login    Create an account "; echo " "; } else { echo " Welcome back, " . $_SESSION['username'] . " "; ?>        Dog Object          JS { display:none; }     function checkJS   { document.getElementById 'JS' .style.display = "inline"; }        Dog Object Creater       Please complete ALL fields. Please note the required format of information.

Please note the required format of information.  Enter Your Dog's Name  max 20 characters, alphabetic  <input type="text" pattern="[a-zA-Z ]*"  title="Up to 20 Alphabetic Characters" maxlength="20" name="dog_name" id="dog_name"  required >   Select Your Dog's Color:   Brown   Black   Yellow   White   Mixed   Enter Your Dog's Weight  numeric only  <input type="number" min="1" max="120" name="dog_ weight" id="dog_weight" required  >   Enter Your Dog's Breed  max 35 characters, alphabetic  <input type="text" pattern="[a-zA-Z ]*"   title="Up to 15 Alphabetic Characters" maxlength="35" name="dog_breed" id="dog_breed"  required  >                <?php } ?>  In Example 7-1, the verification code is placed at the top of the program. The else statement must   include all the code to execute if the user is signed into the system. Since the code for this program is HTML   and CSS  code, the if statement must be wrapped around the existing code. The closing bracket  s  of the  else statement is shifted to the bottom of the code  after all HTML tags .  PHP allows you to close your PHP code  via ?>  and reopen your PHP code  via <?php  as many times  as required. In this example, the PHP code is closed at the top of the program  in the else statement  just  before the closing bracket. The PHP code is then reopened at the bottom of the code to include a single  closing bracket, which closes the PHP else statement. This wraps the else statement around all the existing  code. The users can now only access this section of the code if they are logged in.  Since PHP code is now included in the lab program, the file ending must be changed from .html to   .php. Otherwise the server would not execute the PHP code.  Now let’s look at how you can populate the session properties by creating a login program. First let’s   look at the HTML to request information from the users.    Username: <input type="text" pattern=".{8,}" title="Userid must contain eight or more  characters." name="username" id="username" required >   226   Chapter 7   authentiCation  Password: <input type="password" pattern=" ?=.*\d  ?=.*[a-z]  ?=.*[A-Z] .{8,}"  title="Password must contain at least one number, one uppercase and lowercase letter, and at  least 8 total characters." name="password" id="password" required  >       HTML5 does not include a minimum length parameter. However, the pattern parameter can be used    with regular expressions  to establish a minimum size. In the username tag in the previous example, the  pattern ".{8,}" requires at least eight characters be entered by the users. For password security, a more  complicated pattern is needed. In the password example, in addition to the minimum requirement of  eight characters, at least one number  ?=.*\d , one uppercase letter  ?=.*[A-Z] , and one lowercase letter   ?=.*[a-z]  are required.  Security  and  performance—The  HTML  filtering  provided  is  used  to  inform  the  users  of  any typos that may have occurred. In the login process you are not storing information;  you are comparing information to what has already been stored. You don’t have to be  concerned with any possible harmful information being passed into the text boxes. Any  harmful information would not match the valid information that’s stored. The user would  receive an invalid user ID password message.     validate process not shown $_SESSION['username'] = $_POST['username']; $_SESSION['password'] = $_POST['password'];     Redirect the user to the home page header "Location: http:  www.asite.com lab.php" ;  Assuming you have validated the information against a list of valid user IDs and passwords  you will   look at that process soon , you can pass the valid user ID and password information into session variables.  Then the PHP header method can be used to redirect the application to the next program to execute  lab.php .  As long as lab.php includes the session_start method  as shown previously , it will have access to the  session variables.  <?php session_start  ; if   !isset $_POST['username']     !isset $_POST['password']    { ?>   Username: <input type="text" pattern=".{8,}" title="Userid must contain eight or more  characters." name="username" id="username" required >  Password: <input type="password" pattern=" ?=.*\d  ?=.*[a-z]  ?=.*[A-Z] .{8,}"  title="Password must contain at least one number, one uppercase and lowercase letter,   and at least 8 total characters."  name="password" id="password" required  >      <?php } else {    validate process not shown   $_SESSION['username'] = $_POST['username'];   $_SESSION['password'] = $_POST['password'];  227   Chapter 7   authentiCation       Redirect the user to the home page   header "Location: http:  www.asite.com lab.php" ;   } ?>  Putting the pieces together requires an if statement to determine if the user has entered the user ID  and password. If the user has not done so, the HTML code to request them is displayed. If the information  has been entered  and is valid using the HTML5 pattern expressions shown  the else portion of the  statement will execute  storing the values in the session variables and calling the lab.php program . This  provides you with the basic shell of accepting the user ID and password, verifying they exist, and calling the  program in the interface tier if they do exist. Of course, you need to authenticate the user ID and password  before calling the program.  Programming note—The server variables PHP_AUTH_USER and PHP_AUTH_PW can be used for  user ID and password validation, instead of using session variables.  header 'WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="ABC Canine"' ;     header 'HTTP 1.0 401 Unauthorized' ;  Unauthorized  header  messages  can  be  created  if  the  user  has  not  entered  a  user  ID  password or a valid user ID password. This will automatically cause the system to request  the  user  enter  a  user  ID password.  This  technique  is  pretty  straightforward.  However,  there have been some reports, in the past, of browsers not functioning properly with this  technique. Besides, creating your own technique allows you to design the login screen with  the same style as the rest of your web site.  For more information, visit: http:  php.net manual en features.http-auth.php  $valid_useridpasswords = array  "sjohnson" => "N3working" ; $valid_userids = array_keys $valid_useridpasswords ; $userid = $_SESSION['username']; $password = $_SESSION['password']; $valid =  in_array $userid, $valid_userids   &&  $password == $valid_useridpasswords[$userid] ; If $valid  { header "Location: http:  www.asite.com lab.php" ;}  There are several ways you can authenticate user IDs and passwords. If you are creating a system  that does not require user IDs and passwords to change, you could use arrays. In the previous example  the $valid_useridpasswords associate array contains the combination of valid user IDs and passwords.  The PHP method array_keys places all keys  in this example the user IDs  into a separate array  $valid_ userids . After the session variables have been placed in $userid and $password, the PHP in_array method  is used to determine if the correct combination of user ID and password exists. in_array determines if the  user ID exists in the array. Then the user ID is used as the subscript to pull the password from the valid_ useridpasswords array and compare it to the value in $password. If the user ID exists and the passwords  are the same, then everything is valid. $valid will contain TRUE. If either  or both  are not valid, $valid will  contain FALSE. If $valid is TRUE, the application redirects to the lab.php program.  Technically properties in a session are secured from any access outside the session. However, there   have been reported instances, in the past, of hacker programs breaking this security and accessing session  information. If the user ID and password, in this example, are stored in session variables and passed across  the Internet to another program, hackers might gain access to the information.  228   Chapter 7   authentiCation  If the user ID and password are externally stored in a file or database, the information will also travel   outside the program. The program will no longer have control over the security of these items once they  reside in the file or database. This could allow hackers access to the information. Security, as mentioned, has  to be a team effort among the programmer, data administrator, and network administrator.  It is common practice to encrypt the password to reduce the chance that hackers will discover the  authentication information  or any other secure information . Many PHP books demonstrate the use of  the MD5 hash technique. However, over the last several years vulnerabilities have been discovered in this  encyption style.  PHP 5.5 included the method password_hash, which will be adjusted over time to use the most secure   encyption hashing techniques avaliable.  Programming note—Caution should be used when storing the encrypted version of the  password.  The  size  of  the  resulting  encryption  will  increase  with  new  hash  versions.  A size of 255 characters is likely to be large enough for the many years. The number of  milliseconds  needed  for  this  hash  increases  with  the  size  and  type  of  the  encryption.  Advanced programmers may want to do some testing on their servers for time costs.  Visit http:  php.net manual en function.password-hash.php for more information.  Programming  note—You  cannot  do  a  simple  comparison  with  the  hashed  password  created by PHP’s password_hash method. The hash produced includes the encryption type,  a salt value, and the hashed password.  You only need to replace one line of code in the example to verify the password. You can replace  $valid =   in_array $userid, $valid_userids   &&  $password == $valid_useridpasswords[$userid]  ;  with  $valid =   in_array $userid, $valid_userids   &&  password_verify $password,   $valid_useridpasswords[$userid]  ;  If you placed the encypted password in the $valid_useridpasswords array, the validation technique   would not require any other changes. The PHP password_verify method will encrpt the password provided  by the user and compare it to the existing encyrpted password. If they match, it will return TRUE.  When using XML or JSON files, you can use the same logic used in the constructor for the dogdata.php  program from Chapter 6, to retrieve the valid user ID and password information. The only changes needed  are to the if statement, which determines the location of the user ID and password file, and to the last line in  the constructor to place the array produced to $valid_useridpasswords instead of dogs_array.       Fredfred   $2y$10$VosI32FejL.bOMaCjGbBp.Jre6Ipa.tLYQrVqj9kiVpef5zZ25qQK       Petepete   $2y$10$FdbXxIVXmVOHtaBNxB8vzupRBJFCqUyOTJXrlpNdrL0HKQ U.jFHO       229   Chapter 7   authentiCation  to retrieve the information.  Assuming the XML is in a similar format as the dog data XML file  as shown , you can use similar logic   $valid_useridpasswords = json_decode $json,TRUE ; $userid = $_POST['username']; $password = $_POST['password'];     foreach $valid_useridpasswords as $users  {         foreach $users as $user          {             $hash = $user['password'];         if  in_array $userid, $user   &&  password_verify $password,$hash            {                 $_SESSION['username'] = $userid;                 $_SESSION['password'] = $hash;                 header "Location: lab.php" ;         } }  The array created using the json_decode method is in a similar format to the array created from the  dog_data XML file. It requires two foreach loops, one to loop through the “users” array, and the other to  loop through the “user” arrays. The in_array method can then be used to determine if the user ID exists  in the user array. If it does, the password is compared to the hashed password using the PHP method  password_verify. This method uses the first part of the hashed password to retrieve the information on the  encryption technique and the salt value. The salt value is an automatically generated value that is used to  produce the hashed password. If the passwords match, the user ID and hashed password  $hash  are saved  as session variables. The main program is then called  see Example 7-1 .   in php 5.5, you could adjust the salt value. in php 7, this option was depreciated as it was deemed      Note  an unnecessary use of system resources.

The userid and password JSON data would also need to be formatted as shown.  {"user": [ {"userid":"Fredfred","password":"$2y$10$VosI32FejL.bOMaCjGbBp.Jre6Ipa.tLYQrVqj9kiVpef5zZ25qQK"}, {"userid":"Petepete","password":"$2y$10$FdbXxIVXmVOHtaBNxB8vzupRBJFCqUyOTJXrlpNdrL0HKQ\ U.jFHO"} ] }  MySQL Data  It is more common and usually more secure to store user ID and password information in a database.  Databases can be secured using user IDs and passwords, which can also include levels of access  read only,  read, and write  to the information. Even with this level of security, the password should still be encrypted. Very few minor changes are needed to the MySQL constructor example from Chapter 6 to accomplish   authentication.  $mysqli =mysqli_connect $server, $db_username, $db_password, $database ;   if  mysqli_connect_errno      {           throw new Exception "MySQL connection error: " . mysqli_connect_error   ;   }   $sql="SELECT * FROM Users";    Change the table used $result=mysqli_query $con,$sql ;   If $result===null  {         throw new Exception "No records retrieved from Database" ; }   $valid_useridpasswords = mysqli_fetch_assoc $result ;    change the array used   mysqli_free_result $result ;   mysqli_close $con ;  232   This example code will pull the information from a table in the database  Users  and place the   information in an associate array  via the mysqli_fetch_assoc method . If the fields in the table are the  same as the tag names from the XML file  userid and password , the associate array built will be similar to  the array built using the code from Example 7-2. All previous code "   ...... code to verify userid  and password ...." is replaced by the code shown here. No code below the statement should need  adjusting.  Chapter 7   authentiCation  Do It          1.  Create a conversion program to determine the encrypted version of a password   using the PHP method password_hash  see http:  php.net manual en  function.password-hash.php .  2.  Download the example files from this section. Add XML records to the uidpass   file that could be used for access permissions  read only or read write  and levels   user or administrator . Test to verify that the new uidpass file works correctly  with the existing code. Make any necessary code changes to make it compatible.  3.  Download the example files from this section. Add code to the program to limit   attempts to log in with a bad password to three. Record any invalid attempt to log  in  after three tries  in the user log.  Registration  In addition to authorizing user logons, most systems allow the users to create their own user IDs and  passwords. By default, the self-created IDs are given the lowest priorities. An administrator can then go in  and increase the level of privileges once the ID has been created. Some sites allow non-registered users   users who are not logged in .  Non-registered users should only be given read-only access to non-privileged information. Non-  registered users are much more of a security risk because it would be difficult to determine their identity  during a security breach. PHP provides the ability to retrieve the user’s IP address using $_SERVER['REMOTE_ ADDR']. This might provide some ability to trace the user. However, many users use free public access points,  which generate random IP addresses. If the one of these points is used, it will be much more difficult to track  them down.  In addition, providing the opportunity for users to create user IDs and passwords allows the program to  gather additional information  such as name and e-mail  that can help with security, and also provide easy  ability to promote the web site to users of the site. The success rate of selling what is offered on the site will  be much higher to customers who are already familiar with the site. To encourage users to create user IDs  and passwords, the site should offer them some benefit  such as access to the help desk  that is not available  to visitors.  The registration page will, in many ways, work similarly to the login page. However, any valid user ID  or password entered will be stored  instead of compared . Because the application will be updating the list  of valid IDs, the application must validate the information before it is updated. You can use some of the  techniques that you used previously when validating the dog class properties. First, as the user enters a user  ID and password  which must pass the HTML5 validation shown previously , it is passed to a PHP program.  Even though it is considered to be secure inside a session, the information will travel from the HTML form to  the PHP code. The information should be validated again.  233   Chapter 7   authentiCation  if   isset $_POST['username']     isset $_POST['password']    { $userid = $_POST['username']; $password = $_POST['password']; if  ! preg_match " ^.* ?=.{8,}  ?=.*\d  ?=.*[a-z]  ?=.*[A-Z] .*$ ", $password      ! strlen $userid  >= 8    {         throw new Exception "Invalid Userid and or Password Format" ; } else  This if statement uses the PHP function preg_match to determine if the format of the password   contains one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and at least eight characters. Notice that  the regular expression format is the same as used with the HTML5 code  the order of the expression has  changed, but it still contains the same information . The PHP strlen method also checks the user ID to  determine that it has eight or more characters.  If either validation does not pass, the program raises an Exception. If both pass, the else part of the   statement executes to encrypt the password and store the information.  $password = password_hash $password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT ; $input = file_get_contents $dog_data_xml ; $find = " "; $newupstring = " \n " . $userid . " \n " . $password; $newupstring .= " \n \n "; $find = preg_quote $find,' ' ; $output = preg_replace " ^$find \n\$  m","",$input ; $output = $output . $newupstring; file_put_contents $dog_data_xml,$output ; $login_string = date 'mdYhis'  . "  New Userid  " . $userid . "\n"; error_log $login_string,3,$user_log_file ; header "Location: e7login.php" ;  Before inserting the password into the XML file, it must be encyrpted  hashed . The PHP method   password_hash will convert the password to the format shown previously.  Programming  note—password_hash  has  many  different  options  and  configurations  available for the advanced developer. For more information,  visit http:  php.net manual en function.password-hash.php.  file_get_contents dumps the contents of the XML user ID password file into $input. preg_quote   will place backslashes next to any special characters in $find  such as the backslash contained in  users  to  keep PHP from trying to interpret those characters as part of a regular expression. preg_replace will use the  regular expression  ^$find \n\$  m to search for   with and without  \n  at the end. Since records  in files are determined by the newline character, this will ensure that you find   at either the end of a  line in the file or as part of a line in the file. When   is found in the file  the contents of the file are in  $input , it is replaced by ""  empty string . preg_replace will also attempt to place backslashes in any string  existing in the second parameter  where the "" is currently located . If the $newupstring is placed in that  parameter, the encrypted password would be modified by preg_replace. This would cause the passwords to  not verify, even if the one entered by the user is correct.  234   Chapter 7   authentiCation  Therefore, the contents of $newupstring  the new user info  are appended to $output. The $output   string is then used to replace all contents of the user ID password XML file. Once this information has  been saved successfully, the user log is updated to indicate the creation of a new user ID, and the user is  redirected to the login screen to sign in to the application with the new user ID and password.  Alternatively, the previous process of loading the file into an associative array, updating the associative  array, and then loading the associate array back into the XML file could have been used. However, it would  have taken more code and is unnecessary because this process is only used once in the application. The  program will not make multiple attempts to update the user ID and password file with the same user.  Example 7-3.  The registration.php file  <?php session_start  ; $user_log_file = "user.log"; try { if   isset $_POST['username']     isset $_POST['password']    { $userid = $_POST['username']; $password = $_POST['password']; if  ! preg_match " ^.* ?=.{8,}  ?=.*\d  ?=.*[a-z]  ?=.*[A-Z] .*$ ", $password      ! strlen $userid  >= 8    { throw new Exception "Invalid Userid and or Password Format" ;  } else {         libxml:use_internal_errors true ;         $xmlDoc = new DOMDocument  ;         if   file_exists "e7dog_applications.xml"            {         $xmlDoc->load  'e7dog_applications.xml'  ;         $searchNode = $xmlDoc->getElementsByTagName  "type"  ;                 foreach  $searchNode as $searchNode                   {                         $valueID = $searchNode->getAttribute 'ID' ;                               if $valueID == "UIDPASS"                          {                         $xmlLocation = $searchNode->getElementsByTagName  "location"  ;                         $dog_data_xml = $xmlLocation->item 0 ->nodeValue;                         break;                         }                 }         }         else         {                 throw new Exception "Dog applications xml file missing or corrupt" ;         } } else {         throw new Exception "Dog applications xml file missing or corrupt" ;         }  235   Chapter 7   authentiCation          $password = password_hash $password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT ;         $input = file_get_contents $dog_data_xml ;         $find = " ";          $newupstring = " \n " . $userid .

The $newupstring value can also be changed to:  $newupstring = ',{"userid":"' . $userid . '","password":"' . $password . '"}\n]}';  These two changes  along with the previous changes  would update a JSON file with a new    user ID password combination.  236   Chapter 7   authentiCation  MySQL Data  MySQL would require a few more changes. After the password is encyrpted using password_hash, the  database can be opened, the record inserted, and then the database can be closed.  $password = password_hash $password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT ; $mysqli =mysqli_connect $server, $db_username, $db_password, $database ;   if  mysqli_connect_errno      {           throw new Exception "MySQL connection error: " . mysqli_connect_error   ;   }   $sql="INSERT INTO Users  userid, password  VALUES '" . $userid . "','" . $password . "' ;"; $result=mysqli_query $con,$sql ; If $result===null  {            throw new Exception "Userid Password not added to Database" ; } mysqli_close $con ; $login_string = date 'mdYhis'  . "  New Userid  " . $userid . "\n"; error_log $login_string,3,$user_log_file ; header "Location: e7login.php" ;  Logging In  In addition to providing the users with the ability to create their own user IDs and passwords, an application  should also provide them the ability to change their passwords. The ability to provide a date limit to expire  passwords is very beneficial to increase security. Everytime the user logs on, a comparision can be made on  this value. If the current date is more than xx days older than the date saved, the user would be required to  change the password.  Since password sniffer programs will try to guess passwords, it is also a good idea to limit to the number  of attempts to sign in with the right user ID and password combination. This would reduce the chances that  a password sniffing program could generate the correct combination. It is important not allow a valid signin  for a period of time after the maximum amount of attempts have been made. Even though this is frustrating  to the user, it reduces the chances that a password sniffing program would discover the right combination.  If the program does not know that the attempts have timed out, it will receive invalid user ID password  messages, even if it guessed the right combination during the timeout period. These adjustments will require  additional fields to the user ID password file  or database .

" \n " . $hashed_password .  " \n"; $newupstring .= " " . date 'Y-m-d', strtotime '+30 days'   . " \n"; $newupstring .= " 0 \n " . date 'mdYhis'  . " \n"; $newupstring .= " " . date 'mdYhis'  . " \n \n ";  The PHP method strtotime will parse any standard date and time format and attempt to convert it   to the UNIX date time format  which PHP uses . In this example, the method provides the ability to add 30  days to the current date, which in turn will be used to determine if a password has expired. Alternatively, an  expired date  such as the day before the current date  could be placed in this field when user IDs are created  in bulk  such as populating student IDs in a course management system . This would force the users to  change the password the first time they sign in to the system. The expire date is stored in datestamp for use  when the user logs in to the system.  The attempts tag, in the example, will record how many times the user tries to sign in with a bad user  ID password combination  reset to zero when a valid login occurs . If the date and time in lastattempt are  in five minutes, and the value of attempts is 3 or greater, the user must wait until more than five minutes  has expired since the last attempt to log in. As with most login systems, even if the user logs in with valid  information, the last invalid login must be five or more minutes ago. The last valid login date and time is  also recorded in the validattempt tags. Although this is not used for authentication in this example, it is  important to keep track of all valid logins.  To keep the code as simple as possible in the main section of the program, the code that looks up the  location of the user ID and password file has been moved to the method retrieve_useridpasswordfile.  Saving the data in the XML file has also been moved to the method saveupfile. No changes  except for the  addition of more XML tags as mentioned previously  have occurred in the code for these methods.  Example 7-4.  The login.php file with password timeout and three tries timeout  <?php session_start  ; $user_log_file = "user.log"; $passed = FALSE; function saveupfile $dog_data_xml,$valid_useridpasswords  { $xmlstring = ' ';            $xmlstring .= "\n \n";          foreach $valid_useridpasswords as $users          {         foreach $users as $user   238   Chapter 7   authentiCation          {         $xmlstring .=" \n " . $user['userid'] .

If the current date time is more than 30 days beyond the value in datestamp, the password change   changepassword  program is called. The next if statement determines if the user has had fewer than three  invalid attempts to log in, and it has been more than five minutes since the last attempt. If this is the case, the  PHP method password_verify will compare the password entered by the user with the password contained  in the XML file. If the passwords match, the validattempts value will be updated with the date time, the  attempts will be reset to 0, and the user ID and password will be saved in session variables. The changes to  the XML file are then saved. In addition, the user login is recorded in the log file. If the passwords do not  match, the lastattempt value is updated with the current date time.  Since a valid login or an expired password will cause the application to redirect to a different program   with the PHP header method, the program will only drop to the last if statement if the user ID and  password combo is not valid, or if there have been too many attempts in five minutes. When this occurs,  the "invalid  password" message is displayed, and the number of attempts is increased by 1. The changes  to the XML file are then saved. The program will then continue to display the user ID and password boxes  with the "invalid userid password" message. As noted, even a valid user ID password combo that’s has  been entered in five minutes or three or more invalid entries  sequentially  is rejected.  241   Chapter 7   authentiCation  JSON Data  JSON data would require some changes to accommodate the additional fields.  {"user":[ {"userid":"Fredfred","password":"$2y$10$VosI32FejL.bOMaCjGbBp.Jre6Ipa.tLYQrVqj9kiVpef5zZ25qQK",  "datestamp":"2015-09-03","attempts":"0","lastattempt":"08052015044229","validattempt":  "08052015045431"}, {"userid":"Poppoppop","password":"$2y$10$C1jXhTl0myamuLKhZxK5m.4X4TVcdeFbeLSBIA7l4fx6tUnC8vrg6",  "datestamp":"2015-09-04","attempts":"2","lastattempt":"08062015011347","validattempt":  "08062015113038"} ]}  The $newupstring would also require changes due to these new fields. The location of some of the code   would also move to methods, as mentioned earlier.  $newupstring = ',{"userid":"' . $user['userid'] . '","password":"' . $user['password'] . '","'; $newupstring .= 'datestamp":"' . $user['datestamp'] . '","attempts":"' . $user['attempts'] . "',"'; $newupstring .= 'lastattempt":"' . $user['lastattempt'] . '","validattempt":"' .  $user['validattempt'] .'"';  $newupstring .= '"}\n]}';  MySQL Data  MySQL login code requires the UPDATE statement  instead of an INSERT statement, as seen in the registration  code  to update any fields that have changed. In addition, the clean_input method from Chapter 4 should  to be used to remove any harmful PHP and SQL statements from the userid field. This will help reduce  the chance of SQL injection occuring, which could cause the SQL statement to change more than just the  required fields and record s . For example, if the $user['userid'] field contained '*', all records would be  updated instead of just one record with a valid user ID.  The user ID could also be validated as existing in the database before executing the UPDATE statement.   This  assuming all data in the database is valid  would also reduce the chance of harmful changes.  In the following example, all possible files are updated at once. Alternatively, only those fields that   change could be updated when needed. However this would require more code and not necessarily be any  more efficient. Also, if the user ID is not validated as existing in the database beforehand, the SQL statement  will automatically not update the fields if userid is not in the database.  $userid = clean_input $user['userid'] ; $sql ="UPDATE Users SET datestamp='" . $user['datestamp'] . "',attempts='"; $sql .=$user['attempts'] . "',lastattempt='" . $user['lastattempt'] . "',"; $sql .="validattempt='" . $user['validattempt'] . "'  WHERE userid='" . $userid . "';";  Notice that the UPDATE code does not include the password field in the WHERE statement. In this   example, some fields would be updated when the password is not valid, and some would be updated when  the password is valid. If the SQL statement is broken into multiple statements  at least one for valid user  ID password and one for not valid user password , then the WHERE statement for the valid information can  include both the user ID and password, and the statement for non-valid information can just include the  password. An example of a complete login, registration, and password-change application using a MySQL  database is included on the book’s web site under Chapter 7.  242   Chapter 7   authentiCation  Change Password  The process to change a password will require verification of the current password and then saving the  new password. It will also require updating the date contained in the datestamp tag from the XML file. The  program code is very similar to the login program.  $userid = $_POST['username']; $npassword = $_POST['password']; $newpassword = password_hash $npassword, PASSWORD_DEFAULT ; $password = $_POST['oldpassword']; $datestamp = date 'Y-m-d', strtotime '+30 days'  ; $I = 0; $passed = FALSE;    First a few properties are set for the userid, new userid, and the new datestamp. $hash = $user['password']; if password_verify $password,$hash   { $passed = TRUE;         $valid_useridpasswords['user'][$I]['password'] = $newpassword;         $valid_useridpasswords['user'][$I]['datestamp'] = $datestamp;         $valid_useridpasswords['user'][$I]['attempts'] = 0;         saveupfile $dog_data_xml,$valid_useridpasswords ;    save changes before header call         $login_string = date 'mdYhis'  . "  Password Changed  " . $userid . "\n";         error_log $login_string,3,$user_log_file ;         header "Location: e7logina.php" ; } else { $valid_useridpasswords['user'][$I]['lastattempt'] = date 'mdYhis' ;    last attempted login }  If the user ID and old password are authenticated correctly then the new password, datestamp, and  attempts properties are changed and updated in the XML file. Also an entry is placed in the log file. If the  password is not verified, an "invalid userid password" message is displayed.  Example 7-5.  The changepassword.php file  <?php session_start  ; $user_log_file = "user.log"; function saveupfile $dog_data_xml,$valid_useridpasswords  { $xmlstring = ' ';     $xmlstring .= "\n \n";          foreach $valid_useridpasswords as $users          {         foreach $users as $user          {         $xmlstring .=" \n " . $user['userid'] .

A verification of the proper  user ID and password entries in the PHP code has not been included in the example. Since the information  is traveling over the Internet from the form to the PHP program, the user ID and password should also be  verified in the PHP program. That coding is left as an exercise for this section.  The only changes needed for the change password program to work with JSON data are indicated in the  previous JSON sections of this chapter.  The UPDATE SQL statement needs to “set” the password property in the same structure as the other fields that  were changed in the previous MySQL section. A complete authentication program using MySQL is included  under Chapter 7 on the book’s web site.  1.  Copy the example files for this section from the book’s web site. Adjust the   change password program to include PHP code that verifies the correct format of  the user ID, password, and new password.  2.  Copy the example files for this chapter from the book’s web site. Adjust the   registration program to check for a duplicate user ID before attempting to insert a  new user ID password combination. Hint: This can be done using the in_array  method. If the user ID exists, display a message back to the users.  3.  Copy the example files for this section from the book’s web site. Adjust the   programs necessary to require the users to also enter their name, phone, and  e-mail when registering. Also make sure to change the other programs to keep  this information valid.

Short Answer Essay  1.  Explain the techniques that can be used to reduce the chances that a password   sniffing program can discover the correct user ID and password combination.  2.  Explain how sessions work. Include an explanation on how they can help secure   an application with user ID and password authentication.  3.  What is SQL injection? How can it be avoided?  4.  Why should passwords be encrypted? Explore the Internet and discover the latest   versions of encryption. Does the most current version of PHP use the newest  version of encryption?  Projects  1.  Download log maintenance files from Chapter 6 or use your own maintenance   files that you created from Chapter 6. Use the techniques shown in this chapter to  secure these files with user ID and password authentication.  2.  Download the files from this chapter. Update the files and programs so users   can request their passwords. A temporary password  new field in the XML file   must randomly be created  use rand  and e-mailed to the users. The password  should have a quick expiration  one day or less . The user must be able to verify  other information entered via the registration page  security question, or other  personal info  to request the password. If the user signs in correctly with the  temporary password, the system should make the user change the password.  1.  Update the ABC Computer Parts Inventory application to include user ID and   password authentication as shown in this chapter. Be sure to secure any log  maintenance programs related to the application.

The  current version of the system allows the users to insert only one dog before requiring the them to log in  again to insert additional dogs. Also, the system does not allow users to update or delete dog information  that exists in the system. You have already completed most of the PHP code necessary to provide update  and delete ability in Chapter 6  data objects . You now need to attach this portion of the data object   dog_data  to the business rules tier  dog . In addition you need to make some changes to the interface tier   dog_interface and lab  to call the update and delete methods and display the results. Most of the coding  needed  as you will soon see  will take place in the lab.php file. So you will start with those changes.  Data Handling Using JavaScript  The current lab.php file allows users to enter only dog information that will be inserted into the data storage   XML, JSON, or MySQL . The interface needs to be modified to allow users to indicate what activity they  would like to accomplish  Insert, Update, or Delete . It also needs to allow users to pick a current dog if the  process involves updating or deletion. This should, hopefully, indicate that you will need a list box that is  populated with information on the dogs currently located in the shelter.  Electronic supplementary material  The online version of this chapter  doi:10.1007 978-1-4842-1730-6_8   contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.  249    Steve Prettyman 2015  S. Prettyman, Learn PHP 7, DOI 10.1007 978-1-4842-1730-6_8   Chapter 8   MultifunCtional interfaCes  You will look at the PHP changes necessary in later sections of this chapter. For now, let’s assume that   dog_interface  interface tier  will return this information, which was retrieved from dog_data  data tier  via  the dog methods  business rules tier . You will also assume that similar coding to the dog_breeds program   Chapter 4  will be created to produce a dogs list box.  In addition, lab.php needs access to all the information from a particular dog that has been selected.  The code will need to place all the information in the dog_name and dog_weight text boxes, the dog_breeds  list box, and the dog_color radio buttons. You could accomplish this task in two ways. One is to allow the  users to select the dog from the list box and then recall the dog_interface program to request the particular  dog from the dog class, which in turn will request the information from the dog_data class. However, this  is requiring an additional, unnecessary, call across the Internet to request the information. Instead, you  can gather all the necessary information  dog_breed list box information, dogs list box information, and  complete information of all dogs in the current data storage  when the user first calls the lab.php interface.  You can use the current JavaScript AJAX code  Chapter 4  with just a couple of changes to retrieve all the  necessary information.  You must make sure that the user indicates what type of operation is requested  at least if it is an insert   or change delete  before you populate the form objects  text boxes, list box, and radio button . You can  accomplish this by not displaying the form objects until a selection has been made. You can make a slight  adjustment to the combination of JavaScript code and CSS code, used in Chapter 4, to require the users to  select from a dogs list box before the form is displayed.     Note   the process you are about to look at is a very common practice used in web applications. Many web  applications return data in an array, Json, or XMl format. the interface  in this example, lab.php  then can use  Javascript to retrieve the information needed.   Programming note—Shopping carts use a similar technique. As the customers select items  to purchase, the items are placed in a data object  probably a JSON object  on the client  machine. When the customer begins the process of checking out, the data is transferred to  the server. This allows the customer to make changes that will not cause additional calls to  the server. Since the purchase information is not considered a security risk, this is usually a  safe procedure. Of course, this would not be a good way to handle credit card information.  Using the format shown in Figure 8-1, the user is forced to select NEW or a dog from list box before   proceeding. Once the user has made a choice, the HTML form can be displayed with the default values  for  an insert  or the current values for the dog selected. CSS code will initially turn the display of the buttons   and the form  to "none". JavaScript code  which you will look at soon  will change the display of the correct  button s  and the form to "inline" to display at the proper time.  250   Figure 8-1.  The lab.php file with dogs list box  Figure 8-2 demonstrates the results when the user selects NEW. The same defaults are provided as  shown in previous chapters. The only visual change is the text of the input button. The weakness of this  approach occurs when the users do not have JavaScript enabled. For this example, if JavaScript is not  enabled, you will require that all information be entered. You could request the individual dog information  from the dog_data class  via the Dog class . While this approach is not as efficient as the JavaScript approach  you are about to use, it is more customer friendly than requiring the entry of all the information.  Chapter 8   MultifunCtional interfaCes  251   Chapter 8   MultifunCtional interfaCes  Figure 8-2.  The lab.php file with NEW selected  Figure 8-3 displays the results when an existing dog has been selected. The list box displays the dog’s   name and its breed  to make it as unique as possible . In addition a dog ID could have also been provided to  identify the particular dog. When the dog is selected, the dog information  dog_name, dog_color, dog_weight,  and dog_breed  is populated into the form. The users then can update or delete the dog information.  252   Chapter 8   MultifunCtional interfaCes  Figure 8-3.  The lab.php file with a dog selected     Note   as mentioned in previous chapters, the code provided in this example does not restrict duplicate  entries. thus, in a live environment, an additional field  dog iD  will need to be used to make the dogs unique.  253   Chapter 8   MultifunCtional interfaCes  Previously when an insert occurred, the system would display a message to indicate the change was  successful. The user was then required to reload the lab.php file if another change was required. You can   fix this problem by having the dog_interface program set a session property with the message to be  returned. The dog_interface can then call the lab.php file, which in turn can check to see if there is a  message to be displayed.  Figure 8-4.  The lab.php file handling message from dog_interface  You will use a combination of PHP code, JavaScript code, and CSS code to create the desired results.   Let’s break it down.  <?php session_start  ; if   !isset $_SESSION['username']     !isset $_SESSION['password']    {     echo "You must login to access the ABC Canine Shelter Reservation System";     echo " ";     echo " Login    Create an account ";     echo " "; } else if  $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'] == 'http:  127.0.0.1:8080 mysite bgchapter8 ExampleFile8  e8login.php'    $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'] == 'http:  127.0.0.1:8080 mysite bgchapter8  ExampleFile8 e8lab.php'   { if  isset $_SESSION['message']   {     echo $_SESSION['message']; } else {     echo " Welcome back, " . $_SESSION['username'] . " "; } ?>  254   Chapter 8   MultifunCtional interfaCes  The PHP code at the top of the lab program will now include an additional check to determine if a   message has been returned. While the if part of the statement will not require any changes, the else part  has a few additional changes. Note that the new if statement checks to see if the lab program has been  called by itself. The $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'] method returns lab.php as the calling program when  dog_interface uses the header method to recall lab.php. In addition, the same if statement also checks to  see if login.php has called lab. These are now the only two legitimate calls than can be made to the lab.php  program.  Another if statement in the else block checks to see if a $_SESSION['message'] has been returned  by using the isset method. If it has been returned, then lab.php was called by dog_interface, because  login does not return a $_SESSION['message']. The lab program now displays the message. If there is no  $_SESSION['message'], the welcome message is displayed.  Let’s now jump to the HTML code in lab.php. Then you’ll take a look at the CSS and JavaScript code.     ABC Canine Shelter Reservation System      AjaxRequest 'e8dog_interface.php' ;    Pick the dog name and breed to change from the dropdown box, then click the  button. For new dog information select 'NEW'.  Select 'NEW' or Dog's Name Breed    <input type="button" name="selected" id="selected" value="Click to select" onclick="process_ select  "  >        Please note the required format of information.

An HTML  button  not a Submit button  follows. When clicked, it will cause a JavaScript function  process_select  to  execute. Another div tag has been added which contains the HTML form. This form is to be hidden until the  user clicks the button.  CSS code  input_form { display:none; }  is included at the top of the program to keep the form from   displaying. Additional CSS code also keeps the buttons from displaying. This code is very similar to the CSS  code to keep the non-JS form from displaying if the user does not have JavaScript activated in the browser.  At the bottom of the form, a hidden property  index  has been created to hold the index  from the dogs  array  of the dog selected. The initial value is set to -1. This property will be changed when the user selects a  dog. The original Submit button is replaced by three Submit buttons  one for insert, one for delete, and one  for update . Whichever button is clicked will cause a property to be created  insert, delete, or update  and  set to a value. The property name is the ID of the button, and the contents in the property are the contents  of the value attribute of the button selected. This will help dog_interface determine which type of changes  the user is requesting. These buttons are also included on the non-JavaScript enabled form. Remember,  in this example, non-JavaScript enabled browsers will be require users to enter all information needed to  successfully accomplish an insert, delete, or update.  Hopefully, the changes you just looked at are pretty understandable. You are now going to look at some  JavaScript code to handle this data. As mentioned, the manipulation of data by JavaScript is a common task  in web applications. While this is not a JavaScript book, it is important that any web applications developer  be familiar with JavaScript. I think you will see that the structure of the JavaScript language is similar to the  structure of the PHP language.  First you will look at the changes to the get_breeds.js file  from Chapter 4 . The file is renamed to   getlists.js to reflect that it will now handle the getBreeds and dogs list boxes.  function HandleResponse response  {         var responsevalues = response.split '' ;         document.getElementById 'AjaxResponse' .innerHTML = responsevalues[0];         document.getElementById 'AjaxReturnValue' .innerHTML = responsevalues[1];         obj = JSON.parse responsevalues[2] ; }  All the code changes are in the HandleResponse method of the JavaScript file. Previously the values in  the response property  passed to the method  were directly passed into the div tag with the AjaxResponse  ID. At that point, only the list box code for the breeds was returned. Now the method will accept three types  of information  the breeds list box, the dogs list box, and the dogs array . To reduce the number of calls  to the web server, one AJAX call is made. It returns all the information into the response property. The  information will be separated by using the pipeline    symbol. Soon you will see that the formation of this  string will occur in the dog_interface program.  You will need to break the data in a similar way that you broke previous data using the PHP explode   method. In JavaScript, the split method will break a string into an array using a parameter provided   . In  the example, this will create the array responsevalues. var creates this array as local to the method. It will be  destroyed, because it will no longer be needed, when the method closes  hits the } symbol . The array now  has three rows. The first row  [0]  contains the getBreeds list box code. The second row  [1]  contains the  dogs list box code. The third row  I bet you guessed that one  contains the complete dogs array.  256   Chapter 8   MultifunCtional interfaCes  Security and performance—In this application, the dogs information is not highly sensitive.  Also,  the  information  is  displayed  to  the  users.  This  allows  the  users  to  see  and  fix  any  data that might have been corrupted. For more sensitive information, the array should be  declared using var to keep the data accessable only to the current method  function .  The subscripts  0, 1, and 2  can now be used to pull each part of the array and release it to the proper  place. responsevalues[0] is placed in AjaxResponse to display the getBreeds list. responsevalues[1] is  placed in AjaxReturnValue to display the dogs list box. The dogs array, since you won’t know yet which dog  the user has selected, will be placed in a JSON object  obj . As you have seen, JSON data includes named  indexes and values, which are very similar to associate arrays in PHP. The var statement is not used because  this object must be public and available to the complete application.  If you remember from previous chapters, arrays cannot be directly formatted into strings. Arrays    must be serialized. However, JSON data can also be passed in a string. You will soon see that the “array”   in responsevalues[3] has been formatted as JSON data by the dog_interface program. JavaScript’s   JSON.parse method has the ability to look at data and, if it is valid, transform it into a JSON object. This is  very similar to the PHP method json_encode.  Now let’s look at how you can populate the form when the user picks a dog from the dogs list box. The JavaScript method process_select  called by the HTML button after the user picks from the dogs list    has been placed at the top of the code in the lab.php file. It could have also been placed in its own JS file and  imported in the same way as the getlists.js file. This new method use the information contained in OBJ    the JSON dogs object containing all the dogs  to populate the text boxes  dog_name and dog_weight , radio  buttons  dog_color , and list box  dog_breed  with the information for the dog the user selects in the list box.  function process_select   {          var colorbuttons = document.getElementsByName 'dog_color' ;  First, all the color values from the radio buttons will be pulled from the HTML form and placed into an  array called colorbuttons using the JavaScript method getElementsByName. dog_color  the name of each  radio button  is passed into the method. This process will create an array of the radio buttons with the same  indexes as the radio button subscripts for the color. For instance, the 0 position of the array will now contain  brown, which is the first radio button displayed in the HTML form. This will allow you to set the proper color  radio button by referencing its position  such as colorbuttons[0] to set brown .  if ! document.getElementById 'dogs' .value == -1   {          index = document.getElementById 'dogs' .selectedIndex -1;          document.getElementById 'index' .value = index;          document.getElementById 'dog_name' .value = obj.dogs[index].dog_name;          document.getElementById 'dog_weight' .value = obj.dogs[index].dog_weight;  HTML list boxes include both text and values. The text is what the user sees; the value is what it   represents. This is very similar to PHP associative arrays—keys  indexes  and values. The if statement  checks the dogs array to determine its current value. If the value is -1, this indicates that the users did not  select anything, or they selected NEW. The JavaScript ! symbol works the same as the PHP ! symbol. The  symbol changes the if portion of the statement to execute when the value for 'dogs' is not -1. Thus, the  code will execute if the user has selected a dog from the dogs list box.  The selectedIndex property of a list box indicates the index selected by the user. However, the HTML   list box is numbered starting at 1. JavaScript arrays and JSON objects indexes start at 0. This causes the  selectedIndex to be one more than the position in a JavaScript array or JSON object. The code, in the  example, subtracts 1 to balance out the relationship. This value is placed in index. It is also saved in the   257   Chapter 8   MultifunCtional interfaCes  hidden property  on the HTML form  with the same name  index . Since index is a property and not a div  tag, the JavaScript value property must be used to set the value of index.  obj is the JSON object  with all the dogs  that was created when the AJAX call occurred. Information   can be retrieved from a JSON object in a very similar way as PHP associative arrays. The obj object is similar  to the multidimensional dogs array shown in previous chapters. The top array is the dogs “array”. In the  dogs array are the “arrays” for each individual dog. These do not have an associated key name, but have a  numerical index. Each dog array contains the individual elements  dog_name, dog_color, dog_breed, and  dog_weight . The index property, set in the previous code line, contains the dog index selected by the user.  It will be used to pull the selected dog information from obj to populate the form objects.  Since you know the exact location of the data to be retrieved  in index , loops are not needed. obj.dogs[index].dog_name uses the JSON object name  obj , the top array name  dogs , the number   of the dog array needed  index , and the name of the field required  dog_name  to access the required  information. Again, the format is similar to pulling information from a PHP associative array. The dog_name  and dog_weight values use this dot notation format to pull the information from the obj JSON object and  place it in the appropriate text box on the HTML form.  dog_color = obj.dogs[index].dog_color; if dog_color == "Brown"           {                  colorbuttons[0].checked = true;          } else if  dog_color == "Black"           {                  colorbuttons[1].checked = true;          } else if  dog_color == "Yellow"           {                  colorbuttons[2].checked = true;          } else if  dog_color == "White"           {                  colorbuttons[3].checked = true;          }  Setting the color requires a little more work. The dog_color is pulled from the obj object     dog_color = obj.dogs[index].dog_color;  and placed into a property  dog_color . An if statement  is then used to determine what color exists in this property.  Yes, JavaScript has a case statement that you  could have also used . The if statement sets the checked property of the correct radio button to true,  causing the radio button to be selected. Notice that the default value  'mixed'  is not included in the if  statement. If the dog is 'mixed', or somehow the color did not have a value in the object, there is no reason  to change from the default value  'mixed' .  dog_breed = obj.dogs[index].dog_breed; document.getElementById 'dog_breed' .value = dog_breed; document.getElementById 'update' .style.display = "inline"; document.getElementById 'delete' .style.display = "inline"; document.getElementById 'insert' .style.display = "none"; }  258   The breeds list box is set using the same code style as setting the text boxes. The value property sets the  list box text viewed by the users. The users can then change the value if desired. The "update" and "delete"  buttons are set to "inline" to be displayed. "Insert" is set to "none".  Chapter 8   MultifunCtional interfaCes  else {         colorbuttons[4].checked = true;         document.getElementById 'dog_name' .value = "";         document.getElementById 'dog_weight' .value = "";         document.getElementById 'dog_breed' .value = "Select a dog breed";         document.getElementById 'insert' .style.display = "inline";         document.getElementById 'update' .style.display = "none";         document.getElementById 'delete' .style.display = "none"; }  The else portion of the if statement executes if the index is -1  NEW is selected, or nothing was   selected . The defaults are set, as previously shown in other chapters, with the color set to 'mixed', the name  and weight text boxes being empty, and the breeds list box set to requesting the user to Select a dog breed.  The "insert" button is displayed  using "inline" . The other buttons are not displayed  using "none" .  document.getElementById 'input_form' .style.display = "inline"; }  Finally, the display of the form itself  now called input_form'  is set to 'inline', which will allow the   users to see the complete form and its values, as set in the previous code. Let’s take a look at the complete code.  Example 8-1.

Explain how PHP code can be used to replace the process that the JavaScript   code uses to display the list boxes, determine which dog was selected, and  populate the form objects with the information from the dog selected. This  process would be necessary for any browsers that do not have JavaScript  enabled. Hint: The PHP code will work in a very similar way to the JavaScript  code. What changes would be necessary to the dog_interface.php, dog.php,  and dog_data.php programs to accomplish this task?     2.  Download the code for this section from the book’s web site. Adjust the code to  handle dog information that will include the following additional fields: dog_ID   unique for each dog  and dog_gender. Assume that the dog_interface.php,   dog.php, and dog_data.php file will return these fields. You won’t be able to  completely test this assignment until you read about the changes to these programs.  Updating, Deleting, and Inserting in the Interface Tier  It’s time to look at the changes to the programs in the interface and business rules tiers. There are very few  required changes in the data tier, since previously the dog_data program was created to handle display,  update, insert, and deletion of dog information. Doing this ahead of time makes the total amount of changes  necessary to the other tiers much easier.  As mentioned throughout the book, the interface tier is responsible for formatting information for   display and for requesting or processing information from the business rules tier. The dog_interface  program should accept the dogs array information from the data tier and, if needed, format it for use in the  lab.php program. It should also accept the dogs information for the dogs list box, provide any format for it,  and send it to lab.php for display. In addition, dog_interface must accept requests from lab.php for insert,  update, and delete of dog information and pass these requests on to the data tier for processing. This may  sound like a lot, but as you will see, most of the coding already exists in these programs.  263   Chapter 8   MultifunCtional interfaCes  First let’s look at passing the request for insert or update to the data tier.  $dog_color = clean_input $_POST['dog_color'] ; $dog_weight = clean_input $_POST['dog_weight'] ; $dog_index = clean_input $_POST['index'] ;  The lab.php file will be sending a property  'index'  to dog_interface. This property will be accepted   and cleaned in the same manner as the other properties that are passed.  The type of information passed for a request to insert or update is almost exactly the same  all the dog   properties plus 'index' . Thus, the processes are very similar. You do need a way to indicate to the type of  request  update or insert .  if   isset $_POST['insert']     isset $_POST['update']    {         if  isset $_POST['insert']           {                 $insert = TRUE;         }         else         {                 $insert = FALSE;         }  You can do this by creating a property. In this example, $insert will be set to TRUE if it is an insert   request and FALSE if it is an update request. If the request is an update or insert, the properties array must  be populated.  $properties_array = array $dog_name,$dog_breed,$dog_color,$dog_weight,$breedxml,$insert,$dog_index ;  You can create the $properties_array as you have done in many examples before. Once created   it will be passed into an instance of the dog class. The only real changes are the addition of $insert and  $dog_index. The update procedure will use $dog_index to indicate which record to change. It will be set to  -1  by lab.php  when there is an insert because all records are inserted at the end of the data.  You could  have used -1 as an indicator of an insert, instead of creating $Insert.   $lab = $container->create_object $properties_array ;  Using $container  which is an instance of dog_container already created in the code , the    create_object method creates an instance of the dog class and passes the property array into it. You will  make a slight change to the dog class, in a moment, to use the property array to determine if the insert or  update methods from dog_data should be called to complete the request.  $_SESSION['message'] = "Dog $dog_name Insert Update was successful ";  264   Chapter 8   MultifunCtional interfaCes  If everything was successful with the update, instead of using echo or print to display a message, the   program will set $_SESSION['message'] with the message, which will then be displayed by lab.php.  header "Location: lab.php" ;  The application is then redirected back to lab.php. lab.php will verify that is was called from    dog_interface and then display "Dog $dog_name Insert Update was successful " at the top of the  page.  $dog_name is replaced with the actual dog name.   If the request is delete, a similar process occurs.  else if $_POST['delete']          {                 $properties_array = $dog_index;  The dog_data delete method only needs the position in the array to determine what to remove. Thus,  $properties_array is set to the value in $dog_index. Even though $properties_array is now a string and  not an array, the processRecords method in dog_data uses polymorphism to accept an array or a string.  This allows the code to be very similar to the update and insert code.  $lab = $container->create_object $properties_array ; $_SESSION['message'] = "Dog $dog_name Deletion was successful "; header "Location: lab.php" ;  As seen with update and delete, $container  which is an instance of dog_container already created   calls the create_object method to create an instance of the dog class and pass $properties_array  which  is really a string . If the delete is successful, $_SESSION['message'] is set with the delete message. Then the  lab.php program is called. lab.php will verify that dog_container called it and then display "Dog $dog_name  Deletion was successful " at the top of the page.  $dog_name is replaced with the actual dog name.  These are the only code changes needed in the dog_interface program in order to handle the request  to insert, update, or delete. dog_interface must also accept the dogs list box and complete dogs array from  the data tier to format and send to lab.php.  dog_interface must request the dogs array information by calling the display method in dog_data.php.  $container = NULL;  The container pointer, $container, can be reused after the request to return the breeds list has been  processed. By setting it to NULL, it will free up the current container  an instance of dog_container with  properties set for retrieving the breeds information .  $container = new dog_container "dog" ;  A new instance of the dog_container passes "dog" instead of "selectbox". This lets the container know   than an instance of the dog class will be created, not an instance of the breeds class.  $properties = "dog"; $lab = $container->create_object $properties ;  265   Chapter 8   MultifunCtional interfaCes  When an instance of the dog class is created by create_object, dog is again passed in to indicate that   an instance of the dog class is needed.  $container->set_app "dog" ; $dog_app = $container->get_dog_application "dog" ; $method_array = get_class_methods $lab ; $last_position = count $method_array  - 1; $method_name = $method_array[$last_position]; $returned_array = $lab->$method_name "ALL" ;  The same code that was used to call the delete, insert, and update methods in dog_data is used to  call the display method. However, ALL is passed in instead of the properties array. ALL tells the dog_data  display method to return all the dog records. All the records that are returned by dog_data are dropped into  $return_array.  Now that the dog_interface has all the records  in $return_array , it can format the code to display   the dogs list box. The code used is similar to the code to create the breeds list box.  $resultstring = " "; $resultstring = $resultstring . " NEW ";  The property $resultstring will hold all the code for the list box. First the HTML select tag is created   with an ID of 'dogs'. Then the first row of the list box is created for the user to select NEW if they want to  insert a new dog. Notice that the value for NEW is -1. That’s also the default value for the hidden property  'index' on the HTML form in lab.php. The code you looked at early in this chapter will determine that -1  is an indication to fill the HTML form objects with the default settings for the dog information. This is true  either if the user selects NEW or does not select anything in the dogs list box.  foreach  $returned_array as $column => $column_value      {         $resultstring = $resultstring . " " . $column_value['dog_name'];         $resultstring .= “&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" . $column_value['dog_breed'] . " ";     } $resultstring = $resultstring . " ";  A foreach loop will loop through the dogs array  contained in $returned_array  and build the   remaining rows of the list box using the dog_name and dog_breed from each of the dog entries in the array.  After all dogs have been placed in the list box, the list box is closed using the HTML   tag.  print $result . "" . $resultstring . "" . '{ "dogs" : ' . json_encode $returned_array  . "}";  lab.php expects to receive the breeds list box code in the first position, the dogs list box code in the   second position, and the complete dogs array in the third position. $result already contains the complete  breeds list box. $resultstring contains the new dogs list box. $return_array still contains all the dog  records. lab.php expects the outer array of the dogs array to be labeled as 'dogs'. The display method from  dog_data does not pass the outer array back. The previous code will create a dogs array that holds all the  individual dog arrays in it. Notice that the $return_array has been converted to JSON code when returned.  The JavaScript code in lab.php will verify that it is properly formatted JSON code when it is received.  Let’s look at the complete dog_interface program.  266   Chapter 8   MultifunCtional interfaCes  Example 8-3.

Note: If you  did not previously complete the earlier Do It, complete that assignment along  with this one.  Updating, Deleting, and Inserting in the Business Rules Tier  You are getting very close to completing the ABC Canine Shelter Reservation System. A few changes need  to be made to the Dog class to determine why the class was called  insert, delete, or update . Then the  information can be passed to the correct method in the dog_data class. As mentioned, no changes will be  needed to the dog_data class, as the methods for insert, update, and delete already exist. Also, the dog  class must retrieve all the dog records from dog_data to send to the dog_interface.  270   Chapter 8   MultifunCtional interfaCes  <?php class Dog {    ----------------------------------------- Properties ------------------------------------ private $dog_weight = 0; private $dog_breed = "no breed"; private $dog_color = "no color"; private $dog_name = "no name"; private $error_message = "??"; private $breedxml = ""; private $insert = FALSE; private $index = -1;  At the top of the Dog class properties, $insert and $index are created to hold the values passed from   the properties_array by the dog_interface program. $index is initially set to -1, indicating the default of  assuming that the user either selected NEW or did not select a dog from the dogs list box  in lab.php .  if  is_bool $properties_array[5]   &&  $properties_array[6] > -1   {    confirms true or false and valid index or takes default         $this->insert = $properties_array[5];         $this->index = $properties_array[6]; } $this->change_dog_data "Insert Update" ; } if is_numeric $properties_array   {      confirms valid index don't delete if not valid         $this->index = $properties_array;         $this->change_dog_data "Delete" ; }  In the constructor, after the dog values  dog_name, dog_breed, dog_weight, and dog_color  have been   validated, the insert and index values also need to be validated. The if statement shown uses the PHP method  is_bool to determine if the value in $properties_array[5] is TRUE or FALSE. $properties_array[5] is  the location of the value from the insert property.  It’s set to TRUE if it is an insert and set to FALSE if it is an  Update . The if statement also determines if the value in $properties_array[6] is greater than -1. A value   greater than -1 indicates an update or deletion. A value of -1 indicates an insertion request. If valid, the  values are placed into $this->insert and $this->index. Then the private method called change_dog_data  is called passing in “insert update”.  The next if statement uses the PHP method is_numeric to determine if $properties_array is    not actually an array and that it contains a number. If this is true, the index of the dog to be removed has  been passed. If this is the case, then $property_array  containing the index to be deleted  is placed in  $this->index and the private method called change_dog_data is called passing in “delete”.  private function change_dog_data $type  { if   file_exists "e8dog_container.php"   {         require_once "e8dog_container.php" ;    use chapter 5 container w exception handling } else         {         throw new Exception "Dog container file missing or corrupt" ; }            271   Chapter 8   MultifunCtional interfaCes          $container = new dog_container "dogdata" ;    sets the tag name to look for in XML file         $properties_array = array "dogdata" ;    not used but must be passed into create_object         $dog_data = $container->create_object $properties_array ;    creates dog_data object  The new change_dog_data method  called in the previous code  will use code very similar to the   display_dog_data method shown in a previous chapter. First the method verifies that the dog_container  exists. If the container exists, an instance of the container  $container  is created passing "dogdata" which  tells the container that this request will be using the dogs XML file. Next $properties_array is created  with a simple array containing "dogdata". This array will not actually be used. However, the dog_data class  requires that something be passed into the constructor. An instance of dog_data  $dog_data  is now created  using the create_object method of the container.  $method_array = get_class_methods $dog_data ; $last_position = count $method_array  - 1; $method_name = $method_array[$last_position];  As seen in previous code, the change_dog_data method uses the PHP get_class_methods to create  an array of methods contained in the dog_data object  $dog_data . The last method in dog_data is the  processRecords method, which uses a case statement to call the correct private method.  if   $this->index > -1  &&  $type == "Delete"           {         $record_Array = $this->index;         $dog_data->$method_name "Delete",$record_Array ;         }  If the index is greater than -1 and the type is "delete" then the change_dog_data method calls the   processRecords method of the dog_data object and passes "delete" and the index to be deleted.  else if   $this->index == -1  &&  $type == "Insert Update"           {          $record_Array = array array 'dog_name'=>"$this->dog_name", 'dog_weight'=>"$this->   dog_weight", 'dog_color'=>"$this->dog_color", 'dog_breed'=>"$this->dog_breed"  ;          $dog_data->$method_name "Insert",$record_Array ;         }  If the index is -1 and the type is "insert update" then the user has requested an “insert”. An array  is created containing all the dog properties  dog_name, dog_weight, dog_color, and dog_breed . Then  “insert” and the array are passed into the processRecords method of the dog_object.  else if  $type == "Insert Update"          {          $record_Array = array $this->index => array 'dog_name'=>"$this->dog_name",    'dog_weight'=>"$this->dog_weight", 'dog_color'=>"$this->dog_color",   'dog_breed'=>"$this->dog_breed"  ;          $dog_data->$method_name "Update",$record_Array ;         }         $dog_data = NULL; }  272   Chapter 8   MultifunCtional interfaCes  If the index is not -1 and the type is "insert update", then the user has requested an update of   information. The same array as shown with an insert is created, with one exception. The index of the array   array $this->index =>   is set to the index of the record to be updated. The array and “update” are then  passed to the processRecords method of the dog_data object.  After the record has been inserted, updated, or deleted, the dog_data object  $dog_data  is set to NULL.   As stated in previous chapters, the dog_data object first updates the associate array, which contains each  dog’s information. When the destructor of the dog_data object is called, the information is then updated to  the dog_data XML file. Setting $dog_data to NULL releases the dog_data object, which calls its destructor.  That completes all the changes to the business rules tier. Let’s put it all together.  Example 8-4.

Download the code for this section from the book’s web site. Run the  almost    completed program. Try to “break” the program. Did you accomplish the task? If  so, what broke? Attempt to fix any problems you might discover.  2.  Download the code for this section from the book’s web site. Adjust the code to  handle dog information that will include the following additional fields: dog_ID   unique for each dog  and dog_gender. Adjust the dog.php and dog_data.php  programs to return these fields. You should now be able to test the complete  application. Note: If you did not previously complete the Do Its earlier in this  chapter, complete these assignments along with this one.  Final Touches  You will finish the coding of the ABC Canine Shelter Reservation System in this section  finally! . You will use  some CSS code from Chapter 2 to help make the application look more professional. In addition, you will  add a menu that will allow the users to read the errors logs and sign out of the application  close the session .  The CSS code from Chapter 2 uses the HTML tag     to control the contents of    the body section. This tag is therefore added directly after the body tag  and closed right before the closing  body tag .          ABC Canine Shelter Reservation System   Do It       276   Chapter 8   MultifunCtional interfaCes  The CSS code also uses the HTML tag     to format the header  title  of the page. The   code has also been adjusted to include an image of a dog using the HTML img tag.   Manage Error Logs    Change  Password    Log Off     A simple menu is also included in the header section, which will allow the users to read the error log,  change their passwords, or log off the application. Notice that the code to log off the system will recall the  lab.php program and create a property "logoff" with a value of "True". You will make just a sight final  adjustment to the lab.php code to handle this selection.  All the remaining contents of the body section are placed in the HTML tag    .     ABC Canine Shelter Reservation System     The CSS code from Chapter 2 will be pulled into the file in the head section. The file has been renamed.  The contents of the file remain unchanged except for adding a float: top to the wrapper to align the display  with the top of the browser and text-align: center to the header to center the title of the application.  These changes provide a better look and feel for the application. The last code you need to look at in the lab.php program is the logoff routine.  session_start  ; if  isset $_GET['logoff']   { session_destroy  ; } if   !isset $_SESSION['username']     !isset $_SESSION['password']     isset $_GET['logoff']    {  At the top of the code for lab.php an if statement is added to determine if logoff has been set  via GET .   If it has, the session is destroyed. The if statement to determine if the user ID and password has not been  set, and is also modified to include checking if logoff has been set. If it has been set, then  at this point  the  user is no longer logged in to the system.  echo "   ABC Canine Shelter Reservation System "; echo "  img {  height: 100px; width: 140px; }   "; echo "    ABC Canine Shelter  Reservation System  "; echo " "; echo "You must login to access the ABC Canine Shelter Reservation System"; echo " "; echo " Login    Create an account "; echo " "; echo "  Copyright &copy; 2015 Little Ocean Waves Publishing - Steve  Prettyman  "; echo "  ";  277   Chapter 8   MultifunCtional interfaCes  The user is then redirected to either log in or create an account. Also notice that the code has been   modified to include the same div tags for wrapper, header, content, and footer. This will give the page the  same look as the lab.php file.  In addition, any page displayed to the users should have this look. The displayRecords method of the   readerrorlog program has also been modified  as shown here  to include the same div tags.  echo "   ABC Canine Shelter Reservation System "; echo " "; echo "  table { border: 2px solid 5c744d;}"; echo "img { height: 100px; width: 140px; }  "; echo "  "; echo "     ABC Canine Shelter  Reservation System   "; echo " "; echo " Log File: " .

Additional tiers could also be used to break a large  application across multiple servers.  Figure 8-6.  The complete ABC Canine Shelter Reservation System  In addition to the tiers, maintenance programs  readerrorlog and readchangelog  provide the ability   to tighten security, fix errors, and provide backup and recovery.  Limitations The ABC Canine Shelter Reservation System has been used as a teaching tool in this book. However,  the system is not complete and ready for the real world. Many of the limitations of the system have been  addressed in this book and used as exercises for you to gain further PHP programming skills. The changes  shown next should be made to the system to improve the user experience, security, and performance. In  addition, user testing is critical to ensure that the users of the system are satisfied. Users who are not happy  with the design and performance of the system are not likely to use it.  285   Chapter 8   MultifunCtional interfaCes  lab.php   	   	   	  	  	   	   	  	   	   	   	   	   	   	   	  	  	   	  A Dog_ID or some other type of unique field needs to be included to determine the  difference between dogs with the same name and breed.  The form for users not using JavaScript needs to use PHP to call and retrieve needed  information for update and delete ability.  A link to displaychangelog.php needs to be provided in the menu selection.  A Dog_Gender field needs to exist. It would also be good if dog pictures existed.  The program needs to handle and respond to users attempt to insert a dog that  already exists.  dog_interface.php  Dog_ID information  update insert  needs to be accepted from the Dog class and  passed to lab.php.   	 Code is needed to return requests to lab.php for the complete dogs array and a  specific dog for the non_JavaScript-enabled browsers. The information will be  retrieved from dog.php.  The Dog_Gender field needs to be pulled from dog.php and passed to lab.php.  A session message must be passed to the lab.php program when the user attempts  to enter a dog that is already in the data. The message is created in a catch block.  dog.php  dog_data.php  register.php  The Dog_ID information needs to be pulled from dog_data.php and passed to   dog_interface.php.

The Dog_Gender needs to be passed to dog.php. The ability to insert and updated this  field needs to be included.  This program needs to include a unique field  customerID  to determine duplicate  user IDs. This field will be generated and not entered by the users.  This program needs to detect users attempting to create a duplicate ID. Code could  even make suggestions for user ID names based on what the user attempted to  create  such as adding numbers to the end of the user ID .  This program needs to require the user to also use a special symbol for the password.  This program needs security questions in case the user forgets his password.  Additional fields are needed, such as name, e-mail, and address.  This program needs to be able to create a temporary password for users who forget  their passwords but remember answers to their security questions.  login.php  286   Chapter 8   MultifunCtional interfaCes  Overall   	   	  You need to consider moving more program  file  names to XML files for easier  version changes.

This new book on PHP 7 introduces writing solid, secure, object-oriented code in the new PHP 7, carefully presented in a well-paced, clear fashion. In Learn PHP 7, programming examples take advantage of the newest PHP features, including enhanced password encryption using password_hash. This book takes a learn-by-doing approach, providing you with complete coding examples. "Do It" exercises in each chapter provide the opportunity to make adjustments to the example code. The end of chapter programming exercises allow you to develop your own applications using the algorithms demonstrated in the chapter. You will experience the creation of a complete three-tier application using a natural process of building and testing modules within each tier. Each tier is logically and physically separated using object-oriented and dependency injection techniques, thus allowing independent tiers that can be updated with little or no effect on the other tiers. In addition to teaching good programming practices through OOP, there is a strong emphasis on creating secure code. As each chapter is completed, the reader is provide the opportunity to design and create an application reinforcing the concepts learned.
