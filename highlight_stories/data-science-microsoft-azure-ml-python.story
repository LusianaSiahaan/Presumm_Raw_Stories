The Azure ML platform has greatly simplified  the  development  and  deployment  of  machine  learning models,  with  easy-to-use  and  powerful  cloud-based  data  transfor‐ mation and machine learning tools. We’ll  explore  extending  Azure  ML  with  the  Python  language.  A companion  report  explores  extending  Azure  ML  using  the  R  lan‐ guage. All of the concepts we will cover are illustrated with a data science example,  using  a  bicycle  rental  demand  dataset.  We’ll  perform  the required  data  manipulation,  or  data  munging.  Then  we  will  con‐ struct and evaluate regression models for the dataset. You can follow along by downloading the code and data provided in the  next  section.  Later  in  the  report,  we’ll  discuss  publishing  your trained models as web services in the Azure cloud. Before  we  get  started,  let’s  review  a  few  of  the  benefits  Azure  ML provides for machine learning solutions:    Solutions can be quickly and easily deployed as web services.   Models run in a highly scalable, secure cloud environment.  1     Azure  ML  is  integrated  with  the  Microsoft  Cortana  Analytics Suite, which includes massive storage and processing capabili‐ ties. It can read data from, and write data to, Cortana storage at significant volume. Azure ML can be employed as the analytics engine for other components of the Cortana Analytics Suite.    Machine  learning  algorithms  and  data  transformations  are extendable  using  the  Python  or  R  languages  for  solution- specific functionality.    Rapidly  operationalized  analytics  are  written  in  the  R  and  Python languages.    Code and data are maintained in a secure cloud environment.  Downloads For our example, we will be using the Bike Rental UCI dataset avail‐ able in Azure ML. This data is preloaded into Azure ML; you can also  download  this  data  as  a  .csv  file  from  the  UCI  website. The  reference  for  this  data  is  Fanaee-T,  Hadi,  and  Gama,  Joao, “Event labeling combining ensemble detectors and background knowl‐ edge,” Progress in Artificial Intelligence  2013 : pp. 1-15, Springer Ber‐ lin Heidelberg. The Python code for our example can be found on GitHub. Working Between Azure ML and Spyder Azure  ML  uses  the  Anaconda  Python  2.7  distribution.  You  should perform your development and testing of Python code in the same environment to simplify the process. Azure ML is a production environment. It is ideally suited to pub‐ lishing  machine  learning  models.  However,  it’s  not  a  particularly good code development environment. In  general,  you  will  find  it  easier  to  perform  preliminary  editing, testing,  and  debugging  in  an  integrated  development  environment  IDE . The Anaconda Python distribution includes the Spyder IDE. In this way, you take advantage of the powerful development resour‐ ces and perform your final testing in Azure ML. Downloads for the Anaconda Python 2.7 distribution are available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Do not use the Python 3.X versions, as the code created is not compatible with Azure ML.  2     Data Science in the Cloud with Microsoft Azure Machine Learning and Python   If you prefer using Jupyter notebooks, you can certainly do your code development  in  this  environment.  We  will  discuss  this  later  in “Using Jupyter Notebooks with Azure ML” on page 53. This report assumes the reader is familiar with the basics of Python. If you are not familiar with Python in Azure ML, the following short tutorial  will  be  useful:  Execute  Python  machine  learning  scripts  in Azure Machine Learning Studio. The Python source code for the data science example in this report can be run in either Azure ML, in Spyder, or in IPython. Read the comments  in  the  source  files  to  see  the  changes  required  to  work between these two environments. Overview of Azure ML This section provides a short overview of Azure Machine Learning. You  can  find  more  detail  and  specifics,  including  tutorials,  at  the Microsoft  Azure  web  page.  Additional  learning  resources  can  be found on the Azure Machine Learning documentation site. For  deeper  and  broader  introductions,  I  have  created  two  video courses:    Data Science with Microsoft Azure and R: Working with Cloud- based Predictive Analytics and Modeling  O’Reilly  provides an in-depth  exploration  of  doing  data  science  with  Azure  ML and R.    Data Science and Machine Learning Essentials, an edX course by myself and Cynthia Rudin, provides a broad introduction to data science using Azure ML, R, and Python.  As  we  work  through  our  data  science  example  in  subsequent  sec‐ tions, we include specific examples of the concepts presented here. We encourage you to go to the Microsoft Azure Machine Learning site to create your own free-tier account and try these examples on your own. Azure ML Studio Azure ML models are built and tested in the web-based Azure ML Studio. Figure 1 shows an example of the Azure ML Studio.  Overview of Azure ML      3   Figure 1. Azure ML Studio  A workflow of the model appears in the center of the studio window. A dataset and an Execute Python Script module are on the canvas. On the left side of the Studio display, you see datasets and a series of tabs  containing  various  types  of  modules.  Properties  of  whichever dataset or module has been selected can be seen in the right panel. In  this  case,  you  see  the  Python  code  contained  in  the  Execute Python Script module.  Build your own experiment Building your own experiment in Azure ML is quite simple. Click the + symbol in the lower lefthand corner of the studio window. You will see a display resembling Figure 2. Select either a blank experi‐ ment or one of the sample experiments. If  you  choose  a  blank  experiment,  start  dragging  and  dropping modules  and  datasets  onto  your  canvas.  Connect  the  module  out‐ puts to inputs to build an experiment.  4     Data Science in the Cloud with Microsoft Azure Machine Learning and Python   Figure 2. Creating a New Azure ML Experiment Getting Data In and Out of Azure ML Azure ML supports several data I O options, including:    Web services   HTTP connections   Azure SQL tables   Azure Blob storage   Azure Tables; noSQL key-value tables   Hive queries  These  data  I O  capabilities  enable  interaction  with  either  external applications and other components of the Cortana Analytics Suite.  We will investigate web service publishing in “Publish‐ ing a Model as a Web Service” on page 48.  Data I O at scale is supported by the Azure ML Reader and Writer modules.  The  Reader  and  Writer  modules  provide  interface  with Cortana  data  storage  components.  Figure  3  shows  an  example  of configuring  the  Reader  module  to  read  data  from  a  hypothetical  Overview of Azure ML      5   Azure  SQL  table.  Similar  capabilities  are  available  in  the  Writer module for outputting data at volume.  Figure 3. Configuring the Reader Module for an Azure SQL Query Modules and Datasets Mixing native modules and Python in Azure ML Azure ML provides a wide range of modules for data transforma‐ tion, machine learning, and model evaluation. Most native  built-in  Azure ML modules are computationally-efficient and scalable. As a general rule, these native modules should be your first choice. The deep and powerful Python language extends Azure ML to meet the  requirements  of  specific  data  science  problems.  For  example, solution-specific data transformation and cleaning can be coded in Python. Python language scripts contained in Execute Python Script modules  can  be  run  inline  with  native  Azure  ML  modules.  Addi‐ tionally, the Python language gives Azure ML powerful data visuali‐ zation  capabilities.  You  can  also  use  the  many  available  analytics algorithms packages such as scikit-learn and StatsModels. As we work through the examples, you will see how to mix native Azure ML modules and Execute Python Script modules to create a complete solution.  6     Data Science in the Cloud with Microsoft Azure Machine Learning and Python   Execute Python Script Module I O In the Azure ML Studio, input ports are located at the top of module icons, and output ports are located below module icons.  If you move your mouse over the ports of a module, you will see a “tool tip” that shows the type of data for that port.  The Execute Python Script module has five ports:    The  Dataset1  and  Dataset2  ports  are  inputs  for  rectangular Azure  data  tables,  and  they  produce  a  Pandas  data  frame  in Python.    The  Script  bundle  port  accepts  a  zipped  Python  modules   .py  files  or dataset files.    The Result dataset output port produces an Azure rectangular  data table from a Pandas data frame.    The  Python  device  port  produces  output  of  text  or  graphics  from R.  Within  experiments,  workflows  are  created  by  connecting  the appropriate  ports  between  modules—output  port  to  input  port. Connections are made by dragging your mouse from the output port of one module to the input port of another module. Some tips for using Python in Azure ML can be found in the docu‐ mentation. Azure ML Workflows Model training workflow Figure  4  shows  a  generalized  workflow  for  training,  scoring,  and evaluating  a  machine  learning  model  in  Azure  ML.  This  general workflow  is  the  same  for  most  regression  and  classification  algo‐ rithms. The model definition can be a native Azure ML module or, in some cases, Python code.  Overview of Azure ML      7   Figure 4. A generalized model training workflow for Azure ML models  Key points on the model training workflow:    Data input can come from a variety of interfaces, including web services,  HTTP  connections,  Azure  SQL,  and  Hive  Query. These data sources can be within the Cortana suite or external to it. In most cases, for training and testing models, you will use a saved dataset.    Transformations of the data can be performed using a combina‐  tion of native Azure ML modules and the Python language.    A Model Definition module defines the model type and proper‐ ties. On the lefthand pane of the Studio, you will see numerous choices for models. The parameters of the model are set in the properties pane.    The Training module trains the model. Training of the model is scored in the Score module, and performance summary statis‐ tics are computed in the Evaluate module.  The following sections include specific examples of each of the steps illustrated in Figure 4.  Publishing a model as a web service Once  you  have  developed  and  evaluated  a  satisfactory  model,  you can publish it as a web service. You will need to create streamlined workflow for promotion to production. A schematic view is shown in Figure 5.  8     Data Science in the Cloud with Microsoft Azure Machine Learning and Python   Figure 5. Workflow for an Azure ML model published as a web service  Some key points of the workflow for publishing a web service are:    Typically,  you  will  use  transformations  you  created  and  saved when you were training the model. These include saved trans‐ formations  from  the  various  Azure  ML  data  transformation modules and modified Python transformation code.    The product of the training processes  discussed previously  is  the trained model.    You  can  apply  transformations  to  results  produced  by  the model. Examples of transformations include deleting unneeded columns and converting units of numerical results.  A Regression Example Problem and Data Overview Demand  and  inventory  forecasting  are  fundamental  business  pro‐ cesses. Forecasting is used for supply chain management, staff level management, production management, power production manage‐ ment, and many other applications. In this example, we will construct and test models to forecast hourly demand for a bicycle rental system. The ability to forecast demand is important  for  the  effective  operation  of  this  system.  If  insufficient bikes are available, regular users will be inconvenienced. The users become  reluctant  to  use  the  system,  lacking  confidence  that  bikes  A Regression Example      9   will be available when needed. If too many bikes are available, oper‐ ating costs increase unnecessarily. In data science problems, it is always important to gain an under‐ standing of the objectives of the end-users. In this case, having a rea‐ sonable number of extra bikes on-hand is far less of an issue than having  an  insufficient  inventory.  Keep  this  fact  in  mind  as  we  are evaluating models. For  this  example,  we’ll  use  a  dataset  containing  a  time  series  of demand information for the bicycle rental system. These data con‐ tain hourly demand figures over a two-year period, for both regis‐ tered and casual users. There are nine features, also know as predic‐ tor, or independent, variables. The dataset contains a total of 17,379 rows or cases. The first and possibly most important task in creating effective pre‐ dictive analytics models is determining the feature set. Feature selec‐ tion is usually more important than the specific choice of machine learning model. Feature candidates include variables in the dataset, transformed  or  filtered  values  of  these  variables,  or  new  variables computed from the variables in the dataset. The process of creating the feature set is sometimes known as feature selection and feature engineering. In  addition  to  feature  engineering,  data  cleaning  and  editing  are critical in most situations. Filters can be applied to both the predic‐ tor and response variables. The dataset is available in the Azure ML sample datasets. You can also download it as a .csv file either from Azure ML or from the Uni‐ versity of California Machine Learning Repository. A First Set of Transformations For  our  first  step,  we’ll  perform  some  transformations  on  the  raw input data using the code from the transform.py file, shown next, in an Azure ML Execute Python Script module:   The main function with a single argument, a Pandas dataframe   from  the  first  input  port  of  the  Execute  Python  Script  mod ule. def azureml_main BikeShare :     import pandas as pd     from sklearn import preprocessing     import utilities as ut  10     Data Science in the Cloud with Microsoft Azure Machine Learning and Python       import numpy as np     import os   If not in the Azure environment, read the data from a csv  file for testing purposes.

The  arguments  to  this  function  are  one  or  two Python  Pandas  dataframes  input  from  the  Dataset1  and  Dataset2 input ports. In this case, the single argument is named frame1. Notice  the  conditional  statement  near  the  beginning  of  this  code listing.  When  the  logical  variable  Azure  is  set  to  False,  the  data frame is read from the .csv file. The rest of this code performs some filtering and feature engineer‐ ing. The filtering includes removing unnecessary columns and scal‐ ing the numeric features. The term feature engineering refers to transformations applied to the dataset to create new predictive features. In this case, we create four new  columns,  or  features.  As  we  explore  the  data  and  construct the  model,  we  will  determine  if  any  of  these  features  actually improves our model performance. These new columns include the following information:    Indicate if it is a workday or not   Count of the number of months from the beginning of the time  series  shifting by 5 hours    Transformed time of day for working and nonworking days by    A count of days from the start of the time series  The utilities.py file contains a utility function used in the transfor‐ mations.

The module is packaged into a .zip file, and uploaded into Azure ML Studio. The Python code in the zip file is then available, in any Execute Python Script module in the experi‐ ment connected to the zip.  Exploring the data Let’s  have  a  first  look  at  the  data  by  walking  through  a  series  of exploratory plots. An additional Execute Python Script module with the visualization code is added to the experiment. At this point, our Azure ML experiment looks like Figure 6. The first Execute Python Script module, titled “Transform Data,” contains the code shown in the previous code listing.  Figure 6. The Azure ML experiment in Studio  The  Execute  Python  Script  module,  shown  at  the  bottom  of  this experiment, runs code for exploring the data, using output from the Execute  Python  Script  module  that  transforms  the  data.  The  new Execute Python Script module contains the visualization code con‐ tained in the visualize.py file. In this section, we will explore the dataset step by step, discussing each section of code and the resulting charts. Normally, the entire set of code would be run at one time, including a return statement at the end. You can add to this code a step at a time as long as you have a return statement at the end.  A Regression Example      13   The first section of the code is shown here. This code creates two plots of the correlation matrix between each of the features and the features and the label  count of bikes rented .  def azureml_main BikeShare :     import matplotlib     matplotlib.use 'agg'    Set backend     matplotlib.rcParams.update {'font.size': 20}       from sklearn import preprocessing     from sklearn import linear_model     import numpy as np     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt     import statsmodels.graphics.correlation as pltcor     import statsmodels.nonparametric.smoothers_lowess as lw      Azure = False       Sort the data frame based on the dayCount     BikeShare.sort 'dayCount',  axis = 0, inplace = True        De-trend the bike demand with time.     nrow = BikeShare.shape[0]     X = BikeShare.dayCount.as_matrix  .reshape  nrow,1       Y = BikeShare.cnt.as_matrix        Compute the linear model.     clf = linear_model.LinearRegression       bike_lm = clf.fit X, Y       Remove the trend     BikeShare.cnt = BikeShare.cnt - bike_lm.predict X        Compute the correlation matrix and set the diagonal      elements to 0.     arry = BikeShare.drop 'dteday', axis = 1 .as_matrix       arry = preprocessing.scale arry, axis = 1      corrs = np.corrcoef arry, rowvar = 0      np.fill_diagonal corrs, 0       col_nms = list BikeShare [1:]     fig = plt.figure figsize =  9,9       ax = fig.gca       pltcor.plot_corr corrs, xnames = col_nms, ax = ax      plt.show       if Azure == True : fig.savefig 'cor1.png'        Compute and plot the correlation matrix with      a smaller subset of columns.         cols  =  ['yr',  'mnth',  'isWorking',  'xformWorkHr',  'day Count',             'temp', 'hum', 'windspeed', 'cnt']     arry = BikeShare[cols].as_matrix    14     Data Science in the Cloud with Microsoft Azure Machine Learning and Python       arry = preprocessing.scale arry, axis = 1      corrs = np.corrcoef arry, rowvar = 0      np.fill_diagonal corrs, 0       fig = plt.figure figsize =  9,9       ax = fig.gca       pltcor.plot_corr corrs, xnames = cols, ax = ax      plt.show       if Azure == True : fig.savefig 'cor2.png'   This code creates a number of charts that we will subsequently dis‐ cuss. The code takes the following steps:    The first two lines import matplotlib and configure a backend for Azure ML to use. This configuration must be done before any other graphics libraries are imported or used.    The  dataframe  is  sorted  into  time  order.  Sorting  ensures  that  time series plots appear in the correct order.    Bike demand  cnt  is de-trended using a linear model from the scikit-learn  package.  De-trending  removes  a  source  of  bias  in the  correlation  estimates.  We  are  particularly  interested  in  the correlation  of  the  features   predictor  variables   with  this  de- trended label  response .  The  selected  columns  of  the  Pandas  dataframe have  been  coerced  to  NumPy  arrays,  with  the as_matrix method.    The correlation matrix is computed using the NumPy package.  The values along the diagonal are set to zero.  The  data  in  the  Pandas  dataframe  have  been coerced  to  a  NumPy  array  with  the  as_matrix method.    The  correlation  matrix  is  plotted  using  statsmodels.graph  ics.correlation.plot_corr.    If Azure = True, the plot object is saved to a file with a unique name. The contents of this file will be displayed at the Python device port of the Execute Python Script module. If the plot is not saved to a file with a unique name, it will not be displayed. The resulting plot is shown in Figure 7.  A Regression Example      15     The  last  code  computes  and  plots  a  correlation  matrix  for  a  reduced set of features, shown in Figure 8.  To  run  this  code  in  Azure  ML,  make  sure  you  set Azure = True.  Figure 7. Plot of correlation matrix  The first correlation matrix is shown in Figure 7. This plot is domi‐ nated by the strong correlations between many of the features. For example, date-time features are correlated, as are weather features. There  is  also  some  significant  correlation  between  date-time  and weather  features.  This  correlation  results  from  seasonal  variation  annual, daily, etc.  in weather conditions. There is also strong posi‐ tive correlation between the feature  cnt  and several other features. It is clear that many of these features are redundant with each other, and some significant pruning of this dataset is in order. To get a better look at the correlations, Figure 8 shows a plot using a reduced feature set.  16     Data Science in the Cloud with Microsoft Azure Machine Learning and Python   Figure 8. Plot of correlation matrix without dayWeek variable  The patterns revealed in this plot are much the same as those seen in Figure  6.  The  patterns  in  correlation  support  the  hypothesis  that many of the features are redundant.  You  should  always  keep  in  mind  the  pitfalls  in  the interpretation  of  correlation.  First,  and  most  impor‐ tantly, correlation should never be confused with cau‐ sation.  A  highly  correlated  variable  may  or  may  not imply causation. Second, any particular feature highly correlated, or uncorrelated, with the label may, or may not,  be  a  good  predictor.  The  variable  may  be  nearly collinear with some other predictor, or the relationship with the response may be nonlinear.  Next,  time  series  plots  for  selected  hours  of  the  day  are  created, using the following code:   Make time series plots of bike demand by times of the day.     times = [7, 9, 12, 15, 18, 20, 22]     for tm in times:         fig = plt.figure figsize= 8, 6    A Regression Example      17           fig.clf           ax = fig.gca           BikeShare[BikeShare.hr == tm].plot kind = 'line',                                            x = 'dayCount', y =  'cnt',                                            ax = ax          plt.xlabel "Days from start of plot"          plt.ylabel "Count of bikes rented"          plt.title "Bikes rented by days for hour = " + str tm           plt.show                   if Azure  ==  True :  fig.savefig 'tsplot'  +  str tm   +  '.png'   This code loops over a list of hours of the day. For each hour, a time series plot object is created and saved to a file with a unique name. The  contents  of  these  files  will  be  displayed  at  the  Python  device port of the Execute Python Script module. Two examples of the time series plots for two specific hours of the day are shown in Figures 9 and 10. Recall that these time series have had the linear trend removed.  Figure 9. Time series plot of bike demand for the 0700 hour  18     Data Science in the Cloud with Microsoft Azure Machine Learning and Python   Figure 10. Time series plot of bike demand for the 1800 hour  Notice the differences in the shape of these curves at the two differ‐ ent hours. Also, note the outliers at the low side of demand. These outliers  can  be  a  source  of  bias  when  training  machine  learning models. Next,  we  will  create  some  box  plots  to  explore  the  relationship between the categorical features and the label  cnt . The following code shows the box plots.   Boxplots for the predictor values vs the demand for bikes.     BikeShare = set_day BikeShare      labels = ["Box plots of hourly bike demand",             "Box plots of monthly bike demand",             "Box plots of bike demand by weather factor",             "Box plots of bike demand by workday vs. holiday",             "Box plots of bike demand by day of the week",             "Box plots by transformed work hour of the day"]     xAxes = ["hr", "mnth", "weathersit",               "isWorking", "dayWeek", "xformWorkHr"]     for lab, xaxs in zip labels, xAxes :         fig = plt.figure figsize= 10, 6           fig.clf           ax = fig.gca           BikeShare.boxplot column = ['cnt'], by = [xaxs], ax =  ax          plt.xlabel ''          plt.ylabel 'Number of bikes'          plt.show    A Regression Example      19                   if Azure  ==  True :  fig.savefig 'boxplot'  +  xaxs  +  '.png'   This code executes the following steps:  1. The set_day function is called  see the following code . 2. A list of figure captions is created. 3. A list of column names for the features is defined. 4. A for loop iterates over the list of captions and columns, creat‐  ing a box plot of each specified feature.  5. For each hour, a time series object plot is created and saved to a file with a unique name. The contents of these files will be dis‐ played at the Python device port of the Execute Python Script module.  This code requires one function, defined in the visualise.py file.  def set_day df :     '''     This function assigns day names to each of the     rows in the dataset. The function needs to account     for the fact that some days are missing and there     may be some missing hours as well.     '''      Assumes the first day of the dataset is Saturday     days = ["Sat", "Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed",             "Thr", "Fri"]     temp = ['d']*df.shape[0]     i = 0     indx = 0     cur_day = df.dteday[0]     for day in df.dteday:         if cur_day != day :             cur_day = day             if i == 6 : i = 0             else: i += 1         temp[indx] = days[i]         indx += 1     df['dayWeek'] = temp     return df  This  function  creates  a  new  feature  showing  the  day  of  the  week, using day names that make the plots easier to understand. Three of the resulting box plots are shown in Figures 11, 12, and 13.  20     Data Science in the Cloud with Microsoft Azure Machine Learning and Python   Figure 11. Box plots showing the relationship between bike demand and hour of the day  Figure 12. Box plots showing the relationship between bike demand and weather situation  From  these  plots,  you  can  see  differences  in  the  likely  predictive power of these three features. Significant  and  complex  variation  in  hourly  bike  demand  can  be seen  in  Figure  11   this  behavior  may  prove  difficult  to  model .  In contrast,  it  looks  doubtful  that  weather  situation   weathersit   is going to be very helpful in predicting bike demand, despite the rela‐ tively high correlation value observed.  A Regression Example      21   Figure 13. Box plots showing the relationship between bike demand and day of the week  The  result  shown  in  Figure  13  is  surprising—we  expected  bike demand to depend on the day of the week. Once again, the outliers at the low end of bike demand can be seen in the box plots. Finally,  we’ll  create  some  scatter  plots  to  explore  the  continuous variables, using the following code:   Make scatter plot of bike demand vs. various features.     labels = ["Bike demand vs temperature",             "Bike demand vs humidity",             "Bike demand vs windspeed",             "Bike demand vs hr",             "Bike demand vs xformHr",             "Bike demand vs xformWorkHr"]     xAxes = ["temp", "hum", "windspeed", "hr",            "xformHr", "xformWorkHr"]     for lab, xaxs in zip labels, xAxes :          first compute a lowess fit to the data                 los  =  lw.lowess BikeShare['cnt'],  BikeShare[xaxs],  frac = 0.2            Now make the plots         fig = plt.figure figsize= 8, 6           fig.clf           ax = fig.gca           BikeShare.plot kind = 'scatter', x = xaxs, y = 'cnt',  ax = ax, alpha = 0.05                  plt.plot los[:,  0],  los[:,  1],  axes  =  ax,  color  =   22     Data Science in the Cloud with Microsoft Azure Machine Learning and Python   'red'          plt.show           if Azure == True : fig.savefig 'scatterplot' + xaxs +  '.png'   This code is quite similar to the code used for the box plots. We have included a lowess smoothed line on each of these plots using stats‐ models.nonparametric.smoothers_lowess.lowess. Also, note that we increased the point transparency  small value of alpha , so we get a feel for the number of overlapping data points.  When  plotting  a  large  number  of  points,  “over- plotting” is a significant problem. Overplotting makes it difficult to tell the actual point density as points lie on top of each other. Methods like color scales, point transparency, and hexbinning can all be applied to sit‐ uations with significant overplotting.  lowess  method   is  quite  memory   The  intensive. Depending on how much memory you have on your local machine, you may or may not be able to run this code. Fortunately, Azure ML runs on servers with 60 GB of RAM, which is more than up to the job.  The resulting scatter plots are shown in Figures 14 and 15.  Figure 14. Scatter plot of bike demand versus humidity  A Regression Example      23   Figure 14 shows a clear trend of generally-decreasing bike demand with increased humidity. However, at the low end of humidity, the data is sparse and the trend is less certain. We will need to proceed with care.  Figure 15. Scatter plot of bike demand versus temperature  Figure 15 shows the scatter plot of bike demand versus temperature. Note the complex behavior exhibited by the “lowess” smoother; this is a warning that we may have trouble modeling this feature. Once again, in both scatter plots, we see the prevalence of outliers at the low end of bike demand. Exploring a Potential Interaction Perhaps there is an interaction between the time of day of working and nonworking days. A day of week effect is not apparent from Fig‐ ure 13, but we may need to look in more detail. This idea is easy to explore.  Adding  the  following  code  creates  box  plots  for  peak demand hours of working and nonworking days:   Explore bike demand for certain times on working and nonwork ing days     labels = ["Boxplots of bike demand at 0900 \n\n",                "Boxplots of bike demand at 1800 \n\n"]     times = [8, 17]     for lab, tms in zip labels, times :  24     Data Science in the Cloud with Microsoft Azure Machine Learning and Python           temp = BikeShare[BikeShare.hr == tms]         fig = plt.figure figsize= 8, 6           fig.clf           ax = fig.gca           temp.boxplot column = ['cnt'], by = ['isWorking'], ax  = ax          plt.xlabel ''          plt.ylabel 'Number of bikes'          plt.title lab          plt.show           if Azure == True : fig.savefig 'timeplot' + str tms  +  '.png'       return BikeShare  This  code  is  nearly  identical  to  the  code  we  already  discussed  for creating box plots. The only difference is the use of the by argument to create a separate box plot for working and nonworking days. Note  the  return  statement  at  the  end—Python  functions  require  a return statement. The result of running this code can be seen in Figures 16 and 17.  Figure 16. Box plots of bike demand at 0900 for working and non‐ working days  A Regression Example      25   Figure 17. Box plots of bike demand at 1800 for working and non‐ working days  Now  we  clearly  see  what  we  were  missing  in  the  initial  set  plots. There is a difference in demand between working and nonworking days at peak demand hours. Investigating a New Feature We  need  a  new  feature  that  differentiates  the  time  of  the  day  by working  and  nonworking  days.  The  feature  we  created,  xform‐ WorkHr, does just this.  We created a new variable using working versus non‐ working days. This leads to 48 levels  2 × 24  in this variable. We could have used the day of the week, but this approach would have created 168 levels  7 × 24 . Reducing the number of levels reduces complexity and the chance of overfitting—generally leading to a better model.  The  complex  hour-to-hour  variation  bike  demand,  shown  in  Fig‐ ure 11, may be difficult for some models to deal with. A shift in the  26     Data Science in the Cloud with Microsoft Azure Machine Learning and Python   time axis creates a new feature where demand is closer to a simple hump shape. The  resulting  new  feature  is  both  time-shifted  and  grouped  by working and nonworking hours, as shown in Figure 18. This plot shows a clear pattern of bike demand by the working  0– 23   and  nonworking   24–47   hour  of  the  day.  The  pattern  of demand  is  fairly  complex.  There  are  two  humps  corresponding  to peak commute times in the working hours. One fairly smooth hump characterizes nonworking hour demand.  Figure 18. Bike demand by transformed workTime  The  question  is  now:  Will  these  new  features  improve  the  perfor‐ mance of any of the models? A First Model Now that we have some basic data transformations and a first look at  the  data,  it’s  time  to  create  our  first  model.  Given  the  complex relationships  seen  in  the  data,  we  will  use  a  nonlinear  regression model.  In  particular,  we  will  try  the  Decision  Forest  Regression model. Figure 19 shows our Azure ML Studio canvas with all of the mod‐ ules in place.  A Regression Example      27   Figure 19. Azure ML Studio with first bike demand model  There are quite a few new modules on the canvas at this point. We added a Split module after the Transform Data Execute Python Script module. The sub-selected data are then sampled into training and test  evaluation  sets with a 70% 30% split. Later, we will intro‐ duce a second split to separate testing the model from evaluation. The test dataset is used for performing model parameter tuning and feature selection.  Pruning features There are a large number of apparently redundant features in this dataset. As we have seen, many of these features are highly correla‐ ted with each other. In all likelihood, models created with the full dataset will be overparameterized.  28     Data Science in the Cloud with Microsoft Azure Machine Learning and Python   The  selection  of  a  minimal  feature  set  is  of  critical importance.  The  danger  of  overparameterizing  or overfitting  a  model  is  always  present.  While  decision forest algorithms are known to be fairly insensitive to this  problem,  we  ignore  it  at  our  peril.  Dropping  fea‐ tures  that  do  little  to  improve  model  performance  is always a good idea. Features that are highly correlated with other features are especially good candidates for removal.  The  model  shown  in  Figure  19  includes  a  Permutation  Feature Importance module. The output of this module lists feature impor‐ tance measures in order from highest to lowest. One, or a few, fea‐ tures with the lowest absolute value of importance are pruned from the dataset. The experiment is run again, and the next feature or a few  features  are  pruned.  Continue  this  process  until  the  perfor‐ mance  metrics  produced  by  the  Evaluate  Model  module  become noticeably worse. A feature or few features may need to be restored to the dataset. At this point, we conclude that only essential features are  in  the  dataset.  Figure  20  shows  the  final  importance  measures for  the  puned  bike  sharing  dataset.  Note  that  the  importance  of these features is over a range of about an order of magnitude.  Figure 20. Importance of final feature selection  We  placed  the  Project  Columns  module  after  the  Split  module,  in order to prune the features we’re using without affecting the model evaluation. Use the Project Columns module to select the following columns of transformed data for the model:    cnt   xformHr  A Regression Example      29     temp   dteday  We have gone from 17 features to just 3 with very little change in the model performance metrics. The pruned feature set shows a signifi‐ cant reduction in complexity.  The Decision Forest Model Now that we have the feature set selected, let’s investigate the Deci‐ sion Forest Model and its performance. For the Decision Forest Regression module, we have set the follow‐ ing parameters:    Resampling method: Bagging   Number of decision trees: 40   Maximum depth: 32   Number of random splits: 128   Minimum number of samples per leaf: 10  The  model  is  scored  by  the  Score  Model  module,  which  provides predicted values for the module from the evaluation data. Figure 21 shows the performance summary statistics from the Evaluate Model module.  Figure 21. Performance statistics for the model  These results are interesting, but a bit abstract. Now,  we  include  another  Execute  Python  Script  module  in  our experiment.  The  Python  code  in  the  visualizeresids.py  file  creates charts for evaluating the performance of this model in more detail. As  we  did  before,  we  will  discuss  this  code  and  the  charts  it  pro‐ duces one step at a time.  As before, there must be a return state‐ ment at the end of any Python function.   30     Data Science in the Cloud with Microsoft Azure Machine Learning and Python   For the first step of this evaluation, we will compare the actual and predicted  values.  The  following  code  creates  a  scatter  plot  of  the residuals  errors  versus bike demand:  def azureml_main BikeShare :     import matplotlib     matplotlib.use 'agg'    Set backend     matplotlib.rcParams.update {'font.size': 20}       import matplotlib.pyplot as plt     import statsmodels.api as sm      Azure = False   Compute the residuals.         BikeShare['Resids']  =  BikeShare['Scored  Label  Mean']  -  BikeShare['cnt']   Plot the residuals vs the label, the count of rented bikes.     fig = plt.figure figsize= 8, 6       fig.clf       ax = fig.gca    PLot the residuals.     BikeShare.plot kind = 'scatter', x = 'cnt', y = 'Resids',                    alpha = 0.05, color = 'red', ax = ax      plt.xlabel "Days from start"      plt.ylabel "Residual"      plt.title "Residuals vs time"      plt.show       if Azure == True : fig.savefig 'scatter1.png'   This code does the following:    Sorts the data frame into time order.   Computes  a  new  column  in  the  Pandas  dataframe,  containing  the residuals.    Creates a scatter plot of the residuals versus bike demand  cnt ,  which is shown in Figure 22.  In Figure 22, you can see that most residuals are close to zero. There is a skew of the residuals toward the downside. In addition, there are some significant outliers. The largest outliers occur where demand has  been  overestimated  at  the  low  end  of  bike  demand.  There  are also some notable outliers where bike demand has been underesti‐ mated  at  higher  levels  of  bike  demand.  As  discussed  previously, underestimation  is  generally  more  of  a  problem  than  overestima‐ tion, unless the latter is extreme.  A Regression Example      31   Figure 22. Model residuals versus bike demand  To  run  this  code  in  Azure  ML,  make  sure  you  set Azure = True.  Next,  we  will  create  some  time  series  plots  of  both  actual  bike demand and the forecasted demand using the following code:   Make time series plots of actual bike demand and  predicted demand by times of the day.     times = [7, 9, 12, 15, 18, 20, 22]     for tm in times:         fig = plt.figure figsize= 8, 6           fig.clf           ax = fig.gca           BikeShare[BikeShare.hr == tm].plot kind = 'line',                                            x = 'dayCount', y =  'cnt',                                            ax = ax          BikeShare[BikeShare.hr == tm].plot kind = 'line',                                            x = 'dayCount', y =  'Scored Label Mean',                                            color = 'red', ax =  ax          plt.xlabel "Days from start of plot"          plt.ylabel "Count of bikes rented"          plt.title "Bikes rented by days for hour = " + str tm           plt.show    32     Data Science in the Cloud with Microsoft Azure Machine Learning and Python                   if Azure  ==  True :  fig.savefig 'tsplot'  +  str tm   +  '.png'   This code executes the following steps:  1. Creates a list of times. 2. A for loop iterates over these times. 3. Line plots are created for the actual and predicted bike demand   Scored Label Mean .  4. Saves the plot objects to files with unique names.  Some results of running this code are shown in Figures 23 and 24. By  examining  these  time  series  plots,  you  see  that  the  model produces  a  reasonably  good  fit  to  the  evaluation  data.  However, there are quite a few cases where the actual demand exceeds the pre‐ dicted demand.  Figure 23. Time series plot of actual and predicted bike demand at 0900  A Regression Example      33   Figure 24. Time series plot of actual and predicted bike demand at 1800  Let’s have a closer look at the residuals. The following code creates box  plots  of  the  residuals,  by  hour  and  by  the  48-hour  workTime scale:   Boxplots for the residuals by hour and transformed hour.     labels = ["Box plots of residuals by hour of the day \n\n",             "Box plots of residuals by transformed hour of the  day \n\n"]     xAxes = ["hr", "xformWorkHr"]     for lab, xaxs in zip labels, xAxes :         fig = plt.figure figsize= 12, 6           fig.clf           ax = fig.gca           BikeShare.boxplot column = ['Resids'], by = [xaxs], ax  = ax          plt.xlabel ''          plt.ylabel 'Residuals'          plt.show                   if Azure  ==  True :  fig.savefig 'boxplot'  +  xaxs  +  '.png'   This code executes the following steps:  1. Creates a list of figure captions. 2. Creates a list of column names.  34     Data Science in the Cloud with Microsoft Azure Machine Learning and Python   3. The for loop iterates over the captions and column names. 4. A box plot of the residuals is grouped by the column values. 5. Saves the plot object to a unique filename.  The results of running this code can be seen in Figures 25 and 26.  Figure 25. Box plots of residuals between actual and predicted values by hour  Figure 26. Box plots of residuals between actual and predicted values by transformed hour  Studying  these  plots,  we  see  there  are  significant  residuals  at  peak demand  hours.  The  model  consistently  underestimates  demand  at both  0900  and  1800—peak  commuting  hours  on  working  days. Clearly, to be useful, a bike sharing system should meet demand at  A Regression Example      35   these  peak  hours.  And  there  are  significant  negative  residuals  at midday on nonwork days. Finally, we create a Q-Q Normal plot and a histogram using the fol‐ lowing code:   QQ Normal plot of residuals     fig = plt.figure figsize =  6,6       fig.clf       ax = fig.gca       sm.qqplot BikeShare['Resids'], ax = ax      ax.set_title 'QQ Normal plot of residuals'      if Azure == True : fig.savefig 'QQ.png'      if Azure == True : fig.savefig 'QQ1.png'    Histograms of the residuals     fig = plt.figure figsize =  8,6       fig.clf       fig.clf       ax = fig.gca       ax.hist BikeShare['Resids'].as_matrix  , bins = 40      ax.set_xlabel "Residuals"      ax.set_ylabel "Density"      ax.set_title "Histogram of residuals"      if Azure == True : fig.savefig 'hist.png'       return BikeShare  This code performs the following steps:  1. Creates a Q-Q  quantile-quantile  Normal plot of the residuals. 2. Saves the plot object to a unique filename. 3. Creates a histogram of the residuals. 4. Saves the plot object to a unique filename.  The plots created are shown in Figures 27 and 28. Ideally, the residuals should have a small range and compact distri‐ bution. Both of these plots show significant outliers in the residuals. The Q-Q Normal plot shows the quantiles of the residuals against the  quantiles  of  a  theoretical  normal  distribution.  If  the  residuals were in fact normal and without any outliers, the points would lie on a straight line. In this case, the line shows significant curvature indicating non-Normal behavior and the presence of outliers. The histogram shows another view of the residuals. Once again, the out‐ liers in the residuals are clearly visible.  36     Data Science in the Cloud with Microsoft Azure Machine Learning and Python   Figure 27. Q-Q Normal plot of the model residuals  Figure 28. Histogram of the model residuals Improving the Model and Transformations The question is now: How can we improve these model results? It is possible that improvements in the choice of model parameters, or  Improving the Model and Transformations      37   an alternative model, might give better results. However, it is often the case that improved feature engineering and data cleaning leads to  greater  improvements  in  results,  rather  than  small  model improvements. In  this  section,  we  will  try  several  ideas  for  improvement:  better data  cleaning,  alternative  models,  and  better  selection  of  model parameters. Looking at the residuals in Figures 22, 25, 26, 27, and 28, as well as differences in the time series plots in Figures 23 and 24, you can see outliers  in  demand  on  the  low  side.  These  outliers  may  well  be  a source  of  bias  leading  to  the  model  underestimating  demand  in  a fair number of cases. Filtering with SQLite We can create a filter using the SQLite dialect of SQL in the Apply SQL  transformation  module.  The  experiment  with  the  apply  SQL transformation module is shown in Figure 29.  Figure 29. Experiment with Apply SQL Transformation module  In this case, we use a simple SQL script to trim small values from the training data.  select * from t1 where cnt > 100;  38     Data Science in the Cloud with Microsoft Azure Machine Learning and Python   This filter reduces the number of rows in the training dataset from about 12,000 to about 7,000. This filter is a rather blunt approach. Those versed in SQL can create more complex and precise queries to filter these data. In this report, we  will  turn  our  attention  to  creating  a  more  precise  filter  using Python. Another Data Transformation Let’s try another data transformation—filtering out the low-end out‐ liers.  To  wit,  we’ve  added  the  highlighted  Execute  Python  Script module, as shown in Figure 30. The code in this module will filter- out downside outliers in the training data.  Figure 30. Updated experiment with new Execute Python Script to trim outliers  We only want to apply this filter to the training data, and not to the evaluation data. When using the predictive model in production, we  Improving the Model and Transformations      39   are  computing  an  estimate  of  the  response,  and  will  not  have  the actual  response  values  to  trim.  Consequently,  the  new  Execute Python Script module is placed after the Split module. The code for this new Execute Python Script module is in the filter‐ data.py file and is shown here:  def azureml_main BikeShare :     import pandas as pd       Save the original names of the DataFrame.     in_names = list BikeShare        Compute the lower quantile of the number of biked grou ped by      Date and time values.         quantiles  =  BikeShare.groupby ['yr',  'mnth',  'xform WorkHr'] .cnt.quantile q = 0.2        Join  merge  quantiles as a DataFrame to BikeShare     quantiles = pd.DataFrame quantiles      BikeShare = pd.merge BikeShare, quantiles,                      left_on = ['yr', 'mnth', 'xformWorkHr'],                      right_index = True,                      how = 'inner'        Filter rows where the count of bikes is less than the  lower quantile.     BikeShare = BikeShare.ix[BikeShare.cnt_x > BikeShare.cnt_y]       Remove the unneeded column and restore the original col umn names.     BikeShare.drop 'cnt_y', axis = 1, inplace = True      BikeShare.columns = in_names       Sort the data frame based on the dayCount     BikeShare.sort 'dayCount',  axis = 0, inplace = True       return BikeShare  This  code  uses  the  following  steps  to  find  and  remove  downside outliers:  1. Saves the original column names in a list. 2. Computes the lower 20% quantile of the data grouped by the yr,  mnth, and xformWorkHour columns.  3. Filters  any  rows  where  the  total  number  of  bikes   cnt   is  less  than the 20% quantile.  40     Data Science in the Cloud with Microsoft Azure Machine Learning and Python   4. Removes  the  extraneous  column  and  restores  the  column  names.  5. Sorts the data frame in time order.  Evaluating the Improved Model Let’s look at the results of using this filter. As a first step, the sum‐ mary statistics produced by the Evaluate module are shown in Fig‐ ure 31.  Figure 31. Performance statistics for the model with outliers trimmed in the training data  When compared with the performance statistics shown in Figure 18, these figures are a bit worse. However, keep in mind that our goal is to limit the number of times we underestimate bike demand. This process will cause some degradation in the aggregate performance statistics, as bias is introduced. Let’s look in depth and see if we can make sense of these results. Fig‐ ures 32 and 33 show box plots of the residuals by hour of the day and by xformedWorkTime.  Figure 32. Residuals by hour with outliers trimmed in the training data  Improving the Model and Transformations      41   Figure 33. Residuals by workTime with outliers trimmed in the train‐ ing data  If you compare these residual plots with Figures 25 and 26, you will notice  that  the  residuals  are  now  biased  to  the  positive—this  is exactly what we hoped. It is better for users if the bike share system has a slight excess of inventory rather than a shortage.  By  now,  you  probably  realize  that  careful  study  of residuals  is  absolutely  essential  to  understanding  and improving  model  performance.  It  is  also  essential  to understand the business requirements when interpret‐ ing and improving predictive models.  Improving Model Parameter Selection in Azure ML We  can  try  improving  the  model’s  performance  by  searching  the parameter  space  with  the  Sweep  module.  Up  until  now,  all  of  our results have been based on initial guesses of the model parameters. The Sweep module searches the parameter space for the best combi‐ nation. The Sweep module has three input ports: one for the model, one for a training dataset, and one for a test dataset. Another Split module  is  required  to  resample  the  original  training  dataset.  As before, we only want to prune the outliers in the training data.  42     Data Science in the Cloud with Microsoft Azure Machine Learning and Python   The  updated  project,  with  the  new  module  shown  in  the  box,  is shown in Figure 34.  Figure 34. Experiment with new Split and Sweep modules added  The parameters for the Sweep module are as follows:    Specify parameter sweeping mode: Random Sweep   Maximum number of runs: 50   Selected column: cnt   Metric for measuring performance: Coefficient of determination  The Split module provides a 60% 40% split of the data.  Improving Model Parameter Selection in Azure ML      43   Before using the Sweep Parameters module, you must configure the machine learning module to enable mul‐ tiple  choices  of  values  for  the  parameters.  If  the machine  learning  module  is  not  configured  with multiple  parameter  value  choices,  sweeping  will  have no effect.  The Create trainer mode on the properties pane of the Decision For‐ est  Regression  module  is  set  to  Parameter  Range.  In  this  case,  we accept the default parameter value choices. The Range Builder tools allow you to configure different parameter value choices. After running the experiment, we see the results displayed in Fig‐ ure 35.  Figure 35. Performance statistics produced by sweeping the model parameters  The  box  plots  of  the  residuals  by  hour  of  the  day  and  by  xform‐ WorkTime are shown in Figures 36 and 37.  Figure 36. Box plots of residuals by hour after sweeping parameters  44     Data Science in the Cloud with Microsoft Azure Machine Learning and Python   Figure 37. Box plots of residuals by workTime after sweeping parame‐ ters  These  results  are  marginally  better  than  before.  The  plot  of  the residuals is virtually indistinguishable from Figures 32 and 33. Cross Validation Let’s test the performance of our better model in depth. We’ll use the Azure  ML  Cross  Validation  module.  In  summary,  cross  validation resamples the dataset multiple times into nonoverlapping folds. The model  is  recomputed  and  rescored  for  each  fold.  This  procedure provides multiple estimates of model performance. These estimates are averaged to produce a more reliable performance estimate. Dis‐ persion measures of the performance metrics provide some insight into how well the model will generalize in production. The updated experiment is shown in Figure 38. Note the addition of the  Cross  Validate  Model  module.  The  dataset  used  by  the  model comes from the output of the Project Columns model, to ensure the same features are used for model training and cross validation. After running the experiment, the output of the Evaluation Results by Fold is shown in Figure 39. These results are encouraging. The two leftmost columns in the box are Relative Squared Error and Coefficient of Determination. The fold number is in the rightmost column.  Cross Validation      45   Figure 38. Experiment with Cross Validation module added  Examine  the  bottom  two  rows,  showing  the  Mean  and  Standard Deviation  of  the  performance  metrics.  The  mean  values  of  these metrics are better than those achieved previously, which is a bit sur‐ prising. However, keep in mind that we are only using a subset of the data for the cross validation. Finally, notice the consistency of the metrics across the folds. The values of each metric are in a narrow range. Additionally, the stan‐ dard  deviations  of  the  metrics  are  significantly  smaller  than  the means.  These  figures  indicate  that  the  model  produces  consistent results across the folds, and should generalize well in production.  46     Data Science in the Cloud with Microsoft Azure Machine Learning and Python   Figure 39. The results by fold of the model cross validation Some Possible Next Steps It is always possible to do more when refining a predictive model. The  question  must  always  be:  Is  it  worth  the  effort  for  the  possible improvement?  The  median  performance  of  the  decision  forest regression model is fairly good. However, there are some significant outliers  in  the  residuals.  Thus,  some  additional  effort  is  probably justified before either model is put into production. There is a lot to think about when trying to improve the results. We could consider several possible next steps, including the following: Understand the source of the residual outliers  We have not investigated if there are systematic sources of these outliers.  Are  there  certain  ranges  of  predictor  variable  values that give these erroneous results? Do the outliers correspond to exogenous events, such as parades and festivals, failures of other public  transit,  holidays  that  are  not  indicated  as  nonworking days, etc.? Such an investigation will require additional data.  Perform additional feature engineering  We  have  tried  a  few  obvious  new  features  with  some  success, but there is no reason to think this process has run its course. Perhaps  another  time  axis  transformation,  which  orders  the  Some Possible Next Steps      47   hour-to-hour variation in demand would perform better. Some moving averages might reduce the effects of the outliers.  Prune features to prevent overfitting  Overfitting  is  a  major  source  of  poor  model  performance.  As noted earlier, we have pruned some features. Perhaps, a differ‐ ent pruning of the features would give a better result.  Change the quantile of the outlier filter  We arbitrarily chose the 0.20 quantile, but it could easily be the case that another value might give better performance. It is also possible that some other type of filter might help.  Try some other models  Azure ML has a number of other nonlinear regression modules. Further, we have tried only one of many possible Python scikit- learn models we could try.  Publishing a Model as a Web Service Now that we have a reasonably good model, we can publish it as a web service. A schematic view has been presented in Figure 5. Publishing an Azure ML experiment as a web service is remarkably easy. As illustrated in Figure 40, simply push the Setup Web Service but‐ ton on the righthand side of the tool bar at the bottom of the studio window. Then select Predictive Web Service. A  Predictive  Experiment  is  automatically  created,  as  illustrated  in Figure  41.  Unnecessary  modules  have  been  pruned  and  the  web services input and output models are added automatically. A Project Columns module has been manually added to this experi‐ ment, just before the Web services output module. This module is used to select just the Scored Label Mean and Scored Label Standard Deviation columns. This filtering prevents all of the other columns in the input schema from being duplicated in the response to a web services request.  48     Data Science in the Cloud with Microsoft Azure Machine Learning and Python   Figure 40. The Setup web services button in Azure ML studio  The predictive experiment should be run to test it. By clicking on the Deploy Web Services icon on the left side of the studio canvas, a page showing a list of published web services appears. Click on the line for the web bicycle demand forecasting service and the display shown in Figure 42 appears.  Publishing a Model as a Web Service      49   Figure 41.

Web service page for bike demand forecasting  50     Data Science in the Cloud with Microsoft Azure Machine Learning and Python   On this page, you can see a number of properties and tools:    An API key, used by external applications to access this predic‐ tive model. To ensure security, manage the distribution of this key carefully!    A  link  to  a  page  which  describes  the  request-response  REST API. This document includes sample code in C, Python, and R.   A link to a page which describes the batch API. This document  includes sample code in C, Python, and R.    A test button for manually testing the web service.   An Excel download.  Let’s  start  an  Excel  workbook  and  test  the  Azure  ML  web  service API. In this case, we will use Excel Online. Once a blank workbook is opened, download the Azure ML plug-in following these steps:  1. From the Insert menu, select More Features, Add-ins. 2. In the dialog, select Store and search for Azure Machine Learn‐  ing.  3. Download the plug-in, select Trust it. 4. Select + Web service. 5. Copy and paste the Request Response Link Address URL  not  the URL of the web services properties page  and the API key.  6. Click Add. 7. Click on Use Sample Data on the plug-in.  After  clicking  on  Use  Sample  Data  on  the  plug-in,  the  workbook appears as shown in Figure 43. Note: the column names of the input schema appear. We can now compute predicted label and label standard deviation values using the Azure ML web service, by following these steps:  1. Copy  a  few  rows  of  data  from  the  original  dataset  and  paste them into the appropriate cells of the workbook containing the plug-in.  2. Select the range of input data cells, making sure to include the  header row and that it is selected as the Input for the plug-in.  Publishing a Model as a Web Service      51   3. Select the first output cell  for the header row  as the Output. 4. Click the Predict button.  The result can be seen in Figure 44.  Figure 43. Excel workbook with Azure ML plug-in configured  Figure 44. Workbook with input data and predicted values  The label values  cnt  and the predicted values  Scored Label Mean  are  shown  in  the  highlight.  You  can  see  that  the  newly  computed predicted values are reasonably close to the actual values. Publishing  machine  learning  models  as  web  services  make  the results available to a wide audience. The Predictive Experiment runs in  the  highly  scalable  and  secure  Azure  cloud.  The  API  key  is encrypted  in  the  plug-in,  allowing  wide  distribution  of  the  work‐ book. With very few steps, we have created a machine learning web service and tested it from an Excel workbook. The Training Experiment and  52     Data Science in the Cloud with Microsoft Azure Machine Learning and Python   Predictive  Experiment  can  be  updated  at  any  time.  As  long  as  the input and output schema remains constant, updates to the models are transparent to users of the web service. Using Jupyter Notebooks with Azure ML Python users can interact with data in the Azure Machine Learning environment using Jupyter notebooks. Notebooks provide a highly interactive  environment  for  the  exploration  and  modeling  of  data. Jupyter notebooks can be shared with colleagues as a reproducible document  showing  your  analyses.  You  can  find  more  information on the Jupyter project, including tutorials, at the jupyter.org website. As  of  the  release  date  for  this  report,  the  Azure  ML  Jupyter  note‐ book capability is in preview release. Here is a tutorial for Jupyter with Azure ML. In Azure ML, any dataset in the form of a .csv file can be exported to a Jupyter notebook. Figure 45 shows our experiment with a Convert to  csv  module  added.  The  Jupyter  notebook  using  Python  2  is opened from the output of this new module.  Figure 45. Opening a Jupyter notebook from an experiment  Using Jupyter Notebooks with Azure ML      53   Figure 46 shows the new Jupyter notebook open in a browser win‐ dow.

Open Jupyter notebook  Using  some  markdown  to  anotate  the  analysis  steps  and  adding some  Python  code  from  the  visualizeresids.py  file,  we  can  plot  the residuals of the model versus bike demand. The result is shown in Figure 47.  Figure 47. Creating a plot interactively in a Jupyter notebook  54     Data Science in the Cloud with Microsoft Azure Machine Learning and Python   Clearly,  there  is  a  lot  more  you  can  do  with  these  notebooks  for analysis and modeling of datasets. Summary To summarize our discussion:    Azure  ML  is  an  easy-to-use  environment  for  the  creation  and  cloud deployment of powerful machine learning solutions.    Analytics  written  in  Python  can  be  rapidly  operationalized  as  web services using Azure ML.    Python code is readily integrated into the Azure ML workflow.   Understanding  business  goals  and  requirements  is  essential  to  the creation of a valuable analytic solution.    Careful  development,  selection,  and  filtering  of  features  is  the  key to creating successful data science solutions.    A clear understanding of residuals is essential to the evaluation  and improvement of machine learning model performance.    You can create and test an Azure ML web service with just a few point-and-click  operations;  the  resulting  notebook  can  be widely distributed to end users.    Jupyter  notebook  allows  you  to  interactively  analyze  data  in  a reproducible environment, with the Python kernel running on the Azure ML platform.
