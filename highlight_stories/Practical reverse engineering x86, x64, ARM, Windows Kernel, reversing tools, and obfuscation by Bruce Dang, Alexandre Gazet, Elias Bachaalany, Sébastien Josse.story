The book represents something that we  wish we had when we started learning about reverse engineering more than 15  years ago. At the time, there was a dearth of books and online resources  there  were no blogs back then ; we learned the art primarily through friends and  independent trial-and-error experiments. The information security “industry”  was also non-existent back then. Today, the world is different. We now have  decompilers, web scanners, static source scanners, cloud  ? , and APTs  unthink- able! . Numerous blogs, forums, books, and in-person classes aim to teach reverse  engineering.  These resources vary greatly in quality. Some are sub-standard  but shamelessly published or offered to take advantage of the rise in demand  for computer security; some are of extremely high quality but not well attended  read due to lack of advertising, specialization or because they are simply “too  esoteric.” There is not a unifying resource that people can use as the foundation  for learning reverse engineering. We hope this book is that foundation.  Now for the best part, acknowledging the people who helped us arrive at  where we are today. All of the authors would like to acknowledge Rolf Rolles  for his contributions to the obfuscation chapter. Rolf is a real pioneer in the  fi eld of reverse engineering. His seminal work on virtual machine deobfusca- tion, applying program analysis to reverse engineering, and binary analysis  education infl uenced and inspired a new generation of reverse engineers. We  hope that he will continue to contribute to the fi eld and inspire others to do the  same. Next, we would also like to thank Matt Miller, our comrade and techni- cal reviewer. Matt is another true pioneer in our fi eld and has made seminal  contributions to exploit mitigations in Windows. His dedication to details and  helping others learn should be a model for all.  Finally, we would like to thank  Carol Long, John Sleeva, Luann Rouff, and the staff at John Wiley & Sons for  putting up with us through the publishing process.   — The authors  xiii  ffi rs.indd  11:7:25:AM  01 21 2014  Page xiii   xiv   Acknowledgments  I would like to thank my parents for their sacrifi ces to give me better opportuni- ties in life; my sister and brother, Ivy Dang and Donald Dang, for being a constant  source of support and inspiration; and Rolf Rolles for being a good friend and  source of reason all these years. I did not have many role models growing up, but  the following people directly helped shape my perspectives: Le Thanh Sang, Vint  Cerf, and Douglas Comer. At university, I learned the joy of Chinese literature  from David Knetchges, Buddhist studies from Kyoko Tokuno, Indian history from  Richard Salomon  who would have thought so much can be learned from rocks  and coins! , Central Asian history from Daniel Waugh, and Chinese language  from Nyan-Ping Bi. While they are not reverse engineers, their enthusiasm and  dedication forever inspired and made me a better human being and engineer. If  I had met them earlier, my career path would probably be very different.  Through the journey of professional life, I was fortunate enough to meet  intelligent people who infl uenced me  in no particular order : Alex Carp, rebel,  Navin Pai, Jonathan Ness, Felix Domke, Karl J., Julien Tinnes, Josh Phillips, Daniel  Radu, Maarten Boone, Yoann Guillot, Ivanlef0u  thanks for hosting us , Richard  van Eeden, Dan Ho, Andy Renk, Elia Florio, Ilfak Guilfanov, Matt Miller, David  Probert, Damian Hasse, Matt Thomlinson, Shawn Hoffman, David Dittrich, Eloi  Vanderbeken, LMH, Ali Rahbar, Fermin Serna, Otto Kivling, Damien Aumaitre,  Tavis Ormandy, Ali Pezeshk, Gynvael Coldwind, anakata  a rare genius , Richard  van Eeden, Noah W., Ken Johnson, Chengyun Yu, Elias Bachaalany, Felix von  Leitner, Michal Chmielewski, sectorx, Son Pho Nguyen, Nicolas Pouvesle, Kostya  Kortchinsky, Peter Viscerola, Torbjorn L., Gustavo di Scotti, Sergiusz Fonrobert,  Peter W., Ilja van Sprundel, Brian Cavenah, upb, Maarten Van Horenbeeck, Robert  Hensing, Cristian Craioveanu, Claes Nyberg, Igor Skorchinsky, John Lambert,  Mark Wodrich  role model Buddhist , David Midturi, Gavin Thomas, Sebastian  Porst, Peter Vel, Kevin Broas, Michael Sandy, Christer Oberg, Mateusz “j00ru”  Jurczyk, David Ross, and Raphael Rigo. Jonathan Ness and Damian Hasse  were always supportive of me doing things differently and constantly gave me  opportunities to fail succeed. If I forgot you, please forgive me.  The following people directly provided feedback and improved the initial  drafts of my chapters: Michal Chmielewski, Shawn Hoffman, Nicolas Pouvesle,  Matt Miller, Alex Ionescu, Mark Wodrich, Ben Byer, Felix Domke, Ange Albertini,  Igor Skorchinsky, Peter Ferrie, Lien Duong, iZsh, Frank Boldewin, Michael Hale  Ligh, Sebastien Renaud, Billy McCourt, Peter Viscerola, Dennis Elser, Thai Duong,  Eloi Vanderbeken, Raphael Rigo, Peter Vel, and Bradley Spengler  a true over- achiever . Without their insightful comments and suggestions, most of the book  would be unreadable. Of course, you can blame me for the remaining mistakes. There are numerous other unnamed people that contributed to my knowledge   and therefore this book.  I also want to thank Molly Reed and Tami Needham from The Omni Group  for giving us a license of OmniGraffl e to make illustrations in the earlier drafts.  ffi rs.indd  11:7:25:AM  01 21 2014  Page xiv      Acknowledgments   xv  Last but not least, I want to thank Alex, Elias, and Sébastien for helping me  with this book. Without them, the book would have never seen the light of day.  — Bruce  First, I would like to thank Bruce Dang for inviting me to take part in this  great project. It has been a long and enriching journey. Rolf Rolles was there  at fi rst, and I personally thank him for the countless hours we spent together  imagining the obfuscation chapter and collecting material. Sébastien Josse then  agreed to joined us; his contribution is invaluable and our chapter wouldn’t be  the same without him. Thank you, Seb.  I also want to thank my friends Fabrice Desclaux, Yoann Guillot, and Jean-  Philippe Luyten for their invaluable feedback.  Finally, thanks to Carol Long for making this book possible, and to John   Sleeva for keeping us on track.   — Alexandre  I want to start by thanking Bruce Dang, my friend and colleague, for giving  me the chance to participate in this endeavor. I also want to thank all my friends  and colleagues for their support and help. In particular, I would like to thank  Daniel Pistelli  CEO of Cerbero GmbH , Michal Chmielewski, Swamy Shivaganga  Nagaraju, and Alexandre Gazet for their technical input and feedback during  the writing of the book.  I want to thank Mr. Ilfak Guilfanov  CEO of Hex-Rays SA . I learned a lot from  him while working at Hex-Rays. His hard work, patience, and perseverance to  create IDA Pro will always be an inspiration to me.  A big thanks to John Wiley & Sons for giving us the opportunity to publish  this book. Thanks also to the acquisition editor Carol Long for her prompt and  professional assistance, and to the project editor John Sleeva and copy editor  Luann Rouff for their energy, patience, and hard work.  I want to thank Alexandre, Elias, and Bruce for giving me the opportunity to  contribute to this book. I also want to thank Jean-Philippe Luyten for putting  us in touch.

The fi rst phase of learning a foreign language begins  with an introduction to letters in the alphabet, which are used to construct  words with well-defi ned semantics. The next phase involves understanding  the grammatical rules governing how words are glued together to produce a  proper sentence. After being accustomed to these rules, one then learns how to  stitch multiple sentences together to articulate complex thoughts. Eventually it  reaches the point where the learner can read large books written in different  styles and still understand the thoughts therein. At this point, one can read  reference books on the more esoteric aspects of the language—historical syntax,  phonology, and so on.  In reverse engineering, the language is the architecture and assembly lan- guage. A word is an assembly instruction. Paragraphs are sequences of assembly  instructions. A book is a program. However, to fully understand a book, the  reader needs to know more than just vocabulary and grammar. These additional  elements include structure and style of prose, unwritten rules of writing, and  others. Understanding computer programs also requires a mastery of concepts  beyond assembly instructions.  It can be somewhat intimidating to start learning an entirely new technical  subject from a book. However, we would be misleading you if we were to claim  that reverse engineering is a simple learning endeavor and that it can be com- pletely mastered by reading this book. The learning process is quite involved  because it requires knowledge from several disparate domains of knowledge. For  example, an effective reverse engineer needs to be knowledgeable in computer  architecture, systems programming, operating systems, compilers, and so on;  for certain areas, a strong mathematical background is necessary. So how do you   xxiii  fl ast.indd  08:38:14:AM  01 21 2014  Page xxiii   xxiv   Introduction  know where to start? The answer depends on your experience and skills. Because  we cannot accommodate everyone’s background, this introduction outlines the  learning and reading methods for those without any programming background.  You should fi nd your “position” in the spectrum and start from there.  For the sake of discussion, we loosely defi ne reverse engineering as the pro- cess of understanding a system. It is a problem-solving process. A system can  be a hardware device, a software program, a physical or chemical process,  and so on. For the purposes of the book, the system is a software program.  To understand a program, you must fi rst understand how software is written.  Hence, the fi rst requirement is knowing how to program a computer through  a language such as C, C++, Java, and others. We suggest fi rst learning C due  to its simplicity, effectiveness, and ubiquity. Some excellent references to con- sider are The C  Programming Language, by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie   Prentice Hall, 1988  and C: A Reference Manual, by Samuel Harbison  Prentice  Hall, 2002 . After becoming comfortable with writing, compiling, and debug- ging basic programs, consider reading Expert C Programming: Deep C Secrets, by  Peter van der Linden  Prentice Hall, 1994 . At this point, you should be familiar  with high-level concepts such as variables, scopes, functions, pointers, condi- tionals, loops, call stacks, and libraries. Knowledge of data structures such as  stacks, queues, linked lists, and trees might be useful, but they are not entirely  necessary for now. To top it off, you might skim through Compilers: Principles,  Techniques, and Tools, by Alfred Aho, Ravi Sethi, and Jeffrey Ullman,  Prentice  Hall, 1994  and Linkers and Loaders, by John Levine  Morgan Kaufmann, 1999 ,  to get a better understanding of how a program is really put together. The key  purpose of reading these books is to gain exposure to basic concepts; you do  not have to understand every page for now  there will be time for that later .  Overachievers should consider Advanced Compiler Design and Implementation, by  Steven Muchnick  Morgan Kaufmann, 1997 .  Once you have a good understanding of how programs are generally written,  executed, and debugged, you should begin to explore the program’s execution  environment, which includes the processor and operating system. We suggest  fi rst learning about the Intel processor by skimming through Intel 64 and IA-32  Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1: Basic Architecture by Intel, with  special attention to Chapters 2–7. These chapters explain the basic elements of a  modern computer. Readers interested in ARM should consider Cortex-A Series  Programmer’s Guide and ARM Architecture Reference Manual ARMv7-A and ARMv7-R  Edition by ARM. While our book covers x86 x64 ARM, we do not discuss every  architectural detail.  We assume that the reader will refer to these manuals,  as necessary.  In skimming through these manuals, you should have a basic  appreciation of the technical building blocks of a computing system. For a more  conceptual understanding, consider Structured Computer Organization by Andrew  Tanenbaum  Prentice Hall, 1998 . All readers should also consult the Microsoft PE   fl ast.indd  08:38:14:AM  01 21 2014  Page xxiv      Introduction   xxv  and COFF Specifi cation. At this point, you will have all the necessary background  to read and understand Chapter 1, “x86 and x64,” and Chapter 2, “ARM.”  Next, you should explore the operating system. There are many different  operating systems, but they share many common concepts including processes,  threads, virtual memory, privilege separation, multi-tasking, and so on. The  best way to understand these concepts is to read Modern Operating Systems, by  Andrew Tanenbaum  Prentice Hall, 2005 . Although Tanenbaum’s text is excellent  for concepts, it does not discuss important technical details for real-life operat- ing systems. For Windows, you should consider skimming through Windows  NT Device Driver Development, by Peter Viscarola and Anthony Mason  New  Riders Press, 1998 ; although it is a book on driver development, the background  chapters provide an excellent and concrete introduction to Windows.  It is also  excellent supplementary material for the Windows kernel chapter in this book.   For additional inspiration  and an excellent treatment of the Windows memory  manager , you should also read What Makes It Page? The Windows 7  x64  Virtual  Memory Manager, by Enrico Martignetti  CreateSpace Independent Publishing  Platform, 2012 .  At this point, you would have all the necessary background to read and under- stand Chapter 3 “The Windows Kernel.” You should also consider learning Win32  programming. Windows System Programming, by Johnson Hart  Addison-Wesley  Professional, 2010 , and Windows via C C++, by Jeffrey Richter and Christophe  Nasarre  Microsoft Press, 2007 , are excellent references.  For Chapter 4, “Debugging and Automation,” consider Inside Windows  Debugging: A Practical Guide to Debugging and Tracing Strategies in Windows, by  Tarik Soulami  Microsoft Press, 2012 , and Advanced Windows Debugging, by  Mario Hewardt and Daniel Pravat  Addison-Wesley Professional, 2007 .  Chapter 5, “Obfuscation,” requires a good understanding of assembly language  and should be read after the x86 x64 ARM chapters. For background knowledge,  consider Surreptitious Software: Obfuscation, Watermarking, and Tamperproofi ng for  Software Protection, by Christian Collberg and Jasvir Nagra  Addison-Wesley  Professional, 2009 .  N O T E  This book includes exercises and walk-throughs with real, malicious viruses  and rootkits. We intentionally did this to ensure that readers can immediately apply  their newly learned skills. The malware samples are referenced in alphabetical order   Sample A, B, C, ... , and you can ﬁ nd the corresponding SHA1 hashes in the Appendix.  Because there may be legal concerns about distributing such samples with the book,  we decided not to do so; however, you can download these samples by searching vari- ous malware repositories, such as www.malware.lu, or request them from the forums  at http:  kernelmode.info. Many of the samples are from famous hacking inci- dents that made worldwide news, so they should be interesting. Perhaps some enthu- siastic readers will gather all the samples in a package and share them on BitTorrent.   fl ast.indd  08:38:14:AM  01 21 2014  Page xxv   xxvi   Introduction  If none of those options work for you, please feel free to email the authors. Make sure  that you analyze these in a safe environment to prevent accidental self-infection.      In addition, to familiarize you with Metasm, we've prepared two exercise scripts:  symbolic-execution-lvl1.rb and symbolic-execution-lvl2.rb.  Answering the questions will lead you to a journey in Metasm internals. You can ﬁ nd  the scripts at www.wiley.com go practicalreverseengineering.      It is important to realize that the exercises are a vital component of the book. The  book was intentionally written in this way. If you simply read the book without doing  the exercises, you will not understand or retain much. You should feel free to blog or  write about your answers so that others can learn from them; you can post them on the  Reverse Engineering reddit  www.reddit.com r ReverseEngineering  and get  feedback from the community  and maybe the authors . If you successfully complete all  of the exercises, pat yourself on the back and then send Bruce your resume.  The journey of becoming an effective reverse engineer is long and time con- suming, requiring patience and endurance. You may fail many times along  the way  by not understanding concepts or by failing to complete exercises in  this book , but don’t give up. Remember: Failing is part of success. With this  guidance and the subsequent chapters, you should be well prepared for the  learning journey.

For the  purpose of our chapter, x86 is the 32-bit implementation of the Intel architecture   IA-32  as defi ned in the Intel Software Development Manual. Generally speaking,  it can operate in two modes: real and protected. Real mode is the processor state  when it is fi rst powered on and only supports a 16-bit instruction set. Protected  mode is the processor state supporting virtual memory, paging, and other  features; it is the state in which modern operating systems execute. The 64-bit  extension of the architecture is called x64 or x86-64.  This chapter discusses the  x86 architecture operating in protected mode.  x86 supports the concept of privilege separation through an abstraction called  ring level. The processor supports four ring levels, numbered from 0 to 3.  Rings  1 and 2 are not commonly used so they are not discussed here.  Ring 0 is the  highest privilege level and can modify all system settings. Ring 3 is the lowest  privileged level and can only read modify a subset of system settings. Hence,  modern operating systems typically implement user kernel privilege separation   1  c01.indd  03:58:11:PM  01 16 2014  Page 1   2   Chapter 1   x86 and x64  by having user-mode applications run in ring 3, and the kernel in ring 0. The  ring level is encoded in the CS register and sometimes referred to as the current  privilege level  CPL  in offi cial documentation.  This chapter discusses the x86 IA-32 architecture as defi ned in the Intel 64  and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volumes 1–3  www.intel .com content www us en processors architectures-software-developer- manuals.html .  Register Set and Data Types  When operating in protected mode, the x86 architecture has eight 32-bit general- purpose registers  GPRs : EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX, EDI, ESI, EBP, and ESP. Some of  them can be further divided into 8- and 16-bit registers. The instruction pointer  is stored in the EIP register. The register set is illustrated in Figure 1-1. Table 1-1  describes some of these GPRs and how they are used.  31  7  0  31  0  15 EAX  ESI  EDI  AH  AL  AX  SI  DI  15 EBP  ESP  EIP  EFLAGS  BP  SP  Figure 1-1  ECX  ESI  EDI  EBP  ESP  Table 1-1: Some GPRs and Their Usage  REGISTER  PURPOSE  Counter in loops  Source in string memory operations  Destination in string memory operations  Base frame pointer  Stack pointer  c01.indd  03:58:11:PM  01 16 2014  Page 2      Chapter 1   x86 and x64   3  The common data types are as follows:    Bytes—8 bits. Examples: AL, BL, CL    Word—16 bits. Examples: AX, BX, CX    Double word—32 bits. Examples: EAX, EBX, ECX    Quad word—64 bits. While x86 does not have 64-bit GPRs, it can combine  two registers, usually EDX:EAX, and treat them as 64-bit values in some sce- narios. For example, the RDTSC instruction writes a 64-bit value to EDX:EAX.  The 32-bit EFLAGS register is used to store the status of arithmetic operations  and other execution states  e.g., trap fl ag . For example, if the previous “add”  operation resulted in a zero, the ZF fl ag will be set to 1. The fl ags in EFLAGS are  primarily used to implement conditional branching.  In addition to the GPRs, EIP, and EFLAGS, there are also registers that control  important low-level system mechanisms such as virtual memory, interrupts, and  debugging. For example, CR0 controls whether paging is on or off, CR2 contains  the linear address that caused a page fault, CR3 is the base address of a paging  data structure, and CR4 controls the hardware virtualization settings. DR0–DR7  are used to set memory breakpoints. We will come back to these registers later  in the “System Mechanism” section.  N O T E  Although there are seven debug registers, the system allows only four mem- ory breakpoints  DR0–DR3 . The remaining registers are used for status.  There are also model-specifi c registers  MSRs . As the name implies, these  registers may vary between different processors by Intel and AMD. Each MSR  is identifi ed by name and a 32-bit number, and read written to through the  RDMSR WRMSR instructions. They are accessible only to code running in ring 0 and  typically used to store special counters and implement low-level functionality.  For example, the SYSENTER instruction transfers execution to the address stored  in the IA32_SYSENTER_EIP MSR  0x176 , which is usually the operating system’s  system call handler. MSRs are discussed throughout the book as they come up.  The x86 instruction set allows a high level of fl exibility in terms of data move- ment between registers and memory. The movement can be classifi ed into fi ve  general methods:  Instruction Set     Immediate to register    Register to register    Immediate to memory  c01.indd  03:58:11:PM  01 16 2014  Page 3   4   Chapter 1   x86 and x64     Register to memory and vice versa    Memory to memory  The fi rst four methods are supported by all modern architectures, but the last  one is specifi c to x86. A classical RISC architecture like ARM can only read write  data from to memory with load store instructions  LDR and STR, respectively ;  for example, a simple operation like incrementing a value in memory requires  three instructions:    1.  Read the data from memory to a register  LDR .   2.  Add one to the register  ADD .   3.  Write the register to memory  STR .   On x86, such an operation would require only one instruction  either INC or  ADD  because it can directly access memory. The MOVS instruction can read and  write memory at the same time. ARM  01: 1B 68         LDR      R3, [R3] ; read the value at address R3 02: 5A 1C         ADDS     R2, R3, 1 ; add 1 to it 03: 1A 60         STR      R2, [R3] ; write updated value back to address R3  x86  01: FF 00         inc      dword ptr [eax] ; directly increment value at address EAX  Another important characteristic is that x86 uses variable-length instruction  size: the instruction length can range from 1 to 15 bytes. On ARM, instructions  are either 2 or 4 bytes in length.  Syntax Depending on the assembler disassembler, there are two syntax notations for  x86 assembly code, Intel and AT&T: Intel  mov ecx, AABBCCDDh mov ecx, [eax] mov ecx, eax  AT&T  movl $0xAABBCCDD, %ecx movl  %eax , %ecx movl %eax, %ecx  c01.indd  03:58:11:PM  01 16 2014  Page 4      Chapter 1   x86 and x64   5  It is important to note that these are the same instructions but written differ- ently. There are several differences between Intel and AT&T notation, but the  most notable ones are as follows:     AT&T prefi xes the register with %, and immediates with $. Intel does not      AT&T adds a prefi x to the instruction to indicate operation width. For   example, MOVL  long , MOVB  byte , etc. Intel does not do this.     AT&T puts the source operand before the destination. Intel reverses the   do this.  order.  Disassemblers assemblers and other reverse-engineering tools  IDA Pro,  OllyDbg, MASM, etc.  on Windows typically use Intel notation, whereas those  on UNIX frequently follow AT&T notation  GCC . In practice, Intel notation is  the dominant form and is used throughout this book.  Data Movement Instructions operate on values that come from registers or main memory. The  most common instruction for moving data is MOV. The simplest usage is to move  a register or immediate to register. For example:  01: BE 3F 00 0F 00   mov   esi, 0F003Fh ; set ESI = 0xF003 02: 8B F1            mov   esi, ecx     ; set ESI = ECX  The next common usage is to move data to from memory. Similar to other  assembly language conventions, x86 uses square brackets  []  to indicate memory  access.  The only exception to this is the LEA instruction, which uses [] but does  not actually reference memory.  Memory access can be specifi ed in several dif- ferent ways, so we will begin with the simplest case: Assembly  01: C7 00 01 00 00+  mov   dword ptr [eax], 1 ; set the memory at address EAX to 1 02: 8B 08            mov   ecx, [eax] ; set ECX to the value at address EAX 03: 89 18            mov   [eax], ebx ; set the memory at address EAX to EBX 04: 89 46 34         mov   [esi+34h], eax ; set the memory address at  ESI+34  to EAX 05: 8B 46 34         mov   eax, [esi+34h] ; set EAX to the value at address  EAX+34  06: 8B 14 01         mov   edx, [ecx+eax] ; set EDX to the value at address  ECX+EAX   c01.indd  03:58:11:PM  01 16 2014  Page 5   6   Chapter 1   x86 and x64  Pseudo C  01: *eax = 1; 02: ecx = *eax; 03: *eax = ebx; 04: * esi+34  = eax; 05: eax = * esi+34 ; 06: edx = * ecx+eax ;  These examples demonstrate memory access through a base register and  offset, where offset can be a register or immediate. This form is commonly used  to access structure members or data buffers at a location computed at runtime.  For example, suppose that ECX points to a structure of type KDPC with the layout  kd> dt nt!_KDPC    +0x000 Type             : UChar    +0x001 Importance       : UChar    +0x002 Number           : Uint2B    +0x004 DpcListEntry     : _LIST_ENTRY    +0x00c DeferredRoutine  : Ptr32     void    +0x010 DeferredContext  : Ptr32 Void    +0x014 SystemArgument1  : Ptr32 Void    +0x018 SystemArgument2  : Ptr32 Void    +0x01c DpcData          : Ptr32 Void  and used in the following context:  Assembly  01: 8B 45 0C         mov   eax, [ebp+0Ch] 02: 83 61 1C 00      and   dword ptr [ecx+1Ch], 0 03: 89 41 0C         mov   [ecx+0Ch], eax 04: 8B 45 10         mov   eax, [ebp+10h] 05: C7 01 13 01 00+  mov   dword ptr [ecx], 113h 06: 89 41 10         mov   [ecx+10h], eax  Pseudo C  KDPC *p = ...; p->DpcData = NULL; p->DeferredRoutine = ...; * int * p = 0x113; p->DeferredContext = ...;  Line 1 reads a value from memory and stores it in EAX. The DeferredRoutine  fi eld is set to this value in line 3. Line 2 clears the DpcData fi eld by AND’ing it   c01.indd  03:58:11:PM  01 16 2014  Page 6      Chapter 1   x86 and x64   7  with 0. Line 4 reads another value from memory and stores it in EAX. The  DeferredContext fi eld is set to this value in line 6.  Line 5 writes the double-word value 0x113 to the base of the structure. Why  does it write a double-word value at the base if the fi rst fi eld is only 1 byte in  size? Wouldn’t that implicitly set the Importance and Number fi elds as well? The  answer is yes. Figure 1-2 shows the result of converting 0x113 to binary.  00000000 00000000  Number Figure 1-2  00000000 00000000 00000001 00010011   00000001  Importance  00010011  Type  The Type fi eld is set to 0x13  bold bits , Importance is set to 0x1  underlined  bits , and Number is set to 0x0  the remaining bits . By writing one value, the code  managed to initialize three fi elds with a single instruction! The code could have  been written as follows:  01: 8B 45 0C         mov   eax, [ebp+0Ch] 02: 83 61 1C 00      and   dword ptr [ecx+1Ch], 0 03: 89 41 0C         mov   [ecx+0Ch], eax 04: 8B 45 10         mov   eax, [ebp+10h] 05: C6 01 13         mov   byte ptr [ecx],13h 06: C6 41 01 01      mov   byte ptr [ecx+1],1 07: 66 C7 41 02 00+  mov   word ptr [ecx+2],0 08: 89 41 10         mov   [ecx+10h], eax  The compiler decided to fold three instructions into one because it knew  the constants ahead of time and wants to save space. The three-instruction  version occupies 13 bytes  the extra byte in line 7 is not shown , whereas the  one-instruction version occupies 6 bytes. Another interesting observation is  that memory access can be done at three granularity levels: byte  line 5–6 ,  word  line 6 , and double-word  line 1–4, 8 . The default granularity is 4 bytes,  which can be changed to 1 or 2 bytes with an override prefi x. In the example,  the override prefi x bytes are C6 and 66  italicized . Other prefi xes are discussed  as they come up.  The next memory access form is commonly used to access array-type objects.  Generally, the format is as follows: [Base + Index * scale]. This is best understood  through examples:  01: 8B 34 B5 40 05+  mov   esi, _KdLogBuffer[esi*4] ; always written as  mov   esi, [_KdLogBuffer + esi * 4] ; _KdLogBuffer is the base address of a global array and ; ESI is the index; we know that each element in the array ; is 4 bytes in length  hence the scaling factor   c01.indd  03:58:11:PM  01 16 2014  Page 7   8   Chapter 1   x86 and x64  02: 89 04 F7         mov   [edi+esi*8], eax ; here is EDI is the array base address; ESI is the array ; index; element size is 8.  In practice, this is observed in code looping over an array. For example:  01:                loop_start: 02: 8B 47 04         mov   eax, [edi+4] 03: 8B 04 98         mov   eax, [eax+ebx*4] 04: 85 C0            test  eax, eax ... 05: 74 14            jz    short loc_7F627F 06:                loc_7F627F: 07: 43               inc   ebx 08: 3B 1F            cmp   ebx, [edi] 09: 7C DD            jl    short loop_start  Line 2 reads a double-word from offset +4 from EDI and then uses it as the  base address into an array in line 3; hence, you know that EDI is likely a struc- ture that has an array at +4. Line 7 increments the index. Line 8 compares the  index against a value at offset +0 in the same structure. Given this info, this  small loop can be decompiled as follows:  typedef struct _FOO {     DWORD size;           +0x00     DWORD array[...];     +0x04 } FOO, *PFOO;  PFOO bar = ...; for  i = ...; i  size; i++  {     if  bar->array[i] != 0  {     ...     } }  The MOVSB MOVSW MOVSD instructions move data with 1-, 2-, or 4-byte granu- larity between two memory addresses. They implicitly use EDI ESI as the  destination source address, respectively. In addition, they also automatically  update the source destination address depending on the direction fl ag  DF  fl ag  in EFLAGS. If DF is 0, the addresses are decremented; otherwise, they are incre- mented. These instructions are typically used to implement string or memory  copy functions when the length is known at compile time. In some cases, they  are accompanied by the REP prefi x, which repeats an instruction up to ECX times.  Consider the following example:  c01.indd  03:58:11:PM  01 16 2014  Page 8      Assembly  Chapter 1   x86 and x64   9  01: BE 28 B5 41 00   mov   esi, offset _RamdiskBootDiskGuid ; ESI = pointer to RamdiskBootDiskGuid 02: 8D BD 40 FF FF+  lea   edi, [ebp-0C0h] ; EDI is an address somewhere on the stack 03: A5               movsd ; copies 4 bytes from EDI to ESI; increment each by 4 04: A5               movsd ; same as above 05: A5               movsd ; save as above 06: A5               movsd ; same as above  Pseudo C    * a GUID is 16-byte structure *  GUID RamDiskBootDiskGuid = ...;    global ... GUID foo; memcpy &foo, &RamdiskBootDiskGuid, sizeof GUID  ;  Line 2 deserves some special attention. Although the LEA instruction uses  [], it actually does not read from a memory address; it simply evaluates the  expression in square brackets and puts the result in the destination register.  For example, if EBP were 0x1000, then EDI would be 0xF40  =0x1000 – 0xC0   after executing line 2. The point is that LEA does not access memory, despite  the misleading syntax.  The following example, from nt!KiInitSystem, uses the REP prefi x:  01: 6A 08            push   8    ; push 8 on the stack  will explain stacks                                  ; later  02: ... 03: 59               pop    ecx  ; pop the stack. Basically sets ECX to 8. 04: ... 05: BE 00 44 61 00   mov    esi, offset _KeServiceDescriptorTable 06: BF C0 43 61 00   mov    edi, offset _KeServiceDescriptorTableShadow 07: F3 A5            rep movsd   ; copy 32 bytes  movsd repeated 8 times  ; from this we can deduce that whatever these two objects are, they are ;  likely to be 32 bytes in size.  The rough C equivalent of this would be as follows:  memcpy &KeServiceDescriptorTableShadow, &KeServiceDescriptorTable, 32 ;  c01.indd  03:58:11:PM  01 16 2014  Page 9   10   Chapter 1   x86 and x64  The fi nal example, nt!MmInitializeProcessAddressSpace, uses a combina-  tion of these instructions because the copy size is not a multiple of 4:  01: 8D B0 70 01 00+  lea   esi, [eax+170h] ; EAX is likely the base address of a structure. Remember what we said  ; about LEA ... 02: 8D BB 70 01 00+  lea   edi, [ebx+170h] ; EBX is likely to be base address of another structure of the same type 03: A5               movsd 04: A5               movsd 05: A5               movsd 06: 66 A5            movsw 07: A4               movsb  After lines 1–2, you know that EAX and EBX are likely to be of the same type  because they are being used as source destination and the offset is identical.  This code snippet simply copies 15 bytes from one structure fi eld to another.  Note that the code could also have been written using the MOVSB instruction  with a REP prefi x and ECX set to 15; however, that would be ineffi cient because  it results in 15 reads instead of only fi ve.  Another class of data movement instructions with implicit source and destina- tion includes the SCAS and STOS instructions. Similar to MOVS, these instructions  can operate at 1-, 2-, or 4-byte granularity. SCAS implicitly compares AL AX EAX  with data starting at the memory address EDI; EDI is automatically incremented  decremented depending on the DF bit in EFLAGS. Given its semantic, SCAS is com- monly used along with the REP prefi x to fi nd a byte, word, or double-word in  a buffer. For example, the C strlen   function can be implemented as follows:  01: 30 C0            xor    al, al ; set AL to 0  NUL byte .  You will frequently observe the XOR reg, reg ;  pattern in code. 02: 89 FB            mov    ebx, edi ; save the original pointer to the string 03: F2 AE            repne  scasb ; repeatedly scan forward one byte at a time as long as AL does not match the ; byte at EDI when this instruction ends, it means we reached the NUL byte in ; the string buffer 04: 29 DF            sub    edi, ebx ; edi is now the NUL byte location. Subtract that from the original pointer ; to the length.  STOS is the same as SCAS except that it writes the value AL AX EAX to EDI. It  is commonly used to initialize a buffer to a constant value  such as memset   .  Here is an example:  01: 33 C0            xor    eax, eax ; set EAX to 0 02: 6A 09            push   9 ; push 9 on the stack 03: 59               pop    ecx ; pop it back in ECX. Now ECX = 9.  c01.indd  03:58:11:PM  01 16 2014  Page 10      Chapter 1   x86 and x64   11  04: 8B FE            mov    edi, esi ; set the destination address 05: F3 AB            rep stosd ; write 36 bytes of zero to the destination buffer  STOSD repeated 9 times  ; this is equivalent lent to memset edi, 0, 36   LODS is another instruction from the same family. It reads a 1-, 2-, or 4-byte   value from ESI and stores it in AL, AX, or EAX.  Exercise    1.  This function uses a combination SCAS and STOS to do its work. First, explain  what is the type of the [EBP+8] and [EBP+C] in line 1 and 8, respectively.  Next, explain what this snippet does.  01: 8B 7D 08         mov   edi, [ebp+8] 02: 8B D7            mov   edx, edi 03: 33 C0            xor   eax, eax 04: 83 C9 FF         or    ecx, 0FFFFFFFFh 05: F2 AE            repne scasb 06: 83 C1 02         add   ecx, 2 07: F7 D9            neg   ecx 08: 8A 45 0C         mov   al, [ebp+0Ch] 09: 8B FA            mov   edi, edx 10: F3 AA            rep stosb 11: 8B C2            mov   eax, edx  Arithmetic Operations Fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication,  and division are natively supported by the instruction set. Bit-level operations  such as AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and left and right shift also have native corresponding  instructions. With the exception of multiplication and division, the remain- ing instructions are straightforward in terms of usage. These operations are  explained with the following examples:  01: 83 C4 14         add   esp, 14h          ; esp = esp + 0x14 02: 2B C8            sub   ecx, eax          ; ecx = ecx - eax  03: 83 EC 0C         sub   esp, 0Ch          ; esp = esp - 0xC 04: 41               inc   ecx               ; ecx = ecx + 1 05: 4F               dec   edi               ; edi = edi - 1 06: 83 C8 FF         or    eax, 0FFFFFFFFh   ; eax = eax  0xFFFFFFFF 07: 83 E1 07         and   ecx, 7            ; ecx = ecx & 7 08: 33 C0            xor   eax, eax          ; eax = eax ^ eax 09: F7 D7            not   edi               ; edi = ~edi 10: C0 E1 04         shl   cl, 4             ; cl = cl << 4 11: D1 E9            shr   ecx, 1            ; ecx = ecx >> 1 12: C0 C0 03         rol   al, 3             ; rotate AL left 3 positions 13: D0 C8            ror   al, 1             ; rotate AL right 1 position  c01.indd  03:58:11:PM  01 16 2014  Page 11   12   Chapter 1   x86 and x64  The left and right shift instructions  lines 11–12  merit some explanation, as  they are frequently observed in real-life code. These instructions are typically  used to optimize multiplication and division operations where the multiplicand  and divisor are a power of two. This type of optimization is sometimes known  as strength reduction because it replaces a computationally expensive operation  with a cheaper one. For example, integer division is relatively a slow operation,  but when the divisor is a power of two, it can be reduced to shifting bits to the  right; 100 2 is the same as 100>>1. Similarly, multiplication by a power of two  can be reduced to shifting bits to the left; 100*2 is the same as 100<<1.  Unsigned and signed multiplication is done through the MUL and IMUL instruc- tions, respectively. The MUL instruction has the following general form: MUL reg  memory. That is, it can only operate on register or memory values. The register  is multiplied with AL, AX, or EAX and the result is stored in AX, DX:AX, or EDX:EAX,  depending on the operand width. For example:  01: F7 E1          mul   ecx                ; EDX:EAX = EAX * ECX 02: F7 66 04       mul   dword ptr [esi+4]  ; EDX:EAX = EAX * dword_at ESI+4  03: F6 E1          mul   cl                 ; AX = AL * CL 04: 66 F7 E2       mul   dx                 ; DX:AX = AX * DX  Consider a few other concrete examples:  01: B8 03 00 00 00   mov   eax,3          ; set EAX=3 02: B9 22 22 22 22   mov   ecx,22222222h  ; set ECX=0x22222222 03: F7 E1            mul   ecx            ; EDX:EAX = 3 * 0x22222222 =                                            ; 0x66666666                                           ; hence, EDX=0, EAX=0x66666666 04: B8 03 00 00 00   mov   eax,3          ; set EAX=3 05: B9 00 00 00 80   mov   ecx,80000000h  ; set ECX=0x80000000 06: F7 E1            mul   ecx            ; EDX:EAX = 3 * 0x80000000 =                                            ; 0x180000000                                           ; hence, EDX=1, EAX=0x80000000  The reason why the result is stored in EDX:EAX for 32-bit multiplication is  because the result potentially may not fi t in one 32-bit register  as demonstrated  in lines 4–6 .  IMUL has three forms:    IMUL reg mem — Same as MUL    IMUL reg1, reg2 mem — reg1 = reg1 * reg2 mem    IMUL reg1, reg2 mem, imm — reg1 = reg2 * imm  Some disassemblers shorten the parameters. For example:  01: F7 E9            imul  ecx        ; EDX:EAX = EAX * ECX 02: 69 F6 A0 01 00+  imul  esi, 1A0h  ; ESI = ESI * 0x1A0  c01.indd  03:58:11:PM  01 16 2014  Page 12      Chapter 1   x86 and x64   13  03: 0F AF CE         imul  ecx, esi   ; ECX = ECX * ESI  Unsigned and signed division is done through the DIV and IDIV instructions,  respectively. They take only one parameter  divisor  and have the following  form: DIV IDIV reg mem. Depending on the divisor’s size, DIV will use either  AX, DX:AX, or EDX:EAX as the dividend, and the resulting quotient remainder  pair are stored in AL AH, AX DX, or EAX EDX. For example:  01: F7 F1            div   ecx     ; EDX:EAX   ECX, quotient in EAX,  02: F6 F1            div   cl      ; AX   CL, quotient in AL, remainder in AH 03: F7 76 24         div   dword ptr [esi+24h] ; see line 1  04: B1 02            mov   cl,2    ; set CL = 2 05: B8 0A 00 00 00   mov   eax,0Ah ; set EAX = 0xA 06: F6 F1            div   cl      ; AX CL = A 2 = 5 in AL  quotient ,                                     ; AH = 0  remainder  07: B1 02            mov   cl,2    ; set CL = 2 08: B8 09 00 00 00   mov   eax,09h ; set EAX = 0x9 09: F6 F1            div   cl      ; AX CL = 9 2 = 4 in AL  quotient ,                                     ; AH = 1  remainder   Stack Operations and Function Invocation The stack is a fundamental data structure in programming languages and operat- ing systems. For example, local variables in C are stored on the functions’ stack  space. When the operating system transitions from ring 3 to ring 0, it saves state  information on the stack. Conceptually, a stack is a last-in fi rst-out data structure  supporting two operations: push and pop. Push means to put something on top  of the stack; pop means to remove an item from the top. Concretely speaking,  on x86, a stack is a contiguous memory region pointed to by ESP and it grows  downwards. Push pop operations are done through the PUSH POP instruc- tions and they implicitly modify ESP. The PUSH instruction decrements ESP  and then writes data at the location pointed to by ESP; POP reads the data and  increments ESP. The default auto-increment decrement value is 4, but it can be  changed to 1 or 2 with a prefi x override. In practice, the value is almost always  4 because the OS requires the stack to be double-word aligned.  Suppose that ESP initially points to 0xb20000 and you have the following code:  ; initial ESP = 0xb20000 01: B8 AA AA AA AA  mov    eax,0AAAAAAAAh 02: BB BB BB BB BB  mov    ebx,0BBBBBBBBh 03: B9 CC CC CC CC  mov    ecx,0CCCCCCCCh 04: BA DD DD DD DD  mov    edx,0DDDDDDDDh 05: 50              push   eax ; address 0xb1fffc will contain the value 0xAAAAAAAA and ESP  ; will be 0xb1fffc  =0xb20000-4   c01.indd  03:58:11:PM  01 16 2014  Page 13   14   Chapter 1   x86 and x64  06: 53              push   ebx ; address 0xb1fff8 will contain the value 0xBBBBBBBB and ESP  ; will be 0xb1fff8  =0xb1fffc-4  07: 5E              pop    esi ; ESI will contain the value 0xBBBBBBBB and ESP will be 0xb1fffc ;  =0xb1fff8+4  08: 5F              pop    edi ; EDI will contain the value 0xAAAAAAAA and ESP will be 0xb20000 ;  =0xb1fffc+4   Figure 1-3 illustrates the stack layout.  ESP  0xb20000  … …  ESP  0xb1fffc 0xb20000  AAAAAAAA  … …  push eax  push ebx  ESP  0xb1fff8 0xb1fffc 0xb20000  pop esi  BBBBBBBB AAAAAAAA  … …  ESP  0xb20000  ESP  … … …  0xb1fffc 0xb20000  pop edi  AAAAAAAA  … …  Figure 1-3  ESP can also be directly modifi ed by other instructions, such as ADD and SUB. While high-level programming languages have the concept of functions that  can be called and returned from, the processor does not provide such abstrac- tion. At the lowest level, the processor operates only on concrete objects, such  as registers or data coming from memory. How are functions translated at the  machine level? They are implemented through the stack data structure! Consider  the following function: C  int __cdecl addme short a, short b  {     return a+b; }  Assembly  01: 004113A0 55           push   ebp  c01.indd  03:58:11:PM  01 16 2014  Page 14   Chapter 1   x86 and x64   15     C  02: 004113A1 8B EC        mov    ebp, esp 03: ... 04: 004113BE 0F BF 45 08  movsx  eax, word ptr [ebp+8] 05: 004113C2 0F BF 4D 0C  movsx  ecx, word ptr [ebp+0Ch] 06: 004113C6 03 C1        add   eax, ecx 07: ... 08: 004113CB 8B E5        mov    esp, ebp 09: 004113CD 5D           pop    ebp 10: 004113CE C3           retn  The function is invoked with the following code:  sum = addme x, y ;  Assembly  01: 004129F3 50               push  eax    02: ... 03: 004129F8 51               push  ecx    04: 004129F9 E8 F1 E7 FF FF   call  addme  05: 004129FE 83 C4 08         add   esp, 8  Before going into the details, fi rst consider the CALL RET instructions and   calling conventions. The CALL instruction performs two operations:   1.  It pushes the return address  address immediately after the CALL instruc-  tion  on the stack.    2.  It changes EIP to the call destination. This effectively transfers control to   the call target and begins execution there.  RET simply pops the address stored on the top of the stack into EIP and trans- fers control to it  literally like a “POP EIP” but such instruction sequence does  not exist on x86 . For example, if you want to begin execution at 0x12345678,  you can just do the following:  01: 68 78 56 34 12   push  0x12345678 02: C3               ret  A calling convention is a set of rules dictating how function calls work at the  machine level. It is defi ned by the Application Binary Interface  ABI  for a par- ticular system. For example, should the parameters be passed through the stack,  in registers, or both? Should the parameters be passed in from left-to-right or  right-to-left? Should the return value be stored on the stack, in registers, or both?  There are many calling conventions, but the popular ones are CDECL, STDCALL,  THISCALL, and FASTCALL.  The compiler can also generate its own custom call- ing convention, but those will not be discussed here.  Table 1-2 summarizes  their semantic.  c01.indd  03:58:11:PM  01 16 2014  Page 15   16   Chapter 1   x86 and x64  Table 1-2: Calling Conventions  CDECL  STDCALL  FASTCALL  Parameters  Pushed on the  stack from right- to-left. Caller must  clean up the stack  after the call.  Same as CDECL  except that the  callee must clean  the stack.  First two parameters are  passed in ECX and EDX. The  rest are on the stack.  Return value  Stored in EAX.  Stored in EAX.  Stored in EAX.  Non-volatile  registers  EBP, ESP, EBX,  ESI, EDI.  EBP, ESP, EBX,  ESI, EDI.  EBP, ESP, EBX, ESI, EDI.  We now return to the code snippet to discuss how the function addme is  invoked. In line 1 and 3, the two parameters are pushed on the stack; ECX and  EAX are the fi rst and second parameter, respectively. Line 4 invokes the addme  function with the CALL instruction. This immediately pushes the return address,  0x4129FE, on the stack and begins execution at 0x4113A0. Figure 1-4 illustrates  the stack layout after line 4 is executed.  ESP  004129FE  ECX EAX … …  Figure 1-4  After line 4 executes, we are now in the addme function body. Line 1 pushes  EBP on the stack. Line 2 sets EBP to the current stack pointer. This two-instruction  sequence is typically known as the function prologue because it establishes a new  function frame. Line 4 reads the value at address EBP+8, which is the fi rst param- eter on the stack; line 5 reads the second parameter. Note that the parameters  are accessed using EBP as the base register. When used in this context, EBP is  known as the base frame pointer  see line 2  because it points to the stack frame  for the current function, and parameters locals can be accessed relative to it.  The compiler can also be instructed to generate code that does not use EBP as  the base frame pointer through an optimization called frame pointer omission.  With such optimization, access to local variables and parameters is done rela- tive to ESP, and EBP can be used as a general register like EAX, EBX, ECX, and so  on. Line 6 adds the numbers and saves the result in EAX. Line 8 sets the stack  pointer to the base frame pointer. Line 9 pops the saved EBP from line 1 into   c01.indd  03:58:11:PM  01 16 2014  Page 16      Chapter 1   x86 and x64   17  EBP. This two-instruction sequence is commonly referred to as the function epi- logue because it is at the end of the function and restores the previous function  frame. At this point, the top of the stack contains the return address saved by  the CALL instruction at 0x4129F9. Line 10 performs a RET, which pops the stack  and resumes execution at 0x4129FE. Line 5 in the snippet shrinks the stack by  8 because the caller must clean up the stack per CDECL's calling convention.  If the function addme had local variables, the code would need to grow the  stack by subtracting ESP after line 2. All local variables would then be accessible  through a negative offset from EBP.  Exercises    1.  Given what you learned about CALL and RET, explain how you would read   the value of EIP? Why can’t you just do MOV EAX, EIP?    2.  Come up with at least two code sequences to set EIP to 0xAABBCCDD.   3.  In the example function, addme, what would happen if the stack pointer   were not properly restored before executing RET?    4.  In all of the calling conventions explained, the return value is stored in a  32-bit register  EAX . What happens when the return value does not fi t in a  32-bit register? Write a program to experiment and evaluate your answer.  Does the mechanism change from compiler to compiler?  Control Flow This section describes how the system implements conditional execution for  higher-level constructs like if else, switch case, and while for. All of these are  implemented through the CMP, TEST, JMP, and Jcc instructions and EFLAGS reg- ister. The following list summarizes the common fl ags in EFLAGS:     ZF Zero fl ag—Set if the result of the previous arithmetic operation is zero.    SF Sign fl ag—Set to the most signifi cant bit of the result.    CF Carry fl ag—Set when the result requires a carry. It applies to unsigned      OF Overfl ow fl ag—Set if the result overfl ows the max size. It applies to   numbers.  signed numbers.  Arithmetic instructions update these fl ags based on the result. For example,  the instruction SUB EAX, EAX would cause ZF to be set. The Jcc instructions,  where “cc” is a conditional code, changes control fl ow depending on these   c01.indd  03:58:11:PM  01 16 2014  Page 17   18   Chapter 1   x86 and x64  fl ags. There can be up to 16 conditional codes, but the most common ones are  described in Table 1-3.  Table 1-3: Common Conditional Codes  CONDITIONAL  CODE  ENGLISH DESCRIPTION  MACHINE  DESCRIPTION  B NAE  NB AE  E Z  NE NZ  L  GE NL  G NLE  If-Else  Below Neither Above nor Equal.

SF ^ OF   ZF  = 0  Because assembly language does not have a defi ned type system, one of the  few ways to recognize signed unsigned types is through these conditional codes. The CMP instruction compares two operands and sets the appropriate condi- tional code in EFLAGS; it compares two numbers by subtracting one from another  without updating the result. The TEST instruction does the same thing except  it performs a logical AND between the two operands.  If-else constructs are quite simple to recognize because they involve a compare  test followed by a Jcc. For example: Assembly  01:   mov   esi, [ebp+8] 02:   mov   edx, [esi] 03:   test  edx, edx 04:   jz    short loc_4E31F9 05:   mov   ecx, offset _FsRtlFastMutexLookasideList 06:   call  _ExFreeToNPagedLookasideList@8 07:   and   dword ptr [esi], 0 08:   lea   eax, [esi+4] 09:   push  eax 10:   call  _FsRtlUninitializeBaseMcb@4 11: loc_4E31F9:  c01.indd  03:58:11:PM  01 16 2014  Page 18      Chapter 1   x86 and x64   19  12:   pop   esi 13:   pop   ebp 14:   retn  4 15: _FsRtlUninitializeLargeMcb@4 endp  Pseudo C  if  *esi == 0  {   return; } ExFreeToNPagedLookasideList ... ; *esi = 0; ... return;  OR  if  *esi != 0  {   ...   ExFreeToNPagedLookasideList ... ;   *esi = 0;   ... } return;  Line 2 reads a value at location ESI and stores it in EDX. Line 3 ANDs EDX with  itself and sets the appropriate fl ags in EFLAGS. Note that this pattern is commonly  used to determine whether a register is zero. Line 4 jumps to loc_4E31F9  line 12   if ZF=1. If ZF=0, then it executes line 5 and continues until the function returns. Note that there are two slightly different but logically equivalent C transla-  A switch-case block is a sequence of if else statements. For example: Switch-Case  tions for this snippet.  Switch-Case  switch ch  {     case 'c':         handle_C  ;         break;     case 'h':         handle_H  ;         break;     default:         break; } domore  ; ...  c01.indd  03:58:11:PM  01 16 2014  Page 19   Hence, the machine code translation will be a series if else. The following   simple example illustrates the idea: Assembly  20   Chapter 1   x86 and x64  If-Else  if  ch == 'c'  {     handle_C  ; } else if  ch == 'h'  {     handle_H  ; } domore  ; ...  01:   push   ebp 02:   mov    ebp, esp 03:   mov    eax, [ebp+8] 04:   sub    eax, 41h 05:   jz     short loc_caseA 06:   dec    eax 07:   jz     short loc_caseB 08:   dec    eax 09:   jz     short loc_caseC 10:   mov    al, 5Ah 11:   movzx  eax, al 12:   pop    ebp 13:   retn 14: loc_caseC:  15:   mov    al, 43h 16:   movzx  eax, al 17:   pop    ebp 18:   retn 19: loc_caseB:  20:   mov    al, 42h 21:   movzx  eax, al 22:   pop    ebp 23:   retn 24: loc_caseA: 25:   mov    al, 41h 26:   movzx  eax, al 27:   pop    ebp 28:   retn  C  unsigned char switchme int a  {     unsigned char res;  c01.indd  03:58:11:PM  01 16 2014  Page 20      Chapter 1   x86 and x64   21  Real-life switch-case statements can be more complex, and compilers commonly  build a jump table to reduce the number of comparisons and conditional jumps.  The jump table is essentially an array of addresses, each pointing to the handler  for a specifi c case. This pattern can be observed in Sample J in sub_10001110: Assembly      switch a  {     case 0x41:         res = 'A';         break;     case 0x42:         res = 'B';         break;     case 0x43:         res = 'C';         break;     default:         res = 'Z';         break;     }     return res; }  01:   cmp     edi, 5 02:   ja      short loc_10001141     03:   jmp     ds:off_100011A4[edi*4] 04: loc_10001125:                    05:   mov     esi, 40h               06:   jmp     short loc_10001145 07: loc_1000112C:                    08:   mov     esi, 20h               09:   jmp     short loc_10001145 10: loc_10001133:                    11:   mov     esi, 38h               12:   jmp     short loc_10001145 13: loc_1000113A:                    14:   mov     esi, 30h               15:   jmp     short loc_10001145 16: loc_10001141:                    17:   mov     esi, [esp+0Ch]     18: ... 19: off_100011A4 dd offset loc_10001125 20:   dd offset loc_10001125            21:   dd offset loc_1000113A 22:   dd offset loc_1000112C 23:   dd offset loc_10001133 24:   dd offset loc_1000113A  c01.indd  03:58:11:PM  01 16 2014  Page 21   22   Chapter 1   x86 and x64  Pseudo C  switch edi  {   case 0:   case 1:        goto loc_10001125;     esi = 0x40;     break;   case 2:   case 5:        goto loc_1000113A;     esi = 0x30;     break;   case 3:        goto loc_1000112C;     esi = 0x20;     break;   case 4:        goto loc_10001133;     esi = 0x38;     break;   default:        goto loc_10001141;     esi = * esp+0xC      break; } ...  Here, the compiler knows that there are only fi ve cases and the case value  is consecutive; hence, it can construct the jump table and index into it directly   line 3 . Without the jump table, there would be 10 additional instructions to  test each case and branch to the handler.  There are other forms of switch case  optimizations, but we will not cover them here.   Loops  At the machine level, loops are implemented using a combination of Jcc and  JMP instructions. In other words, they are implemented using if else and goto  constructs. The best way to understand this is to rewrite a loop using only if  else and goto. Consider the following example: Using for  for  int i=0; i<10; i++  {     printf "%d\n", i ; } printf "done!\n" ;  c01.indd  03:58:11:PM  01 16 2014  Page 22      Chapter 1   x86 and x64   23  Using if else and goto  int i = 0; loop_start:     if  i < 10  {         printf "%d\n", i ;         i++;         goto loop_start;     } printf "done!n" ;  When compiled, both versions are identical at the machine-code level:  01: 00401002   mov    edi, ds:__imp__printf 02: 00401008   xor    esi, esi 03: 0040100A   lea    ebx, [ebx+0] 04: 00401010 loc_401010:            05: 00401010   push   esi 06: 00401011   push   offset Format                 ; "%d\n" 07: 00401016   call   edi ; __imp__printf 08: 00401018   inc    esi 09: 00401019   add    esp, 8 10: 0040101C   cmp    esi, 0Ah 11: 0040101F   jl     short loc_401010 12: 00401021   push   offset aDone                  ; "done!\n" 13: 00401026   call   edi ; __imp__printf 14: 00401028   add    esp, 4  Line 1 sets EDI to the printf function. Line 2 sets ESI to 0. Line 4 begins  the loop; however, note that it does not begin with a comparison. There is no  comparison here because the compiler knows that the counter was initialized  to 0  see line 2  and is obviously going to be less than 10 so it skips the check.  Lines 5–7 call the printf function with the right parameters  format specifi er  and our number . Line 8 increments the number. Line 9 cleans up the stack  because printf uses the CDECL calling convention. Line 10 checks to see if the  counter is less than 0xA. If it is, it jumps back to loc_401010. If the counter is  not less than 0xA, it continues execution at line 12 and fi nishes with a printf. One important observation to make is that the disassembly allowed us to  infer that the counter is a signed integer. Line 11 uses the “less than” conditional  code  JL , so we immediately know that the comparison was done on signed  integers. Remember: If “above below,” it is unsigned; if “less than greater than,”  it is signed. Sample L has a small function, sub_1000AE3B, with the following  interesting loop: Assembly  01: sub_1000AE3B proc near 02:   push    edi  c01.indd  03:58:11:PM  01 16 2014  Page 23   24   Chapter 1   x86 and x64  03:   push    esi 04:   call    ds:lstrlenA 05:   mov     edi, eax 06:   xor     ecx, ecx 07:   xor     edx, edx 08:   test    edi, edi 09:   jle     short loc_1000AE5B 10: loc_1000AE4D: 11:   mov     al, [edx+esi] 12:   mov     [ecx+esi], al 13:   add     edx, 3 14:   inc     ecx 15:   cmp     edx, edi 16:   jl      short loc_1000AE4D 17: loc_1000AE5B: 18:   mov     byte ptr [ecx+esi], 0 19:   mov     eax, esi 20:   pop     edi 21:   retn 22: sub_1000AE3B endp  C  char *sub_1000AE3B  char *str  {   int len, i=0, j=0;   len = lstrlenA str ;   if  len <= 0  {     str[j] = 0;     return str;   }   while  j < len  {     str[i] = str[j];     j = j+3;     i = i+1;   }   str[i] = 0;   return str; }  The sub_1000AE3B function has one parameter passed using a custom calling  convention  ESI holds the parameter . Line 2 saves EDI. Line 3 calls lstrlenA  with the parameter; hence, you immediately know that ESI is of type char *.  Line 5 saves the return value  string length  in EDI. Lines 6–7 clear ECX and  EDX. Lines 8–9 check to see if the string length is less than or equal to zero. If it  is, control is transferred to line 18, which sets the value at ECX+ESI to 0. If it is  not, then execution is continued at line 11, which is the start of a loop. First, it  reads the character at ESI+EDX  line 11 , and then it stores it at ESI+ECX  line 12 .   c01.indd  03:58:11:PM  01 16 2014  Page 24      Chapter 1   x86 and x64   25  Next, it increments the EDX and ECX by three and one, respectively. Lines 15–16  check to see if EDX is less than the string length; if so, execution goes back to  the loop start. If not, execution is continued at line 18.  It may seem convoluted at fi rst, but this function takes an obfuscated string  whose deobfuscated value is every third character. For example, the string SX] OTYFKPTY^W\\aAFKRW\\E is actually SOFTWARE. The purpose of this function  is to prevent naïve string scanners and evade detection. As an exercise, you  should decompile this function so that it looks more “natural”  as opposed to  our literal translation .  Outside of the normal Jcc constructs, certain loops can be implemented using  the LOOP instruction. The LOOP instruction executes a block of code up to ECX  time. For example: Assembly  01: 8B CA         mov    ecx, edx 02:             loc_CFB8F: 03: AD            lodsd 04: F7 D0         not    eax 05: AB            stosd 06: E2 FA         loop   loc_CFB8F  Rough C  while  ecx != 0  {     eax = *edi;     edi++;     *esi = ~eax;     esi++;     ecx--; }  Line 1 reads the counter from EDX. Line 3 is the loop start; it reads in a double- word at the memory address EDI and saves that in EAX; it also increments EDI  by 4. Line 4 performs the NOT operator on the value just read. Line 5 writes the  modifi ed value to the memory address ESI and increments ESI by 4. Line 6  checks to see if ECX is 0; if not, execution is continued at the loop start.  System Mechanism  The previous sections explain mechanisms and instructions that are available to  code running at all privilege levels. To get a better appreciation of the architec- ture, this section discusses two fundamental system-level mechanisms: virtual  address translation and exception interrupt handling. You may skip this section on  a fi rst read.  c01.indd  03:58:11:PM  01 16 2014  Page 25   26   Chapter 1   x86 and x64  Address Translation The physical memory on a computer system is divided into 4KB units called  pages.  A page can be more than 4KB, but we will not discuss the other sizes  here.  Memory addresses are divided into two categories: virtual and physical.  Virtual addresses are those used by instructions executed in the processor when  paging is enabled. For example:  01: A1 78 56 34 12  mov   eax, [0x12345678]; read memory at the virtual                                             ; address 0x12345678 01: 89 08           mov   [eax], ecx       ; write ECX at the virtual                                             ; address EAX  Physical addresses are the actual memory locations used by the processor  when accessing memory. The processor’s memory management unit  MMU   transparently translates every virtual address into a physical address before  accessing it. While a virtual address may seem like just another number to the  user, there is a structure to it when viewed by the MMU. On x86 systems with  physical address extension  PAE  support, a virtual memory address can be  divided into indices into three tables and offset: page directory pointer table   PDPT , page directory  PD , page table  PT , and page table entry  PTE . A PDPT  is an array of four 8-byte elements, each pointing to a PD. A PD is an array of  512 8-byte elements, each pointing to a PT. A PT is an array of 512 8-byte ele- ments each containing a PTE. For example, the virtual address 0xBF80EE6B can  be understood as shown in Figure 1-5.  0×BF80EE6B  10  0×2   00000 1110  0×E   10111111 10000000 11101110 01101011  111111 100  0×1FC  9 bits Index into PD  9 bits Index into PT  1110 01101011  0×E6B  12 bits Page offset  2 bits Index into PDPT Figure 1-5  The 8-byte elements in these tables contain data about the tables, memory  permission, and other memory characteristics. For example, there are bits that  determine whether the page is read-only or readable writable, executable or  non-executable, accessible by user or not, and so on.  The address translation process revolves around these three tables and the  CR3 register. CR3 holds the physical base address of the PDPT. The rest of this  section walks through the translation of the virtual address 0xBF80EE6B on a  real system  refer to Figure 1-5 :  kd> r @cr3           ; CR3 is the physical address for the base of a PDPT cr3=085c01e0 kd> !dq @cr3+2*8 L1  ; read the PDPT entry at index 2  85c01f0 00000000`0d66e001  c01.indd  03:58:11:PM  01 16 2014  Page 26      Chapter 1   x86 and x64   27  Per the documentation, the bottom 12 bits of a PDPT entry are fl ags reserved  bits, and the remaining ones are used as the physical address of the PD base.  Bit 63 is the NX fl ag in PAE, so you will also need to clear that as well. In this  particular example, we did not clear it because it is already 0.  We are looking  at code pages that are executable.   ; 0x00000000`0d66e001 = 00001101 01100110 11100000 00000001 ; after clearing the bottom 12 bits, we have ; 0x0d66e000          = 00001101 01100110 11100000 00000000 ; This tells us that the PD base is at physical address 0x0d66e000 kd> !dq 0d66e000+0x1fc*8 L1   ; read the PD entry at index 0x1FC  d66efe0 00000000`0964b063  Again, per the documentation, the bottom 12 bits of a PD entry are used for   fl ags reserved bits, and the remaining ones are used as the base for the PT:  ; 0x0964b063 = 00001001 01100100 10110000 01100011 ; after clearing the bottom 12 bits, we get ; 0x0964b000 = 00001001 01100100 10110000 00000000 ; This tells us that the PT base is at 0x0964b000 kd> !dq 0964b000+e*8 L1      ; read the PT entry at index 0xE  964b070 00000000`06694021  Again, the bottom 12 bits can be cleared to get to the base of a page entry:  ; 0x06694021 = 00000110 01101001 01000000 00100001 ; after clearing bottom 12 bits, we get ; 0x06694000 = 00000110 01101001 01000000 00000000 ; This tells us that the page entry base is at 0x06694000 kd> !db 06694000+e6b L8      ; read 8 bytes from the page entry at offset  0xE6B  6694e6b 8b ff 55 8b ec 83 ec 0c ..U.....[ .t....    ; our data at that                                                        ; physical page kd> db bf80ee6b L8           ; read 8 bytes from the virtual address bf80ee6b  8b ff 55 8b ec 83 ec ..U.....[ .t....       ; same data!  After the entire process, it is determined that the virtual address 0xBF80EE6B   translates to the physical address 0x6694E6B.  Modern operating systems implement process address space separation using  this mechanism. Every process is associated with a different CR3, resulting in  process-specifi c virtual address translation. It is the magic behind each pro- cess’s illusion that it has its own address space. Hopefully you will have more  appreciation for the processor the next time your program accesses memory!  Interrupts and Exceptions This section briefl y discusses interrupts and exceptions, as complete implemen- tation details can be found in Chapter 3, “The Windows Kernel.”  In contemporary computing systems, the processor is typically connected to  peripheral devices through a data bus such as PCI Express, FireWire, or USB.   c01.indd  03:58:11:PM  01 16 2014  Page 27   28   Chapter 1   x86 and x64  When a device requires the processor’s attention, it causes an interrupt that  forces the processor to pause whatever it is doing and handle the device’s request.  How does the processor know how to handle the request? At the highest level,  one can think of an interrupt as being associated with a number that is then  used to index into an array of function pointers. When the processor receives  the interrupt, it executes the function at the index associated with the interrupt  and resumes execution at wherever it was before the interrupt occurred. These  are called hardware interrupts because they are generated by hardware devices.  They are asynchronous by nature.  When the processor is executing an instruction, it may run into exceptions.  For example, an instruction could generate a divide-by-zero error, reference an  invalid address, or trigger a privilege level transition. For the purpose of this  discussion, exceptions can be classifi ed into two categories: faults and traps. A  fault is a correctable exception. For example, when the processor executes an  instruction that references a valid memory address but the data is not present  in main memory  it was paged out , a page fault exception is generated. The  processor handles this by saving the current execution state, calling the page  fault handler to correct this exception  by paging in the data , and re-executing  the same instruction  which should no longer cause a page fault . A trap is an  exception caused by executing special kinds of instructions. For example, the  instruction SYSENTER causes the processor to begin executing the generic system  call handler; after the handler is done, execution is resumed at the instruction  immediately after SYSENTER. Hence, the major difference between a fault and  a trap is where execution resumes. Operating systems commonly implement  system calls through the interrupt and exception mechanism.  Walk-Through  We fi nish the chapter with a walk-through of a function with fewer than 100  instructions. It is Sample J’s DllMain routine. This exercise has two objectives.  First, it applies almost every concept covered in the chapter  except for switch- case . Second, it teaches an important requirement in the practice of reverse  engineering: reading technical manuals and online documentation.

Line 5 reserves 0x130 bytes of stack space.  Line 6 saves EDI. Line 7 executes the SIDT instruction, which writes the 6-byte  IDT register to a specifi ed memory region. Line 8 reads a double-word at EBP-6  and saves it in EAX. Lines 9–10 check if EAX is below-or-equal to 0x8003F400. If it  is, execution is transferred to line 18; otherwise, it continues executing at line 11.  Lines 11–12 do a similar check except that the condition is not-below 0x80047400.  If it is, execution is transferred to line 18; otherwise, it continues executing at  line 13. Line 13 clears EAX. Line 14 restores the saved EDI register in line 6. Lines  15–16 restore the previous base frame and stack pointer. Line 17 adds 0xC bytes  to the stack pointer and then returns to the caller.  Before discussing the next area, note a few things about these fi rst 17 lines.  The SIDT instruction  line 7  writes the content of the IDT register to a 6-byte   c01.indd  03:58:11:PM  01 16 2014  Page 30      Chapter 1   x86 and x64   31  memory location. What is the IDT register? The Intel AMD reference manual  states that IDT is an array of 256 8-byte entries, each containing a pointer to an  interrupt handler, segment selector, and offset. When an interrupt or exception  occurs, the processor uses the interrupt number as an index into the IDT and  calls the entry’s specifi ed handler. The IDT register is a 6-byte register; the top  4 bytes contain the base of the IDT array table and the bottom 2 bytes store the  table limit. With this in mind, you now know that line 8 is actually reading the  IDT base address. Lines 9 and 11 check whether the base address is in the range   0x8003F400, 0x80047400 . What is special about these seemingly random con- stants? If you search the Internet, you will note that 0x8003F400 is an IDT base  address on Windows XP on x86. This can be verifi ed in the kernel debugger:  0: kd> vertarget Windows XP Kernel Version 2600  Service Pack 3  MP  2 procs  Free x86 compat- ible Built by: 2600.xpsp.080413-2111 … 0: kd> r @idtr idtr=8003f400 0: kd> ~1 1: kd> r @idtr idtr=bab3c590  Why does the code check for this behavior? One possible explanation is that the  developer assumed that an IDT base address falling in that range is considered  “invalid” or may be the result of being virtualized. The function automatically  returns zero if the IDTR is “invalid.” You can decompile this code to C as follows:  typedef struct _IDTR {     DWORD base;     SHORT limit; } IDTR, *PIDTR; BOOL __stdcall DllMain  HINSTANCE hinstDLL, DWORD fdwReason, LPVOID lpvRe- served  {     IDTR idtr;     __sidt &idtr ;     if  idtr.base > 0x8003F400 && idtr.base < 0x80047400h  { return FALSE; }       line 18     ...  }  If you read the manual closely, you’ll note that each processor has its own   N O T E  IDT and hence IDTR. Therefore, on a multi-core system, IDTR will be diﬀ erent for each  core. Clearly, 0x8003F400 is valid only for core 0 on Windows XP. If the instruction  were to be scheduled to run on another core, the IDTR would be 0xBAB3C590. On later  versions of Windows, the IDT base addresses change between reboots; hence, the  practice of hardcoding base addresses will not work.  c01.indd  03:58:11:PM  01 16 2014  Page 31   32   Chapter 1   x86 and x64  If the IDT base seems valid, the code continues execution at line 18. Lines  19–20 clear EAX and set ECX to 0x49. Line 21 uses sets EDI to whatever EBP-0x12C  is; since EBP is the base frame pointer, EBP-0x12C is the address of a local vari- able. Line 22 writes zero at the location pointed to by EBP-0x130. Lines 23–24  push EAX and 2 on the stack. Line 25 zeroes a 0x124-byte buffer starting from  EBP-0x12C. Line 26 calls CreateToolhelp32Snapshot:  HANDLE WINAPI CreateToolhelp32Snapshot    _In_  DWORD dwFlags,   _In_  DWORD th32ProcessID  ;  This Win32 API function takes two integer parameters. As a general rule,  Win32 API functions follow STDCALL calling convention. Hence, the dwFlags  and th32ProcessId parameters are 0x2  line 24  and 0x0  line 23 . This func- tion enumerates all processes on the system and returns a handle to be used in  Process32Next. Lines 27–28 save the return value in EDI and check if it is -1. If  it is, the return value is set to 0 and it returns  lines 30–34 ; otherwise, execution  continues at line 35. Line 36 sets EAX to the address of the local variable previ- ously initialized to 0 in line 22; line 40 initializes it to 0x128. Lines 37–39 push  ESI, EAX, and EDI on the stack. Line 41 calls Process32First: Function prototype  BOOL WINAPI Process32First    _In_     HANDLE hSnapshot,   _Inout_  LPPROCESSENTRY32 lppe  ;  Relevant structure deﬁ nition  typedef struct tagPROCESSENTRY32 {   DWORD     dwSize;   DWORD     cntUsage;   DWORD     th32ProcessID;   ULONG_PTR th32DefaultHeapID;   DWORD     th32ModuleID;   DWORD     cntThreads;   DWORD     th32ParentProcessID;   LONG      pcPriClassBase;   DWORD     dwFlags;   TCHAR     szExeFile[MAX_PATH]; } PROCESSENTRY32, *PPROCESSENTRY32;  00000000 PROCESSENTRY32 struc ;  sizeof=0x128  00000000 dwSize dd ? 00000004 cntUsage dd ? 00000008 th32ProcessID dd ?  c01.indd  03:58:11:PM  01 16 2014  Page 32      Chapter 1   x86 and x64   33  0000000C th32DefaultHeapID dd ? 00000010 th32ModuleID dd ? 00000014 cntThreads dd ? 00000018 th32ParentProcessID dd ? 0000001C pcPriClassBase dd ? 00000020 dwFlags dd ? 00000024 szExeFile db 260 dup ?  00000128 PROCESSENTRY32 ends  Because this API takes two parameters, hSnapshot is EDI  line 39, previously  the returned handle from CreateToolhelp32Snapshot in line 27 , and lppe is the  address of a local variable  EBP-0x130 . Because lppe points to a PROCESSENTRY32  structure, we immediately know that the local variable at EBP-0x130 is of the  same type. It also makes sense because the documentation for Process32First  states that before calling the function, the dwSize fi eld must be set to the size  of a PROCESSENTRY32 structure  which is 0x128 . We now know that lines 19–25  were simply initializing this structure to 0. In addition, we can say that this  local variable starts at EBP-0x130 and ends at EBP-0x8.  Line 42 tests the return value of Process32Next. If it is zero, execution begins at  line 70; otherwise, it continues at line 43. Line 44 saves the address of the stricmp  function in ESI. Line 45 sets ECX to the address of a local variable  EBP-0x10C ,  which happens to be a fi eld in PROCESSENTRY32  see the previous paragraph .  Lines 46–48 push 0x10007C50 ECX on the stack and call stricmp. We know  that stricmp takes two character strings as arguments; hence, ECX must be the  szExeFile fi eld in PROCESSENTRY32 and 0x10007C50 is the address of a string:  .data:10007C50 65 78 70 6C 6F+Str2 db 'explorer.exe',0  Line 49 cleans up the stack because stricmp uses CDECL calling convention.  Line 50 checks stricmp’s return value. If it is zero, meaning that the string  matched "explorer.exe", execution begins at line 66; otherwise, it continues  execution at line 52. We can now decompile lines 18–51 as follows:      HANDLE h;     PROCESSENTRY32 procentry;     h = CreateToolhelp32Snapshot TH32CS_SNAPPROCESS, 0 ;     if  h == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE  { return FALSE; }          memset &procentry, 0, sizeof PROCESSENTRY32  ;     procentry.dwSize = sizeof procentry ;    0x128     if  Process32Next h, &procentry  == FALSE  {            line 70         ...     }     if  stricmp procentry.szExeFile, "explorer.exe"  == 0  {            line 66         ...     }        line 52  c01.indd  03:58:11:PM  01 16 2014  Page 33   34   Chapter 1   x86 and x64  Lines 52–65 are nearly identical to the previous block except that they form  a loop with two exit conditions. The fi rst exit condition is when Process32Next  returns FALSE  line 58  and the second is when stricmp returns zero. We can  decompile lines 52–65 as follows:      while  Process32Next h, &procentry  != FALSE  {         if  stricmp procentry.szExeFile, "explorer".exe"  == 0              break;     }  After the loop exits, execution resumes at line 66. Lines 67–68 save the match- ing PROCESSENTRY32’s th32ParentProcessID th32ProcessID in EAX ECX and  continue execution at 37. Notice that Line 66 is also a jump target in line 43.  Lines 70–74 read the fdwReason parameter of DllMain  EBP+C  and check  whether it is 0  DLL_PROCESS_DETACH . If it is, the return value is set to 0 and  it returns; otherwise, it goes to line 82. Lines 82–85 check if the fdwReason is  greater than 1  i.e., DLL_THREAD_ATTACH, DLL_THREAD_DETACH . If it is, the return  value is set to 1 and it returns; otherwise, execution continues at line 86. Lines  86–92 call CreateThread:  HANDLE WINAPI CreateThread    _In_opt_   LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES lpThreadAttributes,   _In_       SIZE_T dwStackSize,   _In_       LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE lpStartAddress,   _In_opt_   LPVOID lpParameter,   _In_       DWORD dwCreationFlags,   _Out_opt_  LPDWORD lpThreadId  ;  with lpStartAddress as 0x100032D0. This block can be decompiled as follows:  if  fdwReason == DLL_PROCESS_DETACH  { return FALSE; } if  fdwReason == DLL_THREAD_ATTACH  fdwReason == DLL_THREAD_DETACH  {     return TRUE; } CreateThread 0, 0,  LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE  0x100032D0, 0, 0, 0 ; return TRUE;  Having analyzed the function, we can deduce that the developer’s original   intention was this:   1.  Detect whether the target machine has a “sane” IDT.   2.  Check whether “explorer.exe” is running on the system—i.e., someone   logged on.    3.  Create a main thread that infects the target machine.  c01.indd  03:58:11:PM  01 16 2014  Page 34      Exercises  Chapter 1   x86 and x64   35    1.  Repeat the walk-through by yourself.

Bruce’s favorite x86 x64 disassembly library is BeaEngine by BeatriX   www.beaengine.org . Experiment with it by writing a program to disas- semble a binary at its entry point.  x64  x64 is an extension of x86, so most of the architecture properties are the same,  with minor differences such as register size and some instructions are unavail- able  like PUSHAD . The following sections discuss the relevant differences.  Register Set and Data Types The register set has 18 64-bit GPRs, and can be illustrated as shown in  Figure 1-6. Note that 64-bit registers have the “R” prefi x.  63  0  63  RAX  31  EAX  AX  AH  AL  15  7  Figure 1-6  RBP  31  0  EBP  15  PL  BP  7  While RBP can still be used as the base frame pointer, it is rarely used for that  purpose in real-life compiler-generated code. Most x64 compilers simply treat  RBP as another GPR, and reference local variables relative to RSP.  Data Movement x64 supports a concept referred to as RIP-relative addressing, which allows instruc- tions to reference data at a relative position to RIP. For example:  01: 0000000000000000 48 8B 05 00 00+  mov     rax, qword ptr cs:loc_A 02:                                   ; originally written as "mov rax,  [rip]" 03: 0000000000000007                loc_A:  c01.indd  03:58:11:PM  01 16 2014  Page 36      Chapter 1   x86 and x64   37  04: 0000000000000007 48 31 C0         xor     rax, rax 05: 000000000000000A 90               nop  Line 1 reads the address of loc_A  which is 0x7  and saves it in RAX. RIP-  relative addressing is primarily used to facilitate position-independent code.  Most arithmetic instructions are automatically promoted to 64 bits even   though the operands are only 32 bits. For example:  48 B8 88 77 66+ mov   rax, 1122334455667788h 31 C0           xor   eax, eax  ; will also clear the upper 32bits of RAX.                                 ; i.e., RAX=0 after this 48 C7 C0 FF FF+ mov   rax,0FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFh FF C0           inc   eax  ; RAX=0 after this  Canonical Address On x64, virtual addresses are 64 bits in width, but most processors do not sup- port a full 64-bit virtual address space. Current Intel AMD processors only use  48 bits for the address space. All virtual memory addresses must be in canonical  form. A virtual address is in canonical form if bits 63 to the most signifi cant  implemented bit are either all 1s or 0s. In practical terms, it means that bits 48–63  need to match bit 47. For example:  0xfffff801`c9c11000 = 11111111 11111111 11111000 00000001 11001001 11000001     00010000 00000000 ; canonical 0x000007f7`bdb67000 = 00000000 00000000 00000111 11110111 10111101 10110110     01110000 00000000 ; canonical 0xffff0800`00000000 = 11111111 11111111 00001000 00000000 00000000 00000000     00000000 00000000 ; non-canonical 0xffff8000`00000000 = 11111111 11111111 10000000 00000000 00000000 00000000     00000000 00000000 ; canonical 0xfffff960`000989f0 = 11111111 11111111 11111001 01100000 00000000 00001001     10001001 11110000 ; canonical  If code tries to dereference a non-canonical address, the system will cause   an exception.  Function Invocation Recall that some calling conventions require parameters to be passed on the  stack on x86. On x64, most calling conventions pass parameters through reg- isters. For example, on Windows x64, there is only one calling convention and  the fi rst four parameters are passed through RCX, RDX, R8, and R9; the remaining  are pushed on the stack from right to left. On Linux, the fi rst six parameters are  passed on RDI, RSI, RDX, RCX, R8, and R9.

This architecture proved to be useful beyond their limited product line,  so a company named ARM Holdings was formed to license the architecture for  use in a wide variety of products. It is commonly found in embedded devices  such as cell phones, automobile electronics, MP3 players, televisions, and so on.  The fi rst version of the architecture was introduced in 1985, and at the time of  this writing it is at version 7  ARMv7 . ARM has developed a number of specifi c  cores  e.g., ARM7, ARM7TDMI, ARM926EJS, Cortex —not to be confused with  the different architecture specifi cations, which are numbered ARMv1–ARMv7.  While there are several versions, most devices are either on ARMv4, 5, 6, or 7.  ARMv4 and v5 are relatively “old,” but they are also the most dominant and  common versions of the processor  “more than 10 billion” cores in existence,  according to ARM marketing . Popular consumer electronic products typically  use more recent versions of the architecture. For example, the third-generation  Apple iPod Touch and iPhone run on an ARMv6 chip, and later iPhone iPad  and Windows Phone 7 devices are all on ARMv7.  Whereas companies such as Intel and AMD design and manufacture their  processors, ARM follows a slightly different model. ARM designs the architecture  and licenses it to other companies, which then manufacture and integrate the  processors into their devices. Companies such as Apple, NVIDIA, Qualcomm,  and Texas Instruments market their own processors  A, Tegra, Snapdragon,   39  c02.indd  11:12:43:AM  01 21 2014  Page 39   40   Chapter 2   ARM  and OMAP, respectively , but their core architecture is licensed from ARM.  They all implement the base instruction set and memory model defi ned in the  ARM architecture reference manual. Additional extensions can be added to  the processor; for example, the Jazelle extension enables Java bytecode to be  executed natively on the processor. The Thumb extension adds instructions  that can be 16 or 32 bits wide, thus allowing higher code density  native ARM  instructions are always 32 bits in width . The Debug extension allows engineers  to analyze the physical processor using special debugging hardware. Each  extension is typically represented by a letter  J, T, D, etc. . Depending on their  requirements, manufacturers can decide whether they need to license these  additional extensions. This is why ARMv6 and earlier processors have letters  after them  e.g., ARM1156T2 means ARMv6 with Thumb-2 extension . These  conventions are no longer used in ARMv7, which instead uses three profi les   Application, Real-time, and Microcontroller  and model name  Cortex  with  different features. For example, ARMv7 Cortex-A series are processors with  the application profi le; and Cortex-M are meant for microcontrollers and only  support Thumb mode execution.  This chapter covers the ARMv7 architecture as defi ned in the ARM Architecture   Reference Manual: ARMv7-A and ARMv7-R Edition  ARM DDI 0406B .  Basic Features  Because ARM is a RISC architecture, there are a few basic differences between  ARM and CISC architectures  x86 x64 .  From a practical perspective, new  versions of Intel processors have some RISC features as well—i.e., they are not  “purely” CISC.  First, the ARM instruction set is very small compared to x86,  but it offers more general-purpose registers. Second, the instruction length is  fi xed width  16 bits or 32 bits, depending on the state . Third, ARM uses a load- store model for memory access. This means data must be moved from memory  into registers before being operated on, and only load store instructions can  access memory. On ARM, this translates to the LDR and STR instructions. If you  want to increment a 32-bit value at a particular memory address, you must fi rst  load the value at that address to a register, increment it, and store it back. In  contrast with x86, which allows most instructions to directly operate on data  in memory, such a simple operation on ARM would require three instructions   one load, one increment, one store . This may imply that there is more code  to read for the reverse engineer, but in practice it does not really matter much  once you are used to it.  ARM also offers several different privilege levels to implement privilege  isolation. In x86, privileges are defi ned by four rings, with ring 0 having the   c02.indd  11:12:43:AM  01 21 2014  Page 40      Chapter 2   ARM   41  highest privilege and ring 3 having the lowest. In ARM, privileges are defi ned  by eight different modes:      User  USR     Fast interrupt request  FIQ     Interrupt request  IRQ     Supervisor  SVC     Monitor  MON     Abort  ABT     Undefi ned  UND     System  SYS   Code running in a given mode has access to certain privileges and registers  that others may not; for example, code running in USR mode is not allowed  to modify system registers  which are typically modifi ed only in SVC mode .  USR is the least privileged mode. While there are many technical differences,  for the sake of simplicity you can make the analogy that USR is like ring 3 and  SVC is like ring 0. Most operating systems implement kernel mode in SVC and  user mode in USR. Both Windows and Linux do this.  If you recall from Chapter 1, x64 processors can execute in 32-bit, 64-bit, or  both interchangeably. ARM processors are similar in that they can also operate  in two states: ARM and Thumb. ARM Thumb state determines only the instruc- tion set, not the privilege level. For example, code running in SVC mode can be  either ARM or Thumb. In ARM state, instructions are always 32 bits wide; in  Thumb state, instructions can be either 16 bits or 32 bits wide. Which state the  processor executes in depends on two conditions:     When branching with the BX and BLX instruction, if the destination  register’s least signifi cant bit is 1, then it will switch to Thumb state.   Although instructions are either 2- or 4-byte aligned, the processor will  ignore the least signifi cant bit so there won’t be alignment issues.      If the T bit in the current program status register  CPSR  is set, then it is in  Thumb mode. The semantic of CPSR is explained in the following section,  but for now you can think of it as an extended EFLAGS register in x86.  When an ARM core boots up, most of the time it enters ARM state and remains  that way until there is an explicit or implicit change to Thumb. In practice, many  recent operating system code mainly uses Thumb code because higher code  density is wanted  a mixture of 16 32-bit wide instructions may be smaller in  size than all 32-bit ones ; applications can operate in whatever mode they want.   c02.indd  11:12:43:AM  01 21 2014  Page 41   42   Chapter 2   ARM  While most Thumb and ARM instructions have the same mnemonic, 32-bit  Thumb instructions have a .W suffi x.  N O T E  It is a common misconception to think that Thumb is like real mode and ARM  is like protected mode on x86 x64. Do not think of it this way. Most operating systems  on the x86 x64 platform run in protected mode and rarely, if ever, switch back to real  mode. Operating systems and applications on the ARM platform can execute both in  ARM and Thumb state interchangeably. Note also that these states are completely dif- ferent from the privilege modes explained in the previous paragraph  USR, SVC, etc. .  There are two versions of Thumb: Thumb-1 and Thumb-2. Thumb-1 was used in   ARMv6 and earlier architectures, and its instructions are always 16 bits in width.  Thumb-2 extends that by adding more instructions and allowing them to be either 16  or 32 bits in width. ARMv7 requires Thumb-2, so whenever we talk about Thumb, we  are referring to Thumb-2.  There are several other diﬀ erences between ARM and Thumb states but we cannot  cover them all here. For example, some instructions are available in ARM state but not  Thumb state, and vice versa. You can consult the oﬃ  cial ARM documentation for more  details.  In addition to having different states of execution, ARM also supports con- ditional execution. This means that an instruction encodes certain arithmetic  conditions that must be met in order for it to be executed. For example, an  instruction can specify that it will only be executed if the result of the previous  instruction is zero. Contrast this with x86, for which almost every single instruc- tion is executed unconditionally.  Intel has a couple of instructions directly  supporting conditional execution: CMOV and SETNE.  Conditional execution is  useful because it cuts down on branch instructions  which are very expensive   and reduces the number of instructions to be executed  which leads to higher  code density . All instructions in ARM state support conditional execution, but  by default they execute unconditionally. In Thumb state, a special instruction  IT is required to enable conditional execution.  Another unique ARM feature is the barrel shifter. Certain instructions can  “contain” another arithmetic instruction that shifts or rotates a register. This  is useful because it can shrink multiple instructions into one; for example, you  want to multiply a register by 2 and then store the result in another register.  Normally, this would require two instructions  a multiply followed by a move ,  but with the barrel shifter you can include the multiply  shift left by 1  inside  the MOV instruction. The instruction would be something like the following:  MOV R1, R0, LSL 1            ; R1 = R0 * 2  c02.indd  11:12:43:AM  01 21 2014  Page 42      Chapter 2   ARM   43  Data Types and Registers  Similar to high-level languages, ARM supports operations on different data  types. The supported data types are: 8-bit  byte , 16-bit  half-word , 32-bit  word ,  and 64-bit  double-word .  The ARM architecture defi nes sixteen 32-bit general-purpose registers, num- bered R0, R1, R2, . . . , R15. While all of them are available to the application pro- grammer, in practice the fi rst 12 registers are for general-purpose usage  such as  EAX, EBX, etc., in x86  and the last three have special meaning in the architecture:     R13 is denoted as the stack pointer  SP . It is the equivalent of ESP RSP in   x86 x64. It points to the top of the program stack.     R14 is denoted as the link register  LR . It normally holds the return address  during a function call. Certain instructions implicitly use this register. For  example, BL always stores the return address in LR before branching to  the destination. x86 x64 does not have an equivalent register because it  always stores the return address on the stack. In code that does not use LR  to store the return address, it can be used as a general-purpose register.    R15 is denoted as the program counter  PC . When executing in ARM state,  PC is the address of the current instruction plus 8  two ARM instructions  ahead ; in Thumb state, it is the address of the current instruction plus 4   two 16-bit Thumb instructions ahead . It is analogous to EIP RIP in x86  x64 except that they always point to the address of the next instruction to  be executed. Another major difference is that code can directly read from  and write to the PC register. Writing an address to PC will immediately  cause execution to start at that address. This can be elaborated upon a bit  further to avoid confusion. Consider the following snippet in Thumb state:  After line 2 is executed, R0 will hold the value 0x0000834a  =0x00008346+4 :  1: 0x00008344 push    {lr} 2: 0x00008346 mov     r0, pc 3: 0x00008348 mov.w   r2, r1, lsl 31 4: 0x0000834c pop     {pc}   gdb  br main  Breakpoint 1 at 0x8348 ... Breakpoint 1, 0x00008348 in main     gdb  disas main  c02.indd  11:12:43:AM  01 21 2014  Page 43   44   Chapter 2   ARM  Dump of assembler code for function main:    0x00008344  :     push    {lr}    0x00008346  :     mov     r0, pc => 0x00008348  :     mov.w   r2, r1, lsl 31    0x0000834c  :     pop     {pc}    0x0000834e  :    lsls    r0, r0, 0 End of assembler dump.  gdb  info register pc pc             0x8348   0x8348    gdb  info register r0 r0             0x834a   33610  Here we set a breakpoint at 0x00008348. When it hits, we show the PC and  R0 register; as shown, PC points to the third instruction at 0x00008348  about  to be executed  and R0 shows the previously read PC value. From this example,  you can see that when directly reading PC, it follows the defi nition; but when  debugging, PC points to the instruction that is to be executed.  The reason for this peculiarity is due to legacy pipelining from older ARM  processors, which always fetched two instructions ahead of the currently execut- ing instruction. Nowadays, the pipelines are much more complicated so this does  not really matter much, but ARM retains this defi nition to ensure compatibility  with earlier processors.  Similar to other architectures, ARM stores information about the current  execution state in the current program status register  CPSR . From an applica- tion programmer’s perspective, CPSR is similar to the EFLAGS RFLAG register  in x86 x64. Some documentation may discuss the application program status  register  APSR , which is an alias for certain fi elds in the CPSR. There are many  fl ags in the CPSR, some of which are illustrated in Figure 2-1  others are covered  in later sections .     E  Endianness bit —ARM can operate in either big or little endian mode.  This bit is set to 0 or 1 for little or big endian, respectively. Most of the  time, little endian is used, so this bit will be 0.     T  Thumb bit —This is set if you are in Thumb state; otherwise, it is ARM  state. One way to explicitly transition from Thumb to ARM  and vice  versa  is to modify this bit.     M  Mode bits —These bits specify the current privilege mode  USR, SVC, etc.   31  26  CPSR  cond. ﬂags  Figure 2-1  15  10 9  E  IT  5 4  T  M  0  c02.indd  11:12:43:AM  01 21 2014  Page 44      Chapter 2   ARM   45  System-Level Controls and Settings  ARM offers the concept of coprocessors to support additional instructions and  system-level settings. For example, if the system supports a memory management  unit  MMU , then its settings must be exposed to boot or kernel code. On x86  x64, these settings are stored in CR0 and CR4; on ARM, they are stored in copro- cessor 15. There are 16 coprocessors in the ARM architecture, each identifi ed by  a number: CP0, CP1, . . . , CP15.  When used in code, these are referred to as P0,  . . . , P15.  The fi rst 13 are either optional or reserved by ARM; the optional ones  can be used by manufacturers to implement manufacturer-specifi c instructions  or features. For example, CP10 and CP11 are usually used for fl oating-point and  NEON support. Each coprocessor contains additional “opcodes” and registers  that can be controlled through special ARM instructions. CP14 and CP15 are  used for debug and system settings; CP15, usually known as the system control  coprocessor, stores most of the system settings  caching, paging, exceptions, and  so forth .  N O T E  NEON provides the single-instruction multiple data  SIMD  instruction set  that is commonly used in multimedia applications. It is similar to SSE MMX instructions  in x86-based architectures.  Each coprocessor has 16 registers and eight corresponding opcodes. The  semantic of these registers and opcodes is specifi c to the coprocessor. Accessing  coprocessors can only be done through the MRC  read  and MCR  write  instructions;  they take a coprocessor number, register number, and opcodes. For example, to  read the translation base register  similar to CR3 in x86 x64  and save it in R0,  you use the following:  MRC p15, 0, r0, c2, c0, 0 ; save TTBR in r0  This says, “read coprocessor 15’s C2 C0 register using opcode 0 0 and store  the result in the general-purpose register R0.” Because there are so many reg- isters and opcodes within each coprocessor, you must read the documentation  to determine the precise meaning of each. Some registers  C13 C0  are reserved  for operating systems in order to store process- or thread-specifi c data.  While the MRC and MCR instructions do not require high privilege  i.e., they  can be executed in USR mode , some of the coprocessor registers and opcodes  are only accessible in SVC mode. Attempts to read certain registers without  suffi cient privilege will result in an exception. In practice, you will infrequently  see these instructions in user-mode code; they are commonly found in very  low-level code such as ROM, boot loaders, fi rmware, or kernel-mode code.  c02.indd  11:12:43:AM  01 21 2014  Page 45   46   Chapter 2   ARM  Introduction to the Instruction Set  At this point, you are ready to look at the important ARM instructions. Besides  conditional execution and barrel shifters, there are several other peculiarities  about the instructions that are not found in x86. First, some instructions can  operate on a range of registers in sequence. For example, to store fi ve registers,  R6–R10, at a particular memory location referenced by R1, you would write STM  R1, {R6-R10}. R6 would be stored at memory address R1, R7 at R1+4, R8 at R1+8,  and so on. Nonconsecutive registers can also be specifi ed via comma separa- tion  e.g., {R1,R5,R8} . In ARM assembly syntax, the register ranges are usually  specifi ed inside curly brackets. Second, some instructions can optionally update  the base register after a read write operation. This is usually done by affi xing  an exclamation mark  !  after the register name. For example, if you were to  rewrite the previous instruction as STM R1!, {R6-R10} and execute it, then R1  will be updated with the address immediately after where R10 was stored. To  make it clearer, here is an example:  01:  gdb  disas main 02: Dump of assembler code for function main: 03: => 0x00008344  :     mov     r6,  10 04:    0x00008348  :     mov     r7,  11 05:    0x0000834c  :     mov     r8,  12 06:    0x00008350  :    mov     r9,  13 07:    0x00008354  :    mov     r10, 14 08:    0x00008358  :    stmia   sp!, {r6, r7, r8, r9, r10} 09:    0x0000835c  :    bx      lr 10: End of assembler dump. 11:  gdb  si 12: 0x00008348 in main    13: ... 14: 0x00008358 in main    15:  gdb  info reg sp 16: sp             0xbedf5848       0xbedf5848 17:  gdb  si 18: 0x0000835c in main    19:  gdb  info reg sp 20: sp             0xbedf585c       0xbedf585c 21:  gdb  x 6x 0xbedf5848 22: 0xbedf5848:     0x0000000a      0x0000000b      0x0000000c       0x0000000d 23: 0xbedf5858:     0x0000000e      0x00000000  Line 15 displays the value of SP  0xbedf5848  before executing the STM instruc- tion; lines 17 and 19 execute the STM instruction and display the updated value  of SP. Line 21 dumps six words starting at the old value of SP. Note that R6 was  stored at the old SP, R7 at SP+0x4, R8 at SP+0x8, R9 at SP+0xc, and R10 at SP+0x10.  The new SP  0xbedf585c  is immediately after where R10 was stored.  c02.indd  11:12:43:AM  01 21 2014  Page 46      Chapter 2   ARM   47  N O T E  STMIA and STMEA are pseudo-instructions for STM—that is, they have the  same meaning. Disassemblers can pick either one to display. Some will show STMEA if  the base register is SP, and STMIA for other registers; some always use STM; and some  always use STMIA. There is no strict rule, so you have to get used to this if you are  using multiple disassemblers.  Loading and Storing Data  The preceding section mentions that ARM is a load-store architecture, which  means that data must be loaded into registers before it can be operated on. The  only instructions that can touch memory are load and store; all other instruc- tions can operate only on registers. To load means to read data from memory  and save it in a register; to store means to write the content of a register to a  memory location. On ARM, the load store instructions are LDR STR, LDM STM,  and PUSH POP.  LDR and STR These instructions can load and store 1, 2, or 4 bytes to and from memory. Their  full syntax is somewhat complicated because there are several different ways  to specify the offset and side effects for updating the base register. Consider  the simplest case:  01: 03 68         LDR             R3, [R0] ; R3 = *R0 02: 23 60         STR             R3, [R4] ; *R4 = R3;  For the instruction in line 1, R0 is the base register and R3 is the destination;  it loads the word value at address R0 into R3. In line 2, R4 is the base register  and R3 is the destination; it takes the value in R3 and stores at the memory  address R4. This example is simple because the memory address is specifi ed  by the base register.  At a fundamental level, the LDR STR instructions take a base register and an  offset; there are three offset forms and three addressing modes for each form.  We begin by discussing the offset forms: immediate, register, and scaled register. The fi rst offset form uses an immediate as the offset. An immediate is simply  an integer. It is added to or subtracted from the base register to access data at an  offset known at compile time. The most common usage is to access a particular  fi eld in a structure or vtable. The general format is as follows:     STR Ra, [Rb, imm]    LDR Ra, [Rc, imm]  c02.indd  11:12:43:AM  01 21 2014  Page 47   48   Chapter 2   ARM  following code: Structure Deﬁ nition  Rb is the base register, and imm is the offset to be added to Rb. For example, suppose that R0 holds a pointer to a KDPC structure and the   0:000> dt ntkrnlmp!_KDPC    +0x000 Type             : UChar    +0x001 Importance       : UChar    +0x002 Number           : Uint2B    +0x004 DpcListEntry     : _LIST_ENTRY    +0x00c DeferredRoutine  : Ptr32     void    +0x010 DeferredContext  : Ptr32 Void    +0x014 SystemArgument1  : Ptr32 Void    +0x018 SystemArgument2  : Ptr32 Void    +0x01c DpcData          : Ptr32 Void  Code  01: 13 23         MOVS    R3, 0x13 02: 03 70         STRB    R3, [R0] 03: 01 23         MOVS    R3, 1 04: 43 70         STRB    R3, [R0,1] 05: 00 23         MOVS    R3, 0 06: 43 80         STRH    R3, [R0,2] 07: C3 61         STR     R3, [R0,0x1C] 08: C1 60         STR     R1, [R0,0xC] 09: 02 61         STR     R2, [R0,0x10]  In this case, R0 is the base register and the immediates are 0x1, 0x2, 0xC, 0x10,   and 0x1C. The snippet can be translated into C as follows:  KDPC *obj = ...;              * R0 is obj *  obj->Type = 0x13; obj->Importance = 0x1; obj->Number = 0x0; obj->DpcData = NULL; obj->DeferredRoutine = R1;    * R1 is unknown to us *  obj->DeferredContext = R2;    * R2 is unknown to us *   This offset form is similar to the MOV Reg, [Reg + Imm] on the x86 x64. The second offset form uses a register as the offset. It is commonly used in  code that needs to access an array but the index is computed at runtime. The  general format is as follows:     STR Ra, [Rb, Rc]    LDR Ra, [Rb, Rc]  c02.indd  11:12:43:AM  01 21 2014  Page 48      Chapter 2   ARM   49  Depending on the context, either Rb or Rc can be the base offset. Consider   the following two examples: Example 1  01: 03 F0 F2 FA   BL  strlen 02: 06 46         MOV R6, R0 ; R0 is strlen's return value 03: ... 04: BB 57         LDRSB R3, [R7,R6] ; in this case, R6 is the offset  Example 2  01: B3 EB 05 08   SUBS.W  R8, R3, R5 02: 2F 78         LDRB    R7, [R5] 03: 18 F8 05 30   LDRB.W  R3, [R8,R5] ; here, R5 is the base and R8 is the offset 04: 9F 42         CMP     R7, R3  This is similar to the MOV Reg, [Reg + Reg] form on x86 x64. The third offset form uses a scaled register as the offset. It is commonly used  in a loop to iterate over an array. The barrel shifter is used to scale the offset.  The general format is as follows:     LDR Ra, [Rb, Rc,  ]    STR Ra, [Rb, Rc,  ]  Rb is the base register; Rc is an immediate; and   is the operation  performed on the immediate—typically, a left right shift to scale the immediate.  For example:  01: 0E 4B         LDR     R3, =KeNumberNodes 02: ... 03: 00 24         MOVS    R4, 0 04: 19 88         LDRH    R1, [R3] 05: 09 48         LDR     R0, =KeNodeBlock 06: 00 23         MOVS    R3, 0 07:             loop_start 08: 50 F8 23 20   LDR.W   R2, [R0,R3,LSL2] 09: 00 23         MOVS    R3, 0 10: A2 F8 90 30   STRH.W  R3, [R2,0x90] 11: 92 F8 89 30   LDRB.W  R3, [R2,0x89] 12: 53 F0 02 03   ORRS.W  R3, R3, 2 13: 82 F8 89 30   STRB.W  R3, [R2,0x89] 14: 63 1C         ADDS    R3, R4, 1 15: 9C B2         UXTH    R4, R3 16: 23 46         MOV     R3, R4 17: 8C 42         CMP     R4, R1 18: EF DB         BLT     loop_start  c02.indd  11:12:43:AM  01 21 2014  Page 49   50   Chapter 2   ARM  KeNumberNodes and KeNodeBlock are a global integer and an array of KNODE   pointers, respectively.  Lines 1 and 5 simply load those globals into a register  we explain this syntax  later . Line 8 iterates over the KeNodeBlock array  R0 is the base , R3 is the index  multiplied by 2  because it is an array of pointers; pointers are 4 bytes in size on  this platform . Lines 10–13 initialize some fi elds of the KNODE element. Line 14  increments the index. Line 17 compares the index against the size of the array   R1 is the size; see line 4  and if it is less than the size then continues the loop.  This snippet can be roughly translated to C as follows:  int KeNumberNodes = …; KNODE *KeNodeBlock[KeNumberNodes] = …; for  int i=0; i < KeNumberNodes; i++  {     KeNodeBlock[i].x = …;     KeNodeBlock[i].y = …;     … }  This is similar to the MOV, Reg, [Reg + idx * scale] form on x86 x64. Having covered the three offset forms, the rest of this section discusses address- ing modes: offset, pre-indexed, and post-indexed. The only distinction among  them is whether the base register is modifi ed and, if so, in what way. All the  preceding offset examples use offset addressing mode, which means that  the base register is never modifi ed. This is the simplest and most common mode.  You can quickly recognize it because it does not contain an exclamation mark  !   anywhere and the immediate is inside the square brackets.  Some publications  categorize these modes as pre-index, pre-index with writeback, and post-index.  The terminology used here refl ects the offi cial ARM documentation.  The general  syntax for the offset mode is LDR Rd, [Rn, offset].  Pre-indexed address mode means that the base register will be updated with  the fi nal memory address used in the reference operation. The semantic is very  similar to the prefi x form of the unary ++ and -- operator in C. The syntax for  this mode is LDR Rd, [Rn, offset]!. For example:  12 F9 01 3D   LDRSB.W R3, [R2 ,-1]! ; R3 = * R2-1                                       ; R2 = R2-1  Post-indexed address mode means that the base register is used as the fi nal  address, then updated with the offset calculated. This is very similar to the  postfi x form of the unary ++ and -- operator in C. The syntax for this mode is  LDR Rd, [Rn], offset. For example:  10 F9 01 6B   LDRSB.W R6, [R0],1  ; R6 = *R0                                    ; R0 = R0+1  c02.indd  11:12:43:AM  01 21 2014  Page 50      Chapter 2   ARM   51  The pre- and post-index forms are normally observed in code that accesses  an offset in the same buffer multiple times. For example, suppose the code  needs to loop and check whether a character in a string matches one of fi ve  characters; the compiler may update the base pointer so that it can shave off an  increment instruction.  N O T E  Here’s a tip to recognize and remember the diﬀ erent address modes in LDR  STR: If there is a !, then it is preﬁ x; if the base register is in brackets by itself, then it is  postﬁ x; anything else is oﬀ set mode.  Other Usage for LDR As explained earlier, LDR is used to load data from memory into a register;  however, sometimes you see it in these forms:  01: DF F8 50 82   LDR.W   R8, =0x2932E00 ; LDR R8, [PC, x] 02: 80 4A         LDR     R2, =a04d ; "%04d" ; LDR R2, [PC, y] 03: 0E 4B         LDR     R3, =__imp_realloc ; LDR R3, [PC, z]  Clearly, this is not valid syntax according to the previous section. Technically,  these are called pseudo-instructions and they are used by disassemblers to make  manual inspection easier. Internally, they use the immediate form of LDR with PC  as a base register; sometimes, this is called PC-relative addressing  or RIP-relative  addressing on x64 . ARM binaries usually have a literal pool that is a memory  area in a section to store constants, strings, or offsets that others can reference  in a position-independent manner.  The literal pool is part of the code, so it will  be in the same section.  In the preceding snippet, the code is referencing a 32-bit  constant, a string, and an offset to an imported function stored in the literal pool.  This particular pseudo-instruction is useful because it allows a 32-bit constant  to be moved into a register in one instruction. To make it clearer, consider the  following snippet:  01: .text:0100B134 35 4B   LDR    R3, =0x68DB8BAD                 ; actually LDR R3, [PC, 0xD4]                 ; at this point, PC = 0x0100B138 02: ... 03: .text:0100B20C AD 8B DB 68 dword_100B20C DCD 0x68DB8BAD  How did the disassembler shorten the first instruction from LDR  R3,  [PC, 0xD4] to the alternate form? Because the code is in Thumb state, PC is  the current instruction plus 4, which is 0x0100B138; it is using the immediate  form of PC, so it is trying to read the word at 0x0100B20C  =0x100B138+0xD4 ,  which happens to be the constant we want to load.  c02.indd  11:12:43:AM  01 21 2014  Page 51   52   Chapter 2   ARM  Another related instruction is ADR, which gets the address for a label function   and puts it in a register. For example:  01: 00009390 65 A5         ADR     R5, dword_9528 02: 00009392 D5 E9 00 45   LDRD.W  R4, R5, [R5] 03: ... 04: 00009528 00 CE 22 A9+dword_9528 DCD 0xA922CE00 , 0xC0A4  This instruction is typically used to implement jump tables or callbacks where  you need to pass the address of a function to another. Internally, this instruction  just calculates an offset from PC and saves it in the destination register.  LDM and STM  LDM and STM are similar to LDR STR except that they load and store multiple  words at a given base register. They are useful when moving multiple data  blocks to and from memory. The general syntax is as follows:     LDM  Rn[!], {Rm}    STM  Rn[!], {Rm}  Rn is the base register and it holds the memory address to load store from; the  optional exclamation mark  !  means that the base register should be updated  with the new address  writeback . Rm is the range of register to load store. There  are four modes:     IA  Increment After —Stores data starting at the memory location speci- fi ed by the base address. If there is writeback, then the address 4 bytes  above the last location is written back. This is the default mode if nothing  is specifi ed.     IB  Increment Before —Stores data starting at the memory location 4 bytes  above the base address. If there is writeback, then the address of the last  location is written back.     DA  Decrement After —Stores data such that the last location is the base  address. If there is writeback, then the address 4 bytes below the lowest  location is written back.     DB  Decrement Before —Stores data such that the last location is 4 bytes  below the base address. If there is writeback, then the address of the fi rst  location is written back.  This may sound a bit confusing at fi rst, so let’s walk through an example   with the debugger:  01:  gdb  br main 02: Breakpoint 1 at 0x8344 03:  gdb  disas main 04: Dump of assembler code for function main:  c02.indd  11:12:43:AM  01 21 2014  Page 52      Chapter 2   ARM   53  05:    0x00008344  :     ldr     r6, =mem  ; edited a bit 06:    0x00008348  :     mov     r0, 10 07:    0x0000834c  :     mov     r1, 11 08:    0x00008350  :    mov     r2, 12 09:    0x00008354  :    ldm     r6, {r3, r4, r5}  ; IA mode 10:    0x00008358  :    stm     r6, {r0, r1, r2}  ; IA mode 11: ... 12:  gdb  r 13: Breakpoint 1, 0x00008344 in main    14:  gdb  si 15: 0x00008348 in main    16:  gdb  x 3x $r6 17: 0x1050c  :  0x00000001      0x00000002      0x00000003 18:  gdb  si 19: 0x0000834c in main    20: ... 21:  gdb  22: 0x00008358 in main    23:  gdb  info reg r3 r4 r5 24: r3             0x1      1 25: r4             0x2      2 26: r5             0x3      3 27:  gdb  si 28: 0x0000835c in main    29:  gdb  x 3x $r6 30: 0x1050c  :  0x0000000a      0x0000000b      0x0000000c  Line 5 stores a memory address in R6; the content of this memory address   0x1050c  is three words  line 17 .

For example, they are sometimes used  to inline memcpy when the copy length is known at compile time. They are simi- lar to the MOVS instruction with the REP prefi x on x86. Consider the following  blobs of code generated by two different compilers from the same source fi le: Compiler A  01: A4 46         MOV      R12, R4 02: 35 46         MOV      R5, R6 03: BC E8 0F 00   LDMIA.W  R12!, {R0-R3} 04: 0F C5         STMIA    R5!, {R0-R3} 05: BC E8 0F 00   LDMIA.W  R12!, {R0-R3} 06: 0F C5         STMIA    R5!, {R0-R3} 07: 9C E8 0F 00   LDMIA.W  R12, {R0-R3} 08: 85 E8 0F 00   STMIA.W  R5, {R0-R3}  Compiler B  01: 30 22         MOVS   R2, 0x30 02: 21 46         MOV    R1, R4 03: 30 46         MOV    R0, R6 04: 23 F0 17 FA   BL     memcpy  All this does is copy 48 bytes from one buffer to another; the fi rst compiler  uses LDM STM with writebacks to load store 16 bytes at a time, while the second  simply calls into its implementation of memcpy. When reverse engineering code,  you can spot the inlined memcpy form by recognizing that the same source and  destination pointers are being used by LDM STM with the same register set.  This is a good trick to keep in mind because you will see it often.  Another common place where LDM STM can be seen is at the beginning and  end of functions in ARM state. In this context, they are used as the prologue  and epilogue. For example:  01: F0 4F 2D E9   STMFD   SP!, {R4-R11,LR}  ; save regs + return address 02: ... 03: F0 8F BD E8   LDMFD   SP!, {R4-R11,PC}  ; restore regs and return  STMFD and LDMFD are pseudo-instructions for STMDB and LMDIA LDM, respectively.  N O T E  You will often see the suﬃ  xes FD, FA, ED, or EA after STM LDM. They are  simply pseudo-instructions for the LDM STM instructions in diﬀ erent modes  IA, IB,  etc. . The association is STMFD STMDB, STMFA STMIB, STMED STMDA, STMEA STMIA,  LDMFD LDMIA, LDMFA LDMDA, and LDMEA LDMDB. It can be somewhat challenging  to memorize these associations—the most eﬀ ective way is to draw pictures for each  instruction.  c02.indd  11:12:43:AM  01 21 2014  Page 55   56   Chapter 2   ARM  PUSH and POP The fi nal set of load store instructions is PUSH and POP. They are similar to LDM  STM except for two characteristics:     They implicitly use SP as the base address.    SP is automatically updated. The stack grows downward to lower addresses as it does in the x86 x64  architecture. The general syntax is PUSH POP {Rn}, where Rn can be a range of  registers.  PUSH stores the registers on the stack such that the last location is 4 bytes below  the current stack pointer, and updates SP with the address of the fi rst location.  POP loads the registers starting from the current stack pointer and updates SP  with the address 4 bytes above the last location. PUSH POP are actually the same  as STMDB LDMIA with writeback and SP as the base pointer. Here is a short walk- through demonstrating the instructions:  01:  gdb  disas main 02: Dump of assembler code for function main: 03:    0x00008344  :     mov.w   r0, 10 04:    0x00008348  :     mov.w   r1, 11 05:    0x0000834c  :     mov.w   r2, 12 06:    0x00008350  :    push    {r0, r1, r2} 07:    0x00008352  :    pop     {r3, r4, r5} 08: ... 09:  gdb  br main 10: Breakpoint 1 at 0x8344 11:  gdb  r 12: Breakpoint 1, 0x00008344 in main    13:  gdb  si 14: 0x00008348 in main    15: ... 16:  gdb  17: 0x00008350 in main    18:  gdb  info reg sp        ; current stack pointer 19: sp             0xbee56848       0xbee56848 20:  gdb  si 21: 0x00008352 in main    22:  gdb  x 3x $sp           ; sp is updated after the push 23: 0xbee5683c:     0x0000000a      0x0000000b      0x0000000c 24:  gdb  si                 ; pop into the registers 25: 0x00008354 in main    26:  gdb  info reg r3 r4 r5  ; new registers 27: r3             0xa      10 28: r4             0xb      11 29: r5             0xc      12 30:  gdb  info reg sp        ; new sp  4 bytes above the last location  31: sp             0xbee56848       0xbee56848 32:  gdb  x 3x $sp-12 33: 0xbee5683c:     0x0000000a      0x0000000b      0x0000000c  c02.indd  11:12:43:AM  01 21 2014  Page 56      Chapter 2   ARM   57  Figure 2-4 illustrates the preceding snippet.  mov.w r0, 10 mov.w r1, 11 mov.w r2, 12 push {r0, r1, r2}  pop {r3, r4, r5}  0×A 0×B 0×C  sp 0×bee56848−c 0×bee56848−8 0×bee56848−4 0×bee56848 0×bee56848+4 0×bee56848+8 0×bee56848+c  0×A 0×B 0×C  0×bee56848−c 0×bee56848−8 0×bee56848−4  sp 0×bee56848  0×bee56848+4 0×bee56848+8 0×bee56848+c  r0=a r1=b r2=c  r0=a r1=b r2=c r3=a r4=b r5=c  0×bee56848−c 0×bee56848−8 0×bee56848−4  sp 0×bee56848  0×bee56848+4 0×bee56848+8 0×bee56848+c  Figure 2-4  The most common place for PUSH POP is at the beginning and end of func- tions. In this context, they are used as the prologue and epilogue  like STMFD  LDMFD in ARM state . For example:  01: 2D E9 F0 4F   PUSH.W  {R4-R11,LR} ; save registers + return address 02: ... 03: BD E8 F0 8F   POP.W   {R4-R11,PC} ; restore registers and return  Some disassemblers actually use this pattern as a heuristic to determine   function boundaries.  Functions and Function Invocation  Unlike x86 x64, which has only one instruction for function invocation  CALL   and branching  JMP , ARM offers several depending on how the destination  is encoded. When you call a function, the processor needs to know where to  resume execution after the function returns; this location is typically referred  to as the return address. In x86, the CALL instruction implicitly pushes the return  address on the stack before jumping to the target function; when it is done execut- ing, the target function resumes execution at the return address by popping it  off the stack into EIP.  The mechanism on ARM is essentially the same with a few minor differ- ences. First, the return address can be stored on the stack or in the link register   LR ; to resume execution after the call, the return address is explicitly popped  off the stack into PC or there will be an unconditional branch to LR. Second, a   c02.indd  11:12:43:AM  01 21 2014  Page 57   58   Chapter 2   ARM  branch can switch between ARM and Thumb state, depending on the destina- tion address’s LSB. Third, a standard calling convention is defi ned by ARM:  The fi rst four 32-bit parameters are passed via registers  R0-R3  and the rest are  on the stack. Return value is stored in R0.  The instructions used for function invocations are B, BX, BL, and BLX. Although it is rare to see B used in the context of function invocation, it can be  used for transfer of control. It is simply an unconditional branch and is identical  to the JMP instruction in x86. It is normally used inside of loops and conditionals to  go back to the beginning or break out; it can also be used to call a function  that never returns. B can only use label offsets as its destination; it cannot use  registers. In this context, the syntax of B is as follows: B imm, where imm is an  offset relative from the current instruction.  This does not take into consider- ation the conditional execution fl ags, which are discussed in the “Branching  and Conditional Execution” section.  One important fact to note is that because  ARM and Thumb instructions are 4- and 2-byte aligned, the target offset needs  to be an even number. Here is a snippet showing the usage of B:  01: 0001C788   B         loc_1C7A8 02: 0001C78A 03: 0001C78A loc_1C78A 04: 0001C78A   LDRB      R7, [R6,R2] 05: ... 06: 0001C7A4   STRB.W    R7, [R3,-1] 07: 0001C7A8 08: 0001C7A8 loc_1C7A8 09: 0001C7A8   MOV       R7, R3 10: 0001C7AA   ADDS      R3, 2 11: 0001C7AC   CMP       R2, R4 12: 0001C7AE   BLT       loc_1C78A  In line 1, you see B being used as an unconditional jump to start off a loop.   You can ignore the other instructions for now.  BX is Branch and Exchange. It is similar to B in that it transfers control to  a target, but it has the ability to switch between ARM Thumb state, and the  target address is stored in a register. Branching instructions that end with X  indicate that they are capable of switching between states. If the LSB of the  target address is 1, then the processor automatically switches to Thumb state;  otherwise, it executes in ARM state. The instruction format is BX  ,  where register holds the destination address. The two most common uses of  this instruction are returning from a function by branching to LR  i.e., BX LR   and transferring of control to code in a different mode  i.e., going from ARM  to Thumb or vice versa . In compiled code, you will almost always see BX LR at  the end of functions; it is basically the same as RET in x86.  BL is Branch with Link. It is similar to B except that it also stores the return  address in LR before transferring control to the target offset. This is probably the  closest equivalence to the CALL instruction in x86 and you will often see it used   c02.indd  11:12:43:AM  01 21 2014  Page 58      Chapter 2   ARM   59  to invoke functions. The instruction format is the same as B  that is, it takes only  offsets . Here is a short snippet demonstrating function invocation and returning:  01: 00014350   BL              foo ; LR = 0x00014354 02: 00014354   MOVS            R4, 0x15 03: ... 04: 0001B224 foo 05: 0001B224   PUSH            {R1-R3} 06: 0001B226   MOV             R3, 0x61240 07: ... 08: 0001B24C   BX              LR  ; return to 0x00014354  Line 1 calls the function foo using BL; before transferring control to the des- tination, BL stores the return address  0x000014354  in LR. foo does some work  and returns to the caller  BX LR .  BLX is Branch with Link and Exchange. It is like BL with the option to switch  state. The major difference is that BLX can take either a register or an offset as its  branch destination; in the case where BLX uses an offset, the processor always  swaps state  ARM to Thumb and vice versa . Because it shares the same charac- teristics as BL, you can also think of it as the equivalent of the CALL instruction in  x86. In practice, both BL and BLX are used to call functions. BL is typically used if  the function is within a 32MB range, and BLX is used whenever the target range  is undetermined  like a function pointer . When operating in Thumb state, BLX is  usually used to call library routines; in ARM state, BL is used instead.  Having explored all instructions related to unconditional branching and  direct function invocation, and how to return from a function  BX LR , you can  consolidate your knowledge by looking at a full routine:  01: 0100C388             ; void *__cdecl mystery int  02: 0100C388             mystery 03: 0100C388 2D E9 30 48   PUSH.W  {R4,R5,R11,LR} 04: 0100C38C 0D F2 08 0B   ADDW    R11, SP, 8 05: 0100C390 0C 4B         LDR     R3, =__imp_malloc 06: 0100C392 C5 1D         ADDS    R5, R0, 7 07: 0100C394 6F F3 02 05   BFC.W   R5, 0, 3 08: 0100C398 1B 68         LDR     R3, [R3] 09: 0100C39A 15 F1 08 00   ADDS.W  R0, R5, 8 10: 0100C39E 98 47         BLX     R3 11: 0100C3A0 04 46         MOV     R4, R0 12: 0100C3A2 24 B1         CBZ     R4, loc_100C3AE 13: 0100C3A4 EB 17         ASRS    R3, R5, 0x1F 14: 0100C3A6 63 60         STR     R3, [R4,4] 15: 0100C3A8 25 60         STR     R5, [R4] 16: 0100C3AA 08 34         ADDS    R4, 8 17: 0100C3AC 04 E0         B       loc_100C3B8 18: 0100C3AE             loc_100C3AE 19: 0100C3AE 04 49         LDR     R1, =aFailed ; "failed..." 20: 0100C3B0 2A 46         MOV     R2, R5 21: 0100C3B2 07 20         MOVS    R0, 7  c02.indd  11:12:43:AM  01 21 2014  Page 59   60   Chapter 2   ARM  22: 0100C3B4 01 F0 14 FC   BL      foo 23: 0100C3B8 24: 0100C3B8             loc_100C3B8 25: 0100C3B8 20 46         MOV     R0, R4 26: 0100C3BA BD E8 30 88   POP.W   {R4,R5,R11,PC} 27: 0100C3BA             ; End of function mystery  This function covers several of the ideas discussed earlier  ignore the other      Line 3 is the prologue, using the PUSH {..., LR} sequence; L26 is the   instructions for now :  epilogue.

Arithmetic Operations  After loading a value from memory into a register, the code can move it around  and perform operations on it. The simplest operation is to move it to another  register with the MOV instruction. The source can be a constant, a register, or  something processed by the barrel shifter. Here are examples of its usage:  01: 4F F0 0A 00   MOV.W   R0, 0xA  ; r0 = 0xa 02: 38 46         MOV     R0, R7    ; r0 = r7 03: A4 4A A0 E1   MOV     R4, R4, LSR 21 ; r4 =  r4>>21   Line 3 shows the source operand being processed by the barrel shifter before  being moved to the destination. The barrel shifter’s operations include left shift   LSL , right shift  LSR, ASR , and rotate  ROR, RRX . The barrel shifter is useful  because it allows the instruction to work on constants that cannot normally be  encoded in immediate form. ARM and Thumb instructions can be either 16 or  32 bits wide, so they cannot directly have 32-bit constants as a parameter; with  the barrel shifter, an immediate can be transformed into a larger value and  moved to another register. Another way to move a 32-bit constant into a register  is to split the constant into two 16-bit halves and move them one a time; this is  normally done with the MOVW and MOVT instructions. MOVT sets the top 16 bits of  a register, and MOVW sets the bottom 16 bits.  The basic arithmetic and logical operations are ADD, SUB, MUL, AND, ORR, and   EOR. Here are examples of their usage:  01: 4B 44         ADD      R3, R9           ; r3 = r3+r9 02: 0D F2 08 0B   ADDW     R11, SP, 8      ; r11 = sp+8 03: 04 EB 80 00   ADD.W    R0, R4, R0,LSL2 ; r0 = r4 +  r0<<2  04: EA B0         SUB      SP, SP, 0x1A8   ; sp = sp-0x1a8  c02.indd  11:12:43:AM  01 21 2014  Page 60      Chapter 2   ARM   61  05: 03 FB 05 F2   MUL.W    R2, R3, R5       ; r2 = r3*r5  32bit result  06: 14 F0 07 02   ANDS.W   R2, R4, 7       ; r2 = r4 & 7  flag  07: 83 EA C1 03   EOR.W    R3, R3, R1,LSL3 ; r3 = r3 ^  r1<<3  08: 53 40         EORS     R3, R2           ; r3 = r3 ^ r2  flag  09: 43 EA 02 23   ORR.W    R3, R3, R2,LSL8 ; r3 = r3   r2<<8  10: 53 F0 02 03   ORRS.W   R3, R3, 2       ; r3 = r3  2  flag  11: 13 43         ORRS     R3, R2           ; r3 = r3  r2  flag   Note the “S” after some of these instructions. Unlike x86, ARM arithmetic  instructions do not set the conditional fl ag by default. The “S” suffi x indicates  that the instruction should set arithmetic conditional fl ags  zero, negative, etc.   depending on its result. Note that the MUL instruction truncates the result such  that only the bottom 32 bits are stored in the destination register; for full 64-bit  multiplication, use the SMULL and UMULL instructions  see ARM TRM for the details . Where is the divide instruction? ARM does not have a native divide instruc- tion.  ARMv7-R and ARMv7-M cores have SDIV and UDIV, but they are not  discussed here.  In practice, the runtime will have a software implementation  for division and code simply call into it when needed. Here is an example with  the Windows C runtime:  01: 41 46         MOV             R1, R8 02: 30 46         MOV             R0, R6 03: 35 F0 9E FF   BL              __rt_udiv ; software implementation of udiv  Branching and Conditional Execution  Every example discussed so far has been executed in a linear manner. Most pro- grams will have conditionals and loops. At the assembly level, these constructs  are implemented using conditional fl ags, which are stored in the application  program status register  APSR . The APSR is an alias of the CPSR and is similar to  the EFLAG in x86. Figure 2-5 illustrates the relevant fl ags, described as follows:    N  Negative fl ag —It is set when the result of an operation is negative  the   result’s most signifi cant bit is 1 .     Z  Zero fl ag —It is set when the result of an operation is zero.    C  Carry fl ag —It is set when the result of an operation between two      V  Overfl ow fl ag —It is set when the result of an operation between two   unsigned values overfl ows.  signed values overfl ows.     IT  If-then bits —These encode various conditions for the Thumb instruc-  tion IT. They are discussed later.  The N, Z, C, and V bits are identical to the SF, ZF, CF, and OF bits in the EFLAG  register on x86. They are used to implement conditionals and loops in higher- level languages; they are also used to support conditional execution at the   c02.indd  11:12:43:AM  01 21 2014  Page 61   62   Chapter 2   ARM  instruction level. Equality is described in terms of these fl ags. Table 2-1 shows  common relationships and corresponding fl ags.  31  26  CPSR  cond. ﬂags  APSR  N Z C V Q  31  26  Figure 2-5  Table 2-1: Conditional code and meaning  SUFFIX CODE MEANING  15  15  10 9  E  IT  5 4  T  M  Reserved  0  0  EQ  NE  MI  PL  HI  LS  GE  LT  GT  LE  Equal  Not equal  Minus, negative  Plus, positive, or zero  Unsigned higher above  Unsigned lower below  Signed greater than or equal  Signed less than  Signed greater than  Signed less than or equal  FLAGS  Z==1  Z==0  N==1  N==0  N==V  N!=V  C==1 and Z==0  C==0 or Z==1  Z==0 and N==V  Z==1 or N!=V  Instructions can be conditionally executed by adding one of these suffi xes at  the end. For example, BLT means to branch if the LT condition is true.  This is  the same as JL in x86.  By default, instructions do not update conditional fl ags  unless the “S” suffi x is used; the comparison instructions  CBZ, CMP, TST, CMN,  and TEQ  update the fl ags automatically because they are usually used before  branch instructions.  The most common comparison instruction is probably CMP. Its syntax is CMP  Rn, X, where Rn is a register and X can be an immediate, a register, or a barrel  shift operation. Its semantic is identical to that in x86: It performs Rn - X, sets  the appropriate fl ags, and discards the result. It is usually followed by a condi- tional branch. Here is an example of its usage and pseudo-code: ARM  01: B3 EB E7 7F   CMP.W     R3, R7, ASR 31 02: 05 DB         BLT       loc_less 03: 01 DC         BGT       loc_greater 04: BD 42         CMP       R5, R7 05: 02 D9         BLS       loc_less  c02.indd  11:12:43:AM  01 21 2014  Page 62      Chapter 2   ARM   63  06:             loc_greater 07: 07 3D         SUBS      R5, 7 08: 6E F1 00 0E   SBC.W     LR, LR, 0 09:             loc_less 10: A5 FB 08 12   UMULL.W   R1, R2, R5, R8 11: 87 FB 08 04   SMULL.W   R0, R4, R7, R8 12: 0E FB 08 23   MLA.W     R3, LR, R8, R2  Pseudo C  if  r3 < r7  { goto loc_less; }  else if   r3 > r7  { goto loc_greater; } else if   r5 < r7  { goto loc_less; }  The next most common comparison instruction is TST; its syntax is identical  to that of CMP. Its semantic is identical to TEST in x86: It performs Rn & X, sets  the appropriate fl ags, and discards the result. It is usually used to test whether  a value is equal to another or to test for fl ags. Like most compare instructions,  it is typically followed by a conditional branch. Here is an example:  01: AB 8A         LDRH     R3, [R5,0x14] 02: 13 F0 02 0F   TST.W    R3, 2 03: 09 D0         BEQ      loc_10179DA 04: ... 05:             loc_10179BE 06: AA 8A         LDRH     R2, [R5,0x14] 07: 12 F0 04 0F   TST.W    R2, 4 08: 02 D0         BEQ      loc_10179E8  In Thumb-2 state, there are two popular comparison instructions: CBZ and  CBNZ. Their syntax is simple: CBZ CBNZ Rn, label, where Rn is a register and  label is an offset to branch to if the condition is true. CBZ then branches to label  if the register is zero. CBNZ is same except that it checks for a non-zero condition.  These instructions are usually used to determine whether a number is 0 or a  pointer is NULL. Here is a typical usage: ARM  01: 10 F0 48 FF   BL          foo              ; foo returns a pointer in r0 02: 28 B1         CBZ         R0, loc_100BC8E 03: ... 04:             loc_100BC8E 05: 01 20         MOVS        R0, 1 06: 28 E0         B           locret_100BCE4 07: ... 08:             locret_100BCE4 09: BD E8 F8 89   POP.W       {R3-R8,R11,PC}  Pseudo C  type *a; a = foo ... ; if  a == NULL  { return 1; }  c02.indd  11:12:43:AM  01 21 2014  Page 63   64   Chapter 2   ARM  The other comparison instructions are CMN TEQ, which performs addition  exclusive-or on the operands. Because they are not commonly used they are  not covered here.  You have seen that the branch instruction  B  can be made to do conditional  branches by adding a suffi x  BEQ, BLE, BLT, BLS, etc. . In fact, most ARM instruc- tions can be conditionally executed in the same way. If the condition is not met,  the instruction can be seen as a no-op. Instruction-level conditional execution  can reduce branches, which may speed up execution time. Here is an example: ARM  01: 00 00 50 E3   CMP     R0, 0 02: 01 00 A0 03   MOVEQ   R0, 1 03: 68 00 D0 15   LDRNEB  R0, [R0,0x68] 04: 1E FF 2F E1   BX      LR  Pseudo C  unk_type *a = ...; if  a == NULL  { return 1; } else { return a->off_48; }  You immediately know that R0 is a pointer because of the LDR instruction  in line 3. Line 1 checks whether R0 is NULL. If true  EQ , then line 2 sets R0 to  1; otherwise, NEQ loads the value at R0+0x68 into R0  line 3  and then returns.  Because EQ and NEQ cannot be true at the same time, only one of the instructions  will be executed. Note that there are no branch instructions.  Thumb State Unlike most ARM instructions, Thumb instructions cannot be conditionally  executed  with the exception of B  without the IT  if-then  instruction. This is  a Thumb-2-specifi c instruction that allows up to four instructions after it to be  conditionally executed. The general syntax is as follows: ITxyz cc, where cc  is the conditional code for the fi rst instruction; x, y, and z describe the condi- tion for the second, third, and fourth instruction, respectively. Conditions for  instructions after the fi rst are described by one of two letters: T or E. T means  that the condition must match cc to be executed; E means to execute only if the  condition is the inverse of cc. Consider the following example: ARM  01: 00 2B         CMP     R3, 0            ; check and set condition 02: 12 BF         ITEE NE            ; begin IT block 03: BC FA 8C F0   CLZNE.W R0, R12            ; first instruction  c02.indd  11:12:43:AM  01 21 2014  Page 64      Chapter 2   ARM   65  04: B6 FA 86 F0   CLZEQ.W R0, R6            ; second instruction 05: 20 30         ADDEQ   R0, 0x20            ; third instruction  Pseudo C  if  R3 != 0  {  R0 = countleadzeros R12 ; } else {  R0 = countleadzeros R6 ;  R0 += 0x20 }  Line 1 performs a comparison and sets a conditional fl ag. Line 2 specifi es  the conditions and start the if-then block. NE is the execution condition for the  fi rst instruction; the fi rst E  after IT  indicates that the execution condition for  the second instruction is the inverse of the fi rst.  EQ is the inverse of NE.  The  second E indicates the same for the third instruction. Lines 3–5 are instructions  inside the IT block.  Due to its fl exibility, the IT instruction can be used to reduce the number of   instructions required to implement short conditionals in Thumb state.  Switch-Case Switch-case statements can be understood as many if-else statements bundled  together. Because the test expression and target label are known at compile time,  compilers usually construct a jump table to store addresses  ARM  or offsets   Thumb  for each case handler. After determining the index into the jump table,  the compiler indirectly branches to the destination by loading the destination  address into PC. In ARM state, this is normally done by LDR with PC as the  destination and base register. Consider the following example:  01:  ; R1 is the case 02: 0B 00 51 E3   CMP      R1, 0xB   ; is it within range? 03: 01 F1 9F 97   LDRLS    PC, [PC,R1,LSL2] ; yes, switch by                                       ; indexing into the table 04: 14 00 00 EA   B        loc_DD10  ; no, break 05: 3C DD 00 00+  DCD loc_DD3C  ; begin of jump table 06: 4C DD 00 00+  DCD loc_DD4C 07: 68 DD 00 00+  DCD loc_DD68 08: 8C DD 00 00+  DCD loc_DD8C 09: BC DD 00 00+  DCD loc_DDBC 10: F0 DD 00 00+  DCD loc_DDF0 11: 38 DE 00 00+  DCD loc_DE38 12: 38 DE 00 00+  DCD loc_DE38 13: EC DC 00 00+  DCD loc_DCEC  ; case index 8 14: EC DC 00 00+  DCD loc_DCEC  ; case index 9 15: 3C DD 00 00+  DCD loc_DD3C  c02.indd  11:12:43:AM  01 21 2014  Page 65   66   Chapter 2   ARM  16: 3C DD 00 00   DCD loc_DD3C 17:             loc_DCEC   ; handler for case 8,9 18: 00 00 A0 E3   MOV      R0, 0 19: 08 10 41 E2   SUB      R1, R1, 8 20: 04 30 A0 E3   MOV      R3, 4 21: 14 00 82 E5   STR      R0, [R2,0x14] 22: BC 31 C2 E1   STRH     R3, [R2,0x1C] 23: 10 10 82 E5   STR      R1, [R2,0x10]  Line 2 checks whether the case is within range; if not, then it executes the  default handler  line 4 . Line 3 conditionally executes if R1 is within range; it  branches to the case-handler by indexing into the jump table and loads the des- tination address in PC. Recall that PC is 8 bytes after the current instruction  in  ARM state , so the jump table is usually stored 8 bytes from the LDR instruction. In Thumb mode, the same concept applies except that the jump table con- tains offsets instead of addresses. ARM added new instructions to support  table-branching with byte or half-word offsets: TBB and TBH. For TBB, the table  entries are byte values; for TBH, they are half-words. The table entries must be  multiplied by two and added to PC to get the fi nal branch destination. Here is  the preceding example using TBB:  01: 0101E600 0B 29         CMP     R1, 0xB ; is it within range? 02: 0101E602 76 D8         BHI     loc_101E6F2 ; no, break 03: 0101E604 04 26         MOVS    R6, 4 04: 0101E606 DF E8 01 F0   TBB.W   [PC,R1] ; branch using table offset 05: 0101E60A 06          jpt_101E606 DCB 6 ; begin of jump table 06: 0101E60B 09            DCB 9 07: 0101E60C 0F            DCB 0xF 08: 0101E60D 18            DCB 0x18 09: 0101E60E 24            DCB 0x24 10: 0101E60F 32            DCB 0x32 11: 0101E610 45            DCB 0x45 12: 0101E611 45            DCB 0x45 13: 0101E612 6D            DCB 0x6D ; offset for 8 14: 0101E613 6D            DCB 0x6D ; offset for 9 15: 0101E614 06            DCB 6 16: 0101E615 06            DCB 6 17: ... 18: 0101E6E4             loc_101E6E4   ; handler for case 8,9 19: 0101E6E4 B1 F1 08 03   SUBS.W  R3, R1, 8 20: 0101E6E8 00 20         MOVS    R0, 0 21: 0101E6EA 60 61         STR     R0, [R4,0x14]  Because it is in Thumb state, PC is 4 bytes after the current instruction; hence,  for case 8, the table entry would be at address 0x0101E612  =0x0101E60A+8 ,  which is 0x6d, and the handler is at 0x101E6E4  =PC+ 0x6d*2  . Similar to the  previous example, the jump table is usually placed after the TBB TBH instruction.  Note that the TBB TBH are used only in Thumb state.  c02.indd  11:12:43:AM  01 21 2014  Page 66      Miscellaneous  Chapter 2   ARM   67  This section briefl y discusses concepts that are not directly related to the pro- cess of reverse engineering. However, in practice, they are important to know  because they may contribute to your overall knowledge. More knowledge is  always good. You can skip this section on a fi rst read.  Just-in-Time and Self-Modifying Code ARM supports the concept of just-in-time  JIT  and self-modifying code  SMC . JIT  code is native code that is dynamically generated by a JIT compiler; for example,  the Microsoft .NET languages compile to an intermediate language  MSIL  that  is converted into native machine code  x86, x64, ARM, etc.  for execution on the  CPU core. SMC is code that is generated or modifi ed by the current instruction  stream. A common example of SMC is encoded shellcode that is decoded and  executed at run-time. Both JIT and SMC code require writing to memory new  data that is then later fetched by execution.  The ARM core has two separate cache lines for instruction  i-cache  and data   d-cache ; instructions are executed from the i-cache, and memory access is  through the d-cache. These cache lines are not guaranteed to be coherent, which  means that data written to one cache may not be immediately visible to the other.  For example, suppose the i-cache holds four instructions from the instruction  stream and the user generates new or modifi ed instructions at the same spot   which updates the d-cache . Because they are not coherent, the i-cache may not  know about the recent modifi cation, so it executes stale instructions  which may  lead to mysterious crashes or incorrect results . If you are writing JIT systems  or shellcode, this is clearly not a desirable situation. The solution is to explicitly  force the i-cache to be refreshed  also known as fl ushing the cache . On ARM,  this is done by updating a register in the system control coprocessor  CP15 :  01: 4F F0 00 00   MOV.W     R0, 0 02: 07 EE 15 0F   MCR       p15, 0, R0,c7,c5, 0  Most operating systems provide an interface for this operation, so you do  not have to write it yourself. On Linux, use __clear_cache; on Windows, use  FlushInstructionCache.  Synchronization Primitives ARM does not have an instruction similar to cmpxchg  compare-and-exchange   in x86; instead, two instructions are used: LDREX and STREX. These instructions  are just like LDR STR, except that they acquire exclusive access to the memory   c02.indd  11:12:43:AM  01 21 2014  Page 67   68   Chapter 2   ARM  address before loading storing. Together, they are typically used to implement  compare-and-exchange intrinsics. For example: ARM  01: 01 21         MOVS      R1, 1 02:             loc_100C4B0 03: 54 E8 00 2F   LDREX.W   R2, [R4] 04: 1A B9         CBNZ      R2, loc_100C4BE 05: 44 E8 00 13   STREX.W   R3, R1, [R4] ; r3 is the result 06: 00 2B         CMP       R3, 0 07: F8 D1         BNE       loc_100C4B0  Pseudo C  if  InterlockedCompareExchange &r4, 1, 0  == 0  { do stuff; }  Line 3 performs an atomic load into R2 and compares it against 0; if it is zero,  then it is exchanged with zero and the result is returned in R3. This is actually  the implementation of InterlockedCompareExchange in Windows.  From time to time, you will run into code using the DMB, DSB, and ISB instruc- tions. These are barrier instructions that ensure that memory access and  instruction fetches are synchronized before executing subsequent instructions. This  is necessary in some cases because memory access and instructions can be executed  out of order  i.e., the CPU might execute the instructions in a different order than  what appears in the assembly code , and other executing threads may not see the  updated result and consequently have an inconsistent view of the data. For this  reason, you will often see these instructions used in code that implements locks.  System Services and Mechanisms When an ARM core boots up, it starts executing code in the ARM state at the  memory address 0x00000000 or 0xFFFF0000, depending on a setting in copro- cessor 15. This is determined by the vector  V  bit in the system control register   CP15, C1 C0 . If it is 0, then the exception vector is at 0x00000000; otherwise, it  is at 0xFFFF0000. This address is usually in fl ash memory  RAM has not been  initialized yet so it cannot be used , and the content therein is commonly known  as the exception vectors. ARM has a list of predefi ned vectors starting at the base  address. The RESET exception handler is fi rst in the table so it is executed after  a reset event. Because it is the fi rst code to be executed, it usually begins by  performing basic hardware confi guration and starts the boot process. Here is  an exception vector taken from a real device:  01: 00000000 1A 00 00 EA   B  vect_RESET 02: 00000004 12 00 00 EA   B  vect_UNDEFINED_INSTRUCTION  c02.indd  11:12:43:AM  01 21 2014  Page 68      Chapter 2   ARM   69  03: 00000008 12 00 00 EA   B  vect_SUPERVISOR_CALL ;  for SWI SVC  04: 0000000C 12 00 00 EA   B  vect_PREFETCHABORT 05: ... 06: 00000054             vect_UNDEFINED_INSTRUCTION 07: 00000054 FE FF FF EA   B  vect_UNDEFINED_INSTRUCTION 08: 00000058             vect_SUPERVISOR_CALL 09: 00000058 FE FF FF EA   B  vect_SUPERVISOR_CALL 10: 0000005C             vect_PREFETCHABORT 11: 0000005C FE FF FF EA   B  vect_PREFETCHABORT 12: ... 13: 00000070             vect_RESET 14: 00000070 1C F1 9F E5   LDR PC, =0x10000078 15:              ; code has been mapped at 0x10000078 16:              ; begin executing there 17: ... 18: 10000078 18 01 9F E5   LDR R0, =0x2001 19: 1000007C 11 0F 0F EE   MCR p15, 0, R0,c15,c1, 0 20:              ; initializes a vendor-specific register 21: 10000080 00 00 A0 E1   NOP 22: 10000084 00 00 A0 E1   NOP 23: 10000088 00 00 A0 E1   NOP 24: 1000008C 78 00 A0 E3   MOV R0, 0x78 25: 10000090 10 0F 01 EE   MCR p15, 0, R0,c1,c0, 0 26:              ; initializes system control register  After initializing hardware, the reset exception code jumps to a bootloader  that is typically located in fl ash memory, removable media  MMC, SD card, etc. ,  or some other form of storage. Some devices use U-Boot, a popular, open-source  bootloader. The bootloader performs more hardware initialization, reads an  OS image from storage and maps it into main memory, and transfers control  there. After that, the operating system boots up and the system is ready for use. An operating system manages hardware resources and provides services  to users. Because user code  usually in USR mode  runs at a lower privilege  than kernel OS code  usually SVC mode , it has to use an interface to request  service from the OS. In practice, the interface is provided through a software  interrupt or special trap instruction provided by the processor; the service is  commonly implemented as system calls.  For example, on Linux x86, you can  use interrupt 0x80 or the special instruction SYSENTER to issue a system call; on  x64, this is provided by the SYSCALL instruction.  On ARM, there is no dedicated  system-call instruction, so software interrupt is used to implement syscalls.  When a software interrupt happens, the processor switches to supervisor mode  to handle the interrupt. Software interrupts can be triggered by the SWI SVC  instruction.  These instructions are identical except they are named differently.    c02.indd  11:12:43:AM  01 21 2014  Page 69   70   Chapter 2   ARM  Both instructions take an immediate as the parameter—some operating systems  use this parameter as an index into a system call table; and some do not use the  parameter but require the system call number to be in a register  for example,  Windows uses R12 for this purpose . On some Linux systems, the syscall number  is put in R7 and arguments are passed via R0-R2. For example:  Linux  Ubuntu   01: 05 20 A0 E1   MOV    R2, R5    ; 3rd arg 02: 06 10 A0 E1   MOV    R1, R6    ; 2nd arg 03: 09 00 A0 E1   MOV    R0, R9    ; 1st arg 04: 92 70 A0 E3   MOV    R7, 0x92 ; syscall number  05: 00 00 00 EF   SVC    0 ; make the syscall 06: 04 00 70 E3   CMN    R0, 4 ; check return value 07: 00 30 A0 13   MOVNE  R3, 0 ; condition move based on return value  Windows RT  ZwCreateFile  in ntdll  4F F0 53 0C   MOV.W    R12, 0x53 01 DF         SVC      1 70 47         BX       LR           ; End of function ZwCreateFile  SVC transitions to supervisor mode, copies the relevant user registers into  their own space, performs whatever function is requested, and returns when  it is done. How does the SVC know where to return? Normally, it returns to the  instruction after SVC. Before processing the exception, SVC mode copies  the return address to R14_svc, which is a banked register in SVC mode. Banked  registers are those that have meaning only in the context of a particular proces- sor mode. For example, R13_svc and R14_svc are banked registers in SVC mode  so they will have different values than R13–14 in USR mode.  While there is a dedicated instruction for software breakpoint BKPT, there are  a few ways that it can be implemented. The fi rst is through the BKPT instruction,  which triggers the prefetch abort exception handler; the handler can then pass  control to a debugger. Another common method is to trigger the undefi ned  instruction exception handler via an undefi ned instruction. The ARM instruc- tion encoding has a reserved range that is guaranteed to be undefi ned.  Instructions Every instruction in ARM state encodes an arithmetic condition to support  conditional execution. By default, the condition is AL  always execute . This   c02.indd  11:12:43:AM  01 21 2014  Page 70      Chapter 2   ARM   71  condition is encoded in the four most signifi cant bits in the opcode  bits 28–31 ;  AL is defi ned as 0b1110, which is 0xE. If you pay close attention to the assembly  snippets  in ARM state , you will notice that the byte code usually has an 0xE*  pattern at the end. In fact, if you look at the instructions in a hex editor, you will  notice that 0xE* commonly occurs every four bytes. For example:  FE FF FF EA FE FF FF EA FE FF FF EA FE FF FF EA FE FF FF EA 1C F1 9F E5 00 00 A0 E1 18 01 9F E5 11 0F 0F EE 00 00 A0 E1 00 00 A0 E1 00 00 A0 E1 78 00 A0 E3 10 0F 01 EE 00 00 A0 E1 00 00 A0 E1 00 00 A0 E1 00 00 A0 E3 17 0F 08 EE 17 0F 07 EE  Why is it important to know this pattern? Because ARM code is sometimes  embedded in ROM or fl ash memory and may not follow a specifi c fi le for- mat. In your reverse engineering journey, sometimes you will just be given  a raw memory dump without much context, so it can be useful to guess the  architecture by looking at the opcodes. The other reason is related to exploits.  Shellcode can be embedded inside an exploit delivered over the network or in  a document; to analyze it, you must extract the shellcode from the rest of the  network traffi c. Sometimes it is straightforward and the shellcode boundary  is obvious, other times it is not. However, if you can recognize the pattern, you  can quickly guess the start end of code. The ability to recognize instruction  boundaries in a seemingly random blob of data is important. Maybe you will  appreciate it later.  Walk-Through  Having learned all the fundamentals, you can apply them in this section by fully  decompiling an unknown function. This function encompasses many concepts  and techniques covered in this chapter, so it is an excellent way to put your  knowledge to the test. Along the way, you will also learn new skills that were  only hinted at in the early sections. Because the function is somewhat long, we  put it in graph form to save space and improve readability. The function body  is shown in Figure 2-6, and all the code line numbers discussed in this section  refer to this fi gure.

The following list enumer- ates these facts and how you know them:     The code is Thumb state and the instruction set is Thumb-2. You know  this because: 1  prologue and epilogue  lines 1 and 49  use the PUSH POP  pattern; 2  instruction size is either 16 or 32 bits in width; 3  the disas- sembler shows the .W prefi x for some instructions, indicating that they are  using the 32-bit encoding.  c02.indd  11:12:43:AM  01 21 2014  Page 72      Chapter 2   ARM   73     The function preserves R3–R6 and R11. You know this because they are saved  and restored in the prologue  line 1  and epilogue  line 49 , respectively.    The function takes at most four arguments  R0–R3  and returns a Boolean   R0 . You know this because according to the ARM ABI  Application  Binary Interface , the fi rst four parameters are passed in R0–R3  the rest are  pushed on the stack  and the return value is in R0.  It is “at most four” in  this case because you saw that before calling the function in line 5, R0–R3  are initialized with some values and you do not see any other instructions  writing to the stack  for additional arguments . At this point, the function  prototype is as follows:  BOOL unk_function int, int, int, int      The fi rst two arguments’ type is “pointer to an object.” You know this  because R0 and R1 are the base address in a load instruction  lines 10–11 .   The types are most likely structures because there is access to offset 0x10,  0x18, 0x1c, and so on  line 10, 11, 19, 22, 24, 28, etc. . You can be nearly  certain that they are not arrays because the access load pattern is not  sequential. It is uncertain whether R0 and R1 are pointers to one or two  different structure types without further context. For now, you can assume  that they are two different types. You update the prototype as follows: BOOL unk_function struct1 *, struct2 *, int, int      loc_103C4BA is the exit path to return 0; loc_103C4FA is the exit path to  return 1; and locret_103C4FC returns from the function. Hence, branches  to these locations indicate that you are done with the function.     The third and fourth arguments are of type integer. You know this because  R2 and R3 are being used in AND ORR operations  lines 23, 25, and 26 . While  there is indeed a possibility that they can be pointers, it is unlikely to be  the case unless they were encoding decoding pointers; and even if they  were pointers, you should see them being used in load store operations  but you don’t.     Even though R11 is adjusted to be 0x10 bytes above the stack pointer, it   is never used after that instruction. Hence, it can be ignored.     The function foo  line 35  takes one argument. Its entire body is not included  here due to space constraints. Just assume this is a given for the sake of  simplicity.  Having enumerated known facts, you now need to use them to logically derive  other useful facts. The next important task is to delve into the two unknown  structures identifi ed. Obviously you cannot recover its entire layout because  only some of its elements are referenced in the function; however, you can still  infer the fi eld type information.  R0 is of type struct1 *. In line 10, it loads a fi eld member at offset 0x8 and then  compares it with R4  line 13 . R4 is a fi eld member at offset 0x18 in the structure  struct2  R1 . Because they are being compared to each other, you know that they   c02.indd  11:12:43:AM  01 21 2014  Page 73   74   Chapter 2   ARM  are of the same type. Line 13 compares these two fi elds. If they are equal, then  execution proceeds to loc_103C4BE; otherwise, 0 is returned  line 15 . Because  of the equality compare, you can infer that these two fi elds are integers.  Line 19 loads another fi eld member from struct1 and compares it against 2;  if it is not equal, then 0 is returned  line 21 . You can infer that the fi eld type is  a short because of the LDRH instruction  loads a half-word .  Lines 22–23 load another fi eld member from struct1 and ANDs it against the  third argument  which is assumed to be an integer . Lines 25–27 do something  similar with the fourth argument. Because of these operations, you can infer  that fi eld members at offset 0x18 and 0x1c are integers.  The structure defi nitions so far are as follows: struct1 ...    +0x008 field08_i ; same type as struct2.field18_i ...    +0x010 field10_s ; short ...    +0x018 field18_i ; int    +0x01c field1c_i ; int  struct2 ...    +0x018 field18_i ; same type as struct1.field08_i  N O T E  For struct ﬁ eld names, you might follow the habit of indicating the oﬀ set and  the “type.” For example, an “I” suﬃ  x means integer  or some generic 32-bit type , “s”  means short  16-bit , “c” means char  1 byte , and “p” means pointer of some type. This  enables you to quickly remember what their types are. When you determine their true  purpose, you can then rename them to something more meaningful.  Given these types, you can already recover the pseudo-code of everything   from line 1 to 27. It is as follows:  struct1 *arg1 = ...; struct1 *arg2 = ...; int arg3 = ...; int arg4 = ...;  BOOL result = unk_function arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4 ; if  arg1->field08_i == arg2->field18_i  {   if  arg1->field10_s != 2  return 0;   if     arg1->field18_i & arg3            arg1->field1c_i & arg4           != 0        return 0;  ... } else {  c02.indd  11:12:43:AM  01 21 2014  Page 74        return 0; }  Chapter 2   ARM   75  It is a bit suspicious that the AND operation is being used on two adjacent   N O T E  integer ﬁ elds. This usually means that they are actually 64-bit integers split into two  registers memory locations. This is a common pattern used to access 64-bit constants  on 32-bit architectures.  Astute readers will notice that lines 25–27 may seem a bit redundant. ANDS sets  the condition fl ags, ORRS immediately overwrites it, and BNE takes the fl ag from  ORRS; hence, the conditions set by ANDS are really not necessary. The compiler  generates this redundancy because it is optimizing for code density: AND will  be 4 bytes long, but ANDS is only 2 bytes. MOV and MOVS are also subjected to the  same optimization. You will often see this pattern in code optimized for Thumb. Line 28 loads another fi eld from struct1 into R3; line 29 loads from offset  zero of the same structure into R0; and line 30 sets R2 to R3*3  =R3+ R3<<1  .  Line 31 loads a fi eld from struct2 into R3 and then accesses another fi eld using  that as a base pointer. This implies that you have a pointer to another structure  inside struct2 at offset 0xC. Line 32 loads a fi eld from that new structure into  R3; line 33 updates it to be R3+R2*8; and line 34 uses that as a base address and  loads a signed short value at offset 0x16 of another structure into R4.   Let’s update the structure defi nition before continuing:  struct1    +0x000 field00_i ; int ...    +0x008 field08_i ; same type as struct2.field18_i    +0x00c field0c_i ; integer ...    +0x010 field10_s ; short ...    +0x018 field18_i ; int    +0x01c field1c_i ; int ...  struct2 ...    +0x00c field0c_p ; struct3 * ...    +0x018 field18_i ; same type as struct1.field08_i ...  struct3 ...    +0x00c field0c_p ; struct4 * ...  struct4  size=0x18=24     why?  c02.indd  11:12:43:AM  01 21 2014  Page 75   76   Chapter 2   ARM  ...    +0x016 field16_c; char    +0x017 end  You could deduce that there was an array involved because of the multiplica- tion scaling factor  lines 30 and 33 ; there were not two arrays because R2–R3  in line 30 is not a base address but an index. Also, it does not make sense for a  base address to be multiplied by 3. The base address of the array is R3 in line  33 because it is being indexed with R2. You inferred that each array element  must be 0x18  24  because after simplifi cation, it was R2*3*8, where R2 is the  index and 24 is the scale.  Figure 2-7 illustrates the relationships between the four structures.  struct1 +00 ﬁeld00_i … +08 ﬁeld08_i +0c ﬁeld0c_i … +10 ﬁeld10_a … +18 ﬁeld18_i +1c ﬁeld1c_a …  Figure 2-7  struct2 … +0c ﬁeld0c_p … +18 ﬁeld18_i … +10 ﬁeld10_a …  struct3 … +0c ﬁeld0c_p …  struct4 … +16 ﬁeld16_c +17 ﬁeld17_c  0×18 bytes  = i  struct4  [0]  [1]  [2]  [3]  [i−1]  struct4  …  Here is the pseudo-code for lines 28–35: r3 = arg1->field0c_i; r2 = r3 + r3<<1    = arg1->field0c_i*3; r3 = arg2->field0c_p; r3 = arg2->field0c_p->field0c_p; r3 = arg2->field0c_p->field0c_p + r2*8    = arg2->field0c_p->field0c_p + arg1->field0c_i*24;    = arg2->field0c_p->field0c_p[arg1->field0c_i]; r4 = arg2->field0c_p->field0c_p[arg1->field0c_i].field16_c; r0 = foo arg1->field00_i ;  The rest of the function is simply comparing the return value from foo and   r4. The full pseudo-code now looks like this:  struct1 *arg1 = ...; struct2 *arg2 = ...;  c02.indd  11:12:43:AM  01 21 2014  Page 76      int arg3 = ...; int arg4 = ...;  Chapter 2   ARM   77  BOOL result = unk_function arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4 ;  BOOL unk_function struct1 *arg1, struct2 *arg2, int arg3, int arg4  {   char a;   int b;   if  arg1->field08_i == arg2->field18_i  {     if  arg1->field10_s != 2  return 0;     if     arg1->field18_i & arg3              arg1->field1c_i & arg4             != 0          return 0;      b = foo arg1->field00_i ;     a = arg2->field0c_p->field0c_p[arg1->field0c_i].field16_c;     if  b == 0x61 && a != 0x61  {       return 0;     } else { return 1;}     if  b == 0x62 && a >= 0x63  {       return 1;     } else { return 0;}   } else {    return 0;   } }  While this function used multiple, interconnected data structures whose full  layout is unclear, you can see how you were still able to recover some of the fi eld  types and their relationship with others. You also learned how to recognize a  type’s width and signedness by considering the instruction and conditional  code associated with them.  Next Steps  This chapter provided the fundamental skills required to statically reverse engi- neer ARM code. We intentionally avoided writing an instruction manual and  left out many details; to improve your skills, you will need to do the exercises,  practice, and read the ARM manuals  these activities go together . The technical  reference manual can be somewhat dense, but the knowledge acquired from  this chapter will make it much easier to understand.  Your next step should be to buy an ARM device and experiment with it. There  are many ARM devices to choose from, but perhaps the two most conducive  to learning are the BeagleBoard and the PandaBoard. These are development  boards intended to introduce people to embedded development on the ARM   c02.indd  11:12:43:AM  01 21 2014  Page 77   78   Chapter 2   ARM  platform; they are relatively powerful, cheap  $150–$170 , well-documented,  and have a large user community.  You may not run into many people who  understand ARM assembly, but that’s okay because you already read this chap- ter. The areas for which you may need help are usually related to the onboard  peripherals and how they are programmed controlled.  You can install Linux  with a full development environment on these boards, so it is very simple to  test your knowledge of ARM.  Exercises  The exercises are included to ensure that you have a good understanding of the  concepts and to raise your motivation. Some of the exercises were intentionally  selected to include instructions that were not covered in the chapter so that  you get used to reading the manual  a very important habit ; calling context is  also omitted to make you think more. Every function is self-contained to facili- tate complete decompilation; some are selected such that you can verify your  answer if you have done enough of them. It is recommended that you write  comments and notes, and draw connections between branches labels, on the  exercise themselves.  For the code in each exercise, do the following in order  whenever possible :    Determine whether it is in Thumb or ARM state.    Explain each instruction’s semantic. If the instruction is LDR STR, explain   the addressing mode as well.     Identify the types  width and signedness  for every possible object. For  structures, recover fi eld size, type, and friendly name whenever possible.   Not all structure fi elds will be recoverable because the function may only  access a few fi elds. For each type recovered, explain to yourself  or some- one else  how you inferred it.     Recover the function prototype.    Identify the function prologue and epilogue.    Explain what the function does and then write pseudo-code for it.    Decompile the function back to C and give it a meaningful name.    1.  Figure 2-8 shows a function that takes two arguments. It may seem some- what challenging at fi rst, but its functionality is very common.  Have  patience.    2.  Figure 2-9 shows a function that was found in the export table.  c02.indd  11:12:43:AM  01 21 2014  Page 78      Chapter 2   ARM   79    3.

Figure 2-10 shows another easy function.   5.  Figure 2-11 is simple as well. The actual string names have been removed   so you cannot cheat by searching the Internet.    6.  Figure 2-12 involves some twiddling.   7.  Figure 2-13 illustrates a common routine, but you may not have seen it     8.  In Figure 2-14, byteArray is a 256-character array whose content is byte-  implemented this way.  Array[] = {0, 1, …, 0xff}.    9.  What does the function shown in Figure 2-15 do?   10.

Because  drivers interact with the OS through well-defi ned interfaces, the analytical task  can be decomposed into the following general objectives:     Understand how core OS components are implemented    Understand the structure of a driver    Understand the user-driver and driver-OS interfaces and how Windows   implements them  binary form     Understand how certain driver software constructs are manifested in      Systematically apply knowledge from the previous steps in the general   reverse engineering process  87  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 87   88   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel  If the process of reverse engineering Windows drivers could be modeled as a  discrete task, 90% would be understanding how Windows works and 10% would  be understanding assembly code. Hence, the chapter is written as an introduction  to the Windows kernel for reverse engineers. It begins with a discussion of the  user-kernel interfaces and their implementation. Next, it discusses linked lists  and how they are used in Windows. Then it explains concepts such as threads,  processes, memory, interrupts, and how they are used in the kernel and drivers.  After that it goes into the architecture of a kernel-mode driver and the driver- kernel programming interface. It concludes by applying these concepts to the  reverse engineering of a rootkit.  Unless specifi ed otherwise, every example in this chapter is taken from   Windows 8 RTM.  Windows Fundamentals  We begin with a discussion of core Windows kernel concepts, including fun- damental data structures and kernel objects relevant to driver programming  and reverse engineering.  Memory Layout Like many operating systems, Windows divides the virtual address space  into two portions: kernel and user space. On x86 and ARM, the upper 2GB is  reserved for the kernel and the bottom 2GB is for user processes. Hence, virtual  addresses from 0 to 0x7fffffff are in user space, 0x80000000 and above are in  kernel space. On x64, the same concept applies except that user space is from 0  to 0x000007ff`ffffffff and kernel space is 0xffff0800`00000000 and above.  Figure 3-1 illustrates the general layout on x86 and x64. The kernel memory space  is mostly the same in all processes. However, running processes only have access  to their user address space; kernel-mode code can access both.  Some kernel  address ranges, such as those in session and hyper space, vary from process to  process.  This is an important fact to keep in mind because we will come back  to it later when discussing execution context. Kernel- and user-mode pages are  distinguished by a special bit in their page table entry.  When a thread in a process is scheduled for execution, the OS changes a  processor-specifi c register to point to the page directory for that particular  process. This is so that all virtual-to-physical address translations are specifi c  to the process and not others. This is how the OS can have multiple processes  and each one has the illusion that it owns the entire user-mode address space.  On x86 and x64 architectures, the page directory base register is CR3; on ARM  it is the translation table base register  TTBR .  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 88      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   89  0xffffffff'ffffffff  0xffff0800'00000000 0x000007ff'fffeffff  0x00000000'00000000  kernel  user  x64  0xffffffff  0x80000000  0x7ffeffff  0x00000000  Figure 3-1  kernel  user  x86  The user kernel address ranges are stored in two symbols in the kernel:   N O T E  It is possible to change this default behavior by specifying the  3GB switch in  the boot options. With  3GB, the user address space increases to 3GB and the remain- ing 1GB is for the kernel.   MmSystemRangeStart  kernel  and MmHighestUserAddress  user . These  symbols can be viewed with a kernel debugger. You may notice that there is a 64KB  gap between user kernel space on x86 ARM. This region, usually referred to as the  no-access  region, is there so that the kernel does not accidentally cross the address  boundary and corrupt user-mode memory. On x64, the astute reader may notice that  0xffff0800`00000000 is a non-canonical address and hence unusable by the  operating system. This address is really only used as a separator between user kernel  space. The ﬁ rst usable address in kernel space starts at 0xffff8000`00000000.  Processor Initialization When the kernel boots up, it performs some basic initialization for each proces- sor. Most of the initialization details are not vital for daily reverse engineering  tasks, but it is important to know a few of the core structures.  The processor control region  PCR  is a per-processor structure that stores critical  CPU information and state. For example, on x86 it contains the base address of  the IDT and current IRQL. Inside the PCR is another data structure called the  processor region control block  PRCB . It is a per-processor structure that contains  information about the processor—i.e., CPU type, model, speed, current thread   c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 89   90   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel  that it is running, next thread to run, queue of DPCs to run, and so on. Like  the PCR, this structure is undocumented, but you can still view its defi nition  with the kernel debugger: x64  x86 is similar  PCR  0: kd> dt nt!_KPCR    +0x000 NtTib            : _NT_TIB    +0x000 GdtBase          : Ptr64 _KGDTENTRY64    +0x008 TssBase          : Ptr64 _KTSS64    +0x010 UserRsp          : Uint8B    +0x018 Self             : Ptr64 _KPCR    +0x020 CurrentPrcb      : Ptr64 _KPRCB ...    +0x180 Prcb             : _KPRCB  PRCB  0: kd> dt nt!_KPRCB    +0x000 MxCsr            : Uint4B    +0x004 LegacyNumber     : UChar    +0x005 ReservedMustBeZero : UChar    +0x006 InterruptRequest : UChar    +0x007 IdleHalt         : UChar    +0x008 CurrentThread    : Ptr64 _KTHREAD    +0x010 NextThread       : Ptr64 _KTHREAD    +0x018 IdleThread       : Ptr64 _KTHREAD  ...       +0x040 ProcessorState   : _KPROCESSOR_STATE    +0x5f0 CpuType          : Char    +0x5f1 CpuID            : Char    +0x5f2 CpuStep          : Uint2B    +0x5f2 CpuStepping      : UChar    +0x5f3 CpuModel         : UChar    +0x5f4 MHz              : Uint4B ...    +0x2d80 DpcData          : [2] _KDPC_DATA    +0x2dc0 DpcStack         : Ptr64 Void    +0x2dc8 MaximumDpcQueueDepth : Int4B ...

The PCR for a current processor is always accessible from kernel-mode through  special registers. It is stored in the FS segment  x86 , GS segment  x64 , or one of  the system coprocessor registers  ARM . For example, the Windows kernel exports  two routines to get the current EPROCESS and ETHREAD: PsGetCurrentProcess  and PsGetCurrentThread. These routines work by querying the PCR PRCB:  PsGetCurrentThread proc near   mov     rax, gs:188h   ; gs:[0] is the PCR, offset 0x180 is the PRCB,                          ; offset 0x8 into the PRCB is the CurrentThread  field   retn PsGetCurrentThread endp  PsGetCurrentProcess proc near   mov     rax, gs:188h    ; get current thread  see above    mov     rax, [rax+0B8h] ; offset 0x70 into the ETHREAD is the associated                           ; process actually ETHREAD.ApcState.Process    retn PsGetCurrentProcess endp  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 91   92   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel  System Calls An operating system manages hardware resources and provides interfaces  through which users can request them. The most commonly used interface is the  system call. A system call is typically a function in the kernel that services I O  requests from users; it is implemented in the kernel because only high-privilege  code can manage such resources. For example, when a word processor saves a  fi le to disk, it fi rst needs to request a fi le handle from the kernel, writes to the  fi le, and then commits the fi le content to the hard disk; the OS provides system  calls to acquire a fi le handle and write bytes to it. While these appear to be  simple operations, the system calls must perform many important tasks in the  kernel to service the request. For example, to get a fi le handle, it must interact  with the fi le system  to determine whether the path is valid or not  and then  ask the security manager to determine whether the user has suffi cient rights  to access the fi le; to write bytes to the fi le, the kernel needs to fi gure out which  hard drive volume the fi le is on, send the request to the volume, and package  the data into a structure understood by the underlying hard-drive controller.  All these operations are done with complete transparency to the user.  The Windows system call implementation details are offi cially undocumented,  so it is worth exploring for intellectual and pedagogical reasons. While the  implementation varies between processors, the concepts remain the same. We  will fi rst explain the concepts and then discuss the implementation details on  x86, x64, and ARM.  Windows describes and stores system call information with two data struc- tures: a service table descriptor and an array of function pointers offsets. The  service table descriptor is a structure that holds metadata about system calls  supported by the OS; its defi nition is offi cially undocumented, but many people  have reverse engineered its important fi eld members as follows.  You can also  fi gure out these fi elds by analyzing the KiSystemCall64 or KiSystemService  routines.   typedef struct _KSERVICE_TABLE_DESCRIPTOR {   PULONG Base;    array of addresses or offsets   PULONG Count;   ULONG Limit;    size of the array   PUCHAR Number;   ... } KSERVICE_TABLE_DESCRIPTOR, *PKSERVICE_TABLE_DESCRIPTOR;  Base is a pointer to an array of function pointers or offsets  depending on the  processor ; a system call number is an index into this array. Limit is the number of  entries in the array. The kernel keeps two global arrays of KSERVICE_DESCRIPTOR_ DESCRIPTOR: KeServiceDescriptorTable and KeServiceDescriptorTableShadow.  The former contains the native syscall table; the latter contains the same data, in  addition to the syscall table for GUI threads. The kernel also keeps two global   c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 92      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   93  pointers to the arrays of addresses offsets: KiServiceTable points to the non-GUI  syscall table and W32pServiceTable points to the GUI one. Figure 3-2 illustrates  how these data structures are related to each other on x86.

The offset is  contained in the top 20 bits, and the number of arguments on the stack is con- tained in the bottom 4 bits. The offset is added to the base of KiServiceTable  to get the real address of the syscall. For example:  0: kd> dps nt!KeServiceDescriptorTable fffff803`955cd900  fffff803`952ed200 nt!KiServiceTable   ; Base fffff803`955cd908  00000000`00000000 fffff803`955cd910  00000000`000001ad fffff803`955cd918  fffff803`952edf6c nt!KiArgumentTable 0: kd> u ntdll!NtCreateFile ntdll!NtCreateFile: 000007f8`34f23130 mov     r10,rcx 000007f8`34f23133 mov     eax,53h ; syscall number 000007f8`34f23138 syscall ... 0: kd> x nt!KiServiceTable fffff803`952ed200 nt!KiServiceTable     0: kd> dd nt!KiServiceTable +  0x53*4  L1 fffff803`952ed34c  03ea2c07       ; encoded offset and number of arguments 0: kd> u nt!KiServiceTable +  0x03ea2c07>>4  ; get the offset and add it to  Base nt!NtCreateFile: fffff803`956d74c0 sub     rsp,88h fffff803`956d74c7 xor     eax,eax fffff803`956d74c9 mov     qword ptr [rsp+78h],rax fffff803`956d74ce mov     dword ptr [rsp+70h],20h 0: kd> ? 0x03ea2c07 & 0xf         ; number of arguments Evaluate expression: 7 = 00000000`00000007 ; NtCreateFile takes 11 arguments. The first 4 are passed via registers and ; the last 7 are passed on the stack  As demonstrated, every system call is identifi ed by a number that is an index  into KiServiceTable or W32pServiceTable. At the lowest level, user-mode APIs  decompose to one or more system calls.   Conceptually, this is how system calls work on Windows. The implementation  details vary depending on processor architecture and platform. System calls  are typically implemented through software interrupts or architecture-specifi c  instructions, the details of which are covered in the following sections.  Faults, Traps, and Interrupts  In preparation for the next sections, we need to introduce some basic terminol- ogy to explain how peripheral devices and software interact with the processor.  In contemporary computing systems, the processor is typically connected to   c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 94      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   95  peripheral devices through a data bus such as PCI Express, FireWire, or USB.  When a device requires the processor’s attention, it causes an interrupt that forces  the processor to pause whatever it is doing and handle the device’s request.  How does the processor know how to handle the request? At the highest level,  one can think of an interrupt as being associated with a number that is then  used to index into an array of function pointers. When the processor receives  the interrupt, it executes the function at the index associated with the request  and resumes execution wherever it was before the interrupt occurred. These  are called hardware interrupts because they are generated by hardware devices.  They are asynchronous by nature.  When the processor is executing an instruction, it may run into exceptions.  For example, the instruction causes a divide-by-zero error, references an invalid  address, or triggers privilege-level transition. For the purpose of this discussion,  exceptions can be classifi ed into two categories: faults and traps. A fault is a cor- rectable exception. For example, when the processor executes an instruction that  references a valid memory address but the data is not present in main memory   it was paged out , a page fault exception is generated. The processor handles this  by saving the current execution state, calls the page fault handler to correct this  exception  by paging in the data , and re-executes the same instruction  which  should no longer cause a page fault . A trap is an exception caused by execut- ing special kinds of instructions. For example, on x64, the instruction SYSCALL  causes the processor to begin executing at an address specifi ed by an MSR;  after the handler is done, execution is resumed at the instruction immediately  after SYSCALL. Hence, the major difference between a fault and a trap is where  execution resumes. System calls are commonly implemented through special  exceptions or trap instructions.  Interrupts The Intel architecture defi nes an interrupt descriptor table  IDT  with 256 entries;  each entry is a structure with information defi ning the interrupt handler. The  base address of the IDT is stored in a special register called IDTR. An interrupt is  associated with an index into this table. There are predefi ned interrupts reserved  by the architecture. For example, 0x0 is for division exception, 0x3 is for soft- ware breakpoint, and 0xe is for page faults. Interrupts 32–255 are user-defi ned. On x86, each entry in the IDT table is an 8-byte structure defi ned as follows:  1: kd> dt nt!_KIDTENTRY    +0x000 Offset           : Uint2B    +0x002 Selector         : Uint2B    +0x004 Access           : Uint2B    +0x006 ExtendedOffset   : Uint2B   On x64, the IDT entry structure is mostly the same except that the interrupt  handler’s address is divided into three members. You can see it by dumping   c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 95   96   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel  the nt!_KIDTENTRY64 structure. Also note that the IDTR is 48 bits in width and  divided into two parts: IDT base address and limit. WinDBG displays only the  base address.   The interrupt handler’s address is split between the Offset and ExtendedOffset  fi elds. Here is an example decoding the IDT and disassembling the divide-by- zero interrupt handler  0x0 :  1: kd> r @idtr idtr=8b409d50 1: kd> dt nt!_KIDTENTRY 8b409d50    +0x000 Offset           : 0xa284    +0x002 Selector         : 8    +0x004 Access           : 0x8e00    +0x006 ExtendedOffset   : 0x813c 1: kd> u 0x813ca284 nt!KiTrap00: 813ca284 push    0 813ca286 mov     word ptr [esp+2],0 813ca28d push    ebp 813ca28e push    ebx  Figure 3-3 illustrates the IDT on x86.  0 1 2 3 . ff  _KIDT_ENTRY _KIDT_ENTRY _KIDT_ENTRY _KIDT_ENTRY  …  _KIDT_ENTRY  nt!KiTrap00 push 0 mov  word ptr [esp+2],0 push ebp push ebx ...  nt!KiTrap03 push 0 mov  word ptr [esp+2],0 push ebp push ebx ...  nt!KiUnexpectedInterrupt207 push    0FFh jmp     nt!KiEndUnexpectedRange nt!KiEndUnexpectedRange: jmp     dword ptr cs:[nt!KiEndUnexpectedRange+0x7] xchg    eax,edi pushfd mov     byte ptr [edx+7510F983h],al cmp     eax,25E85352h ...  Figure 3-3  On pre-Pentium 2 processors, Windows uses interrupt 0x2e to implement  system calls. User-mode programs call APIs in kernel32.dll  or kernelbase.dll ,   c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 96      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   97  which eventually resolve to short stubs in ntdll.dll that trigger interrupt 0x2e.  To illustrate, consider the following snippet from the kernelbase!CreateFileW  API routine on Windows 7:  [inside kernelbase!CreateFileW] ... .text:0DCE9C87 mov ecx, [ebp+dwFlagsAndAttributes] .text:0DCE9C8A push [ebp+lpSecurityAttributes] .text:0DCE9C8D mov eax, [ebp+dwDesiredAccess] .text:0DCE9C90 push [ebp+lpFileName] .text:0DCE9C93 mov esi, ds:__imp__NtCreateFile@44 .text:0DCE9C99 push [ebp+var_4] .text:0DCE9C9C and ecx, 7FA7h .text:0DCE9CA2 push [ebp+dwShareMode] .text:0DCE9CA5 mov [ebp+dwFlagsAndAttributes], ecx .text:0DCE9CA8 push ecx .text:0DCE9CA9 push ebx .text:0DCE9CAA lea ecx, [ebp+var_20] .text:0DCE9CAD push ecx .text:0DCE9CAE or eax, 100080h .text:0DCE9CB3 lea ecx, [ebp+var_64] .text:0DCE9CB6 push ecx .text:0DCE9CB7 push eax .text:0DCE9CB8 mov [ebp+dwDesiredAccess], eax .text:0DCE9CBB lea eax, [ebp+var_8] .text:0DCE9CBE push eax .text:0DCE9CBF call esi ; NtCreateFile ...   It does some preliminary validation  not shown here  and then calls   ntdll!NtCreateFile. The implementation for that is as follows:  [ntdll!NtCreateFile] .text:77F04A10 _NtCreateFile@44 proc near .text:77F04A10 mov eax, 42h ; syscall  .text:77F04A15 mov edx, 7FFE0300h ; KUSER_SHARED_DATA.SystemCall ; the symbol for 0x7ffe0300 is SharedUserData!SystemCallStub .text:77F04A1A call dword ptr [edx] ; call handler .text:77F04A1C retn 2Ch ; return back to caller .text:77F04A1C _NtCreateFile@44 endp  NtCreateFile sets EAX to 0x42 because that’s the system call number for  NtCreateFile in the kernel. Next, it reads a pointer at 0x7ffe0300 and calls it.  What is special about 0x7ffe0300? On all architectures, there is a per-process  structure called KUSER_SHARED_DATA that is always mapped at 0x7ffe0000.

The details of the system call dispatcher are covered in the next section.  Traps The previous section explains how system calls are implemented with the  built-in interrupt processing mechanism. This section explains how they are  implemented through trap instructions on x64, x86, and ARM.  Beginning with the implementation on x64, consider the system call stub   ntdll!NtCreateFile:  01: .text:00000001800030F0   public ZwCreateFile 02: .text:00000001800030F0 ZwCreateFile proc near 03: .text:00000001800030F0   mov     r10, rcx     04: .text:00000001800030F3   mov     eax, 53h 05: .text:00000001800030F8   syscall 06: .text:00000001800030FA   retn 07: .text:00000001800030FA ZwCreateFile endp  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 98      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   99  Line 3 saves the fi rst argument to R10; it has to do this because SYSCALL’s  semantic dictates that the return address  line 6  must be stored in RCX. Line 4  saves the system call number in EAX; once SYSCALL transitions to kernel mode, it  will use this as an index into the KiServiceTable array. Line 5 executes SYSCALL  which transitions to kernel mode. How does it do this? The documentation for  SYSCALL specifi es that RIP will be loaded with a value defi ned by the IA32_LSTAR  MSR  0xc0000082 , and you can observe it in the debugger:  1: kd> rdmsr 0xC0000082 msr[c0000082] = fffff800`89e96dc0 1: kd> u fffff800`89e96dc0 nt!KiSystemCall64: fffff800`89e96dc0 swapgs fffff800`89e96dc3 mov     qword ptr gs:[10h],rsp fffff800`89e96dcc mov     rsp,qword ptr gs:[1A8h] fffff800`89e96dd5 push    2Bh fffff800`89e96dd7 push    qword ptr gs:[10h] fffff800`89e96ddf push    r11  This kernel debugger output indicates that SYSCALL will always end up execut- ing KiSystemCall64 in the kernel. In fact, KiSystemCall64 is the main system call  dispatcher in x64 Windows. Windows sets the IA32 LSTAR MSR to KiSystemCall64  early in the processor initialization process  see KiInitializeBootStructures .  It is primarily responsible for saving the user-mode context, setting up a kernel  stack, copying the user-mode arguments to the kernel stack, determining the  system call in KiServiceTable  or W32pServiceTable  using the index passed  in from EAX, invoking the system call, and returning to user mode. How does  the syscall dispatcher know where to return in user mode? Recall that SYSCALL  saves the return address in RCX. After the system call fi nishes its work and  returns, the system call dispatcher uses the SYSRET instruction, which sets RIP  to RCX so it goes back to user mode.  While KiSystemCall64 supports many functionalities  syscall profi ling, user- mode scheduling, debugging, etc. , its primary responsibility is to dispatch  system call requests. In the previous section, we stated that each value in the  KiServiceTable array encodes an offset to the system call and the number of  arguments passed on the stack. This can be observed in the following code  snippet from KiSystemCall64:  01: KiSystemCall64 proc near 02:  03: var_110= byte ptr -110h 04:  05:   swapgs 06:   mov     gs:10h, rsp    ; KPCR->UserRsp 07:   mov     rsp, gs:1A8h   ; KPCR->KPRCB->RspBase 08:                          ; setup a new kernel stack  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 99   100   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel  09:   push    2Bh 10:   push    qword ptr gs:10h ; KPCR->UserRsp 11:   push    r11 12:  13:   sti                      ; enable interrupts 14:   mov     [rbx+88h], rcx   ; KTHREAD->FirstArgument 15:   mov     [rbx+80h], eax   ; KTHREAD->SystemCallNumber 16: KiSystemServiceStart proc near   17:   mov     [rbx+90h], rsp   ; KTHREAD->TrapFrame 18:   mov     edi, eax         ; eax = syscall  19:   shr     edi, 7           ; determine which syscall table 20:   and     edi, 20h 21:   and     eax, 0FFFh     ; index into table  recall 64bit syscall  encoding  22: KiSystemServiceRepeat proc near 23:   lea     r10, KeServiceDescriptorTable 24:   lea     r11, KeServiceDescriptorTableShadow 25:   test    dword ptr [rbx+78h], 40h ; determines if it is a GUI thread 26:   cmovnz  r10, r11         ; which table to use? 27:   cmp     eax, [rdi+r10+10h] ; is that syscall table within the table  Limit? 28:                              ; i.e., KSERVICE_TABLE_DESCRIPTOR.Limit 29:   jnb     case_invalidcallnumber 30:   mov     r10, [rdi+r10]     ; select the right table 31:   movsxd  r11, dword ptr [r10+rax*4] ; get the syscall offset 32:   mov     rax, r11 33:   sar     r11, 4 34:   add     r10, r11   ; add it to the base of the table to get syscall VA 35:   cmp     edi, 20h   ; edi determines which table. here it is used to                          ; determined if it is a GUI 36:   jnz     short case_nonguirequest 37:   mov     r11, [rbx+0F0h] 38:  39: KiSystemServiceCopyEnd proc near 40:   test    cs:dword_140356088, 40h 41:   jnz     case_loggingenabled 42:   call    r10        ; invoke the system call  Walking through KiSystemCall64 can be an instructional experience and is   left as an exercise.  On x86, Windows uses the SYSENTER instruction to implement system calls.  The mechanics is similar to that of SYSCALL on x64 processors. Before going  into the implementation, let’s look at the system call stub for ntdll!NtQuery InformationProcess:  01: _ZwQueryInformationProcess@20 proc near 02:   mov     eax, 0B0h          ; system call number 03:   call    sub_6A214FCD       ; stub 04:   retn    14h    ; clean stack and return. NtQueryInformationProcess  takes 05:                  ; 5 parameters and they are passed on the stack                                  ; SYSENTER will return here  see next  example   c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 100      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   101  ntdll!NtCreateFile sets the system call number and calls another routine  that saves the stack pointer in EDX, followed by the SYSENTER instruction. Intel  documentation states that SYSENTER sets EIP to the value stored in MSR 0x176:  06: _ZwQueryInformationProcess@20 endp 07:  08: sub_6A214FCD proc near 09:   mov     edx, esp 10:   sysenter 11:   retn 12: sub_6A214FCD endp  0: kd> rdmsr 0x176 msr[176] = 00000000`80f7d1d0 0: kd> u 00000000`80f7d1d0 nt!KiFastCallEntry: 80f7d1d0 mov     ecx,23h 80f7d1d5 push    30h 80f7d1d7 pop     fs 80f7d1d9 mov     ds,cx 80f7d1db mov     es,cx 80f7d1dd mov     ecx,dword ptr fs:[40h]  The debugger output shows that when the instruction SYSENTER executes, it tran- sitions to kernel mode and starts executing KiFastCallEntry. KiFastCallEntry  is the main system call dispatcher on x86 Windows using SYSENTER  think of it  like KiSystemCall64 on x64 . One peculiar characteristic of SYSENTER is that it  does not save the return address in a register as SYSCALL does. Once the system  call is complete, how does the kernel know where to return? The answer consists  of two parts. Using NtQueryInformationProcess again as an example, before  calling SYSENTER to enter kernel mode, fi rst the sequence of calls looks like this:      kernel32!GetLogicalDrives -> ntdll!NtQueryInformationProcess ->                              stub -> SYSENTER  This means that the return address is already set up on the stack before SYSENTER  is executed. Immediately before SYSENTER, KiFastSystemCall saves the stack  pointer in EDX. Second, after SYSENTER, the code transitions to KiFastCallEntry,  which saves this stack pointer. Once the system call is complete, the syscall dis- patcher executes the SYSEXIT instruction. By defi nition, SYSEXIT sets EIP to EDX,  and ESP to ECX; in practice, the kernel sets EDX to ntdll!KiSystemCallRet and  ECX to the stack pointer before entering the kernel. You can observe this in action  by setting a breakpoint at the SYSEXIT instruction inside KiSystemCallExit2  and then viewing the stack from there:  1: kd> r eax=00000000 ebx=00000000 ecx=029af304 edx=77586954 esi=029af3c0 edi=029afa04 eip=815d0458 esp=a08f7c8c ebp=029af3a8 iopl=0         nv up ei ng nz na pe cy cs=0008  ss=0010  ds=0023  es=0023  fs=0030  gs=0000             efl=00000287  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 101   102   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel  nt!KiSystemCallExit2+0x18: 815d0458 sysexit 1: kd> dps @ecx L5    SYSEXIT will set ESP to ECX  note the return address  029af304  77584fca ntdll!NtQueryInformationProcess+0xa    return address 029af308  775a9628 ntdll!RtlDispatchException+0x7c 029af30c  ffffffff 029af310  00000022 029af314  029af348 1: kd> u 77584fca                ntdll!NtQueryInformationProcess+0xa: 77584fca ret     14h             this is line 4 in the last snippet 1: kd> u @edx                    SYSEXIT will set EIP to EDX ntdll!KiFastSystemCallRet: 77586954 ret                     return to 77584fca  After executing KiFastSystemCallRet  which has only one instruction: RET ,   you return to NtQueryInformationProcess.  It is instructive to compare the SYSENTER implementation on Windows 7 and   8. You will be asked to do this as an exercise.  Windows on ARM uses the SVC instruction to implement system calls. In older  documentation, SVC may be referred to as SWI, but they are the same opcode.  Recall that ARM does not have an IDT like x86 x64 but its exception vector table  has similar functionality:  .text:004D0E00 KiArmExceptionVectors .text:004D0E00   LDR.W           PC, =0xFFFFFFFF .text:004D0E04   LDR.W           PC, = KiUndefinedInstructionException+1  .text:004D0E08   LDR.W           PC, = KiSWIException+1  .text:004D0E0C   LDR.W           PC, = KiPrefetchAbortException+1  .text:004D0E10   LDR.W           PC, = KiDataAbortException+1  .text:004D0E14   LDR.W           PC, =0xFFFFFFFF .text:004D0E18   LDR.W           PC, = KiInterruptException+1  .text:004D0E1C   LDR.W           PC, = KiFIQException+1   Whenever the SVC instruction is executed, the processor switches to super- visor mode and calls KiSWIException to handle the exception. This function  can be viewed as the ARM equivalence of KiSystemCall64 on x64. Again, to  understand the whole system call process on ARM, consider the user-mode  function ntdll!NtQueryInformationProcess:  01: NtQueryInformationProcess 02:   MOV.W           R12, 0x17            ; NtQueryInformationProcess 03:   SVC             1 04:   BX              LR  The system call number is fi rst put in R12 and followed by SVC. When SVC is   executed, you go into the handler KiSWIException:  01: KiSWIException     02: trapframe= -0x1A0 03:   SUB             SP, SP, 0x1A0 04:   STRD.W          R0, R1, [SP,0x1A0+trapframe._R0]  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 102      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   103  05:   STRD.W          R2, R3, [SP,0x1A0+trapframe._R2] 06:   STR.W           R12, [SP,0x1A0+trapframe._R12] 07:   STR.W           R11, [SP,0x1A0+trapframe._R11] 08:   ORR.W           LR, LR, 1 09:   MOVS            R0, 0x30 10:   MRC             p15, 0, R12,c13,c0, 3 ; get the current thread 11:   STRD.W          LR, R0, [SP,0x1A0+trapframe._Pc] ; LR is the return                                                          ; address after the                                                         ; SVC instruction.

Interrupts can be divided into two general  categories: software and hardware. Software interrupts are synchronous events  that are triggered by conditions in the running code  divide by 0, execution of an  INT instruction, page fault, etc. ; hardware interrupts are asynchronous events  that are triggered by devices connected to the CPU. Hardware interrupts are  asynchronous because they can happen at any time; they are typically used to  indicate I O operations to the processor. The details of how hardware inter- rupts work are hardware-specifi c and hence abstracted away by the hardware  abstraction layer  HAL  component of Windows.  Concretely speaking, an IRQL is simply a number  defi ned by the type KIRQL,  which is actually a UCHAR  assigned to a processor. Windows associates an IRQL   c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 104      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   105  with an interrupt and defi nes the order in which it is handled. The exact num- ber associated with each IRQL may vary from platform to platform, so we will  reference them only by name. The general rule is that interrupts at IRQL X will  mask all interrupts that are less than X. Once the interrupt is handled, the kernel  lowers the IRQL so that it can run other tasks. Because IRQL is a per-processor  value, multiple processors can simultaneously operate at different IRQLs.  There are several different IRQLs, but the most important ones to remember   are as follows:     PASSIVE LEVEL  0 —This is the lowest IRQL in the system. All user-  mode code and most kernel code executes at this IRQL.     APC LEVEL  1  —This is the IRQL at which asynchronous procedure calls   APCs  are executed.  See the section “Asynchronous Procedure Calls.”     DISPATCH LEVEL  2  —This is the highest software IRQL in the system.  The thread dispatcher and deferred procedure calls  DPCs  run at this  IRQL.  See the section “Deferred Procedure Calls.”  Code at this IRQL  cannot wait.  IRQLs higher than DISPATCH_LEVEL are typically associated with real hard-  N O T E  ware interrupts or extremely low-level synchronization mechanisms. For example,  IPI_LEVEL is used for communication between processors.  While it seems like IRQL is a thread-scheduling property, it is not. It is a per-  processor property, whereas thread priority is a per-thread property.  Because IRQL is a software abstraction of interrupt priority, the underlying  implementation has a direct correlation with the hardware. For example, on  x86 x64, the local interrupt controller  LAPIC  in the processor has a program- mable task priority register  TPR  and a read-only processor priority register   PPR . The TPR determines the interrupt priority; the PPR represents the current  interrupt priority. The processor will deliver only interrupts whose priority is  higher than the PPR. In practical terms, when Windows needs to change the  interrupt priority, it calls the kernel functions KeRaiseIrql KeLowerIrql, which  program the TPR on the local APIC. This can be observed in the defi nition on  x64  on x64, CR8 is a shadow register allowing quick access to the LAPIC TPR;  x86 systems must program the LAPIC to set the TPR : KeRaiseIrql  01: KzRaiseIrql proc near 02:   mov     rax, cr8 03:   movzx   ecx, cl 04:   mov     cr8, rcx 05:   retn 06: KzRaiseIrql endp  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 105   106   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel  KeLowerIrql  01: KzLowerIrql proc near 02:   movzx   eax, cl 03:   mov     cr8, rax 04:   retn 05: KzLowerIrql endp  The preceding concepts explain why code running at high IRQL cannot be   preempted by code at lower IRQL.  Pool Memory Similar to user-mode applications, kernel-mode code can allocate memory at  run-time. The general name for it is pool memory; one can think it like the heap  in user mode. Pool memory is generally divided into two types: paged pool and  non-paged pool. Paged pool memory is memory that can be paged out at any  given time by the memory manager. When kernel-mode code touches a buf- fer that is paged out, it triggers a page-fault exception that causes the memory  manager to page in that buffer from disk. Non-paged pool memory is memory  that can never be paged out; in other words, accessing such memory never  triggers a page fault.  This distinction is important because it has consequences for code running  at high IRQLs. Suppose a kernel thread is currently running at DISPATCH_LEVEL  and it references memory that has been paged out and needs to be handled by  the page-fault handler; because the page fault handler  see MmAccessFault  needs  to issue a request to bring the page from disk and the thread dispatcher runs at  DISPATCH_LEVEL, it cannot resolve the exception and results in a bugcheck. This  is one of the reasons why code running at DISPATCH_LEVEL must only reside in  and access non-paged pool memory.  Pool memory is allocated and freed by the ExAllocatePool* and ExFreePool*  family of functions. By default, non-paged pool memory  type NonPagedPool  is  mapped with read, write, and execute permission on x86 x64, but non-executable  on ARM; on Windows 8, one can request non-executable, non-paged pool memory  by specifying the NonPagedPoolNX pool type. Paged pool memory is mapped  read, write, executable on x86, but non-executable on x64 ARM.  Memory Descriptor Lists A memory descriptor list  MDL  is a data structure used to describe a set of  physical pages mapped by a virtual address. Each MDL entry describes one  contiguous buffer, and multiple entries can be linked together. Once an MDL is  built for an existing buffer, the physical pages can be locked in memory  mean- ing they will not be reused  and can be mapped into another virtual address.   c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 106      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   107  To be useful, MDLs must be initialized, probed, and locked, and then mapped.  To better understand the concept, consider some of the practical uses of MDLs. Suppose a driver needs to map some memory in kernel space to the user-mode  address space of a process or vice versa. In order to achieve this, it would fi rst  initialize an MDL to describe the memory buffer  IoAllocateMdl , ensure that the  current thread has access to those pages and lock them  MmProbeAndLockPages ,  and then map those pages in memory  MmMapLockedPagesSpecifyCache  in  that process.  Another scenario is when a driver needs to write to some read-only pages   such as those in the code section . One way to achieve this is through MDLs.  The driver would initialize the MDL, lock it, and then map it to another virtual  address with write permission. In this scenario, the driver can use MDLs to  implement a VirtualProtect-like function in kernel mode.  Processes and Threads A thread is defi ned by two kernel data structures: ETHREAD and KTHREAD. An  ETHREAD structure contains housekeeping information about the thread  i.e.,  thread id, associated process, debugging enabled disabled, etc. . A KTHREAD  structure stores scheduling information for the thread dispatcher, such as  thread stack information, processor on which to run, alertable state, and so on.  An ETHREAD contains a KTHREAD.  The Windows scheduler operates on threads. A process contains at least one thread and is defi ned by two kernel data  structures: EPROCESS and KPROCESS. An EPROCESS structure stores basic infor- mation about the process  i.e., process id, security token, list of threads, etc. .  A KPROCESS structure stores scheduling information for the process  i.e., page  directory table, ideal processor, system user time, etc. . An EPROCESS contains a  KPROCESS. Just like ETHREAD and KTHREAD, these data structures are also opaque  and should only be accessed with documented kernel routines. However, you  can view their fi eld members through the kernel debugger, as follows: Processes  kd> dt nt!_EPROCESS    +0x000 Pcb              : _KPROCESS    +0x2c8 ProcessLock      : _EX_PUSH_LOCK    +0x2d0 CreateTime       : _LARGE_INTEGER    +0x2d8 RundownProtect   : _EX_RUNDOWN_REF    +0x2e0 UniqueProcessId  : Ptr64 Void    +0x2e8 ActiveProcessLinks : _LIST_ENTRY    +0x2f8 Flags2           : Uint4B    +0x2f8 JobNotReallyActive : Pos 0, 1 Bit    +0x2f8 AccountingFolded : Pos 1, 1 Bit    +0x2f8 NewProcessReported : Pos 2, 1 Bit ...  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 107   108   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel     +0x3d0 InheritedFromUniqueProcessId : Ptr64 Void    +0x3d8 LdtInformation   : Ptr64 Void    +0x3e0 CreatorProcess   : Ptr64 _EPROCESS    +0x3e0 ConsoleHostProcess : Uint8B    +0x3e8 Peb              : Ptr64 _PEB    +0x3f0 Session          : Ptr64 Void ... 0: kd> dt nt!_KPROCESS    +0x000 Header           : _DISPATCHER_HEADER    +0x018 ProfileListHead  : _LIST_ENTRY    +0x028 DirectoryTableBase : Uint8B    +0x030 ThreadListHead   : _LIST_ENTRY    +0x040 ProcessLock      : Uint4B ...    +0x0f0 ReadyListHead    : _LIST_ENTRY    +0x100 SwapListEntry    : _SINGLE_LIST_ENTRY    +0x108 ActiveProcessors : _KAFFINITY_EX ...

For example, one way to hide a  process is to remove it from the ActiveProcessLinks ﬁ eld in the EPROCESS struc- ture. However, because they are opaque and undocumented, the ﬁ eld oﬀ sets can  and  do  change from release to release.  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 108      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   109  There are also analogous user-mode data structures storing information about  processes and threads. For processes, there is the process environment block  PEB  ntdll!_PEB , which stores basic information such as base load address, loaded  modules, process heaps, and so on. For threads, there is the thread environment  block  TEB ntdll!_TEB , which stores thread scheduling data and information  for the associated process. User-mode code can always access the TEB through  the FS  x86 , GS  x64  segment, or coprocessor 15  ARM . You will frequently see  system code accessing these objects, so they are listed here: Current Thread  Kernel Mode  x86  mov     eax, large fs:124h  mov     rax, gs:188h  x64  ARM  x64  ARM  MRC             p15, 0, R3,c13,c0, 3 BICS.W          R0, R3, 0x3F  TEB  User Mode  x86  mov     edx, large fs:18h  mov     rax, gs:30h  MRC             p15, 0, R4,c13,c0, 2  Execution Context Every running thread has an execution context. An execution context contains  the address space, security token, and other important properties of the run- ning thread. At any given time, Windows has hundreds of threads running in  different execution contexts. From a kernel perspective, three general execution  contexts can be defi ned:     Thread context—Context of a specifi c thread  or usually the requestor  thread in the case of a user-mode thread requesting service from the kernel      System context—Context of a thread executing in the System process    Arbitrary context—Context of whatever thread was running before the   scheduler took over  Recall that each process has its own address space. While in kernel mode, it  is important to know what context your code is running in because that deter- mines the address space you are in and security privileges you own. There is   c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 109   110   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel  no list of rules to precisely determine the execution context in a given scenario,  but the following general tips can help:     When a driver is loaded, its entry point  DriverEntry  executes in System   context.     When a user-mode application sends a request  IOCTL  to a driver, the  driver’s IOCTL handler runs in thread context  i.e., the context of the  user-mode thread that initiated the request .      APCs run in thread context  i.e., the context of the thread in which the   APC was queued .     DPCs and timers run in arbitrary context.    Work items run in System context.    System threads run in System context if the ProcessHandle parameter is   NULL  common case .  For example, a driver’s entry point only has access to the System process  address space and hence cannot access any other process space without causing  an access violation. If a kernel-mode thread wants to change its execution con- text to another process, it can use the documented API KeStackAttachProcess.  This is useful when a driver needs to read write a specifi c process’ memory.  Kernel Synchronization Primitives The kernel provides common synchronization primitives to be used by other  components. The most common ones are events, spin locks, mutexes, resource  locks, and timers. This section explains their interface and discusses their usage. Event objects are used to indicate the state of an operation. For example,  when the system is running low on non-paged pool memory, the kernel can  notify a driver through events. An event can be in one of two states: signaled or  non-signaled. The meaning of signaled and non-signaled depends on the usage  scenario. Internally, an event is an object defi ned by the KEVENT structure and  initialized by the KeInitializeEvent API. After initializing the event, a thread  can wait for it with KeWaitForSingleObject or KeWaitForMultipleObjects.  Events are commonly used in drivers to notify other threads that something is  fi nished processing or a particular condition was satisfi ed.  Timers are used to indicate that a certain time interval has passed. For example,  whenever we enter a new century, the kernel executes some code to update the  time; the underlying mechanism for this is timers. Internally, timer objects are  defi ned by the KTIMER structure and initialized by the KeInitializeTimer Ex  routine. When initializing timers, one can specify an optional DPC routine to  be executed when they expire. By defi nition, each processor has its own timer   c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 110      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   111  queue; specifi cally, the TimerTable fi eld in the PRCB is a list of timers for that  particular processor. Timers are commonly used to do something in a periodic  or time-specifi c manner. Both timers and DPCs are covered in more detail later  in this chapter.  Mutexes are used for exclusive access to a shared resource. For example, if  two threads are concurrently modifying a shared linked list without a mutex,  they may corrupt the list; the solution is to only access the linked list while  holding a mutex. While the core semantic of a mutex does not change, the  Windows kernel offers two different kinds of mutexes: guarded mutex and fast  mutex. Guarded mutexes are faster than fast mutexes but are only available on  Windows 2003 and higher. Internally, a mutex is defi ned by either a FAST_MUTEX  or GUARDED_MUTEX structure and initialized by ExInitialize{Fast,Guarded} Mutex. After initialization, they can be acquired and released through different  APIs; see the Windows Driver Kit documentation for more information.  Spin locks are also used for exclusive access to a shared resource. While they  are conceptually similar to mutexes, they are used to protect shared resources  that are accessed at DISPATCH_LEVEL or higher IRQL. For example, the kernel  acquires a spin lock before modifying critical global data structures such as  the active process list; it must do this because on a multi-processor system,  multiple threads can be accessing and modifying the list at the same time.  Internally, spin locks are defi ned by the KSPIN_LOCK structure and initialized  with KeInitializeSpinLock. After initialization, they can be acquired released  through various documented APIs; see the WDK documentation for more infor- mation. Note that code holding on to a spin lock is executing at DISPATCH_LEVEL  or higher; hence, the executing code and the memory it touches must always  be resident.  Lists  Linked lists are the fundamental building blocks of dynamic data structures in  the kernel and drivers. Many important kernel data structures  such as those  related to processes and threads  are built on top of lists. In fact, lists are so com- monly used that the WDK provides a set of functions to create and manipulate  them in a generic way. Although lists are conceptually simple and have no  direct relationship to the understanding of kernel concepts or the practice of  reverse engineering, they are introduced here for two important reasons. First,  they are used in practically every Windows kernel data structure discussed in  this chapter. The kernel commonly operates on entries from various lists  i.e.,  loaded module list, active process list, waiting threads list, etc.  contained in  these structures, so it’s important to understand the mechanics of such opera- tions. Second, while the functions operating on lists, e.g., InsertHeadList,   c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 111   112   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel  InsertTailList, RemoveHeadList, RemoveEntryList, etc., appear in source form  in the WDK headers, they are always inlined by the compiler and consequently  will never appear as “functions” at the assembly level in real-life binaries; in  other words, they will never appear as a call or branch destination. Hence, you  need to understand their implementation details and usage patterns so that you  can recognize them at the assembly level.  Implementation Details The WDK provides functions supporting three list types:     Singly-linked list—A list whose entries are linked together with one   pointer  Next .     Sequenced singly-linked list—A singly-linked list with support for  atomic operations. For example, you can delete the fi rst entry from the  list without worrying about acquiring a lock.      Circular doubly-linked list—A list whose entries are linked together with  two pointers, one pointing to the next entry  Flink  and one pointing to  the previous entry  Blink .  All three are conceptually identical in terms of usage at the source code level.  This chapter covers only doubly-linked lists because they are the most common.  In one of the exercises, you will be asked to review the WDK documentation on  list operations and write a driver that uses all three list types.  The implementation is built on top of one structure:  typedef struct _LIST_ENTRY {    struct _LIST_ENTRY *Flink;    struct _LIST_ENTRY *Blink; } LIST_ENTRY, *PLIST_ENTRY;  A LIST_ENTRY can represent a list head or a list entry. A list head represents  the “head” of the list and usually does not store any data except for the LIST_ ENTRY structure itself; all list functions require a pointer to the list head. A list  entry is the actual entry that stores data; in real life, it is a LIST_ENTRY structure  embedded inside a larger structure.  Lists must be initialized with InitializeListHead before usage. This func- tion simply sets the Flink and Blink fi elds to point to the list head. Its code is  shown below and illustrated in Figure 3-4:  VOID InitializeListHead PLIST_ENTRY ListHead  {     ListHead->Flink = ListHead->Blink = ListHead;     return; }  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 112      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   113  In assembly form, this would translate to three instructions: one to retrieve  ListHead and two to fi ll out the Flink and Blink pointers. Consider how  InitializeListHead manifests itself in x86, x64, and the ARM assembly:  Flink  Blink  Figure 3-4  x86  x64  ARM  lea     eax, [esi+2Ch] mov     [eax+4], eax mov     [eax], eax  lea     r11, [rbx+48h] mov     [r11+8], r11 mov     [r11], r11  ADDS.W          R3, R4, 0x2C STR             R3, [R3,4] STR             R3, [R3]  In all three cases, the same pointer and register are used in write-only opera- tions. Another key observation is that the writes at offset +0 and +4 8 from the  base register; these offsets correspond to the Flink and Blink pointers in the  structure. Whenever you see this code pattern, you should think of lists.  After initializing the list, entries can be inserted at the head or the tail. As  mentioned previously, a list entry is simply a LIST_ENTRY inside a larger struc- ture; for example, the kernel KDPC structure  discussed later in the chapter   has a DpcListEntry fi eld: C Deﬁ nition  typedef struct _KDPC {     UCHAR Type;     UCHAR Importance;     volatile USHORT Number;     LIST_ENTRY DpcListEntry;     PKDEFERRED_ROUTINE DeferredRoutine;     PVOID DeferredContext;     PVOID SystemArgument1;     PVOID SystemArgument2;     __volatile PVOID DpcData; } KDPC, *PKDPC, *PRKDPC;  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 113   114   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel  x64  0: kd> dt nt!_KDPC    +0x000 Type             : UChar    +0x001 Importance       : UChar    +0x002 Number           : Uint2B    +0x008 DpcListEntry     : _LIST_ENTRY    +0x018 DeferredRoutine  : Ptr64     void    +0x020 DeferredContext  : Ptr64 Void    +0x028 SystemArgument1  : Ptr64 Void    +0x030 SystemArgument2  : Ptr64 Void    +0x038 DpcData          : Ptr64 Void  Suppose you have a list with one KDPC entry, as shown in Figure 3-5.  Insertion is done with InsertHeadList and InsertTailList. Consider the   insertion of an entry at the head, as shown in Figure 3-6.

The point here is to observe how  the new entry is inserted in the list. Instruction scheduling might change the order of  some instructions, but they will be mostly the same.

In order to do useful things with a list entry, code needs to manipu- late the actual data in the entry. How do programs access fi elds in a list entry?  This is done with the CONTAINING_RECORD macro:  define CONTAINING_RECORD address, type, field    type *   \                                               PCHAR  address  - \                                               ULONG_PTR  &  type  * 0 ->field     CONTAINING_RECORD returns the base address of a structure using the following  method: It calculates the offset of a fi eld in a structure by casting the structure  pointer to 0, then subtracts that from the real address of the fi eld. In practice,  this macro usually takes the address of the LIST_ENTRY fi eld in the list entry,   c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 118      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   119  the type of the list entry, and the name of that fi eld. For example, suppose you  have a list of KDPC entries  see defi nition earlier  and you want a function to  access the DeferredRoutine fi eld; the code would be as follows:  PKDEFERRED_ROUTINE ReadEntryDeferredRoutine  PLIST_ENTRY entry  {        PKDPC p;        p = CONTAINING_RECORD entry, KDPC, DpcListEntry ;        return p->DeferredRoutine; }  This macro is commonly used immediately after calling one of the list removal   routines or during list entry enumeration.  Walk-Through Having discussed the concepts and implementation details of the list manip- ulation functions in kernel mode, we will now apply that to the analysis of  Sample C. This walk-through has three objectives:     Show one common usage of lists in a real-life driver rootkit    Demonstrate the uncertainties a reverse engineer faces in practice    Discuss the problems of undocumented structures and hardcoded offsets  This driver does many things, but we are only interested in two functions:   sub_11553 and sub_115DA. Consider the following snippet from sub_115DA:  01: .text:000115FF   mov     eax, dword_1436C 02: .text:00011604   mov     edi, ds:wcsncpy 03: .text:0001160A   mov     ebx, [eax] 04: .text:0001160C   mov     esi, ebx 05: .text:0001160E loop_begin:                           06: .text:0001160E   cmp     dword ptr [esi+20h], 0 07: .text:00011612   jz      short failed 08: .text:00011614   push    dword ptr [esi+28h]         09: .text:00011617   call    ds:MmIsAddressValid 10: .text:0001161D   test    al, al 11: .text:0001161F   jz      short failed 12: .text:00011621   mov     eax, [esi+28h] 13: .text:00011624   test    eax, eax 14: .text:00011626   jz      short failed 15: .text:00011628   movzx   ecx, word ptr [esi+24h] 16: .text:0001162C   shr     ecx, 1 17: .text:0001162E   push    ecx                           ; size_t 18: .text:0001162F   push    eax                           ; wchar_t * 19: .text:00011630   lea     eax, [ebp+var_208] 20: .text:00011636   push    eax                           ; wchar_t * 21: .text:00011637   call    edi ; wcsncpy 22: .text:00011639   lea     eax, [ebp+var_208] 23: .text:0001163F   push    eax                           ; wchar_t * 24: .text:00011640   call    ds:_wcslwr 25: .text:00011646   lea     eax, [ebp+var_208]  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 119   120   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel  26: .text:0001164C   push    offset aKrnl                  ; "krnl" 27: .text:00011651   push    eax                           ; wchar_t * 28: .text:00011652   call    ds:wcsstr 29: .text:00011658   add     esp, 18h 30: .text:0001165B   test    eax, eax 31: .text:0001165D   jnz     short matched_krnl 32: .text:0001165F   mov     esi, [esi] 33: .text:00011661   cmp     esi, ebx 34: .text:00011663   jz      short loop_end 35: .text:00011665   jmp     short loop_begin 36: .text:00011667 matched_krnl:                          37: .text:00011667   lea     eax, [ebp+var_208] 38: .text:0001166D   push    '\'                           ; wchar_t 39: .text:0001166F   push    eax                           ; wchar_t * 40: .text:00011670   call    ds:wcsrchr 41: .text:00011676   pop     ecx 42: .text:00011677   test    eax, eax  Lines 1–4 read a pointer from a global variable at dword_1436C and save it  in EBX and ESI. The loop body references this pointer at offset 0x20 and 0x28;  therefore, you can deduce that it is a pointer to a structure of at least 0x2c bytes  in size. At the end of the loop, it reads another pointer from the structure and  compares it against the original pointer  saved in line 3 . Note that the pointer  is read from offset 0. Hence, at this point, you can surmise that this loop is iter- ating over a list in which the “next” pointer is at offset 0. Can you claim that  this structure contains a LIST_ENTRY fi eld at offset 0? No, there is not enough  concrete data at the moment to support that. Let’s fi gure out where the global  variable dword_1436C comes from.  sub_11553 uses the STDCALL calling convention and takes two parameters:  a pointer to a DRIVER_OBJECT, and a pointer to a global variable dword_1436C.  It has the following interesting code snippet:  01: .text:00011578   mov     eax, 0FFDFF034h 02: .text:0001157D   mov     eax, [eax] 03: .text:0001157F   mov     eax, [eax+70h] 04: ... 05: .text:0001159E   mov     ecx, [ebp+arg_4]  ; pointer to the global var 06: .text:000115A1   mov     [ecx], eax  Line 2 reads a pointer from a hardcoded address, 0xFFDFF034. On Windows  XP, there is a processor control block structure  discussed later in the chapter   at 0xFFDFF000 and offset 0x34 is the KdVersionBlock pointer. Lines 3–6 read  a pointer value at offset 0x70 into the KdVersionBlock and write it back to the  global variable; you know it is a pointer because it is used to iterate the list  entries in sub_115DA. In order to fi gure out the exact list entry type, you need to  determine what is at offset 0x70 of the KdVersionBlock structure. Because this is  an undocumented OS-specifi c structure, you have to either reverse engineer the  Windows XP kernel or search the Internet to see if other people already fi gured it  out. The results indicate that on Windows XP, offset 0x70 of the KdVersionBlock   c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 120      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   121  structure is a pointer to a global list head called PsLoadedModuleList. Each  entry in this list is of type KLDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY and it stores information  about currently loaded kernel modules  name, base address, size, etc. ; the fi rst  member in this structure is of type LIST_ENTRY. This makes sense because we  previously deduced that at offset 0 is the “next” pointer  Flink to be precise .  N O T E  The structure KLDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY is undocumented, but it is very  similar to LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY, which is in the public symbols. On Windows XP,  the FullDllName and BaseDllName ﬁ elds are at the same oﬀ set  0x24 and 0x2c .  Assuming that the information from the Internet is correct, these two func-  tions can be summarized as follows:     sub_11553 reads the KdVersionBlock pointer from the processor control  block and retrieves the pointer to PsLoadedModuleList from there; it saves  this pointer to the global variable. PsLoadedModuleList is the head of a  list whose list entries are of type KLDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY. This function  will be given the friendly name GetLoadedModuleList.     sub_115DA uses the list head pointer to iterate over all entries searching  for a module name with the substring "krnl". The code searches for the  substring "krnl" because the author is looking for the NT kernel image  name  usually “ntoskrnl.exe” . This function will be given the friendly  name GetKernelName.  You can briefl y translate them back to C:   typedef struct _KLDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY {     LIST_ENTRY ListEntry;     ...     UNICODE_STRING FullDllName;     UNICODE_STRING BaseDllName;     ... } KLDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY, *PKLDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY;  BOOL GetLoadedModuleList PDRIVER_OBJECT drvobj, PLIST_ENTRY g_modlist  {     ...     g_modlist =  PCR->KdVersionBlock  + 0x70     ... }  BOOL GetKernelName   {     WCHAR fname[...];     PKLDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY entry;     PLIST_ENTRY p = g_modlist->Flink;     while  p != g_modlist      {  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 121   122   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel         entry = CONTAINING_RECORD p, KLDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY, ListEntry ;        ...        wcsncpy fname, entry->FullDllName.Buffer, entry->FullDllName .Length * 2 ;        ...        if  wcsstr fname, L"krnl"  != NULL  { ... }        p = p->Flink;     }     ... }  While this driver may seem to work on a specifi c version of Windows, there  are several problems with it. First, it assumes that the PCR is always located  at 0xFFDFF000 and that the KdVersionBlock is always at offset 0x34; these  assumptions do not hold for Windows Vista+. Second, the driver assumes that  KdVersionBlock always contains a valid value; this is untrue because the value  is valid only for the fi rst processor’s PCR. Hence, if this code were executed on  a multi-processor system and the thread happened to be scheduled on another  processor, this code would crash. Third, it assumes that there is a UNICODE_STRING  at offset 0x24 in the KLDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY structure  which is undocumented  itself ; this may not always be true because Microsoft may add or remove fi elds  from the structure defi nition, causing the offset to change. Fourth, this code will  certainly fail on an x64 kernel because the offsets are all different. Finally, the  loaded module list may change  i.e., drivers being unloaded  while the driver is  iterating the list; hence, it may receive stale results or lead to an access violation  as a result of accessing a module that is no longer there. Also note that the driver  does not use any kind of locking mechanism while iterating a global list. As you  analyze more kernel-mode rootkits or third-party drivers, you will frequently  encounter code written with these premature assumptions.  For this particular sample, you can tell that the developer just wants to get  the kernel image name and base address. This could have been easily achieved  using the documented kernel API   AuxKlibQueryModuleInformation.  See also  the exercise on AuxKlibQueryModuleInformation.   To conclude, we would like to briefl y discuss the thinking process in analyzing  these two functions. How were we able to go from seemingly random values  such as 0xFFDF034, 0x70, and 0x28 to PCR, KdVersionBlock, PsLoadedModuleList,  KLDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY, and so on? The truth is that we already have previ- ous kernel knowledge and experience analyzing kernel-mode drivers so we  instinctively thought about these structures. For example, we started with a  loop that processes each list entry looking for the substring "krnl"; we imme- diately guessed that they are searching for the kernel image name. The string  and length offsets  0x24 and 0x28  alerted us of a UNICODE_STRING; with our  kernel knowledge, we guessed that this is the KLDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY structure  and verifi ed that it is indeed the case using public symbols. Next, we know that  PsLoadedModuleList is the global list head for the loaded module list. Because   c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 122      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   123  PsLoadedModuleList is not an exported symbol, we know that the driver must  retrieve this from another structure. Going backwards, we see the hardcoded  memory address 0xFFDF034 and immediately think of the PCR. We verify this  in the debugger:  0: kd> dt nt!_KPCR 0xffdff000    +0x000 NtTib            : _NT_TIB    +0x01c SelfPcr          : 0xffdff000 _KPCR    +0x020 Prcb             : 0xffdff120 _KPRCB    +0x024 Irql             : 0 ''    +0x028 IRR              : 0    +0x02c IrrActive        : 0    +0x030 IDR              : 0xffffffff    +0x034 KdVersionBlock   : 0x8054d2b8 Void …  From experience, we know that KdVersionBlock is a pointer to a large structure  storing interesting information such as the kernel base address and list heads.  At that point, we have all the information and data structures to understand  the code.  As you can see, there is a systematic thinking process behind the analysis;  however, it requires a substantial amount of background knowledge about the  operating system, and experience. When you are fi rst starting, you may not  have all the knowledge and intuition required to quickly understand kernel- mode drivers. Have no fear! This book attempts to provide a strong foundation  by explaining all the major kernel concepts and data structures. With a strong  foundation and a lot of practice  see the exercises , you will eventually be able to  do it with great ease. Remember: foundational knowledge + intuition + experi- ence + patience = skills.  Exercises    1.

Repeat the previous exercises on Windows 8 x86 ARM and Windows 7   x86 x64. What were the differences  if any ?    8.  If you did the exercises for  InsertHeadList,  InsertTailList,  RemoveHeadList, RemoveTailList, and RemoveEntryList on Windows  8, you should have observed a code construct common to all these func- tions. This construct should also enable you to easily spot the inlined list  insertion and removal routines. Explain this code construct and why it is  there. Hint: This construct exists only on Windows 8 and it requires you  to look at the IDT.    9.  In the walk-through, we mentioned that a driver can enumerate all loaded  modules with the documented API AuxKlibQueryModuleInformation. Does  this API guarantee that the returned module list is always up-to-date? Explain  your answer. Next, reverse engineer AuxKlibQueryModuleInformation on  Windows 8 and explain how it works. How does it handle the case when  multiple threads are requesting access to the loaded module list? Note:  The internal function handling this request  and others  is fairly large, so  you will need some patience. Alternatively, you can use a debugger to  help you trace the interesting code.    10.  Explain  how  the  following  functions  work:  KeInsertQueueDpc,  KiRetireDpcList, KiExecuteDpc, and KiExecuteAllDpcs. If you feel like  an overachiever, decompile those functions from the x86 and x64 assem- blies and explain the differences.  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 127   128   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel  Asynchronous and Ad-Hoc Execution  During the lifetime of a driver, it may create system threads, register callbacks  for certain events, queue a function to be executed in the future, and so on. This  section covers a variety of mechanisms a driver can use to achieve these forms  of asynchronous and ad-hoc execution. The mechanisms covered include system  threads, work items, APCs, DPCs, timers, and process and thread callbacks.  System Threads A typical user-mode program may have multiple threads handling different  requests. Similarly, a driver may create multiple threads to handle requests from  the kernel or user. These threads can be created with the PsCreateSystemThread  API:  NTSTATUS PsCreateSystemThread    _Out_      PHANDLE ThreadHandle,   _In_       ULONG DesiredAccess,   _In_opt_   POBJECT_ATTRIBUTES ObjectAttributes,   _In_opt_   HANDLE ProcessHandle,   _Out_opt_  PCLIENT_ID ClientId,   _In_       PKSTART_ROUTINE StartRoutine,   _In_opt_   PVOID StartContext  ;  If called with a NULL ProcessHandle parameter, this API will create a new  thread in the System process and set its start routine to StartRoutine. The usage  of system threads varies according to driver requirement. For example, the driver  may decide to create a thread during initialization to handle subsequent I O  requests or wait on some events. One concrete example is the kernel creating a  system thread to process DPCs  see also the KiStartDpcThread function .  Exercises    1.  After reading some online forums, you notice some people suggest- ing that PsCreateSystemThread will create a thread in the context of  the calling process. In other words, they are suggesting that if you call  PsCreateSystemThread in an IOCTL handler, the new thread will be in  the context of the requesting user-mode application. Assess the validity  of this statement by writing a driver that calls PsCreateSystemThread in  the IOCTL handler. Next, experiment with a non-NULL ProcessHandle  and determine if the context differs.    2.  Cross-reference as many calls to PsCreateSystemThread as possible in  the kernel image. Determine whether any of them pass a non-NULL   c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 128      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   129  ProcessHandle parameter. Explain the purpose of these routines. Repeat  the exercise for as many functions as possible.  Work Items Work items are similar to system threads except that no physical thread objects  are created for them. A work item is simply an object in a queue processed by a  pool of system threads. Concretely speaking, a work item is a structure defi ned  as follows:  0: kd> dt nt!_IO_WORKITEM    +0x000 WorkItem         : _WORK_QUEUE_ITEM    +0x020 Routine          : Ptr64     void    +0x028 IoObject         : Ptr64 Void    +0x030 Context          : Ptr64 Void    +0x038 Type             : Uint4B    +0x03c ActivityId       : _GUID 0: kd> dt nt!_WORK_QUEUE_ITEM    +0x000 List             : _LIST_ENTRY    +0x010 WorkerRoutine    : Ptr64     void    +0x018 Parameter        : Ptr64 Void  Note that its WorkItem fi eld is actually a list entry containing the worker  routine and parameter. This entry will eventually be inserted into a queue  later. A driver calls the function IoAllocateWorkItem to get back a pointer to  an IO_WORKITEM allocated in non-paged pool. Next, the driver initializes and  queues the work item by calling IoQueueWorkItem:  PIO_WORKITEM IoAllocateWorkItem    _In_  PDEVICE_OBJECT DeviceObject  ;  VOID IoQueueWorkItem    _In_      PIO_WORKITEM IoWorkItem,   _In_      PIO_WORKITEM_ROUTINE WorkerRoutine,   _In_      WORK_QUEUE_TYPE QueueType,   _In_opt_  PVOID Context  ;  and queue priority type:  IO_WORKITEM_ROUTINE WorkItem;  VOID WorkItem    _In_      PDEVICE_OBJECT DeviceObject,   _In_opt_  PVOID Context   { ... }  The initialization part simply fi lls in the worker routine, parameter context,   c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 129   130   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel  typedef enum _WORK_QUEUE_TYPE {    CriticalWorkQueue       = 0,   DelayedWorkQueue        = 1,   HyperCriticalWorkQueue  = 2,   MaximumWorkQueue        = 3 } WORK_QUEUE_TYPE;  Where is it queued? As explained earlier, each processor has an associated  KPRCB that contains a fi eld called ParentNode, which is a pointer to a KNODE  structure; when the processor is initialized, this pointer points to an ENODE  structure that holds the work items queue: Work items queue  0: kd> dt nt!_KPRCB ...    +0x5338 ParentNode       : Ptr64 _KNODE 0: kd> dt nt!_KNODE    +0x000 DeepIdleSet      : Uint8B    +0x040 ProximityId      : Uint4B    +0x044 NodeNumber       : Uint2B 0: kd> dt nt!_ENODE    +0x000 Ncb              : _KNODE    +0x0c0 ExWorkerQueues   : [7] _EX_WORK_QUEUE    +0x2f0 ExpThreadSetManagerEvent : _KEVENT    +0x308 ExpWorkerThreadBalanceManagerPtr : Ptr64 _ETHREAD    +0x310 ExpWorkerSeed    : Uint4B    +0x314 ExWorkerFullInit : Pos 0, 1 Bit    +0x314 ExWorkerStructInit : Pos 1, 1 Bit    +0x314 ExWorkerFlags    : Uint4B 0: kd> dt nt!_EX_WORK_QUEUE    +0x000 WorkerQueue      : _KQUEUE    +0x040 WorkItemsProcessed : Uint4B    +0x044 WorkItemsProcessedLastPass : Uint4B    +0x048 ThreadCount      : Int4B    +0x04c TryFailed        : UChar  ExQueueWorkItemEx  ExQueueWorkItemEx proc near ... mov     rax, gs:20h mov     r8, [rax+5338h]       ; enode movzx   eax, word ptr [r8+44h] mov     ecx, eax lea     rax, [rax+rax*2] shl     rax, 6 add     rax, rbp ... mov     edx, r9d   ; queue type mov     rcx, r11   ; workitem passed in call    ExpQueueWorkItemNode  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 130      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   131  What actually happens is that each processor has several queues to store  the work items and there is a system thread dequeueing one item at a time for  execution. This system thread responsible for dequeueing is ExpWorkerThread. As previously explained, work items are lightweight because they do not  require new thread objects to be created. They also have two important properties:     They are executed in the context of the System process. The reason is   because the ExpWorkerThread runs in the System process.     They are executed at PASSIVE_LEVEL.  Due to their lightweight nature, it is a common driver programming pattern   to queue work items inside a DPC.  Exercises    1.  Explain how we were able to determine that ExpWorkerThread is the sys- tem thread responsible for dequeueing work items and executing them.  Hint: The fastest way is to write a driver.    2.  Explore IoAllocateWorkItem, IoInitializeWorkItem, IoQueueWorkItem,  IopQueueWorkItemProlog, and ExQueueWorkItem, and explain how they  work.    3.  Work items and system threads  i.e., those created by PsCreateSystemThread   are mostly identical in terms of functionality, so explain why DPCs frequently  queue work items to handle requests but never call PsCreateSystemThread.   4.  Write a driver to enumerate all work items on the system and explain the   problems you had to overcome in the process.  Asynchronous Procedure Calls Asynchronous procedure calls  APCs  are used to implement many important  operations such as asynchronous I O completion, thread suspension, and process  shutdown. Unfortunately, they are undocumented from a kernel perspective.  The offi cial driver development documentation simply includes a short section  acknowledging that APCs exist and that there are different types. However,  for common reverse engineering tasks, it is not necessary to understand all  the underlying details. This section explains what APCs are and how they are  commonly used.  APC Fundamentals   Generally speaking, APCs are functions that execute in a particular thread context.  They can be divided into two types: kernel-mode and user-mode. Kernel-mode   c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 131   132   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel  APCs can be either normal or special; normal ones execute at PASSIVE_LEVEL,  whereas special ones execute at APC_LEVEL  both execute in kernel mode . User  APCs execute at PASSIVE_LEVEL in user mode when the thread is in an alertable  state. Because APCs run in thread context, they are always associated with an  ETHREAD object.  Concretely speaking, an APC is defi ned by the KAPC structure:  1: kd> dt nt!_KAPC    +0x000 Type             : UChar    +0x001 SpareByte0       : UChar    +0x002 Size             : UChar    +0x003 SpareByte1       : UChar    +0x004 SpareLong0       : Uint4B    +0x008 Thread           : Ptr32 _KTHREAD    +0x00c ApcListEntry     : _LIST_ENTRY    +0x014 KernelRoutine    : Ptr32     void    +0x018 RundownRoutine   : Ptr32     void    +0x01c NormalRoutine    : Ptr32     void    +0x014 Reserved         : [3] Ptr32 Void    +0x020 NormalContext    : Ptr32 Void    +0x024 SystemArgument1  : Ptr32 Void    +0x028 SystemArgument2  : Ptr32 Void    +0x02c ApcStateIndex    : Char    +0x02d ApcMode          : Char    +0x02e Inserted         : UChar  NTKERNELAPI VOID KeInitializeApc      PKAPC Apc,     PKTHREAD Thread,     KAPC_ENVIRONMENT Environment,     PKKERNEL_ROUTINE KernelRoutine,     PKRUNDOWN_ROUTINE RundownRoutine,     PKNORMAL_ROUTINE NormalRoutine,     KPROCESSOR_MODE ProcessorMode,     PVOID NormalContext      ;      NTKERNELAPI BOOLEAN KeInsertQueueApc      PRKAPC Apc,     PVOID SystemArgument1,     PVOID SystemArgument2,     KPRIORITY Increment      ;  This structured is initialized by the KeInitializeApc API:  KeInitializeApc  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 132      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   133  Callback prototypes  typedef VOID  *PKKERNEL_ROUTINE       PKAPC Apc,     PKNORMAL_ROUTINE *NormalRoutine,     PVOID *NormalContext,     PVOID *SystemArgument1,     PVOID *SystemArgument2      ;  typedef VOID  *PKRUNDOWN_ROUTINE       PKAPC Apc      ;      typedef VOID  *PKNORMAL_ROUTINE       PVOID NormalContext,     PVOID SystemArgument1,     PVOID SystemArgument2      ;      typedef enum _KAPC_ENVIRONMENT {     OriginalApcEnvironment,     AttachedApcEnvironment,     CurrentApcEnvironment,     InsertApcEnvironment } KAPC_ENVIRONMENT, *PKAPC_ENVIRONMENT;  N O T E  This deﬁ nition is taken from http:  forum.sysinternals.com  howto-capture-kernel-stack-traces_topic19356.html. While we cannot  guarantee its correctness, it has been known to work in experiments.  Apc is a caller-allocated buffer of type KAPC. In practice, it is usually allocated  in non-paged pool by ExAllocatePool and freed in the kernel or normal routine.  Thread is the thread to which this APC should be queued. Environment determines  the environment in which the APC executes; for example, OriginalApcEnvironment  means that the APC will run in the thread’s process context  if it does not  attach to another process . KernelRoutine is a function that will be executed at  APC_LEVEL in kernel mode; RundownRoutine is a function that will be executed  when the thread is terminating; and NormalRoutine is a function that will be  executed at PASSIVE_LEVEL in ProcessorMode. User-mode APCs are those that  have a NormalRoutine and ProcessorMode set to UserMode. NormalContext is  the parameter passed to the NormalRoutine.  Once initialized, an APC is queued with the KeInsertQueueApc API. Apc is the  APC initialized by KeInitializeApc. SystemArgument1 and SystemArgument2  are optional arguments that can be passed to kernel and normal routines.  Increment is the number to increment the run-time priority; it is similar to the  PriorityBoost parameter in IoCompleteRequest. Where is the APC queued?   c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 133   134   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel  Recall that APCs are always associated with a thread. The KTHREAD structure  has two APC queues:  0: kd> dt nt!_KTHREAD    +0x000 Header           : _DISPATCHER_HEADER    +0x018 SListFaultAddress : Ptr64 Void    +0x020 QuantumTarget    : Uint8B …    +0x090 TrapFrame        : Ptr64 _KTRAP_FRAME    +0x098 ApcState         : _KAPC_STATE    +0x098 ApcStateFill     : [43] UChar    +0x0c3 Priority         : Char    +0x288 SchedulerApc     : _KAPC …    +0x2e0 SuspendEvent     : _KEVENT 0: kd> dt nt!_KAPC_STATE    +0x000 ApcListHead      : [2] _LIST_ENTRY    +0x020 Process          : Ptr64 _KPROCESS    +0x028 KernelApcInProgress : UChar    +0x029 KernelApcPending : UChar    +0x02a UserApcPending   : UChar  The ApcState fi eld contains an array of two queues, storing kernel-mode and   user-mode APCs, respectively.  Implementing Thread Suspension with APCs  When a program wants to suspend a thread, the kernel queues a kernel APC  to the thread. This suspension APC is the SchedulerApc fi eld in the KTHREAD  structure; it is initialized in KeInitThread with KiSchedulerApc as the normal  routine. KiSchedulerApc simply holds on the thread’s SuspendEvent. When  the program wants to resume the thread, KeResumeThread releases this event. Unless you are reverse engineering the Windows kernel or kernel-mode  rootkits, it is unlikely that you will run into code using APCs. This is primarily  because they are undocumented and hence not commonly used in commercial  drivers. However, APCs are frequently used in rootkits because they offer a  clean way to inject code into user mode from kernel mode. Rootkits achieve  this by queueing a user-mode APC to a thread in the process in which they  want to inject code.  Exercises    1.  Write a driver using both kernel-mode and user-mode APCs.   2.  Write a driver that enumerates all user-mode and kernel-mode APCs for  all threads in a process. Hint: You need to take into consideration IRQL  level when performing the enumeration.  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 134      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   135    3.  The kernel function KeSuspendThread is responsible for suspending a  thread. Earlier you learned that APCs are involved in thread suspension  in Windows 8. Explain how this function works and how APCs are used  to implement the functionality on Windows 7. What is different from  Windows 8?    4.  APCs are also used in process shutdown. The KTHREAD object has a fl ag  called ApcQueueable that determines whether an APC may be queued to it.  What happens when you disable APC queueing for a thread? Experiment  with this by starting up notepad.exe and then manually disable APC  queueing to one of its threads  use the kernel debugger to do this .    5.  Explain what the following functions do:     KiInsertQueueApc     PsExitSpecialApc     PspExitApcRundown     PspExitNormalApc     PspQueueApcSpecialApc     KiDeliverApc    6.  Explain how the function KeEnumerateQueueApc works and then recover   its prototype. Note: This function is available only on Windows 8.    7.  Explain how the kernel dispatches APCs. Write a driver that uses the dif- ferent kinds of APCs and view the stack when they are executed. Note:  We used the same method to fi gure out how the kernel dispatches work  items.  Deferred Procedure Calls Deferred procedure calls  DPCs  are routines executed at DISPATCH_LEVEL in  arbitrary thread context on a particular processor. Hardware drivers use them  to process interrupts coming from the device. A typical usage pattern is for the  interrupt service routine  ISR  to queue a DPC, which in turn queues a work  item to do the processing.  Hardware drivers do this because the ISR usually runs at high IRQLs  above  DISPATCH_LEVEL  and if it takes too long, it could reduce the system’s overall  performance. Hence, the ISR typically queues a DPC and immediately returns  so that the system can process other interrupts. Software drivers can use DPCs  to quickly execute short tasks.   Internally, a DPC is defi ned by the KDPC structure:  0: kd> dt nt!_KDPC    +0x000 Type             : UChar    +0x001 Importance       : UChar  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 135   136   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel     +0x002 Number           : Uint2B    +0x008 DpcListEntry     : _LIST_ENTRY    +0x018 DeferredRoutine  : Ptr64     void    +0x020 DeferredContext  : Ptr64 Void    +0x028 SystemArgument1  : Ptr64 Void    +0x030 SystemArgument2  : Ptr64 Void    +0x038 DpcData          : Ptr64 Void  Each fi eld’s semantic is as follows:    Type—Object type. It indicates the kernel object type for this object  i.e.,  process, thread, timer, DPC, events, etc. . Recall that kernel objects are  defi ned by the nt!_KOBJECTS enumeration. In this case, you are dealing  with DPCs, for which there are two types: normal and threaded.     Importance—DPC importance. It determines where this DPC entry should   be in the DPC queue. See also KeSetImportanceDpc.     Number—Processor number on which the DPC should be queued and   executed. See also KeSetTargetProcessorDpc.     DpcListEntry—LIST_ENTRY for the DPC entry. Internally, the inser- tion removal of DPCs from the DPC queue operate on this fi eld. See  KeInsertQueueDpc.     DeferredRoutine—The function associated with this DPC. It will be  executed in arbitrary thread context and at DISPATCH_LEVEL. It is defi ned  as follows:  KDEFERRED_ROUTINE CustomDpc; VOID CustomDpc    _In_      struct _KDPC *Dpc,   _In_opt_  PVOID DeferredContext,   _In_opt_  PVOID SystemArgument1,   _In_opt_  PVOID SystemArgument2   { ... }     DeferredContext—Parameter to pass to the DPC function.    SystemArgument1—Custom data to store in the DPC.    SystemArgument2— Custom data to store in the DPC.    DpcData—A pointer to a KDPC_DATA structure:  0: kd> dt nt!_KDPC_DATA    +0x000 DpcListHead      : _LIST_ENTRY    +0x010 DpcLock          : Uint8B  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 136      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   137     +0x018 DpcQueueDepth    : Int4B    +0x01c DpcCount         : Uint4B  As you can see, it keeps accounting information about DPCs. The data  is stored in the DpcData fi eld of the KPRCB structure associated with the  DPC. DpcListHead is the head entry in the DPC queue  it is set during  KPRCB initialization  and DpcLock is the spinlock protecting this struc- ture; each time a DPC is queued, the DpcCount and DpcQueueDepth are  incremented by one. See also KeInsertQueueDpc.  It can be instructive to  analyze KeInsertQueueDpc in assembly; pay attention to the KPRCB access  and head tail list insertion.  The DPC usage pattern in code is simple: Initialize the KDPC object with  KeInitializeDpc and queue it with KeInsertQueueDpc. When the processor  IRQL drops to DISPATCH_LEVEL, the kernel processes all DPCs in that queue.  As mentioned earlier, each CPU core keeps its own queue of DPCs. This queue   is tracked by the per-core KPRCB structure:  0: kd> dt nt!_KPRCB    +0x000 MxCsr            : Uint4B    +0x004 LegacyNumber     : UChar    +0x005 ReservedMustBeZero : UChar    +0x006 InterruptRequest : UChar    ...    +0x2d80 DpcData          : [2] _KDPC_DATA    +0x2dc0 DpcStack         : Ptr64 Void    +0x2dc8 MaximumDpcQueueDepth : Int4B    +0x2dcc DpcRequestRate   : Uint4B    +0x2dd0 MinimumDpcRate   : Uint4B    +0x2dd4 DpcLastCount     : Uint4B    +0x2dd8 ThreadDpcEnable  : UChar    +0x2dd9 QuantumEnd       : UChar    +0x2dda DpcRoutineActive : UChar 0: kd> dt nt!_KDPC_DATA    +0x000 DpcListHead      : _LIST_ENTRY    +0x010 DpcLock          : Uint8B    +0x018 DpcQueueDepth    : Int4B    +0x01c DpcCount         : Uint4B  The two notable fi elds are DpcData and DpcStack. DpcData is an array of  KDPC_DATA structures whereby each element tracks a DPC queue; the fi rst ele- ment tracks normal DPCs and the second tracks threaded DPCs. The function  KeInsertQueueDpc simply inserts the DPC into one of these two queues. The  relationship can be illustrated as shown in Figure 3-7.  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 137   138   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel  KPRCB  …  DpcData[0]  KDPC  Type  …  KDPC  Type  …  KDPC  Type  …  DpcData[1]  DpcListEntry  DpcListEntry  DpcListEntry  …  DeferredRoutine  DeferredRoutine  DeferredRoutine  …  …  …  Figure 3-7  stack.  DpcStack is a pointer to a block of memory to be used as the DPC routine’s   Windows has several mechanisms to process the DPC queue. The fi rst mecha- nism is through KiIdleLoop. While “idling,” it checks the PRCB to determine  if DPCs are waiting and if so to call KiRetireDpcList to process all DPCs. This  is why sometimes these two functions appear on the stack while executing a  DPC. For example:  0: kd> kn   Child-SP          RetAddr           Call Site 00 fffff800`00b9cc88 fffff800`028db5dc USBPORT!USBPORT_IsrDpc 01 fffff800`00b9cc90 fffff800`028d86fa nt!KiRetireDpcList+0x1bc 02 fffff800`00b9cd40 00000000`00000000 nt!KiIdleLoop+0x5a  The second mechanism occurs when the CPU is at DISPATCH_LEVEL. Consider   the following stack:  0: kd> kn  Child-SP          RetAddr           Call Site 00 fffff800`00ba2ef8 fffff800`028db5dc USBPORT!USBPORT_IsrDpc 01 fffff800`00ba2f00 fffff800`028d6065 nt!KiRetireDpcList+0x1bc 02 fffff800`00ba2fb0 fffff800`028d5e7c nt!KyRetireDpcList+0x5 03 fffff880`04ac67a0 fffff800`0291b793 nt!KiDispatchInterruptContinue 04 fffff880`04ac67d0 fffff800`028cbda2 nt!KiDpcInterruptBypass+0x13 05 fffff880`04ac67e0 fffff960`0002992c nt!KiInterruptDispatch+0x212 06 fffff880`04ac6978 fffff960`000363b3 win32k!vAlphaPerPixelOnly+0x7c 07 fffff880`04ac6980 fffff960`00035fa4 win32k!AlphaScanLineBlend+0x303 08 fffff880`04ac6a40 fffff960`001fd4f9 win32k!EngAlphaBlend+0x4f4 09 fffff880`04ac6cf0 fffff960`001fdbaa win32k!NtGdiUpdateTransform+0x112d 0a fffff880`04ac6db0 fffff960`001fdd19 win32k!NtGdiUpdateTransform+0x17de 0b fffff880`04ac6ed0 fffff960`001fded8 win32k!EngNineGrid+0xb1 0c fffff880`04ac6f70 fffff960`001fe395 win32k!EngDrawStream+0x1a0  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 138      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   139  0d fffff880`04ac7020 fffff960`001fece7 win32k!NtGdiDrawStreamInternal+0x47d 0e fffff880`04ac70d0 fffff960`0021a480 win32k!GreDrawStream+0x917 0f fffff880`04ac72c0 fffff800`028cf153 win32k!NtGdiDrawStream+0x9c 10 fffff880`04ac7420 000007fe`fd762cda nt!KiSystemServiceCopyEnd+0x13  This long stack indicates that win32k.sys was handling some graphics operation  request from the user, and then the USB port driver’s DPC routine—which has  nothing to do with win32k—is executed. What probably happened is that while  win32k.sys was handling the request, a device interrupt occurred that caused  the CPU to operate at device IRQL; and then the IRQL is eventually lowered to  DISPATCH_LEVEL, which causes the DPC queue to be processed.  The third mechanism is through a system thread created during processor  initialization. KiStartDpcThread creates a thread  KiExecuteDpc  for each pro- cessor, which processes the DPC queue whenever it runs. For example:  0: kd> kn   Child-SP          RetAddr           Call Site 00 fffff880`03116be8 fffff800`028aadb0 nt!KiDpcWatchdog 01 fffff880`03116bf0 fffff800`028aac4b nt!KiExecuteAllDpcs+0x148 02 fffff880`03116cb0 fffff800`02b73166 nt!KiExecuteDpc+0xcb 03 fffff880`03116d00 fffff800`028ae486 nt!PspSystemThreadStartup+0x5a 04 fffff880`03116d40 00000000`00000000 nt!KiStartSystemThread+0x16  Recall that the thread dispatcher runs at DISPATCH_LEVEL, and code running  at this IRQL cannot be interrupted by other software IRQLs  i.e., those below  DISPATCH_LEVEL . In other words, if there is an infi nite loop in the DPC routine,  the processor associated with it will spin forever and the system will practically  “freeze”; in a multi-processor system, it may not freeze but the processor executing  the DPC will not be usable by the thread dispatcher. In addition, the DPC routine  cannot wait on any kind of dispatcher objects because the dispatcher itself oper- ates at DISPATCH_LEVEL; this is why functions such as KeWaitForSingleObject  and KeDelayExecutionThread cannot be called in DPC routines.  N O T E  Windows has a DPC watchdog routine that detects DPCs run- ning over a certain time period and bugchecks with code DPC_WATCHDOG_ VIOLATION  0x133 . You can query the watchdog timer value by calling  KeQueryDpcWatchdogInformation.  Some rootkits use DPCs to synchronize access to global linked lists. For  example, they may remove an entry from the ActiveProcessLinks list to hide  processes; because this list can be modifi ed at any time by any processor, some  rootkit authors use a DPC along with another synchronization mechanism to  safely operate on it. In one of the exercises, you will be asked to explain why  some authors succeed at this while others fail  machine bugchecks .  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 139   140   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel  Exercises    1.  Where and when is the DpcData fi eld in KPRCB initialized?   2.  Write a driver to enumerate all DPCs on the entire system. Make sure  you support multi-processor systems! Explain the diffi culties and how  you solved them.    3.  Explain how the KiDpcWatchdog routine works.  Timers Timers are used to signal the expiration of a certain amount of time, which can  be periodically or at some time in the future. Optionally, the timer can also be  associated with a DPC. For example, if a driver wants to check the status of a  device every fi ve minutes or execute a routine 10 minutes in the future, it can  achieve this by using timers.  Concretely speaking, a timer is defi ned by the KTIMER structure:  Timer-related structures  0: kd> dt nt!_KPRCB ...       +0x2dfc InterruptRate    : Uint4B    +0x2e00 TimerTable       : _KTIMER_TABLE 0: kd> dt nt!_KTIMER_TABLE    +0x000 TimerExpiry      : [64] Ptr64 _KTIMER    +0x200 TimerEntries     : [256] _KTIMER_TABLE_ENTRY 0: kd> dt nt!_KTIMER    +0x000 Header           : _DISPATCHER_HEADER    +0x018 DueTime          : _ULARGE_INTEGER    +0x020 TimerListEntry   : _LIST_ENTRY    +0x030 Dpc              : Ptr64 _KDPC    +0x038 Processor        : Uint4B    +0x03c Period           : Uint4B 0: kd> dt nt!_KTIMER_TABLE_ENTRY    +0x000 Lock             : Uint8B    +0x008 Entry            : _LIST_ENTRY    +0x018 Time             : _ULARGE_INTEGER  Timer-related routines  VOID KeInitializeTimer    _Out_  PKTIMER Timer  ;  BOOLEAN KeSetTimer    _Inout_   PKTIMER Timer,  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 140      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   141    _In_      LARGE_INTEGER DueTime,   _In_opt_  PKDPC Dpc  ;  BOOLEAN KeSetTimerEx    _Inout_   PKTIMER Timer,   _In_      LARGE_INTEGER DueTime,   _In_      LONG Period,   _In_opt_  PKDPC Dpc  ;  It is initialized by calling KeInitializeTimer, which simply fi lls out some of  the basic fi elds. After initialization, the timer can be set through either KeSetTimer  or KeSetTimerEx. The difference between the two is that KeSetTimerEx can be  used to set a recurring timer  i.e., expire every X time unit . Note that these  functions can optionally take a DPC object, which is executed when the timer  expires. When calling these routines, the timer is inserted into a timer table  in the PRCB  TimerTable->TimerListEntry . Once set and queued, a timer  may be cancelled and hence removed from the timer table. This is done by the  KeCancelTimer API.  How does the system know when a timer expires? On every clock interrupt,  the system updates its runtime and checks the timer list to see if there are any  expiring entries; if there are, it requests a DPC interrupt that will process the  entries. Hence, timers are also processed at DISPATCH_LEVEL.  There are many examples showing how timers are used in the operating system.  For example, the system has a periodic timer that synchronizes the system time  and checks if the license is expiring  see ExpTimeRefreshDpcRoutine . There is  even a timer that expires at the end of a century  see ExpCenturyDpcRoutine .  Exercises    1.  Write a driver to enumerate the loaded module list every 10 minutes.   2.  Write a driver to enumerate all timers on the system. Make sure you sup- port multi-core systems. Explain why the DPC data associated with the  timer does not seem to make sense.    3.  Explain the DpcWatchDogTimer fi eld in the PRCB.   4.  Write a driver that sets a timer with an associated DPC. Explain the sequence  of calls leading to DPC execution. You may be interested in the following  functions: KeUpdateRuntime, KeAccumulateTicks, KiTimerExpiration,  KiRetireDpcList, and KiExpireTimerTable.    5.  Explain how timer insertion works. You will need to look at the function   KiInsertTimerTable.  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 141   142   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel  Process and Thread Callbacks A driver can register callbacks for a variety of events. Two of the most com- mon callbacks are related to processes and threads, and they can be regis- tered through documented APIs such as PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine,  PsSetCreateThreadNotifyRoutine, and PsSetLoadImageNotifyRoutine. How  do they work?  During system initialization, the kernel calls the function PspInitializeCallbacks  to  initialize  three  global  arrays:  P s p C r e a t e T h r e a d N o t i f y R o u t i n e,  PspCreateProcessNotifyRoutine, and PspLoadImageNotifyRoutine. When  the driver registers a process, thread, or image callback, it is stored in one of  these arrays. In addition, there is a global fl ag, PspNotifyEnableMask, which  determines what notifi cation types are enabled disabled. In the thread initial- ization and termination paths  PspInsertThread and PspExitThread, respec- tively , it checks whether the PspNotifyEnableMask fl ag is present and invokes  the callbacks accordingly.  These callbacks are primarily provided for drivers and hence are not explicitly  used by the kernel. For example, many anti-virus software products register  these callbacks to monitor system behavior. Kernel-mode rootkits sometimes  use them in conjunction with APCs to inject code into new processes.  Exercises    1.  This section provided a general explanation of how process, thread, and  image notify callbacks are implemented. Investigate the following func- tions and explain how they work:     PsSetCreateThreadNotifyRoutine     PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine     PsSetLoadImageNotifyRoutine     PspInitializeCallbacks    2.  If you did exercise 1, write a driver that enumerates all process, thread,   and image notify routines on the system and remove them.    3.  If you did exercise 1, explain two major weaknesses of these notifi cation  callbacks. For example, can you create new processes threads without  being detected by these callbacks? Implement your idea and evaluate its  effectiveness. Note: It is possible.    4.  If you register an image load callback with PsSetLoadImageNotifyRoutine,  under what condition is it called? Identify one weakness and implement  your idea. Hint: You may need to consult the PE specifi cation.  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 142      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   143    5.  The PsSetCreateThreadNotifyRoutine, PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine,  and PsSetLoadImageNotifyRoutine APIs are exposed by the process man- ager. However, the object and confi guration managers also expose their  own callbacks through ObRegisterCallbacks and CmRegisterCallback,  respectively. Investigate how these callbacks are implemented.    6.  Identify other similar callbacks documented in the WDK and investigate   how they work  processor, memory, and so on .  Completion Routines The Windows I O model is that of a device stack, whereby devices are lay- ered on top of each other, with each layer implementing some specifi c func- tion. This means that higher-level drivers can pass requests to lower ones for  processing. Whichever layer completes the requests marks it done by calling  IoCompleteRequest. Completion routines are used to notify drivers that their  I O request has been completed  or that it was cancelled or failed . They run in  arbitrary thread context and can be set through the IoSetCompletionRoutine Ex  APIs. IoSetCompletionRoutine is documented in WDK, but it will never appear  in an assembly listing or import table because it is forced-inline; one method to  identify the IoSetCompletion routine is to see the CompletionRoutine fi eld in  an IO_STACK_LOCATION  see the next section  modifi ed: Structure deﬁ nition  0: kd> dt nt!_IO_STACK_LOCATION    +0x000 MajorFunction    : UChar    +0x001 MinorFunction    : UChar    +0x002 Flags            : UChar    +0x003 Control          : UChar    +0x008 Parameters       :      +0x028 DeviceObject     : Ptr64 _DEVICE_OBJECT    +0x030 FileObject       : Ptr64 _FILE_OBJECT    +0x038 CompletionRoutine : Ptr64     long    +0x040 Context          : Ptr64 Void  Function deﬁ nition  VOID IoSetCompletionRoutine      _In_ PIRP Irp,     _In_opt_ PIO_COMPLETION_ROUTINE CompletionRoutine,     _In_opt_ __drv_aliasesMem PVOID Context,     _In_ BOOLEAN InvokeOnSuccess,     _In_ BOOLEAN InvokeOnError,     _In_ BOOLEAN InvokeOnCancel       {     PIO_STACK_LOCATION irpSp;  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 143   144   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel      irpSp = IoGetNextIrpStackLocation Irp ;     irpSp->CompletionRoutine = CompletionRoutine;     irpSp->Context = Context;     irpSp->Control = 0;     if  InvokeOnSuccess  {         irpSp->Control = SL_INVOKE_ON_SUCCESS;     }     if  InvokeOnError  {         irpSp->Control = SL_INVOKE_ON_ERROR;     }     if  InvokeOnCancel  {         irpSp->Control = SL_INVOKE_ON_CANCEL;     } }  The I O manager calls the registered completion routine as part of   IopfCompleteRequest.   Although the legitimate use of completion routines is obvious, rootkits may use  them for nefarious purposes. For example, they can set a completion routine to  modify the return buffer from a lower driver before it is returned to user mode.    1.  Write a test driver using a completion routine and determine where it is   Exercise  called from.  I O Request Packets  Windows uses I O request packets  IRPs  to describe I O requests to kernel- mode components  like drivers . When a user-mode application calls an API to  request data, the I O manager builds an IRP to describe the request and deter- mines which device to send the IRP to for processing. From the time an IRP is  created until its completion by a driver, it may have passed through multiple  devices, and additional IRPs could have been created to fulfi ll the request. One  can think of IRPs as the fundamental unit of communication between devices  for I O requests. An IRP is defi ned in WDK headers by the partially opaque IRP  structure, but most fi elds are undocumented  hence partially opaque :  0: kd> dt nt!_IRP    +0x000 Type             : Int2B ...  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 144      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   145     +0x042 StackCount       : Char    +0x043 CurrentLocation  : Char ...       +0x058 Overlay          :      +0x068 CancelRoutine    : Ptr64     void    +0x070 UserBuffer       : Ptr64 Void    +0x078 Tail             :    From a programming perspective, an IRP can be divided into two areas: static  and dynamic. The static part is an IRP structure with basic information about  the request such as who requested the operation  kernel or user , requesting  thread, and data passed in from the user. The Overlay and Tail fi elds are unions  containing metadata about the request. The dynamic part is immediately after  the header; it is an array of IO_STACK_LOCATION structures containing device- specifi c request information. An IO_STACK_LOCATION contains the IRP’s major  and minor function, parameters for the request, and an optional completion  routine. Similar to IRP, it is a partially opaque structure:  0: kd> dt nt!_IO_STACK_LOCATION    +0x000 MajorFunction    : UChar    +0x001 MinorFunction    : UChar    +0x002 Flags            : UChar    +0x003 Control          : UChar    +0x008 Parameters       :      +0x028 DeviceObject     : Ptr64 _DEVICE_OBJECT    +0x030 FileObject       : Ptr64 _FILE_OBJECT    +0x038 CompletionRoutine : Ptr64     long    +0x040 Context          : Ptr64 Void  The Parameters fi eld is a union because the parameter depends on the major  and minor function number. Windows has a predefi ned list of generic major and  minor functions to describe all request types. For example, a fi le read request  will lead to an IRP created with the major function IRP_MJ_READ; when Windows  requests input from the keyboard class driver, it also uses IRP_MJ_READ. When  the I O manager creates an IRP, it determines how many IO_STACK_LOCATION  structures to allocate based on how many devices there are in the current  device stack. Each device is responsible for preparing the IO_STACK_LOCATION  for the next one. Recall that a driver can set a completion routine with the  IoSetCompletionRoutine API; this is actually an inlined routine that sets the  CompletionRoutine fi eld in the IO_STACK_LOCATION.  Figure 3-8 illustrates the relationship between these two structures   in an IRP.  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 145   146   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel  …  …  …  …  Static Port  IRP  StackCount  Tail.Overlay.CurrentStackLocation  IO_STACK_LOCATION  IO_STACK_LOCATION  IO_STACK_LOCATION  IO_STACK_LOCATION  “next” IRP stack location  IO_STACK_LOCATION  IO_STACK_LOCATION  “current” IRP stack location  …  an IO request packet  relationship between IRP and IO_STACK_LOCATION  in an IO request packet  Dynamic Port  Figure 3-8  Note that the “next” stack location is the element immediately above the “cur- rent” one  not after it . This is important to know because stack location routines  such as IoGetCurrentIrpStackLocation, IoSkipCurrentIrpStackLocation,  IoGetNextIrpStackLocation, and others are simply returning pointers to these  array elements using pointer arithmetic.  Although IRPs are typically generated by the I O manager in response to  requests from users or other devices, they may also be created from scratch  and sent to other devices for processing. A driver can allocate an IRP with  IoAllocateIrp, associate it with a thread, fi ll out the IRP major and minor  code, set up IO_STACK_LOCATION count size, fi ll in parameters, and send it to  the destination device for processing with IoCallDriver. Some rootkits use  this mechanism to directly send requests to the fi le system driver in order to  bypass system call hooking. You will analyze one such rootkit in the exercise.  Structure of a Driver  A driver is a piece of software that interacts with the kernel and or controls  hardware resources. While there are many different types of drivers, we are  primarily concerned with the following types of kernel-mode drivers:     Legacy software driver—Software that runs in ring 0 and interacts with  the kernel through documented and undocumented interfaces. Most  rootkits and security drivers are of this type.  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 146      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   147     Legacy fi lter driver—Drivers that attach to an existing driver and modify   its input.     File system minifi lter driver—Drivers that interact with the fi le system  to intercept fi le I O requests. Most anti-virus software uses this kind  of driver to intercept fi le writes reads for scanning purposes; on-disk  encryption software is typically implemented through this mechanism.  The standard model for Windows drivers is the Windows Driver Model   WDM . WDM defi nes both a set of interfaces that drivers must implement and  rules to follow in order to safely interact with the kernel. It has been defi ned  since Windows 2000 and all drivers you analyze are based on it. Because writ- ing reliable plug-and-play hardware drivers with full power management and  handling all the synchronization idiosyncrasies using pure WDM interfaces is  exceedingly diffi cult, Microsoft introduced the Windows Driver Foundation   WDF  framework. WDF is basically a set of libraries built on top of WDM that  simplifi es driver development by shielding developers from directly interacting  with WDM. WDF is divided into two categories: kernel-mode driver framework   KMDF  and user-mode driver framework  UMDF . KMDF is meant for kernel- mode drivers  such as keyboards and USB devices  and UMDF is for user-mode  drivers  such as printer drivers . This book deals only with drivers based on  the WDM model.  One can think of a driver as a DLL that is loaded into the kernel address  space and executes with the same privilege as the kernel. It has a well-defi ned  entry point and may register dispatch routines to service requests from users  or other drivers. Note that a driver does not have a main execution thread; it  simply contains code that can be called by the kernel under certain circum- stances. This is why drivers usually have to register dispatch routines with the  I O manager  see the next section . When analyzing drivers, the fi rst and most  important task is to identify these dispatch routines and understand how they  interact with the kernel.  Entry Points All drivers have an entry point called DriverEntry, which is defi ned as follows: DriverEntry NTSTATUS DriverEntry       PDRIVER_OBJECT DriverObject,     PUNICODE_STRING RegistryPath  ;  DRIVER_OBJECT  typedef struct _DRIVER_OBJECT {     CSHORT Type;  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 147   148   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel      CSHORT Size;     PDEVICE_OBJECT DeviceObject;     ULONG Flags;     PVOID DriverStart;     ULONG DriverSize;     PVOID DriverSection;     PDRIVER_EXTENSION DriverExtension;     UNICODE_STRING DriverName;     PUNICODE_STRING HardwareDatabase;     PFAST_IO_DISPATCH FastIoDispatch;     PDRIVER_INITIALIZE DriverInit;     PDRIVER_STARTIO DriverStartIo;     PDRIVER_UNLOAD DriverUnload;     PDRIVER_DISPATCH MajorFunction[IRP_MJ_MAXIMUM_FUNCTION + 1]; } DRIVER_OBJECT, *PDRIVER_OBJECT;  N O T E  Technically, the entry point does not have to be named DriverEntry.  When a driver needs to be loaded, its image is mapped into kernel space  memory, a driver object is created for it and registered with the object manager,  and then the I O manager calls the entry point. DRIVER_OBJECT is a structure  fi lled out by the I O manager during the driver loading process; the offi cial  documentation indicates that it is a partially opaque structure, but one can  view its full defi nition in the header fi les. DriverInit is set to the driver’s entry  point and the I O manager directly calls this fi eld. The primary responsibility  of DriverEntry is to initialize driver-specifi c settings and register IRP dispatch  routines as necessary. These routines are stored in the MajorFunction array. As  previously mentioned, Windows has a pre-defi ned set of IRP major functions to  generically describe every I O request; whenever an I O request comes in for  the driver, the I O manager calls the appropriate IRP major function handler  to process the request. Hence, it is common to see code like the following in  DriverEntry:  DriverObject->MajorFunction[IRP_MJ_CREATE] = CreateCloseHandler; DriverObject->MajorFunction[IRP_MJ_CLOSE] = CreateCloseHandler; DriverObject->MajorFunction[IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL] = DeviceControlHandler; ...  Note that the same dispatch routine can be specifi ed for multiple IRP major   functions. Sometimes they will be initialized in a loop:  for  i=0; i<IRP_MJ_MAXIMUM; i++  {     DriverObject->MajorFunction[i] = GenericHandler; } DriverObject->MajorFunction[IRP_MJ_CREATE] = CreateHandler; DriverObject->MajorFunction[IRP_MJ_PNP] = PnpHandler; ...  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 148      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   149  If you do not initialize the MajorFunction table, it will contain the default han- dler IopInvalidDeviceRequest, which simply returns an error to the requestor. If a driver supports dynamic unloading, it must also fi ll out the DriverUnload  fi eld; otherwise, the driver will remain in memory forever  until reboot . A  DriverUnload routine typically performs driver-specifi c cleanup tasks. Many  rootkits do not register an unload routine.  RegistryPath is the registry path for the driver. It is created as part of the   normal driver installation process.  Driver and Device Objects The previous section states that the I O manager creates a DRIVER_OBJECT for  every driver loaded in the system. A driver can choose to create one or more  device objects. Device objects are defi ned by the partially opaque DEVICE_OBJECT  structure:  typedef struct _DEVICE_OBJECT {     CSHORT Type;     USHORT Size;     LONG ReferenceCount;     struct _DRIVER_OBJECT *DriverObject;     struct _DEVICE_OBJECT *NextDevice;     struct _DEVICE_OBJECT *AttachedDevice;     struct _IRP *CurrentIrp;     ...     PVOID DeviceExtension;     DEVICE_TYPE DeviceType;     CCHAR StackSize;     ...     ULONG ActiveThreadCount;     PSECURITY_DESCRIPTOR SecurityDescriptor;     ...     PVOID Reserved; } DEVICE_OBJECT, *PDEVICE_OBJECT;  DriverObject is the driver object associated with this device object. If the  driver created more than one device object, then NextDevice will point to the  next device object in the chain. A driver may create multiple device objects to  manage different hardware resources it is handling. If no device objects are cre- ated, then no one can send requests to the device. Typically, drivers will create  device objects in DriverEntry through the IoCreateDevice API.  DeviceExtension is a pointer to device-specifi c data stored in non-paged pool.  Its size is specifi ed as a parameter to IoCreateDevice. Developers typically  store context information or important data about the driver and other related  devices here. Recovering the device extension structure is probably the second  most important task in the analysis of drivers.  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 149   150   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel  A driver can “attach” one of its own device objects to another device object so  that it receives I O requests intended for the target device object. For example,  if device A attaches to device B, then all IRP requests sent to B will be routed to  A fi rst. This attaching mechanism is used to support fi lter drivers so that they  can modify inspect requests to other drivers. The AttachedDevice fi eld points  to the device to which the current device object is attached. Device attaching is  done through the IoAttachDevice API family.  IRP Handling As mentioned earlier, DriverEntry typically registers dispatch routines to  handle various IRP major functions. The prototype for these dispatch routines  is as follows:  NTSTATUS XXX_Dispatch       PDEVICE_OBJECT *DeviceObject,     PIRP *Irp  ;  The fi rst argument is the request’s target device object. The second argument   is the IRP describing the request.  A dispatch routine typically fi rst determines what IRP major function it  received and then determines the request’s parameters. It does so by checking  the IO_STACK_LOCATION in the IRP. If the dispatch routine successfully com- pletes the request, it calls IoCompleteRequest and returns. If it cannot complete  the request, then it has three options: return an error, pass the IRP to another  driver, or pend the IRP. For example, a fi lter driver may choose to process only  IRP_MJ_READ requests itself and pass all other requests to the attached device.  A driver can pass IRPs to another driver through the IoCallDriver API.  Because IRP parameters for each request are stored in their own IO_STACK_ LOCATION, a driver must ensure that it is accessing the right location. This is done  through the IoGetCurrentIrpStackLocation API. If the driver wants to pass  the same IRP to another driver, it has to either copy the current parameters to  the next IO_STACK_LOCATION  IoCopyCurrentIrpStackLocationToNext  or pass  the parameter to the next driver  IoSkipCurrentStackLocation .  A Common Mechanism for User-Kernel Communication Many mechanisms are used to facilitate user-kernel communication. For example,  a driver can communicate with user-mode code through a shared memory region  double-mapped in user and kernel space. Another method is for the driver to  create an event that a user-mode thread can wait on; the event state can be used  as a trigger for further action. Yet another  although hackish  method is through  interrupt handling. A driver can manually set up a custom interrupt handler   c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 150      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   151  in the IDT and user-mode code can trigger it with the INT instruction; you will  probably never see this technique used in a commercial driver.  While the precise communication mechanism depends on the developer’s  ultimate goal, a generic documented interface is typically used for user-kernel  data exchange. This mechanism is supported by the IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL  operation and commonly referred to as device I O control or simply IOCTL. It  works as follows:   1.  The driver defi nes one or more IOCTL codes for each operation it supports.   2.  For each supported operation, the driver specifi es how it should access  the user input and return data to the user. There are three access methods:  buffered I O, direct I O, and neither. These methods are covered in the  next section.    3.  Inside the IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL handler, the driver retrieves the IOCTL  code from its IO_STACK_LOCATION and processes the data based on the  input method.  User-mode  code  can  request  these  IOCTL  operations  through  the   DeviceIoControl API.  Buﬀ  ering Methods  A driver can access a user-mode buffer using one of the following three methods:    Buffered I O—This is referred to as METHOD_BUFFERED in the kernel. When  using this method, the kernel validates the user buffer to be in accessible  user-mode memory, allocates a block of memory in non-paged pool, and  copies the user buffer to it. The driver accesses this kernel-mode buffer  through the AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer fi eld in the IRP structure.  While processing the request, the driver may modify the system buffer   perhaps it needs to return some data back to the user ; after completing  the request, the kernel copies the system buffer’s content back to the user- mode buffer and automatically frees the system buffer.     Direct IO—This is referred to as METHOD_IN_DIRECT or METHOD_OUT_DIRECT  in the kernel. The former is used for passing data to the driver; the latter  is used for getting data from the driver. This method is similar to buffered  I O except that the driver gets an MDL describing the user buffer. The  I O manager creates the MDL and locks it in memory before passing it  to the driver. Drivers can access this MDL through the MdlAddress fi eld  of the IRP structure.     Neither—This is referred to as METHOD_NEITHER in the kernel. When using  this method, the I O manager does not perform any kind of validation  on the user data; it passes the raw data to the driver. Drivers can access  the data through the Parameters.DeviceIoControl.Type3InputBuffer   c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 151   152   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel  fi eld in its IO_STACK_LOCATION. While this method may seem the fastest  of the three  as there is no validation or mapping of additional buffers ,  it is certainly the most insecure one. It leaves all the validation to the  developer. Without proper validation, a driver using this method may  expose itself to security vulnerabilities such as kernel memory corruption  or leakage disclosure.  There is no written rule for determining which method to use in drivers  because it depends on the driver’s specifi c requirements. However, in practice,  most software drivers use buffered I O because it provides a good balance  between simplicity and security. Direct I O is common in hardware drivers  because it can be used to pass large data chunks without buffering overhead.  I O Control Code  An IOCTL code is a 32-bit integer that encodes the device type, operation-specifi c  code, buffering method, and security access. Drivers usually defi ne IOCTL codes  through the CTL_CODE macro:  define CTL_CODE  DeviceType, Function, Method, Access                     \       DeviceType  << 16     Access  << 14     Function  << 2    Method  \    DeviceType is usually one of the FILE_DEVICE_* constants, but for third-party  drivers it can use anything above 0x8000.  This is only the recommended value  and there is nothing enforcing it.  Access specifi es generic read write operations  allowed by the IOCTL; it can be a combination of FILE_ANY_ACCESS, FILE_READ_ ACCESS, and FILE_WRITE_ACCESS. Function is the driver-specifi c IOCTL code;  it can be anything above 0x800. Method specifi es one of the buffering methods.  A typical way to defi ne an IOCTL code is as follows:  define FILE_DEVICE_GENIOCTL 0xa000    our device type define GENIOCTL_PROCESS     0x800     our special IOCTL code  define IOCTL_PROCESS CTL_CODE FILE_DEVICE_GENIOCTL, \                                     GENIOCTL_PROCESS, \                                    METHOD_BUFFERED, FILE_READ_DATA   This defi nes an IOCTL called IOCTL_PROCESS for a custom driver using   METHOD_BUFFERED.  When analyzing a driver, it is important to decompose the IOCTL down to  its device type, code, access, and buffering method. This can be achieved with  a couple of simple documented macros:  define DEVICE_TYPE_FROM_CTL_CODE ctrlCode  \                                  ULONG  ctrlCode & 0xffff0000   >> 16  define METHOD_FROM_CTL_CODE ctrlCode         ULONG  ctrlCode & 3   c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 152      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   153  Miscellaneous System Mechanisms This section discusses constructs that—while not essential to understanding  kernel drivers—are frequently observed in real-life drivers.  System Control Registers  In order to achieve their goals, many rootkit developers resort to hooking func- tions in the kernel. However, all kernel code is mapped as read-only, so patching  it will result in a bugcheck. On x86 x64, this protection mechanism is actually  enforced at the hardware level through a special control register: CR0. CR0 deter- mines several important processor settings, such as whether it is in protected  mode and whether paging is enabled; it also determines whether the CPU can  write to read-only pages  WP bit . CR0 is only accessible by code running in ring  0. By default, Windows turns on the WP bit, which prohibits writes to pages  marked read-only.  N O T E  On x64 and ARM, there is a Windows feature called Kernel Patch Protection,  also known as PatchGuard, that tries to detect hooks and modiﬁ cations to various  security-critical data structures and bugchecks the machine. Hence, it is not common  to see hooks on these platforms in shipping production drivers. Nevertheless, hook- ing is still prevalent because there are many x86 machines out there, so you will fre- quently run into them.  There are several ways to bypass this restriction and the easiest one is to  toggle the WP bit. Hence, you will frequently see this code pattern in rootkits.  For example, Sample G:  01: .text:0001062F   push    eax 02: .text:00010630   mov     eax, cr0 03: .text:00010633   mov     [esp+8+var_4], eax 04: .text:00010637   and     eax, 0FFFEFFFFh 05: .text:0001063C   mov     cr0, eax 06: .text:0001063F   pop     eax  Lines 2–3 copy CR0 to EAX and save it to a local variable. Lines 4–5 turn off the   bit 16 in EAX and write it back to CR0. Bit 16 in CR0 is the WP bit.  There are at least two other solutions that do not directly modify CR0. They  involve MDLs and knowledge of the platform MMU. You will be required to  do this as one of the exercises.  KeServiceDescriptorTable  As previously stated, many rootkits resort to hooking system calls. However,  as you learned, system calls are identifi ed by a number that is used as an index   c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 153   154   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel  into a syscall table. Furthermore, the system call table  KiServiceTable  is not  exported, so there is no easy way to access it from a driver. How do rootkit  authors get around this?  The kernel exports the KeServiceDescriptorTable symbol, which contains  a KSERVICE_TABLE_DESCRIPTOR structure with the system call information.   Recall that on x64, this symbol is not exported.  This is how most rootkits  access the system call table. The next step is to identify where the target system  call is located. Recall that system calls are identifi ed by a number, not by name.  Rootkit authors have several ways to fi nd the right system call. One way is to  hardcode the syscall index. Another method is to disassemble the system call  stub and get the index from there. Both of these methods have a trade-off: They  are simple to implement, but they rely on code or data patterns that may change  from service pack to service pack; they may be reliable on some platforms, but  will certainly lead to system instability on others. Despite the unreliability,  these two methods are frequently used by rootkits in the wild. For example,  Sample G has the following code:  01: .text:000117D4 sub_117D4 proc near 02: .text:000117D4   push    ebp 03: .text:000117D5   mov     ebp, esp 04: .text:000117D7   push    ecx 05: .text:000117D8   mov     ecx, ds:KeServiceDescriptorTable 06: .text:000117DE   mov     ecx, [ecx] 07: .text:000117E0   push    esi 08: .text:000117E1   mov     esi, ds:ZwQuerySystemInformation 09: ... 10: .text:00011808   call    DisableWP 11: .text:0001180D   mov     ecx, ds:KeServiceDescriptorTable 12: .text:00011813   mov     eax, [esi+1] 13: .text:00011816   mov     ecx, [ecx] 14: .text:00011818   mov     dword ptr [ecx+eax*4], offset sub_1123E 15: ... 16: .text:00011836 sub_117D4 endp  Lines 5–10 save the address of KiServiceTable in ECX, save the address of  ZwQuerySystemInformation in ESI, and disable the WP bit. Line 12 retrieves the  second byte from ZwQuerySystemInformation; it does this because it assumes  that the fi rst instruction in the function moves the syscall number to a register  and hence the 32-bit value after the opcode contains the actual syscall number   see the following sidebar . Lines 13–14 overwrite that syscall entry in the service  table with a new function: sub_1123e. All calls to ZwQuerySystemInformation  will now be redirected to sub_1123e.  N O T E  We mentioned earlier that line 12 retrieves the second byte from  ZwQuerySystemInformation. On 32-bit Windows 7, the ﬁ rst instruction in   c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 154      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   155  ZwQuerySystemInformation is b805010000 mov eax and 105h. b8 is the  MOV opcode, while 05010000  0x105  encodes the immediate, which in this case is the  syscall number.  Sections  A section is an object used to describe memory backed by some form of storage.  The section can be backed by a normal fi le or a page fi le. A fi le-backed section  is one for which the memory content is that of a fi le on disk; if there are modi- fi cations to the section, they will be made directly to disk. A page-fi le-backed  section is one whose content is backed by the page fi le; modifi cations to such  a section will be discarded after it is closed. A driver can create a section with  the ZwCreateSection API and then map a view of it into another process with  ZwMapViewOfSection. Each view is basically a virtual address range that can be  used to access the memory represented by the associated section object. Hence,  there can be multiple views for a section.  Walk-Throughs  Now that you have a strong grasp of Windows kernel and driver concepts, it is  time to apply that knowledge by analyzing some real-life rootkits. This section  serves two purposes: to explain the thinking process of kernel-mode reverse  engineering and to demonstrate the application of driver development tech- niques to understanding rootkits.   Rootkits come in many different forms. Some hook system calls, some hide  fi les by fi ltering I O responses, some intercept network communication, some  log keystrokes, and so on. However, like all drivers, they share the same generic  structure; for example, they all have a DriverEntry function with optional  IRP dispatch handlers that interface with the kernel through documented and  undocumented interfaces. With this knowledge, you can dissect core compo- nents of a driver and systematically analyze them. The general analysis process  is as follows:   1.  Identify DriverEntry and determine the IRP dispatch handlers, if any.   2.  Determine whether the driver attaches to another device to fi lter intercept   its I O requests. If so, what is the target device?    3.  If the driver creates a device object, determine the name and device exten-    4.  Recover the device extension structure by observing how its fi eld members   sion size.  are used.  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 155   156   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel    5.  If the driver supports IOCTL, identify all the IOCTL codes and their cor-  responding functionality. Determine what buffering method they use.    6.  Identify DPCs, work items, APCs, timers, completion routines, callbacks,   and system threads.    7.  Try to understand how all the pieces fi t together.  An x86 Rootkit The walk-through begins with Sample A.  Its DriverEntry starts at 0x105F0 and ends at 0x106AD. It fi rst initializes a  UNICODE_STRING structure with the strings \Device\fsodhfn2m and \DosDevices\ fsodhfn2m. In kernel mode, most strings are described using the UNICODE_STRING  structure:  typedef struct _UNICODE_STRING {   USHORT  Length;   USHORT  MaximumLength;   PWSTR  Buffer; } UNICODE_STRING, *PUNICODE_STRING;  It is initialized through the RtlInitUnicodeString API. The “Device” string  is a device name in the object manager; the “DosDevices” string is used as a  symbolic link to the actual device name. The Windows object manager main- tains and organizes objects in a fi lesystem-like structure with the root at “\”.  There are well-defi ned directories such as \Devices, \BaseNamedObjects, \ KernelObjects, and so on. \DosDevices is an alias for the \?? directory; it is  there because when user-mode applications specify the path to an object they  want to access, the \??\ is prepended to it; \?? contains symbolic links point- ing to the real object. For example, when a user wants to access “c:\test.txt”  through the CreateFile API, the actual path sent to the kernel is “\??\c:\ test.txt”; because “c:” is a symbolic link to \Device\HarddiskVolume2  it  may vary on your system , the whole path will eventually resolve to \Device\ HarddiskVolume2\test.txt. The symbolic link is necessary because user-mode  APIs usually access devices through the \?? directory; if there were no symbolic  links there, the device may not be accessible to user-mode apps.  After initializing the two strings, it proceeds to create the actual device object.   IoCreateDevice is defi ned as follows:  NTSTATUS    IoCreateDevice      IN PDRIVER_OBJECT  DriverObject,     IN ULONG  DeviceExtensionSize,     IN PUNICODE_STRING  DeviceName  OPTIONAL,     IN DEVICE_TYPE  DeviceType,     IN ULONG  DeviceCharacteristics,  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 156      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   157      IN BOOLEAN  Exclusive,     OUT PDEVICE_OBJECT  *DeviceObject      ;  DriverObject is the caller’s DRIVER_OBJECT; it is the driver object that the new  device object is associated with. DeviceExtensionSize is how many bytes of non- paged pool memory should be allocated for the driver-specifi c structure. Because  it is a user-defi ned structure, it is very important to recover its fi elds. DeviceName  is the native device name. DeviceType is one of the pre-defi ned FILE_DEVICE_*  types; if the device does not fall into a generic category, FILE_DEVICE_UNKNOWN  is used instead. DeviceCharacteristics refers to the device characteristic;  most of the time you will see FILE_DEVICE_SECURE_OPEN. Exclusive determines  whether there can be more than one handle to the device. DeviceObject receives  the actual device object.  From the disassembly, you can decompile the fi rst basic block and its exiting   condition as follows:  01: UNICODE_STRING devname; 02: UNICODE_STRING symname; 03:  04: NTSTATUS DriverEntry PDRIVER_OBJECT DriverObject, \                          PUNICODE_STRING regpath  05: { 06:   NTSTATUS status; 07:   PDEVICE_OBJECT devobj; 08:  09:   RtlInitUnicodeString &devname, L"\\Device\\fsodhfn2m" ; 10:   RtlInitUnicodeString &symname, L"\\DosDevices\\fsodhfn2m" ; 11:   status = IoCreateDevice  12:                DriverObject, 13:                0, 14:                &devname, 15:                FILE_DEVICE_UNKNOWN, 16:                FILE_DEVICE_SECURE_OPEN, 17:                FALSE, 18:                &devobj ; 19:   if  !NT_SUCCESS status   { 20:     return status;    loc_106A3 21:   } 22: }  NT_SUCCESS   is a common macro that checks if status is greater than or   equal to 0. After successfully creating the object, it proceeds to the following:  01: .text:00010643   mov     ecx, [ebp+DriverObject] 02: .text:00010646   mov     dword ptr [ecx+38h], offset sub_10300 03: .text:0001064D   mov     edx, [ebp+DriverObject] 04: .text:00010650   mov     dword ptr [edx+40h], offset sub_10300 05: .text:00010657   mov     eax, [ebp+DriverObject] 06: .text:0001065A   mov     dword ptr [eax+70h], offset sub_10300  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 157   158   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel  07: .text:00010661   mov     ecx, [ebp+DriverObject] 08: .text:00010664   mov     dword ptr [ecx+34h], offset sub_10580 09: .text:0001066B   push    offset SymbolicLinkName  ; SymbolicLinkName 10: .text:00010670   call    ds:IoDeleteSymbolicLink 11: .text:00010676   push    offset DestinationString ; DeviceName 12: .text:0001067B   push    offset SymbolicLinkName  ; SymbolicLinkName 13: .text:00010680   call    ds:IoCreateSymbolicLink 14: .text:00010686   mov     [ebp+var_4], eax 15: .text:00010689   cmp     [ebp+var_4], 0 16: .text:0001068D   jge     short loc_106A1  Lines 1–8 set some DRIVER_OBJECT fi elds to two function pointers.

Offset 0x38 is  the beginning of the MajorFunction array; recall that this is an array of IRP  dispatch handlers. Because there is a maximum of 28 generic IRP major func- tions, the MajorFunction array has 28 members. The fi rst index is 0, which  corresponds to IRP_MJ_CREATE; hence, you know that sub_10300 is the handler  for that IRP. Offset 0x40 is the third element in the MajorFunction array  index  2 ; this corresponds to IRP_MJ_CLOSE, and sub_10300 is reused as the handler.  Offset 0x70 is the 16th element in the array  index 0xe , which corresponds to  IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL, and sub_10300 is the handler. At this point, you know  that sub_10300 is the handler for the read, close, and device control IRP.  Lines 10–13 delete any existing symbolic link and create a new one to point   to the device object previously created.  You can now continue decompiling this block in DriverEntry as follows:  01: DriverObject->MajorFunction[IRP_MJ_READ] = sub_10300; 02: DriverObject->MajorFunction[IRP_MJ_CLOSE] = sub_10300; 03: DriverObject->MajorFunction[IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL] = sub_10300; 04: DriverObject->DriverUnload = sub_10580; 05:  06: IoDeleteSymbolicLink &symname ; 07: status = IoCreateSymbolicLink &symname, &devname ; 08: if  !NT_SUCCESS status   { 09:   ...    block .text:0001068F 10:   return status;   c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 158      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   159  11: } 12: return status;  To make life easier, you can rename sub_10300 as IRP_ReadCloseDeviceIo   and sub_10580 as DRV_Unload.  The next block at 0x1068F deletes the previously created device object if the  symbolic link creation fails. Note that it is getting the device object from the  driver object instead of using the pointer passed to IoCreateDevice. You can  decompile this block as follows:  01: IoDeleteDevice DriverObject->DeviceObject ;  That completes decompilation of this rootkit’s DriverEntry. To summarize   what has been learned so far:     The driver creates a device object named \Device\fsodhfn2m.    It supports dynamic unloading and the unload routine is sub_10580    renamed to DRV_Unload .     It supports IRP_MJ_READ, IRP_MJ_WRITE, and IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL opera- tions, and sub_10300 is the handler  renamed to IRP_ReadCloseDeviceIo .    It creates a symbolic link to the device object. If that fails, the driver returns   an error.  The next step is to understand what the DriverUnload routine does. The WDK   defi nes the prototype for the driver unload routine as follows:  VOID  Unload      PDRIVER_OBJECT  *DriverObject      ;  After some minor massaging, our unload routine looks like this:  01: .text:00010580 ; void __stdcall DRV_Unload PDRIVER_OBJECT drvobj  02: .text:00010580 DRV_Unload proc near 03: .text:00010580 04: .text:00010580 drvobj= dword ptr  8 05: .text:00010580 06: .text:00010580   push    ebp 07: .text:00010581   mov     ebp, esp 08: .text:00010583   push    offset SymbolicLinkName  ; SymbolicLinkName 09: .text:00010588   call    ds:IoDeleteSymbolicLink 10: .text:0001058E   mov     eax, [ebp+drvobj] 11: .text:00010591   mov     ecx, [eax+DRIVER_OBJECT.DeviceObject] 12: .text:00010594   push    ecx                      ; DeviceObject 13: .text:00010595   call    ds:IoDeleteDevice 14: .text:0001059B   pop     ebp 15: .text:0001059C   retn    4 16: .text:0001059C DRV_Unload endp  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 159   160   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel  The preceding can be decompiled to the following:  01: VOID DRV_Unload PDRIVER_OBJECT drvobj  02: { 03:   IoDeleteSymbolicLink &symname ; 04:   IoDeleteDevice drvobj->DeviceObject ; 05: }  As previously stated, an important key to understanding a driver’s functional- ity is through its IRP dispatch handlers. Analyzing _IRP_ReadCloseDeviceIo,  we start at the beginning:  01: .text:00010300 ; NTSTATUS __stdcall IRP_ReadCloseDeviceIO                         PDEVICE_OBJECT devobj, PIRP Irp  02: .text:00010300 IRP_ReadCloseDeviceIO proc near 03: .text:00010300 var_14= dword ptr -14h 04: .text:00010300 var_10= dword ptr -10h 05: .text:00010300 var_C= dword ptr -0Ch 06: .text:00010300 var_8= dword ptr -8 07: .text:00010300 var_4= dword ptr -4 08: .text:00010300 devobj= dword ptr  8 09: .text:00010300 Irp= dword ptr  0Ch 10: .text:00010300 11: .text:00010300   push    ebp 12: .text:00010301   mov     ebp, esp 13: .text:00010303   sub     esp, 14h 14: .text:00010306   mov     [ebp+var_4], 0 15: .text:0001030D   mov     eax, [ebp+Irp] 16: .text:00010310   mov     ecx, [ebp+var_4] 17: .text:00010313   mov     [eax+18h], ecx 18: .text:00010316   mov     edx, [ebp+Irp] 19: .text:00010319   mov     dword ptr [edx+1Ch], 0 20: .text:00010320   mov     eax, [ebp+Irp] 21: .text:00010323   mov     ecx, [eax+60h] 22: .text:00010326   mov     [ebp+var_10], ecx 23: .text:00010329   mov     edx, [ebp+var_10] 24: .text:0001032C   movzx   eax, byte ptr [edx] 25: .text:0001032F   cmp     eax, 0Eh 26: .text:00010332   jnz     short loc_1037D  We already know its prototype because it is the same for all IRP handlers.   When analyzing IRP handlers, you need to be cognizant of a few facts:     An IRP is a dynamic structure with an array of IO_STACK_LOCATION after   its header.     Most of the IRP parameters are in the IO_STACK_LOCATION  including its   IRP major minor number .     A driver accesses its IO_STACK_LOCATION using the IoGetCurrent IrpStacLocation routine. Because this routine is forced-inline, you must   c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 160      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   161  recognize it through its inlined patterns. It is a common coding pattern  to retrieve the IO_STACK_LOCATION in the beginning of an IRP handler.  Lines 15–17 read the IRP structure and write a 0 to a fi eld at offset 0x18.   Looking at the IRP structure you see the following:  0: kd> dt nt!_IRP    +0x000 Type             : Int2B    +0x002 Size             : Uint2B ...    +0x00c AssociatedIrp    :   ...    +0x018 IoStatus         : _IO_STATUS_BLOCK       +0x000 Status           : Int4B       +0x000 Pointer          : Ptr32 Void       +0x004 Information      : Uint4B ...     +0x020 RequestorMode    : Char ...    +0x040 Tail             :    typedef struct _IO_STATUS_BLOCK {   union {     NTSTATUS  Status;     PVOID  Pointer;   };   ULONG_PTR  Information; } IO_STATUS_BLOCK, *PIO_STATUS_BLOCK;  An IO_STATUS_BLOCK structure stores status information about an IRP:  An IRP handler typically sets the Status fi eld to indicate whether the IRP was  successful or requires further processing. Information stores request-specifi c  information for the IRP; a driver may use it to store a pointer to a buffer or set  the completion status. Pointer is reserved.  Hence, you know that line 17 sets the IRP->IoStatus.Status fi eld to 0 and  that the local variable var_4 is of type NTSTATUS. Lines 18–19 access the IRP  structure and write a 0 at offset 0x1c, which is the Information fi eld in IoStatus.  This is simply setting IRP->IoStatus.Information to 0. Lines 20–22 access  offset 0x60 in the IRP structure and save its address in a local variable. The IRP  structure is fi lled with unions in the Tail fi eld  starting at offset 0x40 , so it can  be somewhat confusing to determine which union fi eld member is accessed.  Let’s dump some of the unions:  0: kd> dt nt_IRP Tail.Overlay.    +0x040 Tail          :       +0x000 Overlay       :          +0x000 DeviceQueueEntry : _KDEVICE_QUEUE_ENTRY          +0x000 DriverContext : [4] Ptr32 Void  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 161   162   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel           +0x010 Thread        : Ptr32 _ETHREAD          +0x014 AuxiliaryBuffer : Ptr32 Char          +0x018 ListEntry     : _LIST_ENTRY          +0x020 CurrentStackLocation : Ptr32 _IO_STACK_LOCATION          +0x020 PacketType    : Uint4B          +0x024 OriginalFileObject : Ptr32 _FILE_OBJECT  This indicates that offset 0x60 could be either a pointer to an IO_STACK_ LOCATION or an unsigned integer indicating the packet type. We can make an  educated guess that it is the CurrentStackLocation fi eld because of the code  context  occurring at the beginning of an IRP handler . Furthermore, we know  that the inlined routine IoGetCurrentIrpStackLocation is defi ned as follows:  FORCEINLINE PIO_STACK_LOCATION IoGetCurrentIrpStackLocation PIRP Irp  {   return Irp->Tail.Overlay.CurrentStackLocation; }  Therefore, lines 20–22 are saving the current IO_STACK_LOCATION to a local   variable. The local variable _var_10 is of the type PIO_STACK_LOCATION.  N O T E  Many of these functions are declared as FORCEINLINE and thus  will never appear as call destinations—i.e., you will never see see the symbol  IoGetCurrentIrpStackLocation in the assembly code. We recommend that you  write a simple driver using these forced-inline routines so that you can get used to the  code pattern.  Lines 23–25 access the fi rst byte at offset 0 in the IO_STACK_LOCATION using  the MOVZX instruction. This indicates that fi eld is of type unsigned char. From  the IRP section, we know that this is the MajorFunction fi eld. Line 5 checks  whether the MajorFunction number is 0xe, i.e., IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL. You can now decompile the fi rst block of IRP_ReadCloseIo as follows:  NTSTATUS IRP_ReadCloseIo PDEVICE_OBJECT devobj, PIRP Irp  {   NTSTATUS status = STATUS_SUCCESS;   PIO_STACK_LOCATION isl;   Irp->IoStatus.Status = status;   Irp->IoStatus.Information = 0;    isl = IoGetCurrentIrpStackLocation Irp ;   if  isl->MajorFunction != IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL  {     ...    loc_1037D   }   ...    .text:00010334 }  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 162      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   163  Next, we analyze block 0x10334, which executes if major code is IRP_MJ  _DEVICE_CONTROL:  01: .text:00010334   mov     ecx, [ebp+var_10] 02: .text:00010337   mov     edx, [ecx+0Ch] 03: .text:0001033A   mov     [ebp+var_C], edx 04: .text:0001033D   mov     eax, [ebp+Irp] 05: .text:00010340   mov     ecx, [eax+0Ch] 06: .text:00010343   mov     [ebp+var_8], ecx 07: .text:00010346   mov     edx, [ebp+Irp] 08: .text:00010349   mov     dword ptr [edx+1Ch], 644h 09: .text:00010350   mov     eax, [ebp+var_C] 10: .text:00010353   mov     [ebp+var_14], eax 11: .text:00010356   cmp     [ebp+var_14], 22C004h 12: .text:0001035D   jz      short loc_10361  In the previous paragraph, we deduced that var_10 is of type PIO_STACK_ LOCATION. Lines 1–2 access offset 0xC of the IO_STACK_LOCATION. Again, recall  that an IO_STACK_LOCATION contains the I O request parameters, which are all  stored in unions. How do you determine which union to use? We know that  it will use the DeviceIoControl fi eld because we are processing an IRP_MJ_ DEVICE_CONTROL request. Also, the IoControlField is at offset 0xC from the  base of IO_STACK_LOCATION:  1: kd> dt nt!_IO_STACK_LOCATION Parameters.    +0x004 Parameters  :       +0x000 Create      :         +0x000 CreatePipe  :         +0x000 CreateMailslot :         +0x000 Read        :         +0x000 Write       :         +0x000 QueryDirectory :   ...       +0x000 DeviceIoControl :   ... 1: kd> dt nt!_IO_STACK_LOCATION Parameters.DeviceIoControl.    +0x004 Parameters                  :       +0x000 DeviceIoControl             :          +0x000 OutputBufferLength          : Uint4B          +0x004 InputBufferLength           : Uint4B          +0x008 IoControlCode               : Uint4B          +0x00c Type3InputBuffer            : Ptr32 Void  Therefore, lines 1–3 retrieve the IoControlCode fi eld and save it in var_C,   which we now know is of type ULONG.  Lines 4–6 access offset 0xC in an IRP and save the pointer to a local variable  var_8. From the previous section, we know that at offset 0xC is the AssociatedIrp  union:  1: kd> dt nt!_IRP AssociatedIrp.    +0x00c AssociatedIrp  :  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 163   164   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel        +0x000 MasterIrp      : Ptr32 _IRP       +0x000 IrpCount       : Int4B       +0x000 SystemBuffer   : Ptr32 Void  Which of the three fi elds should you use? Given the current information, you  cannot tell. The context required to determine the proper fi eld is in lines 9–12,  which retrieve the saved IOCTL code  var_C  and compare it against 0x22c004.  You know that an IOCTL code encodes device type, function code, access, and  buffering method. Hence, after decoding 0x22c004, you know the following:     Device type is FILE_DEVICE_UNKNOWN  0x22 .    The IOCTL code is 0x1.    Access is  FILE_READ_DATA  FILE_WRITE_DATA .    Buffering method is METHOD_BUFFERED.   Recall that we are in an IOCTL handler and that drivers must specify a buffer- ing method when defi ning the IOCTL code. For buffered I O, the SystemBuffer  fi eld points to a non-paged pool buffer storing the user input. We can now say  that lines 4–6 access the SystemBuffer fi eld.  Lines 7–8 write 0x644 to offset 0x1c inside an IRP, which is the IRP->IoStatus.  Information fi eld. It is unclear why the author chose this value.   Given this information, you know that the control code must have been   constructed this way:  define IOCTL_1 CTL_CODE FILE_DEVICE_UNKNOWN, 1, METHOD_BUFFERED, \                                FILE_READ_DATA  FILE_WRITE_DATA   Because we have not fully analyzed or understood the IOCTL operation, we  gave it the generic IOCTL_1 name. This block can now be decompiled as follows:  PVOID userinput = Irp->AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer; Irp->IoStatus.Information =  ULONG_PTR  0x644; if  isl->Parameters.DeviceIoControl.IoControlCode == IOCTL_1  {   ...    loc_10361 } ...    0001035F  To understand what the IOCTL does, we need to analyze loc_10361 and the  function sub_103B0. However, before doing that, let’s fi nish the nearby blocks  fi rst  as they are simpler :     remember var_4 is status local variable  type NTSTATUS  01: .text:0001035F   jmp     short loc_1036C 02: .text:00010361 loc_10361:              03: .text:00010361   mov     ecx, [ebp+var_8]  ;  04: .text:00010364   push    ecx            c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 164      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   165  05: .text:00010365   call    IOCTL_1_handler 06: .text:0001036A   jmp     short loc_1037D 07: .text:0001036C loc_1036C:              08: .text:0001036C   mov     [ebp+var_4], 0C0000010h  09: .text:00010373   mov     edx, [ebp+Irp] 10: .text:00010376   mov     dword ptr [edx+1Ch], 0 11: .text:0001037D loc_1037D:               12: .text:0001037D   cmp     [ebp+var_4], 103h 13: .text:00010384   jz      short loc_1039A 14: .text:00010386   xor     dl, dl                   ; PriorityBoost 15: .text:00010388   mov     ecx, [ebp+Irp]           ; Irp 16: .text:0001038B   call    ds:IofCompleteRequest 17: .text:00010391   mov     eax, [ebp+Irp] 18: .text:00010394   mov     ecx, [ebp+var_4] 19: .text:00010397   mov     [eax+18h], ecx 20: .text:0001039A loc_1039A:                 21: .text:0001039A   mov     eax, [ebp+var_4] 22: .text:0001039D   mov     esp, ebp 23: .text:0001039F   pop     ebp 24: .text:000103A0   retn    8 25: .text:000103A0 IRP_ReadCloseDeviceIO endp  You enter 0x1035F if the IOCTL code does not match up. It immediately  jumps to line 7, which sets the local status variable to 0xC0000010, which is  STATUS_INVALID_OPERATION; and Irp->IoStatus.Information to 0. Next, in  line 11, it checks whether the local status is 0x103  STATUS_PENDING ; this block  is actually redundant because the status variable in this function can only have  two values  STATUS_SUCCESS or STATUS_INVALID_OPERATION . When an IRP is  marked with STATUS_PENDING, it means that the operation is incomplete and  is awaiting completion from another driver. This occurs often in drivers so it is  wise to remember the magic constant 0x103. If the status is STATUS_PENDING,  the handler immediately returns with that status  line 13 and 20 . Otherwise,  it calls IoCompleteRequest to mark the IRP completed and saves the status in  IRP->IoStatus.Status  line 19  and returns it. This is actually a bug because a  driver should set the IoStatusBlock fi eld before completing the request; once an  IRP is completed, it should not be touched again. These blocks can be decom- piled as follows:  status = STATUS_INVALID_OPERATION; Irp->IoStatus.Information = 0; if  status == STATUS_PENDING  {   return status; } IoCompleteRequest Irp, IO_NO_INCREMENT ; Irp->IoStatus.Status = status; return status;  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 165   166   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel  Returning to the IOCTL_1_handler routine, note that it calls only two other  functions: sub_10460 and sub_10550. sub_10550 is a small leaf routine so we  will analyze that fi rst:  01: .text:00010550 ; void __stdcall sub_10550 PMDL Mdl, PVOID BaseAddress  02: .text:00010550 sub_10550 proc near  03: .text:00010550   push    ebp 04: .text:00010551   mov     ebp, esp 05: .text:00010553   mov     eax, [ebp+Mdl] 06: .text:00010556   push    eax                    ; MemoryDescriptorList 07: .text:00010557   mov     ecx, [ebp+BaseAddress] 08: .text:0001055A   push    ecx                    ; BaseAddress 09: .text:0001055B   call    ds:MmUnmapLockedPages 10: .text:00010561   mov     edx, [ebp+Mdl] 11: .text:00010564   push    edx                    ; MemoryDescriptorList 12: .text:00010565   call    ds:MmUnlockPages 13: .text:0001056B   mov     eax, [ebp+Mdl] 14: .text:0001056E   push    eax                    ; Mdl 15: .text:0001056F   call    ds:IoFreeMdl 16: .text:00010575   pop     ebp 17: .text:00010576   retn    8 18: .text:00010576 sub_10550 endp  This function unmaps, unlocks, and frees an MDL.

IoAllocateMdl,  MmProbeAndLockPages, and MmMapLockedPagesSpecifyCache are routines used  to create, lock, and map MDLs; MmProbeAndLockPages must be done inside a  try except block so there is extra code generated in the beginning to set up the  exception handler  i.e., the lines involving fs:0 . This routine effectively maps a  buffer into kernel space as writable and returns the address of a new mapping  for this buffer. The whole routine can be roughly decompiled as follows:  PVOID MapMdl PMDL *mdl, PVOID VirtualAddress, ULONG Length  {   PVOID addr;    virtual address of the mapped MDL    *mdl = IoAllocateMdl VirtualAddress, Length, FALSE, FALSE, NULL ;   if  *mdl == NULL  return NULL;   __try {     MmProbeAndLockPages *mdl, KernelMode, IoWriteAccess ;     addr = MmMapLockedPagesSpecifyCache   c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 168      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   169                       *mdl,                      KernelMode,                      MmNonCached,                      NULL,                      FALSE,                      NormalPagePriority ;     if  addr == NULL  {       MmUnlockPages *mdl ;       IoFreeMdl *mdl ;     }   } __except  EXCEPTION_EXECUTE_HANDLER  {     IoFreeMdl *mdl ;   }   return addr; }  With an understanding of these two routines, we can now approach the  handler. Note that it takes one parameter, Irp->AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer.  Recall that the content of this buffer may be copied back to user mode once the  IRP is completed:  01: .text:000103B0 ; void __stdcall IOCTL_1_handler PVOID buffer  02: .text:000103B0 IOCTL_1_handler proc near 03: .text:000103B0   push    ebp 04: .text:000103B1   mov     ebp, esp 05: .text:000103B3   sub     esp, 10h 06: .text:000103B6   push    esi 07: .text:000103B7   call    ds:KeRaiseIrqlToDpcLevel 08: .text:000103BD   mov     [ebp+NewIrql], al 09: .text:000103C0   mov     eax, ds:KeServiceDescriptorTable 10: .text:000103C5   mov     ecx, [eax+8] 11: .text:000103C8   shl     ecx, 2 12: .text:000103CB   push    ecx                 ; Length 13: .text:000103CC   mov     edx, ds:KeServiceDescriptorTable 14: .text:000103D2   mov     eax, [edx] 15: .text:000103D4   push    eax                 ; VirtualAddress 16: .text:000103D5   lea     ecx, [ebp+Mdl] 17: .text:000103D8   push    ecx                 ; mdl 18: .text:000103D9   call    MapMdl 19: .text:000103DE   mov     [ebp+BaseAddress], eax 20: .text:000103E1   cmp     [ebp+BaseAddress], 0 21: .text:000103E5   jz      short loc_10449 22: .text:000103E7   mov     [ebp+var_8], 0 23: .text:000103EE   jmp     short loc_103F9 24: .text:000103F0 loc_103F0: 25: .text:000103F0   mov     edx, [ebp+var_8] 26: .text:000103F3   add     edx, 1 27: .text:000103F6   mov     [ebp+var_8], edx 28: .text:000103F9 loc_103F9: 29: .text:000103F9   mov     eax, [ebp+buffer]  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 169   170   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel  30: .text:000103FC   mov     ecx, [ebp+var_8] 31: .text:000103FF   cmp     ecx, [eax] 32: .text:00010401   jnb     short loc_1043C 33: .text:00010403   mov     edx, [ebp+var_8] 34: .text:00010406   mov     eax, [ebp+buffer] 35: .text:00010409   cmp     dword ptr [eax+edx*4+4], 0 36: .text:0001040E   jz      short loc_1043A 37: .text:00010410   mov     ecx, [ebp+var_8] 38: .text:00010413   mov     edx, [ebp+BaseAddress] 39: .text:00010416   mov     eax, [ebp+var_8] 40: .text:00010419   mov     esi, [ebp+buffer] 41: .text:0001041C   mov     ecx, [edx+ecx*4] 42: .text:0001041F   cmp     ecx, [esi+eax*4+4] 43: .text:00010423   jz      short loc_1043A 44: .text:00010425   mov     edx, [ebp+var_8] 45: .text:00010428   mov     eax, [ebp+buffer] 46: .text:0001042B   mov     ecx, [eax+edx*4+4] 47: .text:0001042F   mov     edx, [ebp+var_8] 48: .text:00010432   mov     eax, [ebp+BaseAddress] 49: .text:00010435   lea     edx, [eax+edx*4] 50: .text:00010438   xchg    ecx, [edx] 51: .text:0001043A loc_1043A: 52: .text:0001043A   jmp     short loc_103F0 53: .text:0001043C loc_1043C: 54: .text:0001043C   mov     eax, [ebp+BaseAddress] 55: .text:0001043F   push    eax                 ; BaseAddress 56: .text:00010440   mov     ecx, [ebp+Mdl] 57: .text:00010443   push    ecx                 ; Mdl 58: .text:00010444   call    UnmapMdl 59: .text:00010449 loc_10449: 60: .text:00010449   mov     cl, [ebp+NewIrql]   ; NewIrql 61: .text:0001044C   call    ds:KfLowerIrql 62: .text:00010452   pop     esi 63: .text:00010453   mov     esp, ebp 64: .text:00010455   pop     ebp 65: .text:00010456   retn    4 66: .text:00010456 IOCTL_1_handler endp  This function fi rst raises the IRQL to DISPATCH_LEVEL  line 7 , which effec- tively suspends the thread dispatcher on the current processor. Whatever this  function does, it cannot wait or take a pagefault; otherwise, the machine will  bugcheck. The same effect can be achieved with KeRaiseIrql. Line 8 saves the  previous IRQL so that it can be restored later  see line 61 . Lines 9–11 retrieve  the undocumented KeServiceDescriptorTable entry fi eld and multiply it by  4. Lines 12–18 pass KiServiceTable, a length  four times the size of the syscall  table , and an MDL pointer to MapMdl. Because we already analyzed MapMdl, we  know that this simply maps a buffer starting from KiServiceTable to KiService Table+ NumberOfSyscalls*4 . Line 12 saves the virtual address of the newly  mapped buffer. Lines 20–22 check the mapping status; if it was not successful,   c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 170      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   171  the IRQL is lowered and the code returns  lines 60–65 , otherwise, a loop is  entered whose counter is determined by the user input  lines 29–31 . The loop  body is from lines 33–50 and can be understood as follows:  DWORD *userbuffer = Irp->AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer; DWORD *mappedKiServiceTable = MapMdl mdl, KiServiceTable, nsyscalls*4 ; for  i=0; i < userbuffer[0] ; i++  {   if   userbuffer[i+1] != 0  {     if   userbuffer[i+1] != mappedKiServiceTable[i]  {       swap mappedKiServiceTable[i], userbuffer[i+1] ;     }   } } ... UnmapMdl mdl ; KeLowerIrql oldirql ;  After many pages of explanations and decompiling the entire driver, you can  now understand the sample’s goal. For whatever reason, the developer of this  driver wanted to use an IOCTL to overwrite the NT native system calls table  with custom addresses. The user-mode buffer is a structure in this format:  [ of system calls] [syscall 1 replacement address] [syscall 2 replacement address] ... [syscall n replacement address]  While the developer may have achieved his or her goals, the driver has several  critical issues that can lead to system instability and security vulnerabilities.  Some were mentioned during the walk-through, but you should be able to  identify many others. Here are some questions to start your quest:     Will this driver work on a multi-core system? Explain your reasoning.    Why does the author think the IRQL needs to be raised to DISPATCH_LEVEL?   Is it really necessary?  0 context?     How can a normal user use this driver to execute arbitrary code in ring      Suppose the author wanted to replace some system calls with a custom   implementation in user space. What problems might be encountered?  This driver is very small and simple, but it has most of the important con- structs typically found in software drivers: dispatch routines, device I O control  from user mode, buffering methods, symbolic links, raising and lowering IRQL  levels, MDL management, IO_STACK_LOCATIONs, and so on. You can apply the  same analytical techniques shown here to other drivers. Just don’t imitate its  development techniques in real life.  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 171   172   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel  An x64 Rootkit This section analyzes Sample B, an x64 driver. Because it is quite large and com- plex, we will focus only on areas related to callbacks. We will not paste every  line of this function, so you will need to follow it in a disassembler.  Note that this driver specifi es process creation and image load notifi cations  using the documented APIs. 0x4045F8 is the start of the process creation call- back routine. First, it clears a LARGE_INTEGER structure to zero. A LARGE_INTEGER  structure is typically used to represent fi le size or time  note that it is later  used at 0x4046FF as an argument to KeDelayExecutionThread . Next, it gets  the current process id with PsGetCurrentProcessId. Does this get the process  id of the newly created process? Not necessarily. The process creation callback  prototype is as follows:  VOID  *PCREATE_PROCESS_NOTIFY_ROUTINE        IN HANDLE  ParentId,     IN HANDLE  ProcessId,    processId of the created terminated proc     IN BOOLEAN  Create    TRUE=creation FALSE=termination      ;  The Creation parameter is saved and tested at 0x404604 and 0x404631, respec- tively; if it is TRUE, then the callback simply returns. Hence, we know that this  callback tracks only process termination. In the case of process termination,  the callback executes in the context of the dying process. After gathering the  terminating process id  which is not used at all , it retrieves the EPROCESS object  for the current process through IoGetCurrentProcess  0x40461C and 0x404622 .  It is not clear why IoGetCurrentProcess is called twice  it could be a typo in the  original source code . Next, it retrieves and saves the process image fi lename  string through PsGetProcessImageFileName  0x404633 . While this routine  is not documented, it is simple, exported, and frequently used by the kernel.  Then it tries to acquire a resource lock previously initialized in DriverEntry   0x4025EB ; it enters a critical region before acquiring a resource lock because  KeAcquireResourceExclusiveLite requires normal kernel APCs to be disabled   which is what KeEnterCriticalRegion does . Next, it gets a pointer to a linked  list and checks the terminating process image name against each entry in the  list  offset 0x20 . You know that this is a linked list because the loop iterates by  pointers  0x404679  and terminates when two pointers are the same  0x40465F .  If there is no match, it releases the resource lock and pauses the current thread   0x4046FF  one second from the current time. If the terminating process fi lename  matches one of those in the list, then it unmaps, unlocks, and frees an MDL  stored in the list entry  offset 0x1070 . If the buffer at offset 0x10b0 in the list  entry is NULL, then it is freed; otherwise, the entry is freed from the list by the  RemoveEntryList macro:  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 172      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   173  01: .text:00000000004046CA loc_4046CA: 02: .text:00000000004046CA   mov     rax, [rbx+8] 03: .text:00000000004046CE   mov     r8, [rbx] 04: .text:00000000004046D1   mov     edx, edi      ; Tag 05: .text:00000000004046D3   mov     [rax], r8 06: .text:00000000004046D6   mov     rcx, rbx      ; P 07: .text:00000000004046D9   mov     [r8+8], rax 08: .text:00000000004046DD   call    cs:ExFreePoolWithTag  Again, we can recognize the list operation because of the Flink  offset 0x0  and  Blink  offset 0x8  manipulation pattern. In fact, we can now say that qword_40A590  is of type LIST_ENTRY.  Even though this callback is only one piece of the puzzle, you can apply the  previous facts to indirectly understand other components of the rootkit. For  example, you can tell that the rootkit either maps or injects code into processes  and tracks them in a large linked list  using process name as the key . When the  process dies, they have to unmap those MDLs because the system will bugcheck  if a dead process still has locked pages. The original MDL mappings were most  likely done through the image load callback routine  0x406494 .  Another interesting routine in this fi le is 0x4038F0. We will do a line-by-line  analysis of this routine because it uses constructs that you will frequently see  in other drivers. Furthermore, it teaches some valuable lessons about analyzing  optimized x64 code:  01: ; NTSTATUS __cdecl sub_4038F0 PFILE_OBJECT FileObject, \                               HANDLE Handle, BOOLEAN flag  02: sub_4038F0 proc near 03:   push    rbx 04:   push    rbp 05:   push    rsi 06:   push    rdi 07:   push    r12 08:   sub     rsp, 60h 09:   mov     bpl, r8b 10:   mov     r12, rdx 11:   mov     rdi, rcx 12:   call    cs:IoGetRelatedDeviceObject 13:   mov     [rsp+88h+arg_18], 1 14:   xor     edx, edx       ; ChargeQuota 15:   mov     cl, [rax+4Ch]  ; StackSize 16:   mov     rsi, rax 17:   call    cs:IoAllocateIrp 18:   test    rax, rax 19:   mov     rbx, rax 20:   jnz     short loc_403932 21:   mov     eax, 0C0000017h 22:   jmp     loc_403A0C 23: loc_403932:         24:   lea     rax, [rsp+88h+arg_18] 25:   xor     r8d, r8d       ; State  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 173   174   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel  26:   lea     rcx, [rsp+88h+Event] ; Event 27:   mov     [rbx+18h], rax ; IRP.AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer 28:   lea     rax, [rsp+88h+Event] 29:   lea     edx, [r8+1]    ; Type 30:   mov     [rbx+50h], rax ; IRP.UserEvent 31:   lea     rax, [rsp+88h+var_58] 32:   mov     [rbx+48h], rax ; IRP.UserIosb 33:   mov     rax, gs:+188h  ; KPCR.Prcb.CurrentThread 34:   mov     [rbx+0C0h], rdi ; IRP.Tail.Overlay.OriginalFileObject 35:   mov     [rbx+98h], rax ; IRP.Tail.Overlay.Thread 36:   mov     byte ptr [rbx+40h], 0 ; IRP.RequestorMode 37:   call    cs:KeInitializeEvent 38:   test    bpl, bpl 39:   mov     rcx, [rbx+0B8h] 40:   mov     byte ptr [rcx-48h], 6 ; IRP_MJ_SET_INFORMATION 41:   mov     [rcx-20h], rsi ; IO_STACK_LOCATION.DeviceObject 42:   mov     [rcx-18h], rdi ; IO_STACK_LOCATION.FileObject 43:   jz      short loc_4039A6 44:   mov     rax, [rdi+28h] ; FILE_OBJECT.SectionObjectPointer 45:   test    rax, rax 46:   jz      short loc_4039A6 47:   mov     [rax+10h], 0 ; SECTION_OBJECT_POINTERS.ImageSectionObject 48: loc_4039A6: 49:   mov     [rcx-28h], r12                ; IO_STACK_LOCATION.Parameters.SetFile.DeleteHandle 50:   mov     [rcx-30h], rdi               ; IO_STACK_LOCATION.Parameters.SetFile.FileObject 51:   mov     dword ptr [rcx-38h], 0Dh ; FileDispositionInformation               ; IO_STACK_LOCATION.Parameters.SetFile.FileInformationClass 52:   mov     dword ptr [rcx-40h], 1               ; IO_STACK_LOCATION.Parameters.SetFile.Length 53:   mov     rax, [rbx+0B8h] ; CurrentIrpStackLocation 54:   lea     rcx, sub_4038B4 ; completionroutine 55:   mov     [rax-10h], rcx  ; IO_STACK_LOCATION.CompletionRoutine 56:   mov     rcx, rsi       ; DeviceObject 57:   mov     rdx, rbx       ; Irp 58:   mov     qword ptr [rax-8], 0  59:   mov     byte ptr [rax-45h], 0E0h ; flag 60:   call    cs:IofCallDriver 61:   cmp     eax, 103h ; STATUS_PENDING 62:   jnz     short loc_403A09 63:   lea     rcx, [rsp+88h+Event] ; Object 64:   mov     r9b, 1         ; Alertable 65:   xor     r8d, r8d       ; WaitMode 66:   xor     edx, edx       ; WaitReason 67:   mov     [rsp+88h+var_68], 0 68:   call    cs:KeWaitForSingleObject 69: loc_403A09:       70:   mov     eax, [rbx+30h] ; IRP.IoStatus.Status 71: loc_403A0C:       72:   add     rsp, 60h 73:   pop     r12 74:   pop     rdi  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 174      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   175  75:   pop     rsi 76:   pop     rbp 77:   pop     rbx 78:   retn 79: sub_4038F0 endp  First, we recover the function prototype by noting that the function’s caller  uses three registers: RCX, RDX, R8  see 0x404AC8 to 0x404ADB . Even though the  disassembler marks CDECL as the function’s calling convention, it is not really  correct. Recall that Windows on the x64 platform only uses one calling con- vention which specifi es that the fi rst four arguments are passed via regis- ters  RCX, RDX, R8, and R9  and the rest are pushed on the stack. Line 12 calls  IoGetRelatedDeviceObject using FileObject as the parameter; this API returns  the device object associated with the fi le object. The associated device object is  saved in RSI. Lines 14–17 allocate an IRP from scratch with IoAllocateIrp; the  device object’s StackSize fi eld is used as the new IRP’s IO_STACK_LOCATION size.  If the IRP allocation somehow fails, the routine returns STATUS_NO_MEMORY  lines  20–22 . Otherwise, the new IRP is saved in RBX  line 19  and we continue to  line 24. Lines 24–37 initialize basic fi elds of an IRP and call KeInitializeEvent.  Line 33 may look strange because of the GS:188h parameter. Recall that on x64  Windows, the kernel stores a pointer to the PCR in GS, which contains the PRCB  that stores scheduling information. In fact, this routine is simply the inlined  form of KeGetCurrentThread. Line 39 accesses a fi eld at offset 0xb8 in the IRP  structure. What is this fi eld?  0: kd> dt nt!_IRP Tail.Overlay.    +0x078 Tail          :       +0x000 Overlay       :          +0x000 DeviceQueueEntry : _KDEVICE_QUEUE_ENTRY          +0x000 DriverContext : [4] Ptr64 Void          +0x020 Thread        : Ptr64 _ETHREAD          +0x028 AuxiliaryBuffer : Ptr64 Char          +0x030 ListEntry     : _LIST_ENTRY          +0x040 CurrentStackLocation : Ptr64 _IO_STACK_LOCATION          +0x040 PacketType    : Uint4B          +0x048 OriginalFileObject : Ptr64 _FILE_OBJECT  It is accessing the CurrentStackLocation pointer in the Overlay union. Does  this sound familiar? Line 39 is actually just IoGetCurrentIrpStackLocation.  Lines 40–42 set some fi elds using negative offsets from the current stack loca- tion. Recall that the dynamic part of an IRP is an array of IO_STACK_LOCATION  structures and the “next” stack location is actually the element above the current  one. Review this structure and its size:  0: kd> sizeof _IO_STACK_LOCATION  unsigned int64 0x48 0: kd> dt _IO_STACK_LOCATION nt!_IO_STACK_LOCATION  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 175   176   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel     +0x000 MajorFunction    : UChar    +0x001 MinorFunction    : UChar    +0x002 Flags            : UChar    +0x003 Control          : UChar    +0x008 Parameters       :      +0x028 DeviceObject     : Ptr64 _DEVICE_OBJECT    +0x030 FileObject       : Ptr64 _FILE_OBJECT    +0x038 CompletionRoutine : Ptr64     long    +0x040 Context          : Ptr64 Void  The size of an IRP on x64 Windows is 0x48. Hence, line 40 must be access- ing the “next” IO_STACK_LOCATION because it is subtracting 0x48 bytes from  the current location; it is setting the MajorFunction fi eld to 0x6  IRP_MJ_ SET_INFORMATION . This tells you that the parameters for this request will be  described using the SetFile union member. Line 41 accesses the “next” IRP  with negative offsets 0x20 and 0x18, which corresponds to the DeviceObject  and FileObject fi elds, respectively. What is happening here is that the devel- oper used IoGetNextIrpStackLocation and then fi lled out the fi eld, and the  aggressive Microsoft x64 compiler optimized the code that way. The optimizer  decided that because we are operating on an array of structures, it is cheaper   in terms of space  to directly access the previous element using negative offsets;  the alternative would have been to calculate a new base pointer for the previ- ous element and access its fi elds using positive offsets. You will run into this  optimization quite often in x64 binaries.  Line 43 tests a fl ag to determine whether additional checks should be performed  for section objects. Lines 44–47 set the ImageSectionObject fi eld accordingly.  Lines 48–52 initialize various fi elds in the “next” IRP stack location using nega- tive offsets again. These offsets are inside the Parameters union; as we already  know the IRP major function  IRP_MJ_SET_INFORMATION , we know that it will  use the SetFile union member:  1: kd> dt nt!_IO_STACK_LOCATION Parameters.SetFile.    +0x008 Parameters          :       +0x000 SetFile             :          +0x000 Length              : Uint4B          +0x008 FileInformationClass : _FILE_INFORMATION_CLASS          +0x010 FileObject          : Ptr64 _FILE_OBJECT          +0x018 ReplaceIfExists     : UChar          +0x019 AdvanceOnly         : UChar          +0x018 ClusterCount        : Uint4B          +0x018 DeleteHandle        : Ptr64 Void  After calculating the offsets, we know that line 49 sets the DeleteHandle fi eld  with the second parameter, line 50 sets the FileObject fi eld, line 51 sets the  FileInformationClass fi eld  0xD is FileDispositionInformation , and line 52  sets the Length fi eld. The documentation for the FileDispositionInformation  class says that it will take a structure with a one-byte fi eld; if it is 1, then the fi le   c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 176      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   177  handle is marked for deletion. Hence, we now know why lines 13 and 27 set  the IRP.AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer to 1. Lines 53–55 set sub_4038B4 as this  IRP’s completion routine. Line 60 passes the newly fi lled IRP to another driver   taken from line 16  for processing  most likely the fi le system driver . Line 61  checks status with STATUS_PENDING to see if the operation is done; if yes, the  IRP’s status is returned in EAX; if not, KeWaitForSingleObject is called to wait  on the event initialized in line 37. The completion routine will set the event and  free the IRP when it’s done:  01: sub_4038B4 proc near 02:   push    rbx 03:   sub     rsp, 20h 04:   movdqu  xmm0, xmmword ptr [rdx+30h] 05:   mov     rax, [rdx+48h] 06:   mov     rbx, rdx 07:   xor     r8d, r8d       ; Wait 08:   xor     edx, edx       ; Increment 09:   movdqu  xmmword ptr [rax], xmm0 10:   mov     rcx, [rbx+50h] ; Event 11:   call    cs:KeSetEvent 12:   mov     rcx, rbx       ; Irp 13:   call    cs:IoFreeIrp 14:   mov     eax, 0C0000016h 15:   add     rsp, 20h 16:   pop     rbx 17:   retn 18: sub_4038B4 endp  The entire routine can be decompiled as follows:  NTSTATUS sub_4038F0 PFILE_OBJECT FileObj, HANDLE hdelete, BOOLEAN flag  {   NTSTATUS status;   PIO_STACK_LOCATION iosl;   PIRP Irp;   PDEVICE_OBJECT devobj;   KEVENT event;   IO_STATUS_BLOCK iosb;   CHAR buf = 1;    devobj = IoGetRelatedDeviceObject FileObj ;   Irp = IoAllocateIrp devobj->StackSize, FALSE ;   if  Irp == NULL  { return STATUS_NO_MEMORY; }   Irp->AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer = &buf;   Irp->UserEvent = &event;   Irp->UserIosb = &iosb;   Irp->Tail.Overlay.Thread = KeGetCurrentThread  ;   Irp->Tail.Overlay.OriginalFileObject = FileObj;   Irp->RequestorMode = KernelMode;   KeInitializeEvent &event, SynchronizationEvent, FALSE ;  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 177   178   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel    iosl = IoGetNextIrpStackLocation Irp ;   iosl->DeviceObject = devobj;   iosl->FileObject = FileObj;   if  !flag && FileObj->SectionObjectPointer != NULL  {     FileObj->SectionObjectPointer.ImageSectionObject = NULL;   }   iosl->Parameters.SetFile.FileObject = FileObj;   iosl->Parameters.SetFile.DeleteHandle = hdelete;   iosl->Parameters.SetFile.FileInformationClass = \                                      FileDispositionInformation;   iosl->Parameters.SetFile.Length = 1;   IoSkipCurrentIrpStackLocation Irp ;   IoSetCompletionRoutine Irp, sub_4038B4, NULL, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE ;   if  IoCallDriver devobj, Irp  == STATUS_PENDING  {     KeWaitForSingleObject &event, Executive, KernelMode, TRUE, NULL ;   }   return Irp->IoStatus.Status; }  Now you can see that the driver uses this function to delete a fi le from the  system without using the fi le deletion API  ZwDeleteFile . It achieves this by  crafting its own IRP to describe the fi le deletion operation and passes it down  to a lower driver  presumably the fi le system . Also, it uses a completion rou- tine to be notifi ed when the IRP is complete  either success, failed, or somehow  cancelled . While somewhat esoteric, this method is very useful because it can  bypass security software that tries to detect fi le deletion through system call  hooking.  This walk-through demonstrated two main points. First, if you know and  understand the objects and mechanisms drivers used to interact with the kernel,  your analytical task becomes easier. Second, you must be prepared to deal with  code that seems strange due to an aggressive optimizer. This is especially true  for x64 code. The only way to improve is to practice.  Next Steps  We have covered most of the important domain-specifi c concepts relevant to  kernel-mode code in Windows. This knowledge can be immediately applied to  driver reverse engineering tasks. To be more effective, however, it is instructive  to understand what normal drivers look like in source form. The best way to  learn that is to study driver samples included in the WDK and or develop your  own drivers. While they are not rootkits, they demonstrate the proper structure  and constructs used by drivers.  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 178      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   179  Where do you go from here? Our advice is as follows  in order :     Read the WDK manual thoroughly. You can start with the “Kernel-Mode  Driver Architecture” section. It is confusing at fi rst, but if you read this  chapter it will be much easier because we bypassed all the non-essential  topics.     Read Windows NT Device Driver Development by Peter G. Viscarola and W.  Anthony Mason from cover to cover  you can skip the chapter on DMA  and programmed I O .     Write a few small, simple drivers. Then analyze them in a disassembler  without looking at the source code. Be sure you do this for both x86 and x64.    Review the Recon 2011 presentation Decompiling kernel drivers and IDA   plugins, by Bruce Dang and Rolf Rolles.     Read the Microsoft debugger documentation for useful kernel extensions    e.g., !process, !thread, !pcr, !devobj, !drvobj, etc.      Read all articles published in The NT Insider and kernel-related articles in  Uninformed. The former is probably the most useful resource for Windows  kernel driver development in general. The latter is more geared toward  security enthusiasts.     Do all the exercises at the end of this chapter. All of them. Some may  take a substantial amount of time because you will need to read up on  undocumented areas not covered in the book. Reading and exploring are  steps in the learning process.     Open the Windows kernel binary in a disassembler and try to understand   how some of the common APIs work.     Read the http:  kernel-mode.info forums.    Analyze as many rootkits as you can. While analyzing, think about why  and how the rootkit author chose to use certain objects mechanisms and  assess whether they are appropriate.     Find and read open-source Windows drivers.    After you think you have a good understanding of the basic concepts,  you can explore other areas of the kernel such as the network and stor- age stacks. These are two highly complex areas so you will need a lot of  time and patience.     Subscribe to the NTDEV and NTFSD mailing lists to read about other   developers’ problems and how they solved them.  Keep reading, practicing, and learning! There is a steep learning curve, but  once you pass that, it is smooth sailing. Remember: Without failure, it is diffi cult  to appreciate success. Happy bugchecking.  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 179   180   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel  Exercises  We believe that the best way to learn is through a combination of concept dis- cussion, hands-on tutorials, and independent exercises. The fi rst two items have  been covered in the previous sections. The following independent exercises  have been designed to help you build confi dence, solidify your understand- ing of Windows kernel concepts, explore and extend knowledge into areas not  covered in the book, and continue to analyze real-world drivers. As with other  chapters, all exercises are taken from real-world scenarios. We reference fi les as   Sample A, B, C, etc. . The SHA1 hash for each sample is listed in the Appendix.  Building Conﬁ dence and Solidifying Your Knowledge Each of these exercises can usually be answered within 30 minutes. Some may  require additional reading thinking, so they might take longer.   1.  Explain why code running at DISPATCH_LEVEL cannot take a page fault.  There can be multiple explanations for this. You should be able to come  up with at least two.    2.  Suppose you read an article on the Internet about the Windows kernel  and it claims that kernel-mode threads always have higher priority than  user-mode threads; hence, if you write everything in kernel mode, it will  be faster. Assess the validity of this claim using your knowledge of IRQL,  thread dispatching, and thread priority.    3.  Write a driver for Windows 7 8 that prints out the base address of every  newly loaded image. Repeat the same for processes and threads. This  driver does not need to set up any IRP handler because it does not need  to process requests from users or other drivers.    4.  Explain the security implications of using METHOD_NEITHER and what driver   developers do to mitigate them.    5.  Given a kernel-mode virtual address, manually convert it to a physi- cal address. Verify your answer using the !vtop extension in the kernel  debugger.    6.  Develop a driver that uses all the list operations and identify all the inlined  list routines in assembly form. Is there a generic pattern for each routine?  If so, explain them. If not, explain why.    7.  You learned about linked lists, but the kernel also supports hash tables,  search trees, and bitmaps. Investigate their usage and develop a driver  using all of them.    8.  Explain how the FIELD_OFFSET macro works.  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 180      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   181    9.  The exported function ExGetCurrentProcessorCpuUsage is undocumented,  but a documented NDIS API NdisGetCurrentProcessorCpuUsage uses it  internally. Explain how ExGetCurrentProcessorCpuUsage works on x64  and x86 Windows.    10.  Explain how KeGetCurrentIrql works on x86 and x64.   11.  Explain how the following APIs work in Windows 7 8 on x86 x64 ARM:     IoThreadToProcess     PsGetThreadProcessId     PsIsSystemThread     PsGetCurrentThreadId     PsGetCurrentThreadPreviousMode     PsGetCurrentThreadProcess     PsGetCurrentThreadStackBase     PsGetCurrentThreadWin32Thread     PsGetThreadId     PsGetThreadSessionId     PsIsSystemProcess     PsGetProcessImageFileName    12.  The PCR, PRCB, EPROCESS, KPROCESS, ETHREAD, and KTHREAD structures store  a lot of useful information. Unfortunately, all of them are opaque struc- tures and can change from one version of Windows to the next. Hence,  many rootkits hardcode offsets into these structures. Investigate these  structures on Windows XP, 2003, Vista, and 7 and note the differences.  Can you devise ways to generically get the offsets of some useful fi elds  without hardcoding? If so, can you do it such that it will work on all the  listed platforms?  Hint: You can use a disassembler, pattern matching and  relative distance.     13.  The MmGetPhysicalAddress API takes a virtual address and returns the  physical address for it. Sometimes the returned physical address contains  junk data. Explain why this may happen and how to mitigate it.    14.  Set up test-signing on your 32- and 64-bit machines and test-sign your   driver. Validate that it works.    15.  Explain how AuxKlibGetImageExportDirectory works. After that, explain   how RtlImageNtHeader and RtlImageDirectoryEntryToData work.    16.  Suppose you want to track the life and death of processes. What data  structure would you use and what are some properties you can use to  uniquely identify a process?  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 181   182   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel    17.  Where is the page directory table  CR3 in x86 and TTBR in ARM  stored in   a process?  Investigating and Extending Your Knowledge These exercises require that you to do more background research. You may  need to develop drivers using undocumented APIs or access undocumented  structures. You should use the knowledge from the experiments only for good.   1.  Many modern operating systems support a feature called Data Execution  Prevent  DEP . Sometimes it is called Never Execute  NX  or Execute Never   XN . This feature simply blocks code execution in memory pages that  are not marked executable. Investigate how this feature is implemented  in hardware  x86, x64, and ARM  and how the operating system supports  it. After that, investigate how this feature would be implemented without  any hardware support.    2.  Although we covered the basic idea behind APCs, we did not explain how  to use them. Investigate the  undocumented  APIs related to kernel-mode  APCs and how they are used. Write a driver that uses them.    3.  Devise and implement at least two methods to execute a user-mode process  from a kernel-mode driver. Assess the advantages and disadvantages of  each method.    4.  Suppose that you are on an SMP system with four processors and you  want to modify a shared global resource. The global resource is in non- paged pool and it can be modifi ed at any time by any processor. Devise a  synchronization mechanism to safely modify this resource.  Hint: Think  about IRQL and the thread dispatcher.     5.  Write a driver that blocks all future drivers with the name “bda.sys” from   loading.    6.  Investigate how the Windows input stack works and implement a key- board logger. The keylogger can be implemented in several different ways   with and without hooking . Assess the advantages and disadvantages  of each keylogging method. Is it possible to get the application receiving  the keystrokes?    7.  Implement a function that takes a virtual address and change its page  protection to readable, writable, and executable. Repeat the same task for  a virtual address that is in session space  e.g., win32k.sys .    8.  We explained that DriverEntry is the fi rst function to be called in a driver.  Explain which function actually calls this routine. How did you fi gure it  out?  c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 182      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   183    9.  The Microsoft kernel debugger provides a mechanism that breaks into  the debugger when a driver is loaded. This is done through the "sxe  ld:drivername" command. Build a simple driver and experiment with  this command. Explain how it works. Enumerate all the different ways  that it may fail.    10.  User-mode debuggers can easily “freeze” threads in a process; however,  the kernel debugger does not have a facility to do so. Devise a way to  freeze and unfreeze a user-mode thread from the kernel.    11.  Periodic timers are used by drivers to execute something on a regular  basis. Develop a driver that will print a “hello” every 10 minutes. Then  devise a way to modify the timer expiration after it has been queued. You  can use a debugger to do this.    12.  Implement a driver that installs its own interrupt handler and validate  that it is triggerable from user mode. On x64 Windows, you will run into  PatchGuard so be sure to test it only in debug mode.    13.  Process privileges are defi ned using tokens. The highest privilege is  LocalSystem  the SYSTEM process runs in this context . Develop a driver  that changes a running process privilege such that it runs with LocalSystem  privilege.    14.  Windows Vista and higher support cryptographic operations in kernel  mode through the KSECDD driver. While it is not documented in the offi - cial WDK, it is on MSDN under the user-mode bcrypt library. Develop a  driver that uses AES, RSA, MD5, SHA1, and a random number generator.   15.  Develop a driver that enumerates the address and name of all exported  symbols in NTDLL, KERNEL32, and KERNELBASE. Repeat the same for  USER32 and GDI32. Did you run into any diffi culties? If so, how did you  fi x them?    16.  Develop a driver that hooks an exported function in NTDLL in the  "explorer.exe" process. Assess the merit of your method. Investigate  and evaluate other methods.    17.  Develop a driver that attaches to the SMSS.EXE process and patch a win32k  system call while in that process context. Explain the problems you encoun- tered and how you solved them.    18.  Suppose someone tells you that user-mode exceptions do not ever go into  the kernel. Research how user-mode exception handling works in x86 and  x64 Windows and assess the aforementioned claim.    19.  Suppose you have a malicious driver on the system that hooks INT 1 and  INT 3 to make debugging tracing more diffi cult. Devise a way to get an   c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 183   184   Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel  execution trace  or debug code  even with these hooks in place. You have  no restrictions. What are some of the corner cases that you must handle?   20.  The instruction INT 3 can be represented in two forms. The one-byte ver- sion, 0xCC, is the most common. The less common two-byte form is 0xCD03.  Explain what happens when you use the two-byte form in Windows.  Analysis of Real-Life Drivers These exercises are meant for you to practice your analytical skills on a real  driver. We provide the fi le hashes and ask you questions about them. Most  if  not all  questions can be answered through static analysis, but you are welcome  to run the sample if needed.   1.   Sample D  Analyze and explain what the function 0x10001277 does.  Where does the second argument come from and can it ever be invalid?  What do the functions at offset 0x100012B0 and 0x100012BC do?    2.   Sample E  This fi le is fairly large and complex; some of its structures are  massive  nearly 4,000 bytes in size . However, it does contain functions  performing interesting tasks that were covered in the chapter, so several  of the exercises are taken from it. For this exercise, recover the prototype  for the functions 0x40400D, 0x403ECC, 0x403FAD, 0x403F48, 0x404088,  0x4057B8, 0x404102, and 0x405C7C, and explain the differences and rela- tionships between them  if any ; explain how you arrived at the solution.  Next, explain the signifi cance of the 0x30-byte non-paged pool allocation in  functions 0x403F48, 0x403ECC, and 0x403FA; while you’re at it, recover its  type as well. Also, explain why in some of the previous routines there is a  pool freeing operation at the beginning. These routines use undocumented  functions, so you may need to search the Internet for the prototype.    3.   Sample E  In DriverEntry, identify all the system worker threads. At offset  0x402C12, a system thread is created to do something mundane using an  interesting technique. Analyze and explain the goal of function 0x405775  and all functions called by it. In particular, explain the mechanism used in  function 0x403D65. When you understand the mechanism, write a driver  to do the same trick  but applied to a different I O request . Complete the  exercise by decompiling all four routines. This exercise is very instructive  and you will benefi t greatly from it.    4.   Sample E  The function 0x402CEC takes the device object associated with  \Device\Disk\DR0 as one of its parameters and sends a request to it using  IoBuildDeviceIoControlRequest. This device object describes the fi rst  partition of your boot drive. Decode the IOCTL it uses and fi nd the mean- ingful name for it.  Hint: Search all the included fi les in the WDK, includ- ing user-mode fi les.  Identify the structure associated with this request.   c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 184      Chapter 3   The Windows Kernel   185  Next, beautify the IDA output such that each local variable has a type and  meaningful name. Finally, decompile the routine back to C and explain  what it does  perhaps even write another driver that uses this method .   5.   Sample E  Decompile the function 0x401031 and give it a meaningful  name. Unless you are familiar with how SCSI works, it is recommended  that you read the SCSI Commands Reference Manual.    6.   Sample F  Explain what the function 0x100051D2 does and why. What’s  so special about offset 0x38  in the device extension structure? Recover as  many types as possible and decompile this routine. Finally, identify all  the timers, DPCs, and work items used by the driver.   c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 185   c03.indd  11:7:49:AM  01 21 2014  Page 186   C H A P T E R   4  Debugging and Automation  Debuggers are programs that leverage support from the processor and operat- ing system to enable tracing of other programs so that one can discover bugs  or simply understand the logic of the debugged program. Debuggers are an  essential tool for reverse engineers because, unlike disassemblers, they allow  runtime inspection of the program’s state.  The purpose of this chapter is to familiarize you with the free debugging  tools from Microsoft. It is not intended to teach you debugging techniques or  how to troubleshoot memory leaks, deadlocks, and so forth. Instead, it focuses  on the most important commands and automation scripting facilities, and  how to write debugger extensions for the sole purpose of aiding you in reverse  engineering tasks.  The chapter covers the following topics:    The debugging tools and basic commands—This section covers the basics  of debugging, various commands, expression evaluations and operators,  process and thread-related commands, and memory manipulation.  187  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 187   188   Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation     Scripting—The scripting language of the debugger engine is not very  user friendly. This section explains the language in a structured and easy  to follow manner, with various examples and a set of scripts to illustrate  each topic. After reading this section, you will start leveraging the power  of scripting in the debugger.     Using the SDK—When scripts are not enough, you can always write  extensions in C or C++. This section outlines the basics of extension writ- ing in C C++.  The Debugging Tools and Basic Commands  The Debugging Tools for Windows package is a set of debugging utilities that  you can download for free from Microsoft’s website. The toolset ships with four  debuggers that are all based on the same debugger engine  DbgEng .  The DbgEng is a COM object that enables other programs to use advanced  debugging APIs rather than just the plain Windows Debugging APIs. In fact,  the Debugging Tools package comes with an SDK that illustrates how to write  extensions for the DbgEng or host it in your own programs.  The Debugging Tools for Windows package includes the following debuggers:     NTSD CDB—Microsoft NT Symbolic Debugger  NTSD  and Microsoft  Console Debugger  CDB  are both identical except that the former cre- ates a new console window when started, whereas the latter inherits the  console window that was used to launch it.     WinDbg—This a graphical interface for the DbgEng. It supports source-  level debugging and saving workspaces.     KD—Kernel Debugger  KD  is used to debug the kernel.  The debuggers have a rich set of command-line switches. One particularly  useful switch is –z, which is used to analyze crash dumps  *.dmp , cab fi les   *.cab  containing a crash dump fi le. Another use of the -z switch is to analyze  PE fi les  executables or DLLs  by having the DbgEng map them as though they  were in a crash dump.  The following example runs the cdb debugger with the -z switch in order to   map calc.exe in the debugger:  C:\>cdb -z c:\windows\syswow64\calc.exe   Microsoft  R  Windows Debugger Version 6.13.0009.1140 X86 Copyright  c  Microsoft Corporation.

Many debugger commands won’t be present, especially the process control  commands  because the program is mapped for analysis inspection, not  for dynamic tracing debugging .  Using the -z switch, you can write powerful scripts to analyze programs and   extract information.  N O T E  You can conﬁ gure WinDbg to act as the just-in-time  JIT  debugger  for the  purposes of postmortem debugging  by running Windbg.exe -I once as a privi- leged user.  The following sections explain various debugger commands, providing   examples along the way.  Setting the Symbol Path Before launching any of the debuggers  WinDbg, CDB, NTSD, or KD , let’s set  up the _NT_SYMBOL_PATH environment variable:  _NT_SYMBOL_PATH=SRV*c:\ cache*http:  msdl.microsoft.com download symbols  You can also set that up from inside the debugger using the .sympath command:  N O T E  Setting the symbol path is important so that you can inspect some basic OS  structures as you debug the programs in question. For instance, the !peb extension  command will not function without symbols loaded for NTDLL.  Debugger Windows  in WinDbg:  The following windows, including their hotkeys when applicable, are exposed      Command output window  Alt+1 —This window enables you to type  commands and see the output of operations. While it is possible to debug   c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 189   190   Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation  using other windows and menu items, the command window enables  you to make use of the full power of DbgEng’s built-in commands and  the available extensions.     Registers window  Alt+4 —Displays the confi gured registers. It is possible  to customize this view to control which registers are displayed or hidden.    Memory  Alt+5 —Memory dump window. This window enables you  to see the contents of memory, and to scroll, copy, and even edit the  memory contents.     Calls  Alt+6 —Displays the call stack information.    Disassembly  Alt+7 —Whereas the command window will display the  current instruction disassembly listing, the disassembly window displays  a page worth of disassembled code. In this window it is also possible to  carry out actions with hotkeys:    Add or delete breakpoints on the selected line  F9     Process control  stepping F11, resuming F5, etc.     Navigation  Page up Page down to explore disassembled code    N O T E  WinDbg supports workspaces to enable the window conﬁ guration to be  saved or restored.  Evaluating Expressions The debugger understands two syntaxes for expression evaluation: Microsoft  Macro Assembler  MASM  and C++.  To determine the default expression evaluator, use .expr without any arguments:  0:000> .expr Current expression evaluator: MASM - Microsoft Assembler expressions  To change the current expression evaluation syntax, use  0:000> .expr  s c++ Current expression evaluator: C++ - C++ source expressions  or  0:000> .expr  s masm Current expression evaluator: MASM - Microsoft Assembler expressions  Use the ? command to evaluate expressions  using the default syntax . The ?? command is used to evaluate a C++ expression  disregarding the   default selected syntax .  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 190      Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation   191  N O T E  The C++ syntax is preferable when type symbol information is present and  you need to access structure members or simply leverage the C++ operators.  Numbers, if not prefi xed with a base specifi er, are interpreted using the  default radix setting. Use the n command to display the current number base,  or n base_value to set the new default base.  When using MASM syntax, you can express a number in a base of your choice,   use the following prefi xes:     0n123 for decimal    0x123 for hex    0t123 for octal    0y10101 for binary  ? 0y101  -> works ?? 0y101 -> does not work.  Unlike evaluating with the MASM syntax, when using ?? to evaluate com-  mands, it is not possible to override the radix:  N O T E  When the default radix is 16 and you try to evaluate an expression such as  abc, it can be confused between a symbol named abc or the hexadecimal number  abc  2748 decimal . To resolve the symbol instead, prepend ! before the variable  name: ? !abc.  As in the C++ language, the C++ evaluator syntax only permits the 0x prefi x for  hex and the 0 prefi x for octal numbers. If no prefi x is specifi ed, base 10 is used. To mix and match various types of expression, use the @@c++ expression    or @@masm expression :  0:000> .expr Current expression evaluator: MASM - Microsoft Assembler expressions 0:000> ? @@c++ @$peb->ImageSubsystemMajorVersion  + @@masm 0y1  Evaluate expression: 7 = 00000007  The @@ prefi x is a shorthand prefi x that can be used to denote the alternative   expression evaluation syntax  not the currently set syntax :  0:000> .expr Current expression evaluator: MASM - Microsoft Assembler expressions 0:000> ? @@ @$peb->ImageSubsystemMajorVersion  + @@masm 0y1  Evaluate expression: 7 = 00000007  You do not have to specify @@c++ …  because when MASM is the default,   @@ …  will use the C++ syntax and vice versa.  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 191   192   Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation  Useful Operators  This section illustrates various useful operators that can be used in expressions.  For the sake of demonstration, we use the predefi ned pseudo-registers $ip and  $peb, which denote the current instruction pointer and the _PEB * of the current  process, respectively. Other pseudo-registers are mentioned later in the chapter. The notation used is “operator  expression syntax ”, where the expression  syntax will be either C++ or MASM. Note that in the following examples the  MASM expression evaluator is set by default.     Pointer->Field  C++ —As in the preceding example, you use the arrow  operator to access the fi eld value pointed at by $peb and the offset of the  ImageSubsystemMajorVersion fi eld.     sizeof type   C++ —This operator returns the size of the structure.

Process and Thread Control  These are some commands that allow you control the fl ow of the debugger:    t  F11 —Step into.    gu  Shift+F11 —Go up. Steps out of the current function and back to the   caller.  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 194      Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation   195     p  F10 —Step over.    g  F5 —Go. Resumes program execution.    Ctrl+Break—When the debuggee is running, use this hotkey to suspend it.  Note that the preceding commands work only with live targets. There are useful variations to the “resume,” “step into,” and “step over”   instructions, including the following:     [tp]a Address—Step into. Steps over until the specifi ed address is reached.    gc—This is used to resume execution when a conditional breakpoint   suspends execution.  an exception occurs.     g[hn]—This is used to resume execution as handled or unhandled when   Another set of tracing stepping commands are useful to discover basic blocks:    [pt]c—Step over into until a CALL instruction is encountered.    [pt]h—Step over into until a branching instruction is encountered  all   kinds of jump, return, or call instructions .     [pt]t—Step over into until a RET instruction is encountered.    [pt]ct—Step over into until a CALL or RET instruction is encountered. Most of the preceding commands  tracing and stepping over  are implicitly   operating within the context of the current thread.

N O T E  Not all debugger commands can be preﬁ xed with ~N cmd so that they yield  information about thread N. Instead, use the thread-speciﬁ c command ~eN cmd.  If you are debugging various user mode processes  i.e., when the debugger is  launched with the -o switch , it is possible to switch from one process to another  using the  command. The following example uses Internet Explorer because  it normally spawns various child processes  with different integrity levels and  for various purposes :  C:\ dbg64>windbg -o "c:\Program Files  x86 \Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe"  Let it run, open a few tabs, and then let the debugger resume with g and then   suspend it and type :  To switch from one process to another, type Ns, where N is the process number:  0:030>  .  0   id: 1818     child  name: iexplore.exe    1   id: 1384     child  name: iexplore.exe  0:030> 1s 1:083>    0   id: 1818     child  name: iexplore.exe .  1   id: 1384     child  name: iexplore.exe  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 196      Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation   197  Once you switch to a new process, future commands will apply to this pro- cess. Breakpoints you set for a process will not be present in the other process.  N O T E  Aliases and pseudo-registers will be common to all the processes being  debugged.  Monitoring Debugging Events and Exceptions  It is possible to capture certain debugging events and exceptions as they occur  and let the debugger suspend, display, handle, leave unhandled, or just ignore  the event altogether.  The DbgEng may suspend the target and give the user a chance to decide   what action to take in the follow two circumstances:     Exceptions—These events happen when an exception triggers in the  context of the application  Access Violation, Divide By Zero, Single Step  Exception, etc. .     Events—These events are not errors, they are triggered by the operat- ing system to notify the debugger about certain activities taking place  a  new thread has been created or terminated, a module has been loaded or  unloaded, a new process has been created or terminated, etc. .  To list all the events, use the sx command. Equally, if you are using WinDbg,  you can navigate to the Debug Event Filters menu to graphically confi gure the  events, as shown in Figure 4-1.  Figure 4-1  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 197   198   Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation  The screenshot shows two sets of confi guration to control events:     Execution—Dictates what to do when that event takes place.    Continue—Decides how to resume from the event or exception.     Handled—Marks the exception as being handled  the application’s  exception handler will not trigger . This is useful when the debugger  breaks and you manually fi x the situation and then resume the appli- cation with the gh command.     Not Handled—Lets the application’s exception handler take care of   the exception. Use the gn command to resume.   Use the following commands to control how events exceptions are handled:    sxe event—Enables breaking for an event    sxd event—Disables breaking for an event    sxr event—Enables output only for an event    sxi event—Ignores the event  do not event output anything   The event parameter can be an exception code number, event short code   name, or * for any event.  A rather useful application of the sxe or the sxd commands is to catch module  loading or unloading. For example, when kernel debugging, to stop the debug- ger when a certain driver is loaded, use the following command:  sxe ld:driver_name.sys  To associate a command with an event, use the sx- -c command event com- mand. For example, to display the call stack each time a module is loaded, use  the following command:  sx- -c "k" ld  Registers, Memory, and Symbols This section covers some of the useful commands that deal with registers man- agement, memory contents inspection and modifi cation, symbols, structures,  and other handy commands.  Registers  The r command is used to display register values or to change them.  N O T E  The r command can also be used to alter ﬁ xed-name aliases and pseudo- registers values. This usage is covered in subsequent sections.  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 198      Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation   199  The general syntax of the r command is as follows:  r[M MaskFX] [RegisterName_Or_FlagName[:[Num]Type] [=[Expression_Or_Value]]]  Here is the simplest syntax of the r command:  r RegisterNameFlagName [= Expression_Or_Value ]  If the expression or value is omitted, then r will display the current value of   the register:  0:001> r eax eax=7ffda000 0:001> r eax = 2 0:001> r eax eax=00000002  To display the registers involved in the current instruction, use the r. command:  0:000> u rip L1 00007ff6`f54d6470 48895c2420      mov     qword ptr [rsp+20h],rbx 0:000> r. rsp=000000c9`e256fbb8  rbx=00000000`00000000   0:000> u eip L1 user32!MessageBoxA+0x3: 773922c5 8bec            mov     ebp,esp 0:000> r. ebp=0018ff98  esp=0018ff78  Register Masks The r command can be suffi xed with the M character followed by a 32-bit mask  value. The mask designates which registers to display when r is typed without  parameters. Table 4-1 shows a short list of the mask values:  Table 4-1: Register Mask Values  REGISTER MASK VALUE  DESCRIPTION  2  4  8  0x10  0x20  0x40  0x80  0x100  General registers  Floating-point registers  Segment registers  MMX  Debug registers  SSE XMM  Kernel mode: Control registers  Kernel mode: TSS  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 199   200   Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation  N O T E  Use the OR operator    to combine various masks.

This is very use- ful in many cases, as illustrated in the following examples.  Displaying Registers in Floating-Point Formats Suppose you’re debugging and notice that register eax holds a fl oating-point value:  To display it properly, use the following:  0:000> r eax eax=3f8ccccd  0:000> r eax:f eax=1.1  0:000> r rax rax=4014666666666666 0:000> r rax:d rax=5.1  To display the contents of rax in double-precision, fl oating-point value, use this:  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 201   202   Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation  Displaying Registers in Bytes Word Dword Qword Formats When registers are involved in data transfer, it is useful to see the register’s  individual bytes:  msvcrt!memcpy+0x220: 00007ff9`5f671a5d f30f7f40f0      movdqu  xmmword ptr [rax-10h],xmm0  0:000> r xmm0 xmm0=           0 1.05612e-038 1.01939e-038 1.00102e-038 0:000> r xmm0:ub xmm0=00 00 00 00 00 73 00 6c 00 6f 00 62 00 6d 00 79 0:000> rX xmm0:uw xmm0=0000 0000 0073 006c 006f 0062 006d 0079 0:000> rX xmm0:ud xmm0=00000000 0073006c 006f0062 006d0079 0:000> rX xmm0:uq xmm0=000000000073006c 006f0062006d0079  In the preceding example, memcpy   uses the XMM registers to transfer 16  bytes at a time. You use the ub format to display the contents of xmm0 in unsigned  bytes format, uw for word format, ud for double-word format, and uq for quad- word format. To display in signed format, use the i prefi x instead of u.   Display Selector Command The display selector command has the following syntax:  dg FirstSelector [LastSelector]  It displays information about a given selector  or range of selectors . In this  case, you are interested in selector values that are currently set in one of the  x86 x64 registers—namely, the cs, ds, ss, gs, and fs registers.  Selectors are used in the segment part of an address in protected mode. The following example executes the dg command for cs, ds, ss, gs, and fs,   respectively:  0:001> .foreach  s  sel "cs ds ss gs fs"  { dg sel; }  cs Selector                                    P Si Gr Pr Lo Sel    Base     Limit     Type    l ze an es ng Flags ---- -------- -------- ---------- - -- -- -- -- -------- 0023 00000000 ffffffff Code RE Ac 3 Bg Pg P  Nl 00000cfb  ds Selector                                    P Si Gr Pr Lo Sel    Base     Limit     Type    l ze an es ng Flags ---- -------- -------- ---------- - -- -- -- -- -------- 002B 00000000 ffffffff Data RW Ac 3 Bg Pg P  Nl 00000cf3  ss Selector   c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 202      Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation   203                                    P Si Gr Pr Lo Sel    Base     Limit     Type    l ze an es ng Flags ---- -------- -------- ---------- - -- -- -- -- -------- 002B 00000000 ffffffff Data RW Ac 3 Bg Pg P  Nl 00000cf3  gs Selector                                    P Si Gr Pr Lo Sel    Base     Limit     Type    l ze an es ng Flags ---- -------- -------- ---------- - -- -- -- -- -------- 002B 00000000 ffffffff Data RW Ac 3 Bg Pg P  Nl 00000cf3  fs Selector                                    P Si Gr Pr Lo Sel    Base     Limit     Type    l ze an es ng Flags ---- -------- -------- ---------- - -- -- -- -- -------- 0053 7ffda000 00000fff Data RW Ac 3 Bg By P  Nl 000004f3  In MS Windows user-mode applications, the cs, ds, es, ss, and gs selectors have  a base value of zero, thus the linear address is the same as the virtual address. Conversely, the fs register is variable, changing its value from thread to  thread. The fs segment in user-mode processes points to the TEB  Thread  Environment Block  structure:  0:003> dg fs Sel    Base     Limit     Type    l ze an es ng Flags ---- -------- -------- ---------- - -- -- -- -- -------- 0053 ff306000 00000fff Data RW Ac 3 Bg By P  Nl 000004f3   Switch to another thread  0:003> ~2s 0:002> dg fs Sel    Base     Limit     Type    l ze an es ng Flags ---- -------- -------- ---------- - -- -- -- -- -------- 0053 ff4a5000 00000fff Data RW Ac 3 Bg By P  Nl 000004f3  Memory  Before describing memory-related commands, it is important to explain the  address and range notations because they are passed as arguments to most  commands that require a memory address and count.  The Address parameter can be any value, expression, or symbol that resolves  to a numeric value that can be interpreted as an address. The number 0x401000  can be treated as an address if the address is mapped in memory. The name  kernel32 will resolve to the image base of the module:  0:000> lmm kernel32 start    end        module name 75830000 75970000   KERNEL32 0:000> ? kernel32 Evaluate expression: 1971519488 = 75830000  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 203   204   Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation  A symbol such as module_name!SymbolName can be used as an address as   long as it resolves:  0:000> ? kernel32!GetProcAddress Couldn't resolve error at 'kernel32!GetProcAddress' 0:000> ? kernelbase!GetProcAddress Evaluate expression: 1979722334 = 76002a5e  It is possible to use any expression as an address  notwithstanding whether   the value resolves to a valid address or not :  0:000> ?  kernelbase!GetProcAddress - kernel32    0n4096 Evaluate expression: 2002 = 000007d2  The Range parameter can be specifi ed in two ways. The fi rst method is with   a pair of starting and ending addresses:  0:000> db 02c0000 02c0005 002c0000  23 01 00 00 00 00                                .....  The second method is by using an address followed by the L character and   an expression  address L Expression_Or_Value  that designs a count.  If the count is a positive value, then the starting address will be the specifi ed   address, and the ending address is implied and equal to address + count:  0:000> db 02c0000 L5 002c0000  23 01 00 00 00                                   ....  If the count is a negative value, then the ending address becomes the specifi ed   address, and the starting address becomes address - count:  0:000> db 02c0005 L-5 002c0000  23 01 00 00 00                                   ....  By default, the expression or the value passed after L cannot exceed 256MB.  This is to prevent accidentally passing very large values. To overwrite this  limitation, use L? instead of just L. For example, notice how the DbgEng will  complain about this big size:  0:000> db @$ip L0xffffffff                          ^ Range error in 'db @$ip l0xffffffff  When L? is used, the DbgEng will be happy to comply:  0:000> db @$ip L?0xffffffff 760039c2  83 e4 f8 83 ec 18 8b 4d-1c 8b c1 25 b7 7f 00 00  .......M...%.... …  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 204      Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation   205  Dumping Memory Contents The d command is used to dump memory contents. The general syntax is as  follows:  d[abcdDfpquwW] [Options] [Range]  Various formats can be used to display memory contents. The most common   formats are as follows:     b, w, d, q—For byte, word, double-word, and quad-word format, respectively    f, D—For single and double-precision fl oating-point values, respectively    a, u—To display ASCII or Unicode memory contents, respectively    p—For pointer values  the size varies according to the current pointer   size of the target   When the dp, dd, or dq are suffi xed with s, the symbols corresponding to the  addresses will be displayed. This can be handy to discover function pointers  that are defi ned in an array or a virtual table:   1  0:011> bp combase!CoCreateInstance  2  0:024> g Breakpoint 0 hit combase!CoCreateInstance: 7526aeb0 8bff            mov     edi,edi 0:011> ? poi esp+4*5  Evaluate expression: 112323728 = 06b1ec90 0:011> ? poi poi esp+4*5   Evaluate expression: 0 = 00000000  3  0:011> g poi esp  combase!CustomUnmarshalInterface+0x15d: 752743e7 fe8ef0000000    dec     byte ptr [esi+0F0h]         ds:002b:08664160=01 0:011> ? poi 06b1ec90  Evaluate expression: 141774136 = 08734d38  4  0:011> dps 08734d38 L1 08734d38  752c9688 combase!CErrorObject::`vftable' 0:011> dps 752c9688 L3 752c9688  752f6bdf combase![thunk]:CErrorObject::QueryInterface`adjustor{8}' 752c968c  752f6bd0 combase![thunk]:CErrorObject::AddRef`adjustor{8}' 752c9690  752a9b91 combase![thunk]:CErrorObject::Release`adjustor{8}'  Marker 1 adds a breakpoint on the following function:  HRESULT CoCreateInstance    REFCLSID rclsid,   c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 205   206   Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation    LPUNKNOWN pUnkOuter,   DWORD dwClsContext,    REFIID riid,   LPVOID *ppv   We are interested in determining the pointer value  parameter 5  of the newly  created interface after the function returns. On marker 2, we resume execu- tion. The program later breaks on the breakpoint and gets suspended. We then  inspect the fi fth pointer location and dereference it. Its dereferenced value should  be NULL and initialized properly only if the function returns successfully. On  marker 3, we let the debugger run the CoCreateInstance function and return  to the caller. We then dereference the output pointer again. Finally, on marker  4, we use the dps command to display the address of the vftable, and then use  dps once more to display three pointers at the vftable.  N O T E  dps is equivalent to dds on 32-bits targets, and to dqs on 64-bits targets.  Editing Memory Contents To edit the memory contents, use the e command. The general syntax is as follows:  e[bdDfpqw] Address [Values]   N O T E  If no suﬃ  x is speciﬁ ed after the e command, the last suﬃ  x that was previ- ously used with e will be used. For instance, if ed were used the ﬁ rst time, then the  next time e alone is used, it will act as if it were ed.  Use the b, w, d, or q format specifi ers to set byte, word, dword, or qword values,   respectively, at the specifi ed memory address:  0:000> eb 0x1b0000 11 22 33 44; db 0x1b0000 L 4 001b0000  11 22 33 44 0:000> ed 0x1b0000 0xdeadbeef 0xdeadc0de; dd 0x1b0000 L 2 001b0000  deadbeef deadc0de  It is possible to use single quotes to enter character values when using either  of the w d or q formats. The DbgEng will respect the “endianness” of the target:  0:000> ed 1b0000 'TAG1' 0:000> db 1b0000 'TAG1' L 4 001b0000  31 47 41 54                                      1GAT  Apart from editing the memory with integer values, the e command has other   format specifi ers that allow you to enter other types:  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 206      Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation   207     e[fD]  address values —Sets a single or double-precision fl oating-pointer   number: 0:000> eD @$t0 1999.99 0:000> dD @$t0 L 1 000000c9`e2450000                 1999.99     ep  address values —Sets pointer-sized values. This command knows   how big a pointer is based on the currently debugged target.     e[au]  address string —Enters an ASCII or Unicode string at the given   address. The entered string will not be zero terminated:  0:000> f 0x1b0000 L0x40 0x21 0x22 0x23; db 0x1b0000 L0x20; Filled 0x40 bytes 001b0000  21 22 23 21 22 23 21 22-23 21 22 23 21 22 23 21   !"!"!"!"!"! 001b0010  22 23 21 22 23 21 22 23-21 22 23 21 22 23 21 22   "!"!"!"!"!" 0:000> ea 0x1b0000 "Hello world"; db 0x1b0000 L0x20 001b0000  48 65 6c 6c 6f 20 77 6f-72 6c 64 23 21 22 23 21  Hello  world!"! 001b0010  22 23 21 22 23 21 22 23-21 22 23 21 22 23 21 22   "!"!"!"!"!"     e[zazu]  address string —As opposed to e[au], this command will   enter the zero character termination at the end of the string.  To fi ll a memory area with a given pattern, use the f command:  f Address L Count Values For example:  0:000> f @eax L0x40 0x21 0x22 0x23; db @eax L0x20 Filled 0x40 bytes 001b0000  21 22 23 21 22 23 21 22-23 21 22 23 21 22 23 21  !"!"!"!"!"! 001b0010  22 23 21 22 23 21 22 23-21 22 23 21 22 23 21 22  "!"!"!"!"!"  Miscellaneous Memory Commands Following is another set of memory-related commands that come in handy:     s [-[flags]type] Range Pattern—Searches the memory for a given   pattern  the debugger:     c Range_For_Address1 Address2—Compares two memory regions    .dvalloc [Options] Size—Allocates memory in the process space of   0:000> .dvalloc 0x2000 Allocated 2000 bytes starting at 001c0000     .dvfree [Options] BaseAddress Size—Frees the memory previously   allocated by .dvalloc  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 207   208   Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation     .readmem FileName Range—Reads a fi le from disk to the debuggee’s   memory:  kd> .readmem file.bin @eax L3 Reading 3 bytes.     .writemem FileName Range—Writes the debuggee’s memory to a fi le on disk  Symbols  The following commands enable you to inspect symbols and structured data:     dt [type] [address]—A very handy command to display the type of   an item at the given address:  $$ Display the type of the structure UNICODE_STRING 0:000> dt UNICODE_STRING ole32!UNICODE_STRING    +0x000 Length           : Uint2B    +0x002 MaximumLength    : Uint2B    +0x004 Buffer           : Ptr32 Wchar  $$ Display type information and values in a type at a given address 0:000> dt _UNICODE_STRING 0x18fef4 ntdll!_UNICODE_STRING  "KERNEL32.DLL"    +0x000 Length           : 0x18    +0x002 MaximumLength    : 0x1a    +0x004 Buffer           : 0x00590168  "KERNEL32.DLL"     dv [flags] [pattern]—Displays information about local variables    x [options] [module_pattern]![symbol_pattern]—Displays symbol s    in a given module or modules     !dh [options] Address—Dumps PE image headers    !drvobj DriverObjectPtr [Flags]—Displays information about a   DRIVER_OBJECT object.     !heap—Displays heap information    !pool—Displays kernel pool information  Breakpoints On the x86 x64 architecture, the DbgEng supports two types of breakpoints:     Software breakpoints—These breakpoints are created by saving the  byte at the breakpoint address then replacing it with a 0xCC byte  on   c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 208      Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation   209  x64 x64 . The debugger implements the underlying logic to handle the  breakpoint magic.     Hardware breakpoints—Also known as processor or data breakpoints,  these breakpoints may or may not be present depending on the hardware  running the target. They are limited in count and can be set up to trigger  on read, write, or execute.  The simple syntax to create a software breakpoint is as follows:  bp Address ["CommandString"]  bu Address "CommandString" bm SymbolPattern ["CommandString"]  N O T E  Please refer to the debugger documentation for the full syntax of the b*  commands.  To list breakpoints, simply use the bl command:  0:001> bl  0 e 771175c9     0001  0001   0:**** ntdll!RtlInitString+0x9  1 e 77117668     0001  0001   0:**** ntdll!RtlInitUnicodeString+0x38  2 e 771176be     0001  0001   0:**** ntdll!_sin_default+0x26  3 e 7711777e     0001  0001   0:**** ntdll!sqrt+0x2a  4 e 771177c0     0001  0001   0:**** ntdll!sqrt+0x6a  To disable breakpoints, use the bd command. Similarly, use the be command   to enable breakpoints, and the bc command to clear  delete  breakpoints.  You can specify a series of breakpoint IDs to enable, disable, or clear them:  be 0 2 4 Or a range:  be 1-3  be *  Or simply all breakpoints:  Unresolved Breakpoints  The bu command creates a breakpoint whose address is still unknown unre- solved or whose address may change if it belongs to a module  that is ASLR  aware  that is loaded and unloaded many times at different base addresses.  The debugger will try to reevaluate the breakpoint address when a new  module is loaded and if the symbol is matched the breakpoint becomes active.  When the module is unloaded, the breakpoint becomes inactive until the symbol  can be resolved again.  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 209   210   Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation  In short, the address of the breakpoint is not fi xed and will automatically be   adjusted by the debugger.  Software Breakpoints  Software breakpoints can be created using the bp command. If the address can  be resolved when the breakpoint is created, then the breakpoint becomes active.  If the breakpoint cannot be resolved, the breakpoint will act like an unresolved  breakpoint and become active once the address can be resolved. If the module  at the breakpoint address is unloaded and then loaded again, the previously  resolved breakpoint address will remain fi xed  as opposed to the unresolved  breakpoints .  Hardware Breakpoints  Hardware breakpoints can be created using the ba command. These breakpoints  are assisted by the hardware. To create a hardware breakpoint you need to  specify the address, access type, and size. The access type designates whether  to break on read  read write , write  write only , or execute. The size designates  how big the item you are breaking on access for is. For instance, to break on  “word access,” specify the size 2.  N O T E  can have.   There is an architectural limit on the number of hardware breakpoints you   Conditional Breakpoints  Conditional breakpoints can be any type of breakpoint just described. In fact,  each breakpoint can be associated with a command. When a conditional com- mand is associated with a breakpoint, the breakpoint can be considered a con- ditional breakpoint.  The following example creates a conditional breakpoint such that when eax  has the value of 5, the breakpoint will suspend execution; otherwise, the break- point will continue resuming execution:  0:000> uf kernelbase!GetLastError KERNELBASE!GetLastError: 7661d0d6 64a118000000    mov     eax,dword ptr fs:[00000018h] 7661d0dc 8b4034          mov     eax,dword ptr [eax+34h] 7661d0df c3              ret  0:000> bp 7661d0df ".if @eax!=5 { gc; }" 0:000> bl 0 e 7661d0df 0001  0001  0:*** KERNELBASE!GetLastError+0x9 ".if @eax!=5  {gc;}"  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 210      Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation   211  It is possible to associate a more elaborate condition with a breakpoint. This is  covered in the section “Scripting with the Debugging Tools,” later in this chapter.  Inspecting Processes and Modules The DbgEng enables you to inspect running processes, loaded unloaded mod- ules, or loaded kernel mode drivers.  To get the list of loaded and unloaded modules, use lm:  Similarly, in kernel mode debugging, the lm command will display the list   of loaded device drivers:  0:001> lm n start    end        module name 00400000 00405000   image00400000 5ca40000 5cb44000   MFC42 733a0000 733b9000   dwmapi 73890000 73928000   apphelp ...  kd> lm n start    end        module name 804d7000 806cd280   nt       ntkrnlpa.exe 806ce000 806ee380   hal      halaacpi.dll b205e000 b2081000   Fastfat  Fastfat.SYS  b2121000 b2161380   HTTP     HTTP.sys     b2d2b000 b2d4cd00   afd      afd.sys      b2d4d000 b2d74c00   netbt    netbt.sys    b2d75000 b2dcca80   tcpip    tcpip.sys    bf800000 bf9c0380   win32k   win32k.sys   f83e6000 f8472480   Ntfs     Ntfs.sys     f86ca000 f86d6c80   VolSnap  VolSnap.sys  f8aaa000 f8aad000   BOOTVID  BOOTVID.dll  ...  N O T E  The n option was passed to minimize the default output of the lm command.  To view module information  version, size, base, etc. , use the v switch for   verbose mode and m to specify a module name to match:  kd> lm v m *volsnap* start    end        module name f86ca000 f86d6c80   VolSnap     Loaded symbol image file: VolSnap.sys     Image path: VolSnap.sys     Image name: VolSnap.sys     Timestamp:        Tue Aug 03 23:00:14 2004  41107B6E   c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 211   212   Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation      CheckSum:         00017B61     ImageSize:        0000CC80     Translations:     0000.04b0 0000.04e4 0409.04b0 0409.04e4  When in kernel mode, you have a full view of all running processes. Use the   !process extension command with the 0 0 fl ags to list all running processes:  kd> !process 0 0 **** NT ACTIVE PROCESS DUMP **** PROCESS 823c8830  SessionId: none  Cid: 0004    Peb: 00000000  ParentCid:  0000     DirBase: 00334000  ObjectTable: e1000c90  HandleCount: 246.

Image: explorer.exe  N O T E  This is equivalent to using the !for_each_process extension command  without any parameters.  It is possible to set breakpoints in user-mode processes using the kernel  debugger. First you need to switch to the correct process context, and for that  you need the EPROCESS value:  kd> !process 0 0 explorer.exe PROCESS 81e68558  SessionId: 0  Cid: 0678    Peb: 7ffdd000  ParentCid: 0658     DirBase: 07f401e0  ObjectTable: e177aa70  HandleCount: 336.     Image: explorer.exe  Then use the .process  r  p EPROCESS command to switch to the context   of the desired process:  kd> .process  r  p 81e68558 Implicit process is now 81e68558 .cache forcedecodeuser done Loading User Symbols.........  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 212      Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation   213  At this point, after the context switch, use lm to not only list the loaded kernel   drivers but also the user-mode modules.  The next example sets a breakpoint at kernel32!CreateFileW for that EPROCESS:   1  kd> bp  p 81e68558 kernel32!CreateFileW  2  kd> bl  0 e 7c810976     0001  0001  kernel32!CreateFileW      Match process data 81e68558  3  kd> g Breakpoint 0 hit kernel32!CreateFileW: 001b:7c810976 8bff            mov     edi,edi  4  kd> .printf "%mu\n", poi @esp+4 ; C:\Temp\desktop.ini   In marker 1, we set an EPROCESS fi lter with the bp  p EPROCESS command so  that only the explore.exe process triggers the breakpoint. Marker 2 lists the  breakpoints. Note that it will only match for a certain EPROCESS. At marker 3  we resume execution and wait until the breakpoint triggers. At marker 4, we  display the fi lename that was accessed. Marker 4 will become much clearer after  you read the “Language” section later in this chapter.   Now suppose you want to display all processes that called the CreateFileW   API and display which fi lename was referenced:  kd> bp kernel32!CreateFileW "!process @$proc 0;.printf "%mu\n",poi @esp+4 ;gc;"  This will break whenever any user-mode process hits the breakpoint, and  then the breakpoint command will invoke !process with the current EPROCESS   set in the pre-defi ned pseudo-register $proc  to display the current process  context information, display the fi lename, and fi nally resume execution with gc.  N O T E  !process @$proc 0 is equivalent to !process -1 0.  When execution is resumed, you see this redacted output:  kd> g  PROCESS 82067020  SessionId: 0  Cid: 0138    Peb: 7ffdf000  ParentCid: 02a4     DirBase: 07f40260  ObjectTable: e1b66ef8  HandleCount: 251.

The .printf Command  The .printf command is one of the most useful commands to help display  information from scripts or commands. As in the C language, this command  takes format specifi ers. Following are a few important ones:     %p  pointer value —Displays a pointer value.    %d, %x, %u  number value —Displays integer values. The syntax is very   similar to C’s format specifi ers.     %ma   %mu   pointer value —Displays the ASCII Unicode string at the   specifi ed pointer.  value at the specifi ed pointer.  at the specifi ed pointer.     %msa   %msu  pointer value —Displays the ANSI_STRING   UNICODE_STRING      %y  pointer value —Displays the symbol name  and displacement if any    c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 214      Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation   215  Here is a simple example:  0:000> .printf "t0=%d t1=%d eax=%x ebx=%d\n", @$t0, @$t1, @eax, @ebx t0=0 t1=0 eax=5 ebx=8323228  There is no %s specifi er to expand string arguments. The following example  expands the value of the user-defi ned alias by embedding it in the format  parameter:  0:000> aS STR "TheValue" 0:000> al   Alias            Value    -------          -------  STR              TheValue   0:000> .printf "This value of string is ${STR}\n"  The .printf command can make use of the Debugger Markup Language    DML . To use DML with .printf, specify the  D switch.   N O T E  DML works only in WinDbg.  To display with strings with colors, use the col markup:  0:000> .printf  D " Hello  world\n" Hello world  It is also possible to use the u, i, and b tags for underline, italic, and bold,   respectively:  0:000> .printf  D " underline   bold   italics \n"; underline bold italics  A very useful markup is the link  because it makes the output clickable and   associated with a command:  0:000> .printf  D "Click  here \n" Click here  Some debugger commands also take the  D switch. For example, lm  D will  list the modules, and each module is clickable. When a module is clicked, the  command lmvm modulename will be issued.  N O T E  Use the .prefer_dml 1 command to toggle a global setting that tells com- mands that support DML to prefer DML when applicable.  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 215   216   Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation  For more information, check dml.doc in the debugging tools distribution.  Other Commands   Before ending our discussion about debugger commands, we list a few more  useful commands:     —Searches for a disassembly pattern.    !gle—Returns the last error code.    .logopen .logfile .logappend .logclose—Commands to manage log-  ging of output from the command window to text fi les.     .load—Loads a debugger extension.    .cls—Clears the debugger’s output window.  This command does not  work in scripts because it is not part of the DbgEng scripting language.     .effmach—Changes or displays the processor mode that the debugger  uses. It is useful when debugging WOW64 processes. This command is  also similar to the extension command !wow64exts.sw.  Scripting with the Debugging Tools  This section illustrates important scripting features in the DbgEng that are use- ful for automating reverse engineering and debugging tasks.  Pseudo-Registers The DbgEng supports pseudo-registers to hold certain values. All of the pseudo- registers start with the $ sign. Prefi xing a pseudo-register or a register with the  @ sign tells the interpreter that the identifi er is not a symbol, thus no exhaustive,  sometimes slow, symbol lookup will take place.  Predeﬁ ned Pseudo-Registers  In this section we introduce some useful predefi ned pseudo-registers. They  can be used in expressions or as parameters to debugger commands or scripts.  Please note that some pseudo-registers may or may not be defi ned, depending  on the debugged target.     $csp—The current call stack pointer. This is useful because you don’t   have to guess if you should use esp or rsp.     $ip—The current instruction pointer. Similarly, a dot  .  can be used to   denote the current instruction pointer.  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 216      Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation   217     $retreg $retreg64—The return registers  typically eax, edx:eax, or rax .    $p—The fi rst value that the last d? command displayed:  0:000> dd @$ip L 1 012aa5e5  012ec188 0:000> ? @$p Evaluate expression: 19841416 = 012ec188 0:000> dw @$ip+2 L 1 012aa5e5  c188 0:000> ? @$p Evaluate expression: 49544 = 0000c188 0:000> db @$ip+2 L 1 012aa5e5  88 0:000> ? @$p Evaluate expression: 136 = 00000088     $ra—The current return address. This is equivalent to poi @$csp .    $exentry—The entry point address of the fi rst executable of the current  process. This is very useful when debugging a program from the begin- ning because DbgEng does not break on the entry point but in the kernel.     $peb—Process Environment Block. This pseudo-register has the following      $proc—The EPROCESS* address of the current process in kernel mode. In   type: ntdll!_PEB *.  user-mode it equates to $peb.  ing type: ntdll!_TEB*.     $teb—Thread Environment Block of the current thread. It has the follow-     $thread—ETHREAD* in kernel mode. In user-mode it is same as $teb.    $tpid—The current process id.    $tid—The current thread id.    $ptrsize—The pointer size from the point of view of the debuggee. If  your host OS is 64-bit and you are debugging a 32-bit process, then $ptr- size=4. In kernel mode it returns the pointer size of the target machine.     $pagesize—The number of bytes per memory page  usually 4,096 .    $dbgtime—The current time  based on the computer running the debugger .    $bpNUM—The address associated with the breakpoint number:  0:000> bl  0 e 012aa597     0001  0001   0:**** calc!WinMainCRTStartup+0xf  1 e 012aa5ab     0001  0001   0:**** calc!WinMainCRTStartup+0x23 0:000> ? @$bp0 Evaluate expression: 19572119 = 012aa597 0:000> ? @$bp1 Evaluate expression: 19572139 = 012aa5ab  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 217   218   Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation     $exp—The value of the last expression evaluated:  0:000> r $t0 = 1 + 4 0:000> ? @$exp Evaluate expression: 5 = 00000005  or  0:000> ? Esp Evaluate expression: 1637096 = 0018fae8 0:000> ? @$exp Evaluate expression: 1637096 = 0018fae8  The fi rst example assigns a value into a pseudo-register after it was evaluated.  You can see how $exp returns the last value. The same is true for the second  example, which evaluates the value of the esp register.  User-Deﬁ ned Pseudo-Registers  In addition to the pre-defi ned pseudo-registers, DbgEng enables users to defi ne  their own set of pseudo-registers. DbgEng provides 20 user-defi ned pseudo- registers  UDPRs  for use and to store integer values. They are $t0 to $t19.  The r command is used to assign values to those registers:  0:000> r $t0 = 1234 0:000> ? @$t0 Evaluate expression: 4660 = 00001234  Because numbers can be pointers, it is possible to store typed pointers into   those pseudo-registers using the r? command:   1  0:000> ? poi @$ip  Evaluate expression: 409491562 = 1868586a  2  0:000> r? $t0 = @@c++  unsigned long * @$ip   3  0:000> ? @@c++ *@$t0   Evaluate expression: 409491562 = 1868586a  On marker 1, we dereference and evaluate the value pointed to by $ip. On  marker 2, we use r? to assign a C++ expression to $t0; the cast operator is used  to return a typed pointer  of type unsigned long *  into $t0. Finally, on marker  3 we use the C++ dereferencing operator to dereference $t0.  This would have  not been possible without having a previously typed $t0 or without preceding  the expression by a cast.   Here’s another example:  0:000> r? $t0 = @@c++ @$peb->ProcessParameters->ImagePathName  0:000> ? $t0  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 218      Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation   219  Evaluate expression: 0 = 00000000 0:000> ?? @$t0 struct _UNICODE_STRING  "c:\windows\syswow64\calc.exe"    +0x000 Length           : 0x38    +0x002 MaximumLength    : 0x3a    +0x004 Buffer           : 0x0098189e  "c:\windows\syswow64\calc.exe"  Note that when you evaluate $t0 with ?, you get zero. When you use the C++   evaluation syntax ??, however, you get the actual typed value.  Symbols, all kinds of pseudo-registers, or aliases can also be used in expressions.  Aliases An alias is a mechanism that enables you to create equivalence between a  value and a symbolic name. By evaluating the alias you get the value that was  assigned to the alias.  The DbgEng supports three kinds of aliases:     User-named aliases—As the name implies, these aliases are chosen by      Fixed-name aliases—There are ten of them, named $u0 .. $u9.    Automatic aliases—These are pre-defi ned aliases that expand to certain   the user.  values.  User-Named Aliases  This section describes how to create and manage user-defi ned aliases and  explains how they are interpreted.  Creating and Managing User-Named Aliases The following commands are used to create user-named aliases:      as AliasName Alias_Equivalence—Creates a line equivalence for the   given alias: as MyAlias lm;vertarget This will create an alias for two commands: lm and then vertarget. You  can execute both commands by invoking MyAlias.     aS AliasName Alias_Equivalence—Creates a phrase equivalence for the  given alias. That means a semicolon will terminate the alias equivalence   unless the equivalence was enclosed in quotes  and start a new command.  aS MyAlias lm;vertarget aS MyAlias "lm;vertarget"  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 219   220   Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation  The fi rst line will execute two things: create an alias with value lm and then  execute the vertarget command. The second line  because the equivalence  is enclosed in quotes  defi nes the alias with value lm;vertarget.  N O T E  User-deﬁ ned alias names cannot contain the space character.  Other alias commands include the following:    al—Lists already defi ned aliases.    ad [ q] AliasName*—Deletes an alias by name or all aliases. The  q   switch will not show error messages if the alias name was not found.  The aS command can used to create aliases that equate to environment vari- ables values, expressions, fi le contents, command output, or even string contents  from the debuggee’s memory:     aS  f AliasName FileName—Assigns the contents of a fi le to the alias:     aS  x AliasName Expression64—Assigns the 64-bit value of an expres- sion to the alias. This is useful in many ways, especially when assigning  the value of an automatic alias to a user-named alias:  0:000> aS  f AliasName c:\temp\lines.txt 0:000> al   Alias            Value    -------          -------   AliasName        line1 line2 line3 line4 line5  0:000> r $t0 = 0x123 0:000> as  x AliasName @$t0 0:000> al   Alias            Value    -------          -------   AliasName        0x123  0:000> as IncorrectAlias @$t0 0:000> al   Alias            Value    -------          -------   AliasName        0x123   IncorrectAlias   @$t0  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 220      Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation   221  Note that the fi rst as  x usage correctly assigned the value 0x123 to the  alias, whereas the second as assignment took the literal value of @$t0   because of the missing  x switch .     as  e AliasName EnvVarName—Sets the AliasName alias to the value of   the environment variable called EnvVarName:  0:000> as  e CmdPath COMSPEC 0:000> al   Alias            Value    -------          -------   CmdPath          C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe      as  ma AliasName Address—Sets the content of the null-terminated   ASCII string pointed to by the address in the alias:  0:000> db 0x40600C 0040600c  54 6f 6f 6c 62 61 72 57-69 6e 64 6f 77 33 32 00  ToolbarWin- dow32. 0:000> as  ma Str1 0x40600C 0:000> al   Alias            Value    -------          -------   Str1             ToolbarWindow32      as  mu AliasName Address—Sets the content of the null-terminated   Unicode string pointed to by the address in the alias     as  ms[au] AliasName Address—Sets the contents of an ASCII_STRING    structure defi ned in the DDK  or UNICODE_STRING in the alias:   1  0:000> dt _UNICODE_STRING ntdll!_UNICODuE_STRING    +0x000 Length           : Uint2B    +0x002 MaximumLength    : Uint2B    +0x004 Buffer           : Ptr32 Uint2B    2  0:000> ?? sizeof _UNICODE_STRING  unsigned int 8    3  0:000> ?? @@c++ @$peb->ProcessParameters->DllPath  struct _UNICODE_STRING  "C:\Windows\system32\NV"    +0x000 Length           : 0x2c    +0x002 MaximumLength    : 0x2e    +0x004 Buffer           : 0x001f1880  "C:\Windows\system32\NV"  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 221   222   Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation     4  0:000> dd @@c++ & @$peb->ProcessParameters->DllPath   L2 001f1408  002e002c 001f1880    5  0:000> db 001f1880 L2e 001f1880  43 00 3a 00 5c 00 57 00-69 00 6e 00 64 00 6f 00   C.:.\.W.i.n.d.o. 001f1890  77 00 73 00 5c 00 73 00-79 00 73 00 74 00 65 00   w.s.\.s.y.s.t.e. 001f18a0  6d 00 33 00 32 00 5c 00-4e 00 56 00 00 00        m.3.2.\.N.V...    6  0:000> as  msu DllPath @@c++ & @$peb->ProcessParameters->DllPath   0:000> al   Alias            Value    -------          -------   DllPath          C:\Windows\system32\NV   At marker 1, we display the fi elds of the _UNICODE_STRING structure, and  at marker 2 we display the structure’s size using the C++ evaluator. Similarly,  marker 3 uses the C++ typed evaluation to dump the value of DllPath fi eld.  Marker 4 uses the & operator to dump the _UNICODE_STRING fi eld contents, and  marker 5 dumps the Buffer address. Finally, marker 6 uses the as command to  create an alias with its contents read from a _UNICODE_STRING pointer.  Interpreting User-Named Aliases User-named aliases can be interpreted using the basic syntax ${AliasName} or  by simply typing the alias name. The former should be used when the alias is  embedded in a string and not surrounded by space characters:  0:000> aS AliasName "Alias value" 0:000> .printf "The value is >${AliasName}<\n" The value is >Alias value<  When an alias is not defi ned, alias evaluation syntax remains unevaluated:  0:000> .printf "The value is >${UnkAliasName}<\n" The value is >${UnkAliasName}<  The following switches control how the aliases are interpreted:     ${ d:AliasName}—Evaluates to 1 if the alias is defi ned, and 0 if the alias  is not defi ned. This switch comes in handy when used in a script to deter- mine whether an alias is defi ned or not:  0:000> .printf ">${ d:AliasName}<\n" >1<  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 222      Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation   223  0:000> .printf ">${ d:UnkAliasName}<\n" >0<     ${ f:AliasName}—When this switch is used, an undefi ned alias will  evaluate to an empty string or to the actual value if the alias was defi ned:  0:000> .printf ">${ f:DefinedAliasName}<\n" >Alias value< 0:000> .printf ">${ f:UndefinedAliasName}<\n" ><     ${ n:AliasName}—Evaluates to the alias name or remains unevaluated      ${ v:AliasName}—This switch prevents any alias evaluation:  After an alias is defi ned, it can be used in any subsequent command  as a   command or a parameter to a command :  if the alias is not defi ned:  0:000> .printf ">${ n:AliasName}<\n" >AliasName< 0:000> .printf ">${ n:AliasName2}<\n" >${ n:AliasName2}< 0:000> .printf ">${ n:UnkAliasName}<\n" >${ n:UnkAliasName}<   0:000> .printf ">${ v:AliasName}<\n" >${ v:AliasName}< 0:000> .printf ">${ v:UnkAliasName}<\n" >${ v:UnkAliasName}<  0:000> aS my_printf .printf 0:000> al   Alias            Value    -------          -------   my_printf        .printf  When used as a command:  0:000> ${my_printf} "Hello world\n" Hello world 0:000> my_printf "Hello world\n" Hello world  When used as a parameter to a command:  0:000> .printf "The command to display strings is >${my_printf}<\n" The command to display strings is >.printf  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 223   224   Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation  0:000> .printf "The command to display strings is my_printf \n" The command to display strings is  printf  When reassigning values to user-defi ned aliases, note the following:    Using the aS command as follows produces an error:  0:000> aS MyVar 0n123;.printf "v=%d", ${MyVar} v=Couldn't resolve error at '${MyVar}'  The reason for this error is because aliases are expanded in new blocks  only. This can be remedied with the following:  0:000> aS MyVar 0n123;.block { .printf "v=%d", ${MyVar}; } v=123     The  v: switch behaves like the  n: switch when used with aS, as, and   ad. The reason we mention this is illustrated in the following example:  0:000> aS MyVar 0n123;.block { aS  x MyVar ${MyVar}+1 } 0:000> al   Alias            Value    -------          -------   0n123            0x7c  MyVar            0n123  The fi rst command creates the MyVar alias and increments its value by  one; however, a new alias named 0n123 is created. That’s because the  MyVar alias has been replaced by its equivalent instead of being used as  an alias name. What you instead need to do is let the aS command know that MyVar is  the alias name, and its value should not be expanded or evaluated. This is  where the  v: switch, when used with the as or the aS command, should  be used:  0:000> aS MyVar 123;.block { aS  x ${ v:MyVar} ${MyVar}+1 };al   Alias            Value    -------          -------   MyVar            0x124  Notice that now, when ${ v:MyVar} is used in conjunction with aS, it  evaluates to the alias name  like the ${ n:AliasName} would .  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 224      Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation   225  Fixed-Name Aliases  As mentioned earlier, there are 10 fi xed-name aliases named $u0 through $u9.  While the fi xed-name aliases look like registers or pseudo-registers, they are  not. To assign values to them, use the r command followed by $. and the alias  name, like this:   1  0:000> r $.u0 = .printf  2  0:000> r $.u1 = 0x123  3  0:000> r $.u2 = Hello world  4  0:000> $u0 "$u2\n" Hello world  5  0:000> $u0 "$u2, u1=%x", $u1 Hello world, u1=123  Marker 1 aliases $u0 to the .printf command.  Note the $. prefi x and that  the .printf command is purposely not enclosed with quotes in the equivalence.  Marker 2 defi nes $u1 with a numeric value, and marker 3 defi nes $u2 with a  string value. Marker 4 uses $u0 as an equivalent to the .printf command and  prints $u2, which is enclosed in quotes and resolves to “Hello world.” Finally,  marker 5 prints the value $u1 in a similar fashion to marker 4.  N O T E  Always use $. when deﬁ ning the alias; however, when using the alias you do  not need to use $. or even the @ sign as you do for pseudo-registers or aliases.  Fixed-name alias replacement has a higher precedence than user-named aliases.  Automatic Aliases  The DbgEng defi nes a few aliases when the debugging session starts. The auto- matic aliases are similar to the pre-defi ned pseudo-registers except that they  can also be used with the ${} syntax  like user-named aliases .  The following registers are defi ned:      $ntnsym     $ntwsym     $ntsym     $CurrentDumpFile  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 225   226   Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation     $CurrentDumpPath    $CurrentDumpArchiveFile      $CurrentDumpArchivePath  To illustrate this, the following invokes the cdb command-line debugger with  the -z switch to open a crash dump fi le, and uses -cf script.wds to execute a  series of commands from a text fi le:  c:\Tools\dbg>cdb -cf av.wds -z m:\xp_kmem.dmp  The contents of the script fi le is as follows:  .printf "Script started\n" .logopen @"${$CurrentDumpFile}.log" !analyze -v .logclose .printf "Script finished, quitting\n" q  When the debugger starts, it will interpret each line in av.wds:    1.  Print a startup message.   2.  Open a log fi le that has the name of the current crash dump fi le with .log  appended to it. Note how you expand to automatic alias with the ${}  syntax.    3.  Issue the !analyze -v command.   4.  Close the log fi le, print a quit message, and exit the debugger with the q   command.  N O T E  The @ sign is used to deﬁ ne a literal  or raw  string. See the upcoming  “Characters and Strings” section.  Language In this section, we discuss the scripting language, tokens, and commands.  Comments  Use the $$ command to specify comments. For instance:  $$ This is a comment $$ This is another comment  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 226      Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation   227  To use more than one comment on a line with multiple statements, use the   semicolon character to terminate the comment:  r eax = 0; $$ clear EAX ; r ebx = ebx + 1; $$ increment EBX;  The asterisk  *  can also be used to create comments; however, the entire line   after the asterisk will be ignored even if a semicolon delimiter is used:  r eax = 0; * clear EAX ; r ebx = ebx + 1;  The preceding command will just clear EAX; it won’t increment EBX by one. There is a slight difference between the $$ comment specifi er and the .echo   command. The .echo command displays the line instead of just ignoring it.  Characters and Strings  Characters are specifi ed when enclosed in single quotes:  0:000> @dvalloc 1 0:000> eb @$t0 'a' 'b' 'c' 'd' 'f' 'g' 0:000> db @$t0 L 6 02250000  61 62 63 64 66 67  Strings are specifi ed with double quotes:  0:000> ea @$t0 "Practical reverse engineering"; 0:000> db @$t0 L20  02250000  50 72 61 63 74 69 63 61-6c 20 72 65 76 65 72 73  Practical revers 02250010  65 20 65 6e 67 69 6e 65-65 72 69 6e 67 00 00 00  e engineering...    As in C, the string may contain escape sequences; therefore, you need to   escape the sequence in order to get the correct result:   1  0:000> .printf "c:\\tools\\dbg\\windbg.exe\n" c:\tools\dbg\windbg.exe  2  0:000> .printf "a\tb\tc\n1\t2\t3\n" a      b      c 1      2      3   The fi rst command escaped the backslash with the escape character. The   second example uses the horizontal tab escape sequence  \t .  The DbgEng allows the use of raw strings; such strings will be interpreted  literally without taking into consideration the escape sequence. To specify a  literal string, precede the string with the at sign  @ :  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 227   228   Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation   1  0:000> .printf @"c:\tools\dbg\windbg.exe\n";.printf "\n"; c:\tools\dbg\windbg.exe\n  2  0:000> .printf @"a\tb\tc\n1\t2\t3\n" a\tb\tc\n1\t2\t3\n  Notice how the escape sequences remained as specifi ed without being inter- preted. Similarly, if you have a user-named alias that was created from memory  contents and you want to evaluate it literally, also prefi x the ${} with @:   1  0:000> aS  mu STR 0x3cba030 0:000> al   Alias            Value    -------          -------  STR              C:\Temp\file.txt  2  0:000> .printf "${STR}\n"; C:Tempfile.txt  3  0:000> .printf @"${STR}";.printf "\n"; C:\Temp\file.txt  Marker 1 creates a user-named alias from the zero-terminated Unicode string  at the specifi ed memory address and displays the list of aliases. Marker 2 prints  the alias value.  Notice that the output is not as intended.  At marker 3, after  prefi xing the string with @, the output is correct.  Blocks  A block can be created via the .block command followed by opening and clos- ing curly braces  { } :  When a user-named alias is created in a script, its value won’t be evaluated   interpreted as intended unless a new block is created:   .block {        $$ Inside a block ...        .block        {              $$ Nested block ...        } }  aS MyAlias  @eax + @edx  .block {        $$ Inside a block ...  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 228      Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation   229         .printf "The value of my alias is %X\n", ${MyAlias} }  Conditional Statements  The .if, .elsif, and .else command tokens are used to write conditional  statements.  The usage of .if and .elsif is similar to other languages where they take a  condition. The condition can be any expression that evaluates to zero  treated  as false  or a non-zero value  treated as true :  r $t0 = 3; .if  @$t0==1  {        .printf "one\n"; } .elsif @$t0==2 {        .printf "two\n"; } .elsif  @$t0==3  {        .printf "three\n"; } .else {        .printf "unknown\n"; }  N O T E  The use of parentheses around the condition is optional.  All the built-in repetition structures and conditional statements require the  use of the curly braces  { and }  and thus create a block, which results in the  proper evaluation of aliases:  aS MyAlias  @eax + @edx  .if  1  {        $$ Inside a block ...        .printf "The value of my alias is %X\n", ${MyAlias} }  You can also compare strings with .if using a few different methods:  $$ By enclosing the strings to be compared in single quotes: .if '${my_alias}'=='value' {         .printf "equal\n";  }  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 229   230   Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation  .else  {         .printf "not equal!\n"; }  $$ By using the MASM operator scmp  or sicmp : .if $scmp "${my_alias}", "value"  {        .printf "equal\n";  }  $$ By using the MASM operator spat: .if $spat "${my_alias}", "value"  {        .printf "equal\n";  } .else  {         .printf "not equal!\n"; }  The DbgEng also provides the j command, which can be compared to C’s  ternary operator   cond ? true-expr: false-expr , except that it runs com- mands instead of returning expressions:  j Expression [']Command-True['] ; [']Command-False[']  The following is a very simple example with one command being executed   in both cases  true or false :  0:000> r $t0 = -1 0:000> j  @$t0 < 0  r $t0 = @$t0-1 ; r $t0 = @$t0+1 0:000> ? $t0 Evaluate expression: -2 = fffffffe  The single quotes are optional in most cases; specify them if more than one   command is to be executed:  0:000> r $t0 = 2 0:000> j  @$t0 < 0  'r $t0 = @$t0-1;.echo Negative value' ;                      'r $t0 = @$t0+1;.echo Positive value' Positive value 0:000> ? $t0 Evaluate expression: 3 = 00000003  It is common to use the j command as part of breakpoint commands to form   conditional breakpoints.  The following example suspends the debugger  note the empty single quotes  that specify that no command should be executed when the expression evaluates  to True  only when the return address matches a certain value:  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 230      Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation   231  0:000> bp user32!MessageBoxA "j  @$ra=0x401058  '';'gc;'" 0:000> g user32!MessageBoxA: 756e22c2 8bff            mov     edi,edi 0:000> ? $ra Evaluate expression: 4198488 = 00401058  The next example suspends the debugger whenever the GetLastError func-  tion is called and it returns ACCESS_DENIED  value 5 :  0:014> bp kernelbase!GetLastError "g @$ra;j @eax==5 '';'gc'" 0:014> g uxtheme!ThemePreWndProc+0xd8: 00007ff8`484915e8 33c9            xor     ecx,ecx 0:000> !gle LastErrorValue:  Win32  0x5  5  - Access is denied. LastStatusValue:  NTSTATUS  0xc0000034 - Object Name not found.  This is not the optimal way to achieve that. The public symbols of NTDLL, when  loaded, expose a symbol called g_dwLastErrorToBreakOn. Editing this value in  memory and passing the desired error value to break on is the better approach:  0:000> ep ntdll!g_dwLastErrorToBreakOn 5 0:000> g  2a0.2228 : Break instruction exception - code 80000003  first chance  ntdll!RtlSetLastWin32Error+0x21: 00007ff8'4c444df1 cc              int     3 0:000> !gle LastErrorValue:  Win32  0  0  - The operation completed successfully. LastStatusValue:  NTSTATUS  0xc0000034 - Object Name not found.  Script Errors  If an error is encountered when a debugger script is executing, then the entire  script will be aborted after the error message is displayed. Consider a script fi le  with the following contents:  .printf "Script started\n"; invalid command; .printf "Script ending\n";  Script started Script started  When this script is executed, it will produce an error:     ^ Syntax error in '.printf "Script started ' 0:000>  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 231   232   Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation  To prevent the script from aborting, you can use the .catch command token:  .printf "Script started\n"; .catch {        invalid command;        .printf "!! will not be reached !!\n"; } .printf "After catch\n";  The error will cause the script to break out of the .catch block and display   the error, but continue executing the script after that block:  Script started                 ^ Syntax error in ';    invalid command; ' After catch  When inside a .catch block, one can explicitly exit it with the .leave com-  mand token.  Interestingly, .leave can be used to emulate a “break,” like in a loop:  r $t0=0; .catch {       .if  by @$ip  == 0xb9        {              .printf "found MOV ECX, ...\n";              r $t0 = dwo @$ip+1 ;              .leave;       }       .elsif  by @$ip  == 0xb8        {              .printf "found MOV EAX, ...\n";              r $t0 = dwo @$ip+1 ;              .leave;       }       $$ do some other analysis ...       .printf "Could not find the right opcode\n";       $$ do more stuff... } $$ Reached after the catch block is over, an error has  $$ occurred or a .leave is used  Repetition Structures  The DbgEng supports four repetition structures, which are described in the  following sections.  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 232      Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation   233  The .break command can be used to break out of a loop. Similarly, the .con- tinue command can be used to go to the next iteration within the encapsulating  repetition structure.  In the case of an erroneous repetition condition  the script or command exe-  N O T E  cutes endlessly , you can interrupt it by pressing Ctrl+C in any of the console debug- gers  kd, cdb, ntsd  or Ctrl+PauseBreak in WinDbg.  The for Loop The .for command token has the following syntax:  .for  InitialCommand ; Condition ; IncrementCommands  { Commands }  The following example script dumps the interrupt descriptor table  IDT  han- dlers using a for loop. First, we run the dt command to inspect the structure  of an IDTENTRY on a 32-bit system in a kernel-mode debug session:  kd> dt _KIDTENTRY ntdll!_KIDTENTRY    +0x000 Offset           : Uint2B    +0x002 Selector         : Uint2B    +0x004 Access           : Uint2B    +0x006 ExtendedOffset   : Uint2B  The script is as follows:  .for  r $t0=0; 1;r $t0=@$t0+1  {        $$ Take a typed pointer to the next IDT entry        r? $t1 = @@c++   _KIDTENTRY * @idtr  + @$t0 ;         $$ Last entry?        .if  @@c++ @$t1->Selector  == 0         {              $$ Break out              .break;        }         $$ Resolve the full address        r $t2  = @@c++  long    unsigned long @$t1->ExtendedOffset << 0x10  +                                unsigned long @$t1->Offset  ;         .printf "IDT[%02x] @ %p\n", @$t0, @$t2        $$ .printf "IDT[%02x] @ %p\n", @$t2 }  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 233   234   Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation  Some important aspects of the script to note:     The for loop’s condition is set to 1 so it loops indefi nitely. We will break  out conditionally from inside the loop’s body with the .break command.     The r? is used to assign a typed value to $t1.    The pseudo-register $t1 is a pointer to _KIDTENTRY. When $t0 is added  to it, this will advance to the appropriate memory location  taking into  consideration the size of _KIDTENTRY .     You determine the end of the IDT entries by examining the Selector fi eld   and breaking out of the loop accordingly.     The full base address of the IDT handler is computed by combining the   ExtendedOffset and Offset fi elds.     You cast $t2 to long so that it is properly sign extended  as pseudo-registers   are always 64-bit values .     Display the result.  If you fi nd using pseudo-registers like $t0 as a for loop counter a bit unusual  and instead want to use a name like i, j, or k, for example, then create a user- named alias called i that is equivalent to @$t0:  aS i @$t0;  .block {        .for  r ${i} = 1; ${i} <= 5; r ${i} = ${i}+1         {               .printf "i=%d\n", ${i}        } }  The while Loop The while loop is a simplifi ed form of a for loop that has neither an initial  command nor an increment command:  .while  Condition  { Commands }  Depending on the condition expression, the while loop’s body may not execute  at all. Here’s a sample script that traces 200 instructions in a newly started process:  $$ Go to entry point  skip NT process initialization  .printf "Going to entry point\n";  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 234      Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation   235  g @$exentry;  .printf "Started tracing...\n";  $$ Reset the counter r $t0 = 0;  .while  @$t0 <= 0n200  {        .printf "ip -> %p; ntrace=%d\n", @$ip, @$t0;        r $t0 = @$t0 + 1;        tr; }  .printf "Condition satisfied\n"; u @$ip L1;  Note that this is not the ideal way to do conditional tracing. The t and j com-  mands used together are a better approach.  The do-while Loop The do-while loop has the following syntax:  .do { Commands }  Condition   Unlike the while loop, the do loop’s body will execute at least once before the   condition is evaluated:  .do {         .if  by @$ip  == 0xb8         {               .printf "Found MOV EAX, ...\n";               .break;        }        $$ do other things        $$ ....        $$ .... }  0 ; .printf "Continue doing something else...\n";  The DbgEng also provides the z command to execute commands while a   certain condition holds true:  Command [ Command ; [Command ...;] ]; z  Expression    c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 235   236   Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation  In the following example, $t0 is used as a counter to trace fi ve  5  branching   instructions:  0:000> r $t0=1 0:000> th;r $t0=@$t0 + 1; z  @$t0 <= 5 ; redo [1] th;r $t0=@$t0 + 1; z  @$t0 <= 5 ; redo [1] th;r $t0=@$t0 + 1; z  @$t0 <= 5 ; redo [1] th;r $t0=@$t0 + 1; z  @$t0 <= 5 ; redo [1] th;r $t0=@$t0 + 1; z  @$t0 <= 5 ; 0:000> ? @$t0 Evaluate expression: 6 = 00000006  As in the preceding example, one or more commands can be specifi ed to the   left of the z command.  The foreach Loop The foreach loop is very useful and can be used to enumerate tokens read from  a fi le, from the output of a command or from a user-provided string.  Two common options can be passed  separately or together  as fi rst parameters   to the .foreach command token:      pS ExpressionValue—Initial number of tokens to skip when the loop  starts. This is equivalent to initializing the counter to a non-zero value  in a for loop.      ps ExpressionValue—The number of tokens to skip after each iteration.  This is equivalent to the for loop increment part where the programmer  can specify the counter increment value.  Tokenizing from a String The general syntax is as follows:  .foreach [Options]  s  TokenVariableName "InString"   { OutCommands }   For example, assume you are looking for *CreateFile*-related symbols in the  following three modules: ntdll, kernelbase, and kernel32. This is one way to do it:  .foreach  s  token "ntdll kernel32 kernelbase"  { x ${token}!*CreateFile*; }  In the next example, suppose you want to tokenize the contents of a given   ASCII string in memory:  aS  mu STR 0x8905e8 r $t0 = 0; .block {       .foreach  s  token "${STR}"         {   c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 236      Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation   237               .printf "token_i=%d, token_val=${token}\n", @$t0;              r $t0 = @$t0 + 1;       } }  The ${} is used to evaluate the token variable’s value. This is only necessary  only if the token is not surrounded by the space character at the time of evalu- ation. The .block was used in order to cause the alias STR to be evaluated.  Tokenizing from the Output of a Command The general syntax is as follows:  .foreach [Options]   Variable  { InCommands }   { OutCommands }  This use of .foreach is the most common because it enables extracting infor-  mation from a command’s output and using it in your script.  For the sake of demonstration, imagine a script that needs to allocate memory  in the process space of the debuggee and then uses that memory to read a fi le’s  contents to it.  First, examine the output of the memory allocation command .dvalloc:  0:000> .dvalloc 0n4096 Allocated 1000 bytes starting at 00620000  The output can be tokenized into six tokens; thus, the foreach loop should  use the  pS fl ag to skip the fi rst fi ve tokens and directly start with the last token   which is the newly allocated memory address :  0:000> .foreach  pS 5  token {.dvalloc 0x1000 }  { r $t0 = ${token}; .break; } 0:000> ? @$t0 Evaluate expression: 8323072 = 007f0000  The full script becomes the following:  $$ Set the image file name aS fileName @"c:\temp\shellcode.bin" .catch {        $$ Set the allocation size to be equal to the file we want to read        r $t0 = 0n880;         .foreach  pS 5  token {.dvalloc @$t0; }          {               r $t1 = token;              .break;         }         $$ Read the file        .readmem "${fileName}" @$t1 L@$t0;  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 237   238   Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation         .printf "Loaded ${fileName} @ %p\n", @$t1 }  N O T E  Remember to free the memory with the .dvfree command.  The next example parses the output of lm1m  which, by design, returns simpli-  fi ed output for use with .foreach :  0:000> lm1m image00400000 SHCORE KERNEL32 comctl32 user32 Ntdll  The foreach loop should look like this:  0:000> .foreach  modulename { lm1m; }  { .printf "Module name: modulename \n";}  Tokenizing from a File The general syntax is as follows:  .foreach [Options]  f   Variable  "InFile"   { OutCommands }  Assume a fi le called lines.txt with the following contents:  This is line 1 This is line 2 This is line 3  It will be tokenized as follows:  0:000> .foreach  f  line "c:\\temp\\lines.txt"  { .printf ">${line}<\n" } >This< >is< >line< >1< >This< >is< >line< >2< >This< >is< >line< >3<  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 238      Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation   239  Extension-Provided foreach Loops There are a few other foreach commands provided by extensions that are not  part of the scripting language. These foreach commands are implemented  inside various DbgEng extensions:     !for_each_frame—Executes a command for each frame in the stack of   the current thread     !for_each_function—Executes a command for each function in a given   module that matches the search pattern     !for_each_local—Executes a command for each local variable in the   current frame     !for_each_module—Executes a command for each loaded module    !for_each_process—Executes a command for each process  this exten-  sion works in kernel debugging only      !for_each_thread—Executes a command for each thread  kernel debug-  ging only   N O T E  Use the .extmatch *for_each* command to enumerate all the foreach  extension commands.  Each of those extension commands exposes special variables to the command  they execute. Please refer to the debugger manual to learn what variables are  exposed for each specifi c extension command.  The following example lists all modules and displays some information   about them:  !for_each_module .printf  D "%16p %16p: ${@ModuleName}  @ %p \n", ${@Base},${@End},  $iment 0x${@Base} , $iment 0x${@Base}            400000           408000: image00400000 @00406800         74b70000         74c78000: gdi32 @74b7afc5         75130000         75270000: KERNEL32 @7514a5cf         755d0000         75656000: comctl32 @755d1e15         75670000         757bf000: user32 @75685422         759b0000         76b28000: shell32 @759b108d         76c00000         76cbe000: msvcrt @76c0a9ed         76fa0000         77017000: ADVAPI32 @76fa1005  The entry point was computed with the $iment   operator. Also, the Debugger  Markup Language  DML  was used to make the entry point clickable. When  clicked it will unassemble the instructions at the entry point.   c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 239   240   Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation  The next example scans for all functions in ntdll that contain the File substring in their name:  !for_each_function -m:ntdll -p:*File* -c:.echo @SymbolName  N O T E  To run more commands, enclose them in quotes or just use one of the com- mands that run script ﬁ les.  Script Files Various commands can be used to instruct the DbgEng to run scripts. These  commands are split into two main categories:     Commands that open the script fi le, replace all new lines with a semico- lon  the command separator , and concatenate the whole contents into a  single command block. These commands have the following form: $><.    Commands that open the script fi le and interpret each line separately.   These commands have the following form: $<.  The former is very handy when using a debugger command that accepts other  commands as its arguments. For example, the bp command takes a breakpoint  action, which can be a simple command or a command that runs a script fi le   that contains various commands inside of it .  The latter interprets the contents of the script fi le line by line; each line could  contain various commands separated by a semicolon. Each command executed  will also be echoed in the debugger output.  Some debugger commands interpret the whole line, disregarding whether  there is a semicolon  ;  or not. This means that using the $><-related commands  will not work for such scripts. Consider the following example script:  r eax;r ebx r $.u0 = This is just a line .printf "$u0" r ecx;r edx  0:000> $><test.wds eax=00000000 ebx=00000000 0:000> ? $u0  Running this script with $>< does not work as intended:  Couldn't resolve error at 'This is just a line;.printf "";r ecx;r edx'  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 240      Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation   241  Conversely, running this particular script with $< works just fi ne:  0:000> $<test.wds 0:000> r eax;r ebx eax=00000000 ebx=00000000 0:000> r $.u0 = This is just a line 0:000> .printf "$u0" This is just a line0:000> r ecx;r edx ecx=f7fc0000 edx=00000000  The reason for this behavior is that when assigning a value to a fi xed-name  alias, semicolons will also be part of the assignment. This explains why in the  fi rst output, the script seems to have been suddenly stopped; it’s because $><  will concatenate all lines and separate them with a semicolon.  For the same reason, if you use a command that creates blocks and the curly  braces  { and }  are used on separate lines in the script fi le, $< will not work  properly:  .if  1 == 2  {        .printf "No way!\n"; } .else {        .printf "That's what I thought"; }  When executed, the preceding returns the following error:   1  0:000> $<blocktest.wds 0:000> .if  1 == 2                    ^ Syntax error in '.if  1 == 2 ' 0:000> {        ^ Syntax error in '{' 0:000>       .printf "No way!"; No way!0:000> }        ^ Syntax error in '}' 0:000> .else            ^ Syntax error in '.else' 0:000> {        ^ Syntax error in '{' 0:000>       .printf "That's what I thought"; That's what I thought0:000> }        ^ Syntax error in '}'  2  0:000> $><p:\book\scripts\t_blocktest.wds That's what I thought  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 241   242   Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation  N O T E  When the run script commands are preﬁ xed with an extra $, the script ﬁ le  name path can no longer contain semicolons. When a semicolon is found after $$><  or $$<, then whatever comes after it is interpreted as another set of commands.  To run a script fi le with its contents concatenated into a single command   block, use $> <:  $$><path_to\the_script.wds; r eax; al; bl;  Because $$>< is used, the semicolon allows the subsequent commands to be   executed.  Passing Arguments to Script Files  It is possible to pass arguments to scripts using the $$>a< command:  $$>a<path_to\the_script.wds arg1 arg2 …  The arguments can then be accessed in the script via the $argN aliases. The   alias $arg0 contains the script name  as in C’s argv[0] .  If you pass UDPRs as arguments, then they will not be expanded or evalu- ated before being passed to the script. This is a tricky situation and can lead to  various unexpected behaviors. For example, suppose you call a script like this:  $$>a<script.wds @$t1 @$t2  The preceding script will be passed the values @$t1 and @$t2 as ${$arg1}  and ${$arg2}, respectively. To solve this problem, assign the pseudo-registers to  a user-named alias and then call the script from a .block. This will guarantee  expansion of the alias values before they are passed to the script:  aS  x val1 @$t0 aS  x val2 @$t1 .block  {     $$>a<script.wds ${val1} ${val2} } ad  q val1 ad  q val2  To check whether an argument is present, use the .if" with "${ d:…}:  .catch {        .if ${ d:$arg1} == 0 or ${ d:$arg2} == 0        {               .printf "Usage: ${$arg0} memory-address len\n";               .leave;        }        r $t0 = ${$arg1};  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 242      Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation   243         .if $vvalid $t0, 1  == 0        {               .printf "Invalid memory address specified\n";               .leave;        }        r $t1 = @$t0 + ${$arg2} - 1;        .printf "Summing memory bytes from %x to %x\n", @$t0, @$t1;        .for  r $t3 = 0;@$t0 <= @$t1;r $t0 = @$t1 +1         {               r $t3 = @$t3 + by @$t1 ;        }        .printf "The result is %x\n", @$t3; }  We used a few tricks worthy of a brief explanation:     .catch and .leave were used to simulate a function start and “return”   like behavior.     .if and ${ d:$arg1} were used to check if the fi rst argument was defi ned.  Because we did not explicitly switch the evaluator syntax, the scripting  engine will evaluate using MASM; thus the operators used should all be  valid in MASM syntax. Enclosing an expression with @@c++ expression   will evaluate the expression using C++ syntax.     The $vvalid   operator is used to check if the passed memory address   is valid.     The .for command token is used to loop through the memory contents,  and each byte at that location is dereferenced using MASM’s by   operator.  In the following output, the script is passed various arguments:   1  0:000> $$>a<script.wds Usage: script.wds memory-address len  2  0:000> $$>a<script.wds 0xbadf00d Invalid memory address specified  3  0:000> $$>a<script.wds @eip 2 Summing memory bytes from 76f83bc5 to 76f83bc6 The result is eb  At marker 1, the script is executed without any arguments and it successfully  showed its arguments. At marker 2, the script is passed an invalid memory  address. Finally, at marker 3, the script is called correctly and the sum of the  bytes is returned.  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 243   244   Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation  N O T E  The .wds ﬁ le extension is not necessary. It is just a convention used by vari- ous script writers and stands for WinDbg Script ﬁ le.  Using Scripts Like Functions There is no way to defi ne functions in the DbgEng’s scripting language. However,  it is possible to use various script fi les as if they were functions. A script can  call itself recursively or call another script with another set of arguments, and  those arguments will be different in the context of each script.  UDPRs are very handy when writing a script. When a script calls another script,  those UDPRs will be common to all scripts and thus cannot be used exclusively  inside each script without disrupting the state of the other caller scripts, unless  of course they are saved and restored by the script in its entry and exit points.  N O T E  You can think of the need to preserve UDPRs in terms of registers in X86  or AMD64 programs, where the compiler ensures that it emits code that preserves  certain general-purpose registers upon the entry and the exit of each function while   depending on the calling convention  dedicating certain registers for input output of  the function.  With that in mind, it is important to devise a mechanism that allows us to  easily and seamlessly, and with as little repetition as possible, save restore  certain UDPRs anytime a script is going to call another.  The @call Script File Alias  In the previous section we outlined the necessity of having a way to save restore  UDRPs. For that reason, we devised two simple scripts that do just that. This  section illustrates both the init.wds and call.wds scripts and explains how  they work.  The init.wds script is used to set up the scripting environment and create   the short aliases to act like function names:   1  ad  q *;  2  aS ${ v:SCRIPT_PATH} @"p:\book\scripts"; .block {        $$ Callable scripts  using @call   3   c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 244      Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation   245         aS ${ v:sigma}      @"${SCRIPT_PATH}\sigma";        aS ${ v:pi}         @"${SCRIPT_PATH}\pi";        $$ Script call aliases  4         aS ${ v:@dvalloc}    @"$$>a<${SCRIPT_PATH}\dvalloc.wds";        aS ${ v:@call}       @"$$>a<${SCRIPT_PATH}\call.wds"; }  r $t19 = 0;  5  r $t18 = 1;  6   The init.wds script devises two user-named alias naming conventions:     Names prefi xed with @ denote aliases to the $$>a< command  run a script  with arguments . Normally those are scripts that are self-suffi cient.  They  do not need to preserve UDPRs and do not necessarily call themselves  or other scripts.      Names prefi xed with  designate an alias that can be called with the  @call alias. Those scripts can be recursive and can safely assume that all  the UDPRs other than those designated as return values will be saved  restored before after a script is called returns.  Marker 1 deletes all previously defi ned aliases. At marker 2, the script’s base  path is defi ned.  Note the use of @ to specify a literal string.  At marker 3, we  defi ne two user-named aliases prefi xed with  defi ned. These are callable via  the @call alias and evaluate to the full script path without the .wds extension.   The call script will append the extension.  For the sake of demonstration, two  callable scripts are defi ned: sigma and pi. At marker 4, we defi ne two user- named aliases prefi xed with @. These aliases simply resolve to $$>a< followed by  the full script path. The @call alias is what makes calling scripts as a function  possible. The @dvalloc is a wrapper around the .dvalloc command. Marker 5  defi nes the $t19 UDPR, which is used internally by call.wds script to remem- ber the script calls nesting level. The nesting level is used to form an alias that  will save all UDPRs per nest level. At marker 6, we defi ne UDPR $t18, which is  used internally by call.wds to determine how many UDPRs starting from $t0  should be skipped while restoring the saved UDPRs after a script call  more on  that in the following explanation .  Here is the call.wds script:  ad  q ${ v:_tn_}  1  .catch {        .if ${ d:$arg1} == 0  2         {               .printf "No script to call specified";               .leave;  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 245   246   Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation         }        $$ Compute the saved registers alias name of the previous call        aS  x ${ v:_tn_} @$t19;  3         .block        {               $$ Delete the saved registers alias name of the previous run               ad  q _sr_${_tn_};        }        r $t19 = @$t19 + 1; $$ Increment the nesting level  4          $$ Compute the saved registers alias name for the current run        aS  x ${ v:_tn_} @$t19;  5          $$ Save all pseudo-registers        .block        {  6                aS  c _sr_${_tn_} "r $t0,$t1,$t2,$t3,$t4,$t5,$t6,$t7,$t8,$t9, $t10,$t11,$t12,$t13,$t14,$t15,$t16,$t17";        }         $$ Call the script        .catch        { 7                $$>a<"${$arg1}.wds" ${ f:$arg2} ${ f:$arg3} ${ f:$arg4} ${ f:$arg5} ${ f:$arg6} ${ f:$arg7} ${ f:$arg8} ${ f:$arg9} ${ f:$arg10}  ${ f:$arg11} ${ f:$arg12} ${ f:$arg13} ${ f:$arg14} ${ f:$arg15}  ${ f:$arg16} ${ f:$arg17} ${ f:$arg18} ${ f:$arg19} ${ f:$arg20};        }         $$ Restore the registers after calling        .block        {                8                $$ Compute the saved registers alias name               aS  x ${ v:_tn_} @$t19;                .block               {                      $$ Restore all registers except the first ones that                       $$ are due to return a value                      .foreach  pS @$t18  s  X "_sr_${_tn_}"    9                       {                             r ${X};  10                       }               }                $$ Delete the saved registers alias name               ad  q _sr_${_tn_};  11                 $$ Decrease the nesting level               r $t19 = @$t19 - 1;  12         } } ad  q ${ v:_tn_};  13   c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 246      Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation   247  This script needs two UDPRs for special purposes. The fi rst is $t19, which  is used to store the call nesting level. It is incremented each time @call is used  to run a script, and decremented when the script fi nishes execution. Because  $t19 is incremented and decremented, you can create an alias with a unique  name per nesting level to store the UDPR values.  The second UDPR is $t18, which is used to designate the count of UDPRs  used to return values  starting from $t0 . By default, the value 1 indicates that  $t0 is the only register to be used as a return value. If the script returns more  than one value  for example, in $t0 and $t1 , then the caller has to set $t18 to 2  before calling the script. This guarantees that neither $t0 nor $t1 will be reverted  back to their original values  the values before the script was called . The call  script takes the script name to be called as the fi rst argument, followed by the  rest of the arguments  $arg2 through $argN .  Now we briefl y explain how the rest of this script works before putting it into  action. At marker 1, we delete the user-named alias _tn_  used to compute a  per-nesting-level alias name  before redefi ning it. Marker 2 checks if a param- eter was passed to the script. At marker 3 and 4, we assign to the _tn_ alias the  numeric value of the nesting level  note the use of aS  x , and then we increment  the nesting level UDPR $t19. At marker 5, we create a temporary alias that has  the value of the current nesting level.  At marker 6, we save UDPRs $t0 through $t17 into an alias named _sr_{_tn_}  by using aS  c followed by the r command and the list of UDPRs to return  their values. For instance, if the nesting level is 2, the saved register’s alias name  will be _sr_2 and will contain the values of all UDPRs in question. _sr_0x2  will equate to $t0=00000003 $t1=00000000 $t2=00000000 … $t17=00000000. At markers 7 and 8, the script that was passed into $arg1 is called with the  rest of the arguments that were passed. After the script returns, re-compute  the _tn_ alias.  The alias could have been overwritten by the called script.   At markers 9 and 10, we iterate in the current _sr_NESTING_LEVEL alias but  skip $t18 tokens  note the  pS switch , and then restore each UDPR with the r  command.  At markers 11–13, we clean up the saved registers alias   _sr_NESTING_LEVEL ,   decrement the nesting level, and delete the temporary name alias.  The next step is to run the init.wds script that will create the appropriate   aliases:  0:000> ad  q *; $$><p:\book\scripts\init.wds; al;   Alias            Value    -------          -------   pi              "p:\book\scripts\pi"   sigma           "p:\book\scripts\sigma"   test            "p:\book\scripts\test"   @call            $$>a<"p:\book\scripts\call.wds"   @dvalloc         $$>a<"p:\book\scripts\dvalloc.wds"   SCRIPT_PATH      p:\book\scripts  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 247   248   Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation  Another way to do that is to run WinDbg  or cdb  with the -c command-line   switch:  c:\dbg\windbg.exe -c "ad  q *;$$><p:\book\scripts\init.wds;al;" p:\test.exe  You can now tell that you have two aliases for @call and @dvalloc that are  scripts that do not require automatic save restore of UDPRs, and three other  scripts that rely on @call to automatically save restore UDPRs, and they act  like “functions.”  The sigma.wds script takes two numeric parameters and returns the sum   of terms between the fi rst and second argument, returning the result in $t0:  .for  r $t0=0, $t1=${$arg1}, $t2=${$arg2}; @$t1 <= @$t2; r $t1 = @$t1 + 1  {        r $t0 = @$t0 + @$t1; }  To execute sigma.wds, use @call sigma start_num end_num, as follows:  0:000> @call sigma 1 4;.printf "The result is %d\n", @$t0 The result is 10  Similarly, the script pi.wds returns the multiplication result of the terms   between the fi rst and second argument:  .for  r $t0=1, $t1=${$arg1}, $t2=${$arg2}; @$t1 <= @$t2; r $t1 = @$t1 + 1  {        r $t0 = @$t0 * @$t1; }  The dvalloc.wds script is a wrapper around the .dvalloc command. When   @dvalloc is called, the result is returned in $t0 so it can be used in scripts:  .catch {        r $t0 = -1; $$ Set invalid result        .if ${ d:$arg1} == 0        {               .printf "Usage: dvalloc.wds memory-size\n";               .printf "The allocated memory is returned in t0\n";               .leave;        }         $$ Allocate memory and set result into $t0        .foreach  pS 5  t {.dvalloc ${$arg1}}          {               .if $vvalid ${t}, 1  == 1               {                      r $t0 = ${t};                       .leave;   c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 248      Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation   249                }               } }  After allocating memory with .dvalloc, we tokenize the result and parse   out the memory address into $t0.  Both sigma.wds and pi.wds are sample functions that use the $t1 and $t2  UDPRs. That means if a script calls sigma or pi, then $t1 and $t2 should not be  modifi ed in any way upon returning from both the functions back to the caller.  You can verify this behavior with the following simple test.wds script:  r $t1 = 0x123; r $t2 = 0x456;  .printf "Before calling sigma: t1=%x, t2=%x\n", @$t1, @$t2 @call sigma 1 3 .printf "After calling sigma: the result is t0=%x, t1=%x, t2=%x\n",          @$t0, @$t1, @$t2  The preceding script assigns values to UDPRs $t1 and $t2 and then calls  sigma 1 3, which will modify $t1 and $t2. If @call works as expected, then  those UDPRs are restored just after the call:  0:000> @call test Before calling sigma: t1=123, t2=456 After calling sigma: the result is t0=6, t1=123, t2=456  Example Debug Scripts In this section you will make use of various helpful scripts, putting into practice  all that you have learned so far.  Getting the Image Base of a Speciﬁ ed Module  One quick way to get the image base of a module is to use the lm  list modules   command with the m switch to list modules matching the specifi ed pattern:  0:000> lm m kernel32 start    end        module name 749e0000 74b20000   KERNEL32    deferred                From the output, you can tell that at the fi fth token you have the image base.  Thus, the image base can be easily parsed with .foreach by skipping the fi rst   tokens, extracting the value of the fi fth token, and breaking out of the loop:  r $t0 = -1; .foreach  pS 4   imgbase { lmm ${$arg1}; }    {  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 249   250   Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation         r @$t0 = ${imgbase};         .break; }  Writing a Basic UPX Unpacker  Writing a UPX unpacker is pretty simple, and there are many ways to do it.  The method used here is elaborate in order to exercise various debugger com- mands. It is assumed that you have basic PE fi le format knowledge to properly  understand the script.  The idea behind the script is as follows:    1.  UPX packs the program and moves the original entry point  OEP  away   from the .text section, which is the fi rst section.    2.  The script calculates the bounds of the fi rst section and starts tracing.   3.  If instruction pointer  EIP  is outside of the program image, then the script   issues a gu to return to the caller.    4.  Tracing continues until EIP is inside the fi rst section. At that point, it is   assumed that the program has been unpacked.  Here is the script:  $$ Get image base $$ Get image base aS  x IMG_BASE @@c++ @$peb->ImageBaseAddress ;  1  $$ Declare some user-named aliases that equate to UDPRs aS SEC_START   @$t19;  2  aS SEC_END   @$t18; aS IMG_START   @$t17; aS IMG_END   @$t16;  $$ Go to the program entrypoint g @$exentry  .catch {    $$ Get pointer to NT headers  3  r $t0 = ${IMG_BASE} + @@c++   _IMAGE_DOS_HEADER * ${IMG_BASE} ->e_lfanew      $$ Now from the IMAGE_NT_HEADERS.FileHeader, get the size of optional  header  4    r $t1 = @@c++    !_IMAGE_NT_HEADERS* @$t0 ->FileHeader.SizeOfOptionalHeader       $$ Compute the address to the first section    $$ skip signature, size of file headers and size of optional headers    r $t2 = @$t0 + 4 + @@c++ sizeof ole32!_IMAGE_FILE_HEADER   + @$t1;  5   c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 250      Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation   251     $$  6  Get first section boundaries    r ${SEC_START} = IMG_BASE +                   @@c++   _IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER * @$t2 ->VirtualAddress ;    r ${SEC_END} = IMG_BASE +                   @@c++   _IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER * @$t2 ->Misc.VirtualSize ;     $$ Compute the image bounds  7     r ${IMG_START} = IMG_BASE;     r ${IMG_END} = IMG_START +                   @@c++   _IMAGE_NT_HEADERS * @$t0 ->OptionalHeader.SizeOfIm- age ;     $$ The logic is as follows:    $$ 1. Trace    $$ 2. If IP is outside of image then "gu"    .for  r $t0=0; 1; r $t0 = @$t0 + 1   8     {     $$ Trace once more to see where it leads  9      t;      $$ IP outside image boundaries?     .if  @$ip   ${IMG_END}   10      {        gu;        .continue;     }      $$ IP within the first section?     .if  @$ip >= ${SEC_START}  and  @$ip <= ${SEC_END}   11      {        .printf "--- Reach first section ---\n";        u;        .break;     }    } }   At marker 1, we take the image base of the current running program from  the $peb typed pseudo-register by accessing its ImageBaseAddress fi eld using  the C++ evaluator, and then store it in an alias called IMG_BASE.  At marker 2, we create a bunch of user-named aliases that correspond to  some UDPRs. This is a nice trick to give names to those UDPRs. At marker 3,  we assign the address of the _IMAGE_NT_HEADERS to the $t0 UDPR by adding  the image base to the value of the fi eld in IMAGE_DOS_HEADER.e_lfanew.   At marker 4, we retrieve the size of the optional headers into the $t1 UDPR.  This will be useful to skip over all the PE headers and land in the fi rst image  section header.  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 251   252   Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation  At marker 5, we compute the address of fi rst image section into the $t2 UDPR.  At marker 6, we parse from the IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER both the section virtual  address  section start  and the section end  section start + section size .  At marker 7, we compute the program’s start and end addresses. The start  address is the image base, and the end address is the image base plus the con- tents of the IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER.SizeOfImage fi eld.  At marker 8, we start looping infi nitely using a for loop, $t0 as the counter,   and the value 1 as the condition.  At markers 9–11, we use the t command to trace a single instruction. Don’t  trace if EIP is not within the image’s boundaries and stop tracing if the EIP is  within the fi rst section’s boundaries.  Although this method is too long, it illustrates how to write a more complex   tracing script and logic in case the unpacking process is more sophisticated.  The following is a simpler version of the unpacker that searches for a code  pattern that is executed just before the program is about to transition to the  original entry point  OEP :  $$ UPX unpack w  pattern $$ UPX1:0107D7F5 39 C4                cmp     esp, eax $$ UPX1:0107D7F7 75 FA                jnz     short loc_107D7F3 $$ UPX1:0107D7F9 83 EC 80             sub     esp, -80h $$ UPX1:0107D7FC E9 ?? ?? ??          jmp     near ptr word_103FC62  $$ Go to program entry point  not the original entry point, but the packed  one  $$ only if no arguments were specified .if ${ d:$arg1} == 0 {        g @$exentry; }  $$ Pattern not found! r $t0 = 0;  1  .foreach  addr { s -[1]b @$ip L200 39 c4 75 fa 83 EC}   2  {        $$ Pattern found!        r $t0 = 1;        r $t1 = ${addr} + 7;  3         .printf  D "The JMP to OEP @ %x \n",@$t1,@$t1;        4         ga @$t1;        5         t; u;        .break; }  .if $t0 == 0 {    .printf "Could not find OEP jump pattern. Is the program packed by  UPX?\n"; }  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 252      Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation   253  At marker 1, we use the $t0 UDPR as a Boolean variable to indicate whether   the pattern was found.  At marker 2, we search for the pattern starting from the entry point and for  at most 200 bytes using the 1 fl ag with the search command s. This will return  just the address where the match occurred. If no match is found, an empty string  is returned and thus the .foreach has nothing to tokenize.  At marker 3, we skip seven bytes past the matched pattern location to point to  the long relative jump  which jumps back to the OEP . Store that address into $t1. At markers 4 and 5, we run the program until the JMP OEP instruction is  reached  the ga command was used, so a hardware breakpoint is used rather  than a software breakpoint , and then we trace once over the JMP OEP instruc- tion and thus reach the fi rst instruction of the unpacked program.  Writing a Basic File Monitor  This example creates a script that illustrates how to use scripts in combination  with conditional breakpoints to track all calls to ASCII and Unicode versions  of various fi le I O API functions: CreateFile, DeleteFile, GetFileAttributes,  CopyFile, and so on.  The script is designed to be called once with the init parameter to initialize  it and then multiple times as a command to the breakpoints it creates when it  initializes.  The following parameters are passed when the script is called from the   breakpoint:     ApiName—Used for display purposes only.    IsUnicode—Pass zero to specify that this is the ASCII version of the API,   and pass one to specify that it is the Unicode version.     FileNamePointerIndex—The parameter number on the stack that contains   the pointer to the fi lename buffer     ApiID—An ID of your choice, this parameter is optional. This is helpful  if you want to add extra logic when this breakpoint occurs. In this script,  CreateFile[AW] is given the ID 5. Later you check whether this API is  triggered, and then check what fi lename is accessed and act accordingly.  Here is the contents of the bp_displayfn.wds script:  .catch {        .if '${$arg1}' == 'init'  1         {  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 253   254   Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation                2                bp kernelbase!CreateFileA @"$$>a<${$arg0} CreateFileA 0 1 5";               bp kernelbase!CreateFileW @"$$>a<${$arg0} CreateFileW 1 1 5";                              3                bp kernelbase!DeleteFileA @"$$>a<${$arg0} DeleteFileW 0 1";               bp kernelbase!DeleteFileW @"$$>a<${$arg0} DeleteFileW 1 1";               bp kernelbase!FindFirstFileA @"$$>a<${$arg0} FindFirstFileA 0 1";               bp kernelbase!FindFirstFileW @"$$>a<${$arg0} FindFirstFileW 1 1";               bp kernel32!MoveFileA @"$$>a<${$arg0} MoveFileA 0 1";               bp kernel32!MoveFileW @"$$>a<${$arg0} MoveFileW 1 1";               bp kernelbase!GetFileAttributesA                        @"$$>a<${$arg0} GetFileAttributesA 0 1";               bp kernelbase!GetFileAttributesExA                        @"$$>a<${$arg0} GetFileAttributesExA 0 1";               bp kernelbase!GetFileAttributesExW                        @"$$>a<${$arg0} GetFileAttributesExW 1 1";               bp kernel32!CopyFileA @"$$>a<${$arg0} CopyFileA 0 1";               bp kernel32!CopyFileW @"$$>a<${$arg0} CopyFileW 1 1";                $$ Ignore some debug events  to lessen output pollution                sxi ld;                $$ Display the list of the newly installed breakpoints               bl;               4                .leave;        }        5         $$ Display API name        .printf "${$arg1}: >";        6         $$ Fetch the file name pointer         r $t0 = poi @$csp + 4 * ${$arg3} ;        7          $$ Is it a unicode string pointer?        .if ${$arg2} == 1        {               8                .printf "%mu<\n", @$t0;        }        .else        {               $$ Display as ASCII SZ  9                .printf "%ma<\n", @$t0;        }         $$ ApiID parameter set?  10         .if ${ d:$arg4} == 1        {               $$ ID of CreateFile API?  11                .if ${$arg4} == 5  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 254      Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation   255                {                      $$ Grab the name of the file so we compare it                      aS  mu ${ v:FILE_NAME} @$t0;  12                       .block                      {                            13                              .if $sicmp @"${FILE_NAME}", @"c:\temp\eb.txt"  == 0                             {                                    .leave;  14                              }                      }                      ad  q ${ v:FILE_NAME};               }        }         $$ Continue after breakpoint        gc;  15  }  At marker 1, we check whether the script is called with init; if so, then ini- tialize the script  markers 2–4  and exit the script. At marker 2, we create two  breakpoints for CreateFileA W and set the condition to be the script itself, and  pass ApiID = 5.  At markers 3 and 4, we add breakpoints for the rest of the APIs without pass- ing the ApiID argument, and then return from the script. At markers 5 and 6,  we print the API name then assign into $t0 the pointer of the fi lename  using  the passed parameter index . At markers 7–9, we check if the script is called for  the ASCII or Unicode version of the API and then appropriately use the %mu or  the %ma format specifi er. At markers 10–12, we check if an ApiID was passed  and is the CreateFile ApiID.  At markers 12–14, we extract the fi lename into an alias called FILE_NAME, create  a block so that the alias is expanded properly, and then compare the FILE_NAME  alias against a desired fi le path.  Notice the use of @ to indicate literal string  expansion.  If the path matches what we are looking for, the script terminates  and suspends execution. Finally, at marker 15, the script will resume execution  after any of the defi ned breakpoint is reached.  To use this script, run it with the init parameter fi rst:  0:000> $$>a<P:\book\scripts\bp_displayfn.wds init; g;  Writing a Basic String Descrambler  This script implements a simple descrambling routine. Imagine the C scrambling  routine is as follows:  void descramble unsigned char *p, size_t sz  {   for  size_t i=0;i<sz;i++, ++p   c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 255   256   Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation    {       *p = *p ^  235 +  i & 1  ;   } }  N O T E  The descrambling routine can be more sophisticated. If the routine involves  the use of tables and whatnot, remember that you have access to those tables because  the script has full access to the debuggee’s memory.  The following is the same routine implemented using the DbgEng’s scripting  language. Note how it makes use of the @@c++ evaluator to easily mimic the  original algorithm:  .catch {        $$ Take the Source        r $t0 = ${$arg1};         $$ Take the Destination        r $t1 = ${$arg2};         $$ Take the Size        r $t2 = ${$arg3};         .for  r $t3=0; @$t3<@$t2; r $t3 = @$t3 + 1, $t0 = @$t0+1, $t1=@$t1+1         {               r $t4 = @@c++  * unsigned char * @$t0  ^  235 +  @$t3 & 1   ;               eb @$t1 @$t4;        }        $$ Display the descrambled result        db ${$arg2} L ${$arg3}; }  The scrambled memory contents is as follows:  0:000> db 0x4180a4 L 30 004180a4  bb 9e 8a 8f 9f 85 88 8d-87 cc 99 89 9d 89 99 9f  ................ 004180b4  8e cc 8e 82 8c 85 85 89-8e 9e 82 82 8c ec eb ec  ................ 004180c4  eb ec eb ec eb ec eb ec-eb ec eb ec eb ec eb ec  ................

The SDK that ships with the debugging tools  provides another way to automate or extend the debugger. It ships with header  fi les, library fi les to link your extension with, and various examples that show  you how to use the DbgEng programmatically.  The SDK is found in the sdk subdirectory where the debugging tools are   installed. It has the following directory structure:     Help—Contains references to the DbgHelp library.    Inc—Contains the includes needed when using the SDK.    Lib—Contains the appropriate library fi les used during the linking build  stage. It contains libraries for WOA  Windows on ARM , AMD64, and i386.    Samples—Contains samples of various examples written using the different  frameworks that can be used to write debugger extensions. There are also  samples on how to use the DbgEng instead of writing an extension for it.  Although covering the SDK is beyond the scope of this chapter, the following  sections briefl y discuss how to use the SDK to write DbgEng extensions for the  debugger. The material covered should be just enough to give you a head start,  making it easy for you to understand the sample extensions and start learning  and writing your own.  To begin, you should know that the SDK provides three frameworks with   which you can write extensions:     WdbgExts extension framework—These are the original WinDbg exten- sions. To interact with the DbgEng, they require exporting a few callbacks  in order to work with the WinDbg Extension APIs instead of the debug- ger client interface. The programmer can later acquire a debugger client  interface or other interfaces on demand if more functionality is required.    DbgEng extension framework—These newer types of extensions can  provide extra functionality to the extension writer. The extension com- mands have access to a debugger client interface instance that enables  them to acquire other interfaces and interact further with the DbgEng.     EngExtCpp extensions—Built on top of the DbgEng extension framework,  these extensions are created by subclassing the ExtExtension base class.  The ExtExtension class provides a variety of utility functions that enable  the extension to perform complex tasks.  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 257   258   Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation  The following sections briefl y illustrate how to write extensions using the  WdbgExts extension framework. Please note that writing extensions using either  of the other frameworks is fairly straightforward and can be done by following  the SDK samples that ship with the Debugging Tools package.  Concepts This section describes two methods for accessing the DbgEng APIs:     Via the debugger interfaces, which can be retrieved using a debug client   object instance.     Via a structure passed to the WbgExts extension initialization callback.  The structure contains a set of API function pointers that can be used by  the extension.  The Debugger Interfaces  The DbgEng provides seven base interfaces to be used by the programmer.  Over time, more functionality has been added, and in order to preserve back- ward compatibility, new versions of those interfaces have been introduced. For  example, at the time of writing, IDebugControl is the fi rst interface version and  IDebugControl4 is the latest version of this interface.  Following is the list of interfaces and a brief explanation of their purpose and   some of the functions they provide:     IDebugClient5—This interface provides various useful functions to start  or stop a debugging session and set the necessary DbgEng callbacks   input output events . In addition, its QueryInterface method is used  to retrieve interfaces of the remaining interfaces.    CreateProcess AttachProcess—Creates a new process or attaches   to an existing one:     AttachKernel—Attaches to a live kernel debugger.    GetExitCode—Returns the exit code of a process.    OpenDumpFile—Starts a debugging session from a dump fi le.    SetInputCallbacks SetEventCallbacks—Sets the input output   callbacks.     IDebugControl4—This interface provides process-control-related functions:     AddBreakpoint—Adds a breakpoint.    Execute—Executes a debugger command.  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 258      Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation   259     SetInterrupt—Signals the DbgEng to break into the target.    WaitForEvent—Waits until a debugger event occurs. This is similar to   the WaitForDebugEvent   Win32 API.     SetExecutionStatus—Sets the DbgEng’s status. This allows the pro-  grammer to resume execution, request a step into or step over, etc.     IDebugDataSpaces4—This interface provides memory and data-related   functionality:    ReadVirtual—Reads memory from the target’s virtual memory.    QueryVirtual—Equivalent to Win32’s VirtualQuery  , this function   queries the virtual memory of the target’s virtual address space.     ReadMsr—Reads the model-specifi c register value.    WritePhysical—Writes physical memory.     IDebugRegisters2—Provides register introspection  enumeration, infor- mation query  and set get functionality. The DbgEng assigns registers an  index. To work with a named register you have to fi rst fi gure out its index:    GetDescription—Returns a description of the register  size, name,   type, etc. .     SetValue GetValue—Sets gets the value of a register.    GetIndexByName—Finds a register index given its name.     IDebugSymbols3—Provides functionality to deal with debugging symbols,   source line information, querying types, etc:    GetImagePath—Returns the executable image path.    GetFieldName—Returns the name of a fi eld within a structure.     IDebugSystemObjects4—Provides functionality to query information   from the debugged target s  and the system it runs on:     GetCurrentProcessId—Returns the DbgEng process id of the currently   debugged process.  process.     GetCurrentProcessHandle—Returns the system handle of the current      SetCurrentThreadId—Switches the current thread given its DbgEng   id. This is equivalent to the ~Nk command.     IDebugAdvanced4—Provides more functionality not necessarily present   in the other interfaces:    GetThreadContext SetThreadContext—Gets sets the thread context.    GetSystemObjectInformation—Returns information about the desired   system object.  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 259   260   Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation  In order to use the APIs via the interfaces, you need to have an instance of  the IDebugClient  debugger client  interface or any of its derived interfaces. In  the following code snippet, the IDebugClient5 interface instance is passed to  the CreateInterfaces utility function. The latter then calls QueryInterface  repetitively to retrieve the needed interfaces:  bool CreateInterfaces IDebugClient5 *Client  {      Interfaces already created?   if  Control != NULL      return true;       Get the debug client interface   if  Client == NULL    {     m_LastHr=m_pDebugCreate __uuidof IDebugClient5 , void** &Client ;     if  m_LastHr != S_OK        return false;   }         Query for some other interfaces that we'll need.     do     {       m_LastHr = Client->QueryInterface          __uuidof IDebugControl4 ,           void** &Control ;       if  m_LastHr != S_OK          break;       m_LastHr = Client->QueryInterface          __uuidof IDebugSymbols3 ,           void** &Symbols ;       if  m_LastHr != S_OK          break;       m_LastHr = Client->QueryInterface          __uuidof IDebugRegisters2 ,           void** &Registers ;       if  m_LastHr != S_OK          break;       m_LastHr = Client->QueryInterface          __uuidof IDebugSystemObjects4 ,           void** &SystemObjects ;       if  m_LastHr != S_OK          break;       m_LastHr = Client->QueryInterface          __uuidof IDebugAdvanced3 ,           void** &Advanced ;       if  m_LastHr != S_OK          break;       m_LastHr = Client->QueryInterface          __uuidof IDebugDataSpaces4 ,           void** &DataSpace ;     } while   false ;  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 260      Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation   261    return SUCCEEDED m_LastHr ; }  The interface variables are defi ned like this:  IDebugDataSpaces4    *DataSpace; IDebugRegisters2     *Registers; IDebugSymbols3       *Symbols; IDebugControl4       *Control; IDebugSystemObjects4 *SystemObjects; IDebugAdvanced3      *Advanced;  To acquire a debugger client interface  IDebugClient , use either the DebugCreate  function or the DebugConnect  connect to a remote host  function. The following  example acquires a debugger client interface using DebugCreate:  HRESULT Status; IDebugClient *Client; if   Status = DebugCreate __uuidof IDebugClient ,                            void** &Client   != S_OK  {     printf "DebugCreate failed, 0x%X\n", Status ;     return -1; }    Okay, now ready to query for other interfaces...  WinDbg Extension APIs  Debugger extensions receive a pointer to a WINDBG_EXTENSION_APIS structure  via the WinDbgExtensionDllInit extension initialization callback routine. The  structure has the following API pointers:     wdbgexts.h typedef struct _WINDBG_EXTENSION_APIS {     ULONG                                  nSize;     PWINDBG_OUTPUT_ROUTINE                 lpOutputRoutine;     PWINDBG_GET_EXPRESSION                 lpGetExpressionRoutine;     PWINDBG_GET_SYMBOL                     lpGetSymbolRoutine;     PWINDBG_DISASM                         lpDisasmRoutine;     PWINDBG_CHECK_CONTROL_C                lpCheckControlCRoutine;     PWINDBG_READ_PROCESS_MEMORY_ROUTINE    lpReadProcessMemoryRoutine;     PWINDBG_WRITE_PROCESS_MEMORY_ROUTINE   lpWriteProcessMemoryRoutine;     PWINDBG_GET_THREAD_CONTEXT_ROUTINE     lpGetThreadContextRoutine;     PWINDBG_SET_THREAD_CONTEXT_ROUTINE     lpSetThreadContextRoutine;     PWINDBG_IOCTL_ROUTINE                  lpIoctlRoutine;     PWINDBG_STACKTRACE_ROUTINE             lpStackTraceRoutine; } WINDBG_EXTENSION_APIS, *PWINDBG_EXTENSION_APIS;  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 261   262   Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation  When the extension receives this structure, it should copy and store it in a  global variable, preferably named ExtensionApis. The reason to choose this  particular variable name is because the header fi le wdbgexts.h defi nes some  macros that refer to ExtensionApis to access the API pointers:  extern WINDBG_EXTENSION_APIS ExtensionApis;  define dprintf           ExtensionApis.lpOutputRoutine  define GetExpression     ExtensionApis.lpGetExpressionRoutine  define CheckControlC     ExtensionApis.lpCheckControlCRoutine  define GetContext        ExtensionApis.lpGetThreadContextRoutine  ... define ReadMemory        ExtensionApis.lpReadProcessMemoryRoutine  define WriteMemory       ExtensionApis.lpWriteProcessMemoryRoutine  define StackTrace        ExtensionApis.lpStackTraceRoutine   These macros enable extension writers to directly call StackTrace or  WriteMemory, for instance, instead of using pExtension.lpStackTraceRoutine  or pExtension.WriteMemory.  Apart from being able to use only the functions declared in the WINDBG_ EXTENSION_APIS structure, it is also possible to use a whole range of other  functions that are based on the ExtensionApis.lpIoctlRoutine function.  For example, ReadPhysical   is an inline function that calls IoCtl   with the  IG_READ_PHYSICAL control code while passing it the appropriate parameters.  Please refer to the DbgEng help fi le for a list of functions that you can use   inside WdbgExts extensions.  Writing Debugging Tools Extensions In the previous section you learned the concepts behind the SDK; now you are  ready to delve into more details about what a WdbgExts extension looks like  and how to write a very basic extension.  A debugger extension is simply a Microsoft Windows DLL. The DLL has to  export two mandatory functions needed by the DbgEng and then export as  many functions as the extension is providing to the debugger.  The fi rst function that should be exported is WinDbgExtensionDllInit. It is   called when the debugger loads your extension:  VOID WinDbgExtensionDllInit      PWINDBG_EXTENSION_APIS lpExtensionApis,     USHORT MajorVersion,     USHORT MinorVersion  {     ExtensionApis = *lpExtensionApis;    Take a copy         Optionally also save the version information      SavedMajorVersion = MajorVersion;   c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 262      Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation   263      SavedMinorVersion = MinorVersion;      return; }  Notice that you save the passed lpExtensionApis pointer contents. The passed  version information variables denote the Microsoft Windows build type and  build number, respectively. Optionally save those variables if you want to check  their values in the extension commands later.  The second function that should be exported is ExtensionApiVersion. It is  called by the DbgEng when it wants to query the version information from  your extension:  EXT_API_VERSION ApiVersion =  {    5,    Major   1,    Minor   EXT_API_VERSION_NUMBER64,     Revision   0    Reserved };  LPEXT_API_VERSION ExtensionApiVersion VOID  {   return &ApiVersion; }  Now that the mandatory functions  or callbacks  have been defi ned, you   proceed by declaring the extension commands.  An extension command has the following declaration:  CPPMOD VOID myextension     HANDLE                 hCurrentProcess,   HANDLE                 hCurrentThread,   ULONG                  dwCurrentPc,   ULONG                  dwProcessor,   PCSTR                  args   The most notable passed arguments are as follows:    dwProcessor—The index of the current processor    dwCurrentPc—The current instruction pointer    args—The arguments passed  if any   Another preferred way to declare an extension function is to use the DECLARE_  API api_s  macro:  DECLARE_API  test   {   dprintf "This is a test extension routine" ; }  c04.indd  08:34:9:AM  01 21 2014  Page 263   264   Chapter 4   Debugging and Automation  N O T E  At any time, any extension command can call DebugCreate  and then get  any interface it wants in order to gain extra functionality.   The fi nal step is to export the two mandatory functions and the extension  commands that you plan to expose to the DbgEng. The usual way is to create a  .def fi le and call the linker with an additional  DEF:filename.def switch. This  is what the DEF fi le for the test extension we wrote looks like:  EXPORTS    ; Callbacks provided for the debugger   WinDbgExtensionDllInit   ExtensionApiVersion    ; Command callbacks   test  Place the resulting DLL in the debugging tools directory  or in the winext  subdirectory  or in the Windows system directory. Use !load extname to load  your compiled extension and then !extension_command or !extname.ext_com- mand to execute the extension command.  Useful Extensions, Tools, and Resources  Following is a short list of useful extensions, tools, and resources that can enhance  your debugging experience:     narly  https:  code.google.com p narly  —A handy extension that lists   SAFESEH handlers, displays information about  GS and DEP, searches for  ROP gadgets, and provides other miscellaneous commands.

The situation gets even worse when the code has been hardened, delib- erately constructed to resist analysis. We refer to such techniques for hardening  programs under the general umbrella of obfuscation. Some examples of situations  in which obfuscation might be applied are as follows:     Malware—Avoiding the scrutiny of both antivirus detection engines  and reverse engineers is a primary motive of the criminals who employ  malware in their operations, and therefore this has been a traditional  application of obfuscation for many years now.     Protection of intellectual property—Many commercial programs have  some sort of protection against unauthorized duplication. Some systems  employ further obfuscation for the purpose of obscuring the implementa- tion details of certain parts of the system. Good examples include Skype,  Apple’s IMessage, or even the Dropbox client, which protect their com- munication protocol formats with obfuscation and cryptography.  267  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 267   268   Chapter 5   Obfuscation     Digital Rights Management—DRM schemes commonly protect certain  crucial pieces of information  e.g., cryptographic keys and protocols  using  obfuscation. Apple’s FairPlay, Microsoft’s Media Foundation Platform and  its PlayReader DRM, to cite only two, are examples of obfuscation applica- tion. Currently, this is the leading contemporary application of obfuscation.  Speaking in the abstract, “obfuscation” can be viewed in terms of program  transformations. The goal of such methods is to take as input a program, and  produce as output a new program that has the same computational effect as the  original program  formally speaking, this property is called semantic equivalence  or computational equivalence , but at the same time it is “more diffi cult” to analyze. The notion of “diffi culty of analysis” has long been defi ned informally, without  any backing mathematical rigor. For example, it is widely believed that—insofar  as a human analyst is concerned—a program’s size is an indicator of the diffi culty  in analyzing it. A program that consumes 20,000 instructions in performing a  single operation might be thought to be “more diffi cult” to analyze than one  that takes one instruction to perform the same operation. Such assumptions are  dubious and have attracted the scrutiny of theoreticians  such as that by Mila  Dalla Preda17 and Barak et al.2 .   Several models have been proposed to represent an obfuscator, and  in a  dual way  a deobfuscator. These models are useful to improve the design of  obfuscation tools and to reason about their robustness, through adapted criteria.  Among them, two models are of special interest.   The fi rst model is suited for the analysis of cryptographic mechanisms, in  the so-called white box attack context. This model defi nes an attacker as a proba- bilistic algorithm that tries to deduce a pertinent property from a protected  program. More precisely, it tries to extract information other than what can be  trivially deduced from the analysis of the program’s inputs and outputs. This  information is pertinent in the sense that it enables the attacker to bypass a  security function or represents itself as critical data of the protected program.  In a dual way, an obfuscator is defi ned in this model as a virtual black box’s  probabilistic generator, an ideal obfuscator ensuring that the protected program  analysis does not provide more information than the analysis of its input and  output distributions.  Another way to formalize an attacker is to defi ne the reverse engineering action  as an abstract interpretation of the concrete semantics of the protected program.  Such a defi nition is naturally suited to the static analysis of the program’s data  fl ow, which is a fi rst step before the application of optimization transformations.  In a dual way, an obfuscator is defi ned in the abstract interpretation model as  a specialized compiler, parameterized by some semantic properties that are  not preserved.  The goal of these modeling attempts is to get some objective criteria relative to  the effective robustness of obfuscation transformations. Indeed, many problems   c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 268      Chapter 5   Obfuscation   269  that were once thought to be diffi cult can be effi ciently attacked via judicious  application of code analysis techniques. Many methods that have arisen in the  context of more conventional topics in programming language theory  such as  compilers and formal verifi cation  can be repurposed for the sake of defeating  obfuscation.  This chapter begins with a survey of existing obfuscation techniques as  commonly found in real-world situations. It then covers the various available  methods and tools developed to analyze and possibly break obfuscation code.  Finally, it provides an example of a diffi cult, modern obfuscation scheme, and  details its circumvention using state-of-the-art analysis techniques.  A Survey of Obfuscation Techniques  For simplicity of presentation, we begin by dividing obfuscations into two  categories: data-based obfuscation and control-based obfuscation. You will  see later that the two combine in complex and diffi cult ways and are, in fact,  inseparable. Before wandering deeply down these paths, however, we begin  with a representative example of the types of code that one might encounter in  real-world obfuscation. Note that the example is particularly simple because it  involves only data-based obfuscations, not control-based ones.  The Nature of Obfuscation: A Motivating Example When targeting the x86 processor, compilers tend to generate instructions drawn  from a particular, tiny subset of the available instruction set, and the control  structure of the generated program follows predictable conventions. Over time,  the reverse engineer develops a style of analysis tailored to these patterns of  structured code. When confronted by nonconformant code, the speed of one’s  analysis can suffer tremendously.  This phenomenon can be illustrated simply by a concrete example. Because  one of the goals of a compiler optimizer is to reduce the amount of computa- tional resources involved in performing a task, and 50 years’ worth of research  have imbued them with formidable capabilities toward this pursuit, one does  not commonly spot obvious ineffi ciencies in the translation of the original  source code into assembly language. For example, if the source code were to  dictate that some variable be incremented by fi ve  e.g., due to a statement such  as x += 5; , a compiler would likely generate assembly code akin to one of  the following:  01: add eax, 5  02: add dword ptr [ebp-10h], 5  03: lea ebx, [ecx+5]  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 269   270   Chapter 5   Obfuscation  In obfuscated code, one might instead encounter code such as the following,  assuming that EAX corresponds to the variable x, and that the value of EBX is  free to be overwritten  or “clobbered” :  01: xor ebx, eax 02: xor eax, ebx 03: xor ebx, eax 04: inc eax 05: neg ebx 06: add ebx, 0A6098326h 07: cmp eax, esp 08: mov eax, 59F67CD5h 09: xor eax, 0FFFFFFFFh 10: sub ebx, eax 11: rcl eax, cl 12: push 0F9CBE47Ah 13: add dword ptr [esp], 6341B86h 14: sbb eax, ebp 15: sub dword [esp], ebx 16: pushf 17: pushad 18: pop eax 19: add esp, 20h 20: test ebx, eax 21: pop eax  You can see a variety of obfuscation techniques at work in this example:    Lines 1–3 use the “XOR swap trick” for exchanging the contents of two   locations—in this case, the EAX and EBX registers.     Line 4 shows an assignment to the EAX register that is actually “junk”  as   EAX is overwritten with a constant on line 8 .     On lines 5–6, the EBX register is negated and added to the constant   0A6098326h: EBX = - EAX + 0A6098326h.     On line 7, EAX is compared with ESP. The CMP instruction modifi es only  the fl ags, and the fl ags are overwritten on subsequent lines before being  used again, so this code is junk.     Lines 8–9 move the constant 59F67CD5h into the EAX register and XOR it with  -1h  which, in binary, is all one bits . XORing with all ones is equivalent  to the NOT operation; therefore, the effect of this sequence is to move the  constant 0A609832Ah into EAX.     Line 10 subtracts the constant in EAX from EBX: EBX = - EAX + 0A6098326h   - 0A609832Ah, or EBX = - EAX - 5, or EBX = -  EAX + 5 .     Line 11 modifi es EAX through use of the RCL instruction. This instruction   is junk because EAX is overwritten on line 18.  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 270      Chapter 5   Obfuscation   271     Lines 12–13 push the constant 0F9CBE47Ah and then add the constant   6341B86h to it, resulting in the value 0h on the bottom of the stack.     Line 14 modifi es EAX through use of the SBB instruction, involving the  extraneous register EBP. This instruction is junk, as EAX is overwritten on  line 18.     Line 15 subtracts EBX from the value currently on the bottom of the stack   which is 0h . Therefore, dword ptr [ESP] = 0 - -  EAX + 5 , or dword  ptr [ESP] = EAX + 5.     Lines 16–19 demonstrate operations involving the stack: nine dwords are  pushed, one is popped into EAX, and the stack pointer is then adjusted to  point to the same location that it pointed to before the sequence executed.    Line 20 tests EBX against the EAX register and sets the fl ags accordingly. If  the fl ags are redefi ned before their next use, then this instruction is dead.    Line 21 pops the value on the bottom of the stack  which holds EAX + 5    into the EAX register.  In summary, the code computes EAX = EAX + 5. Needless to say, the obfuscated code does not at all resemble the compiler- generated code, and one faces considerable diffi culty in ascertaining the function- ality of the snippet. Several obfuscation techniques are present in this example:     Pattern-based obfuscation    Constant unfolding    Junk code insertion     Stack-based obfuscation    The use of uncommon instructions, such as RCL, SBB, PUSHF, and PUSHAD  Correspondingly, a variety of existing compiler transformations can be used   to render the code into a form that is closer to the original:     Peephole optimization     Constant folding     Dead statement elimination     Stack optimization  The Interplay Between Data Flow and Control Flow  Consider the following instruction sequence:  01: mov eax, dword ptr [ebp-10h] 02: jmp eax  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 271   272   Chapter 5   Obfuscation  Suppose you wish to construct a “correct,” classical control-fl ow graph for a  program containing sequences like this one. In order to determine what the next  instruction will be after line 2 has executed—or, perhaps the set of potential  successor instructions—you need to determine the set of possible value s  for  the EAX register at that location. In other words, the control fl ow for this snip- pet is dependent upon the data fl ow as it pertains to the location [EBP-10h]  at the program point l1  line 1 . However, in order to determine the data fl ow  with respect to [EBP-10h], you need to determine the control fl ow with respect  to the line 1 location: You must know all possible control transfer instructions   and the associated data fl ow leading to those locations  that could possibly  target the line 1 location. It is not meaningful to talk about control fl ow without  simultaneously talking about data fl ow, or vice versa.  The situation is even more diffi cult than it might appear on the surface. Program  analysis tries to answer questions such as “What values might the location [EBP- 10h] assume under any possible circumstance?” To combat intractability and  undecidability, many forms of program analysis employ approximations of the  state space. Some approximations are fi ne  e.g., approximating the set {1,3} by  {1,2,3}  , and some are coarse  e.g., approximating that same set by {0,1,...,232 −1} .   Fine and coarse are not technical terms in this paragraph.  If you cannot fi nely  approximate the set of potential values of the [EBP-10h] location  for example,  if you must assume that the location could take on any possible value , then  you do not know where the jump will point, so you must assume that it could  target any location within the address space. Then, the data fl ow facts from the  line 2 location must be propagated into those at every other location. In practical  settings, such a decision will severely impact the analysis, most likely causing  it to conservatively conclude that all states are possible at all locations, which  is correct but useless.  Worse yet, if you ever must assume that a jump could target any location,  then due to variable-length instruction encoding on x86, many of these trans- fers will be into locations that do not correspond to the beginning of a proper  instruction. Such bogus instructions are likely to wreak havoc on any analysis,  especially when combined with the observations in the previous paragraph.  Academic work in this area, such as that by Kinder30 and Thakur et al.41, seeks  to construct systems that can return correct answers for all possible inputs. These  systems prefer to tell users that they cannot determine precise information,  return correct but grossly imprecise results, or die trying  e.g., by exhausting  all available memory or failing to terminate due to tractability issues , rather  than give an answer that is not fully justifi ed. This goal is laudable, given the  motivation from whence these disciplines were founded: to ensure absolute  correctness of programs and analyses. However, it is not in line with our moti- vations as obfuscation researchers.  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 272      Chapter 5   Obfuscation   273  Deobfuscation is a creature of a different sort than formal verifi cation or  program analysis, even if we prefer to use techniques developed in those con- texts. Whereas an obfuscator transforms a program Porig into a program Pobf, we  seek either a translator from Pobf into Porig or enough information about Pobf to  answer questions proximate to some reverse engineering effort. We hesitate to  use unsound methods, but we prefer actual results when the day is fi nished, so  we may employ such methods, albeit consciously and grudgingly.  Data-Based Obfuscations We begin by looking at obfuscation techniques that can be best described in  terms of their effect on data values and noncontrol computations. In particular,  assume that the presented snippets occur within a single basic block of the pro- gram’s control-fl ow graph. The discussions of control-based obfuscations, and  their combination with data-based obfuscations, are deferred to later sections.  Constant Unfolding  Constant folding is one of the earliest and most basic compiler optimizations. The  goal of this optimization is to replace computations whose results are known at  compile-time with those results. For example, in the C statement x = 4 * 5;,  the expression 4 * 5 consists of a binary arithmetic operator  *  that is supplied  with two operands whose values are statically known  4 and 5, respectively . It  would be wasteful for the compiler to generate code that computed this result  at run-time, as it can deduce what the result will be during compilation. The  compiler can simply replace the assignment with x = 20;.  Constant unfolding is an obfuscation that performs the inverse operation. Given  a constant value that is used somewhere in the input program, the obfuscator  can replace the constant by some computation process that produces the con- stant. You have already encountered this obfuscation in the motivating example:  01: push 0F9CBE47Ah 02: add dword ptr [esp], 6341B86h  Neglecting the modifi cations that this sequence has upon the fl ags, this was   found to be equivalent to push 0h.  Data-Encoding Schemes  The fundamental fl aw of this technique is that constants have to be dynamically  decoded  thus exposed, as well as the decode function  at run-time before being  processed. We have the encoding function f x  = x − 6341B86h, whose result f x  is  pushed on the stack, and then the decoded function is applied: f- 1  x = x + 6341B86h.   c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 273   274   Chapter 5   Obfuscation  This construct is trivial; deobfuscation is done by simply applying the standard  compiler’s constant folding optimization.  Efforts have been made to harden these statements and propose more resilient  encoding schemes. Some techniques, such as polynomial encoding and residue  encoding, have been described in patent US6594761 B1 by Chow, Johnson and  Gu11. Affi ne maps are also commonly used.  What if one could fi nd an encoding such that it is not mandatory to decode  variables to manipulate them  an equivalent operation can be defi ned on the  encoded variables ? This property, called homomorphism, has been discussed  in an obfuscation-oriented view, as well as a refi nement of the residue coding  technique in works such as those of Zhu and Thomborson.44  In abstract algebra, a homomorphism is an operation-preserving mapping between  two algebraic structures. Consider, for example, two groups, G and H, equipped  respectively with operations +g and +h. We want to construct a mapping  f   between  the sets underlying G and H, and we want your mapping to respect the opera- tions +g and +h. In particular, we must have that f  x+g y  = f x  +h f y .  The notion of a homomorphism can be generalized beyond groups to arbitrary  algebraic structures. For example, you can consider ring homomorphisms that  simultaneously preserve both the addition and the multiplication operators. In  contrast to mappings that preserve only one of the ring’s operations and not  the other, or induce restrictions upon the operators or their usage, unrestricted  mappings are considered fully homomorphic.  Fully homomorphic mappings have a natural application to obfuscation.  If the source algebra is the unencoded domain, and the target algebra is the  encoded one, then a homomorphic mapping enables us to perform computa- tions directly upon the encoded data without having to decode it beforehand  and re-encode it afterward.  At the time of writing, the topic of homomorphic cryptography is still in  its infancy. Fully homomorphic cryptosystems have been shown to exist, and  they enable the computation of encrypted programs upon encrypted data. That is  to say, rigorous statements can be made concerning the hardness of determin- ing specifi cs about the program being executed, and which data it is operating  upon. At present, the schemes are too ineffi cient for practical usage, and how to  best apply the technology to arbitrary computer programs is an open question.  Dead Code Insertion  Another common compiler optimization is known as dead code elimination, which  is responsible for removing program statements that do not have any effect on  the program’s operation. For example, consider the following C function:  int f   {   int x, y;   c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 274      Chapter 5   Obfuscation   275    x = 1;       this assignment to x is dead    y = 2;       y is not used again, so it is dead    x = 3;       x above here is not live    return x;    x is live }  Ultimately, the function returns the number 3. It does so after several mean- ingless computations that do not affect the function’s output. The fi rst assign- ments to x and y are said to be dead, as they have no effect on live computations. Obfuscators perform the inverse of this operation by inserting dead code for  the purpose of making the code harder to follow—the reverse engineer has to  manually decide whether a given instruction participates in the computation of  some meaningful result. The ability to insert “dead” code requires the obfuscator  to know which registers are “live” at every given program point; for example, if  EAX contains an important value  it’s live , and EBX does not  it’s dead , then you  can insert statements that modify EBX.  Deobfuscation of this construct is done by simply applying the standard  compiler’s dead statement elimination optimization, which can be done either  on a single basic block or across an entire control-fl ow graph.  Arithmetic Substitution via Identities  Mathematical statements can be made relating the results of certain operators  to the results of combinations of other operators. You have already seen an  instance of this general phenomenon in the motivating example, when you  encountered the instruction XOR EAX, 0FFFFFFFFh  where the binary representa- tion of 0FFFFFFFFh is all one bits . Because 0 XOR 1 = 1, and 1 XOR 1 = 0, this  instruction actually fl ips each of the bits in EAX; in other words, it is synonymous  with the NOT operator. Similarly, you can make the following statements:     -x = ~x + 1  by defi nition of two’s complement       rotate left x,y  =  x  >  bits x -y       rotate right x,y  =  x >> y    x <<  bits x -y       x-1 = ~-x     x+1 = - x  Pattern-Based Obfuscation  Pattern-based obfuscation, a staple of many contemporary protections, has a  simple underlying concept. The protection author manually constructs trans- formations that map one or more adjacent instructions into a more complicated  sequence of instructions that has the same semantic effect. For example, a pat- tern might convert the sequence  01: push reg32  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 275   276   Chapter 5   Obfuscation  into this sequence  which we will call 1 :  01: push imm32 02: mov dword ptr [esp], reg32  Or, it might convert that same sequence into this sequence  2 :  Patterns can be arbitrarily complicated. A more complex example might   01: lea esp, [esp-4] 02: mov dword ptr [esp], reg32   Or this one  3 :  01: sub esp, 4 02: mov dword ptr [esp], reg32  substitute the pattern:  01: sub esp, 4  for this pattern  4 :  01: push reg32 02: mov reg32, esp 03: xchg [esp], reg32 04: pop esp  Some protections have hundreds of patterns. Most protections apply patterns  randomly to the input sequence, such that two obfuscations of the same piece  of code result in a different output. Also, the patterns are applied iteratively.  Consider the following input:  01: push ecx  Imagine that it is transformed via substitution 3:  01: sub esp, 4 02: mov dword ptr [esp], ecx  Now suppose that the obfuscator is run a second time, and the fi rst instruc-  tion is replaced according to pattern 4:  01: push ebx 02: mov ebx, esp 03: xchg [esp], ebx 04: pop esp 05: mov dword ptr [esp], ecx  This process can be applied indefi nitely, resulting in an arbitrarily large  output sequence. With enough patterns, one can transform one instruction into  millions of instructions.  Note a few things about these substitutions. 1 and 2 preserve semantic  equivalence: After those sequences execute, the CPU will be in the same state   c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 276      Chapter 5   Obfuscation   277  that it would have been if the original one were executed instead. 3 does not  preserve semantic equivalence, because it uses the sub-instruction that changes  the fl ags, whereas the original push does not. As for sequence 4, the original  does change the fl ags, whereas the substitution does not; also, whereas the  original does not modify memory at all, the substitution writes the value of  ESP onto the bottom of the stack  hence, you could also consider this as being  equal to the PUSH ESP instruction .  These considerations illustrate the diffi culty of obfuscating assembly code  post-compilation. The protection is only safe to execute substitution 3 if it is  known that the fl ags modifi ed by the instruction are not used before the next  modifi cation to those fl ags. Substitution 4 is similarly safe if the fl ags are dead,  and if the resultant code is indifferent to the contents of [ESP] after the original  SUB ESP, 4 operation. Ensuring fl ag liveness requires building the function’s  control-fl ow graph, which can be diffi cult due to indirect branches. Ensuring  that the stack memory modifi cation is safe would be extremely diffi cult due to  memory aliasing. These specifi c concerns are unlikely to affect normal functions  generated by a compiler for which control-fl ow graphs can be generated, but it  is hoped that they illustrate the perils of applying semantically non-equivalent  transformations to compiled code.  Owing to the complexities of obfuscating compiled assembly language, pro- tections most commonly apply these transformations against the code cor- responding to the protection itself, rather than the target’s code. This way, the  protection authors can guarantee that the input code will be oblivious to those  transformations that do not preserve strict semantic equivalence.  Deobfuscation of this type of obfuscation is simple, although it can be time- consuming to write the deobfuscator. One can construct inverse pattern substitu- tions, which instead map the target sequences into the original ones. In fact, this  corresponds to a routine compiler optimization known as peephole optimization.  Academic works, such as that by Jacob et al.25 or Bansal,1 have discussed the  automated construction of both pattern-obfuscators and peephole optimizers. This brings us back to the question of practical results versus academic ones.  Suppose you are dealing with a pattern-based obfuscator that contains errors   e.g., erroneous pattern substitutions that do not preserve semantic equiva- lence . Suppose further that you, as a deobfuscation researcher, are aware of  the errors and are able to correct them at deobfuscation time. This means that  your deobfuscator will similarly not preserve semantic equivalence and is there- fore “incorrect” in absolute terms as far as transformation goes, but it actually  produces “correct” results with respect to the pre-obfuscated code. Should you  make the substitution? The formal correctness crowd would say no; we would  answer in the affi rmative.  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 277   278   Chapter 5   Obfuscation  Control-Based Obfuscation When reverse engineering compiler-generated code, reverse engineers are able to  rely on the predictability of the compiler’s translations of control fl ow constructs.  In doing so, they can quickly ascertain the control fl ow structure of the original  code at a level of abstraction higher than assembly language. Along the way,  the reverse engineer relies upon a host of assumptions about how compilers  generate code. In a pure compiled program, all code in a basic block will be most  often sequentially located  heavy compiler optimizations can possibly render  this basic premise null and void . Temporally related blocks usually will, too.  A CALL instruction always corresponds to the invocation of some function. The  RET instruction, too, will almost always signify the end of some function and its  return to its caller. Indirect jumps, such as for implementing switch statements,  appear infrequently and follow standard schemas.   Control-based obfuscation attacks these planks of standard reverse engineering,  in a way that complicates both static and dynamic analyses. Standard static analy- sis tools make similar assumptions as human reverse engineers, in particular:     The CALL instruction is only used to invoke functions, and a function   begins at the address targeted by a call.     Most calls return, and if they do, they return to the location immediately  following the CALL instruction; ret and RETN statements connote function  boundaries.     Upon encountering a conditional jump, disassemblers assume that it was   placed into the code “in good faith”—in particular that:    Both sides of the branch could feasibly be taken.    Code, not data, is located down each side of the branch.     They will be able to easily ascertain the targets of indirect jumps.    Indirect jumps and calls will only be generated for standard constructs   such as switches and function pointer invocations.     All control transfers target code locations, not data locations.    Exceptions will be used in predictable ways.  With respect to control transfers, disassemblers assume a model of “nor- mality” based around the patterns of standard compiled code. They explicitly  create functions at call targets, end them at return statements, continue disas- sembling after a call instruction, traverse both sides of all conditional branches,  assume all branch targets are code, use syntactic pattern-matching to resolve  indirect jump schema, and generally ignore exceptional control fl ow. Violating  the assumptions laid out previously leads to very poor disassembly. This is a   c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 278      Chapter 5   Obfuscation   279  consistent thorn in the side of obfuscation researchers, and an open research  topic  as discussed previously  in verifi cation.  Dynamic analysis has an easier time with respect to indirect control transfers,  since it can explicitly follow execution fl ow. However, the attacker still faces ques- tions involving determining the targets of indirect transfers, and suffers from  the lack of sequential locality induced by so-called spaghetti code. The following  sections elaborate upon what happens when these assumptions are challenged.  Functions In Out-Lining  The call graph of a program carries a lot of its high-level logic. Playing with the  notion of a function can break some of the reverser’s assumptions. It’s possible to:     Inline functions—The code of a subfunction is merged into the code of  its caller. Code size can grow quickly if the subfunction is called multiple  times.     Outline functions—A subpart of a function is extracted and transformed  into an independent function and replaced by a call to the newly created  functions.  Combining these two operations over a program leads to a degenerated call  graph with no apparent logic. It goes without saying that functions’ prototypes  can also be toyed with to reorder arguments, add extra, fake arguments, and so  on, to contribute to logic obscurity.  Destruction of Sequential and Temporal Locality  As stated, and as understood intrinsically by those who reverse engineer com- piled code, the instructions within a single, compiled basic block lie in one  straight-line sequence. This property is called sequential locality. Furthermore,  compiler optimizers attempt to put basic blocks that are related to one another   for example, a block and its successors  nearby, for the purpose of maximizing  instruction cache locality and reducing the number of branches in the compiled  output. We call this property the sequential locality of temporally related code. When  you reverse engineer compiled code, these properties customarily hold true. One  learns in analyzing such code that all of the code responsible for a single unit of  functionality will be neatly contained in a single region, and that the proximate  control-fl ow neighbors will be nearby and similarly sequentially located.  A very old technique in program obfuscation is to introduce unconditional  branches to destroy this aspect of familiarity that reverse engineers organically  obtain through typical endeavors. Here is a simple example:  01: instr_1: 02:   push offset caption 03:    jmp instr_4   c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 279   280   Chapter 5   Obfuscation  04: 05: instr_2: 06:    call MessageBoxA 07:    jmp instr_5  08: 09: instr_3: 10:    push 0  11:    jmp instr_2  12: 13: start: 14:    push 0  15:    jmp instr_1  16: 17: instr_4: 18:    push offset dlgtxt 19    jmp instr_3  20: 21: instr_5: 22: ; ...  This example shows the lack of sequential locality for instructions within a  basic block, and not temporal locality of multiple basic blocks. In practice, large  amounts of the program’s code will be intertwined in such a fashion  usually  with more than one instruction on a given basic block, unlike the preceding  example .  From a formal perspective, this technique does not even deserve to be called  “trivial,” as it has no semantic effect whatsoever on the program. Constructing  a control-fl ow graph and removing spurious unconditional branches will defeat  this scheme entirely. However, in terms of analysis performed manually by a  human, the ability to follow the code has been dramatically slowed.  Processor-Based Control Indirection  For most processors, two essential displacement primitives are the JMP-like  branch and the CALL-like save instruction pointer and branch. These primi- tives can be obfuscated by using dynamically computed branch addresses or  by emulating them. One of the most basic techniques is the couple PUSH-RET  used as a JMP instruction:  01: push target_addr 02: ret  01: jmp target_addr  That’s  almost  semantically equivalent to the following:  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 280      Chapter 5   Obfuscation   281  The CALL instruction is an easy target for obfuscators because most disas-  semblers assume the following about its high-level semantics:     The target address is a subfunction entry point.    A call returns  i.e., the instruction after the CALL is executed .  It is actually easy to break these assumptions. Consider the following example:  The CALL is used as a JMP; it will never return to line 2. The stack is fi xed  the  return address is discarded from the stack  on line 3. Next consider, these two  elements:  basic_block_b’s line 2 CALL instruction points to basic_block_a, which actu- ally is only a stub that updates  see basic_block_a’s line 2  the return address  stored onto the top of the stack before the RET instruction uses it  basic_block_a’s  line 3 . In these two examples the result is an interval between CALL’s natural   expected  and effective return addresses; an obfuscator can  and will  take  advantage to insert code that thwarts disassemblers and creates confusion.  The following example is an interesting enrichment of the standard PUSH-RET   01: call target_addr  02:    03: target_addr:  04: add esp, 4  01: basic_block_a: 02: add [esp], 9 03: ret  and  01: basic_block_b: 02: call basic_block_a 03:   04: true_return_addr: 05: nop  used as JMP previously:  01: push addr_branch_default 02: push ebx 03: push edx 04: mov ebx, [esp+8] 05: mov edx, addr_branch_jmp 06: cmovz ebx, edx 07: mov [esp+8], ebx 08: pop edx 09: pop ebx 10: ret  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 281   282   Chapter 5   Obfuscation  The basis of this construction actually is a PUSH-RET. Line 7 writes the target  address onto the stack; it is used by the RET at line 10. The pushed address comes  from EBX  line 7 , which is conditionally updated by the CMOVZX instruction at  line 6. If the condition is satisfi ed  the Z fl ag is tested , then the instruction acts  like a standard MOV  EBX is overwritten by EDX, which contains the branch target  address , otherwise it acts like a NOP  thus EBX contains the default branch address .  In the end, one can clearly see this pattern stands for a conditional jump  JZ .  Operating System–Based Control Indirection  The program can make use of operating system primitives  even though it may  imply a loss of portability . The Structured Exception Handler  SEH , Vectored  Exception Handler  VEH , and Unhandled Exception Handler, in Windows, and  signal handlers and setjmp longjmp functions, in Unix, are commonly used to  obfuscate the control fl ow.  The basic algorithm can be decomposed as follows:    1.  Obfuscated code triggers an exception  using invalid pointer, invalid   operation, invalid instruction, etc. .    2.  The operating system calls the registered exception handler s .   3.  The exception handler dispatches the instruction fl ow according to its   internal logic and sets back the program in a clean state.  The following example has been seen billions of times within x86 binaries:  01: push addr_seh_handler 02: push fs:[0] 03: mov fs:[0], esp 04: xor eax, eax 05: mov [eax], 1234h 06:   07: addr_seh_handler: 08:   09: pop fs:[0] 10: add esp, 4  Lines 1–3 set up the SEH. An exception is then triggered in the form of an  access violation as line 5 attempts to write at 0x0. Assuming the program is not  debugged, the operating system will transfer execution to the SEH handler. Please  also note that when a SEH handler is called, it receives a copy of the thread’s  context as one of its arguments, and the instruction pointer register value can  be modifi ed to further obfuscate the control fl ow redirection.   N O T E  This technique also eﬃ  ciently acts as an anti-debugger. Basically, the job of  a debugger is to handle exceptions. These exceptions have to be passed to the debug  target; otherwise, the target’s behavior will be modiﬁ ed and tampering detected.  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 282      Chapter 5   Obfuscation   283  More interesting, the concept can also be reversed. What if a protection inserts  exceptions in the original program and catches them with its own attached debug- ger? The protected program consists of a debuggee and debugger. A well-known  example of this is the namomites feature from Armadillo. Namomites actually  replace  conditional  jumps by INT 3 instruction. The exception is caught by the  protection’s debugger, which updates the debuggee’s context appropriately to  emulate the  conditional  jumps. One cannot simply detach the debugger from  the debuggee; otherwise, exceptions would not be handled and the program  would crash. An implementation of this concept has been proposed by Deroko.19  Opaque Predicates  An opaque predicate  introduced by Collberg in “A Taxonomy of Obfuscating  Transformations”12 and “Manufacturing Cheap, Resilient, and Stealthy Opaque  Constructs”13  is a special conditional construct  Boolean expression  that always  evaluates to either true or false  respectively noted PT and PF . Its value is known  only at compilation obfuscation time and should be unknown to an attacker as  well as computationally hard to prove, to meet a suffi cient degree of resilience.  Used in combination with a conditional jump instruction, it introduces an  additional, spurious branch—i.e., an additional edge in the control-fl ow graph   CFG . This dead branch can be used to insert junk code or special properties  like cycles in the CFG to harden the analysis. However, the spurious branch has  to look real enough to escape simple detection by a human attacker  for example,  only one of the two branches contains necessary variable initializations .  It has the appearance of a conditional jump but its semantics are that of an  unconditional jump. Computationally complex mathematical problems can be  used to implement opaque predicates. You can also use some environmental  variables whose values are constant and known at compilation obfuscation  time. This last technique may be less resilient because there is a limited, fi nite  set of candidate variables, thus limiting the potential diversity.  Designing resilient opaque predicates is a tough job. They are superfl uous  pieces of code mixed with existing code that has its own logic style; if no special  care is taken they are easily detectable. A good practice is to create dependen- cies between the predicate and the program’s state variables. A human attacker   you  is usually quite effi cient at detecting dubious patterns. Using an absurdly  complex predicate may effectively thwart a static analysis tool but it will prob- ably be easily detected by a human attacker.  An interesting variation on the original concept uses a predicate that ran- domly returns either true or false  noted P? . As both branches are potentially  executed at run-time, they have to be semantically equivalent. In most cases  that amounts to cloning  and possibly diversifying  a basic block  or a larger  piece of code , producing a “diamond-like” construct.  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 283   284   Chapter 5   Obfuscation  Simultaneous Control-Flow and Data-Flow Obfuscation For the sake of clarity, we have dissociated control-fl ow and data-fl ow obfusca- tion so far. In practice, however, both are intimately linked. This section presents  techniques based on this interplay.  Inserting Junk Code  This technique is intimately tied to control fl ow obfuscation. It basically consists  of inserting a dead  that is, never executed  code block between two valid code  blocks. The objective is to totally thwart a disassembler that has already been  tricked into following an invalid path  typically a case of opaque predicates .  Instructions contained within the junk code may be partially invalid, or may  create branches to invalid addresses  such as in the middle of valid instructions   to over-complicate the CFG.  The most trivial example of junk code insertion could be as follows:  Here is something a bit more elaborate, using a dummy opaque predicate:  01: jmp label 02:    03: label: 04:    01: push eax 02: xor eax, eax 03: jz 9 04:   05: jg 4 06: inc esp 07: ret 08:   09: pop eax  The conditional jump at  address  line 3 is always true because the EAX reg- ister is zeroed by the XOR instruction at line 1. That means you have six bytes  of junk code. This junk block uses instructions that will infl uence the disas- sembler, creating a new branch and seemingly inserting a function end  the  RET instruction at line 9 .  When generated appropriately, junk code blocks may be quite diffi cult to spot  at fi rst sight. Most often they will be removed from the disassembler’s reach as  a side effect of control fl ow deobfuscation  see http:  www.openrce.org blog  view 1672 Control_Flow_Deobfuscation_ via_Abstract_Interpretation . In  the last example, if the opaque predicate is detected as such, then no more paths  lead to the junk code block. Like all the other techniques, if it is not differenti- ated suffi ciently—for example, using a limited database of static patterns—its  resilience and strength tend to be minimal.  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 284      Chapter 5   Obfuscation   285  Control-Flow Graph Flattening  The basic idea behind graph fl attening is to replace all control structures with a  unique switch statement, known as the dispatcher. A subgraph of the program’s  control-fl ow graph is selected  implementations often work at the level of func- tions  and transformed, at which time basic blocks may be reworked  split or  merged . Each basic block is then responsible for updating the dispatcher’s  context  i.e., the subprogram’s state  so that the dispatcher can link to the next  basic block  see Figure 5-1 . Relationships between basic blocks are now “hidden”  within the dispatcher context’s manipulation operations. Conditional jumps  as  in block d  can easily be emulated using fl ags testing and IMUL instructions, or  simple CMOV instructions.  a  h  d  g  b  c  Figure 5-1  dispatcher  a  h  e  f  b  c  d  e  f  g  It goes without saying that a large part of this technique’s resilience against  static analysis rests on the ability to obfuscate the context’s manipulations and  transitions. Various features can be implemented to harden the problem, such  as inter-procedural relationships, pointer aliasing, inserting dummy states,  and so on.  In the same fashion as opaque predicates, CFG fl attening can also be used  to insert dead code paths and spurious basic blocks. A lot can be said about  graph fl attening and how to harden an implementation. The resulting graph  offers no clues about the structure of the algorithm, and dispatch and context  manipulation code also add an overhead that contributes to hiding the protected  code. This technique is conceptually the same as code virtualization  virtual   c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 285   286   Chapter 5   Obfuscation  machine ; it can be seen as partial virtualization that targets  virtualizes  only  the control fl ow  not the data fl ow .  Should you want to see fl attened code yourself, just grab a copy of a Flash  plugin  such as NPSWF32.dll , disassemble the fi le, and look for functions with  the biggest size. Flattened functions are easily recognizable.  Virtual Machines  Virtual machines  VMs  are a potent class of software protection and an espe- cially complex transformation. A VM basically consists of an interpreter and  some bytecode. The language supported by the interpreter is at the discretion  of the protection. At compile-time, selected parts of code are compiled with  respect to the VM’s target architecture  they are retargeted  and then inserted  into the protected program alongside the associated interpreter. At run-time,  the interpreter assumes the bytecode execution  i.e., the translation from target  architecture to original architecture . VMs usually come with sizeable overhead  in terms of performance  particularly CPU time , which is why typically only  specifi c, selected parts of the original program are virtualized.  Examples of well-known, VM-centered protections include VMProtect and  CodeVirtualizer. We will later delve into the delightful activity of VM analysis.  For now, suffi ce it to say that an attacker has to understand the interpreter in  order to analyze the bytecode and eventually to create a compiler from target  architecture to native architecture  unvirtualization .  White Box Cryptography  When the application to be protected cannot base its security on the use of a  hardware component, or on a network server, you must hypothesize an attacker  able to execute the application in an environment that he or she perfectly con- trols. The attacker model matching this situation, called the white-box attack  context  WBAC , imposes a particular software implementation of classical  cryptographic primitives.  Such mechanisms are tailor-made to ensure confi dentiality of a secret key  within an algorithm. Such a transformation  hiding a key in an encryption  algorithm, with or without the help of environment interaction  can be formal- ized as an obfuscation transformation.   This section describes some negative and positive results concerning code   obfuscation, and their impact on this key management problem.   A probabilistic algorithm O is an obfuscator if it satisfi es the following prop-  erties, given by Barak et al.2:     P and O P  compute the same function.    The growth of execution time and space of O P  is at most polynomial in   regard to execution time and space of program P.  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 286      Chapter 5   Obfuscation   287     For any polynomial time probabilistic algorithm A, there exists a polynomial  time probabilistic algorithm S and a negligible function m  a negligible  function is a function that grows much slower than the inverse of any  polynomial , such as the following: for all programs P,   p[A O P  =1] - p[SP 1P =1]  ≤ m P   The virtual black box property expresses the fact that the outputs distribution of  any probabilistic analysis algorithm A applied to the obfuscated program O P   is almost everywhere equal to the outputs distribution of a simulator S making  oracle access to program P.  Program S does not have access to the description  of program P, but for any entry x, it is given access to P x  in polynomial time in  regard to the size of P. An oracle access to program P is equivalent to an access  to sole inputs outputs of the program P.   Intuitively, the virtual black box property simply stipulates that everything  that can be calculated from the obfuscated version O P  can also be calculated  via oracle access to P.   One of the main points about such an ideal obfuscator is that it does not exist.  The proof is based on the construction of a program that cannot be obfuscated.  This impossibility result demonstrates that a virtual black box generator—which  could protect the code of any program by preventing it from revealing more  information than is revealed by its inputs outputs—does not exist. This impos- sibility result naturally leads to important outcomes for designers of obfuscation  mechanisms  adapted to WBAC context .  Consider a practical application of obfuscation that consists of transforming  a symmetric encryption into an asymmetric encryption, by obfuscating the pri- vate key encryption scheme. An unobfuscatable private key encryption scheme  does exist if a private key encryption scheme exists. This clearly indicates that  private key encryption schemes are not all well suited for obfuscation.  Note that this result does not prove that there is not some private key encryption  scheme such that we can give to the attacker a circuit calculating the encryption  algorithm without security loss. It does prove, however, that there is no general  method enabling the transformation of any private key encryption scheme into  a public key encryption system by obfuscating the encryption algorithm.   The problem of constructing a private key encryption scheme verifying the  virtual black box property  thus resilient in the WBAC context  remains of inter- est for cryptography researchers, even if the impossibility result concerning  a generic way to manage it may seem discouraging. White box DES and AES  implementations proposals illustrate this interest.   Obfuscation by using a network of encoded lookup tables makes it possible  to obtain from DES and AES algorithm versions that are more resilient in the  white box attack context. However, effective cryptanalysis of DES  such as the  one done by Goubin24  and AES  by Billet5  white box implementations has   c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 287   288   Chapter 5   Obfuscation  established that the problem of constructing a private key encryption scheme  verifying the virtual black box property remains unsolved.  The ideal model of an obfuscator able to transform any program into a virtual  black box cannot be implemented. In particular, there is no general transforma- tion that enables, starting from an encryption algorithm and a key, obtaining an  obfuscated version of this algorithm that could be published without leaking  information about the key it contains.  However, this formalism does not establish that it is impossible to hide a key  in an algorithm in order to transform a private key algorithm into public key  encryption.   A method has been published  by Chow9  to make the extraction of the key  diffi cult in the white box context. The principle is to implement a specialized  version of the DES algorithm that embeds the key K, and which is able to do only  one of the two operations, encrypt or decrypt. This implementation is resilient  in a white box context because it is diffi cult to extract the key K by observing  the operations carried out by the program and because it is diffi cult to forge  the decryption function starting from the implementation of the encryption  function, and inversely.  The main idea is to express the algorithm as a sequence  or a network  of  lookup tables, and to obfuscate these tables by encoding their input output. All  the operations of the block cipher, such as the addition modulo 2 of the round  key, are embedded in these lookup tables. These tables are randomized, in order  to obfuscate their functioning.  Obfuscation of AES  described by Chow10  is done in a similar way as DES.  The goal is still to embed the round keys in algorithm code, in order to avoid  storing the key in static memory or loading it in dynamic memory at the time  of execution. The technique used to securely embed these keys is  as for DES  to  represent AES as a network of lookup tables, and to apply input output encod- ings in order to hide the keys.  Achieving Security by Obscurity So far, you have seen a great number of obfuscation techniques. Most of them  are simple transformations that seem quite weak at fi rst sight—and they are  actually weak considered individually. How one can build security or trust from  such primitives? The strength of an obfuscation system  or obfuscator  comes  from the iterative and combined applications of a set of these techniques. Each  successive application of a simple technique accrues into a strong indiscernible  global transformation  well, at least that is the objective . An interesting analogy  has been proposed by Jakubowski et al.26 between round-based cryptography  and iterated obfuscation. A cryptographic algorithm’s round is made of basic  arithmetic operations  addition, exclusive or, etc.  that perform trivial transfor- mations on the inputs. Considered individually, a round is weak and prone to   c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 288      Chapter 5   Obfuscation   289  multiple forms of attacks. Nevertheless, applying a set of rounds multiple times  can result in a somewhat secure algorithm. That is the objective of an obfuscator.  The objective of the attacker is to discern the rounds from the global obfuscated  form and to attack them at their weakest points.  Keep in mind that even if the obfuscator is not perfect, as soon as it raises the  bar required to break into the protected code by a suffi cient amount, this may be  suffi cient for the defender. For example, if a few weeks or months are required  to break into a new version of software, the defender can take advantage of  that period to work on new protections, protocol updates, and so on, and thus  always be ahead of the game.  A Survey of Deobfuscation Techniques   Now that you have a better understanding of code obfuscation, the question  is how can you, as a reverse engineer, take up the challenge? What means and  tools are at your disposal to break into obfuscated code? Manual analysis of  obfuscated code is a tedious, if not impossible, task; you’ll want to boil down  the problem to clean code analysis.  Because a manual approach using standard program analysis tools is fas- tidious, and considering the wide variety of obfuscation mechanisms that an  analyst may face, it is necessary to fi nd some models and criteria to design and  evaluate deobfuscation algorithms. This section provides a brief overview of the  problem from a more theoretical perspective, and describes some well-studied  formal methods that can be used to design more generic deobfuscation tools  and automate as much as possible the tasks undertaken by an analyst.  The Nature of Deobfuscation: Transformation Inversion In order to undo obfuscation transformation, several software analysis tech- niques are available. This section covers the following:     The notion of decidable approximation    Some methods, either static or dynamic, that can be used, and advantages  that can be gained from hybrid static dynamic methods  some of them  are presented later through the use of specialized tools       Some criteria that can always been applied to evaluate an analysis algo- rithm and from which it is possible to derive some security criteria about  obfuscation robustness  and in a dual way a deobfuscation transforma- tion effi ciency      Open problems and new trends concerning hybrid dynamic static analysis   and formalization of deobfuscation  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 289   290   Chapter 5   Obfuscation  The subject is vast, and there is still no consensus about the terminology  for the various specialized areas of research in the literature. The goal of this  section is thus to provide readers with some keywords to enable a global view,  and some useful references for interested readers who want to supplement their  knowledge in this domain.  You can observe several dichotomies in the fi eld of software analysis. Some  analysis techniques are described as static or dynamic, even if this distinction some- times seems quite artifi cial.  This distinction is discussed by Yannis Smaragdakis  and Christoph Csallner38.  Otherwise, analysis algorithms are qualifi ed as sound  or complete, but these important characteristics may have different meanings in  the literature. Finally, program analyses are described as over-approximation or  under-approximation, but this distinction also seems somewhat artifi cial because  some analysis methods appear to use both over- and under-approximation.  The remainder of this section discusses both the “synergy” and “duality” of  static and dynamic analysis  also discussed by Michael D. Ernst20 , fi rst intro- ducing the formal model of abstract interpretation and then providing several  analysis examples in relation to deobfuscation.  Finding a Decidable Approximation of the Concrete Semantics  The purpose of any program analysis is to check whether the program satisfi es  a certain property. Unfortunately, the question is generally undecidable for any  non-trivial property—that is to say, you cannot design an algorithm to determine  whether the property holds for the program. To overcome this diffi culty, one  solution is to abstract the concrete behaviors of the program into a decidable  approximation. The purpose of abstract interpretation is to formalize this idea  of approximation in a unifi ed framework.  Readers can refer to the paper by  Patrick Cousot and Radia Cousot.14    The semantics of a program represent all of its possible concrete behavior,  including its interaction with any possible computer system environment.  Among the most precise  concrete  semantics are the so-called trace semantics.  This semantics includes all fi nite and infi nite sequences of states and transi- tions. Where X is the set of execution traces  fi nite and infi nite , you can express  the trace semantics as the least solution  for the computational partial ordering   of a fi xpoint equation X=F X .   An abstract domain is an abstraction of a concrete semantics. The goal of abstract  interpretation is to provide computable, fi xpoint approximations of abstract  domains, thus defi ning computable abstract semantics. Obviously, the coarser  the abstract semantics, the fewer questions it can answer.   All abstractions of a semantics can be organized in a hierarchy  described by  Cousot16 , from the most precise to the coarsest. More precisely, abstract seman- tics can be placed on a lattice, and the approximation partial ordering of this lattice   c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 290      Chapter 5   Obfuscation   291  can be used to characterize the concreteness  or precision  of abstract semantics,  and thus the sets of questions they are able to answer.   Abstract interpretation generally applies to static analysis, through an over- approximation of the concrete semantics. You might notice that, in a dual way  and according to the “dual principle” of lattice theory, it should also apply to  dynamic analysis, even if there are not currently many works on this subject.  You will see in the next section that relations and synergy between static and  dynamic analysis lead to practical hybrid dynamic static methods, making  it possible both for a dynamic approach to gain in coverage and for a static  approach to gain in precision.  Dynamic and Static Analyses Form a Continuum  Static analysis is the discipline of automatically inferring information about com- puter programs without running them  it thus applies to a “static” representation  of the program . Static analysis tries to derive properties  invariants  that hold  for all executions of the program, through a conservative over-approximation  of its concrete semantics.  An example of such static analysis is the constant propagation algorithm, which  aims to determine for each program instruction whether a variable has a constant  value whenever the control fl ow reaches that instruction. Information about  constants is useful in the context of program compilation, optimization, and  recompilation. It is used, for example, for dead code and dead execution path  deletion  by replacing all uses of constant variables by their constant values, you  may be able to identify constant conditional branches, which are conditioned  by constant predicates .  Among the many optimization techniques, partial evaluation techniques   described by Beckman et al.3  must be kept in mind in the context of reverse  engineering. A partial evaluator specializes a program with regard to part of its  input data. You expect the program’s concrete semantics to be preserved by the  specialization process and the resulting program’s syntactic representation to  be optimized for the class of inputs used, and as a result simpler to understand. Another important class of optimization techniques includes slicing tech- niques  described by Weiser42 , which also aim to simplify the program under  consideration, but in this case by deleting those parts of the program that are  irrelevant according to a criterion provided by the analyst. A static slicing crite- rion includes a set of variables and a chosen point of interest. A dynamic slicing  criterion completes a static criterion with the information corresponding to some  concrete execution. Slicing is of great interest in the reverse engineering context,  because it is representative of the way a reverser mentally slices a program when  attempting to understand its inner working.   c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 291   292   Chapter 5   Obfuscation  In contrast to static analysis, dynamic analysis is the discipline of automatically  inferring information about a running computer program. Dynamic analysis  derives properties that hold for one or more executions of a program, through  a precise under-approximation.   A common method of dynamic analysis is dynamic testing, which executes a  program with several inputs and checks the program’s response. Generally, test  cases explore only a subset of the possible executions of the program.   In order to enlarge the coverage of dynamic testing, the principle of sym- bolic execution  described by Boyer6  uses symbolic values rather than concrete  inputs. At any point during symbolic execution, a symbolic state of the program  is updated. This symbolic state consists of a symbolic store and a path constraint.  The symbolic store contains the symbolic values, and the path constraint is  a formula that records the history of all conditional branches taken until the  current instruction.  At a given instruction of the program, you can use a constraint solver  SMT or  SAT solver  to determine the corresponding path constraint. A satisfying assign- ment provides concrete inputs with which the program reaches the program  instruction. By generating new tests and exploring new paths, you can increase  the coverage of dynamic testing.   Unfortunately, constraints generated during symbolic execution may be too  complex for the constraint solver. If the constraint solver is unable to compute a  satisfying assignment, you cannot determine whether a path is feasible or not.  Concolic execution  described by Godefroid23 and Sen37  provides a solution to  this problem in many situations. The idea is to perform both symbolic execution  and concrete execution of a program. When the path constraint is too complex  for the constraint solver, you can use the concrete information to simplify the  constraint  typically by replacing some of the symbolic values with concrete  values . You can then expect to fi nd a satisfying assignment of this simplifi ed  constraint.  Because symbolic execution is unable to handle an unbounded loop, which  results in infi nite symbolic execution paths, it must under-approximate the  concrete semantics of the program. You can perform this simplifi cation by fi x- ing some arbitrary loop limit. Another solution is to use symbolic execution in  conjunction with a static analysis inferring loop invariants.  It appears that dynamic and static analysis approaches form a continuum. As  an illustration, dynamic testing, symbolic execution, and abstract interpretation  are three ways of approximating the concrete semantics of a program. Dynamic  analysis uses concrete values and explores a subset of concrete transitions.  Symbolic execution clearly lies between dynamic testing and static analysis.  It rests on a more abstract semantics, but also an under-approximation. An  abstract interpreter over-approximates the concrete semantics of the program.   c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 292      Chapter 5   Obfuscation   293  However, the borderline between those analysis approaches is not so easy  to defi ne. For example, symbolic execution can be defi ned as a logical abstract  interpreter, operating over the abstract domain of logical formulas.   In conclusion, many static analysis methods are improved by the use of a  dynamic analysis–based refi nement. Conversely, the coverage of many dynamic  analysis methods can be increased by using traditional static analysis methods.  Thus, the investigation of hybrid dynamic static approaches is of great interest,  especially in the context of reverse engineering. The soundness and complete- ness criteria can be used to capture this synergy.   Soundness and Completeness  You can formulate any program analysis problem as verifi cation that the pro- gram satisfi es a property. Two fundamental concepts can be used to character- ize an analysis algorithm: its soundness and its completeness. These concepts,  traditionally applied to logical systems, can also be applied to program analysis.  Unfortunately, because of their dual natures  soundness and completeness cor- respond to converse implications in logic , there is still no consensus regarding  their application to the various specialized areas of research in the literature.  Given a property, a sound program analysis identifi es all violations of the  property. However, because it over-approximates the behaviors of the program,  it may also report violations of the property that cannot occur. For example, a  sound error detection algorithm detects every possible error, though some of  them may not occur at run-time.  A sound partial evaluation algorithm preserves the original program’s con- crete semantics, in the sense that the specialized program does not produce  any output value that is not produced by the original program  even if it may  not be able to produce all of them .  A sound symbolic execution guarantees that because a symbolic constraint  path is satisfi able, there must be a concrete execution path that reaches the cor- responding concrete state  even if some reachable concrete state does not have  a corresponding symbolic state .  A sound abstract interpreter preserves the program’s concrete semantics. If it  claims that an optimization transformation is possible for a program, then the  optimization can be applied without breaking the program semantics. Observe,  however, that it may be unable to answer the question for some optimizations.  It can claim that an optimization is unsafe even if it is in fact possible to apply  the transformation  without any destructive effect . Some potential optimiza- tions will not be applied. The soundness of the abstract interpreter is relative to  which questions it can answer correctly, despite the loss of information. In that  sense, it is conservative. Technically, the least fi xpoints computed by an abstract  interpreter represent at least all occurring run-time concrete states.  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 293   294   Chapter 5   Obfuscation  For example, a constant propagation algorithm is sound when any constant  it detects is indeed a constant. However, some constants may be not detected.  Given a property, a complete analysis algorithm reports a violation of the prop- erty only if there is a concrete violation of the property. However, because it  under-approximates the behaviors of the program, some concrete violations of  the property may not be reported.  A complete partial evaluation algorithm results in the generation of a spe- cialized program that is able to produce the same output values as the original  program for the intended input values. If unsound, it may produce unexpected  output values  i.e., not produced by the original program .  A complete symbolic execution covers all concrete transitions. It guarantees  that if a concrete execution state is reachable, then there must be a corresponding  symbolic state. Because symbolic execution is unable to handle an unbounded  loop, which results in infi nite symbolic execution paths, it must under-approximate  the concrete semantics of the program  typically by providing some loop limit .  Therefore, symbolic execution algorithms are most often incomplete.  A complete abstract interpreter is the most precise for answering a given set  of questions. Technically, this means that every state represented by the least  fi xpoint is reachable for some concrete input. For example, a complete constant  propagation algorithm would be able to detect every constant in a program.  We have presented some criteria  soundness and completeness  that can  always be applied to evaluate an analysis algorithm. It is possible to derive from  them some security criteria about obfuscation robustness  and, in a dual way,  deobfuscation transformation effi ciency .  Abstract interpretation can be used for modeling any program transformation   refer to the paper by Patrick and Radia Cousot15 . By considering the syntax  of a program as an abstraction of its concrete semantics, we can formalize any  syntactic program transformation as an abstract interpretation of the corre- sponding semantic transformation.   A particular application of this concerns obfuscation and deobfuscation trans- formations modeling. Mila Dalla Preda and Roberto Giacobazzi18 investigate  the semantic transformations corresponding to opaque predicate insertion.  By modeling deobfuscation as an abstraction interpretation, they observe that  breaking opaque predicates corresponds to having complete abstraction. The  completeness criterion turns out to be of special interest in terms of qualifying  both deobfuscator effectiveness and opaque predicate robustness.  In conclusion, many methods already used in program analysis and compila- tion are of interest in the context of reverse engineering. As demonstrated earlier,  the frontier between static and dynamic analysis is not so obvious. Currently,  the abstract interpretation model seems to be suffi ciently general to apply to  both types of analyses. The soundness and completeness criteria are of special  interest when modeling obfuscation and deobfuscation transformations in the   c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 294      Chapter 5   Obfuscation   295  abstract interpretation framework. You have seen that both the soundness and  the completeness of an algorithm can be defi ned for static and dynamic analy- ses  data fl ow analyses, partial evaluation, slicing, symbolic execution , which  are good candidates to represent the actions conducted by reversers when they  try to simplify the representation of an obfuscated program. Using the abstract  interpretation model, static and dynamic analyses appear to be dual in nature.  This duality and the gain that can be obtained from a synergy between static  and dynamic methods lead to new possibilities that must be investigated in the  future, through the study of hybrid methods.   This section presented some academic models and criteria, as well as dynamic  and static analysis methods, that can be useful for designing and evaluating  deobfuscation algorithms. It also stressed the importance of hybrid methods.  The next section presents some of the tools currently available to assist in undo- ing obfuscation transformations.  Deobfuscation Tools In this section we discuss some of the tools that you can use to reverse engineer  obfuscated code and especially the features they offer to ease your job. Please  note that this list is not meant to be exhaustive in any way; it is based on the  experience of some of the authors and seeks to present different categories of tools.  IDA  IDA is the state-of-the-art tool for reverse engineering binary code. Throwing  the binary one wants to analyze into IDA is a common refl ex, so there’s prob- ably no need to introduce this tool here; otherwise, readers can refer to the The  IDA Pro Book by Chris Eagle  No Starch Press, 2011 . Regarding the specifi c topic  that interests us here, dealing with obfuscated code using IDA is problematic   although not impossible  for a few reasons:     That’s not the purpose for which IDA is primarily intended. Obfuscated  code is a very particular case, and handling every specifi c situation trick  would be an endless job; thus it’s better not to start on this path.     We have very little control over the disassembler, a point that greatly  impedes us when encountering obfuscation schemes that break disrupt  destroy the control-fl ow graph. IDA’s disassembler is really easy to confuse  and one often ends up with the chicken-and-egg problem: To recover the  control fl ow one needs to clean the data fl ow, but to clean the data fl ow  one needs the control fl ow.     IDA itself doesn’t offer any sort of intermediate representation  IR  or at  least instruction semantics, so advanced analysis of its output is not trivial.  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 295   296   Chapter 5   Obfuscation  In 2008 at the ICAR workshop  http:  www.hex-rays.com  products ida  support ppt caro_obfuscation.ppt , Ilfak Guilfanov offered some useful tips  on how to use specifi c features of IDA:     Graph-level block merging to simplify the CFG    Event-driven, on-the-fl y modifi cation of the graph using hooks like grcode_  changed_graph  see graph.hpp in the SDK      Develop specifi c plugins  IDA can be extended using scripts  either IDC or IDAPython  or plugins  see  IDA’s SDK . If you were to implement some advanced analysis, that’s where you  would be able to interact.  To that end, some plugins have been developed as deobfuscation frame- works  for example, Branko Spasojevic’s Optimice plugin, http:  optimice. googlecode.com . Trying to address some of the issues previously mentioned,  including instruction semantics—based on the x86 Opcode and Instruction  Reference  http:  ref.x86asm.net  —the plugin offers CFG reduction, peep- hole optimizations, and dead code removal.  Metasm  Metasm  http:  metasm.cr0.org  is open source framework  released under  the GNU Lesser GPL v2  developed by Yoann Guillot. It defi nes itself as an  assembly manipulation suite. The framework, written in Ruby, actually offers  cross-architecture assembler, disassembler, compiler, linker, and debugger fea- tures. Currently supported processors are Intel x86 x64, MIPS, PPC, Sh4, and  ARCompact. Most common fi le formats are supported as well, such as MZ, PE  COFF, ELF, Mach-O, and so on.  Disassembler Callbacks The behavior of the disassemblery can be dynamically modifi ed using a set of  exported callbacks of the Disassembler class. The two most useful for deob- fuscation are as follows:     callback_newaddr—This is called each time a path is discovered and is  about to be disassembled. At this point you can inspect the path back- ward or forward for unseemliness; most important, you can modify the  behavior of the disassembly engine—removing a spurious control transfer,  thwarting a disassembler trap, etc.     callback_newinstr—As its name suggests, your callback is called each   time a new instruction is disassembled.  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 296      Chapter 5   Obfuscation   297  Instruction Semantics One of the framework’s key features is backtracking  think of it as program  slicing . This feature is at the heart of its disassembly engine. It enables very  precise control fl ow recovery, at the cost of performance. Built on top of this  feature, the framework’s API also offers a method to compute the semantics  of a basic block. Metasm does not use a strict intermediate language, however;  it relies on a description of the semantics of each instruction. The associated  terminology in the framework is binding. Metasm separates control fl ow and  data fl ow semantics encoding. Four types are used to describe the semantics  of an instruction:     Numerical value    Symbol—Whatever is not a numerical value, based on Ruby’s symbol type    Expression: Expression[operand1,  operator ,  operand2 ]—An   operand can be any of the four types.     Indirection—Memory indirection Indirection[target, size, origin]  The following snippet will introduce you to the Metasm instructions’ binding:   encoding: ASCII-8BIT ! usr bin env ruby require "metasm"  include Metasm   produce x86 code  sc = Metasm::Shellcode.assemble Metasm::Ia32.new, <<EOS   add eax, 0x1234 mov [eax], 0x1234 ret  EOS   dasm = sc.init_disassembler   disassemble handler code  dasm.disassemble 0    get decoded instruction at address 0  then its basic block  bb = dasm.di_at 0 .block   display disassembled code puts "\n[+] generated code:" puts bb.list   run though the basic block's list of decoded instruction  bb.list.each{di      puts "\n[+] {di.instruction}"      sem = di.backtrace_binding    c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 297   298   Chapter 5   Obfuscation      puts " data flow:"      sem.each{key, value puts   * {key} => {value}"}       does instruction modify the instruction pointer ?     if di.opcode.props[:setip]          puts " control flow:"          then display control flow semantics          puts "  * {dasm.get_xrefs_x di }"      end }  For each DecodedInstruction, you call the backtrace_binding method.  It returns a hash. Each key value pair represents an assignment of the key  according to the value and expresses outputs with respect to inputs. Running  the scripts produces the following result:   [+] generated code: 0 add eax, 1234h 5 mov dword ptr [eax], 1234h 0bh ret ; endsub entrypoint_0  [+] add eax, 1234h    data flow:     * eax => eax+1234h     * eflag_z =>   eax+1234h &0ffffffffh ==0     * eflag_s =>    eax+1234h >>1fh &1 !=0     * eflag_c =>   eax&0ffffffffh +1234h >0ffffffffh     * eflag_o =>    eax>>1fh &1 ==0 &&    eax>>1fh &1 !=0 !=                      eax+1234h >>1fh &1 !=0    [+] mov dword ptr [eax], 1234h    data flow:     * dword ptr [eax] => 4660  [+] ret    data flow:     * esp => esp+4+0   control flow:     * [Indirection[Expression[:esp], 4, 0xb]]  The RET instruction is quite representative of the distinction between data  fl ow and control fl ow. The get_xrefs_x method provided by the disassembler  object returns a list  a Ruby Array object  of possible values for the instruction  pointer. For that specifi c instruction, it is an indirection whose target is the ESP  register and whose size is 4  for the Ia32 architecture —i.e., dword ptr [ESP];  0xb is the address in the program where the indirection occurs.  Backtracking and Slicing So far, you have seen how the semantics are described for each isolated instruc- tion. Now consider instructions within a control fl ow and how an instruction’s   c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 298      Chapter 5   Obfuscation   299  binding can be used. For this purpose, the following example demonstrates a  typical dynamic jump computation pattern:   encoding: ASCII-8BIT  ! usr bin env ruby require "metasm" include Metasm   produce handler's x86 code sc = Metasm::Shellcode.assemble Metasm::Ia32.new, <<EOS   entry:     mov ecx, 1      shl ecx, 0xA      add edx, 0xBADC0FFE     mov eax, 0x100000      lea eax, [ecx+eax]      add ecx, 0xBADC0FFE      jmp eax EOS   disassemble handler code  dasm = sc.init_disassembler  dasm.disassemble 0    get basic block  bb = dasm.block_at 0  target = dasm.get_xrefs_x bb.list.last .first  puts "[+] jmp target: {target}"   backtrace  values = dasm.backtrace target, bb.list.last.address,      {:log => bt_log = [], :include_start => true}   get_xrefs_x tells you which target is the fi nal jump instruction. Then the  backtrace method is used to walk back through the control fl ow, following  variable dependencies, until it reaches variable assignations or simply hits its  complexity limit. Each step of the backtracker is stored within the array bt_log.  The following adds a few more lines to nicely output the record:  bt_log.each{entry      case type = entry.first      when :start          entry, expr, addr = entry          puts "[start] backtacking expr {expr} from 0x{addr.to_s 16 }"      when :di          entry, to, from, instr = entry          puts "[update] instr {instr},\n  -> update expr from {from} to {to}\n"      when :found         entry, final = entry   c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 299   300   Chapter 5   Obfuscation         puts "[found] possible value: {final.first}\n"      when :up          entry, to, from, addr_down, addr_up = entry          puts "[up] addr 0x{addr_down.to_s 16 } -> 0x{addr_up.to_s 16 }"     end }  Here is the output from the sample:  [+] jmp target: eax [start] backtacking expr eax from 0x1c [update] instr 13h lea eax, [ecx+eax],   -> update expr from eax to ecx+eax  [update] instr 0eh mov eax, 100000h,   -> update expr from ecx+eax to ecx+100000h [update] instr 5 shl ecx, 0ah,   -> update expr from ecx+100000h to  ecx<<0ah +100000h [update] instr 0 mov ecx, 1,   -> update expr from  ecx<<0ah +100000h to 100400h [found] possible value: 100400h  The backtracking engine has been able to walk back the instruction fl ow to  compute the fi nal value of the backtracked expression. A simplifi cation engine  enables solving  or at least reducing  expressions at both the symbolic and  numerical levels.  From the log record it is even possible to extract a slice—that is, the minimal  subset of the original program that produces the studied effect  the slicing  criterion . In this case the slice will contain all the instructions involved in the  computation of the JMP destination:   DecodedInstruction object is the 3rd item of :id entry  slice = bt_log.select{e e.first==:di}.map{e e[3]}.reverse  puts slice  The slice is as follows:  0 mov ecx, 1 5 shl ecx, 0ah 0eh mov eax, 100000h 13h lea eax, [ecx+eax]  Note how nonsignifi cant computations assignations  e.g., the ones using the   constant 0BADC0FFEh  have been eliminated from this list.  That sample is an ideal case: The expression can statically be reduced solved  into a numerical value. Now, imagine you remove the fi rst assembly line  MOV ECX,  1 —within the basic block scope ECX is undefi ned—and then redo the analysis:  [+] jmp target: eax [start] backtacking expr eax from 0x17  [update] instr 0eh lea eax, [ecx+eax],   -> update expr from eax to ecx+eax   c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 300      Chapter 5   Obfuscation   301  [update] instr 9 mov eax, 100000h,   -> update expr from ecx+eax to ecx+100000h  [update] instr 0 shl ecx, 0ah,   -> update expr from ecx+100000h to  ecx<<0ah +100000h  The  return  value  is  an  object  of  type  E x p r e s s i o n  whose  value  is    ECX<<0Ah +100000h.   This example is fairly trivial. The capacity of the backtracker goes far beyond  that. The following modifi es the preceding sample to include a more complex  control-fl ow graph:   produce handler's x86 code  sc = Metasm::Shellcode.assemble Metasm::Ia32.new, <<EOS   entry:     mov ecx, 1      test edx, edx      jnz label inc cl label:     shl ecx, 0xA      add edx, 0xBADC0FFE      mov eax, 0x100000      lea eax, [ecx+eax]      add ecx, 0xBADC0FFE      jmp eax EOS   disassemble handler code  dasm = sc.init_disassembler  dasm.disassemble 0    get last basic block  bblist = dasm.instructionblocks.sort{b1, b2 b1.address   b2.address} bblist.each{bb puts "-\n", bb.list}  bb = bblist.last  Basically, this has inserted an instruction  TEST EDX, EDX  controlling a con- ditional jump; in one case ECX is incremented, in the other it is not. The updated  output is as follows:  [+] jmp target: eax [start] backtacking expr eax from 0x21  [update] instr 18h lea eax, [ecx+eax],   -> update expr from eax to ecx+eax  [update] instr 13h mov eax, 100000h,   -> update expr from ecx+eax to ecx+100000h  [update] instr 0ah shl ecx, 0ah,   -> update expr from ecx+100000h to  ecx<<0ah +100000h [up]    addr 0xa -> 0x9 [up]    addr 0xa -> 0x7 [update] instr 0 mov ecx, 1,   -> update expr from  ecx<<0ah +100000h to 100400h [found] possible value: 100400h  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 301   302   Chapter 5   Obfuscation  [update] instr 9 inc ecx,   -> update expr from  ecx<<0ah +100000h to   ecx+1 <<0ah +100000h [up]    addr 0x9 -> 0x7 [update] instr 0 mov ecx, 1,   -> update expr from   ecx+1 <<0ah +100000h to 100800h [found] possible value: 100800h  The backtracker returns an array of two possible values: 100400h or 100800h.  Note how it has followed the control fl ow over the CFG.  Both branches of the  conditional have been followed.  An [up] tag indicates a basic block’s crossing.  Backtracking really is at the heart of the disassembler and produces a more  accurate disassembly. Obviously, this feature comes with severe performance  penalties  remember the trade-off between computability and precision .  Code Binding You know how to obtain the semantics of an isolated instruction, and you know  how to backtrack a value and compute a slice for that particular value. What if  you could generalize this process and compute the semantics of a basic block?  This is another very powerful feature of Metasm: the code_binding method,  provided by the disassembler object. It totally relies on the backtracking feature.  Here is its usage on the last basic block of the previous example:   compute basic block's semantics  bbsem = dasm.code_binding bb.list.first.address, bb.list.last.address   puts "\n[+] basic block semantics" bbsem.each{key, value puts "    * {key} => {value}"}  Its output is as follows:  [+] basic block semantics     * eax =>   ecx<<0ah +100000h      * ecx =>   ecx<<0ah +badc0ffeh      * edx =>  edx+badc0ffeh   Miasm  Miasm  http:  code.google.com p smiasm  is a reverse engineering framework  developed by Fabrice Desclaux that offers PE ELF manipulation, assembling,  and disassembling  currently supports Ia32, ARM, PPC, and Java bytecode .  Like Metasm, Miasm is open source and released under the GNU Lesser GPL  v2, so you can delve into its engine to customize specifi c needs. The examples  provided in this section are based on the latest revision of MIASM available at  the time of writing  changeset:270:6ee8e9a58648 .  The framework relies on an intermediate language. That means most com- mon instructions have their semantics encoded as a list of expressions. “List”  is to be understood in its Python meaning  i.e., an ordered set of objects .   c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 302      Chapter 5   Obfuscation   303  The grammar of Miasm’s IR makes use of nine basic expression types, the most  important of which are as follows:    ExprInt—Numerical value    ExprId—Identifi er symbol, whatever is not a numerical value; for example,   registers are defi ned as ExprId     ExprAff—Affectation a = b    ExprCond—Ternary conditional operator a ? b : c    ExprMem—Memory indirection    ExprOp—Operation op a,b,...   It also provides full support for slices  think of it as an object to represent  bitfi elds  and slice composition. The IR allows symbolic computations and is  equipped with an expression simplifi cation engine.  For each supported processor, a “sem” suffi xed fi le describes the semantics  of most common instructions. See, for example, the ADD semantics as defi ned  in “miasm arch ia32 sem.py”:  def add info, a, b :      e= []      c = ExprOp '+', a, b      e+=update_flag_arith c       e+=update_flag_af c       e+=update_flag_add a, b, c       e.append ExprAff a, c        return e  This function builds the semantics of the instructions based on its two operands    a and b . One can easily write a piece of script to demonstrate these features:  !  usr bin env python  from miasm.arch.ia32_arch import *  from miasm.tools.emul_helper import *   assemble instruction asm at given address   def instr_sem instr, address :      print "\n[+] instruction %s @ 0x%x" %  instr, address       binary = x86_mn.asm instr       di = x86_mn.dis binary[0]      semantics = get_instr_expr di, address       for expr in semantics:         print "  %s" % expr  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 303   304   Chapter 5   Obfuscation  instr_sem "add eax, 0x1234", 0   instr_sem "mov [eax], 0x1234", 0   instr_sem "ret", 0   instr_sem "je 0x1000", 0  Here is the output:  [+] instruction add eax, 0x1234 @ 0x0    zf =   eax + 0x1234  == 0x0    nf =   0x1 ==   eax + 0x1234  >> 0x1F   & 0x1    pf =  parity  eax + 0x1234   af =    eax + 0x1234  & 0x10  == 0x10     cf =   0x1 ==    eax ^ 0x1234  ^  eax + 0x1234   >> 0x1F   ^         0x1 ==     eax + 0x1234   &  !  eax ^ 0x1234    >> 0x1F       of =  0x1 ==    eax ^  eax + 0x1234   &  !  eax ^ 0x1234    >> 0x1F     eax =  eax + 0x1234   [+] instruction mov [eax], 0x1234 @ 0x0   @32[eax] = 0x1234  [+] instruction ret @ 0x0    esp =  esp +  0x4 + 0x0      eip = @32[esp]  [+] instruction je 0x1000 @ 0x0    eip =  zf == 0x1 ? 0x1000,0  The ADD instruction’s semantics seem the most complex, due to the fl ags  update. Here is the MOV instruction’s semantics with an explicit typing of object:  [+] instruction mov [eax], 0x1234 @ 0x0   ExprAff  ExprMem @32[ExprId eax ]  = ExprInt 0x1234    This is a very appreciable and powerful feature. Built upon the IR, there is a  just-in-time  JIT  compilation feature whereby code is fi rst disassembled, trans- lated into IR, then regenerated as native code for execution. The documentation  and samples provide use cases of Miasm for packer VM analysis as well as  binary instrumentation.  VxStripper  VxStripper is a binary rewriting tool, developed by Sébastien Josse. Designed  for analysis of protected and potentially hostile binary programs, it dynami- cally extracts an intermediate representation of a binary executable and all the  necessary information to apply certain simplifi cations, making the binary inner  workings easier to understand for the analyst.  One of the main motivations behind the design and implementation options  of this tool is to circumvent current limitations of existing malware and binary  programs analysis solutions.  Many tools come with their own intermediate  representation—non-exportable, sometimes proprietary—making diffi cult  their integration. Moreover, many of them are not suitable for analysis of hos- tile or protected code.  The goal is to get as much information as possible from   c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 304      Chapter 5   Obfuscation   305  a binary program that uses all available techniques and tools to protect this  information. The idea is to instrument a virtual computer processing unit and  a guest operating system in a non-intrusive way to dynamically get informa- tion required to rebuild the program and simplify its representation. This tool  is based on the dynamic binary translator engine of QEMU and on the LLVM  compilation chain.   LLVM  Low Level Virtual Machine  is a compilation chain that comes with  a consequent set of optimizations that can be applied across the entire lifetime  of a program. LLVM uses a strongly typed RISC-like instruction set and a static  single assignment  SSA  representation  using this representation, each temporary  variable is assigned only once . LLVM includes many binary back-ends  x86,  x86-64, SPARC, PowerPC, ARM, MIPS, CellSPU, XCore, MSP430, MicroBlaze,  PTX  and some source code back-ends  C, C++ . Readers can refer to the paper  by Lattner31 for further details about LLVM.     The QEMU  Quick EMUlator  Dynamic Binary Translator  DBT  is used to  dynamically translate the binary code from the guest CPU architecture to the host  CPU architecture, through the use of an IR called TCG  Tiny Code Generator .  This language consists of simple RISC-like instructions called micro-operations.  The binary translation consists of two stages. The guest binary code is fi rst  translated in sequences of TCG instructions, called translation blocks  DBT front  end . Then, the translation blocks are converted into code executable by the host  CPU  DBT back end . QEMU’s DBT comes with many binary front ends  x86,  x86-64, ARM, ETRAX CRIS, MIPS, Micro Blaze, PowerPC, SH4, and SPARC .  Readers can refer to the paper from Bellard4 for further details about QEMU.  VxStripper inherits from QEMU the many binary front ends, and from LLVM  the many back ends, providing at reasonable cost a complete binary rewriting  framework. The rewriting functions are implemented as LLVM passes.   Its current design builds upon work already done to convert TCG IR to LLVM  IR  LLVM-QEMU, described by Scheller36, and S2E, described by Chipounov8 ,  as well as upon design algorithms presented by Josse.27, 28  One of the goals of this tool is collaboration with the many software analysis  tools based on the LLVM compilation chain, through an “exported” representa- tion of the malware program. This binary analysis tool is especially designed  to solve the problem of hostile programs analysis. The goal is to automate the  often fastidious and repetitive tasks driven by an analyst.   This compilation chain is based on a modular and evolutionary architecture,  making it possible to apply the same transformations to a wide variety of soft- ware and hardware architectures. It is based on a modern compilation chain,  providing effi cient intermediate representation and functionalities.   Vellvm  Verifi ed LLVM , described by Zhao,43 provides formal tools to reason  on transformations that operate on LLVM’s intermediate representation. Vellvm  can be used to extract formally verifi ed implementations of deobfuscation passes  implemented in VxStripper.  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 305   306   Chapter 5   Obfuscation  QEMU DBT Extension  You have seen that the QEMU DBT engine performs the dynamic translation  of the binary code from the guest processor architecture to the host processor  architecture by using the TCG intermediate representation.  Using a simple example, the following instruction demonstrates what this   The preceding instruction is translated as follows in the QEMU TCG   language looks like:  0x0040104c:  push   0xa  representation:   1     movi_i32 tmp0,$0xa   2     mov_i32 tmp2,esp   3     movi_i32 tmp13,$0xfffffffc  4     add_i32 tmp2,tmp2,tmp13  5     qemu_st32 tmp0,tmp2,$0x1  6     mov_i32 esp,tmp2  7     movi_i32 tmp4,$0x40104e  8     st_i32 tmp4,env,$0x30  9     exit_tb $0x0  This TCG instructions block emulates the execution of the push instruction  on the software CPU. The performed operations are as follows: The integer 0xa  is stored in the variable tmp0  line 1 . This variable is then stored on the stack   lines 2–6 . The address of the instruction following the current instruction is  stored in tmp4  line 7  and then stored in the QEMU VPU register cc_op. The  last instruction  line 9  indicates the end of the TCG block.   The tool modifi es the DBT mechanism in such a way that the instrumentation  function of the virtual CPU is systematically invoked before the execution of a  translation block. To achieve this, you add an extra micro operation  op_callback   that takes as operand the address of the instrumentation function  vpu_callback .    The resulting TCG code is as follows:   1     op_callback @vpu_callback  2     movi_i32 tmp0,$0xa   3     mov_i32 tmp2,esp   4     movi_i32 tmp13,$0xfffffffc  5     add_i32 tmp2,tmp2,tmp13  6     qemu_st32 tmp0,tmp2,$0x1  7     mov_i32 esp,tmp2  8     movi_i32 tmp4,$0x40104e  9     st_i32 tmp4,env,$0x30  10    exit_tb $0x0     c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 306  This mechanism enables you to execute your instrumentation code at each  execution cycle of the virtual CPU. With access to VPU registers and to the  virtual PC memory, you can acquire a process context and extract information  about its interactions with the guest operating system.       Chapter 5   Obfuscation   307  By also instrumenting the load and storing TCG instructions, you can extract  information about the interactions of the target process with the memory of  the guest system. Thanks to this information, you can recover the relocation  information of the process.   Now that you have seen how to modify the QEMU virtual CPU to enable  the systematic invocation of your instrumentation function, let’s examine the  translation of TCG intermediate representation to LLVM representation. The  result of translating the preceding TCG block is as follows:   1   %esp_v.i = load i32* @esp_ptr  2   %tmp2_v.i = add i32 %esp_v.i, -4  3   %4 = inttoptr i32 %tmp2_v.i to i32*  4   store i32 10, i32* %4  5   store i32 %tmp2_v.i, i32* @esp_ptr  6   store i32 4198478, i32* %next.i  7   store i32 0, i32* %ret.i  The integer 0xa is stored at the address pointed to by the variable %4, which  is equivalent to storing it on the stack  lines 1–4 . The address of the instruction  following the current instruction is stored in the variable %next.i  line 6 . The  last instruction  line 7  fi nishes the LLVM block.    After the normalization process, this LLVM block is compiled to the follow-  ing assembly code:  401269!  mov dword ptr [esp-14h], 0ah Now that you have an overview of the main modifi cations applied to the  QEMU emulator, as shown schematically in Figure 5-2, the following section  describes the general architecture of the tool.

These analysis functions extract semantic information from the target pro- gram. This information can be the trace of its interactions with APIs of the  guest operating system, or the way it handles objects and structures of the guest  operating system’s executive or kernel, or more simply its machine code trace. The extraction of this information rests on a description of the guest operat- ing system, which can be provided, for example, by a symbol server, as is the  case for the family of Windows operating systems.   Among the modules already implemented, you notably fi nd the following:    An API hooking module     A forensics analysis module     An unpacking module     A normalization module  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 308      Chapter 5   Obfuscation   309  API Hooking The native and Windows API hooking module of VxStripper is based on forensic  analysis of the guest operating system’s memory, without any interaction with  the guest operating system.    The Windows executive maintains a set of structures that contains information  about the loaded modules for a given process inside its memory space. These  data structures can be recovered by using the process environment block  PEB ,  which can itself be accessed as an offset of segment register FS. The native and  Windows API hooking modules of VxStripper use this information to locate  and instrument Windows API.   Forensics Root-Kit Analysis The forensics module of VxStripper comes with additional features to monitor  and check the integrity of many locations within the guest platform where a  hook can be installed. It walks through executive structures of the operating  system in order to identify potential targets of a root-kit attack and monitor  hardware components that could be corrupted by a root-kit. This information  is crucial for the analyst to understand low-level viral attacks.  For the purposes of this chapter, you can consider these features to be similar  to those expected from a kernel debugger. You can attach a process, view its CPU  state and disassembled code, and trace the interaction of the target program  with the operating system API. This inspection is done in a safe and controlled  environment, without any intrusive interaction with the guest operating system.  The following two sections take a closer look at the working of Vxstripper’s  two most important analysis modules: the unpacking module and the normal- ization module.  Unpacking Module The unpacking module locates the original entry point  OEP  of the target execut- able, gets information relative to its interactions with the operating system API,  and extracts the relocation information.  The underlying idea is a simple integrity check of the target program’s execut- able code: For each translation block of the program, a comparison between its  value in virtual memory and its value on the host fi le system is made. As long  as the values are identical, nothing is done. As soon as a difference is identi- fi ed, the current translation block is written into the raw fi le in place of the old  translation block. The fi rst instruction of the newly generated translation block  is identifi ed as the OEP of the protected program. At the end of the analysis,  data sections are written into the raw fi le in place of original data sections.  The same monitoring algorithm is applied for each translation block. The  protection loader of the packed executable can have several deciphering layers.  As soon as the last deciphered translation block has been reached, the only thing   c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 309   310   Chapter 5   Obfuscation  to be done is to repair the target executable. In order to recover the PE  Portable  Executable  structure of an unprotected executable, several tasks have to be car- ried out: Set the original entry point, rebuild the imports and relocations tables,  and consistency check the PE header.   The method used by the unpacking engine in order to reconstruct the Import  Address Table  IAT  and relocations is based on Win32 and native API hooking.  During the unpacking process, all API calls are traced. A sorted table of API  calls is initialized at load-time, by walking NT executive structures.   Next, after process execution has resumed, each API call is traced. This table  is updated regularly during the target process execution, and is used to dynami- cally resolve API function names. Finally, after a dump of the target process  memory space is completed, this table is used to fi x the IAT in the PE executable. Thanks to the load and store TCG instructions instrumentation, you can  dynamically extract the program’s relocation information, which can also be  added to a new section of the executable.  For example, here is the  useful  information extracted during the unpacking   stage of a program that displays a dialog box  function MessageBoxA :  [INFO] eip=0x00401000 [RELOC] value=0x00403000 va=0x00401003  [RELOC] value=0x0040300f va=0x00401008  [RELOC] value=0x00402008 va=0x00401010  [APICALL] api_pc=0x77d8050b api_oep=0x77d8050b           dll_name=C:\WINDOWS\system32\user32.dll            func_name=MessageBoxA            value=0x00402008 va=0x00401010  The relocation information consists of pairs  va, value , providing the vir- tual address and the value to relocate, respectively. Note that for this packer,  the prologue of the function MessageBoxA is not emulated by the protection.  Otherwise, the external address that is effectively called  api_pc  is different  from the entry point of the API function  api_oep .  Normalization In most cases, after the unpacking stage, you are able to get  automatically  a binary  stripped of its protection loader and without any rewritable code. Unfortunately,  some obfuscation mechanisms  control-fl ow fl attening, VM–based obfuscation  transformations, etc.  have to be handled now in order to fully understand the  inner workings of a malware.   A fi rst attempt to provide a solution to these problems has been implemented  in VxStripper, through the use of the LLVM intermediate representation. Rather  than try to work on the binary after its memory image has been dumped, the  idea is to work on its intermediate representation and increase the amount of  information  that has been dynamically collected  by embedding it in the LLVM  module. Such a representation is more suitable for further analysis.  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 310      Chapter 5   Obfuscation   311  The normalization module uses the output of previous analyses to generate  the LLVM representation of translation blocks, to which several optimization  transformations are applied. Examining this in more detail, during the execu- tion of the target program, the LLVM back end of QEMU TCG outputs the  LLVM representation of translated blocks. This LLVM code is linked with an  initialization LLVM module  see Figure 5-4 .  INITIALIZATION MODULE - System API - Virtual CPU and Stack - Load and Store Callbacks  CLANG  INIT Module  MAIN  INIT Code  VIRTUAL CPU   QEMU   TCG to LLVM  LLVM Module Pass  IMPORTS  INFORMATION  LOAD STORE  MAP  Figure 5-4  This initialization module implements load and store callbacks, declares   system API prototypes, and sets a virtual processor unit and its stack.  The normalization module uses the information dynamically collected during  target program execution to resolve imports, process relocations, and retrieve  data sections. Import table information is used to build LLVM API call instruc- tions. The load store memory map is used to apply relocations and inject data  from the target program into the LLVM module.  When the LLVM module is rebuilt, some additional optimization passes are  applied to its representation. The LLVM can next be compiled to the chosen  architecture, by using one of available LLVM back ends. It can also be translated  to C or C++ code.  First results show that standard optimization used in conjunction with the  partial evaluation induced by the dynamic translation of target code to its  LLVM representation are suffi cient to drastically reduce and simplify the code  under analysis.   c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 311   312   Chapter 5   Obfuscation  Final Thoughts  This section has discussed only four tools  and with a bias toward static analy- sis . Alongside the Metasm and Miasm frameworks, we could have cited the  Radare framework  http:  www.radare.org y  , for example. Rolf Rolles’s  efforts to extend IDA with his idaocaml interpreter  https:  code.google. com p idaocaml   merit attention as well. There are plenty of others that we  did not mention or only briefl y mentioned here, and we encourage you to try  them for yourself.  To put these tools into perspective, although IDA is a good disassembler, it  cannot help much when it comes to dealing with obfuscated code. The Metasm  and Miasm frameworks go a step further, offering more control, an IR to play  with, and so on. Tools such as VxStripper go even further. You can probably  feel it—there is an arms race going on. A huge amount of effort is put into the  development of obfuscators, so our tools have to evolve as well.  As a reverse engineer, developing tools is an investment you make in order to  fulfi ll your objectives; and you expect some sort of return on investment from  it. Most advanced tools can take weeks if not months to build and require a lot  of knowledge.  Practical Deobfuscation Now you will see how some of the tools presented earlier can be used for  practical deobfuscation. Again, there is no ambition of exhaustiveness in the  following sections. Instead, the goal is to illustrate some common use cases of  deobfuscation techniques.  Pattern-Based Deobfuscation  This may be the simplest and cheapest deobfuscation, operating at the syntactical  level and matching known patterns. Don’t forget that early obfuscation patterns  were mainly manually crafted and protected code  like some packer code  and  exhibited only a limited set of patterns; listing them all was thus “acceptable.” This deobfuscation technique comes down to a search and replace algorithm  at the binary  opcode  level  eventually using wildcard searching . The main  drawback is that it leaves you with a binary plagued with NOP instructions.  To illustrate this, take a look at the following old OllyDbg script. Packers are a  classic example of software using obfuscation techniques  in that case to protect  their stubs . For years OllyDbg has been  and probably still is  the favorite tool for  unpacking, and many scripts were released to assist in that task. This  random   old script  2004, by loveboom, http:  tuts4you.com download.php?view.601   targets ASProtect 2.0x versions  a commonly used packer at that time . It takes   c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 312      Chapter 5   Obfuscation   313  advantage of the OllyScript’s REPL commands to search and replace a set of  patterns. A REPL defi nition is as follows:  repl addr, find, repl, len Replace find with repl starting att addr for len bytes.  All patterns are based on the same technique : an unconditional jump inside  its successor instruction is used to confuse disassemblers. The diversity is slightly  improved using instruction prefi xes  like REP or REPNE . The repl instruction is  used to replace these patterns with NOPs:  repl eip,2EEB01??,90909090,1000  repl eip,65EB01??,90909090,1000  repl eip,F2EB01??,90909090,1000  repl eip,F3EB01??,90909090,1000  repl eip,EB01??,909090,1000  repl eip,26EB02????,9090909090,1000  repl eip,3EEB02????,9090909090,1000  Here we only operate at the syntactic level. Considering a target with a lim-  ited set of patterns, this deobfuscation technique is trivial, however effi cient:     Application cost is limited if not negligible.     Development cost is also almost null. Of course, as with virus signatures and AV engines, polymorphism and  diversity make it useless. An equivalent script could have been developed using  IDA’s scripting capabilities. That’s typically the kind of script you can create  when analyzing trivially obfuscated malware and or packers, when speed of  analysis has priority.  Program-Analysis-Based Deobfuscation  Now consider the following obfuscated code sample  this is only a very small  extract; obfuscated code continues like this for thousands of instructions :  .text:00405900  loc_405900: .text:00405900      add edx, 67E37DA7h .text:00405906      push    esi .text:00405907      mov esi, 0D0B763Ah .text:0040590C      push    eax .text:0040590D      mov eax, 15983FC8h .text:00405912      neg eax .text:00405914      inc eax .text:00405915      inc eax .text:00405916      jmp loc_4082AD .text:004082AD  loc_4082AD: .text:004082AD      not eax .text:004082AF      and eax, 1D48516Ch .text:004082B4      sub eax, 0ACE1B37Ah  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 313   314   Chapter 5   Obfuscation  .text:004082B9      xor esi, eax .text:004082BB      pop eax .text:004082BC      xor edx, esi .text:004082BE      pop esi .text:004082BF      and ecx, edx .text:004082C1  jmp loc_407C54  You likely recognize, from the fi rst sections of this chapter, some of the obfus- cation techniques used here, especially constant unfolding. Please also note  that unconditional jumps are inserted to split code into basic blocks that are  then distributed  randomly reordered  across the binary. There is no obvious  pattern, at least none you could possibly and effectively match at the syntactical  level using signatures.  You need to step up to the semantical level. Based on the output of a disas- sember, you could start working on the control fl ow, merging the basic blocks  405900h and 4082ADh. Then, you could work on the data fl ow, considering the  two instructions:  .text:0040590D    mov eax, 15983FC8h .text:00405912    neg eax  Based on the semantics of these instructions, you know that the EAX register  is fi rst assigned with a constant value and then negged. You could precompute  the NEG instruction and rewrite this in a simpler form, by assigning EAX with  the negged value:  .text:0040590D    mov eax, EA67C038h  Rewriting programs in a simpler form, precomputing values that do not  depend on the program’s input, removing useless code—that is program opti- mization, and compilers have done that almost since their creation. You can  adapt and reuse these techniques for your own purposes, and an abundant  body of literature is available on this topic. Some classical compiler optimiza- tion techniques include the following:     Peephole optimization    Constant folding propagation    Dead store elimination    Operation folding    Dead code elimination    Etc.  This approach is exactly what is proposed by the Optimice deobfuscation  plugin for IDA. Some previous works, by Gazet and Guillot22 and by Josse,29 have  also been presented, respectively as a Metasm plugin and a VxStripper plugin.  The idea is to normalize the code in order to get a reduced optimized canonical  form, which is simpler to analyze and closer to the original, unprotected, code.  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 314      Chapter 5   Obfuscation   315  These attempts to provide deobfuscation frameworks utilities are still far  from perfect. In addition, not many tools are available to the average reverser to  attack obfuscated programs  of course, some private advanced tools exist here  and there . The future of deobfuscation will probably take the form of elaborated  tools and analysis platforms based on formal IR. Rolf Rolles presented some of his  results with his own framework written in OCaml34. Other popular frameworks  that could be used include LLVM-based SecondWrite  Smithson et al., 200739 ,  S2e revgen  Chipounov, 20017 , or BitBlaze  Song et al., 200840 and their works  since . Efforts in deobfuscation will have to match those put into obfuscation.  Complex Analysis  This section discusses two of the most impactful obfuscation techniques: code  virtualization and code fl attening. For these techniques, you clearly need to  work at a semantic level.  Simple VM Implementations There are mainly two forms of VM implementations. The most straightforward  form is to develop a simple processor emulator. Algorithmically speaking, it  would include the following steps:   1.  Loop:         2.  Update the instruction pointer or exit the loop.  a.  Fetch —Read the bytecode stream at the instruction pointer. b.  Decode—Decode the instruction’s opcode and its operands. c.  Execute—Call the appropriate opcode handler.   In this confi guration, each instruction handler is responsible for updating  the context of the VM. The context represents the underlying emulated archi- tecture. It probably consists of a set registers, and eventually a memory area.  Each handler implements a distinctive instruction of the emulated processor   one handler for the ADD, one for the SUB, etc. .  This form is often used by the simpler implementations. Handlers are totally  independent of one another, and the instruction pointer is increased by the size  of the instruction  except for instructions that directly modify it .  From an attacker’s point of view, this type of implementation is easily recogniz- able. Following is a detailed look at the steps generally required to analyze a VM:   1.  Understand how an instruction is decoded from raw bytecode: which  part encodes for the operation  handler number , which part encodes the  operand s , and so on.    2.  Deduct VM’s architecture from instructions’ operands: number of registers,   memory layout, I O interfaces, etc.  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 315   316   Chapter 5   Obfuscation    3.  Undertake handler analysis. Once operand decoding is known, you can  look at the way each handler manipulates the various operand s  it pos- sibly takes as argument s . This step is the essence of VM analysis: Each  handler is associated with its own semantics.  With all these pieces of knowledge, you can fi nally build a disassembler-like   tool that enables you to disassemble the bytecode of the VM.  In 2006, Maximus published two great papers about VM reversing: “Reversing  a simple virtual machine”32 and “Virtual machines re-building”33. One of the  targets he used  HyperUnpackme2  was also covered in depth by Rolf Rolles the  same year35.   Although these are useful contributions from talented reversers, VM analy- sis remains a somewhat manual and repetitive job: One has to develop a new  disassembler for each new instance of VM. Moreover, protections authors have  also reacted, hardening their implementations of VMs.  Advanced VM Implementations More advanced VM implementations derive from the simple type but add  important features to harden the implementations and make them more resil- ient to analysis:     Loop unrolling—This classical compiler optimization technique favors  the time  speed  aspect of a program’s space vs. time trade-off. It replaces  the loop structure by the sequential invocations of the loop body  thus  unrolled . Applied to a VM, each handler is made responsible for fetching  and decoding its own operand s , and then updates the context accordingly.    Code-fl attening—The VM’s main execution loop is fl attened. That means  each handler is responsible for updating the instruction pointer  pointer  on the bytecode . Actually, code-fl attening and VM-based obfuscation are  basically the same thing. Code-fl attening only virtualizes retargets the  control fl ow of the protected code, whereas virtual-machine obfuscation  virtualizes retargets both the control fl ow and the data fl ow. You can use  almost the same algorithms to follow a code-fl atten dispatcher’s context  and a VM context.     Bytecode encoding encryption—Each invocation of the VM depends on  an encryption key that is passed to the VM as part of its context initializa- tion. Each handler updates that key, resulting in a turning key. The han- dlers depend on the turning key to decode their operands from encoded  bytecode. An attacker cannot start analyzing the VM at a chosen point,  as the value of the key at this point would be unknown.     Code obfuscation—The native code of the VM is obfuscated using tech- niques like the one described at the beginning of this chapter. Simply  looking at a handler’s code provides no clue about its semantics.  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 316      Chapter 5   Obfuscation   317  In summary, hardened implementations of VMs are more diffi cult to analyze  statically by an order of magnitude. For each state of the VM, an attacker has to  know at least the following mandatory values:     Bytecode pointer    Instruction pointer, the value of the next handler to be executed    Turning encryption key  VMs have reached a new level of complexity, thus necessitating a new level  of attack. Handlers are more complex to analyze; moreover, they cannot be  analyzed in isolation  one would not know the value of the encryption key,  for example . An attacker wants to limit the manual analysis to a minimum.  Nevertheless, a manual review is most often required to “capture” the general  behavior of a VM and thus infer possible attacks on it.  One of the fi rst places of interest is the VM invocation stub—i.e., the transi- tion between native  nonvirtualized  code and the VM interpreter. The context  initialization indicates the nature of the mapping between the native architecture  and the VM’s architecture. It may be a carbon copy of native registers to the  VM’s registers or something more complicated. Also, at this point, it is helpful  to distinguish  as much as possible  between mandatory initialization variables   such as a VM’s key, handler number, or entry point  for which a numerical value  is required, and extra variables that can be kept symbolic.  The second place of major interest is the VM’s dispatcher  if it exists . Most  often there is a single point of dispatch that basically retrieves the next handler  from a handlers table based on an index stored somewhere within the VM’s  context. A question to answer is, what is the break condition of this execution  loop? In this confi guration it is possible to consider the VM as a generalization  of code-fl attening. Code-fl attening virtualizes only the control fl ow, whereas  the VM virtualizes both the control and data fl ows. Moreover, code-fl attening  most often only operates at single function level, whereas the VM operates at  the program level. The other possibility is a distributed dispatch, whereby each  handler is responsible for updating the VM’s instruction pointer and linking  to the next handler.  These are general ideas; each reverser has his or her own tricks and abstrac-  tions of the problem.  Using Metasm The approach we are going to explore is based on the Metasm framework.  It relies on symbolic execution to make the VM  i.e., interpreter  process the  bytecode  with respect to static data  and compute the residual program. On  the one hand, there is a program  the interpreter ; on the other hand, there is  its static data  the bytecode ; we will specialize the program with respect to  its static data.  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 317   318   Chapter 5   Obfuscation  Considering an obfuscated program and its data as a whole would be too  complex, the solution is to break this complex problem into multiple, simpler  sub-problems. Considering virtual machine’s instruction handlers level provides  a far more appropriate granularity. From now on, we will consider instruction  handlers as the interpreter’s smallest unit of semantics.  Based on that basic premise, you can apply the following pseudo algorithm:   1.  Capture the current context  VM’s bytecode, static parameters, known   environment, etc. .    2.  Disassemble the current handler.   3.  Deobfuscate code, if necessary.   4.  Compute its semantics  i.e., transfer function .   5.  Generate output from solved semantics.   6.  Compute next state  i.e., apply the transfer function to the current context .   7.  If the handler’s dispatcher doesn’t reach a break exit condition, repeat   from step 1.  Optionally, you may be able to regenerate native code from the transfer func- tion computed at step 4. As expressed by Futamura21, given an interpreter of  Linterpreted written in a given native language Lnative , it is possible to automatically  compute a compiler from Linterpreted to Lnative.  This is suitable for the theoretical concepts. Now suppose that you face an   instance of a VM. Where do you start? Let’s take a practical example.  The following script makes use of Metasm to compile and then disassemble  what could be a handler from a VM. For the sake of simplicity, this example  deals only with the VM’s part  thus, code is not obfuscated . The handler’s code  is located in 10000000h, while a data section containing the handler’s bytecode  is located in 1a000000h:   encoding: ASCII-8BIT  ! usr bin env ruby   require "metasm"  include Metasm  $SPAWN_GUI = false CODE_BASE_ADDR = 0x10000000 HTABLE_BASE_ADDR = 0x18000000 DATA_BASE_ADDR = 0x1A000000 INJECT_MAX_ITER = 0x20  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 318  NATIVE_REGS = [:eax, :edx, :ecx, :ebx, :esp, :ebp, :esi, :edi]  def display bd    bd.each{key,value puts "  {Expression[key]} => {Expression[value]}"} end      Chapter 5   Obfuscation   319   produce handler's x86 code sc = Metasm::Shellcode.assemble Metasm::Ia32.new, <<EOS   lodsd mov ecx, eax  xor ecx, ebp  movzx eax, cl push eax  mov eax, [edi+eax]  movzx edx, ch mov edx, [edi+edx]  xor eax, edx  pop edx  mov [edi+edx], eax  lodsd xor ebp, 0x35ef6a14  xor eax, ebp jmp [{HTABLE_BASE_ADDR}+eax*4]  EOS   handler = sc.encode_string   data section hex  data_section_hex = "\xA3\xCB\xDB\x5F\x60\xBD\x34\x6A"   add a code section  dasm = sc.init_disassembler  dasm.add_section EncodedData.new handler , CODE_BASE_ADDR    add a data section dasm.add_section EncodedData.new data_section_hex , DATA_BASE_ADDR    disassemble handler code dasm.disassemble_fast_deep CODE_BASE_ADDR   The fi rst thing to do is automatically get the semantics of that handler. As men- tioned previously, Metasm offers a method called code_binding that computes  the function transfer  Metasm’s terminology is binding  of a set of instructions.  Thus, you can write the following:   compute handler's semantics  bb = dasm.di_at CODE_BASE_ADDR .block  start_addr = bb.list.first.address  end_addr = bb.list.last.address puts "[+] from 0x{start_addr.to_s 16 }, to 0x{end_addr.to_s 16 }"  binding = dasm.code_binding start_addr, end_addr   display binding   The preceding produces the following output:  [+] from 0x10000000, to address 10000021    dword ptr [esp] =>  dword ptr [esi]^ebp &0ffh    dword ptr [edi+  dword ptr [esi]^ebp &0ffh ] =>  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 319   320   Chapter 5   Obfuscation      dword ptr [edi+  dword ptr[esi]^ebp &0ffh ] ^     dword ptr [edi+   dword ptr[esi]>>8 ^ ebp>>8  &0ffh ]   eax =>  dword ptr [esi+4]^ ebp^35ef6a14h  &0ffffffffh    ecx =>  dword ptr [esi]^ebp &0ffffffffh    edx =>  dword ptr [esi]^ebp &0ffh    ebp =>  ebp^35ef6a14h &0ffffffffh    esi =>  esi+8 &0ffffffffh  From both the assembly and the binding, you can say the following about   the VM:     It seems to use a turning key store in EBP.  Note how it is used to decrypt   the instruction’s operands from bytecode.      Its context seems to be pointed to by EDI.  That’s a good start, but you are still far from the objective. You are still stuck  at the assembly level, so let’s step back and consider the VM initialization, which  we have identifi ed as follows:  pushad pop [edi] pop [edi+0x4] pop [edi+0x8] pop [edi+0xC] pop [edi+0x10]  pop [edi+0x14]  pop [edi+0x18]  pop [edi+0x1C]  First, native registers are pushed onto the stack, and then they are read from  the stack into a memory area pointed to by EDI, which in turn is responsible for  pointing at the VM’s context. This information enables you to create a mapping  between the VM’s symbolic internals and assembly expression:  vm_symbolism = {     :eax => :nhandler,     :ebp => :vmkey,     :esi => :bytecode_ptr,     Indirection[[:edi], 4, nil] => :vm_edi,     Indirection[[:edi, :+, 4], 4, nil] => :vm_esi,     Indirection[[:edi, :+, 8], 4, nil] => :vm_ebp,     Indirection[[:edi, :+, 0xC], 4, nil] => :vm_esp,     Indirection[[:edi, :+, 0x10], 4, nil] => :vm_ebx,     Indirection[[:edi, :+, 0x14], 4, nil] => :vm_edx,     Indirection[[:edi, :+, 0x18], 4, nil] => :vm_ecx,     Indirection[[:edi, :+, 0x1c], 4, nil] => :vm_eax, }  This symbolism is injected into the binding  each occurrence of a left value  is replaced by its associated right value . Expressions have a special method  named bind that does exactly that. The following example fi rst defi nes a symbolic   c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 320      Chapter 5   Obfuscation   321  expression: the addition of two terms, one of them being an indirection; and  two symbols are involved, :a and :b. Next, symbol :a is associated  bound   with the value 1000h:  expr = Expression[[:a, 4], :+, :b]  sym = {:a => 0x1000}  puts expr  >> dword ptr [a]+b  puts expr.bind sym  >> dword ptr [1000h]+b  You can generalize this for each expression of the binding. This mapping is  the key that enables abstracting VM’s code from its implementation level up to  the VM semantics level. Moreover, a positive side effect of this step is often a  signifi cant reduction of the binding’s complexity. The new binding is as follows:  [+] symbolic binding    dword ptr [esp] =>  dword ptr [bytecode_ptr]^vmkey &0ffh    dword ptr [edi+  dword ptr [bytecode_ptr]^vmkey &0ffh ] =>    dword ptr [edi+dword ptr [bytecode_ptr]^vmkey &0ffh ]^    dword ptr[edi+   dword ptr [bytecode_ptr]>>8 ^ vmkey>>8  &0ffh ]   nhandler =>  dword ptr [bytecode_ptr+4]^ vmkey^35ef6a14h  &0ffffffffh    vmkey =>  vmkey^35ef6a14h &0ffffffffh    bytecode_ptr =>  bytecode_ptr+8 &0ffffffffh  We have made progress, but the encryption is still problematic and we  cannot go further if the VM’s context at the execution time of this handler is  unknown: bytecode pointer, turning key, and optionally the handler number  are all required values. Assuming you know these values  you are at the VM’s  entry point or you have dynamically traced the VM up to that point , you can  defi ne a pseudo-context:  context = {     :nhandler => 0x84,     :vmkey => 0x5fdbd7b7,     :bytecode_ptr => DATA_BASE_ADDR,     :virt_eax => 0xffeeffee,     :virt_ecx => 0,     :virt_edx => 0x41414141,     :virt_ebx => 1,     :virt_edi => :virt_edi,  }  Note that the context contains both symbolic and numerical values. For example,  nhandler is defi ned as equal to 84h, while the VM’s register virt_edi is symbolic. The context is then injected within the binding, as well as the symbolism  defi ned previously. In practice that’s an iterative process, but let’s not get over- loaded with implementation details. Expressions are progressively solved and   c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 321   322   Chapter 5   Obfuscation  reduced with respect to all known values, which include the current context  and the program’s data  i.e., the bytecode . At the end you have a solved bind- ing, which actually represents the context of the VM after the execution of the  handler. We call that step symbolic execution:  [+] binding solver   [+] key: dword ptr [esp]     => solved key: dword ptr [esp]    [+] value:  dword ptr [bytecode_ptr]^vmkey &0ffh     [+] solved memory read at 0x1a000000, size 4     [+] value 5fdbcba3h      => solved value: 14h    [+] key: dword ptr [edi+  dword ptr [bytecode_ptr]^vmkey &0ffh ]     [+] solved memory read at 0x1a000000, size 4     [+] value 5fdbcba3h     => solved key: virt_edx    [+] value: dword ptr [edi+  dword ptr [bytecode_ptr]^vmkey &0ffh ]^          dword ptr [edi+   dword ptr [bytecode_ptr]>>8 ^ vmkey>>8  &0ffh ]     [+] solved memory read at 0x1a000000, size 4     [+] value 5fdbcba3h     [+] solved memory read at 0x1a000000, size 4     [+] value 5fdbcba3h     => solved value: 0beafbeafh    [+] key: nhandler     => solved key: nhandler    [+] value:  dword ptr [bytecode_ptr+4]^ vmkey^35ef6a14h  &0ffffffffh     [+] solved memory read at 0x1a000004, size 4     [+] value 6a34bd60h     => solved value: 0c3h    [+] key: vmkey     => solved key: vmkey     [+] value:  vmkey^35ef6a14h &0ffffffffh     => solved value: 6a34bda3h    [+] key: bytecode_ptr      => solved key: bytecode_ptr     [+] value:  bytecode_ptr+8 &0ffffffffh     => solved value: 1a000008h  [+] solved binding    virt_edx => 0beafbeafh    nhandler => 0c3h   vmkey => 6a34bda3h    bytecode_ptr => 1a000008h  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 322      Chapter 5   Obfuscation   323  The expression solver helps to compute the fi nal values of the fi rst handler’s  binding: the next handler to be executed as well as the updated value of the  turning key. Updating the context is a trivial operation:   updated_context = context.update solved_binding   puts "\n[+] updated context"  display updated_context   [+] updated context   nhandler => 0c3h    vmkey => 6a34bda3h    bytecode_ptr => 1a000008h    virt_eax => 0ffeeffeeh    virt_ecx => 0    virt_edx => 0beafbeafh    virt_ebx => 1    virt_edi => virt_edi  You can repeat this process and walk through the whole control-fl ow graph of  the VM. This is a quite appreciable result; nevertheless, pure numerical values  somewhat hide the semantics of the handler. Moreover, one of the objectives is  to regenerate native assembly code equivalent to the contextualized execution  of the handler.  A trick we often use when analyzing a VM with Metasm is to proceed to a  double symbolic execution for each handler: one with the full context  mainly  numerical values, used to update the context  and another one with an almost  purely symbolic context  used to extract the high-level semantics . The next code  sample demonstrates the use of a symbolic context:  symbolic_context = {    :nhandler => 0x84,   :vmkey => 0x5fdbd7b7,   :bytecode_ptr => DATA_BASE_ADDR,   :virt_eax => :virt_eax,   :virt_ecx => :virt_ecx,   :virt_edx => :virt_edx,   :virt_ebx => :virt_ebx,   :virt_edi => :virt_edi, }  solved_symolic_binding = sym_exec symbolic_context,                                    symbolic_binding,                                    vm_symbolism  puts "\n[+] solved binding" display solved_symbolic_binding    This time the output is as follows:  [+] binding solver    [+] key: dword ptr [esp]     => solved key: dword ptr [esp]  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 323   324   Chapter 5   Obfuscation    [+] value:  dword ptr [bytecode_ptr]^vmkey &0ffh     [+] solved memory read at 0x1a000000, size 4     [+] value 5fdbcba3h     => solved value: 14h    [+] key: dword ptr [edi+  dword ptr [bytecode_ptr]^vmkey &0ffh ]     [+] solved memory read at 0x1a000000, size 4     [+] value 5fdbcba3h     => solved key: virt_edx    [+] value: dword ptr [edi+  dword ptr [bytecode_ptr]^vmkey &0ffh ]^        dword ptr edi+   dword ptr [bytecode_ptr]>>8 ^ vmkey>>8  &0ffh ]      [+] solved memory read at 0x1a000000, size 4      [+] value 5fdbcba3h      [+] solved memory read at 0x1a000000, size 4      [+] value 5fdbcba3h     => solved value: virt_edx^virt_eax    [+] key: nhandler     => solved key: nhandler    [+] value:  dword ptr [bytecode_ptr+4]^ vmkey^35ef6a14h  &0ffffffffh      [+] solved memory read at 0x1a000004, size 4      [+] value 6a34bd60h     => solved value: 0c3h    [+] key: vmkey     => solved key: vmkey    [+] value:  vmkey^35ef6a14h &0ffffffffh     => solved value: 6a34bda3h   [+] key: bytecode_ptr     => solved key: bytecode_ptr    [+] value:  bytecode_ptr+8 &0ffffffffh     => solved value: 1a000008h    [+] solved binding     virt_edx => virt_edx^virt_eax     nhandler => 0c3h      vmkey => 6a34bda3h      bytecode_ptr => 1a000008h  Finally, you can simply reject VM control stuff from the solved binding, leav-  ing you with the following:  vm_edx => vm_edx^vm_eax  From that fi nal result, native code regeneration is pretty straightforward.  You iterate this process over the VM’s control-fl ow graph for each handler. As  a general observation, when using this technique, a sensitive choice is when to  keep symbolic values and when to reduce to numerical values. The fi rst option   c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 324      Chapter 5   Obfuscation   325  favors the recovery of high-level semantics, while the second enables an easier  VM’s control-fl ow recovery. At the end, it is also possible to further proceed the  output. Imagine a VM that looks like a stack-based interpreter:  01: push vm_edx 02: add [esp], vm_eax 03: pop vm_edx  Using classic deobfuscation methods such as compiler optimizations would   rewrite the preceding three lines as follows:  01: add vm_eax, vm_eax   Please note that the bytecode itself could have been obfuscated.  Code-Flattening Deobfuscation As previously stated, code-fl attening can be viewed as partial virtualization  only  the control fl ow is virtualized . Thus, techniques described for VM analysis, and  especially symbolic execution, can also be applied for fl attened code analysis.  There are still some diffi culties that are specifi c to this technique:    Code-fl attening transformation is most often applied at the function level  and sometimes there may be more than one fl attened “node” in the same  function. Overall that means there are multiple instances of the techniques;  thus a tool has to be bulletproof and fully automatic.     Discerning between a function’s original code and added dispatcher’s code  is diffi cult when code-fl attening implementation is robust  program and  dispatcher data fl ows are fi rmly interleaved  interdependent .     Inverse transformation is not trivial to implement.  Using VxStripper To illustrate the use of VxStripper on a simple “toy” example, consider the fol- lowing program  which displays y = 22  after unpacking and reconstruction:    ...... ! entrypoint:   ...... !   push    ebp   401001 !   mov     ebp, esp   401003 !   sub     esp, 10h   401006 !   mov     dword ptr [ebp-4], 0   40100d !   mov     dword ptr [ebp-0ch], 2   401014 !   mov     dword ptr [ebp-8], 0ah   40101b !   ...... ! loc_40101b:             ...... !   cmp     dword ptr [ebp-0ch], 6   40101f !   jnl     loc_40108c   401021 !   mov     eax, [ebp-0ch]   401024 !   mov     [ebp-10h], eax   401027 !   mov     ecx, [ebp-10h]   40102a !   sub     ecx, 2  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 325   326   Chapter 5   Obfuscation    40102d !   mov     [ebp-10h], ecx   401030 !   cmp     dword ptr [ebp-10h], 3   401034 !   ja      loc_40108a   401036 !   mov     edx, [ebp-10h]   401039 !   jmp     dword ptr [edx*4+data_4010a4]   401040     mov     dword ptr [ebp-4], 2   401047     mov     dword ptr [ebp-0ch], 3   40104e     jmp     loc_40108a   401050     cmp     dword ptr [ebp-8], 0   401054     jng     40105fh   401056     mov     dword ptr [ebp-0ch], 4   40105d     jmp     401066h   40105f     mov     dword ptr [ebp-0ch], 6   401066     jmp     loc_40108a   401068     mov     eax, [ebp-4]   40106b     add     eax, 2   40106e     mov     [ebp-4], eax   401071     mov     dword ptr [ebp-0ch], 5   401078     jmp     loc_40108a   40107a     mov     ecx, [ebp-8]   40107d     sub     ecx, 1   401080     mov     [ebp-8], ecx   401083     mov     dword ptr [ebp-0ch], 3   40108a !   ...... ! loc_40108a:                        ...... !   jmp     loc_40101b   40108c !   ...... ! loc_40108c:                        ...... !   mov     edx, [ebp-4]   40108f !   push    edx   401090 !   push    strz_yd_402008   401095 !   call    dword ptr [msvcrt.dll:printf]   40109b !   add     esp, 8   40109e !   xor     eax, eax   4010a0 !   mov     esp, ebp   4010a2 !   pop     ebp   4010a3 !   ret    return 0;    ...... !   push    eax   4011f1 !   mov     dword ptr [esp-0ch], 0ah   4011f9 !   mov     dword ptr [esp-8], 4   401201 !   dec     dword ptr [esp-0ch]   401205 !   add     dword ptr [esp-8], 2   40120a !   dec     dword ptr [esp-0ch]   40120e !   add     dword ptr [esp-8], 2   401213 !   dec     dword ptr [esp-0ch]   401217 !   add     dword ptr [esp-8], 2   40121c !   dec     dword ptr [esp-0ch]   401220 !   add     dword ptr [esp-8], 2  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 326  The control-fl ow graph  CFG  of such a program is fl attened.

However, one of the future goals of this project is to enable the tool to interact  with other analysis tools. By design, this tool may be able to collaborate with  any software analysis tool based on the LLVM compilation chain.  The LLVM compilation chain and the many LLVM-based tools already provide  a great library of program analyses that can be used together to defeat malware  protection mechanisms.   In addition, Vellvm  Verifi ed LLVM  may be used to formally extract verifi ed  implementations of deobfuscation passes implemented by VxStripper. In addition  to malware threat analysis, other uses of this tool can also be imagined, such  as detection scheme extraction, software protections, and antivirus software  robustness analysis.  Case Study  The sample we’ll use for this case study is actually a crackme originally posted  on Crackmes.de by quetz in 2007. Even though it is a “only” a crackme, it features  most of the concepts that one would fi nd in a professional-grade protection.  Among other rejoicings it contains the following:     Code-fl attening     Variable encoding     Code virtualization   Here is how the author introduces its challenge:  Lately, protection from static analysis becomes more and more popular.  Almost every protector employs some kind of obfuscation, virtual machine,  etc... This keygenme is an attempt to show what happens if you abuse idea  of obfuscation. Can human effectively analyze such code? Maybe with an  assistance of a tool?  —http:  crackmes.de users quetz q_keygenme_1.0   Fortunately, we have tools and in this section we will use them. Before start- ing, we recommend that you not look at the symbols section contained within  the binary. As an aside, previous versions of IDA Pro  maybe inferior to 6.2   didn’t load these symbols and the author of these lines cheerfully failed to look  for them.  First Impressions Launching the executable offers you the opportunity to input a username and a  password. After clicking the Check button, a message box appears and displays  the validity of your credentials.  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 328      Chapter 5   Obfuscation   329  If you’ve carefully read the previous chapters of this book, you have probably  already fi red up your favorite disassembler and targeted the GUI’s DialogProc  callback function.  Let’s fi rst look at the general architecture of the protected code. The control- fl ow graph is way too messy to be natural compiler-generated code: We have an  obfuscated DialogProc calling two code-fl attened functions  func1@0x430DB0,  func2@0x431E00 . These two functions themselves call what seems to be a VM   vm@0x401360 .  We have already discussed the VM’s single dispatch point; this one is pretty  straightforward to spot  look for an important jump table in the absence of any  other clues :  01: .text:00401F20  02: mov    ebp, [esp+13Ch] 03: cmp    ebp, 3E2Dh; switch 15918 cases 04: ja short loc_401F36 05: jmp    ds:off_43D000[ebp*4]; switch jump These are our two fi rst and almost free pieces of knowledge about the VM:  It stores its current handler number in [ESP+13Ch] and there are 15,918 entries  in the dispatcher  for now, we cannot conclude whether they are all different  handlers .  Before getting our hands dirty, we can try to do some black-box analysis  of the func1 and func2 functions. We know func1 and func2 call the VM; we  simply log every call to the VM and especially the number of the fi rst handler  that is called  a sort of entry point in the VM code . That seems quite trivial but  one should never disregard low-hanging fruit.  Results are immediately revealing: func2 is called before func1, so we will  start with func2. As soon as you look at the logs of the VM’s entry point, these  patterns stand out:     546h-0BFFh-7B2h-9A2h-405h-919h-3B9h—624 times    0CF5h-15Eh-184h-39Ch-5B0h-3C0h-0F75h—624 times    0A06h-0xA29h-0x268h-0xCB3h—227 times    736h-13Ah-1EBh-897h—396 times    150h-8ABh-843h-697h-474h—200 times  That’s actually already a lot of information. If you look at the .data section,   an extra hint is waiting:  01: .data:0043CA44  dword_43CA4402: .data:0043CA48  dd 9908B0DFh Where does 9908B0DFh come from? And 624? And 227? Well, either you are  really familiar with random number generators or you look for these values;  they identify a Mersenne twister pseudo-random generator algorithm. 624  and 397 are the period parameters, while 9908B0DFh is a constant used during  number generation.  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 329   330   Chapter 5   Obfuscation  We have identifi ed a critical weakness of the protection: Virtualized code  leaks some information about the structure of the protected algorithm, mak- ing it trivial to recover loop iterations. Nevertheless, do we have nicely crafted  virtualized code nullifi ed with one breakpoint? Not yet. We have an algorithm  candidate but it needs to be confi rmed.  Again, one should never reverse engineer some code when it is possible to  guess  and validate  information! In this case, a black-box analysis reveals a lot  simply by looking at the inputs outputs of functions func1 and func2. A basic  strategy like this or differential analysis of VM execution can sometimes be of  great help. Let’s refi ne our analysis of these two functions:      func2     Input—Two arguments: an address on the stack that seems to be an  array of integers, and a 32-bit value that seems to depend on the length  of the name.     Output—Nothing remarkable except that the integers array has been   updated.     Occurrence—Called a single time, at the beginning and before func1.    Guess—Mersenne twister initialization, the array is actually the state  of the PNRG. The 32-bit value is the initialization seed. This can be  further validated by matching loop parameters  learned from the logs   with a standard initialization function.     func1     Input—Two arguments: the address of the  supposed  PRNG state and   a 32-bit value that seems to be a letter from the username.     Output—Returns a 32-bit random value.    Occurrence—Called 100 times.    Guess—Mersenne twister rand32-like function.  Analyzing Handlers Semantics It is now time to analyze the VM. The main dispatcher has already been found  at [ESP+13ch]. It is often a good idea to manually check a few handlers to see  how they access the VM’s context, how they update the program counter and  or bytecode pointer, and so on.  This process can be applied on a random handler—for example, the one   starting at 0x41836c:  01: .text:0041836C loc_41836C: 02:        ; DATA XREF: .rdata:off_43D000 03:        ; jumptable 00401F2F cases 2815,4091 04: .text:0041836C  movzx ecx, [esp+3D8h+var_2A2]  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 330      Chapter 5   Obfuscation   331  05: .text:00418374  mov   esi, 97Fh 06: .text:00418379  mov   ebx, [esp+3D8h+var_3C8] 07: .text:0041837D  movzx edi, [esp+3D8h+var_29E] 08: .text:00418385  add   [esp+3D8h+var_3C0], 94Eh 09: .text:0041838D  imul  eax, ecx, 1Ch 10: .text:00418390  sub   [esp+3D8h+var_3C4], 0FF0h 11: .text:00418398  imul  ecx, edi, 5DDh 12: .text:0041839E  mov   [esp+3D8h+var_37C], esi 13: .text:004183A2  lea   edx, [eax+ebx+5C8h] 14: .text:004183A9  mov   ebx, 97Fh 15: .text:004183AE  mov   [esp+3D8h+var_3C8], edx 16: .text:004183B2  sub   ebx, ecx 17: .text:004183B4  lea   edx, [ebp+ebx+29Dh+var_8BC] 18: .text:004183BB  mov   [esp+3D8h+var_378], ebx 19: .text:004183BF  mov   [esp+3D8h+var_380], ebx 20: .text:004183C3  mov   [esp+3D8h+var_29D+1], edx 21: .text:004183CA  jmp   loc_401F20  Let’s get some help from Metasm. As shown previously, we can use the code-  binding method to compute the semantics of a chunk of code:  dword ptr [esp+10h] => 1ch*byte ptr [esp+136h]+dword ptr [esp+10h]+5c8h dword ptr [esp+14h] => dword ptr [esp+14h]-0ff0h  dword ptr [esp+18h] => dword ptr [esp+18h]+94eh  dword ptr [esp+58h] => -5ddh*byte ptr [esp+13ah]+97fh  dword ptr [esp+5ch] => 97fh  dword ptr [esp+60h] => -5ddh*byte ptr [esp+13ah]+97fh dword ptr [esp+13ch] => ebp-5ddh*byte ptr [esp+13ah]+360h  eax =>  1ch*byte ptr [esp+136h] &0ffffffffh  ecx =>  5ddh*byte ptr [esp+13ah] &0ffffffffh  edx =>  ebp-5ddh*byte ptr [esp+13ah]+360h &0ffffffffh  ebx =>  -5ddh*byte ptr [esp+13ah]+97fh &0ffffffffh  esi => 97fh edi => byte ptr [esp+13ah]&0ffffffffh  The VM’s context is stored on the stack and no values are passed by registers  between handlers; that means all register modifi cation can be dropped to get  a clearer view:  dword ptr [esp+10h] => 1ch*byte ptr [esp+136h]+dword ptr [esp+10h]+5c8h  dword ptr [esp+14h] => dword ptr [esp+14h]-0ff0h  dword ptr [esp+18h] => dword ptr [esp+18h]+94eh  dword ptr [esp+58h] => -5ddh*byte ptr [esp+13ah]+97fh  dword ptr [esp+5ch] => 97fh  dword ptr [esp+60h] => -5ddh*byte ptr [esp+13ah]+97fh  dword ptr [esp+13ch] => ebp-5ddh*byte ptr [esp+13ah]+360h  We already know that the handler number is stored at [ESP+13Ch]. It is updated  by the handler. Its fi nal value depends on the value of byte ptr [ESP+13ah]. By  analyzing a few other handlers, we can guess it is a Boolean value, and a few  other Booleans are stored in the context. This one is stored in second position,  and it will be named flag2.  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 331   332   Chapter 5   Obfuscation  [ESP+58h], [ESP +5Ch], and [ESP +60h] are fi rmly tied with the handler  number computation. They respectively contain the delta between the old and  new handler number in case the condition  here flag2  is true or false.  [ESP +10h], [ESP +14h], and [ESP +18h] are also of high interest. They are  updated by almost every handler and are supposed to decrypt the bytecode:  They access the large undefi ned constants table stored in the .data section .  They are actually like a running key; they’ll be named respectively key_a,  key_b, and key_c.  The following is an example of key usage taken from handler 0xa0a at address   0x427b17:  nHandler => dword ptr [4*key_c+436010h]^              dword ptr [4*key_b+436010h]^              dword ptr [4*key_a+436010h]  The names can be injected within the handler’s binding, making it more under- standable  even if that’s not our main objective here  and easy to manipulate:  key_a => 1ch*flag6+key_a+5c8h  key_b => key_b-0ff0h  key_c => key_c+94eh  delta_true => -5ddh*flag2+97fh  delta_false => 97fh  delta => -5ddh*flag2+97fh  nHandler => ebp-5ddh*flag2+360h   This handler has almost the semantics of a conditional jump. By analyzing a  few other handlers, it is possible to recover and validate a mapping of the VM’s  symbolic variables, which will be represented by a hash object:  SYMBOLIC_VM = {     Indirection[Expression[ :esp, :+, 0x10], 4, nil] => :key_a,     Indirection[Expression[ :esp, :+, 0x14], 4, nil] => :key_b,     Indirection[Expression[ :esp, :+, 0x18], 4, nil] => :key_c,     Indirection[Expression[ :esp, :+, 0x58], 4, nil] => :delta,     Indirection[Expression[ :esp, :+, 0x5c], 4, nil] => :delta_false,     Indirection[Expression[ :esp, :+, 0x60], 4, nil] => :delta_true,     Indirection[Expression[ :esp, :+, 0x134], 1, nil] => :flag8,     Indirection[Expression[ :esp, :+, 0x135], 1, nil] => :flag7,     Indirection[Expression[ :esp, :+, 0x136], 1, nil] => :flag6,     Indirection[Expression[ :esp, :+, 0x137], 1, nil] => :flag5,     Indirection[Expression[ :esp, :+, 0x138], 1, nil] => :flag4,     Indirection[Expression[ :esp, :+, 0x139], 1, nil] => :flag3,     Indirection[Expression[ :esp, :+, 0x13a], 1, nil] => :flag2,     Indirection[Expression[ :esp, :+, 0x13b], 1, nil] => :flag1,     Indirection[Expression[ :esp, :+, 0x13c], 4, nil] => :nHandler }  Other memory locations do not seem to have a dedicated purpose; they can  be considered mapped as general-purpose registers. With this mapping, we   c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 332      Chapter 5   Obfuscation   333  have all we need to process a symbolic execution of the VM  i.e., step-by-step  execution of handler’s semantics .  Symbolic Execution In order to process a symbolic execution, you must have some clues about the  initialization context of the VM; recall the initial value of the turning key or the  value of the program counter  handler number . In our case, calls to the VM are  themselves obfuscated  remember the previously discussed graph-fl attened func- tions , making the initialization context quite hard to recover statically. In that  situation, one can simply take the best of the two worlds and use a compromise  between static and dynamic analysis, sometimes referred to as concolic execution. Basically that means you debug the target and catch  break at  every call to  the VM; within the callback, you switch from dynamic to static analysis and  proceed to the following actions:   1.  Dump target’s memory.   2.  Initialize the symbolic analysis context with the memory dump. Actually,  a kind of lazy loading can be used. All access to the uninitialized context  will be solved and cached using the memory dump.    3.  Compute the VM’s symbolic execution.  Using concolic execution, it becomes quite easy to follow the execution fl ow  of the VM  i.e., a succession of handlers . The process of handler analysis and  tracing is fully automated.  Here is an example of output of the tool for one handler. The extensive use of  the turning key  consisting of key_a, key_b, and key_c  clearly appears; in this  situation, the key is used to obfuscate access to the VM’s context:  [+] disasm handler 2be at 42c2cdh [+] analyzing handler at 0x42c2cd [+] considering code from 0x42c2cd to 0x42c3b3 [+] cached handler binding  dword ptr [dword ptr [esp+4* dword ptr [4*key_b+436000h]^    dword ptr [4*key_c+436000h]^dword ptr [4*key_a+436000h]  +140h]] =>   dword ptr [dword ptr [esp+4* dword ptr [4*key_b+436004h]^    dword ptr [4*key_c+436004h]^dword ptr [4*key_a+436004h]  +140h]]  key_c => key_c+5  key_b => key_b+5  key_a => key_a+5  nHandler =>  dword ptr [4*key_b+43600ch]^    dword ptr [4*key_c+43600ch]^dword ptr [4*key_a+43600ch]  +      dword ptr [4*key_c+436010h]^ dword ptr [4*key_b+436010h]^   dword ptr [4*key_a+436010h]  * byte ptr [dword ptr [esp+4*  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 333   334   Chapter 5   Obfuscation     dword ptr [4*key_b+436008h]^ dword ptr [4*key_c+436008h]^   dword ptr [4*key_a+436008h]  +140h]]&0ffh  &0ffffffffh   [+] symbolic binding  dword ptr [esp+0a8h] => dword ptr [esp+0ach]  key_c => 0d6h  key_b => 1f6h  key_a => 126ah  nHandler =>   21eh* flag4&0ffh  &0ffffffffh +0ac6h  [+] solved binding dword ptr [esp+0a8h] => 4f3de0b9h  key_c => 0d6h  key_b => 1f6h  key_a => 126ah n Handler => 0ac6h  Solving the Challenge What we have designed so far is equivalent to a VM’s level-tracing tool. Handling  branching statements— un conditional jumps, calls—would be required to get  a disassembling-oriented tool. We could build a more complex tool, a sort of  compiler, based on a bytecode disassembler and be able to regenerate native  code. Using a previous example, the tool would process the input:   dword ptr [ESP+0a8h] => dword ptr [ESP+0ach]   to a C-like source:  vm_ctx.reg_2ah = vm_ctx.reg_2bh;  For this sample, we will rely on the tracing feature only. The strategy is  straightforward. We have a good idea of the algorithm implemented by the VM,  so we will use black-box differential analysis to identify divergence between a  standard Mersenne twister  MT  algorithm and the VM’s. When a divergence  is identifi ed, we will check the trace output.  Let’s again take an example to illustrate this: state initialization of the MT  algorithm. The initialization is implemented by function func2. We will only  look at its inputs outputs. The state is an array of 624 dwords. Using standard  implementations and the same seed used by the program for a name of six  characters,  3961821h , we get the following:     Standard implementation—state[1] = 0x968bff6d    VM’s implementation—state[1] = 0x968e4c84  We look for these values in the trace:  [+] disasm handler 2c2 at 41f056h [+] analyzing handler at 0x41f056 [+] considering code from 0x41f056 to 0x41f165  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 334      Chapter 5   Obfuscation   335  [+] cached handler binding  byte ptr [esp+0dh] => byte ptr [dword ptr [esp+4* dword ptr   [4*key_b+43600ch]^ dword ptr [4*key_c+43600ch]^dword ptr   [4*key_a+43600ch]  +140h]]&0ffh dword ptr [dword ptr [esp+4* dword ptr [4*key_b+436000h]^ dword ptr   [4*key_c+436000h]^dword ptr [4*key_a+436000h]  +140h]] => dword ptr [dword  ptr   [esp+4* dword ptr [4*key_b+436004h]^ dword ptr [4*key_c+436004h]^dword ptr   [4*key_a+436004h]  +140h]]^dword ptr [dword ptr [esp+4* dword ptr   [4*key_b+436008h]^ dword ptr [4*key_c+436008h]^dword ptr   [4*key_a+436008h]  +140h]]  key_c => key_c+6  key_a => key_a+6  key_b => key_b+6  nHandler =>  dword ptr [4*key_b+436010h]^ dword ptr [4*key_c+436010h]^dword  ptr   [4*key_a+436010h]  +   dword ptr [4*key_c+436014h]^ dword ptr   [4*key_b+436014h]^dword ptr [4*key_a+436014h]  * byte ptr [dword ptr   [esp+4* dword ptr [4*key_b+43600ch]^ dword ptr [4*key_c+43600ch]^dword ptr   [4*key_a+43600ch]  +140h]]&0ffh  &0ffffffffh   [+] symbolic binding byte ptr [esp+0dh] => flag2&0ffh  dword ptr [esp+100h] => dword ptr [esp+9ch]^dword ptr [esp+10ch]  key_c => 10e2h  key_a => 12b3h  key_b => 0c8ah  nHandler =>   164h* flag2&0ffh  &0ffffffffh +0a53h  [+] solved binding byte ptr [esp+0dh] => 1  dword ptr [esp+100h] => 968e4c84h  key_c => 10e2h  key_a => 12b3h  key_b => 0c8ah  [+] context dump [...]  dword ptr [esp+9ch] => 968bff6dh  dword ptr [esp+10ch] => 5b3e9h [...]  We have a XOR operation between dword ptr [ESP+9ch] and dword ptr   [ESP+10ch]. We can check from the context their values:  This handler has a XOR-like semantics and is included within one of the loops  previously identifi ed  one with 624 iterations, the size of the MT state . There  are a few more steps to recover the full transformation, but this approach is  suffi cient. Its pseudo-code would be as follows:  scramble = 0x5b3e9h for i in  N-1    state[i+1] ^= scramble  c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 335   336   Chapter 5   Obfuscation    scramble = lcg_rand scramble   with N being the size of the state: 624. lcg_rand is a linear congruential generator  ≡  axn + c   mod m , with a, c, and m respectively equal to 0x159b, 0x13e8b,  xn+1  and 0xffffffff.  The rest of the Mersenne twister algorithm is also lightly modifi ed; each of  these tweaks involves the fi rst letter of the username and a simple operation  ADD SUB XOR. We will not say more about these tweaks; please refer to the fol- lowing “Exercises” section.     Username—”Hell yeah, we have tools!”    Serial number—”117538a51905ddf6”  Final Thoughts That sample is a great playground, nicely crafted by its author. We have used an  interesting combination of dynamic and static analysis to work through it. The  protection implements code-fl attening, code virtualization, and data encoding,  concepts that can be found in most professional-grade protection systems, and  yet it is still accessible. It provides a useful template for sharpening tools and  experimenting with new ideas and or algorithms. The simplicity of the protection  scheme and the algorithm enabled us to take many shortcuts for this section.  Exercises  The fi rst exercise we propose to you is to keygen this chapter’s case study binary.  This is a great starting point:     The binary is unique, relatively small, and easy to analyze, disassemble,  and instrument. Thus, this is an accessible challenge even for beginners.    Most of the important implemented techniques have been described in the  case study. Look for them and ensure that you understand their internals.  After reading this chapter, getting your own hands on the challenge would   be an invaluable experience. Your task is as follows:   1.  Based on the proposed methodology  or one you come up with , build   your own tool to analyze the VM’s bytecode.    2.  Contact your favorite demo division and package a stunning keygen for   this fi ne crackme.  To familiarize yourself with Metasm, you’ll fi nd two exercise scripts with the  material shipped with the book: symbolic-execution-lvl1.rb and symbolic- execution-lvl2.rb. Answering the questions will lead you to a journey in   c05.indd  01:30:20:PM  01 20 2014  Page 336               Metasm internals.

Reverse engineering is the process of analyzing hardware or software and understanding it, without having access to the source code or design documents. Hackers are able to reverse engineer systems and exploit what they find with scary results. Now the good guys can use the same tools to thwart these threats. Practical Reverse Engineering goes under the hood of reverse engineering for security analysts, security engineers, and system programmers, so they can learn how to use these same processes to stop hackers in their tracks.
The book covers x86, x64, and ARM (the first book to cover all three); Windows kernel-mode code rootkits and drivers; virtual machine protection techniques; and much more.
