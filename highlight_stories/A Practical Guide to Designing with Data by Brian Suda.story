We first met through  the microformats community, where he uses his skills to make  structured data readily available and easily understandable.   Now he is applying those skills to the world of data.  I am covetous of Brianʼs mind. It is the mind of a scientist,   constantly asking questions: “What was the first man-made object  with a unique identifier?”, “What would a hypercube of bread  classification look like?”, “What would it sound like to say all fifty  of the United States at the same time?”  Okay, that last one was from Family Guy. But whereas you or I  would be content to laugh at the joke and move on, Brian actually  tried it by layering fifty audio recordings on top of one another.  For the record, it sounds like this: Mwashomomakota.  As you would expect from such an enquiring mind, this book  is not a shallow overview of graphs and charts. If you are looking  for a quick fix on how to make your PowerPoint presentations pop,  this isnʼt the book for you. But if you want to understand what  happens when the human brain interacts with representations of  data, you have hit the motherlode.  It isnʼt hyperbole to say that this book will change the way   you look at the world. In the same way that typography geeks canʼt  help but notice the good and bad points of lettering in everyday  life, youʼre going to start spotting data design all around you. Better still, you are going to learn how to apply that deep   knowledge to your own work. You will begin asking questions   of yourself: “Am I communicating data honestly and effectively?”,  “What is the cognitive overhead of the information I am  presenting?”  Your mind will be more Suda-like once you have read this  book. The phrase “change your mind” is usually used to mean  “reverse a decision”. I want to use the phrase in a different, more  literal way.  This book will change your mind.   iv   v  A Practical Guide to Designing with Data  Introduction  Over the years, I have been digging through large data sets both for  work and pleasure. I love numbers, charts, graphs, visualizations,  zeitgeists, raumzeitgeists, infographics and old maps. Getting to  peek into what companies like Google get to see on a daily basis  – trends, fads, search volume, relatedness, all bundled up in an  interesting illustration – makes my day. Some people re-read the  same book over and over; I can stare at a dense illustration and  re-read its story. It makes me ask, “What caused these numbers?  Where did they all come from?” It has been estimated that the  Large Hadron Collider produces fifteen petabytes  fifteen million  gigabytes  of data a year. Itʼs impossible to look at a table of  fifteen petabytes of information – there has to be a graphical  representation for anyone to comprehend data at this volume. This is what excites me: the challenge of how to take these   boring numbers and design something more compelling. To tell  the story behind the data, we need to stop grasping for the perfect  visualization and instead return to the basic language of charts  and graphs. Only then can we begin to uncover the meaning and  relationships the data has to offer.  Beyond the basic bar charts and line graphs taught in   schools, a new breed of illustrations has recently appeared. These  new ʻvisualizationsʼ are an attempt to explain the underlying  information with a powerful visual impact. They take complex  ideas and distil them into beautiful graphics revealing the  interrelationships in the data. Some are so brilliantly executed  that there are now annual awards for newspaper and magazine  infographics to highlight their achievements. Sadly, over recent  years terms such as visualization and infographic have been  bandied around with almost no regard to their proper use or  meaning. Existing chart types and even slide shows have been  saddled with the more gratuitous term ʻinfographsʼ to sound  more impressive. There is a new vernacular in the realm of data  representation, but that doesnʼt mean we should ignore the  underlying principles and best practices of humble charts and  graphs. Once you have mastered the basics, more complex designs  and visualizations become easier to create.   vi  I wrote this book because I feel that people arenʼt taking the  fundamentals of graphs and charts seriously. Many people are  inspired by fancy visualizations and jump right in over their heads.  As with any discipline, you need to put in the hard work by starting  from the beginning.  If you look at publishersʼ catalogues, there are plenty of books   on this topic, but they all cover somewhat esoteric aspects of  specific charts and graphs: either from an academic point of view,  stating how to right align numeric values or calculate confidence  intervals to two standard deviations; or illustrated guides to  beautiful posters and the information they represent. While these  topics are certainly important, you need to consider the dataʼs  context and the readers who are looking to your charts and graphs  for answers. Having a beautiful poster or a well documented  confidence interval is worthless if the rest of the design is  unreadable. I wrote this book in an attempt to distil as much  knowledge as possible into just the information you will need  day-to-day. There are plenty of specific kinds of charts for very  specialized fields, from financial to weather data and everything  in between, but they all require a fundamental understanding of  the basics. Just because someone might be an expert in their field  doesnʼt mean that they have the know-how to design with data.   This book is a peek into the pinball machine of my mind,   always bouncing around various related and sometimes unrelated  topics. I wanted to draw together several techniques you can use  in your charts and graphs, such as how to minimize the number  of pixels, and at the same time explain some interesting aspects of  colour in our lives. In addition, I felt it was important to explain  how to spot bad or misleading design: the kind that unscrupulous  people use to trick us into believing their interpretation of data  rather than the facts. Only then can you properly focus on the data,  bypass unnecessary distractions and avoid misrepresenting the  information.   vii  A Practical Guide to Designing with Data  The main purpose of this book is to encourage you to visualize  and design for data in such a way that it engages the reader and  tells a story rather than just being flashy, cluttered and confusing.  Much like authors choose their words, sentences and paragraphs  to structure ideas, informaticians have a bevy of concepts at their  disposal to tell stories with data. What I want to focus on are best  practices. These pages donʼt describe the one true way to design  with data, but set out some guiding principles you can have at  your disposal when you sit down and illustrate data.  The Five Simple Steps team has been great during this whole   process. They let me write the book I wanted to write and were  incredibly patient with my digressions. I hope that some of them  help explain my thought processes as well as entertain with  some interesting tidbits now and then. The five in Five Simple  Steps is a great constraint for a writer, but it does mean that this  is hardly a complete list of types of graphs and charts. New ideas  and concepts are always appearing, some good, some bad. Instead  of following an endless trail, this is an overview of the common  types youʼll run into on a regular basis and how to push them to  get the maximum value.  The title Designing with data was chosen because I wanted   to focus not on data collection, statistics or other mathematical  analysis, but rather on the visualization of data. Much like you  create a narrative in words, illustrations of data need to tell a story.  How you go about designing with data is just about as open as how  to write a book. The one thing we do know is that it is important  to get the basics right. This book is an introduction to those basics  and an invitation to you to become the next expert data designer.    viii                              Contents              Part 1  The visual language of data Graph Genesis  Chart literaCy  DynamiC anD statiC Charts  Does this make me look fat?

We all know the emotional power  of a good book. The words on paper allow you to get sucked into  the characters and plot. Classic paintings do the same. Millions of  people go to see the Mona Lisa every year. Her eyes, her smile tell us  a mysterious story. Who is she? The oil painting draws us into another  world that we are welcome to explore. An effective illustration must do  the same.    This book is about designing with data. Charts, graphs and other   data visualizations have a language of their own. They convey meaning  and information that is not available in words while demonstrating  relationships within the data, and they allow the reader to make  projections and better grasp the concepts. We need to learn how to  tell a story with data and how to design it in such a way that it is no  different than a great work of art or a bedtime story you remember  from childhood. Well designed data should provoke emotions, tell a  story, draw the reader in and let them explore.

Chart junk     3  1              A Practical Guide to Designing with Data  ~ Graph genesis  Graph genesis   Some of the objects we use in our daily lives are so ubiquitous that  we assume they have been around for all time. Even something  as simple as the humble directional arrow, pointing the way and  giving us instructions, once didnʼt exist. It was ʻinventedʼ for its  modern day use. The barcode is a very modern invention  first  conceived in the late 1940s but not widely used until the 1970s ,  yet we see it everywhere. One day, children will never have known  a world without e-mail, the Internet or 3-D projection televisions.  In this book, I address the common types of charts and   graphs, discuss some uncommon types and the reasons why they  should stay that way. Itʼs also important to look back at how many  of these creations started off. As weʼll see, they werenʼt so different  than the charts we use today – two hundred years on and not  much has changed. It makes you wonder, were charts and graphs  invented or simply discovered? Were they destined to arrive in the  form they did or are they so useful and near-perfect that we have  just stuck with them?    Believe it or not, there once was a time before graphs and   charts – they too were invented. The ancient Egyptians didnʼt have  PowerPoint® presentations or pie charts  probably they also lived  in blissful ignorance of a world of bulleted lists . Socrates taught  his followers without the use of bar charts or Venn diagrams.  Even the Romans didnʼt use graphs to visualize their luxurious  spending sprees over the years, or miles of new roads constructed  throughout the empire. Yet we assume that we canʼt live without  three-dimensional quarterly projections from Excel®.    If we look back to the time when some of the very first charts   were created, weʼll see that they were born out of the need to  explain large amounts of financial, political and social data.    It wasnʼt until William Playfair  1759–1823 , a Scottish engineer and  political economist, published The Commercial and Political Atlas  in 1786 and Statistical Breviary in 1801 that many of our modern  visual devices for data first saw the light of day. He is credited   with inventing the bar chart, line chart, pie chart and circle graph   see part 4 .     4  Though Playfair gets most of the credit for kicking off this  revolution, there are several other notable contributors who  developed the tools we use today. You might know Joseph Priestley  as ʻthe inventor of airʼ. Priestley was born in 1733 in England where  he spent his life until 1791, when he fled persecution to the newly  established USA. In 1765, he published A Chart of Biography which  outlined the years of births and deaths of “statesmen of learning”.  This is one of the first timelines showing relative length and  durations as a chart rather than as a table.  About twenty years after Priestley, in 1786, William Playfair  published some of the first extant  visual charts and graphs in  his books about economics. Priestleyʼs timeline certainly had  an effect on Playfair as he created the bar charts. It is likely that  William Playfair was aware of Priestley through various channels:  the publication of Priestleyʼs papers and books, almost certainly,  but possibly also through the University of Edinburgh, which  conferred the degree of Doctor of Law on Priestley in 1764. The  Playfair family designed some of the most notable buildings of  Edinburgh and its university, along with being deeply involved in  the Enlightenment movement, as was Priestley.  Another contribution to the visualization of large sets of data   came from Charles Dupin  1784–1873 , a French mathematician  and engineer. His contribution to the advancement of charts was    5  A Practical Guide to Designing with Data  ~ Graph genesis  the choropleth map, first published in 1826. A choropleth map   sometimes called a cartogram – see chapter 21  is a diagrammatic  map whose regions are variously coloured or shaded to illustrate a  particular statistic, such as population density or voting choices.  The first choropleth map designed by Dupin illustrated the  illiteracy rate in Franceʼs regions.    A few years later, André-Michel Guerry  1802–1866  took   Dupinʼs idea and began to build, embrace and extend. In 1833, he  published his Essay on moral statistics of France which presented  suicide and crime statistics in France on maps. The statistics were  broken down and the maps coloured by just about every variable  available. Guerry was fascinated by these charts and their social  and economic impacts. He was the first to work in this field which  later became known as moral statistics.    In 1854, a cholera epidemic swept through the city of London   killing thousands of people every day. The health inspectors at  the time believed that cholera was transmitted by infected air, but  physician John Snow  1813–1858  believed that the outbreak was  not airborne, but passed through the water supply. Using a map,  he went door-to-door asking local residents about cholera deaths  and marked each location to show the outbreak density. Using this  data he traced the source of contamination to a local water pump  and ordered the pumpʼs handle removed, thereby preventing  further spread of the disease in the neighbourhood. His map  wasnʼt exactly a choropleth and it wasnʼt exactly a bar chart either.  He mixed two chart methods to form a different kind of early  visualization. Using geographically specific data, he concluded  that the density of cases could be attributed to a local pump,  strengthening his waterborne argument.   6  The next big advance in designing with data comes from Florence  Nightingale  1820–1910 . In 1858, while working as a nurse during  the Crimean War, she emphasized the sanitary conditions in which  the wounded patients were being treated. And there being multiple  reasons why soldiers die while in hospital, she invented the polar  area chart  see chapter 22 , based on William Playfairʼs earlier pie  charts from 1801. Her polar chart was a circular diagram of causes  of death due to disease, wounds and preventable ailments. This  illustrated the volume of lives that could have been saved given  proper sanitary conditions: an early instance of hard statistical  evidence being used to support changes in medical decisions and  procedure.    In that same year, a French civil engineer named   Charles Joseph Minard  1781–1870  pushed the boundaries of  visualizations. He mixed multiple types of charts to convey more  data and relationships. Taking a map of France, he overlaid several    7  A Practical Guide to Designing with Data  ~ Graph genesis  pie charts to show the geographic positions of the data sets. A few  years later in 1869, he published his now famous chart depicting  Napoleonʼs march into Russia. This has been hailed as one of the  greatest landmark works in data visualization history. It is a flow  graph which uses a map to show the relative transfers of goods  and people, geographic positions over time and several other  related pieces of data such as temperature and troop size.  Within the last ten to twenty years, several new forms of charts  have appeared. I attribute some of these to recent advances  and innovations, but itʼs more likely that new charts and graph  types are always being invented. Sometimes their usefulness is  minimal and they disappear and no one remembers them. Only  the recent developments that have not yet been proven useful or a  burden seem innovative to us. Some of these new designs, such as  treemaps  see chapter 18 , will be discussed in this book because  it is important to know their strengths and weaknesses before you  jump in and use them in your own work.   8   A Practical Guide to Designing with Data  ~ Chart literacy  Chart literacy   The amount of information rendered in a single financial graph  is easily equivalent to thousands of words of text or a page-sized  table of raw values. A graph illustrates so many characteristics of  data in a much smaller space than any other means. Charts also  allow us to tell a story in a quick and easy way that words cannot.   Graphs and charts are appearing more and more in our   popular culture. Sites like Graph Jam1 and Indexed2 take concepts,  song lyrics, observations and allegories and render them in rather  silly or humorous pie and bar charts.    9  2              http:  www.graphjam.com  We immediately understand them and they tell a story in their  own right, sometimes more so than the original data. The fact that  they give another dimension and life to the data demonstrates  their worth.    Much of the value of graphs and charts comes from their   clear, usable, legible interface whether on paper, screen or other  medium. But graphs alone do not make something that is long,  difficult and tedious instantly useful. It takes skill to be able to  make a chart exciting and engaging without obscuring the facts.    1    graphjam.com 2    thisisindexed.com   10  Florence Nightingale used charts to improve the conditions  for hospital patients and in the process saved countless lives.  John Snowʼs cholera map transformed a table of dry names and  addresses into a heat map of the affected areas. Both of these  visualizations were clear and concise, and resulted in changes  which benefited humanity. Had these been descriptions or raw  values they would have been less likely to carry the weight that  they had.    Thatʼs not to say that there arenʼt poorly designed charts    or graphs that are useful. But this book offers five simple steps   to creating effective charts and graphs by describing the   situations where each chart type performs best and which to   avoid completely.    And this is just the start of the journey: a well designed chart  only gets you so far. Good graphic design is not a panacea for bad  copy, poor layout or misleading statistics. If any one of these facets  are feebly executed it reflects poorly on the work overall, and this  includes bad graphs and charts.    Humans have been writing for thousands of years. The   personal computer started the desktop publishing boom we have  today  ten thousand fonts and all , and it was only very recently  that charts and graphs became so easy to create, yet so often  missing the mark.  With further explanations of the techniques of good design,  we can improve the outlook for everyone, make the data clearer  and tell a better story.  This book focuses on taking data and putting it into charts  and graphs. Everything here is applicable to a fairly new term:  ʻvisualizationsʼ. It is a sort of empty word, simply meaning  ʻpretty pictures with statistical valuesʼ. I feel that, unfortunately,  visualizations has become a buzzword. Several websites now list  “the top 10 cool visualizations”, or the “35 best visualizations of   the year”.    So what is the difference between a chart or graph and a   visualization? My distinction is, perhaps, an arbitrary one and  others will have different definitions, but a chart or graph is a clean  and simple atomic piece; bar charts contain a short story about the    11  A Practical Guide to Designing with Data  data being presented. A visualization, on the other hand, seems to  contain much more ʻchart junkʼ, with many sometimes complex  graphics or several layers of charts and graphs. A visualization  seems to be the super-set for all sorts of data-driven design.  The fact that visualization has entered the vernacular reveals its  growing popularity, even though no one seems to know exactly  what it means.  Another indication of the importance of good chart design is  the emergence of multiple awards, ceremonies and organizations  championing and measuring chart design.  All in all, chart literacy  is an important tool, both for people creating the design to convey  the message and for readers to understand the dataʼs story.   12   13  3  A Practical Guide to Designing with Data  ~ Dynamic and static charts  Dynamic and static charts   With the invention of the personal computer came a much more  interactive medium through which to view charts and adjust data  values. In the past, charts and graphs were printed on paper and  were as static as the medium. Both dynamic and static charts have  their advantages and disadvantages. In this book, I will mostly  address static charts and graphs, but the same concepts apply to  interactive ones. Just because your design is interactive doesnʼt  mean that you can throw away everything youʼve learnt about  static chart design.   Interactive charts The most common dynamic chart you are aware of is the weather  map. When meteorologists give the five-day forecast and an  animated storm front sweeps across the screen, this is a dynamic  chart. Itʼs displaying thousands of data points of storm intensity  mapped on to latitude and longitude. When animated, it shows  these values over time in a very complex way. It actually consists  of several static charts rendered and animated to be played  backwards and forwards. An animation saves a lot of space when  compared with a printout of pages and pages of similar data. The  downside is that only media that can play animations can use it.    That said, dynamic graphs arenʼt just animations. They can  be designed to be interactive so that you can select only certain  regions of the chart, or turn values on and off to remove clutter or  focus on a subset of the items being tracked.   14  A well designed interactive chart allows the reader to manipulate  the presentation of the data. A reader can zoom in to get a closer,  fine-grained look, and zoom out to get an overview. Interactive  graphs can isolate just a few aspects of the data and track them  over time, possibly by adding a trail to the data to see where it has  been in the past compared to the present.    For instance, in a financial line chart for all of the top 500  companies on the stock market, it should be possible to limit  the data to those companies in which the reader owns shares.  By making the chart interactive, you can reduce all the possible  permutations that would need to be displayed so that the reader  can have a chart of just the information required.    With animations, it might be useful to compare two non- sequential frames or leave a ghost trail. As the weather map  follows the hurricane across the Atlantic, it could leave a small  trail showing the path from start to finish. Many characteristics of  data that are difficult or impossible to show in a static chart can be  visualized using animation.    No matter if the chart is dynamic or static, the concepts in   this book apply to both. The idea that the principles involved  in selecting appropriate colours, chart types or white space are  different for dynamic and static charts is incorrect.     15  A Practical Guide to Designing with Data  ~ Dynamic and static charts  My greatest concern about dynamic and interactive graphs is  not how badly they can be designed, but about their longevity.  We can look at the earliest extant charts and graphs from over  two hundred years ago because they were encoded in an analog  format; they were etched into metal plates and printed with ink  onto paper. They were reproduced in several different books,  magazines, newspapers and periodicals; no single source had the  only copy of the design.    As we design fancy Flash® animations, MPEG videos, SMIL   animations and use other proprietary formats that reside only on  our one, fragile server, do we consider whether the files can be  opened in two hundred yearsʼ time? The first computer-animated  graph is probably already lost to us because it was rendered in  a format now obsolete. This isnʼt a problem of lost back-ups or  misplaced files, it is a genuine issue for forward-thinking design.  Animations are difficult in an analog world, but not   impossible: an orrery is a mechanical model of our solar system.  As the clockwork gears are wound, the planets move in relation  to one another. Such a system doesnʼt suffer from file format  incompatibility two hundred years after it was made. Can the  same be said about some of the content that you are producing on  a daily basis?  Dynamic graphs are excellent tools for exploring data, but if   they canʼt be printed out or cast in metal, they wonʼt last.  Static charts Much of this book addresses static charts and graphs. I want to  bring your attention to some of the benefits of them being static.   Analog formats last a long time. The Rosetta stone has an   analog format: text cut into stone. It is several thousand years old  and it works. The new Rosetta Project1 , which aims to record all  the worldʼs languages, has an online archive, but the data collected  is also available on a micro-etched nickel alloy disc that can be  read using a microscope. Static, analog formats such as paper   1     http:  rosettaproject.org   16  printouts, bound books and metal plates last much longer than  digital files with specific encodings, file formats and digital rights  management.  Thatʼs not to mention the versatility of static charts. When not   constrained by animation, charts, graphs and visualizations can  end up in the oddest of places. From newspapers and printouts, to  statues and architecture.  Since there is no need for any mechanical or moving parts,   static works can more easily be reproduced and shared in several  different media, thereby reaching a much wider audience. This  isnʼt to belittle interactive design, but it is a point to consider  next time you get excited at the prospect of animating a chart just  because you can.    17  4  A Practical Guide to Designing with Data  ~ Does this make me look fat?  Does this make me look fat?   When designing any sort of visualization, you need to know how  much space to allocate to the layout; this will determine your  chartʼs dimensions. Depending on the content and type of your  chart, the size will vary. Pie charts, radar plots and other circular  charts need to be symmetrical, but others can be rectangular. Then there are the qualities inherent to web and print.    They are two very different media. On the web we can set text and  container sizes as percentages relative to the browser window,  whereas in print the paper has fixed dimensions. Each mediumʼs  strengths and weaknesses, as well as layout constraints, make  designing charts for each medium different.  There is no correct answer as to what proportions are best, but  here are a few pleasing suggestions and some details as to how our  culture arrived at these dimensions.   Golden ratio   Phi or, as it is more commonly known, the golden ratio, has been  a popular design tool for around 2,500 years. The ancient Greeks  used this ratio in the construction of ideal buildings and statues.  Notre Dame in Paris also has aspects of the golden ratio in its  construction.  http:  www.flickr.com photos bruchez 400273223    18  The golden ratio is a specific ratio between two lines of unequal  length. The ratio is golden when you get the same value dividing  the smaller into the larger as you do when you divide the larger  into the sum of both.  The equation is: a b =  a+b  a  a  1.0  b  a 1.0  1.618033988  b  .618033988  This yields an irrational number. An irrational number is one that  cannot be represented as a fraction of whole numbers. The golden  ratio is often expressed as the value 1.618, but it is actually infinite.  In ordinary use, this means that for every single unit of height, you  need 1.618 units of width.  1  1.61803399  If mathematics isnʼt your thing and you have trouble  remembering the decimal value of the golden ratio, there is a more  straightforward system called the Fibonacci sequence.    19  A Practical Guide to Designing with Data  ~ Does this make me look fat?              Fibonacci sequence   Leonardo Pisano Bogollo  called Fibonacci after his father,  Guglielmo Fibonacci  was an Italian mathematician who lived in  in the late 1100s to early 1200s. He helped spread the use of the  Arabic numeral system in Europe, the system we still use today.  His other major contribution was his Book of Calculation  Liber  Abaci  in which he discussed the Fibonacci sequence. He didnʼt  invent the system, but popularized it such that it was named after  him. The sequence has plenty of interesting uses in mathematics,  but in this chapter weʼre interested only in the ratios.  The sequence of Fibonacci numbers is: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ... and it continues infinitely. The  sequence is built by starting with 1 and adding 1 to it, giving the  result 2. We then take that answer and add it to the previous value,  in this case 1. 1 + 2 = 3. The process is repeated so that 2 + 3 = 5, 3 +  5 = 8 and so on:  The sequence isnʼt intrinsically interesting, but itʼs easy to  remember. The useful part begins when you divide one Fibonacci  number by the preceding Fibonacci number. Doing so results in an  approximation of the golden ratio  1.618 .  1 + 1 = 2  1 + 2 = 3 2 + 3 = 5 3 + 5 = 8 5 + 8 = 13 8 + 13 = 21 13 + 21 = 34  1∕1 = 1 2∕1 = 2 3∕2 = 1.5 5∕3 = 1.666 8∕5 = 1.6 13∕8 = 1.625 21∕13 = 1.615   20  As the series continues the results get closer and closer to the  precise value of the golden ratio. If you are looking for a nice  rectangular ratio for your charts then select any multiples of two  consecutive values in the sequence: 210 pixels by 130 pixels, 890  pixels by 550 pixels, and so on.  The golden ratio is similar to other common aspect ratios  we see every day. The ratio 3:2 is used in 135 film cameras. The  standard 35mm silver halide emulsion film is 36mm × 24mm. 3:2 is  easy to remember and is close to the golden ratio.  Before widescreen  16:9  became popular, movies, computer   monitors and television screens had a ratio of 4:3, which is  somewhere between 3:2 and 5:3, but also gives pleasing results.  Using the Fibonacci sequence to derive a ratio is just one way   to determine ʻidealʼ dimensions, but there are plenty of other  equally valid, if perhaps arbitrary, choices.   ISO A series paper   A4 paper has an interesting ratio of 1:√2 which is approximately  1.414. For each single vertical unit there are 1.414 horizontal units.  An A0 sheet of paper has an area of one metre squared and each  subsequent size has half the area. So A1 is half as big as A0, A2 half  of A1, smaller and smaller each time, while retaining the same  proportions.  1  1.41428571429  The advantage to the A series is that if you double the size of an A4  sheet, it fits exactly into an A3; if you have an A5 page, two will fit  precisely side-by-side in an A4. All the ratios are perfectly tucked  inside the next A series page.   21  A Practical Guide to Designing with Data  ~ Does this make me look fat?  This nesting makes for a convenient ratio when rotating, because  the scaled version always splits the previous in half. From an A0  sheet of paper, all other sizes can be cut without waste.   Nesting A series paper  16:9 Widescreen   The 16:9 ratio has been picked up as the widescreen format for  movies and TV. It also has a ratio close to the golden ratio: 1:1.777  makes it slightly wider than 1.618 but still within the same general  area and dimensions.  9  16  As more and more TV screens and films move to this ratio   though many movies use other, even wider ratios like 1.85:1 and  2.39:1 , it might become more aesthetically pleasing in our culture.  With 16:9 becoming the de facto standard, it makes you wonder,  does art imitate life or life imitate art?    22  Silver ratio   If you have a golden ratio, then why not a silver, or even a bronze  ratio? The silver ratio is another irrational number, a number that  goes on and on, just like the golden ratio.  The silver ratio is calculated in a similar way to the golden  ratio. You need two lines, one longer than the other. First, take  the longer side, double its length and then add the shorter length.  Then divide that total by the longer length. If the result equals the  division of the short length by the long length, then you have a  silver ratio.  a∕b =  2a + b ∕a  It all sounds quite complicated, but the final result is 1 + √2, which  gives a ratio of 1:2.414. For every single vertical unit there are 2.414  horizontal units. This makes a very wide  or tall  rectangle, even  more so than 16:9.  There are several ways to arrive at a silver ratio. The easiest   is to take a standard A4 piece of paper and remove the largest  possible square from it. This has made its proportions a common  size for compliment slips.  a  b  A4 size  What is left is a rectangle that is 1:2.414 in ratio. Now you can see  the long and skinny aspect of the silver ratio.   23  A Practical Guide to Designing with Data  ~ Does this make me look fat?  Egyptian pyramids   The Greeks werenʼt the only ones with an ideal ratio. Before them,  the Egyptians experimented with finding harmonies between  two lengths. There is a great debate about whether the Egyptian  pyramid builders used the mathematical concept of π  pi, 3.142   deliberately or that pi appeared naturally due to the use of wheels  in construction. The circumference of circles can be calculated  using pi  2πr . If an Egyptian builder paced out the length of a side  of a pyramid as forty-two revolutions of his wheel, that distance is  a multiple of pi. It is always possible, of course, that we have tried  too hard to make pi fit into Egyptian calculations retrospectively –  either that or it was aliens.  After the measurements of the Great Pyramid of Khufu    sometimes referred to as Cheops  were accurately determined,  some experts asserted that the Egyptians must have been aware of  pi. Before explaining what they based their claim on, we would do  well to remember that errors in data donʼt always originate with  the mathematics or visualizations, but instead at the source when  the original data was first recorded  more on that in chapter 8 .  How is it possible to measure exactly the sides of a stone structure  subject to 4,000 years of erosion? It isnʼt, but weʼll humour those  who made the effort.  If you double one side of the square base of the Great Pyramid  and divide it by the pyramidʼs height, the result, approximately, is  pi. There are plenty of conspiracy theories on why this is the case,  so it must be said that all the pyramids have different heights and  widths. The fact that the Great Pyramidʼs dimensions allow you to  calculate pi is almost certainly down to coincidence or particular  construction methods rather than a planned attempt at some  perfect ratio.   24  1  Nonetheless, the result of pi∕2 is 1.571, which is very similar to the  3:2 ratio we saw in the Fibonacci sequence and photographic film.   Other ratios   Anyone who studies vexillology  letʼs call them flag geeks  will  know that the height to width ratios of international flags read like  a number soup: 1:2, 3:4, 4:5, 6:7, 28:37, 21:40 and plenty of values in  between. This might just go to show that every country feels that  its flag deserves its own proportions – superior somehow to those  of other nations – or, more likely, that there is no single ratio that  is best for all designs.  Letʼs take all the ratios weʼve talked about so far and overlay   them to see what they have in common. Most fall into roughly the  same range.  All stacked together   A Practical Guide to Designing with Data  ~ Chart junk  25  5  Chart junk   In his 1983 book, The Visual Display of Quantitative Information,  Edward Tufte, an American statistician and information design  expert, referred to all the pointless illustrations that go along with  charts as junk. The definition of junk is wide and varied, but if  you remove something from the chart and it doesnʼt change the  meaning, itʼs chart junk.  We call it junk because it obscures the true meaning and   intention of the graph, which is to convey information and tell a  story. Any extraneous imagery is not part of the information. It  uses up valuable pixels and takes short-term memory resources  away from the data and draws the eye to the pretty pictures  instead.  One example of chart junk is the use of imagery to form the  bars in bar charts. Even companies that should know better give  you the option to upload an image and use it in the chart.  If you need to represent kilometres of railway track laid each year,  then you might choose to draw a bar chart of the count. There is no  need to style the bar chart to make the bars look like railway tracks  or train carriages. At best itʼs cute; at worst itʼs unprofessional  chart junk.  Chart junk isnʼt just misconceived graphics. It can be any  unnecessary visual clutter. Adding pointless information and  embellishments lessens the chartʼs ability to communicate.   26  Male  Female  Famous Social Network  52%  This chart uses the common gender icons to illustrate how  many more men or women visit particular websites. Can you  spot the problem?  This example was taken from a real-world  visualization.  Information is duplicated by the text value 52% and  the additional two female icons. The problem here is that there  should be four female icons. 100% − 52% is 48%: a difference of  four per cent. The icons are not only misleading and wrong, but  also unnecessary in this context.  When discussing gender differences, it is easy to slip into   using the male and female icons seen on bathroom doors. If you  find yourself doing this, ask yourself, “Can I delineate gender- related information without these icons? Is this chart junk?”  There are times when iconography is important. Gender icons  are well-established across cultural boundaries. If your charts are  to be produced in a local newspaper, text might suffice, but if the  chart will appear in an academic journal being read worldwide by  native speakers and non-native speakers, then icons could help  remove ambiguity.    27  A Practical Guide to Designing with Data  ~ Chart junk  Junk in the trunk   Chart junk isnʼt limited to the chart data. When you begin to over-  or underlay extra information like photos or graphs, it distracts  the eye. We rarely put large amounts of complex text on to photos,  so why put even more complex and dense data there instead?   Urban Growth              1920  1921  1922  1923  Keep your charts as free from clutter and open to white space as  possible. The information needs room to breathe; donʼt throw  more pointless data into the mix. The data to pixel ratio should be  as close as possible to one  see chapter 6 . Every pixel should be  doing its best to be data, and tangential photos and imagery are  designed to catch the eye rather than let the data tell a story.   28  Corporate branding   There is an old saying, “Do as I say, not as I do,” which I think  is apt here. Iʼll be honest and say that I donʼt always follow my  own advice. And neither should you. We know that chart junk is  certainly junk, yet we sometimes add it in anyway.  I am guilty of this sometimes when it comes to corporate   branding. After spending hours of work crafting a cleanly designed  chart to explain very complex issues and being proud of my hard  work, I then put a giant watermark over the entire chart, just so  no one can claim it as theirs. You will surely have to make similar  decisions about this at some point in time: protecting the work at  the expense of legibility.  Urban Growth  1920  1921  1922  1923  Some people are unscrupulous and will pass off anotherʼs hard  work as their own. A small logo in the margins of your chart might  get cropped out or erased, but a big watermark is hard to remove!  It is very tempting to do this and your client or boss might insist  on it. To me, a massive watermark over everything is rather like  peeing on it all to claim it as your own. It works, but there must be  a more elegant solution!   29  A Practical Guide to Designing with Data  ~ Chart junk  I also know that with computers the ability to mash up previously  unconnected data sets to produce interesting results is easier  than ever. In doing so, much of the layout is pre-built and the  data flows into it like water into a bucket. Sometimes the data is  messy, sometimes it isnʼt. Creating charts automatically with an  application leaves less room for design decisions, such as where  to place the logo. Because of this, on many occasions branding is  faded into the background and is as large as possible so no matter  the data, at least part of it can be seen. This might be a trade off  you are willing to accept: your readers puzzle over what is in the  background and you get the chance to have some branding visible  some of the time.  This is also a way for companies to re-sell their charting   software: your graph carries the manufacturerʼs brand unless you  pay the premium to remove it or replace it with your own.  Ultimately, a balance must be struck between protecting   the chart from plagiarists and not distracting or annoying your  readers. A fine line, indeed.   Summary  Now that we know the perils of bad design, weʼre going to dig into  the specifics of colour and ink. Getting the dimensions correct  is important, as is keeping the chart junk out, but how do you  achieve this? In part 2, weʼll get into the specifics of highlighting  specific portions of the design, how to use colour and ink to your  advantage and, more importantly, how to use them correctly.   Plus, weʼll look at a few colour psychology experiments and  potential hazards of not designing with tritanopia  a form of  colour-blindness  in mind.   30                     Part 2 Colour and ink   There is no denying the impact that colour has on us. Colour stirs  emotions, moves us to be patriotic, soothes our anger, builds  associations with specific products and warns us of danger. But colour  can easily be misused: too many colours and we canʼt make heads or  tails of the information; too similar a colour and we canʼt discern     a difference.    Traditionally, colour was made using ground up pigments, but   now on the web we paint freely with pixels. The range of colours far  exceeds anything weʼve had before. With graphics cards able to display  true colour in over 16.7 million distinct values, we are in danger of  overloading our readers. With ink, each new colour adds cost; with  pixels, itʼs a different story.   Data to pixel ratio         How to draw attention to the data     Rasterization ainʼt got those curves                           Just a splash of colour       In Rainbows   33  6  A Practical Guide to Designing with Data  ~ Data to pixel ratio  Data to pixel ratio   From Elements of Style, by Strunk and White  “Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no  unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences,  for the same reason that a drawing should have no  unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This  requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or  that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline,  but that every word tell.”   In his book The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, Edward  Tufte uses the phrase “data–ink ratio” to mean the amount of ink  representing the data divided by the total ink on the graph. This  creates a ratio of data presented to total ink used, the idea being to  minimize the amount of ink used on stuff that isnʼt adding value  to the data. Donʼt be confused; the data–ink ratio is not advocating  the use of as little ink as possible, but only as much ink as needed  to convey the data. Just as when writing, you should write just  what you need and nothing more, so too should you illustrate the  data and nothing more.   A ratio of 1:1 means that every drop of ink used is data. This   is hardly ever the case, so most charts and graphs have a data–ink  ratio below 1:1. At the other extreme, a ratio of 0:1 means that none  of the ink is conveying data.  100  75  50  25  0  25  50  75  100   34  In this example, ink has been used to create the axes, labels,  tickmarks and the data points. If we assume that the amount of ink  used to draw the axes and tickmarks is 60% of the total ink, then  we get the following ratio:    	 data–ink ratio =  data ink ∕ total ink used    	 data–ink ratio = 40 units∕100 units   The data–ink ratio equals 2:3. More than half of the ink used to  create the chart does not add any value. In this chapter weʼll dig  into how to reduce the unnecessary ink to level out this ratio as  much as possible to 1:1.  On screen, weʼre not dealing with ink.  Instead, we can think of this value as a data to pixels ratio. How  many unnecessary pixels were displayed to convey the message?  Can we reduce that number and still say the same thing?    35  A Practical Guide to Designing with Data  ~ Data to pixel ratio  This is a standard chart generated by Excel. All the unnecessary  pixels are highlighted. In a graphic that is 250px wide and 150px  tall  37,500 pixels total  about 55% are lit up, all of them distracting  your eyes and adding no value.  Had you asked someone in the year 2000 if it were possible   to have conversations in bursts of less than 140 characters,  they would have laughed at you; yet only a few years later SMS- length microblogging sites have sprung up all over the place. The  constraint has been short messages: get to the point, rewrite and  reword it until it fits.  Wouldnʼt it be great if e-mail were the same  way! You gotta love senten.se1  We need to take a similar approach  to designing with data. Cut out all the cruft and get to the story  behind the data.  Obviously the data points canʼt be removed so we  need to focus on other information that we assume is needed and  see if we can reduce those pixels.   The axes   Most graphs have an x-axis, a y-axis and some scale values. Some  have grid lines to help the viewer. Much of this is superfluous and  can be removed to increase our data to pixel ratio.  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4              100  75  50  25  0  1 http:  sentenc.es    36  Once we begin to add the data, we can ask ourselves, “Do we still  need all the grid information?” What if we start where the data  starts and end where the data ends? That way only the data range  is marked. This has two effects: first, it emphasizes the minimum  and maximum values; and second, it reduces the number of pixels  in the image. This technique can work on both axes.   58  32  0  58  32  0  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4  As you can see, by only labelling the data range, we can reduce the  amount of pixels.    Remember, we still need to keep the baseline zero zero scale.   Later on in part 3, when we talk about how to deceive with data,  weʼll see why this is important.    Once we have set up the basic frame in which our data will   flow, we can minimize its influence on the data. The story the data  are telling us doesnʼt include the vertical and horizontal lines; itʼs  the graph of data in between that interests the readers.   The axes, grid and labels should take the roles of a supporting   cast and simply help the lead role when needed. By minimizing  the line weight, lightening its colour, removing the portions not  being used and reducing the labels, we can move the grid from the  foreground to the background.   Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4   37  A Practical Guide to Designing with Data  ~ Data to pixel ratio  Thereʼs still room for improvement. On screen, it is hard to draw  lines thinner than one pixel; it is possible, but for these examples  weʼll set one pixel as the baseline. When designing for print,   it might be possible to draw even finer lines.       We can go still further and remove those portions of the lines   that are above the maximum data value or below the minimum.  We can also remove the tick marks as separators.   Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4  To retain the rhythm for each quarter, we can remove more parts  of the grid and the axis itself, leaving small lacunae where the  lines would have crossed the data line. Sometimes the absence of  ink can be as telling as the ink itself.  58  32  0  58  32  0  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4   38  Hereʼs another example where the frame has been reduced and  gaps demarcate divisions which were previously shown with ink.   80%  60%  40%  20%  80%  60%  40%  20%  The goal is to reduce the amount of pixels needed for the chart  overall, and this should start with the data frame. By keeping the  frame to a minimum, you create an optimized place for the data,  reducing the likelihood that it will go off course.    One problem with software packages is that graphs are   generated with very few options to turn off or adjust the axes.   For a professional chart or graph, you are forced to source or  develop your own software to produce them properly. Using  software to create charts quickly and easily is fine, but converting  them to your own style can be laborious. Even so, it is worth  the effort for the quality which can be achieved. Your personal  approach to the data will be a breath of fresh air compared to the  overused pedestrian designs of Excel, Google and other restrictive  statistics software applications.    Any important document you produce should be proofread,  spell-checked, edited and ideally professionally written. So why  plonk an off-the-shelf graphic down next to it, and ruin all the  hard work put into the text? It doesnʼt have to be that way.    39  A Practical Guide to Designing with Data  ~ Data to pixel ratio  Charts and graphs should have as much care put into their design  as the text. They should complement each other, reinforce  the companyʼs brand and image as much as any other piece of  photography or graphic design.  Not only should the charts look  good, but they should be formed properly and tell a story. This is  the difference between a chart designed as eye-candy to fill space  and a chart designed to show trends and hundreds of data points  that would otherwise be an unwieldy table.  3-D graphs  Among the worst offenders that add pixels which contribute no  additional value are 3-D charts.  Several off-the-shelf applications can make 3-D graphs and   charts automatically, but at a huge cost to the reader. The legibility  of your information soon becomes obscured by all the extra  baggage needed to make it three-dimensional. Just look at how  much space the pointless shadow takes up.   40  Placing lines behind other lines only works when the values in  the background are higher than those in the foreground – that is,  theyʼre not hidden – but there is no guarantee that this will always  be the case. As you can see above, no matter the order of the data,  some part of it is invisible. The 3-D aspect of this chart does not  make the message clearer: on the contrary, it hides the facts.   41  A Practical Guide to Designing with Data  ~ Data to pixel ratio  3-D line graphs make it difficult for the eye to determine the values  in relation to the axes. And since they are offset from the baseline,  itʼs difficult to compare data between two different rows of 3-D  bars. Take, for instance, item 5 in S1: how large is that value? How  does it compare to item 4 in S2?  Adding the extra pixels to create a 3-D chart doesnʼt add value;  it simply adds more pixels and ink, reducing the white space and  cluttering up the chart.  A large proportion of this graph consists of unnecessary pixels.  Everything in pink could be removed without changing the story.  In fact, it might actually improve it. How much of the readerʼs time  has been wasted sorting out what is important and what isnʼt?  In chapter 17 weʼll go into more depth about bar charts and look at  how to represent this same information in a more readable way.   42  40  30  20  10  0  6              This is the same chart without the 3-D effects. It is so much easier  to read.   A 3-D pie chart is probably the worst offender of all. Itʼs  important to compare the wedges from the same angle, but   when we tip the circle all the data becomes warped because   of perspective.     1  2  3  5  4   43  A Practical Guide to Designing with Data  ~ Data to pixel ratio  The three-dimensionality distorts the wedges: those closest to us  appear to be bigger and the those further away appear smaller. Can  you describe the percentage values for each wedge? Go ahead and  try: the sum of the pie is 100%, so what are the individual values?  As weʼll see in chapter 19, which is all about pie charts, the only  solution is to label each wedge and at that point you need to ask  yourself whether the pie chart is redundant altogether.  If we look closely at the pie chart, youʼll see that wedge 1 at   top right is receding into the distance, so its perspective makes it  look smaller. Wedge 4 at the front is made to look closer, so it is  distorted further and the depth of the pie is visible, adding more  pixels. In fact, wedges 1 and 4 are identical in value, but youʼd  never know that because of the perspective. Some people use this  to their advantage to obscure the truth, as weʼll see in chapter 19. The whole point of a chart or graph is to clarify a jumble of  numbers in a table. When charts are put into three dimensions,  they do anything but!   44   45  7  A Practical Guide to Designing with Data  ~ How to draw attention to the data  How to draw attention to the data   When tracking and plotting several different data sets, we often  need to highlight some portions of data. There are several ways to  call out specific parts of a diagram without drastically increasing  the pixels required. What follows is a selection of ideas to do this.  It is not an exhaustive list, nor will it work for every type of graph,  but each draws attention and focus to particular parts of the data.   Colour   Colour is a powerful tool in highlighting information. There are  two ways to use colour which make a particular item stand out.  Using a single colour within a black and white bar graph  calls attention to that information without the need for extra  labels. The addition of a single colour is a signal to the reader that  something is different, but this works most effectively when that  colour can have some meaning. When each piece of the chart is a  different colour, then the impact of any individual colour is lost.  This technique works when the graph is black and white, or a  single hue. A sudden burst of colour demands attention.   Sun  Mon  Tues  Wed  Thurs  Fri  Sat   46  If the chart is already using a fixed hue, then it is possible to vary  the intensity. Maybe this is only a black and white printout, or  you are limited to a single corporate colour, but by scaling the  brightness, contrast, lightness or transparency up or down, you  can amplify or mute the information for the reader.   Sun  Mon  Tues  Wed  Thurs  Fri  Sat  The lower the brightness, the darker it looks and the more it  stands out. If the other bars are lighter they will fall away into the  background; they remain visible for comparison if needed, but the  main value has focus.   Weight   Another way to emphasize specific data is to increase its pixel  width. On a line graph it is easy to change the thickness of each  line to make them clearer, no matter the type of printer, or we can  call out just one value and make it thicker so it stands out from  the rest.   47  A Practical Guide to Designing with Data  ~ How to draw attention to the data  50  25  0  Jan  Feb  Mar  Apr  May  Jun  A brief warning: changing an itemʼs weight might indicate  something other than straightforward emphasis. For instance,  changing the thickness of a bar in a bar chart could be misleading;  perhaps the larger dimensions of the bar signify a stronger  correlation with other data. We donʼt want to confuse the reader  – we want to better tell the story. Altering the weight of objects  could change the story in an unintentional way.  Sun  Mon  Tues  Wed  Thurs  Fri  Sat  It is important to change the weight of a variable only when it  wonʼt be mistaken for another factor.    48  Position   The human mind is very good at creating artificial groupings based  on relative position and shape. One way to provoke this tendency  is through deliberate use of white space. Using white space  effectively is more of an art than a science. I am sure there are  heuristic equations somewhere that attempt to quantify this, but  sometimes it is better to just go with your gut.  The position of some data relative to other data can lend   emphasis. For example, take a list of quarterly returns on a bar  chart. With some extra space between the fourth and first quarters  of two distinct years, a natural association and grouping emerges.  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4  It is also possible to isolate individual values and focus on them.  If we had an average for all quarters in 2009, followed by the  quarterly breakdown for 2010, we could push the average column  away slightly so it remains clear.  2009  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4  2010   49  A Practical Guide to Designing with Data  ~ How to draw attention to the data              Weʼve managed to isolate and call attention to specific data  or groups of data without having to add extra pixels to box in  information. A little more white space and proximity has done  the trick.   Shapes offer an alternative to colour when identifying data sets.  Shapes have the advantage of working well in black and white, and  are therefore more robust.  Youʼre probably familiar with the selection of horrible shapes   produced by graphing software when using multiple trend lines:  small squares, circles, triangles, crosses and others. While they  might not be aesthetically pleasing, they do play an important role  in distinguishing the data sets.  Shapes   50  25  0  Jan  Feb  Mar  Apr  May  Jun  Take the scatter plot below. There are two variables, one on the  x-axis, the other on the y-axis. We can plot several different items  into this space, but we need a way to identify them. Colour works,  but can cause problems for readers with vision problems as weʼll  see in chapter 9. Shapes are a good substitute.   50  1000  125  0.23  1.0  A quick aside: many of the issues under discussion here are  relevant beyond just charts and graphs. They can arise within  interface design generally. Buried in Appleʼs iChat® program is the  option to display the online away status as shapes. For the small  percentage of people who are red-green colour-blind, they can now  make a distinction between the different statuses using  these shapes.   51  A Practical Guide to Designing with Data  ~ How to draw attention to the data  The downside with shapes is that there is a limited set of distinct  shapes that can be used before they start to look too similar to  one another. Circles, squares, triangles, crosses and stars are  common; beyond that, the differences between the shapes become  difficult to see, particularly at small sizes. The last thing you want  is someone counting the sides of the shape to determine if it is a  pentagon, hexagon or octagon.  It is possible to use themed items, such as male female icons,  weather-related shapes and others but, as we have seen in chapter  5, this soon borders on chart junk and should be avoided.   Animation   With dynamic charts, another option is open to us: the ability to  animate the data. With this power comes great responsibility, as  an over-animated chart could look like a circus or pinball machine  with movement and flashing lights everywhere.  Colour can be animated with a pulse or glow to grab attention.   This was the premise behind the ʻYellow Fadeʼ technique  developed by 37Signals back in 20041. When an area of the data  changes, it is briefly shaded yellow before fading away and not  constantly nagging the user. It says, “Yeah, I changed what you  asked me to, and hereʼs the result. If you need anything else, just  ask. See ya.”  1 http:  37signals.com svn archives 000558.php   52  Different weights can be applied in a static chart, but in an  interactive world the userʼs actions can trigger the effect. Hovering  over a line or bar can cause a change in weight or colour, or any  other appropriate attribute. A readerʼs action could make the  corresponding line brighter and thicker, and mute all the others.  Changing the position of a chart element in a static graph can   be enhanced by movement. The item could rotate and spin, bounce  or move back and forth, or go through some other animation. The  problem is that the chart has the potential to become very busy.  Finally, shapes can be animated. Instead of a circle, square or  triangle, you could add a spinning triangle or a pulsating triangle- square morph. This very quickly becomes pointless chart junk and  falls apart when the animation is disabled, but you can see that it  is possible to achieve additional emphasis through the use   of animations.     Dynamic charts raise all kinds of questions. What happens   when the chart is printed out? Is it possible for the reader to  still distinguish the differences in the data? The animation was  intended to make a distinction and draw attention to it but is the  effect lost without it? Even if you intend the visualization to be  seen only online, the reader always has the option of printing it  out. When the medium changes, does the message change?    53  8  A Practical Guide to Designing with Data  ~ Rasterisation ainʼt got those curves  Rasterization ainʼt got those curves   An obvious problem with charting software is that it is designed  almost exclusively for the screen. Programs like Excel, Google  Charts and other paid and free alternatives all focus on output for  the monitor. They often assume that what you are generating will  be used in slideshows and stay only within the computer. We need  to consider print media such as newspapers and books.  Your desktop monitor has a resolution of between 72 and 96   pixels per inch. In contrast, your local newspaper is printed at  150–220 dots per inch and most books even higher, at 300 or more.  This means a good coffee table book is around four times denser  per unit of printing than a computer screen, yet badly pixelated  graphics are often transferred from screens directly into   printed media.  I have seen screenshots from Excel printed in newspapers.   Due to scaling, one centimetre on screen and one centimetre in  print are of very different quality. They take up the same physical  dimensions, but the number of pixels in each is vastly different.  Because of this, graphs look a lot more pixelated in print than     on screen.   54  With all this horrible scaling a curve isnʼt smooth anymore, itʼs  a jagged, blocky line. The readerʼs attention focuses on the poor  quality of the visualization rather than on the data it tries     to convey.  The higher the resolution of the printer, the more data per  inch we can achieve. So why do we use the exact same charts in  print as on screen? You end up with sloppy, pixelated printed  graphs if you do not adjust.  If you are serious about your visualizations, then use a vector   format rather than a rasterized GIF, JPG or PNG, not simply for  the quality but to ease the editing process. If your final design is a  rasterized graphic and then you are asked to change the text colour,  unless you have the original or are some Photoshop® wizard, this  is almost impossible to get right. Vector-based art allows for easier  changes, even if the original file isnʼt available.  Vector formats scale nicely no matter the print resolution or  size. Now, if you donʼt have an application that generates graphs  in vector format, you can always trace them. This can be a tedious  process, but the resulting quality is much higher and more  professional.  As your workflow evolves, there are many possibilities as   charts and graphs are generated programatically; for instance, a  new weather map can be rendered and saved every hour. There  are several formats you could choose from. As weʼve discussed,  some obvious ones are GIF, JPG and PNG, but they suffer from the  rasterization problem. In HTML5, we now have a new    element. It is a sort of sneaky halfway house between rasterization  and vector. On screen it is a vector: you describe it as arcs and  lines which are easily scalable, and it is then rendered to the  screen. If your charts and graphs are only for this medium, then    works well, but as part of a larger workflow, the    element is rendered as a GIF and is not suitable for sending to a  professional printer.   55  A Practical Guide to Designing with Data  ~ Rasterisation ainʼt got those curves  Another scriptable, vector-based solution is scalable vector  graphics  SVG . You can view SVG in most modern browsers, and  many vector applications such as Illustrator® 1 will open and  save SVG files. Just as   describes the shapes as arcs and  lines, so too does SVG, but in an XML format. Since SVG is a pure  vector-based format, when printed at high resolutions it holds  a much better curve. From a workflow perspective, this is worth  considering. Do you create everything as SVG and then rasterize  it as needed for each medium? Do you use   and target  the dots per inch for different printers when rasterizing? By now,  youʼll realize that rendering as a GIF or PNG wonʼt cut it, unless  you have a large file size in height and width so that when it is  converted from 72dpi screen resolution to 300dpi print resolution  readers wonʼt notice.  Have a look at any magazine or newspaper with a large   readership and youʼll see charts and graphs redrawn in a smooth  vector format. In smaller regional papers, youʼll more often see  badly drawn charts  even the professionals arenʼt immune to this .  This is usually due to the lack of tools, time or know-how to make  it work in print.  If you are sending graphics to print, find out what the desired  output size is. Applications such as Photoshop can adjust the dots  per inch and you can make the rasterized version of your charts  and graphs large enough so that in higher density printouts they  wonʼt be as prone to pixelation. It is best if you can design or trace  your graphs as vectors, so you donʼt have to worry about various  media or sizes now or in the future.  1 See Illustrator and Inkscape: http:  www.inkscape.org  free alternative available    56   57  9              A Practical Guide to Designing with Data  ~ Just a splash of colour  Just a splash of colour  Colour is a very powerful way to draw attention to specific  portions of the design. Colour evokes feelings and emotions,  making it an essential component in branding. There is a visceral  response to and association between certain colours and brands.   T-Mobile carefully guards its hot pink in the mobile sector and  what would Coca-Cola be without its red?    On the web, we tend not to think about the cost of colour;   whether we use one colour or ten, pixels always come for free. In  offset printing this isnʼt true! In the movement from black and  white to spot colour, to four colours or more, each time another  process is begun, another ink, all adding cost. This physical  process just isnʼt present when designing on and for the screen.  Adding more colours into a print design raises the cost and thatʼs  the kicker. When you are designing charts and graphs that will  be sent to third parties, it costs them to print, and weʼre not just  talking about printing in colour. Iʼve seen  and probably been  responsible for  horrible oversights in this area! Airline boarding  passes and other printable tickets that are so over-designed and  branded that they use up a good chunk of the colour ink in my  printer. And had I printed in greyscale, it would have just used a  hearty portion of my black ink instead!  Henry Ford once said, “Any customer can have a car painted   any colour that he wants so long as it is black”. Although the  Model T was available in multiple colours at various points during  its production, there was a time when black was the customerʼs  only option. This was due to a switch in the manufacturing  process to a quick-drying paint that only came in black. It just  goes to show that everyone is concerned about their ink  or paint   supplies.  With graphs and charts, we should take into account that   each new colour introduced costs someone money. Knowing this,  we also need to make sure that our visualizations work for the  lowest common denominator: poor quality black and white inkjet  printers. The information needs to convey the same story with or    58  50  25  0  50  25  0  Jan  Feb  Mar  Apr  May  Jun  Jan  Feb  Mar  Apr  May  Jun  Weʼve all seen ugly faxes that are so poor in quality that they are  hard to read. Now, imagine that is your data. Is it so dependent on  colour and print quality that it would just become a blob?   How can we avoid this and make sure our message gets through?  Well, instead of depending on colour to convey the meaning, we  can look into other aspects such as line style or thickness. All the  things discussed in chapter 7 apply. Establishing a robust design  will prevent problems in the future.    59  A Practical Guide to Designing with Data  ~ Just a splash of colour  “But my design isnʼt for print, itʼs dynamic and will only ever  be used on screen.”   Thatʼs fine, but there are still several aspects that need to be  considered, such as the distinct variations in the colours that can  be used. Eight per cent of males suffer from some sort of colour- blindness. So when you say, “The red line represents annual  growth”, they canʼt identify the correct line; they see two greyish  lines which are all but indistinguishable.   In colour or black and white, instead of refering to “the red   line” you can change the thickness or add shapes. All the different  steps discussed in chapter 7 are relevant.   Types of colour-blindness   Letʼs start out with a rainbow gradient consisting of all the colours  in the visible spectrum. For people with full colour vision, this  is the baseline which weʼll render as if through various types of  colour-blindness and compare the differences.  In one variety of colour-blindness it would look like the following:   60  Deuteranopia affects about five per cent of males, who are unable  to detect medium wavelength colours. This makes it difficult to  distinguish colour differences in the red-yellow-green portion of  the spectrum and the indigo-violet end of the spectrum. If you  have normal colour vision, the first half of the spectrum appears  mainly in yellow tones and the second half lacks the red tint which  combines with blue to make up purple.  Protanopia affects about one per cent of males. It has many of  the same attributes as deuteranopia, but rather than medium  wavelength detection problems, it is longer wavelengths that are  missed. This results in a greater absence of the red end of the  spectrum, making colours there seem even darker.  Tritanopia affects less than one per cent of the combined male  and female population. In this case the yellows are missing,  making colours within the green to blue part of the spectrum  indistinguishable.    61  A Practical Guide to Designing with Data  ~ Just a splash of colour  If you use colour to delineate certain parts of your design,  then you should realize that some colour-blind users might  misinterpret your data. In the world of fashion, someone might  confuse a red shirt for a green one and be mildly embarrassed.  On the road, however, you donʼt want someone confusing a red  traffic light with a green. To minimize potential accidents, traffic  lights are always laid out red yellow green from top to bottom  or left to right. A colour-blind person can at least rely on the  consistent positioning.  There are several colour-blindness simulators online which  can be used to view images as if through the eyes of people with  the various types of colour-blindness. There is also a desktop  application called Color Oracle1. which converts a whole computer  screen into these different modes. This makes checking your  design straightforward. Another benefit of running Color Oracle  locally is that it can be used without sending potentially sensitive  data over the web.  To help colour-blind people determine which colour is which,  an organization called Color Add2 has started a campaign to define  a set of icons to represent all the primary and secondary colours.  The pictorial language starts by representing the three   primary colours plus black and white.   Blue  Red  Yellow  Black  White  Using the primary colours, itʼs then possible to combine the  shapes to make the secondary colours.   1  http:  colororacle.cartography.ch    2  http:  coloradd.net                        62  Blue  Yellow  Green  Adding the symbols for white and black helps express the shading  of colours.  Light Green  Dark Green  Itʼs a long way from describing the 16.7 million possible colours  on computer screens, but for a limited set of hues it represents an  alternative. And it is certainly an interesting project with some  potential to replace those outlandish descriptive labels on the box  of crayons or coloured pencils that we all grew up with.  For more information, you can read more at the Color Add   website1 and learn how to make greys and metallics.   1  http:  coloradd.net codigo%20EN.htm   63  A Practical Guide to Designing with Data  ~ Just a splash of colour  Colour quartiles   Using colour, itʼs possible to increase the density of information  even further. A single colour can be used to represent two  variables simultaneously. The difficulty, however, is that there is  a limited amount of information that can be packed into colour  without confusion.  As weʼll see in chapter 20, a scatter plot is  capable of distinguishing four variables: the two axes; the shape of  the data point to describe its type; and its size to represent another  variable. By adding a single colour, it is possible to add not only a  fifth variable, but also a sixth.  Letʼs say that we are measuring a schoolʼs national test results.  Assuming a random sample, the results of all the schools will  probably look like a bell curve. It is possble to break down that  curve into quartiles: the values that separate the data into four  equal parts. We could give each of those four parts a distinct  colour, plot them and be done.   64              But what if we also wanted to measure a second variable, such as  the studentsʼ happiness? Again assuming a random sample, there  could be a second happiness bell curve with quartiles there too.  When we graph these variables, we could use a second type of  indicator such as a different shape or thickness. This would mean,  for example, that weʼd have some red  first quartile: test results   squares  first quartile: happiness  and all the combinations. Trying  to include a third variable becomes very difficult and cluttered.    65  A Practical Guide to Designing with Data  ~ Just a splash of colour  Instead, we could take the two existing variables and map  them onto a 4×4 grid. This gives us sixteen possible colour  combinations into which every schoolʼs test average and  happiness must fall.   Happiness  s e r o c S   t s e T  If we look at the example grid, the one:one box  top left  is a dark  golden colour and four:four is a sky blue  bottom right . We could  map the schools which have a very high test score combined  with a very low happiness rating as one:four, the light green box   bottom left . Conversely, a school which has very happy students,  but does not perform well on tests, would be a four:one, the black  square  top right .    66  This is a very compact way to display data, as long as the colour  distinctions are well defined and the number of colours is kept to a  minimum. Here, we have effectively created sixteen buckets to put  our data into. Now it is possible to use these sixteen colours in the  illustrations and represent two variables at once.  Downtown Primary School  Downtown Primary school has a blue colour which matches the  four:four quartile. This school is in the bottom 25% in tests and  bottom 25% in happiness.  Middle Road School  Whereas Middle Road School is represented by the black colour: it  tests in the lowest 25% percentile, but has a happiness rating in the  top quartile.  Later a third variable could be encoded by changing the shape  of the rectangular colour chip. Maybe the longer or taller it is, the  more students there are in the school.   67  A Practical Guide to Designing with Data  ~ Just a splash of colour  Stroop effect   In 1929, John Ridley Stroop, an American psychologist, published  a paper about subjectsʼ reaction time completing a task involving  colour names printed in a different coloured ink. Itʼs a very simple  experiment to replicate.   What became known as the Stroop effect can be observed   using some coloured markers, index cards and a group of friends.  Write the names of colours on the index cards, but use a different  colour ink than the coloursʼ names: RED, BLUE, ORANGE, GREEN,  PURPLE. When you flash up the word, the subject should respond  as quickly as possible by saying what colour ink the text is written  in, not the word itself. For instance, if the word RED written in  green ink is flashed up, the participant should say “green”, but  their first thought will probably be “red”, leading to a delay before  their response, or an error. There are several online examples you  can take to test your reaction time and experience the effect at   first hand.   The Stroop effect reveals that the text  or, rather, the readerʼs  comprehension of the text  has a stronger impact than the colour  of ink used to print it. The issues of misdirection and assumptions  are important factors in charts and design. As weʼll see in part 3,  it is possible to deceive with data because the brain focuses on  different aspects of the representation, just as in the Stroop test  we are primed for one response rather than another.   68   69  A Practical Guide to Designing with Data  ~ In rainbows  10  In Rainbows   It should be obvious by now that colour plays a significant part  in any visual presentation. Sometimes large sets of data are  generated dynamically and you canʼt spend time selecting the  perfect set of hues. What is needed is a way to choose a wide   range of colours programatically and arrive at the same result   every time.   The best way I have seen is a simple algorithm developed   by Dopplr1. This takes a text string, in Dopplrʼs case a city name,  runs it through some simple programming code and out pops a  hexadecimal  hex  colour value suitable for the web.  For those of you who are not programmers, donʼt worry; there  are plenty of websites which can do all of this for you. It just takes  a bit of cutting and pasting on your part.  The algorithm is very simple and it isnʼt random, so you will  get the same result for the same string every time. The first step is  to apply an MD5 hash function to the text string. A hash is a one- way cryptographic function, but you donʼt need to know anything  about cryptography to use this. The MD5 hash function converts  any text into a 32-character hex string.  When we run ʻBrian Sudaʼ through an MD5 function it produces:  338c88ea7790424ec9ad2a3beaeab910  This value is, to all intents and purposes, unique. Every system  that supports MD5 will produce the same answer, which is great  because itʼs a consistent way of converting a string into a really   big number.  A quick web search for “online md5” will find plenty of   websites that take a text string and return a 32-character hex value.  Try several different sites to check that the same result is returned  each time – it will be. It is also worth noting that MD5 is case- sensitive. Typing ʻBrian Sudaʼ will give a different answer than  typing ʻbrian sudaʼ.  1  http:  blog.dopplr.com 2007 10 23 in-rainbows                70  Now that we have our hex value of  338c88ea7790424ec9ad2a3beaeab910, how do we convert that into a  colour? The simplest way to make a six-character hex colour string  like those used in HTML out of the 32-character hex string weʼve  generated is to only look at the first six characters. In programming  parlance, we take a six-character substring. For non-programmers,  simply copy the first six characters of the MD5 result.  338c88 = substring "338c88ea7790424ec9ad2a3beaeab910",0,6   The string ʻBrian Sudaʼ always equates to 338c88, which is a sort of  dark turquoise colour.  Brian Suda 338c88  If you are working with applications that donʼt understand hex,  it can be converted into RGB values with a simple equation. To do  this, break the six-character string into three sets of two-character  hex strings: 33; 8c; and 88. Most drawing applications support  hex values, but it only requires a little bit of mathematics to  understand hex values and to convert them to decimal values     for RGB.   Hexadecimal numbers use base-16. Base-16 means that instead  of 0–9, we have 0–F, where A equals 10, B equals 11, and so on up to  15. The hexadecimal value FF is  15 × 16  + 15 = 255 in base-10, our  normal way of counting. Thatʼs how we get FFFFFF to be white  at RGB 255,255,255  and black 000000 to be RGB 0,0,0 . For the  ʻBrian Sudaʼ value, the hex number 33 is  3 × 16  + 3 = 51 in base-10.  So, 8c is  8 × 16  + 12  140 in base-10 , and 88 is  8 × 16  + 8  136 in  base-10 , giving RGB 51,140,136 .   33     3×base-16 +3      71  A Practical Guide to Designing with Data  ~ In rainbows  Using this MD5 technique means that the colours are reproducible  across multiple machines, languages and instances. My name  Brian Suda will be the same colour today as tomorrow on my  computer or on another server. When using large sets of data,  sets so large it isnʼt possible to sit down and assign every value a  unique colour, using this alogrithm will save time and effort. To  make this algorithm your own, you could just as easily take the  last six characters, or the first, third, fifth, seventh, thirteenth or  any combination. As long as you are consistent, you will get the  same result time and time again.  The major disadvantage of using this method is that   sometimes you get some ugly colours! Or white with off-white, or  black with near-black. Or worse, several shades of the same colour  that are very similar, making it difficult to distinguish between  them. When such results are unavoidable, you need to make  the best of a bad situation and adjust the layout and, perhaps,  change the precision of the the data for the best visualization. For  instance, if the month names create clashing colours, you can put  the month and year name through the algorithm, for example,  using the string “Jan 2010” rather than just “Jan”, or “January”  rather than the abbreviation. But remember to be consistent.  Jan  Feb  Mar  Apr May  Jun  Jul  Aug  Sep  Oct  Nov  Dec   72  There is also a complementary algorithm which can help. It returns  black or white based on a given hue. This equation is used to find  whether black or white has more contrast with the colour. If the  resulting colour is very light, this algorithm recommends using  black text. If the colour is very dark, it recommends white text. It is  a solution to the randomness of the MD5 algorithm when the value  returned is unknown.  function contrast $hexcolor {     return  hexdec $hexcolor  >0xffffff 2 ? black : white ; }   y r a r u b e F  y r a u n a J  h c r a M  l i r p A  y a M  e n u J  l  y u J  r e b m e t p e S  r e b m e v o N  r e b m e c e D  r e b o t c O  t t s s u g u A  However, when you surrender completely to an algorithm you are  stuck with it completely. Even if the colours are ugly and donʼt  work, you must stick with it so it can be reproduced consistently.  One use for the MD5 algorithm is to generate background   colours for a web page. This creates a little delight for your visitors,  as each time they return to the site it can be a different colour. Like  the BBCʼs homepage1 which changes colour based on the colours in  the main photo, you can use a random colour. Instead of using the  source of an image as the colour we could use the current time on  the server.  $backgroundColor = substring md5 time   ,0,6 ;   1     http:  www.bbc.co.uk    73  A Practical Guide to Designing with Data  ~ In rainbows  This will give a different background colour for every millisecond  when someone visits the site. Again, you have to be willing to take  the good with the bad, because there will be times you get hot  pink, mustard yellow, mint green or a muddy brown.   Recently, I decided to change the face of my wall clock. Being   inspired by the designs of others, I created a similar look, but  wanted to generate the colours programmatically.   My first run produced horrible colours, so I changed the text   slightly, but this didnʼt produce much better results. I realized  that I canʼt change fate, so I went with the design as prescribed by  the code. Through the algorithm I ran the text “00:00”, “00:30”,  “01:00”, “01:30”, all the way up to “11:00” and “11:30”, and saved  the list of corresponding hex colours. The final design of the clock  face is as follows; itʼs not bad, but not great, and I can always say  that I didnʼt decide on the colours myself, so if you donʼt like it,  you canʼt blame me.    74  If your projects revolve around a large set of values that need to be  shown in relation to one another, then this algorithm might be a  useful tool for you.   Summary  Mixing and matching colours, removing lines until you can  remove no more takes both a creative eye and the approach of a  scientist who questions everything. The chapters in this section  demonstrated the perils of bad chart design. Having poor quality  graphics or too much noise both contribute to a bad experience.  Designing with data needs to be about clarity in the story.  Sometimes you need some characters to stand out and others to  play a supporting role, but both are important in advancing the  plot. Colour and ink are both used to achieve this.  As weʼve seen in this section, ink and colour are probably the   largest contributors when designing charts and graphs, so you  need to know how to wield them carefully.  As Antoine de Saint-Exupery, the author of The Little Prince  said, “Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to  add, but when there is nothing left to take away.” With practice,  youʼll reduce your data to pixel ratio to the minimum possible  leaving only what is necessary for your readers to enjoy the story.  In the next section, Iʼll show you how to abuse what youʼve   learnt to trick your readers into thinking something they  shouldnʼt. Iʼm not showing you how to do this so you can befuddle  your readers, but so that you donʼt get tricked. To outfox a fox, you  need to think like one.                      Part 3 How to deceive  with data               “There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.”  – Anonymous, popularized by Mark Twain  The impact of visualizations often tempts us to contort the data into  the results we want. This is done both knowingly and unknowingly.  In this section, Iʼll run down a few of the different ways that   visualizations can lie about the real data. Itʼs important to understand  these issues so you can spot bad design and avoid falling into these  traps. In production, the chart might seem sensible, but if you know  the pitfalls you can correct mistakes and avoid any misrepresentation.  Next time you read a newspaper or magazine, be conscious of  the design decisions taken by the illustrator and wonder if they are  deliberately trying to influence your opinion.    Trompe lʼœil  trick the eye     Relative versus absolute    Sins of omission                                    Caught red-handed: The problem of false positives       Fudge factor    77  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Trick the eye  11  Trompe lʼœil  trick the eye   Human consciousness discerns patterns, even where none exist.  Thoughout our evolution, predators have threatened to eat us  and enemies attacked each other to take over territory. This sense  of danger lies behind why our brains are wired to see shapes in  clouds or cheese toasties.  Our brains evolved to fill in the gaps.  We use this skill on a daily basis and it can be exploited for   both good and bad. When presented with partial data, our brains  try to find patterns and project the lines where data is missing  which leads to misinterpretation.   Next time you wander down the main shopping street, have   a look at the advertisements that span multiple shop windows.  Does the ad stop at the window frame and continue again in the  next pane leaving a few inches gap, or have a few inches of the  advertisement been removed?  Hipposterous!   In chapter 6 we described the problems with 3-D charts and  graphs, and in chapter 19 we'll talk about the problems people  have judging the relative sizes of wedges in a pie chart. For now,  we'll look at how readers assess the relative size of items of chart  junk and other random or distracting shapes.  One way a chart can lie is through overemphasis of the size   and scale of items, particularly when the dimension of depth   isnʼt considered.  Letʼs take a simple bar chart comparing the amount of food  consumed by two hippos. We see that Hippo One consumes two  units of food, where as Hippo Two consumes four units. The  bar chart correctly shows that Hippo Two eats twice as much as  One because of the relative heights of the bars. This is as clean as  possible, all unnecessary pixels have been removed from the chart.               78  Hippo 1 2 units  Hippo 2 4 units  While this is an interesting statistic, maybe the illustrator wanted  to show off a bit and try to make the chart more compelling by  replacing the bars with sacks. Itʼs a little kitsch, but as the chart is  about units of food eaten, itʼs not a stretch to picture them as bags   of food.    Hippo 1 2 units  Hippo 2 4 units  The scale still claims the same values: the first item is two units  tall and the second item is four units tall. Nothing has changed in  the chart except there are graphics rather than bars. The problem  arises because we can all imagine actual bags of food in our minds  and how much effort it will be to lift one!  The chart is disorienting because although it demonstrates  a two-fold increase, the three-dimensional objects confuse our  spacial awareness. Doubling the height of the sack effectively  cubes the area, so the pixels used to draw the second sack  represent eight times the amount, yet the illustrator passes this   off as double.   79  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Trick the eye  Hippo 1 2 units  Hippo 2 4 units  Even though we read the labels, our brain perceives the second  sack as a lot more than twice the size of the first. If we were to take  the 3-D nature of a bag of food into consideration, a doubling in  volume would actually be represented like this:   Hippo 1 2 units  Hippo 2 4 units  To the untrained eye, the second sack is barely bigger than the  first. Youʼd be hard-pressed to guess it was double the volume, yet  this is more or less what the values would look like in real life.  The additional depth dimension makes the height appear much  smaller than a doubling.  Turning this idea around, converting a competitorʼs sales   figures into three dimensions can make them seem much closer  to your own. If your competitors produce twice as many widgets  as you, itʼs possible to hide most of the difference using depth to  make you look less far behind.  Sometimes there is no connection between the size of the  graphics and the values they represent. The scale of the second  item is just made bigger and then labelled correctly. We are  intended to believe the numbers, but the graphic makes a deeper  impression on us and that is what we tend to remember.   80  Hippo 1 2 units  Hippo 2 4 units  Even in two dimensions the visual representation can be out of  scale. In the example above, the second item is drawn in a different  scale to the first; it has been made arbitrarily larger. The numerical  values might be correct, but the reader will remember only that  item two is much larger than item one.  It is tempting to make charts more engaging by introducing  fancy graphics or three dimensions so they leap off the page, but  doing so obscures the real data and misleads people, intentionally  or not.  When designing charts, it is important to avoid 3-D graphics   which have an assumed volume.   The broken scale   Fooling people about the true meaning of the values doesnʼt end  with graphics. It is possible to cheat with a broken or inconsistent  scale. What would you think if you saw the following chart?   $30,000  Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sept Oct Nov Dec   81  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Trick the eye  It looks quite dynamic, stretching from the bottom of the chart  to the top. If the graph represented annual sales figures, then  perhaps the company has shot up and is doing well. If it showed  rises in the cost of living, weʼd all be crying foul! What has been  omitted is the rest of the graph below the data line. If that and a  scale are added, the graph tells a very different story.   $30,000  $15,000  $0  $28,500  $0  Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sept Oct Nov Dec  There isnʼt such a great movement when put into full context.  The graph was exaggerated using a smaller, relative difference for  a reason; it was designed to make an emotional impact. It wasnʼt  about the data but the shape!  This is why in chapter 6 we talked about not realigning the  graphʼs origin. Even though our goal is to remove unnecessary  pixels, we mustnʼt sacrifice understanding. Pixels can still be  removed, but the scale must remain anchored and consistent.  $30,000  Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sept Oct Nov Dec   82  Here, the unnecessary vertical tick marks have been removed so  that only the minimum and maximum values are labelled, along  with the origin so there is a consistent scale. There always needs to  be a baseline for comparison, otherwise the chart is biased to the  small, sample set of data being shown. Scales and context cannot  be judged accurately without knowing the zero point.  The valueless scale   Another sneaky way to cheat is to create a graph with no explicit  values. A line sloping upwards on a chart looks impressive but, if  the scale is not provided, who is to say the steps are $1 or $1,000?  Mon  Tues  Wed  Thurs  Fri  Without any reference, we canʼt grasp if this is impressive or  meagre growth. Given that labels were abandoned, Either the  author is hiding the truth, or the entire chart was fabricated in  an attempt to look significant without actually conveying any  information at all.   83  A Practical Guide to Designing with data ~ Trick the eye  By changing the scale, it is possible to change the shape of the  graph and, therefore, peopleʼs impression of the growth.  5  4  3  2  1  25  16  9  4  1  10000  1000  100  10  1  As you move from left to right, each chart seems to show ever  more impressive growth, but in reality they are the same chart.  In the first, the scale grows linearly: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on; in the  second, it increases polynomially: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25; and in the third,  logarithmically: 1, 10, 100, 1000. It is exactly the same data, but  plotted using different scales. This is why you should never trust a  chart that lacks some sort of explicit explanation of what is being  measured.    84               85  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Relative versus absolute  12  Relative versus absolute  Another way to obscure the truth is to hide it with relative  numbers. Weʼre bombarded with this all the time in quotes like,  “computer sales are up three per cent from last month”.  That sounds fine, but three per cent up from what?  Relative scales are always given as percentages or    proportions. An increase or decrease of a given percentage only  tells us part of the story, however. We are missing the anchoring   of absolute values.  Take this truthful, but misleading press release:  “ABC Widget Corporation had an incredible fourth quarter.  It increased sales by 135% over the same time last year. If we  compare that to its nearest rival, XYZ Cogs, which had only  a 34% increase in sales this quarter, ABC Widget Corp. is  flying high.”  ABC Widgets  135%  XYZ Cogs  34%  This looks like an increase of over 100% in sales for ABC Widget  Corp. versus its rival. The problem is that this is only half the story.  We are missing the absolute values.    86  A quick lesson in logarithms  A logarithmic series is one that increases by powers of ten at each step: 1, 10, 100, 1,000 on up;  a zero is added to the end each time. So why is this important? Well, increasing ten widgets by  one represents a ten per cent increase. Adding one to a hundred widgets is only a one per cent  increase. One widget added to another one, and the widgets have doubled: a 100% increase! Looking back at the sales figures for ABC Widget Corporation versus sales at XYZ Cogs,   something similar is happening.  ABC Widget Corp. is a small, family-run business that sells around  10,000 widgets each quarter. In the fourth quarter, it happened  to get a large order from a new customer and increased sales to  23,500, a relative increase of 135% and an absolute increase of  13,500.  XYZ Cogs is a multinational firm that sells around three   million widgets per quarter. With a growing widget market, it  added an additional 900,000 widgets in this quarter. Thatʼs only a  relative 34% increase, but an absolute increase many times greater  than ABC Widget Corp.   ANUAL GROWTH IN UNITS  ABC Widgets  XYZ Cogs   87  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Relative versus absolute  When we look at the numbers in absolute terms, then ABC Widget  Corp.ʼs press release isnʼt as stunning as it originally sounded.  With a production of 23,500 widgets in total, compared to XYZ  Cogsʼ 3.9 million, it is laughable to compare itself to its rival in this  way. The smaller 34% increase for XYZ Cogs is hundreds of times  larger than all of ABC Widget Corporationʼs entire sales. The moral  of the story is not to be fooled by relative values: they could be  much less of a feat than the PR company would have you believe.   Using relative values to your advantage   There are times when you might want to use the relative values  rather than the absolute. One example might be poll results. In  my local free newspaper, there is usually some sort of survey  question. I am very sceptical when the response values are 75% to  25%, or 67% to 33%. It just makes me think that only three or four  people responded!  Relative values hide the number of participants  N , which  can be a good thing in some cases. A poll that shows exactly the  number of votes cast is an open invitation to spammers! If people  can see that their individual vote has been added, some will keep  voting to watch it roll over and over and over to the next number.  With a very large N value, it takes many more submissions to  move the relative values from 49% to 50% than to make an  absolute count keep ticking over one higher each time.   In political elections, to show the N values might discourage  people from voting in what is a close race relatively. If the tallies  for the candidates were 51% to 49% with N values of 5.1 million  to 4.9 million, voters might question the power of their vote and  become apathetic.    88  Jumping lists   Another place where relative values are used without reference to  their absolute positions is in lists. Shocking headlines that read,  “More people worried about volcano eruptions than filing late  taxes!” arenʼt really telling us anything. There is no reference point  to understand how worried people are in these situations.  Imagine a list of life concerns. Maybe forgetting to file your   taxes was 37th on the list and volcano eruptions ruining your  holiday was 38th. In a particular month, perhaps more people  worried about volcanic ash clouds and pushed it up to 36th place,  forcing down killer bee attacks to 37th and pushing tax deadlines  down to 38th place.  Simply saying that more people are worrying about volcanoes   than tax deadlines is missing the point. The real question that  needs answering is by how much.  This returns us to our lesson in logarithms. If a survey only  found one person worrying about tax deadlines, then only two  people need to worry about volcanoes to beat it. Thatʼs a 100%  increase by doubling. But what if the survey found that 1,000  people were worrying about tax deadlines and only 501 about  volcanoes? Again, a 100% relative increase would be needed to beat  tax dealines, but now that means 500 people! When newspapers  publish outlandish jumping list style headlines, you have to  wonder if it was newsworthy in the first place. Omitting absolute  figures for the lists is a pretty good give away.    89  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Sins of omission  13  Sins of omission   A sin of omission – leaving something out – is a strong one and  not always recognized; itʼs hard to ask for something you donʼt  know is missing. When looking into the data, even before it is  graphed and charted, there is potential for abuse. Simply not  having all the data or the correct data before telling your story can  cause problems and unhappy endings.   Self-biasing surveys   There are surveys which eliminate some of the factors being  researched. Phone polls work well for people who have phones!  They also over-represent stay-at-home parents and retired people  and under-represent the workforce, students and younger people.  “100% of the people we e-mailed use the Internet”  A good survey organization will take this into account and either  adjust the data accordingly, adjust the margin of error, or focus  their polling on the under-represented groups in a different ways.  But not all companies are so thorough.  The statistics are only as good as the cross section of data   they represent. Asking 1,000 older people about their favourite  video game does not make for a good survey result if youʼre  trying to find out what will be the hottest this Christmas, even if  scientifically conducted.   Missing data   Sometimes it is less about bad data and more about data that is  missing altogether. In some situations, the group of people asked  to participate is self-selecting; results can be biased because only  those people available or willing to participate complete   the survey.      90              I remember hearing a story that beginnerʼs luck really does exist  and that it disappears over time. I found it very hard to believe!  Games of chance are just that, chance, not luck, and the longer  you play, the more averages come in to force. It turns out that the  explanation for the idea that beginnerʼs luck really does exist is not  mathematical but psychological.  Letʼs say ten friends get together to play a new card game. After   the first game, five people lose; they are so disappointed that they  quit and never want to play the card game again. The remaining  five continue to play for the rest of their lives. The more they play,  the more they feel that they had beginnerʼs luck and as they lose   or, more accurately, the house catches up  it wears off. In some  ways, for these players the myth of beginnerʼs luck is true. In their  eyes and the eyes of any observer, their record started off with a  series of wins and steadily got worse. The missing data is all the  people who lost in the beginning and never continued to play; they  dropped out of the statistical pool. All of these people disprove the  idea of beginnerʼs luck, but they are nowhere to be seen.  The same goes for why all the places you visit seem more   popular than expected. It is a strange phenomenon, but if we peel  back the statistics weʼll see it isnʼt so unusual. Is that favourite  coffee shop always more crowded when you visit? Well, you are  more likely to end up at a place when it is crowded than when it  isnʼt simply because when places arenʼt crowded there are less  people to make up the statistic.  Similarly, this is why it seems that our friends have more   friends than we do. The probability that we will make friends with  someone who has only one or two friends is very low, whereas the  probability of making friends with someone who has a thousand  friends is much higher. Therefore, it seems that your friends  always have more friends than you do. You arenʼt considering all  the people in the world with few friends that you donʼt know.  When looking at data sets produced by others, you need to ask   yourself if there could be missing data.    91  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Sins of omission  Meta-analysis   If you throw enough information at the wall, something will stick.  When searching for a specific result, you can run a test enough  times to achieve any answer you are looking for. And if your  desired outcome is a one-in-a-million chance, you just need to  run a million tests.  It is like the infinite amount of monkeys typing on an infinite   number of typewriters; one will eventually recreate the works of  Shakespeare. Nothing is impossible, just improbable.  Within any given sample there will be outliers. If the sample  set is small enough then these outliers can overwhelm the data.  A company wanting to present itself in a particular manner  can just continue to run test after test until the result it  wants is achieved. This is how nine out of ten doctors end up  recommending X as the leading brand. How many sets of ten  doctors did this test include? Maybe during the first trial only  three out of ten approved. Those results were trashed and the  trial was rerun. Next time the results were worse and only one  in ten approved. The tests continued until a set of nine doctors  approved. At this point the tests were stopped and the company  could slap a sticker on the product saying “Nine out of ten doctors  recommend Brand X. Itʼs been scientifically tested and approved!”  This is where meta-analysis comes into play. Meta-analysis   consists of taking data from several trials and analysing them  together as if they were from one test. The extreme outliers for the  pros and cons will be smoothed into a more realistic reflection of  the data.   92   93  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Caught red-handed  14  Caught red-handed: the problem of  false positives   Just because the test results come back as positive doesnʼt mean  thatʼs the end of the story.  True  False  Positive  True Positive  False Positive  Negative  True Negative  False Negative  When classifying data, there are four categories of results: true  positives; false positives; true negatives; and false negatives.   True positives and true negatives are easy to explain. Take, for  instance, popular kebab meat, the kind seen rotating on spits. No  animal ever looked like that: the meat has been processed. To test  the meat to find out if it contains lamb, a sample is taken and sent  off to the lab. A true positive means it was confirmed that, yes,  this meat contains lamb. A true negative would confirm that, no,  this meat does not contain lamb. This is pretty straightforward.  Trickier and more error prone are false negatives and  false positives.    94  A false positive is when something is reported as true when it is  actually not the case. In our kebab example, the lab would report  back that, yes, the meat contains lamb, when in fact it doesnʼt.  A false negative is just the opposite, when the lab reports, no, this  does not contain lamb when in fact it does.  Finding out what your dinner contains, however, might not be   the most exciting example of false positives.  The same logic applies to every test that has some probability  of an error – everything from carbon dating to DNA tests, Martian  soil samples to loan agreements. With all of these examples,  some cases are truly correct and incorrect, but others are always  mislabelled one way or another. The key is to minimize or at least  account for these situations.  Letʼs say you and your work colleagues are gearing up for   a Subbuteo® championship. One hundred people enter the  competition but, before it starts, everyone is required to take a  drug test to check for performance enhancing substances.   The test results are 90% accurate and take only a few minutes.  To your misfortune, you have tested positive and are barred from  competing. All those hours of training down the drain!  Letʼs assume that ten people really are taking controlled   substances. After administering the test, nine out of those ten  will get caught as true positives because the test is 90% accurate.  This also means that there is one false negative: one person has  slipped through the drug test net. He or she is taking controlled  substances, but represents the 10% where the test failed.   So that leaves us with ninety honest, hard-working people.  Youʼd assume that if they are clean, then theyʼll pass the test just  fine. Whatʼs to worry about, right? On average, however, with  ninety participants there will be nine people who are clean but  test positive; a 90% accuracy rate for the test means 10% will test  positive. In the sample set of ninety, there will be nine   false positives.     95  A Practical Guide to Designing with data ~ Caught red-handed  90 Honest hard-working players  10 Actual  cheaters  True negatives  people who passed the test and are clean  False positives  people who failed the test, but are actually clean  True positives  people who failed the test and are taking controlled substances  False negatives  people who passed the test, but are taking controlled substances   So what are the odds that someone who tests positive is actually  clean? Well, nine people have tested positive as false positives,  but there were also nine others who tested as true positives.  That means there are eighteen people who failed the test. So  thereʼs a fifty-fifty chance that any one of these people who have  been removed from the tournament are not taking performance  enhancing drugs.  Just because someone tests positive, doesnʼt necessarily mean   that they are positive. Using a cheap test with a high margin of  error will inadvertently flag some false positives. In this example,  the sample group is small, only eighteen out of the hundred, and  therefore longer, more expensive and complex tests can be used  just on those eighteen to narrow down the positive results. Controlled substance tests, just like tests for cheating and money  laundering, are screening for positive results. Therefore, itʼs  best to minimize the chances of false negatives: someone who    96              is actually cheating, but tests negative and slips through the net.  In our sample set, there is one person who fits this category, the  false negative. Mathematically, the more we reduce the chance  of someone slipping through  false negatives , the more people  accidentally get blamed  false positives .  The equation to determine false true positives negatives is   pretty easy if you have the data.  If everyone in the US population, all 300 million people, were  to take a free test which looked for a life-threatening disease, how  many peopleʼs tests would be false positives? First, we need to  know how accurate the test is; letʼs say that it is 99.9% correct in its  diagnosis. Next, we need to know how many people are affected by  this disease. In this example, only one in a million people.  To test how many people are safe from the disease  the true  negative  we take the total one million and subtract the expected  one to get 999,999 people who are expected to test negatively. We  then divide that by the million to find the probability of not having  the disease, which is 0.999. This leaves a very small chance that  any individual is affected. Next, we need to take that probability  and multiply it by our sample size  in this case, the population of  the USA: 300 million  and then multiply the result by the accuracy  of the test: 99.9%  or 99.9∕100 = 0.999 .   For our true negative count weʼd have:  300,000,000 ×  999,999∕1,000,000  × 0.999 = 299,699,700   population size  ×  probability of not having the disease  ×  quality of the test   Thatʼs 299,699,700 people who test clean and are truly clean.  For our true positive count, weʼd use almost the same equation, but  instead of multiplying by the probability of being healthy, we use  the likelihood of having the disease, in this case one in a million:  300,000,000 ×  1∕1,000,000  × 0.999 = 299.7   97  A Practical Guide to Designing with data ~ Caught red-handed  So just about 300 people will test positive and be positive for  the disease – these are our true positives. This result also makes  sense; if one in a million people have the disease, then weʼd expect  300 people in our sample size to have it.  Now letʼs work out how many people are false positive. These  are the ones who receive bad news when in fact they are perfectly  healthy. This is the time when someone should ask for a second  opinion or a different type of test to move them out of the false  positive pool and into the true negatives.   We use the same equation as the true negative, except we use   the probability that the test is wrong instead of correct, in this case  0.1% – the test is 99.9% accurate, remember.   300,000,000 ×  999,999∕1,000,000  × 0.001 = 299,999.7  It seems high, but makes sense if you understand that 0.1% of the  people will fall through the testing margin of error. These 300,000  people are getting bad news, but are actually healthy.  But the worst category to be in is the false negative. You pass   the test, but donʼt know you have the disease. We use the same  equation as the true positive, but change the probability of the test  to 0.1%.   300,000,000 ×  1∕1,000,000  × 0.001 = 0.3  Fortunately, there is less than one person out of 300 million who  received a clean bill of health, but is very sick.   The false positives and false negatives are all the people who  are at risk. In our case, 300,000 people were wrongly identified as  positive and 0.3 people were wrongly identified as clean. Thatʼs  one out of every thousand people who are incorrectly diagnosed.  In a large population, thatʼs a lot of people who could be told the  wrong result even though the test is 99.9% correct!   98  True  False  Positive   1 1,000,000  × .999 =   999,999 1,000,000  ×   300,000,000 ×  300,000,000 ×  300,000  .999 =  299,699,700  .001 =  300  =  0.3  Negative  300,000,000 ×  300,000,000 ×   999,999 1,000,000  ×    1 1,000,000  × .001  To double-check that our calculations are correct, you can add up  all the totals in each of the squares.  299,699,700 + 300 + 300,000 + 0 = 300,000,000  So every person in the sample set is accounted for in the matrix   of possibilities.    However, the maths that makes the test 99.9% accurate   through eliminating people as true negatives also means that a  positive test result has a 99.9% probability of being wrong.   If we look at everyone who tested positive we get a total of  300,300. If someone received the bad news of a positive result,  what are the odds that they are actually positive? To calculate those  odds, we need to take the 300,000 false positives and divide that by  all those who tested positive, whether truly or not: 300,300. That  gives them a 99.9% chance of being clean even if they are given the  bad news.    99  A Practical Guide to Designing with data ~ Caught red-handed  So the next time a doctor tells a patient that this test is 99.9%  accurate and he or she has tested positive, the patient should  know there is a 99.9% probability that the result is a false positive  – I would ask for a second opinion.    False positives and false negatives are sometimes referred to  as Type I and Type II errors. If you are interested in learning more,  there is plenty of literature out there on this topic.       100   101  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Fudge factor  15  Fudge factor   One thing to be aware of both when designing visualizations   and reading them, is the amount of information behind each   data point.  A weather map gives a general impression of whether the   temperature will be warm or cold, or if rain is likely. Somewhere  along the line, someone thought about providing a three-day and  then a five-day forecast. Forecasting involves taking advanced  weather models and extrapolating out for a few days into the  future, but the accuracy of past forecasts is rarely mentioned.   Nor do people rely on the five-day forecast without checking   again during those five days. There is a continual refinement of  the information as time passes.  That said, what if you were planning a big party this weekend?   If you consulted the five-day forecast on a Monday and there  was a 60% chance of rain, what would the margin of error be?  You simply donʼt know. If it were 60% plus or minus 30%, the  possibility of rain would be anywhere within a 30% to 90%  chance. Flipping a coin – heads it rains, tails it doesnʼt – has a  better prediction accuracy: you have a 50% chance of getting it  right. The forecastʼs margin of error is 60%!  The margin of error or ʻfudge factorʼ is important, but itʼs   something that is seldom mentioned or displayed.  One area in which margins of error are displayed is political  polling. Organizations canvass people to ask if they are going to  vote for Candidate A or Candidate B. It might be reported in the  newspaper that Candidate A has a lead of 51% with a margin of  error of 3%.  Candidate A 50.9%  Candidate B 49.1%  * With a margin of  error of 3%   102  With such a small margin of error, the difficulty is that in one poll  Candidate A might be as low as 48% and Candidate B as high as  52% because three percentage points can be added or subtracted  from each total. Claiming a victory for Candidate A when the  margin of error does not exceed the difference between the two  candidatesʼ shares is a gamble at best.              Associated Press, taken by Byron Rollins  When dealing with statistics, there are several ways to generate a  margin of error, but we need to worry less about the methods and  more about the design of the data.  The most common way to visualize margin of error is whisker  bars. Many software applications allow you to add these into your  graphs and charts.   103  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Fudge factor  The whisker bars allow us to show a value at the height drawn, but  provide a range within which the actual value might reside. These  work well for discrete measurements, but in an example running  over time, it might be better to have an upper bound line and a  lower bound line. This gives an area in which the value could     be recorded.  The line represents the recorded values, and the shaded area is the  region where the values could appear given the margin of error at  any particular time. The narrower the shaded area, the better. That  means the measurements are more precise and the data will be  closer to the measured value. In this example, the data could be at  the very top or very bottom of the shaded region creating a large  range of possibility for the true answer.  Certain types of data do not have margins of error. A budget   assessment, for example, reports that $123.45 was spent this week  or it wasnʼt. So area graphs, pie charts and others that canʼt have  whisker bars are ideal for presenting this fixed type of data. Future  projections, sample sets and experimental observations could well  contain a range for each value which area graphs and pie charts  cannot account for.    104  Precision error   An indication that the data is not statistically sound is when it is  almost too precise. Saying that on average a family of four spends  around $127.86 per week on groceries sounds much more scientific  than saying that it spends around $130 a week. But where might  such an exact value have come from?  It was probably the average taken from the sample. The   problem is that nothing is known about the sample: was it 100  people, or 100,000 people? Were people asked to produce receipts  or just write down what they thought they spent? Personally, I  might be able to tell you how much I spent on my last trip to the  grocery store, but for the last 52 weeks?  Be wary of any such exact values quoting the average anything   of a group of people. One aspect we havenʼt discussed, which  is beyond the scope of designing charts and graphs, is data  collection. It is possible to create averages, graphs, time series and  all sorts of fancy plots but if the initial data is not reliable then  everything else that follows falls down. This goes back to chapter  13 about sins of omission.  There can be many issues surrounding the quality of a survey:   the sample group and size; the self-selecting nature of the group,  and so on. Asking people about their salaries rarely results in a  precise average; people are often reluctant to reveal how little they  make and tend to round up or, conversely, they might round down  to put off the tax man, or even refuse to answer. Like the phone  poll that reported that 100% of people have phones, there is always  the chance of a built-in bias which charts and graphs    cannot expose.   105  A Practical Guide to Designing with data ~ Fudge factor  Confidence and error  The margin of error used in every calculation is related to the confidence interval. Since surveys  only use a sample, say a thousand people rather than the entire population, it can never be said  that the sample set exactly represents the true outcome. This is why a confidence interval is set;  you are 99% confident, or 95% or 90% and so on. Lowering the confidence interval lowers the  margin of error. If you are only 30% confident that the results are correct, then the margin of error  does not have to be large. If you claim a higher confidence interval, then the margin of error also  increases. It appears somewhat counter-intuitive, but thatʼs the way it works.  The confidence interval determines the margin of error based on the t-value in a look-  up table. There are whole textbooks written about sampling procedures, sampling error and  confidence intervals based on the bell curve.  A quick note about averages   Something we all learned years ago in our mathematics lessons,  but have probably forgotten, is that there are actually three  different ways to reach an average: mode; median; and mean.  For the following values 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 15, 121 we can compute three different types of average.  Mode The mode is the most frequently occuring value in the set. In this  example the mode is 3 because it appears seven times in the set.  Median The median is the middle value in the ordered set. There are  fifteen items in the list, so the eighth item is in the middle,  separating the top half of the set from the bottom half of the set.  The eighth value is 3.  Mean The mean is what most people understand as the average.  To calculate the mean, add up all the values, then divide by the  total number of values. Thus, 169 divided by 15 equals 11.26.   106  From these results you can see it is possible to quote one average  which is wildly different from another! An average of over eleven  is impressive; an average of three less so. Neither is a lie: each one  just reflects a selective use of the data to influence a decision.  Average personal income can be examined in this way. The   salaries of the inhabitants of any given neighbourhood would yield  different averages. One or two wealthy individuals could raise the  mean because their high income gets spread amongst everyone  elseʼs. So when boasting about how great your neighbourhood is,  you could inflate your status to the point where it makes you look  the best. In this case, having a few wealthy individuals raising the  mean makes you look good too.   The mode and median of the neighbourhoodʼs salaries   could be much lower than the mean. If everyoneʼs salary was  different, but maybe two or three people at the lower end all made  minimum wage, then the minimum wage would be the mode and  one possible average. But why would anyone want to quote their  neighbourhood at the lower end? Well, maybe when it comes to  paying council tax, residents could try to claim their area is poor  and should pay a lower amount because the average citizen canʼt  afford to pay more: the average person just makes minimum wage.  The same goes for the median – it too could be used to obscure   the truth. It isnʼt a lie: the median value is an average, just not the  expected mean average.   You should always fully explain which type of average you  are using, and if you are looking at a chart that doesnʼt then you  should be suspicious and ask questions.    107  A Practical Guide to Designing with data ~ Fudge factor  Summary  I hope the next time you see an infographic, youʼll look twice now  to see if it is trying to trick you! Not everyone does it on purpose;  ignorance of the issues is the most likely cause.  Knowing about these issues, you can always ask yourself how   to redraw the chart to remove ambiguity. If you can dissect the  design and rebuild it to be more understandable then you wonʼt  get fooled; plus, youʼll learn how to create a better design if you  run into the same problems.  So far weʼve spent the first three parts of the book learning   indirectly about charts and graphs. Weʼve delved into some  background information and historical context, the problems  of static and dynamic designs, and the physical dimensions of a  chart. Then we moved on to ink and colour, learning how to set  the framework for a good story, and how to call out and highlight  specific portions of the data. In this section, we covered how  people mislead with data design. Understanding this will prevent  you from making the same mistakes when designing.   Youʼve been given the groundwork for creating your own chart   and graph designs. You have the knowledge to question what is  wrong and the tools to fix mistakes.   In the next two parts, weʼre going to examine specific types of  charts and graphs, pulling out a few common charts in Part 4 and  discovering the situations in which to use each one. Weʼll weigh  up the pros and cons, where each type of chart fails and succeeds,  along with a bit of history and some things you probably   didnʼt know.   108  In part 5, weʼll spend five chapters looking at less common charts  and graphs. There are two major reasons for taking time to study  these more unusual forms. Firstly, when you do encounter these  rare designs, youʼll be able to spot problems with them. You  wonʼt be awed by something new and cool; you can sit back and  say, “Sure, itʼs pretty, but itʼs not working well here.” Secondly, as  you graduate from the basics of charts and graphs and progress  to visualizations and infomation graphics, knowing about the  problems and failings of these more unusual types will be useful.  Theyʼre not so common for a reason: they are either less effective,  more difficult to interpret, or incredibly specific in their usage, all  of which are important for a well-rounded designer of data   to understand .                      Part 4 Common types   of charts    To speak any language, we start with the basics. This is no less true for  the language of charts, graphs and visualizations. In this section, weʼll  discuss five common types of charts and the various ways they can be  presented. It is important to examine the strengths and weaknesses  inherit in each design; understanding the ins and outs of these  common types of charts will help you identify the types of stories they  are best at telling.               Area graphs and charts                                                                             Line graphs    Bar charts    Pie charts    Scatter plots   111  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Line graphs  16  Line graphs  Line graphs are so called because they contain at least one  continuous line which connects data points in a series.  Multiple sets of data points can be plotted on to the same line  graph. For instance, a line graph could represent time against  income, or income against population; you name it, anything  goes as long as there are just two variables.  Line graphs work best when the data is continuous. This   could be a temperature rising and falling, the velocity of a moving  object, or other continuous data. This type of data is information  that can be sliced into smaller and smaller pieces and still offer a  corresponding value.   This is where the line graph differs from other charts and  graphs: its ability to tell a story between the plotted points –   a story that is as powerful as the data that is known.     4  3  2  1  0  1  2  3  4  5  One of most common variables used in line graphs is time; we  want to know how something is progressing through time. Time  is continuous: it is possible to divide the units into smaller and  smaller pieces.  Like that old story about talking a step halfway to  the wall: youʼll never actually get there – we can keep splitting a  second into smaller and smaller pieces and never reach zero.  A    112              line graph can also be used to project trends into the past or future.  After the data points have been collected, a best fit line is created  and extended in both directions. The validity of any projection is  in no way guaranteed by the use of a line chart, but the chart can be  used as a visual aid.  In the following table of dates and values, could you easily   work out the point at which the company will break the one  million dollar mark?  1 June  1 July  1 August  1 September  1 October  1 November  1 December  $200,000  $210,000  $220,000  $240,000  $290,000  $510,000  $780,000  What would you guess? January? Maybe February or March to be on  the safe side?   What about if those same data points were converted into a   line graph?  $1,000,000  $800,000  $600,000  $400,000  $200,000  $780,000  $510,000  $290,000  $210,000  $220,000  $240,000  June  July  Aug  Sept  Oct  Nov  Dec  Jan  Feb  Mar   113  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Line graphs  The line graph makes it much easier to determine the projected  value at any point in time.  As well as displaying known points, a line graph allows us to  look at the values between the points. Letʼs look back at our table.  What was the value on 15 October, four and a half months into the  data? On a line graph, we can draw a line up from the time axis  halfway between the known October and November points until  it meets the curved line joining the plotted values, and then draw  another line across to the vertical axis to find the required value.  $1,000,000  $800,000  $600,000  $400,000  $200,000  $780,000  $510,000  $390,000  $210,000  $220,000  $240,000  $290,000  June  July  Aug  Sept  Oct  Nov  Dec  Jan  Feb  The answer is approximately $390,000; this is only an estimate,  but itʼs probably a better estimate than just using the table would  have generated. We can be pretty sure that the result is in the  general area of that value.   Highlighting specific values   Chapter 7 demonstrated that there are several ways to use colour  and shapes to distingush the different values on a line graph.  We also saw how frugal we can be with the amount of pixels used    114  in a line graph compared to other types of graph. Since line graphs  are fundamental to designing with data, you need to always be  aware of the strengths and weaknesses of how to bring specific  values to the reader's attention.   Multi-variable line graphs   Creating charts that display one variable at a time is  straightforward. Line graphs can track two variables with a single  graph: one variable on the x-axis and one on the y-axis. But can we  encode more than two?  Itʼs possible to plot n dimensions, but this rapidly becomes   confusing and enters into the realm of visualizations – the spectre  of chart junk looms before us. Itʼs a useful exercise to walk through  how this happens and to see for yourself that the limits are  stretched pretty quickly.  Letʼs take a companyʼs net worth over time and plot those two   on a line graph.  $1,000,000  $800,000  $600,000  $400,000  $200,000  June  July  Aug  Sept  Oct  Nov  Dec  Jan  Feb   115  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Line graphs  The longer the company is in business, the more money it makes.  This is a standard two-variable plot: time and net worth. To add  a third variable, letʼs map the number of employees into the line.  The larger the dot at each measurement, the more employees work  at the company. We'll be looking at problems with circles and  relative size comparisons in chapter 19.  $1,000,000  $800,000  $600,000  $400,000  $200,000  $1,000,000  $800,000  $600,000  $400,000  $200,000  June  July  Aug  Sept  Oct  Nov  Dec  Jan  Feb  A fourth variable could also be illustrated by changing the colour  of the line. Each colour might represent a different CEO.  June  July  Aug  Sept  Oct  Nov  Dec  Jan  Feb   116  The number of variables that can be plotted is limited only by  your imagination, the amount of colours you want to use and how  far you take it before chart junk develops and the graph collapses  under its own weight.   Sparklines   Sparklines are small lines introduced right into the text where the  items are being discussed. Edward Tufte formulated this concept  in his 2006 book, Beautiful Evidence, but it harks back to a much  older idea. In the 1500s, Nicolaus Copernicus jotted down notes  in the margins of his observation log books as he stared through  his telescope at distant planets. Some of his notes took the form of  small inline illustrations which acted like words. He was exploring  such new territory in his studies of the heavens that he just drew  pictures of what he saw rather than writing a lengthy explanation.  Edward Tufte did something similar by embedding small line  graphs within with text.   This week XYZ companyʼs stock      16.76  85.12     shot up to 34th on the market  There are several computer applications which generate sparklines  based on a data set.   The biggest difference between line graphs and sparklines is   that a sparkline is compact with no grid lines. It isnʼt meant to give  precise values; rather, it should be considered just like any other  word in the sentence. Its general shape acts as another term and  lends additional meaning in its context.  The driving forces behind these compact sparklines are speed   and convenience. Instead of discussing a teamʼs performance  and then referring to “Table 3 on page 896”, the information is  displayed right there, inline. It keeps the reader in the flow of the    117  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Line graphs  text, adds information where it is needed, aids comprehension  and gives a scale and weight to the values in the prose. If I said,  “It was a great year for the company!” it might sound impressive;  having a sparkline available would let people decide if my  excitement was warranted or not.    118   119  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Bar charts  17  Bar charts  The bar chart is the go-to chart, the Swiss Army knife of charts – it  can be your bread and butter. There are so many ways to take this  basic idea and adapt it to make many other types of charts. You  can decorate it with whiskers and candles, rotate it, add handles  and bedeck it with all sorts of jewellery to further tell a story.  Unlike pie charts, as weʼll see later, bar charts have the ability  to easily display two variables, one on the horizontal axis and one  on the vertical. Pie charts can show two variables as well, but one  will always be a value relative to one hundred per cent. Bar charts  can take this much further and more meaningfully.  The biggest benefit of bar charts is that different items of data   can easily be compared visually. A horizontal line can be drawn  from the axis or the top of one bar across all the others for easy  comparison. When each bar is properly labelled, it is also possible  to reorder the values without losing information – bar charts can  be ordered from lowest to highest, alphabetically or any other way  – as long as it best tells the story.  Bar charts can also employ many of the aspects we discussed  in chapter 7 about highlighting specific data; colour, spacing, size,  and so on, can all be changed to create new associations.   Multiple items can be compared next to each other, such as male  female count by grade.  Line graphs versus bar charts   You might wonder how a bar chart differs from a line graph. There  is no hard and fast rule about when to use a bar chart rather than  a line graph. Each makes a few assumptions which, depending  on the data, need to be considered. A line graph assumes that any  point on the line is measurable and a value can be extracted. If the    120  values on your horizontal axis are 1, 2, 3, 4 and so on, then every  point on that line has a value. For instance, you could compute the  value of the line for 1.5 or 3.14 or 5.618.  A bar chart models discrete values. There might not be a  bar chart value for 1.5 unless there is actually a bar there. This  is why there is normally a space between the bars of a bar chart,  to show that they are not connected and that one value does not  flow into the next. There are some instances where the bars can  be put together, when the data does flow, and weʼll discuss these  histograms later in this chapter.  With bar charts, order is not necessarily important. Each bar is  independent of the others, so they can be sorted alphabetically, by  value or in some other order. With a line graph, the correct order is  essential since the data represented is continuous.  What determines whether you should use a bar chart or line  graph is the type of data and how flexible it is. The differences are  subtle, but can be very important overall.   Whiskers   One advantage of the bar chart is that the bars can be decorated  to reveal some additional statistical information. As we saw in  chapter 15, there is often a fudge factor, a percentage that might  be over- or underestimated. This is often seen in political polling:  Candidate A is leading 54% to 46% with a margin of error of plus or  minus 2%.   50%  40%  30%  20%  10%  A  B   121  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Bar charts  To illustrate this using a pie chart is impossible – there is no way  to add this four per cent buffer – but with line and bar charts  we can. Whiskers added to each bar reveal the upper and lower  boundaries of the data.   Each whisker is a small vertical line representing plus or   minus two per cent from the value, with some horizontal lines  to make the ends easier to see and measure. As discussed in  chapter 6, the data to pixel ratio should be kept to a minimum, so  remember to keep the design as light as possible.   Taken to extremes, the bars are removed from the chart  altogether. Rather than using all the ink for the bar, what if  the value was shown as just a point? The whiskers can extend  vertically from that.               50%  40%  30%  20%  10%  A  B  Depending on your needs and how abstract you want this line of  thinking to be, this reduction in ink can be taken quite far.   Candlestick chart   You might not have heard of a candlestick chart. Itʼs a very  specialized chart for financial data, but is basically a bar chart in  disguise. Knowing how a candlestick chart works could be useful,  because you might be asked to model some data which has similar  characteristics and, rather than reinvent the wheel, you can use  this bar chart derivation.   122  The candlestick chart was adopted around 1900 by Charles  Dow, founder of Dow Jones & Company and The Wall Street  Journal, and it has remained in the financial world ever since. Its  origins actually go back to the eighteenth century Japanese rice  market. However, it doesnʼt really matter how it started or where it  came from – knowledge of how the design works is the important  part.   $92  $91  $90  $89  $88  $87  1  The bar in this case represents the opening and closing prices  of the stock. Here, the stock on day one opened at $89.10 and  increased in value to $89.80. So the bar portion starts at a little  over 89 and continues just about up to 90. Thatʼs straightforward  and not unexpected in a bar chart. The whiskers, or wicks, that  extend up and down do not measure margin of error, but the  maximum and minimum selling price on that day. On day one the  lowest offer was not much lower than the opening price, whereas  the highest value was $91.00, significantly higher than the $89.90  closing price. Perhaps at some point in the day some great news  was released about the company, causing the price to rise.  But later, traders discovered that the news wasnʼt all it was cracked  up to be, so the price declined slightly back to around $90. Day four in the following chart shows something very   different. The opening value is $90.90, which follows from the  previous dayʼs closing, but the closing price for day four is $88.80,  much lower than $90.90. To represent this loss, the bar is coloured  in, either in black or any solid colour, whereas a gain is white or   no colour.   123  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Bar charts  $93  $92  $91  $90  $89  $88  $87  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  A candlestick chart provides an effective overview of the highs  and lows within a given period of time. It wonʼt describe every last  detail of what happened between the highs and lows, or precisely  when they occurred, but it does reveal a trend, something that  would be near impossible in a table.  Financial traders give special names to the patterns that   emerge from the different design possibilities: hammer; inverted  hammer; spinning top; and others. It isnʼt important to know  these names, but if you want to dig deeper into the history of  candlestick charts and their jargon, there are plenty of   resources online.   Histograms   Histograms have many of the same characteristics as bar charts,  but they have some significant properties of their own which  make them distinct.  A histogram represents frequency over a closed range.    Grades on a test, for example, must lie between zero and one  hundred per cent; every grade will fall along that line somewhere.    124  20  15  10  20  15  10  0%  25%  50%  75%  100%  Letʼs put each grade into one of four buckets: 0–25%, 26–50%,  51–75% and 76–100%. The height of the bar is the number of grades  in each bucket. This follows similar rules to bar charts except that  in a histogram the correct order is essential. It doesnʼt make sense  to place the 76–100% set first.  Histograms create an overall picture, quite often tending  towards a bell curve shape; there are a few people in the lower  groups, most in the middle, then trailing off again toward the  high end. Since the data consists of ranges and flows from one  container to the next, there are no gaps in the values and there  are no gaps in the chart. The bars are placed right next to each  other, sharing a vertical edge. Bar charts are illustrated with space  between the bars, but in a histogram they touch.  Another aspect of histograms, also because of their range   distribution, is that empty sets must be shown. The same sample  data, spread across ten buckets rather than four, might reveal a  completely different distribution.   0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90%  100%   125  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Bar charts  In this case, there were no grades between 51–60%. This could be  omitted in a bar chart, but in a histogram it is important to retain  and display the empty space. It contributes to the picture of the  data as a whole.   When data is in a continuous range with a fixed lower   and upper bound, a histogram is a useful way to present the  information.   The return of chart junk   Be aware that bar charts provide ample opportunities for chart  junk. The space within the bars is enticingly empty and it is  tempting to put images or textures in the background. Some  designers even swap out the standard bars for graphics. As  discussed in chapter 5, this is a bad idea – itʼs chart junk, plain and  simple. It adds no value to the data and distracts the reader from  the real story.    126  Star ratings   The most famous star rating has to be the one found in the  Michelin Guide in which restaurants are awarded one, two or three  stars. There is much to criticize about the awarding process, but as  a rating system it works well. So well in fact, that many other star  rating systems have appeared, from five star ratings for books and  movies, to hotel ratings systems. Even two thumbs up is a   rating system.  But how is a star rating related to a bar chart? If we think   about what a bar chart tells us, it has a maximum and minimum  value defined by the axis. The bar then extends through the space  and stops at the appropriate value. A star rating does something  very similar; think of it as a horizontal bar chart. The minimum  number of stars is zero and the maximum is either widely known,  or is shown as empty stars. The value of the ʻbarʼ is the number of  visible stars or stars that have been filled in.  0  1  2  3  4  5  The equivalent bar chart can be reduced in pixels almost to match  star ratings, but some things are implicit in star ratings that need  to be made explicit in a bar chart: namely, the scale values.  Star ratings rarely use anything besides whole and half stars, so it  makes the steps easy, whereas a bar chart can take any value and  therefore the step size must be displayed.  Star ratings also have the interesting quality of having fewer   characters than their text equivalent. When there is a single rating  value, it makes sense to simply display that. As weʼll see in chapter    127  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Bar charts  23 about gauges and thermometers, sometimes people feel it  necessary to explain one value by wrapping it in a large amount of  chart junk. If a movie received five stars, isnʼt it better to write “5  stars”? But thatʼs seven characters, whereas the Unicode star         written five times is two characters less and tells the same story.  Thatʼs something to think about when looking to reduce the data  to pixel ratio.  In several Unicode fonts, there are characters for a filled star   and an empty star. BLACK STAR  U+2605       and WHITE STAR   U+2606       can be used instead of images in your text, HTML and  documents. Not all fonts support these characters, but some of  the pre-installed ones do, such as MS Gothic and MS Mincho on  Windows and Apple Gothic on a Mac.  While star ratings have a limited range of use and are in   danger of being overused  and they can also cause confusion – do  only whole stars count or half stars as well? Whatʼs the maximum  to use? Can your eleven star rating map to my two thumbs up  system? , they are still a useful tool as long as you understand that  they are just a particular visual representation of a bar chart.    128   129  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Area graphs and charts  18  Area graphs and charts   If you are dealing with multiple data sources and you want to see  the data broken down by each item as well as the sum of all the  parts, then area graphs are the solution. There are area equivalents  of all our favourite charts, each providing both general totals and  particular results. They come in various guises: from stacked bar  charts and area graphs to area bar charts. In this chapter weʼll take  a look at some examples and how to use them.  Letʼs imagine three roadside stands: one selling lemonade;   one selling hamburgers; and a third selling fresh vegetables.  The stands are in place for the whole summer, a period of twelve  weeks. Each week, the vendors calculate their sales figures,  providing thirty-six data points to be plotted.   Since time is a factor, it makes most sense to plot time along   the x-axis and label the twelve weeks of summer, and on the  vertical axis to plot the three standsʼ sales figures. There are two  ways to achieve this. The first is a series of bar charts next to each  other. This follows everything we have learnt about bar charts  and good design. The grid is minimized, three distinct colours  are available, and the weeks are carefully spaced to make logical  groups and reduce the total pixel count.   400  300  200  100  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  Depending on the story we are trying to tell, this might be the  ideal representation. If you want to compare this yearʼs lemonade  income to last yearʼs, or compare vegetable sales to hamburger  sales in this summer period, bar charts in series work great.   130  Stacked bar charts    On the other hand, if you are more interested in seeing how  profitable this strip of highway is for roadside stands, you might  want to see the cumulative sales figures. To achieve this, the bars  from each chart are stacked on top of one another. This shows  not only the week with the greatest sales, but also which stand  contributed most to the total figure during any given week.   800  700  600  500  400  300  200  100              1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  Stacked bar charts describe totals while allowing a degree of  internal breakdown of the data. In this example, the overall  income from the sales is illustrated well, but only the first stacked  values  blue  can be accurately compared as they share a common  baseline. The middle and third stacked values  black and orange   never start at the same place, so it is harder to compare one weekly  value to another. The one advantage is that the order of the stack  can be swapped without changing the overall total.   Like regular bar charts, stacked bar charts can be illustrated   both vertically and horizontally. The orientation you choose  depends on the space available and the data being described. In our  example, sales are graphed over time. The convention is that time  is plotted horizontally, but if we were using a different variable,  such as location, then rotating the illustration so that location is    131  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Area graphs and charts  on the vertical y-axis and sales are plotted along the horizontal  x-axis is an acceptable design descision.   As we discussed in chapters 16 and 17 about line graphs   and bar charts, there are different situations when you might  choose one over the other. Line graphs show a continuous change  whereas bar charts represent a single point at a time. Since a bar  chart and a line graph demonstrate different attributes of the data,  the area equivalents of each also have particular purposes.  Area graphs  An area graph is usually a series of stacked line graphs. If we were  to take our roadside stand data and convert it from bar charts to a  series of line graphs, and then stack those to create an area graph,  we produce an effect similar to the stacked bar charts, in that total  sales over time can be seen.  800  700  600  500  400  300  200  100  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12   132  Area bar charts   Stacked bar charts take the existing data and stack it to reveal a  different perspective. Stacking the different bars creates something  equivalent to a pie chart. It visualizes the relative percentage  of each item in a particular week, but since the bars represent  absolute values rather than relative ones, we could keep   making these stacked bars for each week and compare them to   one another.   What if there was a way to get this relative view when the   values are stacked, but also encode a second variable? Since the  data sets are stacked, their shapes canʼt be changed to a star or  circle. But we can change the size in one dimension.  The stacked value for each week shows the total number of   units sold split into three sections. What if we also wanted to  display the profit margin? Selling 100 units of one product might  only make $1 profit on each one, whereas selling 50 units of  another product might generate $3 in profit each time for a total   of $150.    800  700  600  500  400  300  200  100  800  700  600  500  400  300  200  100  1  1  To represent this, each segment can be extruded as if it were a  horizontal bar chart – though we must be careful not to overload  the reader. Each axis must be carefully labelled and thereʼs a  danger that the display of the full twelve weeks will be cluttered.    133  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Area graphs and charts  Still, it is possible to present multiple variables in a stacked bar  chart – something that canʼt be done with an area graph. As soon  as further variables are added to a stacked bar chart it becomes  known as an area bar chart.  Those dotted pie chart wannabes   You know all those teenagers who rebel against conformity?  Yeah, those same ones that all dress the same and conform to this  nonconformist ideal. The same ones who, when you try to explain  this to them, get all frustrated and walk away in a huff.   Well, this next kind of area graph is just a pie chart in   disguise. It knew how bad pie charts really were  youʼll see what I  mean later  and didnʼt want to conform, so it went off and did its  own thing, thereby conforming to something just as ineffective.    This is an attempt at an area graph, but broken down into small  units, each representing a fixed number. Maybe each circle equals  one or ten or maybe a million: it doesnʼt matter. The chart purports  to show a percentage of a whole and an absolute count at the same  time. Rather than make the data sets flow into a bar chart or line  graph, the data is forced into odd shapes.   134  15%  3%  7%  75%  One advantage is that the dots are countable, but it also means that  the upper bound needs to be included. If you want to represent  75%, 7% and 3% you need 100 dots, but only 85 will be coloured  in. This helps to clarify that the dots represent percentage totals,  otherwise they are just 75, 7 and 3 units. By omitting the upper  bound, the chart is just a bar chart with kitchy chart junk.   135  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Area graphs and charts  Stream graphs   Stream graphs have emerged only recently. Their name stems from  their appearance: a river or stream of data pouring down or across  the graph. They have many of the attributes of an area graph, but  donʼt display them particularly well.  The first was created by information designers Lee Byron   and Martin Wattenberg in an example for last.fm in late 2006. A  little over a year later, The Washington Post worked with Byron and  Wattenberg to create a stream graph to display box office revenue1.  The data produced a beautiful twisting ribbon of the ebbs and  flows of a fickle publicʼs movie-going habits.   When you create a stream graph from a data set, your mileage   may vary. Here is some sample data which produces what looks  like a psychedelic slug trail rather than aiding understanding of  the data hidden within it.   1    http:  www.leebyron.com else streamgraph    136  Instead of having a zero line, the stream graph bubbles out from  the horizontal centre line. Where the stream goes below this  line, it isnʼt showing negative values: the whole stream is simply  realigned for that time period. Also, without a baseline, it is very  hard to figure out the scale and distance to calculate the area  delineated by the curves.  The graph below shows a slice of a thousand tweets from my   Twitter stream broken down by word and visualized as a   stream graph1.   Your Twitter stream will appear quite different; the variety of  words you use will affect how flowing and stream-like the design  is. Itʼs still not particularly readable or useful, but it is an example  of an area graph and itʼs worth understanding its limitations before  deciding to use one.   They create beautiful visualizations, a torrent of information   all flowing together, but stream graphs donʼt convey the data as  well as some alternatives. Any stream graph can be made into an  area graph by setting up a fixed baseline, so the data only grows in  one direction. The jury is still out on whether stream graphs will  prove worthwhile or can find a niche.   1    http:  www.neoformix.com Projects TwitterStreamGraphs view.php   137  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Area graphs and charts  Treemap  mosaic graph    A treemap is a relatively young chart type that has the ability to  show multi-variable information using both relative size and  colour. In 1990, Ben Shneiderman, a professor of computer science  at the University of Maryland, experienced the common problem  of running out of computer disk space. He wanted a way to  visualize the entire disk and see how much space was taken up by  each directory and subdirectory. To scratch this itch, Shneiderman  required a new type of graph and he invented treemaps out of the  necessity to better understand the data.   He has written more about his experiences and the thought  process on his website1.  In my research for this book, I found  a statistical atlas of the United States, published in 1870, which  contains what looks like an early treemap.   The concept, then, has been around for a long time and was  rediscovered and refined only recently.   A treemap has a defined area, usually rectangular, which   represents all of the data under examination. Itʼs similar to a pie  chart, but square. Each of the items being measured is allotted  a relative size within the larger rectangle. No matter how many   1     http:  www.cs.umd.edu hcil treemap-history index.shtml   138  smaller pieces are arranged inside, they can all fit within the larger  rectangle. This yields a tiled view of all the items relative in size  to each other. Given that they are also squares or rectangles, they  are rather easier to compare than round shapes. It is still difficult,  however, to compare lots of smaller values.   The advantage of a treemap is that you have plenty of boxes which  can contain information about a second variable. A good example  of this might be a book store. It can start with all the relevant  sections: history; politics; cooking; travel, and so on. The whole  box represents the total sales in a given quarter and each smaller  box within corresponds to one of these genres. We can quickly see  which have been the biggest sellers during that quarter, but we still  have the ability to layer on one more variable. In this case, it makes  sense to colour code the rectangles based on the rate of change. If a  box is shaded green, sales have increased since last quarter; if it is  red, sales have decreased. Of course, it is possible that everything  could be green, because sales could be up across the board! So,  weʼll have to think carefully about colour.  A treemap, much like a geographical map, canʼt express   changes over time unless multiple treemaps are used, or some  kind of animation moves from one treemap to the next.   139  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Area graphs and charts  In the interactive world, a treemap made up of categories of books  could be activated by the user, and then the selected category  becomes the full treemap and all the subcategories can be mapped  within it. Each of these in turn can be activated, revealing further  subcategories or individual books. Because each box in a treemap  is itself a small treemap, it is possible to drill down further and  further in a dynamic fashion.  A treemap may or may not be suitable for the data. Since a   treemap describes all of a data set, a pie chart could be used  weʼll  see in chapter 19 if this is a good idea . A stacked bar chart might  also be an option; this shows all of the data in a consistent width  bar for easy comparison, but if there are many items the bar chart  might extend a long way in just one direction. A treemap tends to  make all the areas within it square and therefore more compact. It  is not always possible, however, to show different parts of the data  in similar dimensions. This forces the reader to compare two areas  across the distance of the treemap which are drawn at dissimilar  ratios and sizes  the same applies to wedges of a pie chart .   One way to solve this is with the stacked bar chart, since the  dimensions for each item would be similar, but it doesnʼt solve  the issue of comparing two items over a large distance. The other  problem with a stacked bar chart is that the ability to display a  second variable represented by a different colour is lost. Putting  two bars next to each other with the same colour would make  them look as if they have merged into one; a unique colour for  each item represented is needed. For a small number of items this  is feasible, but a treemap excels at representing large volumes of  data and we know from chapter 9 that colour can be problematic.   140  Another potential way to respresent the data is a standard bar  chart. Each item would have its own bar of similar dimensions  and, because they are distinct, the second variable of colour  could be kept and comparing or reordering the bars accordingly is  straightforward. The advantage of the treemap over a bar chart is  that it saves space and similar items can be clustered together, but  comparison and labelling suffer in exchange for compactness.  Horizon graph   Horizon graphs are a kind of overlaid line graph. They are a  relatively new invention, so their usefulness is still undetermined,  and their strengths and weaknesses are still emerging. They were  developed by a data visualization company called Panopticon to  better visualize and compare several data sets over time, side by  side without overlapping them.   In our roadside stand example there are three separate   businesses, but what if there were thirty? Thirty bar charts per  week lined up next to each other would be too much. A stacked bar  chart gives us the total sales, but what if we wanted to compare  within each week? We could make a line graph for each store and  then plot all thirty on the same graph. That, too, would quickly  get overcrowded with information. As weʼve seen, once we exceed  about five or six, we start to run out of unique colours, shapes,  thicknesses and so on. Graphing thirty at once becomes a mess.               400  300  200  100  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12   141  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Area graphs and charts  400  300  200  100  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  This is the niche that horizon graphs are designed to fill. They are  basic line graphs split horizontally into a set number of bands.  This example uses four bands, but they can contain as many  as required. Each of the bands is coloured with an increasing  intensity of blue. So far, this is no different than a standard line  graph with some interesting shading.  The next part is the Eureka! moment. Since we are really only   interested in the outer edge of the line graph, why not collapse  each of the bands on top of each other to save space?  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  Now we have the same data presented in a quarter of the space.  By changing the colour of the shading, the graph appears to be  stacking up the parts. There is nothing hiding behind any of the  peaks so, unlike 3-D charts, nothing is being obscured.  This works with both positive and negative values.    Maybe in some weeks the shops were making a loss, which can   be represented with a different colour, such as varying intensities   of red.    142  400 300 200 100  -100 -200 -300 -400  Shop 27  Shop 28  Shop 29  Shop 30  1  1  2  2  3  3  4  4  5  5  6  6  7  7  8  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  Now you can rapidly see which weeks saw gains and which saw  losses, and at the same time also watch the line trend upwards   or downwards.   The horizon graph works really well when large numbers of  data sets need to be compared. Converting one line graph into a  horizon graph does save some space, but now that we have this  ribbon, we can stack more ribbons on top to get a quick view of all  the different shops and compare them in a limited space.   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  The downside of horizon graphs appears when the data sets are  very large. This example was broken down into only four colour  bands; this was sufficient to allow each to be distinct. The more  bands required, however, the more colours and the greater  potential for confusion. By limiting the number of divisions, each  band represents a larger portion of the data. To compare several  horizon graphs, their coloured bands need to represent the same  divisions; if they donʼt, the comparison will be difficult.   143  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Pie charts  19  Pie charts  I wonʼt hide the fact that I am not a fan of pie charts. They are the  scourge of the graph and charts world! They add little or no value  over a table of figures and can easily be misused to misrepresent  the data.  Even popular culture has latched on to their ridiculousness.   Sites like Graph Jam1 and Indexed2 are constantly making jokes  using pie charts.  One of the problems with pie charts is that the amount of data   they represent is very limited. The total value of the information  must add up to one hundred per cent and therefore a pie chart can  only represent relative amounts. If you remember, in chapter 12  we discussed the issues of relative data: comparing data across  sets is problematic because ten per cent of one data set can be a  vastly different absolute amount than ten per cent in another.  The most effective pie charts comprise only two items, such   as the percentage of male or female customers. If we introduce  more than two wedges, the eye must rotate at least one of the  wedges to a cardinal point to figure out the percentage value. With  only two wedges the angle is shared, making it easier to determine  the proportions of each.  If one side of the wedge follows a cardinal direction, then only the  arm of the angle which doesnʼt needs to be compared. When the  two values meet at the 12 oʼclock position, only the bottom half  needs to be examined to see how much more or less each value is  compared to the other. If the segments do not meet at a cardinal   1    graphjam.com 2    thisisindexed.com   144  point, then it is more difficult to calculate the angle and estimate  the values. The reader is forced to rotate the chart so that one line  is perpendicular and then work out the angle.  I  t  e  m     8  :    2  0  %  I t  e  m     7 :    2  %  Ite m 1: 24 %  Item 6: 18%  %  m  5: 7  It e  It e  m   2: 5  %  I t  e  m     3  :    9  %  % 5 1   : 4   m e t  As soon as you have to compare more than two values, you run  into trouble. As the number of wedges increase, the percentages  get smaller and smaller, and therefore their size decreases. More  colours are needed to uniquely identify each segment. As the chart  gets more and more cluttered, it becomes necessary to label not  only what the wedges represent but also their values. At this point,  you have pretty much recreated some tablular data with a ugly dot  in the middle, not to mention that you are now using more space  and more pixels than just a list. What extra value is gained from  the visual aspects of the pie chart? Relative sizes perhaps, but when  they are all thin slivers of tiny percentages differentiated only at    145  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Pie charts  the decimal point, does the chart tell a story or is it just eye candy?  Can you remove it and have nothing change?   100% or bust!   The values displayed in a pie chart must represent all the answers  for a single question. This might sound obvious, but there have  been pie charts broadcast on television which add up to more than  one hundred per cent. This is impossible! If you have reached this  outcome, then you obviously have a problem.  This mistake is probably attributable to the survey consisting   of three separate questions that became illustrated in the wrong  type of chart. The people polled were asked about their opinion on  several topics and responded to each.  42%  21%  68%   	 Q1: Would you support Candidate 1 if he ran for office?  yes no   	 Q2: Would you support Candidate 2 if she ran for office?  yes no   	 Q3: Would you support Candidate 3 if he ran for office?  yes no   Instead of making three pie charts, one for each question, the ʻyesʼ  counts for all three questions were put into a single pie chart.  Since the questions were discrete, the values of the answers donʼt  add up to one hundred per cent. In these instances, a pie chart  isnʼt the correct way to display the data: it just doesnʼt make sense!    146  Doughnut chart   Iʼd like to meet the person who thought that a doughnut chart  was a good idea. Someone took a pie chart with all its failings and  then had the brilliant idea to cut the middle out! Now, it does save  on ink, so that is one thing in its favour, but it offers absolutely  nothing more than the pie chart.   I wonder if it was once added into a software package as a feature  and it stuck. It is hard to remove features once they are in there,  and as soon as one package had doughnut charts, everyone had to  have doughnut charts. Sometimes itʼs better to have fewer choices  and focus on the charts that best convey the story. A doughnut  chart is not one of these.  By removing the centre of a pie chart, it further hinders the   ability to judge the weight of each segment. Moving from a healthy  wedge to two arcs makes it harder for people to comprehend what  value is represented. We know that a full pie chart is one hundred  per cent and that any wedge is a fraction of that; if we are presented  with only an arc, is it equivalent to the wedge, or is it less because  it is missing a portion?  Here the full wedge represents 45% compared to just the   arc which also represents 45%. But the volume is very different  between them. Are they really equal?  If you create doughnut charts after reading this, Iʼll hunt       you down!    147  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Pie charts  Stacked pie charts   The doughnut chart might well have emerged after the invention  of the stacked pie chart. The intention here was to create  concentric rings of overlapping wedges to show some sort of data  comparison. For example, an inner pie chart could represent the  percentage of regional growth in the first quarter and an outer pie  chart shows percentage growth in the second quarter. Letʼs have a  look at why this is poor design for pie charts.  First, parts of the lower pie chart are necessarily obscured  by placing the second chart on top. And if the inner pie chart is  removed to leave the area empty we are back to the doughnut.   You can quickly see how difficult it is to compare the two rings.  Only the first and last wedges are anchored to the same angle; the  light-green inner wedge can easily be compared to the outer blue  because they both start at the same place. In the outer ring, the  blue wedge is much bigger, though a reader still needs to estimate  how much bigger. But how much larger is the outer blue wedge  compared to the purple one on the other side of the inner pie  chart? It is very hard to tell because they donʼt share a common  starting point or even a common side. First, the purple wedge  must be rotated until it reaches the same starting place, and then  we can estimate its difference to the previous wedge. This is very  complicated and could easily be avoided using a different type    of chart.    148  100%  70%  50%              The same relative values in a pie chart can easily be converted  to a stacked bar chart without losing any data and increasing  readability.  Secondly, stacking pie charts leaves you with more design   questions than answers. When one set of represented data overlaps  another, how much should be left exposed? How thick should the  outer ring be?  A pie chart is designed so that the area of the wedge represents   a percentage. When a hole is punched in the middle, the relative  percentages of what is left remain the same; since each wedgeʼs  area was reduced by the same relative amount, nothing changes.  However, if we now compare the inner pie chartʼs wedges with  those of the outer pie chart, the arc might be similar, but the area  is not.    149  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Pie charts  The circle on the left in the figure above has a radius of 50 pixels.  Using the formula πr2 we can work out the area of the circle: in  this case 50 × 50 × 3.14 = 7,850 pixels. The ring on the right has  a radius of 70.71 pixels. Square that and multiply by pi: 15,700 –  twice as much as with a radius of 50 pixels. The white cut-out is  the area of the black circle; the shaded black areas are equal, but  youʼd never realize just by looking. It doesnʼt mean youʼre bad at  geometry, itʼs just that human brains arenʼt optimized for figuring  out area. When layering pie charts not only are the arcs hard to  compare, but also the pixels.   3-D and perspective   With the advent of computer-aided design, fewer and fewer  people sit down at a draftsmanʼs table and create with a pencil  an isometric mechanical drawing or blueprint. Now, Iʼm not  advocating a return to this analog technology, but some aspects of  three-dimensional drawing that once had to be taught are now had  for free with a computer.  A perfect example is the perspective vanishing point. This is   the point on the horizon that all the 3-D lines lead back to.  Vanishing Point   150  When building 3-D pie charts, there is also a vanishing point.  This skews the shape of the pie.  Vanishing Point  Vanishing Point  So even though the wedges closest to and furthest away from us  are the same value, they are very different shapes and sizes. This  is not ideal when trying to explain the values with as little bias as  possible.   Projecting a pie chart in this way gives an arbitrary height   to the closer wedges, thereby adding more pixels to their weight  without actually adding more value into their count.  Now, you might be thinking, who would ever go this far to  trick the reader? Well, thereʼs a great article called “Lies, Damn  Lies and Steve Jobs keynotes” by Jack Schofield in The Guardian  newspaper1. In the article, Schofield highlights the Apple keynote  in which Steve Jobs explained how well the sales of the iPhone  were coming along. He used the Keynote® presentation software,  which allows for crazy 3-D pie charts.  1    http:  www.guardian.co.uk technology blog 2008 jan 21 liesdamnliesandstevejobs   151  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Pie charts  As you can see, there are six wedges; sales of the iPhone are  illustrated by the green wedge that has been pulled away from the  rest. Since the pie chart is displayed in three dimensions on a flat  screen, the data appears distorted. The front part of the pie chart  looks closer and therefore larger than the back. Conveniently,  Appleʼs 19.5% share is at the front, making it look significantly  bigger than the 21.2% in the back, which is larger in value, but  smaller in pixels.  There is no doubt that the design of this pie chart was   conceived to intentionally mislead the viewer. Three-dimensional  projects make this very easy to accomplish and, once you realize  this, you will begin to see it everywhere.  A simple, more truthful solution would be to convert this pie   chart into a simple bar chart.  RIM  39%   Other  21.2%   Apple  19.5%   Palm  9.8%   Motorola  7.4%   Nokia  3.1%   This solves the issues of colour, scale, size, proximity and labels.  It isnʼt as flashy and colourful, but it more accurately reflects the  reality of the situation.   Highlighting specific data   As discussed in chapter 7, there are several different ways to  highlight a subset of the data to draw more attention to it. There  are a few techniques that can be used when dealing with pie  charts, such as colour, location and shape.   152  To highlight just one region, it is possible to mute or remove all the  colours except on the single wedge under consideration. It is also  possible to explode the pie chart and pull one of the pieces away  from the circle. By moving the location, even slightly, the brain  makes a distinction.  Even though Iʼve tried to convince you why 3-D pie charts are  inappropriate, perhaps youʼre determined  or obliged  to use  them. If so, then it is possible to extend the shape of the wedge  vertically so that it is taller than the other pieces. This isnʼt  recommended because of all the distortion issues of 3-D objects in  two dimensions. Furthermore, in chapter 11 we talked about how  to deceive with data and that 3-D objects take up a greater volume  and therefore assume a greater value than what ought to  be represented.   At this point, I hope I have demonstrated how pie charts are  often more of a hindrance than a help. Their shape, the amount  of data they can encode, the number of variables: all are very  restrictive. Even though the pie chart is a very common chart,   you shouldnʼt pick it out of your designer tool box too often. As  weʼll see next, however, there are a few situations in which a round  chart style does excel.   153  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Pie charts  Pie charts and time   There are a few instances where a circular chart is useful. The best  example is when we are discussing time and clocks. It is possible  to use our knowledge of a clock face and adapt a pie chart so  instead of expressing one hundred per cent of something, it can  represent portions of twelve or twenty-four hours.  Noon  8am  Closed  5pm  As a circular diagram, it is easy to understand that the store is  open from 8am to 5pm, but a problem arises when the opening  hours need to be extended. What would a circular diagram look  like if you were open from 8am to 10pm? Now you have an overlap!  If you are going to use this technique instead of a simple table of  opening and closing times, youʼd better do it right!   154  Monday - Friday  12  Saturday  12  Sunday  12  9  3  9  3  9  3  6  6  6  LEGEND  High Volume  Mild Volume  Low Volume  Closed  IKEA used these circular clock face diagrams to explain its opening  hours and the customer traffic levels; this allowed shoppers  to decide when to visit the store based on how many other  customers were there.  There are several problems dealing with the  psychology of publishing this information and how it affects the  decisions of the shoppers, but thatʼs another book entirely.    If we look at the IKEA examples, theyʼre a good first start. The diagrams make use of our knowledge of the clock face to  represent opening times. So far so good, but the labelling could  be confusing. Is ʻ6ʼ, 6am or 6pm? On Saturday, what time does  the store open? You could assume 9am, but then the graph isnʼt  actually telling you a story: you are just jumping to a conclusion.  There is an easy solution to fix some of these ambiguities:  convert the round clock-like chart into a horizontal stacked bar  chart. Time is read from left to right, so nothing is lost in the  conversion. We now know when the shop opens – thatʼs the  leftmost point – and weʼve relabelled “12” as “noon”. Using the 24- hour clock is another alternative.   155  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Pie charts  Monday - Friday  10  11  noon  Saturday  Sunday  9  9  9  10  11  noon  10  11  noon  1  1  1  2  2  2  3  3  3  4  4  4  5  5  5  6  6  6  7  7  7  8  8  8  9  9  9  Roll out those circles   Any pie chart can be converted into a much more useful and  readable stacked bar chart. When a pie chart seems to be a bad  idea, it can be ʻrolled outʼ into something better. Imagine rolling  the wheel of the pie chart and leaving a trace on the ground. The  length of that line is equivalent to the circumference of the wheel.  Donʼt worry, no maths needed here.   156              A = 2,000 B = 3,000 C = 500 D = −300 E = 2,300  Now we can see the portions of the pie chart as relative rectangular  lengths. This rolled out pie chart still shows all the data, and the  pieces within it are much easier to compare and reorder without  having to do any mental rotation of the wedges.   Who ate my pie?   One situation in which a pie chart completely falls down is with  negative numbers. Letʼs say a large corporation wants to create a  pie chart of its annual income, broken down by each division. If  there are five divisions, what would a pie chart look like if their  incomes were as follows?  This is very easy to represent as a bar chart, because values below  zero can be drawn; as a pie chart, it is almost impossible. All of  the profits can be represented, but how is division Dʼs loss  accounted for? A pie wedge canʼt overlap another to demonstrate  negative income.  Microsoftʼs Excel simply plots the negative value as positive   in a pie chart, but labels it as negative. Dealing with this issue is so  problematic, however, that it is best to just avoid it altogether by  selecting a more appropriate chart type.   Decagraph   If you must use a pie chart, then you should consider a decagraph.  It follows the exact same rules as a pie chart, but instead of having  a circular border, its shape is that of a decagon – a ten-sided figure.  This has the advantage of each corner representing ten per cent.    157  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Pie charts  Every wedge is somewhere between these ten per cent markers,  making it easier to gauge the correct value.  I donʼt know many charting applications that have decagraphs  among their default options, but it is something to consider when  designing and developing your own charts. Adding corners to a  circle adds more information and can remove pixels.  Sexagesimal ~ http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Sexagesimal  Weʼre all familiar with base-10 counting systems; our ten fingers and ten toes, plus the Arabic  numeral system, make it an obvious and powerful method of calculation. Youʼre probably also  aware of base-16 when you deal with hex colours on the web: FF = 255, A0 = 160 and so on. In  chapter 10 we looked at how to convert base-10 into base-16 when using Dopplrʼs colouring  algorithm. A computerʼs logic uses base-2 with ones and zeros. From binary we can build up very  complex systems.  Sexagesimal is base-60. This might seem strange and in no way useful, but humans have used   it in various forms for thousands of years, most notably on the clock face.  Sexagesimal systems can be divided by whole numbers in twelve different ways. The factors  are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30 and 60. This means that you can take any of those values and  divide them into 60 and get a whole number back. There are sixty minutes in an hour, and it can be  divided into twelve sections of five, to mark the twelve hours in each half of the day. We often refer  to quarter-hours, since each hour can be divided into four fifteen-minute portions.  Old coins and armband jewellery were also ridged and broken into these units. A coin that   has twelve bits can be split between two, three, four and six people evenly. Base-60 sounds  complicated, but it makes for a very flexible system when dividing goods, services and time  between groups of various sizes.   158  Encoding a second variable   A pie chart depicts a list of items and their relative percentage  values; thatʼs only one variable per item. When we look for ways to  add a second variable for each wedge, we quickly hit a wall.   Since each wedge in a pie chart is unique and touching its   immediate neighbours, distinct colours are needed for each one. If  not, we run the risk of juxtaposed wedges sharing the same colour  and it being impossible to tell where one starts and the other stops.  Weʼve also previously investigated other ways to encode additional  variables with limited success.  Company Departments by Gender  It is possible to put a chart on a chart, but that is just a disaster  waiting to happen. The only good solutions to encoding a second  variable in pie charts are extending the wedges in two dimensions,  or something called a belt chart. Weʼll discuss extending the  wedges in chapter 22 when we discuss polar area charts.  Belt chart  A belt chart is a series of concentric rings, each ring representing  a percentage of the area of the previous, inner ring – it is almost  as confusing as it sounds. For example in the charts below,  the innermost white circle represents all of the participants  in the Olympics. In the left chart, the next ring out represents    159  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Pie charts  the proportion of participants from each of the five populated  continents  North America, South America, Australia, Africa and  Eurasia – hence the five rings in the Olympic symbol . We can then  move to the outer ring to see the gender breakdown by continent.  Adding up all the women participants by continent would give the  total of women participants in the Olympics. Each ring represents  a different statistic, but remains related to the overall percentage.  This isnʼt a true second variable, like funding per nation; for that  weʼd need to look into 2-D wedge scaling.   As you can see, this example ends up looking like a psychedelic  poker chip! We can go on and on too. Imagine a third ring, where  each of the blue or pink wedges would be broken down by age,  which itself could have a fourth ring, and so on.    The order is not important, although itʼs easier to focus on  one aspect above another. As we can see on the right, our first  ring could have been gender, so there is only one pink and one  blue wedge. The second ring shows the breakdown by continent,  displaying two red, blue, green, yellow and black wedges, one each  for males and females. It all depends on the story you want to tell.  Much like the treemap, each inner segment or arc represents   the total of its outer children, so it is possible to drill down into  each section to get another view. In the treemap this characteristic  would need to be animated or displayed on a separate chart, as    160  otherwise the data gets cluttered with tiny boxes, each with a  border to keep its data contained. With the radial tree chart this is  achieved by adding another ring. Each ring is a breakdown of what  is inside the parent.  Just looking at this diagram makes my eyes hurt. I can see how  many rings deep the structure is and see plenty of tiny slivers at  the edges, but I canʼt make any logical comparisions. Looking at the  inner segments, the red one makes up perhaps thirty per cent of  the total. As we move outward, most of what makes up that thirty  per cent is four levels deep. The size of that block is much larger at  the fourth level than the first, yet it represents less information.  This means that you canʼt compare a wedge in one level to a wedge  in another. You need to first figure out what percentage that wedge  shows in its ring, then look at the other wedge, figure out what  percentage that shows in its ring, and only then compare the two.  At this point, youʼre better off looking it up in a table.   Dealing with a circular visualization and trying to compare its  radial portions is always problematic. When designing with data,  the story should always be told as clearly as possible. To do so, it is  often best to avoid round charts and graphs.   161  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Scatter plots  20  Scatter plots   Scatter plots are a useful tool to reveal relationships between any  amount of independent values. A scatter plot is like a line graph,  but without the connecting lines. The data points are placed in a  grid in an attempt to build a larger picture.  Two values that correlate well in life are age and height.   You start your early years small and grow until you reach your  adult height.    220cm  t h g i e H  1,000 km  a e r A  0  0  0  0  Age  30  This creates a nice trend line because age and height have a  relationship, but not everything does. For instance, we can take  the square kilometers of a countryʼs area and its population.  Density  30%   162  Some countries have a very dense population per square  kilometer and some do not. There are some countries with a large  population and large area, some countries with a large area and  low population, and some with high population and low area and  everything in between. There is no general trend line.  This is just fictitious data; with proper information, a trend   might be found, or an ideal zone that few countries break out of. If  conditions get too bad in any one country, people might emigrate  and so reveal a critical point. Also, this chart wonʼt be complete  until the data points are labelled; the chart isnʼt that interesting  until we know whoʼs who.   These sorts of scatter plots have their origin at zero, since all  the values are positive numbers. But itʼs possible to create graphs  that extend past the zero point in both directions. Some people  might call this a Cartesian coordinate system; some people might  just call this a table: for simplicity, letʼs call it a matrix.  Matrix   This matrix is a two-dimensional grid that extends in both  positive and negative directions from the origin. It provides a two- dimensional space to plot data.  -10  10  10  0  0  -10   163  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Scatter plots  It could extend into a third dimension to represent a third  variable, but such a diagram could become confusing and difficult  to understand.  When building a matrix, itʼs important to put opposed   attributes at each end of the axes. This is straightforward when  dealing with numbers – you can go right to positive 10 and left to  negative 10 – but non-numerical information can be displayed  too. Letʼs take a look at a matrix presenting potential vacation  options.  On your vacation you could visit locations nearby or you   could travel further away. Against that we could plot the strengths  of local currencies, but that is just a numeric scale like −10 to  +10. Instead weʼll plot distance against the complexities of travel  paperwork and visas.  Paper Hassle  -10  10  Easy Paperwork  The left side of the matrix, labelled ʻnearʼ, represents potential  holiday spots close to home. On the opposite side of this is ʻfarʼ.  Only you can judge what these terms mean and which locations  are too near or far to be close to the sweet spot at the centre.    164  Maybe it isnʼt distance thatʼs at stake here, but rather the time it  takes to get somewhere. This gives you a range of places to visit  based on perceived distance and travel time.  Paper Hassle  Near  Far  Easy Paperwork  Based on simple distance, New York could be considered near  Quebec, London near Moscow, Tokyo close to Beijing, Jerusalem  near Cairo – but each of these cities might cause different  paperwork headaches for the traveller. At the far end of the  spectrum, assuming a start point of London, UK, far away places  might included Sydney, Australia or Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. While  both of these cities are distant, there could be direct flights from  London making them straightforward to visit, so they arenʼt placed  as far away on the matrix.  Now we need to add in the second variable, the bureaucratic  hassle while youʼre preparing for your trip. This is based on your  nationality, your passport status, health precautions and how strict  each country is about tourists. At the top of the matrix weʼll place  countries with stringent criteria and at the bottom those which are    165  A Practical Guide to Designing with data              more relaxed. Starting from London, if your destination is a city  within the UK, then the data point can be put at the very bottom,  since you donʼt have to check your passport or deal with visas –  though public transport might be a factor in the distance stakes!  Within the European Union member states, citizens can   travel relatively easily, so a trip from London to Paris is both close  and very relaxed. The data point for Paris can go in the lower-left  quadrant. Alternatively, travelling from London to New York City  involves a regular seven-hour flight, so it might be placed just  within the near category, but for non-US citizens there can be a  mountain of paperwork to fill out before arriving. Therefore, New  York could be put in the upper-left quadrant: it is relatively close,  but has strict rules for tourists.  From London  Paper Hassle  Antarctica  New York, USA  Near  Far  Sydney, Australia  Paris, France  Easy Paperwork  A further-flung destination such as Sydney, Australia is  straightforward for a British citizen to visit. Therefore, Sydney  finds itself in the lower-right quadrant: it is far away, but has  relaxed rules for British tourists. The last quadrant might be filled  with more exotic places like Antarctica – as a scientific base,    166  visiting as a tourist would require a few questions to be answered!  Travelling to some South American or Asian countries will require  a raft of vaccinations. Such places would be put into the upper- right quadrant: far away and a hassle.  Now, rather than just a list of potential destinations and their   paperwork requirements, we have plotted them on to a matrix,  making it much easier to see the outliers and any clusters.  We can also see if there are any areas which are empty or  completely ignored.  Anyone working on a business plan has probably done  something similar with a SWOT analysis  Strengths versus  Weaknesses, Opportunities versus Threats . By placing strengths  and weaknesses on one scale, threats and opportunities on the  other, almost any scenario can be plotted into the matrix and  ideally help build a better company.  Itʼs also useful to use matrices to plot a company against its  competitors. If a company finds itself in the low end market and  unpopular, it might want to adjust its brand image to make its  products more popular. By plotting all of the competition into a  matrix, itʼs possible to work out who needs to be imitated or how a  company can differentiate itself.   Luxury  Hard to pay for luxury with cheap  tickets  Competition  Competition  Limos and lounges  E x p e n s i v e  e v i s n e p x e n I  1p deals  No competition   for  expensive seats  Commodity   167  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Scatter plots  It can also be a good indicator of gaps in the market. Maybe no  one is catering to the low-end market and someone could move  in and grab a portion of the revenue. The airline industry could  plot expensive versus inexpensive and luxury versus commodity.  Some airlines pick up their customers in a limousine, offer lounge  access and treat passengers like royalty; these airlines would sit  in the high luxury high price quadrant of the matrix. Then there  are plenty of companies in the low quality low price quadrant.   Weʼve all probably been suckered into their one penny deals! The  old adage rings true: you get what you pay for.  There are probably  very few companies that are expensive and low quality. The sweet  spot is an ideal amount of luxury compared to price. Most airlines  would probably fall inside the two curves.   Nolan chart   The Nolan chart is a very specific type of scatter plot matrix. It is  used to determine political standing and plots economic freedom  against personal freedoms. Really, though, a Nolan chart is just a  scatter plot under a different name with a single purpose.   Left-wing  m o d e e r f   l a n o s r e P    T ot  P  o  p  alit aria ulist n   Lib  e rt a  ria  n  Right-wing  Economic    168  Bubble chart   So far weʼve looked at a scatter plot as a matrix comparing two  variables. These get encoded in into the axes as positive and  negative numbers or attributes. But what if we wanted to  explore encoding more variables – maybe price, luxury and  a third: availability.   The bubble chart is a specific type of scatter plot that makes  use of size to encode a third variable. Each data point is mapped  onto the axes and then the size of each point is scaled up or down  depending on the third variable.   With a small set of data, it becomes immediately apparent  which of the values is the largest, but when the set increases in  size, the chart could become cluttered with overlapping data  points, with larger dots covering or obscuring smaller ones,  affecting the interpretation of the values.    l  1   e b a i r a V  0  0  Variable 3: Size  Variable 2  This type of chart might be called a bubble chart, but the third  variable need not be a bubble. In chapter 7 we discussed several  ways to draw attention to particular items of data and we can use  these ideas again here. We could try different shapes for each data  point, different colours, or different sizes. Itʼs also possible to  make combinations of colour and shape to encode fourth and fifth  variables. But be warned: youʼll soon be treading on the thin ice of  chart junk.    169  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Scatter plots  0  0  Variable 2  l  1   e b a i r a V  l  1   e b a i r a V  Variable 3: Colour  Variable 3: Shape  0  0  Variable 2  Some practitioners have taken the bubble chart and made it  dynamic by including time – they call this a motion chart – to  form an animated series of bubble charts. The most famous  examples come from Hans Rosling, a Swedish Professor of  International Health and Director of the Gapminder Foundation.  Using bubble charts, he has mapped out multiple variables    170  such as child mortality, GDP and population. When put together  into a motion chart, the fourth variable, time, makes for a very  interesting show1. The bubbles grow and shrink, and move around  the matrix; as countries get wealthier, their child mortality drops  and their populations increase. Static bubble charts and scatter  plots can only provide one frame of this animation at a time,  whereas the motion chart tells a much more interesting story.   Summary   You now know much more about the basic types of charts found in  most applications. The perennial line graph, bar chart, area chart,  pie chart and scatter plot have all been examined and explained in  great detail. They were once just tiny icons in a sea of options, but I  hope that you now know a lot more about which is appropriate for  your data and when.  In the final section, weʼre going to look at some less common  charts and graphs. These are lumped together for several reasons.  In some cases they are uncommon because they have quite specific  purposes, in others because they are difficult to use correctly, or  just difficult to immediately comprehend as a chart. The purpose  of walking through these more unusual charts is to spark some  new ideas and encourage you to break away from the common  types of charts.  Now that you know how to use the regular graphs and charts,  itʼs time to push the boundaries a bit and see what else is possible.              1    http:  www.ted.com talks hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen.html                     Part 5  Not so common  charts   So far, weʼve talked about the history of charts and graphs, issues of  colour and ink, the ability to mislead with data and some common  types of charts and graphs. Now I want to talk about some of the less  common types. They are less common not because they are poorly  designed; as we saw, pie charts are popular even though their design  often fails to convey the information properly. Rather, these less  usual charts have gone mostly unnoticed or are used for very specific  purposes. By introducing them here, I hope to make you aware of  certain problems to avoid in your own designs and show you other  interesting opportunities to illustrate your data.    Maps, choropleths and cartograms   Radar plots    Sound                                           Gauges and thermometers    Everything and the kitchen sink               173  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Maps, choropleths and cartograms  21  Maps, choropleths and cartograms   You probably donʼt think of maps as charts or graphs, but  they do serve as a very specific type. Much like grids and axes  define boundaries on a line graph, a map defines geographical  boundaries into which the rest of the data flows.  We can take a table of place names, latitudes and longitudes  and plot them on a map. Think of this in the same way you would  with an X and Y plot.   Name  Edinburgh  Newcastle  Manchester  Cardiff  London  Latitude  55 56'58"N   54 58'N   53 28'N   51 29'07"N   51 30'29"N   Longitude  3 9'37"W   1 36'W   2 14'W   3 11'12"W   0 7'29"W   Edinburgh  Newcastle  Manchester  Cardiff  LONDON  For geographical data sets, a map is an obvious choice. If you are  exploring weather data, earthquake information, postal code  mapping, or other geographically specific information, plotting it  to latitude and longitude makes sense, but you need to be aware of  a few drawbacks.    174  Scaling   The scale of a map can cause problems when large and small areas  are compared simultaneously. On a map of the US, the smaller  New England states tend to be exploded and scaled up just to make  sure their data is visible when compared to the map of the rest of  the country. The political boundaries on a map can also become  problematic when scaled. A border that is one pixel in width is fine  when the output is very large, but as it gets smaller, that one pixel  border takes up a larger proportion of the overall design, leading  to clutter and confusion. We discussed the data to pixel ratio in  chapter 6, as well as some ways to lighten up the grid lines, all of  which also applies to map borders.  Sometimes scaling cannot be avoided, but there are options   other than exploding a part of the map to an inset box at a different  scale. Different map projections can be explored.  Map projections   A map projection is a method of transposing a three-dimensional  surface, such as that of the Earth, into two dimensions. Maps of  the Earth come in many well-known projections, from Mercator to  Buckminster Fullerʼs famous Dymaxion, Albers to sinusoidal. Each  attempt to solve the problem of mapping three dimensions to two  has advantages and drawbacks, but sometimes maps are distorted  for other reasons.    Dymaxion projection   175  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Maps, choropleths and cartograms  Worldmapper1 creates maps where each country is resized and  reshaped in accordance with a particular variable. The more  distorted the shape of the country is, the higher or lower the value.  The example below shows population density. The more people  within the countryʼs borders, the greater the distortion.  When the regions of a map are distorted in order to convey  more meaning, this is referred to as a cartogram. It is a specific  type of map data design.    Copyright 2009 SASI Group  University of Sheffield   Like the issues around comparing the sizes of pie chart wedges   see chapter 19 , relative national landmass areas cannot be judged  accurately without a comparison to the original map. If the change  is only slight, then it might be unnoticeable, but if the scale wasnʼt  known in the first place, how can the change be understood? If a  large country such as Brazil was increased in size by 1.2% would  the difference be noticeable? If so, could anyone tell that it was  1.2% rather than 1%? Probably not. Even when the change is large  and obvious, a 400% increase will still be difficult to distinguish   1     http:  www.sasi.group.shef.ac.uk worldmapper    176  from a 378% increase. These sorts of distortions work well as a  visual effect, but not for conveying actual statistical data.  When we zoom into smaller regions within maps, they too are  distorted on purpose. Have you ever really looked closely at a map  of your city? Some features are emphasized and others reduced in  importance, but this is acceptable because such maps are designed  for specific purposes more than for geographic accuracy. A map is  not a satellite photograph.  Cloudmade.com & Openstreetmap.org   177  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Maps, choropleths and cartograms  Take street widths, for instance. Street maps display different  kinds of streets at different line widths. These are not to scale by  any means, but we tend not to worry that main thoroughfares are  wider on the map and side streets are smaller, while retaining  their correct positions on the map. Streets are not scaled based on  their physical size, but instead based on the type of thoroughfare.  This distortion helps the reader understand which streets are the  major and minor roads by their representation on the map.  There are other reasons that some maps ʻlieʼ about the real  world to aid comprehension in the viewer. A perfect example of  this is the famous London Underground map. It is not laid out  with geographical accuracy, but instead is based on the relative  position of the stations. While we might think this is a somewhat  new and unusual idea – Harry Beckʼs map was drawn in 1931 and  first published in 1933, less than a century ago – it goes back a     lot further.  Station  Station  Station  In 1804, the American West was newly purchased from France  and the US government needed to know precisely what it had  bought. President Jefferson selected US Army Captain Meriwether  Lewis to lead the expedition to explore the new territory. Fellow  soldier William Clark joined the expedition at Lewisʼs request. The  Lewis and Clark expedition was the first overland expedition to  explore the new territory in search of the Pacific Ocean, mapping    178  as it went. Sacagawea and other Native American Indians helped  Lewis and Clark travel across this new land by guiding them and  supplying local maps of their areas.  Lewis and Clark found the maps the Native Americans   provided very confusing. They were quite unlike the European  maps the surveyors were used to, consisting of landmarks placed  relative only to each other. Travelling down a river, the Native  Americans were worried less about the turns and bends it might  make than about the landmarks they passed. These markers  formed the basis of navigation. Similarly, when travelling on the  London Underground, the New York City subway or other mass- transit systems, a passenger needs to know how many stations lie  between their starting station and their intended destination, and  where to change lines rather than the precise geographical location  of either.  Once you have chosen your map projection, you need to lay   out the grid in which your data will flow. Maybe the data is just the  landmarks on the map. In that case, youʼre finished, but maybe  you have additional data about each region which needs to be  displayed.                179  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Maps, choropleths and cartograms  Applying a single data variable to a map   Single variable data corresponds to one value. For instance, if you  want to show which of the US states voted Republican  red  or  Democratic  blue , it is a simple binary decision. A given region  can be turned on or off by filling in the boundary with a single  colour. While the colours blue and red were chosen because  they represent the two parties, the same information could be  displayed with ink and no ink.  Applying a single variable to a map is the simplest way to start,  but the world is rarely black and white: rather, it is many shades  of grey. The next step, then, is to create a gradient of colour for the  data to represent a sliding scale of values, and develop a range of  colours between red and blue at varying intensities. The purpler  the state, the more it was a mixture. It is usually best, however,  to use shades of grey from pure black to pure white stepped in  between for all the reasons discussed in chapter 9. People with  colour-blindness will see this map in similar shades of the same  colour. When this illustration is printed in black and white, all  the beautiful shades of colour become a diluted grey. It becomes    180  impossible to tell the difference between a light red and a light  blue when both values are represented in greyscale. The data  becomes unreadable and therefore useless to the reader.  The major downside to using a gradient is that it is difficult to  distinguish 83% grey from 80% grey. Sometimes itʼs useful to group  the data into discrete blocks  for example, 100–80%, 79–60%,  59–40%, 39–20%, 19–0% . This has the advantage of clarifying the  colour distinctions, but some fine-grained nuances can be lost. By  increasing the number of discrete blocks the granularity can be  increased, but so can the potential for confusion. Depending on  the data, somewhere will be a sweet spot balancing the two, with a  few unique colours while still creating enough buckets to describe  the data.  Maps that have specific colour-coded regions are referred  to as choropleths. Choropleths can be used in conjuction with  cartograms and other map styles and projections.  In chapter 9, we discussed the use of colour and a few tips and  tricks about what is good and bad. It applies as much to maps as to  charts and graphs.  There are other ways besides colour to represent a range of   data. Take weather, for instance; it could be sunny, cloudy, raining,  snowing, thundery, and so on. This could work in a very similar  way to a gradient of colours, as there is a range of possible values  which each area falls into. Instead of discrete blocks of colour,  however, different icons representing each type of weather are    181  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Maps, choropleths and cartograms  placed on the map as a graphical way to represent information.  The weather icons could be replaced with colours – green for  rain, red for sun, blue for snow, yellow for clouds – but the  choice of colours would be arbitrary and not necessarily make  sense. Similarly, the Republican and Democratic areas could be  represented with some sort of icon.  If itʼs not desirable or possible to use a map, you can display  geographic data in a list or table. When creating lists, they need to  be ordered somehow: alphabetically; numerically by temperature;  or by other factors under consideration. A map removes the need  to order the values because latitude and longitude underpin   their placement.  Name  Edinburgh  Newcastle  Manchester  Cardiff  London  Weather  Cloudy  Overcast  Overcast  Sunny  Sunny  Temp  10 C  11 C  10 C  12 C  12 C   182  This table of weather information, however, doesnʼt give you the  same effect as a weather forecaster standing in front of a large map.   When enough data points are plotted geographically, trends   can begin to emerge. This is as true for weather as for crime  statistics and other geographically determined data. Itʼs something  that a plain list cannot effectively convey.   Representing multi-variable data on a map   Plotting multi-variable data in a regular grid system with x- and  y-axes is easier than plotting on to a geographical map. When  adding multi-variable data to a map, different graph types begin to  merge together and trouble starts brewing.  One example of merging multi-variable data with latitude   and longitude is the addition of a bar chart or pie chart at the  corresponding geographical point. It attempts to convey that in a  particular area certain statistics have been found. If the bar or pie  chart shows only a single variable range, such as Red versus Blue,  then the gradient method can be used, but if it contains more than  two variables, the chart mixing begins.  The best way to solve this is to avoid it altogether, or re-  evaluate what is required. What is the goal? What story needs to be  told? With an answer to those questions, it should be possible to go  back and try a different design.   Maps and time   Showing data over time using a map is difficult. We see this most  often on weather satellite charts, which animate the weather  moving over the map.  It is possible to display single variable data on a map over   time using the same gradient technique where white is one value  and black a second value. Instead of quantity or intensity being  expressed in the gradient between white and black, a rate of  change can be conveyed. So, something like the value of property    183  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Maps, choropleths and cartograms  over a ten year period in a given city can be plotted on a map. As  house prices rose or fell they would be shaded with more white or  black accordingly. Such a chart doesnʼt describe what the value of  the property was at the start, only that it rose or fell. It is the same  technique used in the treemap in chapter 18.  In a dynamic context, animations can take initial conditions   into account because anyone can scroll back to the earliest   point to see the baseline data and compare it to the data from a  later time.  Maps and geography can also be used in a timeline. A famous  example was created in 1869 by Charles Joseph Minard, describing  Napoleonʼs 1812 campaign in Russia.    184  This works very well partly because Napoleonʼs army marched in  a consistent direction, west to east, before retreating east to west.  Had Napoleon taken a more complex route, this flow map might  not have been possible.  When moving from point to point across the map, time passes.   If the line crosses over itself or goes backwards, a gradient can be  added so that as time progresses to the end, the line gets darker  and darker to demonstrate change.  A map showing volume and direction is called a flow map.  Flow maps aren’t much used: they are close to the realm of  visualizations and infographics. It is hard to determine how many  items where shipped from the start and how many ended up at  each destination.   185  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Radar Plots  22  Radar plots     Radar plots sometimes go by different names – spider plots,  star plots – so donʼt get confused: theyʼre all the same thing. In  a radar plot, lines radiate out from a central point, increasing in  value as they move away from the centre; each line represents a  single category or aspect of the data. Data points on each arm are  connected to the next via a line graph which creates a polygon.  5 4 3 2 1  As each of the categories is connected to the others, similar values  make for a more even shape. The further from the centre the shape  appears, the greater or higher the results. The shape will often  vary: it can be small or large, a sort of diamond or something that  looks like a wheel of cheese with a chunk taken out of it. You can  have fun inventing your own names.  Radar plots work best when they have a small set of attributes.  The more arms there are, the more acute the angle between them.  With 360 attributes, there will be only one degree for each which,  if the data jumps from high to low, could result in a disorienting  starburst effect.   186  The size and resolution of the radar plot will influence the density  of attributes which can be modelled. There is no guideline of how  many is too many, so itʼs best to err on the side of fewer arms. As  weʼll see later, if you encounter problems with too many attributes,  then maybe a radar plot isnʼt the best graph to use. Maybe a bar  chart would be more appropriate.  One argument for the existence of this type of graph is that   it works well when overlaid with other radar plots to create a  composite image. This provides you with an overview of all the  different items being modelled and trends can be easily identified.              Just like a line graph, a radar plot can contain multiple data sets  at once, and all the same problems apply: how to pick distinct  colours or  if in black and white  how to pick distinct shapes, and  so on. This example uses opacity to let the data sets show through,  but this technique works effectively only with a small number of  data sets.  All the techniques described in chapter 6 that can reduce the  number of pixels also apply to radar plots. Unnecessary axes can  be removed, as well as tick marks, the shape can be reduced to only  the observed range, and so on. But as we strip away more of what  isnʼt data, problems can emerge.   187  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Radar Plots  5 4 3 2 1  5  5 3.5  3  3.5  4  4  5  3.5  0  4  3  4  3.5  With a line graph or bar chart, the vertical axis only appears  once; with a radar plot, each radial point requires some sort of  demarcation. But what might be more important is just the shape  of the object in comparison to others. If you are keen to convey the  actual values, then shape recognition is of little use but, if youʼre  just looking to spot the odd ball in a set of data, this could be a  good technique.  As you can see, test subject four doesnʼt look like the rest.  It might be possible to miss this in a table of numbers, but the  visualization makes it clear.   Multiscalar plots   Each line radiating from the centre can support its own scale.  While this can be dangerous because few people will immediately  notice the different values, it allows different kinds of data to  be displayed on one chart. For instance, one attribute might be  average rainfall in millimetres, whereas the next attribute might  be average humidity. Two different scales would be required on  the same graph.   188  5 4 3 2 1  2  0  %  4  0  %  6  0  %  8  0  %  10  0  %  Issues   There are two major problems with the radar plot. First is the  difficulty of comparing data across the diameter of the ring.  Comparing a value on the second axis with the fourth axis is  hindered not only by the distance between them but also because  they are rotated in space. A vertical scale at each point is needed to  help determine the value. This adds ink and pixels, decreasing the  data to pixels ratio. Other chart types rarely have to repeat values  on their axes, making this a drawback for radial charts.  The second problem is the distorting effect radar plots have   on area. The outermost circumference of a radar plot encompasses  a larger area than the innermost circumference, and it therefore  acquires added visual weight. The red line connects the value five  on all the axes and the blue line marks one on each of the axes.   The area within the red line, however, is much more than five  times the area within the blue line, yet that is the ratio according to  the scale.   189  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Radar Plots  The footprint of a radar plot is usually square even when each of  the radial arms is the same length, creating a circle. The height of a  radar graph is approximately twice the size of the scale. So if there  are ten units, the plot needs to be twenty units in height. This  leaves a wasted area around the edges of the chart. Below, this area  is shaded to reveal what is not part of the graph, but is still taken  up by its footprint. Like the pie chart, there is more wasted space  than in other chart types.  A bar chart of the same data need only be ten units in height  because it does not cut an arc around a central point, but instead  extends horizontally. Depending on the number of values, the  width can be less than the corresponding radar plot. If our goal  is to reduce the data to pixel ratio, then as much cruft as possible  needs to be eliminated.  Often information on a radar plot can be illustrated more  clearly on a bar chart. Itʼs much easier to read and takes up less  space when comparing a low number of values on the same scale.  5 4 3 2 1  5 4 3 2 1   190  Since order is not in itself significant in a radar plot, the same as  a bar chart, we can rearrange the values to make the order best  suit the circumstances; maybe it is best to reference the data  alphabetically, or by region, or from least to greatest.   Extra care needs to be taken with radar plots containing   different scales on each arm, as these may need to become separate  bar charts. In the previous weather example, we couldnʼt put  average rainfall in millimetres on the same bar chart as average  humidity, but they can be displayed on independent bar charts.  When overlaying radar plots, it can be useful to take averages   of all the values and display them on a bar chart. This is much  more empirical than making the viewer guess at what the averages  might be from sight.  5 4 3 2 1  3.8 2.1 3.8 4.24 .0  It doesnʼt create as pretty a picture, but the goal of your design  is to tell the dataʼs story, not let the reader make an incorrect  interpretation.    191  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Radar Plots  Polar area diagram   The polar area diagram was invented by Florence Nightingale in  1858 as an aid to describing her experiences in the Crimean War.  It is sometimes used synonymously with the term coxcomb.  This is because Nightingale referred to a compilation of these  diagrams as a coxcomb and the term later became attached to  the diagrams themselves. As a nurse during the war she tried to  improve the living conditions of hospitalized soldiers. Many died  from infections and other non-battle-related injuries. At the time,  ending up in hospital actually increased a soldierʼs chances of  dying due to poor hygienic conditions.  In a report that she produced for the British government,  Nightingale outlined all the different causes of death during  several months of the war. This was represented in the   diagram below:  Diagram of the Causes of Mortality   in the Army in the East  Preventable or Mitigable Zymotic disease Wounds All other causes  July  A  u  g  u st  J u n e  a i r a g u B  l  M ay  ril p A  4 5 8 1  S  e  p  t  e  m  b  e  r  Crimea O cto b e r  November  h  c  r  a  M  y r a ru b  e  F  December  January 1855  The black line across November 1854 marks the boundry of the deaths from all other causes during that month. In October 1854, the black coincides with the red.  Florence Nightingale 1856   192  It was a very early visualization, so I wonʼt fault her for her efforts,  but there are several improvements that could be made to the  design. First, this isnʼt actually a stacked area graph: the bars  are hidden behind each other. This is why she makes the notes  about months November, October and April. The chart attempts  to compare data both within the same month and to each of the   other months.  Is anything gained by telling this story in the round? Or should   the data be converted into a bar chart? There are two options: an  area chart showing all of the casualties and the breakdown by each  type; or three separate bars for each month. Each tells a slightly  different story.              Apr  May  June  July  Aug  Sept  Oct  Nov  Dec  Jan  Feb  Mar  Apr  May  June  July  Aug  Sept  Oct  Nov  Dec  Jan  Feb  Mar   193  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Radar Plots  Both options make the values and the relationships between them  clearer. The eye can more easily imagine a horizontal line across  the tops of the bars rather than an arc around the circle to try and  compare different monthsʼ values.  Florence Nightingale introduced a new type of chart, even though  her data might have been better conveyed in a bar chart. There  are several legitimate uses for polar diagrams, such as the wind  rose which weʼll look at next. Without her contribution, it might  have been many more years before polar area diagrams were  discovered.  Wind rose   This is a type of circular chart that is less like a radar chart and  more of a representation of the data in a geographical form.  The wind rose displays wind speed and direction. The center  of the circle represents the point at which the measurements  were taken and the points radiating out follow the points of the  compass. In this example, the chart measures average wind speed  over a set period of time.   194  Wind speed  m s  by direction  NW  NE  W  E  SW  SE  N  50  40  30  20  10  S  You can easily see the prevailing wind direction is south- southeast. We understand this chart because we are used to a  spacial world. When we stand outside looking north, we act as the  centre of the wind rose. We intuitively understand the intensity  and frequency of the wind from this diagram. It is actually a very  specific type of map, showing not political borders, but relative  spacial position. The length of the bars could represent different  attributes such as wind speed, air temperature or intensity of  sunlight falling on the detector.  This is a good chart design to have in your toolbox. It is very   specific, and fills a unique niche in spacial representations.      195  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Gauges and Thermometers  23  Gauges and thermometers  Measuring devices that are not usually professionally employed to  show progress levels are the gauge and thermometer. If this is the  voice you want to speak with, then maybe thermometers are for  you, but generally they equate to kitsch chart junk.   Thermometers   Charity fundraisers like to use thermometers to show the progress  of donations. Next time you see a thermometer used in this way,  ask yourself, “What is this thermometer actually showing?” They  attempt to show two things: progress and quantity. Over time,  people can see the progress of the thermometer rising towards  the top, which is the target amount. It also shows us the current  quantity pledged toward the goal.   $10,000  $7,500  $5,000  $2,500  $0  $7,400  It is really two distinct possible charts. It could be as simple as  a bar chart with a single bar – the vertical axis is the quantity  pledged. This is exactly the same as the thermometer, but  without the chart junk bulb at the bottom and extra design of the  thermometer itself.    196  $10,000  $7,500  $5,000  $2,500  $0  $10,000  $7,500  $5,000  $2,500  $0  Jan  Feb  Mar  Apr              The thermometer is also trying to be a line graph. Over time,  contributions are added to the pool, thereby increasing the height  of the thermometer reading. This has the same effect as adding  data points to the line graph as the time passes. The line graphʼs  vertical axis is the amount pledged. Over time it rises, which  also lets us look back at any given date and see the amount. It  could be that just before the end of the tax year more donations  are received, or perhaps around holidays or major promotional  activity. With a single bar or thermometer, this interesting data   is lost.   Gauges and dials   There have been whole books written on these topics. Most agree  that gauges and dials are a bad idea! For an excellent resource, see  Information Dashboard Design: The Effective Visual Communication of  Data by Stephen Few.  If we ignore the use of nineteenth century-style steam gauges   in a digital world, the chart junk and other unnecessary pixels  should instantly alert us to a few problems. The new generation  of people coming to computers has probably never seen a five and  a quarter inch floppy disk, or even a three and half inch disk, yet  many of our applicationsʼ save icons use this metaphor.    197  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Gauges and Thermometers  It looks somewhat outdated now: imagine how it will look in five  to ten years. But we still persist with dashboard gauges that are not  only from a past era, but pointless.  Dials and gauges present a similar problem to pie charts  and other radial diagrams: comparing separated values with  different orientations is difficult to accomplish. Without the  labels, would anyone understand that the needle has moved  from zero to seventy? The angle would have to be estimated and  converted to the approriate scale, and the value would have to be  guessed at. Presenting the value on its own would be much more  straightforward and informative.  0      30       4   2               0  1                   0     0         50     60     7  0            8  0                 9 0        100  Not only that, but there are many wasted pixels as this is a circular  diagram. A round gauge uses only the circular area to convey data,  but a square shape is taken up within the flow of the document.  This means that over 21% of the pixels are wasted.   198  0      30       4   2               0  1                   0     0         50     60     7  0            8  0                 9 0        100   4 × 4 units square = 16 square units. Circle = pi × 22 = 12.4.  Subtracting the circleʼs area from the squareʼs leaves 3.4 which is  21.4% of the area   The same information can be supplied in various different   ways: shapes, colours or simply text! Does the reader need to know  that the needle indicates 80% on the dial or can 80% be displayed  in a warning colour?     0         50     60     7  0      30       4   2               0  1                   0  0                  8           0      100 80  9 0     199  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Gauges and Thermometers  The difference in legibility between the tiny arrow in the gauge  and the large number in the yellow box is marked. The text value  could be reduced in size without compromising its effectiveness  and would save space.  To its credit, what a gauge does provide is an upper limit.   If the gauge was measuring a threat level between one and five,  and it was replaced with text, then a large figure 4 isnʼt very  informative. Four out of what? Ten? Four out of four? A gauge  provides the reader with the relevant details to aid understanding.  There are two ways around this. Firstly, the scale could be  so well known that there is no need to state X out of Y – movie  classifications, for instance. The US system of movie ratings – G,  PG, PG-13, R and NC-17 – is very well known  in the US, at least .  Stating “PG-13 out of five” doesnʼt make sense. A similar problem  plagues the star ratings we talked about in chapter 17. One way to  solve this is to display empty stars so the reader knows the upper  limit. So, secondly, if replacing the gauge with text, be sure to state  the upper bound explicitly.  Part of the problem with using gauges and dials as alerts is  that they become part of the background. If 99% of the time the  needle sits in the green, the gauge isnʼt worth looking at; then  that one per cent of the time when it is in the red, the gauge will  go unnoticed. There is no need for an “everything is OK” alarm, so  why have the gauge when the value is in the green? Make it appear  only when there is a warning, then itʼs obvious when there is  trouble! But now weʼve strayed from our subject – this is less about  data and more about user interface design and human behaviour.    200   201  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Sound  24  Sound   One subject we havenʼt touched on is the use of senses other than  sight when designing with data. None of the examples in this  book make use of smell, texture, taste or sound. Thatʼs not to say  you couldnʼt make a physical, three-dimensional version of any of  these graphs for visually impaired people to understand the data. Itʼs pretty unlikely that weʼll make a smell or taste chart any  time soon. In fact, Iʼm not sure Iʼd want to smell different stocks  and have their spiciness equate to upward trends and sourness  equate to downward trends. Without exploring this cul-de-sac  too far, there are only five basic flavours – salty, sweet, sour, bitter  and umami  sometimes referred to as savoury  – which would be  a problem if different flavours were assigned to different items  in the chart. Like colours, variations and mixtures of the flavours  would have to be used and people without sophisticated palates  would get confused. Is that sour, or sweet and sour?   Sounds as data points   We can, however, experiment with sound as an medium for data.  Back in chapter 3 we talked about the difference between dynamic  and static charts. When dealing with sound, we are no longer in  the realm of static design. Sound is dynamic information that  can be played at different times with specific durations and at  particular pitches.  There are several ways to encode sound. The obvious example   is musical notation. The key signature, tempo, note pitches  and duration are transcribed using a standardized format. This  is similar to words on a page: the written music is read and  understood by the musicians who then transform it into sound as  they play or sing.  Methods of encoding sound can also be physical or   mechanical. A vibrating needle etched sound waves on to wax  cylinders to first record sound that could be played back; vinyl  records work in a similar way. Now CDs, DVDs and MP3s use  digital bits. There are analog equivalents to those digital ones and  zeros: the old player pianos  sometimes called pianolas  whose    202  piano rolls map the music in perforated paper; or those tiny music  boxes where a toothed wheel rotates against chimes to make  sounds at the correct intervals to play a tune. These are interactive  but also analog.  http:  www.nytimes.com interactive 2010 02 26 sports olympics 20100226-olysymphony.html  The New York Times tried an experiment with an audio chart.  It took events from the 2010 Winter Olympics and plotted the     race times.   The winning athleteʼs time was placed at the zero point and  everyone elseʼs time was offset from this. For instance, if it took  the winner 1 minute 54.31 seconds to complete the course, that  becomes the zero point. If the next competitorʼs time was 1 minute  54.40 seconds weʼd subtract the winning time from it, meaning  he was 0.09 seconds behind the winner and that time would be  plotted at 0.09 seconds after the zero on the timeline.  An audible beep was added for each contestantʼs time as a data   point. Pressing play plays the series of beeps, each spaced out in  time as the athletes crossed the finish line. Itʼs an interesting way  to represent the data both visually and audibly. From a graph, the  reader canʼt feel what itʼs like to be 0.09 seconds behind, but from  a series of notes a listener can discover how close or far apart 0.09  seconds is.  This idea could be used in many different situations. Imagine   real time edits to Wikipedia as a tune. The size of the edit could  adjust the pitch, so the changes in the text could be heard as a    203  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Sound  melody. If the sounds consisted of ambient noises, then you could  go about your daily business until a shriek of high-pitched tones  caught your ear. Those might be frequent, large edits, possibly the  mark of a spammer.  I have heard of system administrators doing something   similar with server activity. Instead of a dashboard of green lights  and percentages of server loads  and we know how well gauges  and thermometers work as charts and graphs , they switched  to bird sounds. Maybe each server had a distinct bird chirp. As  activity increased, the sound would go from calm to a cacophony  of birdsong. At that point, the sysadmins knew something was  wrong and had a look.  In certain situations, itʼs possible to use sound as a way to   convey information behind the data and to tell a story. From  Olympic medal times and wiki updates to server loads, unique  uses to engage the other senses can be found.   Visualizing sound   Sound travels in waves, which can easily be visualized.  We recognize a waveform shape from just about any audio app.              1    http:  bza.biz project wavefrom-necklace    204  There are peaks and valleys, dead air and noise. These waveforms  are made up of hundreds of pitches and different tones. A pure  tone on an oscilloscope would produce a smooth sine wave.  Some people have turned this into art and created waveform  jewellery1. It is a nice way to visualize sound, but it doesnʼt tell    us much.  Different tones have different wavelengths, each producing   different vibrations in our ears and, therefore, different sounds in  our brains. Waveforms are one way to visualize sound, but perhaps  not the most exciting or unique. Enter Ernst Florens Friedrich  Chladni.  Ernst Chladni was born in late 1756 in Germany. Like William   Playfair, Chladni was a something of a polyglot. He had degrees  in law and philosophy, but was more interested in physics and  music. Drawing on his scientific knowledge, he researched and  developed several interesting techniques in the study of sound  and is sometimes referred to as the father of acoustics. He was also  an early pioneer in studying meteorites and is regarded by some  as the father of meteoritics, but weʼll have to leave that story for  another time.  In 1787 he published his Discoveries in the Theory of Sound,   in which he describes his development of an earlier experiment  by Robert Hooke  1635–1703  of Oxford University. Chladni drew  a bow across a metal plate  subsequently named after him as    205  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Sound  Chladni plates  whose surface was lightly covered with sand. The  vibrations through the plate excited the sand particles and settled  them into a nodal pattern caused by the sound waves. These  experiments can create beautiful designs based on   different pitches.      Today, these shapes are generated in much the same way  except that instead of a bow a loudspeaker emitting a specific  pitch is used – the effects are the same. There are plenty of  videos about how these patterns are created and the mysteries  surrounding them. In the Rosslyn Chapel just south of Edinburgh  in Scotland, there are several designs in the stonework which  look very much like these patterns. The chapel, built in the mid  fifteenth century, is one of the places reputed to be the hiding  place of the Holy Grail and is decorated with many cryptic  symbols. A father-and-son team matched the stone Chladni  patterns into their musical pitch equivalents, producing a tune  they call Rosslyn Motet.    Knowledge of these patterns is used in the construction of  acoustic instruments such as guitars and violins. The patterns  represent complex mathematical equations and all the data points  which underlie the acoustic sounds. By putting sand on the bodies  and playing a particular pitch, a specific Chladni pattern should  emerge. If not, then the construction and shape of the instrument  are incorrect. This is an ingenious way to test the design to see if it  generates the same audio data set in a consistent manner between  instruments.  The study of visible sound and vibrations is referred to as  cymatics. If you are interested in learning more, searching for  “cymatics” or “Chladni” is an excellent starting point.    206   207  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Everything and the kitchen sink  25  Everything and the kitchen sink  Sadly, this is the last chapter and there is so much more to explore!  Before we go, itʼs important to at least touch on a few other charts  and graphs which show promise and can be adapted to uses  beyond their original purpose. Once you understand what each is  designed to represent and your data fits those critiera, you should  feel confident in using them.   Population pyramid   The population pyramid is an uncommon type of chart that youʼre  not likely to have come across. This isnʼt because it is bad, but  because its use is quite specific.  80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0  80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0   208  The name comes from the chartʼs appearance: it tends to look like  a pyramid in shape. It is split vertically down the middle – in the  examples, one side represents males  blue , the other females   purple . Each horizontal bar is a count of people in a particular  age group. Age increases up the vertical axis with fewer and fewer  people in the higher age groups.  The different shapes of the pyramid give a general overview   of the population and potential troubles down the road. An aging  baby boomer generation outnumbers later births. Chinaʼs one  child per family initiative has decimated the lower half of its  pyramid. Rising child mortality rates would appear in this chart as  a straighter-sided pyramid. If there was a high birth rate but few  children survived past the age of five, there would be a large bulge  at the bottom, with a curve upwards resembling a hockey stick.  80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0  80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0  80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0  Since the pyramids are effectively two bar charts turned on their  sides and placed back to back, all the benefits and weaknesses  discussed in chapter 17 regarding bar charts apply. The bars are  absolute values, so you can compare two different population  pyramids as long as the scale is the same.  There are opportunities to replicate the framework of a   population pyramid with other data types. The goal of the design  is to deal with a data set over time, so this could be growth of cities  each year, number of cars sold per year, and so on.   209  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Everything and the kitchen sink  80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0              0  1 0  2 0  3 0  4 0  5 0  6 0  7 0  8 0  This, of course, could be designed as a line graph or regular  bar chart. The pyramid aspect brings with it the opportunity to  compare the two variables next to each other, just like two lines on  a line graph.  Phillips curve   In 1958, the economist William Phillips wrote a paper called ʻThe  Relationship between Unemployment and the Rate of Change of  Money Wages in the United Kingdom 1861–1957ʼ. He attempted  to show an inverse relationship between unemployment and the  inflation rate  when inflation is high, unemployment is low . For  the article, he created a new type of chart which now bears his  name: the Phillips curve.  ʼ05  ʼ04  ʼ03  ʼ02  ʼ07  ʼ06  ʼ01  ʼ08  Unemployment  n o i t a fl n I  EDI  LON  PAR  TUR  BAR  AUS  LIS  ROM  Longitude  e d u t i t a L   210  A Phillips curve is a sort of cross between a scatter plot and a  line graph. The grid plots the unemployment rate on one axis  and inflation or deflation on the other. This makes it similar to a  scatter plot but by connecting the data points, a sort of scribbly  timeline is formed.  While Phillips tried to demonstrate a specific shape in his   paper, itʼs possible to reuse this concept in other ways. If we  look back at chapter 21 about maps, we could overlay a Phillips- style curve of both time and direction to some travel plans: from  London to Paris; then Paris to Madrid; Madrid to Rome, and so on.  Just as the Phillips curve plots points on two axes, we can replace  unemployment and inflation with latitude and longitude, then  connect the points over time. This doesnʼt imply that latitude  and longitude have a statistical relationship, but it shows that the  visual characteristics of the Phillips curve can be repurposed.   One disadvantage of a Phillips curve is that it has the potential   to get cluttered quickly as the line retraces itself. It is a halfway  house between a scatter plot and a flow map. It isnʼt as heavy as a  flow map with large arrows and it has an extra dimension – time –  which is lacking in a scatter plot. This is another chart type to keep  in your toolbox as you design with data.   Venn diagrams   Itʼs widely believed that around 1880 John Venn – yes, he was a  real person – created a way to visualize sets graphically using  overlapping circles. This kicked off the field of set theory and had  wider impacts in a variety of other disciplines.   Venn diagrams can be used when there are several possible  relations between a finite collection of data sets. Venn diagrams  quickly map out possibilities visually to help aid understanding  of the logic. Letʼs take the statements “Humans are mammals” and  “All mammals are in the animal kingdom”, and ask “Is a human an  animal?” Because of set theory and a string of logical statements,  we can prove this true. This same chain of logic is what got  Socrates killed, so I wouldnʼt go around at the next party spouting  off. Itʼs for your own safety, trust me.    211  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Everything and the kitchen sink  Venn diagrams allow us to quickly identify why this is true. First,  thereʼs a box which represents everything in the universe. Inside  that box is placed a circle labelled “Animal Kingdom”. Within that  is a smaller circle labelled “Mammals”. Finally, a point labelled  “Humans” is inside the mammals circle.   Everything  Animal Kingdom  Mammals  Humans  The question was, “Are humans animals?” Since the dot for  humans is entirely inside the mammals circle, which is entirely  inside the animal kingdom circle, then, yes, this statement is true.  If the mammals circle is removed, the point for humans remains  inside the animals circle.   Now letʼs try a slightly more complicated representation.   There is a group of people who enjoy peanut butter sandwiches,  a group of people who enjoy jam sandwiches and a third group  of people who enjoy banana sandwiches. These are three sets of  people, and there will probably be some overlap between them,  since some people will eat peanut butter and jam sandwiches and  others will eat banana and peanut butter sandwiches. Then there  are the unfortunate people who have peanut allergies and like to  eat banana and jam sandwiches.    212  Peanut Butter and Jam  Peanut Butter  Jam  Peanut Butter and Bananas  Bananas  Jam and Bananas  The Venn diagram allows us to more easily tell the story of who fits  where and how large the overlap is between the three groups.   Creating a Venn diagram creates a visual representation of the   interrelations between data. In this case, it is also a sanity check  because there canʼt be more peanut butter and banana sandwich  eaters than just plain peanut butter eaters, since every peanut  butter and banana eater is also a peanut butter eater.  There are a few downsides to Venn diagrams. The overlapping  shapes can become complex. Mapping out with consistency many  more than three sets is difficult. Also, without labels itʼs difficult to  judge accurately the percentage of overlap: is that a 50% or 52.45%  overlap? With two arcs of two overlapping circles that may be  different sizes, our mathematics might fail us.    213  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Everything and the kitchen sink  Crop circles   Iʼm just sayinʼ! You never know! Whether hoaxes or signs of UFO  invasion, crop circles registered in the worldʼs consciousness  in the 1990s. Their designs and complexity have varied over the  years, probably because their creators practised more and more,  or tried to out-circle the other guys. Either way, some have had  incredibly mathematical and beautiful designs that it would be a  shame to pass by in a book about designing with data.  Whoʼs to say that mathematical relationships between two ratios  of objects canʼt be represented in other ways besides numbers? If  we were trying to communicate across languages and cultures,  we might need to use means other than letters and numbers. Of  course, we donʼt need to go to another world to find someone who  doesnʼt understand English. Is it better to label the chart Male and  Female, or is it better to be language agnostic and use icons?   Some scientists have given this a lot of thought over the years.   In 1977, NASA sent messages into outer space with the Voyager  spacecraft with a Golden Record containing sounds and images  portraying the diversity of life and culture on Earth. To explain to  an extraterrestrial who has never seen a record player the actions  needed to create one and at what speed to play the record required  a bizarre set of instructions1.  1     http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Voyager_Golden_Record   214  Equally as strange as the crop circles, we too have left cryptic  messages to be decoded by others using the Arecibo radio  telescope. In late 1974, humans beamed a message towards a star  cluster some 25,000 light years away. This was the Arecibo message  which was only ever sent once1.  1      http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Arecibo_message   215  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Everything and the kitchen sink              This has to qualify as one of the densest and most well thought  out visualizations ever created. What was sent was a series of 1,679  ones and zeros, colour coded in this illustration to help identify  the shapes. The dimensions – 23 columns by 73 rows – were  chosen because they are both prime numbers. Ordering the linear  stream of ones and zeros correctly makes the rectangular graphic.  Each individual bit used and the total amount of bits contributes  to the data of the chart itself: nothing is wasted. There is a lot to  be learnt from astronomy that we can apply to our more mundane  data-driven designs.   Chernoff faces   Herman Chernoff is an American mathematician born in 1923.  His contribution to charts and graphs comes from the 1973 journal  article, ʻThe Use of Faces to Represent Points in K-Dimensional  Space Graphicallyʼ. Faces are interesting graphical objects. As  humans, we are very good at finding tiny but distinct differences  in peopleʼs faces. In those wildlife shows where naturalists know  the names and faces of all the monkeys and apes they study – to  me, they all look the same. Yet we donʼt confuse our friends or  even people weʼve seen only once or twice – hence the phrase,  “Your face looks familiar”. We have an inate ability to recognize  and decipher faces, and thatʼs exactly the idea behind using  Chernoff faces to describe data.  To make a Chernoff face, several pieces of data are encoded  into different features. For instance, a range of zero to ten could  be encoded in the width of the face: the larger the number, the  wider the face. The angle of the eyebrows can be tweaked and any  part of the face can be changed: nose size, hair, eyes, mouth width  and how smiley it is, ears, and plenty of other characteristics. Itʼs  almost like a police identikit or Mr. Potato Head, where different  parts can be swapped out depending on different values.   216  If you have a set of data with different attributes, Chernoff faces  make for an excellent cross-comparison. This was done in  2008 using American baseball statistics. Each team had several  attributes: wins, losses, home runs, and so on. Each of those was  mapped to different parts of a face; placing them all side by side  immediately revealed subtle differences.  http:  www.nytimes.com 2008 04 01 science 01prof.html   217  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Everything and the kitchen sink  The face as a device to describe data works really well. It also has  a fairly high data to pixel ratio because there is very little that  isnʼt data. Edward Tufte has pointed out that a Chernoff face is  symmetrical, so twice as much data is depicted than is actually  required; each face could be split down the middle vertically and  it would contain exactly the same information. This is true, but  people respond better to a complete set of facial features.   Word clouds   If you think about it, a word cloud is similar to a pie chart: all the  words in the cloud are displayed at relative sizes to each other.  This means that word clouds suffer from many of the same  problems as pie charts. Itʼs difficult to compare two word clouds.  The largest word in one cloud could be the same size as the largest  word in another, but their respective absolute values could be  levels of magnitude apart. The sizes of words are relative only  within a single cloud, just as a 50% wedge in a pie chart canʼt yield  an absolute count when comparing it to a second pie chart.   218  That said, word clouds do have advantages over pie charts in that  it is clear when one section stops and another starts. A word cloud  can contain many more words than a pie chart can have wedges;  a pie chart that has 360 wedges would be ridiculous, but a word  cloud of 360 words has the potential to be very information dense. The same colour can be reused without the concern that two   items would get confused. This allows the addition of a second  variable into the mix, making the design of a tag cloud similar  to that of a tree map. It can show both relative size and a second  variable by adjusting the colour. For instance, green words might  be trending up whereas red words might be trending down. A large  red word could indicate that in the last time period it would have  appeared even larger; a large green word could indicate that it is on  the rise.  When dealing with relative values, the shapes also need to  be relative. As we saw in chapter 11, when an itemʼs height and  width are doubled in two dimensions its area is squared; in three  dimensions the volume is cubed. If one word cloudʼs largest word  set in a 72 point font is the word ʻboyʼ and a second word clouldʼs  largest 72 point word is ʻonomatopoeiaʼ, there is a mismatch in the  relative lengths. The height may be the same, but the area each  word covers is vastly different. This makes longer words appear to  have a greater weight in the given context.  If we look at the data to pixel ratio for a word cloud, it has to  be one of the highest possible. There are no additional pixels that  describe the chart. Each one is used in conveying information.  Every drop is used in conveying information. This is both a word  cloudʼs great advantage and its downfall. Without any sort of scale,  it is nearly impossible to cross-reference and extract the numeric  values that are hidden in the design.  Word clouds are relatively new, as the software needed to   dynamically generate the sizes and prevent overlapping has only  recently become mainstream. Time will tell if word clouds can  find a seat at the adult charts and graphs table, or if they will be  relegated to the childrenʼs table, forever used as a filler and friend  only to the doughnut chart.    219  A Practical Guide to Designing with data  ~ Everything and the kitchen sink  Summary   This is the end of our journey through the world of common and  not so common charts and graphs. In the first three parts of this  book, we laid the foundations for designing with the data. In the  final two parts, we talked about the specifics.  Weʼve come a long way since discussing the first pie chart   ever created to knowing the ins and outs of some of the craziest  and least useful graphs youʼve probably ever seen. But thatʼs all  been part of the plan. You need to know what works and, more  importantly, what doesnʼt.  These designs are always evolving. There was a time before   population pyramids and word clouds, even before bar charts and  pie charts. As the landscape shifts with time and fashion, you  need to recognize what works and what doesnʼt, as well as which  tools are best for telling a particular kind of story based on the  data. This is why it is important to understand both the common  and uncommon graphs and charts. Any new chart development  will most likely be an offshoot of an existing design, all of which  have their good and bad points.               220   221  A Practical Guide to Designing with Data  Conclusion  This book is about how to design the data so that it tells a story,  enlightens your readers and helps to them to make informed  decisions.  At this point, you should be not only capable of spotting bad   chart design, but have the tools and knowledge to correct it. Weʼve  taken quite a journey since the first page. You now have the ability  to go out and create extraordinary designs using data.  As you sit down to illustrate that next chart, ask yourself a few  simple questions:    	 What am I trying to convey? Will my design achieve that?   	 Is this the right chart? Is the data time-sensitive? Are we looking at   only a part or the whole picture?    	 Is there anything that I can remove and have the graph still tell the   same story?    	 Are the colours usable? Will this be printed in black and white?   What if the audience has problems with colour?   	 Did I label the chart data and provide a title for it?  As homework, you should continue to practise creating better  charts and graphs using the tips you have learnt in this book. Take  an everyday item like your phone bill and try to make a better  visualization from the table of data: who you called, how often and  for how long are all possible variables to graph. What is the story  behind those boring numbers? Once you start creating graphs,  youʼll come to understand your mistakes and gradually improve  your skills. Donʼt be afraid to try different approaches.  You might not realize it, but one of the greatest charts weʼve   all seen is under constant scrutiny. In 1869, a Russian chemist  named Dmitri Mendeleev sat down with an ordered list of data.  Each item in this list had a numeric value that was sequential,  but at the same time there were clusters of attributes that could  also be grouped. Mendeleev struggled for a long time to find the  best order for the items in this list until he noticed a number  of interesting patterns in the data. These patterns led him to  believe that there might be some pieces missing from his list,    222              a controversial notion in its own right. He also realized that  by reconfiguring the list as a table, some of the patterns would  be resolved. In laying out the list in this new way, he created  the periodic table of elements that weʼre all familiar with. One  hundred and fifty years have passed since the original seeds were  sown and the periodic tableʼs format remains the same. Every  once in a while people try to improve on the design, some more  successfully than others.   If you consider that people are still trying to improve a chart   150 years after its invention, you should appreciate that your  design isnʼt really finished either. It just goes to show that there is  always room for improvement.   You need to remember that visualizations and infographics   arenʼt just buzzwords. At one point in time they were just  attempts to create denser and more information-rich illustrations.  Many of them fail, annoy and just plain confuse. You are now  knowledgeable in the foundations of designing with data. From  here, you can extend your abilities into more complex and richer  visualizations. I deliberately did not cover them in this book;  you need to learn how to walk before you can run and with only  twenty-five chapters, weʼre just skimming the surface of the  basics. With practice, hard work and a lot of pondering, you can  become an expert. By all means, try to create some infographics;  just remember everything youʼve read here. It all still applies, and  if I find out that you are using doughnut charts, Iʼll hunt   you down.      Remember, the goal of any chart is to tell a certain story. If  a picture is worth a thousand words, then a properly designed  chart is worth a thousand words multiplied by the data to pixel  ratio, plus some constant, plus a really large number to sound  important, and why not square that in the process? Just like any  good book has a beginning, middle and end, a chart needs an  introduction through its title, axes, and labels, a middle which  is the data, and an end which helps the reader towards a logical  conclusion. Maybe the chart makes a statement, demonstrating  an imbalance or a worrying prediction; no matter what it is, you    223  A Practical Guide to Designing with Data  are putting yourself into the design. You have chosen the story,  the data, what to show and what not to. Itʼs your duty to eliminate  confusion and to be as open and honest as possible with   the results.     As a memento, Iʼve created a special PDF file which outlines  the pros and cons of each of the major chart types. You can print  this out and keep it as a handy reference. It will help you decide  which charts and graphs to select in which situations. It is  something only for the people who have purchased this book as a  cheatsheet to remind you of everything youʼve read.  http:  designingwithdata.com select.pdf  Iʼm looking forward to seeing your creations and improving, in  my own small way, the thousands of charts and graphs printed   every day.               224

This book is a peek into the pinball machine of my mind, always bouncing around various related and sometimes unrelated topics. I wanted to draw together several techniques you can use in your charts and graphs, such as how to minimize the number of pixels, and at the same time explain some interesting aspects of colour in our lives. In addition, I felt it was important to explain how to spot bad or misleading design: the kind that unscrupulous people use to trick us into believing their interpretation of data rather than the facts. Only then can you properly focus on the data, bypass unnecessary distractions and avoid misrepresenting the information.
