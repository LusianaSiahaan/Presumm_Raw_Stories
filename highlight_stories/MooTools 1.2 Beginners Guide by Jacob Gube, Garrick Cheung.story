We're at a time where users expect  and often, demand    web interfaces that talk to them. Gone are the days where only desktop software was associated with smooth  and feature-packed user interfaces that performed complicated tasks. In fact,  applications that we normally think of as traditionally being for the desktop   such as Word Processors, Image editors, and Spreadsheet software  are now  moving to browser-based environments because of the many advantages of  web-based applications  such as operating system platform interdependency,  interoperability with other systems, and collaborative possibilities . JavaScript is the technology that's driving this evolution by giving web  developers the capability to create complex, robust, interactive web page  components and Rich Internet Applications  RIA  that respond effortlessly to  user actions through a combination of techniques such as Ajax, on-the-fly DOM  manipulation, and smooth, animated effects. However, JavaScript isn't perfect  in fact, it's far from it , its syntax is sometimes  unintuitive and repetitive, and often requires a great deal of code-authoring to  perform complicated and cross-browser-compatible operations.                                                                        MooTools and Me  This is where MooTools steps in! By providing web developers with a set of useful and  cross-browser-compatible functions, methods, and classes within an intuitive framework for  writing client-side scripts, we can side-step a lot of frustration and time, typically associated  with code-authoring in JavaScript:  In this chapter we shall:    Learn about what MooTools is   Discuss some advantages of using MooTools   Learn how to download and install MooTools   Learn about notable MooTools resources on the web  So let's get on with it!  What is MooTools?  MooTools  which stands for My Object-Oriented "JavaScript" Tools  is a lightweight, modular,  object-oriented JavaScript framework. It greatly speeds up and enhances the development  cycle of feature-rich Ajax JavaScript web applications. Created by Valerio Proietti—who  originally intended it to be an extension to the Prototype JavaScript framework—MooTools  has since grown into an independent, open-source, and very robust JavaScript framework  with a solid team of core developers and thousands of users who support, contribute, and  rabidly evangelize the project.  MooTools, in essence, abstracts normal JavaScript code so that you can write more terse   and elegant client-side scripts. It has a host of useful functions, methods, and classes that'll  let you develop robust web components and web applications.  The developers of MooTools strongly believe in applying Object-Oriented Programming  OOP   principles to JavaScript, a structural programming language. Since everything in JavaScript is an  object, MooTools provides a cleaner, easier, and more elegant way to manipulate the object to  our will. MooTools also helps make the JavaScript code cross-browser compatible.  Why use MooTools?  I've already mentioned that JavaScript isn't perfect; it's a language that's unintuitive at times  and doesn't have a lot of native functions and methods to deal with modern user demands.  For example, Ajax is all the rage these days; the concept of Ajax allows us to communicate  with our server-side scripts asynchronously. We heftily rely on Ajax requests and responses  to give users an uninterrupted experience as we update the Document Object Model  DOM   behind the scenes after he or she performs an action such as submitting a web form or  adding an item to their shopping cart.  [ 8 ]                                                                        Chapter 1  If all of that sounds complicated and seems like it would take an insurmountable heap   of JavaScript code to write, then you're right.  If you believe that MooTools will save you a lot of time and will help you write more   efficient and terse JavaScript, then you're two for two!  Let's look at the advantages of using MooTools.  The advantages of using MooTools There are many benefits to be had from learning and using MooTools.  Writing terse and elegant code I think most would agree that what makes coding in JavaScript awful is stuff like browser  quirks and non-standard behavior. In addition, it's very long-winded and even simple  operations can sometimes take several lines of code to author because the language is very  lightweight.  MooTools, like many of the other JS frameworks, aims at allowing web developers to write  complicated procedures with clean, reusable, and understandable code. Not only will this  improve the speed at which you complete your projects, but it also makes your code easier  to read and maintain.  Extending native JavaScript There are many functions and methods that web developers think JavaScript should have.  For example, Ajax can be challenging because there are no set standards to working with it in  JavaScript. MooTools attempts to address these missing parts in JavaScript by providing   web developers with a set of standardized and useful classes, methods, and functions.  For example, to address the lack of an Ajax class in JavaScript, MooTools has the Request  class which deals with operations involving XMLHttpRequest objects.  MooTools also has a variety of utility functions and methods that are extremely helpful  on many occasions, like the $each   function which allows you to easily loop through  objects such as non-regular arrays or function arguments, and the addEvent method which  attaches event listeners to page objects so that we can react to user actions like mouseovers  and mouse clicks.  [ 9 ]                                                                        MooTools and Me Cross-browser compatibility JavaScript has to run in a wide array of environments such as web browsers. Unlike  server-side scripting languages like PHP and Python, where the server is responsible   for compiling and interpreting your code, JavaScript is different in that the web browser  interprets your code. Web browsers all have different quirks and ways of interpreting  JavaScript, resulting in countless hours of debugging and browser testing.  MooTools handles these browser quirks for you. For example, web browsers have different  ways of dealing with Ajax requests. Internet Explorer 6 has the ActiveX object while  Mozilla-based browsers like Firefox have the XMLHttpRequest class.  Traditionally, whenever you create an Ajax request object in JavaScipt, you would have to  check first which web browser the user is using. Thus, creating Ajax request objects results   in a lot of if statements and browser-sniffing.  For example, this is one way of creating an Ajax request object in JavaScript:  var request;   Try Compatible Browser if   window.XMLHttpRequest   {   request = new XMLHttpRequest  ; }   Try IE6 else if  window.ActiveXObject  {    IE     request = new ActiveXObject "Microsoft.XMLHTTP" ; }   else {      Code that deals with the event that a browser doesn't support  XMLHttpRequest objects   document.write 'Browser is unsupported' ; }  In MooTools, you can forego all of that browser-sniffing. All you have to do to create an  XMLHttpRequest object is the following code:  var myRequest = new Request [insert arguments here] ;  There are two important things to note here:    You've just saved a ton of code to write   The request object you created will function the same way in all browsers  [ 10 ]                                                                        MooTools officially fully-supports and tests in the following web browsers  though it's very  likely that it'll work perfectly in most other web browsers :  Chapter 1  Safari 2+ Internet Explorer 6+ Firefox 2+  and browsers based on gecko    	  	  	  	 Opera 9+  Working with the Document Object Model A defining feature of most JavaScript frameworks and libraries is that they provide you  with a set of useful tools for working with the Document Object Model. Traversing and  manipulating the DOM in JavaScript can take massive amounts of code and can be  unintuitive to many web developers  not to mention having to deal with browser quirks that  can add to the length and development time of your functions .  MooTools has an intuitive syntax for selecting and working on page objects.  For example, if you want to select all the   hyperlinks with a class of big that links to  a .jpg file in a web page, it only takes a line of code:  var jpgLinks = $$ 'a.big[href$=.jpg]' ;  This line of code creates an array called jpgLinks containing the aforementioned set  of hyperlinks.  In ordinary JavaScript, this same complex selection operation would involve several   for loops and regular expression matching to accomplish. Modern browsers, such as  Safari 4, FireFox 3.5, and IE8  only CSS 2.1 compliant , are slowly catching up by   implementing document.querySelector and document.querySelectorAll methods  to simplify things.  The advantage of using open-source projects Remember the saying, "Two heads are better than one"? Now multiply that two by several  magnitudes of a thousand and that's the number of developers that constantly review, use,  and contribute to the MooTools project.  MooTools leverages the collective knowledge and skills of thousands of MooTools users  worldwide. Therefore, when a new bug is discovered, it is quickly reported and addressed.  Also, you'll encounter some of the most efficient JavaScript code written in MooTools  because it has been widely tested and inspected by MooTools users and the MooTools  development team.  By using MooTools, you'll have access to a tried-and-tested JavaScript code base.  [ 11 ]                                                                        MooTools and Me  Downloading and installing MooTools  The first thing we need to do is download a copy of MooTools from the official MooTools  website  http:  www.mootools.net .  It's important to note that, at the time of this writing, http:  www. mootools.com is not associated with MooTools. If you've mistakenly  navigated to mootools.com, don't worry, MooTools is alive and well. A simple  Google search for "mootools" should result in http:  mootools.net .  What's great about MooTools is that it's extremely modular. You can—as I fondly refer to it— roll your own version of it by downloading only the components that you're going to   use. This is important if you want to keep your web applications as light as possible.  For the purpose of this book, you should download the entire MooTools Core so that we can  make sure we're all in the same page.  Time for action – downloading and installing the MooTools Core The following steps will help you to download and install MooTools Core:  1.  Go to the MooTools Download page located at http:  mootools.net   download. You'll see three options, choose the Uncompressed version.  [ 12 ]                                                                        2.  Create an HTML document, call it whatever you want, but I'll call mine   index.html, as shown:  Chapter 1  3.   Install MooTools by referencing it in the   of your HTML document with  the following code:  <  script> Right below the MooTools script reference, place the following block of code:     window.addEvent 'domready', function   {    alert "Hello World!" ;  } ;     [ 13 ]                                                                        MooTools and Me  4.  Test your code by opening your HTML document in your favorite web browser.   If everything went according to plan, you should see something like this:  What just happened? We've just downloaded and installed MooTools by referencing it in an HTML document  that we created and then tested to see if we referenced the file correctly by writing a line   of JavaScript that displays "Hello World" in an alert box.   For your reference, your HTML markup should look similar to the following:  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional  EN"  "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-transitional.dtd">        Installing MooTools           window.addEvent 'domready', function   {     alert "Hello World!" ;   } ;             If all went well, congratulations! You're on your way to becoming a MooTools rockstar!  [ 14 ]                                                                        Chapter 1  Different MooTools downloads When you went to the MooTools download page, you had three options: YUI Compressor,  JSMin, and Uncompressed. These options have the same source code and differ only in  the source code format. The YUI Compressor and JSMin versions are compressed. They  are smaller in file size because unnecessary characters  such as those involved in code  formatting, like tabs, extra spaces, and inline comments  have been removed.  The process of removing extraneous characters in the source code is called Minification. The  trade-off in minifying your source code is that it's virtually unreadable, so we downloaded  the Uncompressed version, in case you wanted to see how MooTools works by studying the  source code.  The domready event listener When writing MooTools code, you will often want to execute the code as soon as possible,  otherwise it'll wait until other webpage components are loaded before it runs.  Let's take a closer look at the code we wrote earlier:  window.addEvent 'domready', function   {   alert 'Hello World' ; } ;  In this block of code, we used the addEvent method and we tell it to watch out for the  event that the window's DOM is ready  'domready' . Once the DOM is ready, we ask  the method to run the following function:  function   {   alert "Hello World" ; }  We will discuss the MooTools syntax and concepts in detail in Chapter 2, but for now, let's  just say that all code we write throughout this book will be wrapped inside the domready  event listener so they are executed as soon as possible.  Rolling your own MooTools  MooTools is one of the few JavaScript frameworks that come in different components; it  has a very modular design—it is divided into several interdependent parts. Because of its  modularity, we're able to pick and choose which parts of MooTools we want. However, if   you have a project that doesn't use all of the MooTools components, then it's a good   practice to only include the components that you need to reduce page weight and   improve response times.  [ 15 ]                                                                        MooTools and Me  MooTools is organized into two major parts: the MooTools Core and MooTools More   plugins that extend MooTools . Let's take a look at these two components.  MooTools Core Let's explore the MooTools Core by using the MooTools Core Builder on the  official MooTools website. This will give us a basic understanding of the MooTools   Core file structure.  Time for action – exploring the MooTools Core Builder To explore the MooTools Core Builder, perform the following steps:  1.  Go to the MooTools Core Builder webpage by navigating   to: http:  mootools.net core.  2.	 Notice that the MooTools Core is subdivided into 7 sections. Each section  has 2 to 6 JavaScript libraries associated with it. Take the time to read each  description to help you get a better understanding of what each file does.  [ 16 ]                                                                        Chapter 1  [ 17 ]                                                                        MooTools and Me  3.  Click on the Event component. Notice that several other components were   automatically selected for you. This ensures that you also include the dependency   files that are required for the Event component to run.  4.  Notice the different compression types. YUI Compressor is selected by default.  What just happened? We just covered how to roll your own MooTools Core file and learned about the MooTools  Core structure by exploring the MooTools Core builder. Once you're comfortable with how  MooTools works, you should use the MooTools Core Builder to create a MooTools Core file  that includes only the components you need.  [ 18 ]                                                                        Have a go hero – explore the MooTools Core Builder output Try to download the previous example with the Events component checked. After downloading  your own version of the MooTools Core, open the file in your favorite text editor. Also open  the MooTools Core file that you downloaded earlier. Notice that the one you just downloaded  is significantly shorter; that's because you only downloaded the Events component and its  dependency files.  Chapter 1  [ 19 ]                                                                        MooTools and Me  The entire uncompressed MooTools Core is close to 4,000 lines long  and has a file size   of 96 KB .  In comparison, the Core Builder output where only Events and its dependencies are included  is just a little over 1,000 lines of code  and weighing only 24 KB .  MooTools More The second part of the MooTools framework is simply called More. As the name implies,  it is a collection of useful plugins, functions, classes, and methods that extends the   MooTools Core.  [ 20 ]                                                                        Chapter 1  Time for action – exploring the MooTools More Builder To explore through the MooTools More Builder, perform the following steps  1.  Go to the MooTools More Builder page: http:  mootools.net more. 2.	 You'll see the same interface as the MooTools Core Builder.  Take some time to read the descriptions of each component.  [ 21 ]                                                                        MooTools and Me  What just happened? You've just learned where to download the More components of MooTools. This knowledge  will come into play in later chapters when we utilize these plugins in our code.  The API concept  MooTools is designed in such a way that instead of modifying the MooTools Core files, you  use its API  Application Programming Interface  to utilize MooTools function. This makes  MooTools easier to maintain your projects and makes it easily extensible.  A plugin is a JavaScript file that's dependent on MooTools but is not part of the standard  MooTools code base. We'll learn about writing plugins in a later chapter, but for now, just  think of plugins as MooTools extensions that do a specific function, such as hiding and  showing a page element or managing browser cookies.  It is important to note that—unless you know exactly what you're   doing—you shouldn't modify the MooTools Core files. Even if you   know what you're doing, it's best to keep the file "as is" so that it's  standardized and can be easily updated.  MooTools resources  In order to take full advantage of MooTools, you should check out these excellent resources:  MooTools Docs MooTools Docs  http:  mootools.net docs   contains the official MooTools  documentation. Created by the MooTools team, it's the most comprehensive online resource  for MooTools syntax and usage. As you write in MooTools, you'll find that this is a handy  resource to have open for quickly finding references to particular MooTools code.  MooTools Users Google groups The MooTools Users Google groups  http:  groups.google.com group mootools- users  is a discussion group on the topic of MooTools.

Summary  In this chapter we specifically covered:    What MooTools is and some of the advantages of using MooTools   How to download and install MooTools   The MooTools Core and More Builders   Online resources about MooTools  We also learned that all of our MooTools code will go inside the window. addEvent 'domready', function  method, so that they can run as soon as the DOM is  ready. In addition, we talked a little bit about the API concept and how we shouldn't modify  the MooTools Core files.  Now that we've learned a little bit about MooTools, we're ready to delve into the MooTools  syntax and concepts, which is the topic of the next chapter.  [ 23 ]                                                                                                                                              2  Writing JavaScript with MooTools  Using MooTools means you'll be coding in a web application framework that  excels in object-oriented programming and JavaScript best practices. Modern  development principles, such as unobtrusive JavaScript programming and  object-based logic is the bread and butter of MooTools. For example, modern development practices dictate that we separate our  site's functional and behavioral layers  server-side and client-side scripts   from our site's content structural layer  HTML markup . This concept is known  as unobtrusive JavaScript, and we'll delve into this best practice here in this  chapter. You'll see one of the more important ways of how MooTools makes us  write better JavaScript. But we're going to be covering more than just unobtrusive JavaScript. We're  going to work with classes, which is the design pattern of the entire MooTools  framework.  MooTools is structured into classes. In programming, a class is simply a  template of an object. A class can contain many methods or properties such as  normal variables or even references to other classes and objects. To understand how to write great MooTools code that adheres to best practices,  you have to understand its fundamental structure and the concept of classes,  which I must admit, can be confusing and hard to grok. If you know another programming language, especially an object-oriented one,  or a pseudo-object-oriented one like PHP  this is where I learned the concept of  a class , then the stuff we'll discuss here will look very familiar to you. You can  then compare and contrast the difference in syntax of classes in your particular  language. As an example, for you PHP folks out there, in PHP 5, we have the  __construct   function, which you'll soon see, is exactly like the initialize  method of a MooTools class.                                                                        Writing JavaScript with MooTools  In this chapter we shall:  example  So let's get on with it!    Learn how MooTools helps us write unobtrusive JavaScript   Work with classes by creating our own class   See how MooTools works by exploring a couple of classes   Learn about the concept of chainability by working through a simple animation   Writing unobtrusive JavaScript with MooTools  Unobtrusive JavaScript is a set of techniques and principles for writing code that's  separated from your web page's structure.  It's best to learn about unobtrusive JavaScript by way of example.  An "obtrusive" JavaScript example In this example, you'll see JavaScript code that works perfectly fine but doesn't adhere  to unobtrusive JavaScript principles. The script contains a function called mouseClick    that, when triggered, opens up an alert dialog box with the message, You clicked me!.  The HTML markup is a simple unordered list of links. The hyperlinks   are assigned an  onclick attribute which triggers the mouseClick   function when you click on them.                A simple function that opens an alert dialog box with a message       function mouseClick     {     alert  'You clicked me!'  ;   }             Home       About       Contact          [ 26 ]                                                                        Chapter 2  What's so bad about it? If the script works as intended, then what's the big deal?  Imagine this scenario: you have a 30 page website and each web page has to have that list of  links; if you noticed, the unordered list     tag has an id attribute of nav, so let's pretend  that this is your site's primary navigation. You would have to go through all 30 pages to add  mouseClick   to the list of links found on each page. This would be very time consuming.  Don't repeat it if you don't have to That's a lot of repetition, and you'll be breaking a lot of MooTools' core developers' hearts  because they designed the framework with the Don't Repeat Yourself  DRY  principle.  If you have to manually implement that block of code, there's a big chance that   you'll commit an error that can result in your web pages rendering incorrectly or   behaving unexpectedly.  [ 27 ]                                                                        Writing JavaScript with MooTools It'll be hard to maintain Say that for some reason, you want to add something else to the onclick attributes of the  links  like calling another function  or remove it entirely. Whenever there's a change to the  onclick attribute, you'll have to go through each page and change them. That's not an ideal  situation, especially because by writing unobtrusively, you can sidestep this issue and write a  more maintainable code base.  It's a bad practice to have functionality in your content structure Modern web development best practices encourage separating your web page's   content structure  HTML  from its presentation  CSS  and behavior functionality    client-side server-side scripts . By relying on the onclick attribute, we're intermixing  our web page's structure with its behavior  opening a dialog box when the link is clicked .  Separating structure, style, and functionality goes back to maintainability; it allows us  to keep things separate so that we can work with each component individually without  affecting the other components. This involves taking out all inline event handlers  namely,  the onclick attribute on our   tags .  Adding on event handlers directly into the HTML could also cause memory leaks in Internet  Explorer and make adding multiple events of the same type impossible.  Time for action – rewriting our script unobtrusively Let's rewrite the previous example to follow unobtrusive JavaScript principles:  1.  First, we'll remove all the onclick attributes. By doing so, we've effectively  separated our website's functionality from its content structure. Here's the   revised code:       function mouseClick   {   alert  'You clicked me!'  ; }             Home       About    [ 28 ]                                                                        Chapter 2      Contact          2.	 Now remove the mouseClick   function; we don't need it anymore.                  Home       About       Contact        3.	  Include the MooTools framework and put our code inside  window.addEvent 'domready' .           window.addEvent 'domready', function   {      Our code will go in here } ;             Home       About       Contact          [ 29 ]                                                                        Writing JavaScript with MooTools  4.	 Add an event listener to all child links of  . You'll learn more about   event listeners in Chapter 5.           window.addEvent 'domready', function   {   $$ 'nav a' .addEvent 'click', function     {        The alert function will go in here   } ; } ;             Home       About       Contact          5.	 Put our alert   function back, inside the addEvent method.            window.addEvent 'domready', function   {   $$ 'nav a' .addEvent 'click', function     {     alert  'You clicked me!'  ;   } ; } ;        [ 30 ]                                                                        Chapter 2        Home       About       Contact          6.	 Save your work and open it in a web browser. Click on any link. It   should open up a dialog box just like in our obtrusive example.  Just like before, if you did it correctly, you should see a dialog box that says You clicked me!  What just happened? What we did was fix our poorly-written and obtrusive JavaScript example by rewriting   our code without the use of inline event handlers. We leaned on MooTools to help us   do this effortlessly by using the $$   function to select all   elements inside our    element and then added an unobtrusive click event listener handler.  Now we can go onto explore key aspects of what we just did.  [ 31 ]                                                                        Writing JavaScript with MooTools  Removing our inline event handlers  The first step we did was to remove all of our onclick attributes. This not only makes our  HTML and JavaScript leaner and cleaner, but we also effectively separated our web page's  structure from its functionality. Now, whenever we want to add, remove, or edit our event  handler for clicks, we just have to do it in one place—MooTools code.  Using the DOM to handle events In step 4, we leveraged the DOM to add events to our   elements, first matching  all elements in the DOM that match our criteria via the $$   function, namely all    elements that are the children of   element, which translates to  $$ 'nav a'   notice that we selected it using CSS selectors syntax . Then we call the  MooTools Element method, .addEvent  , gave it a click argument. The .addEvent    method with a click argument, in plain English, just says: add an event handler to perform  this function when a 'click' event is triggered.  function   {   alert  'You clicked me!'  ; }  Now, when we clicked on any link on our web page, the alert   function was triggered  and we saw a dialog box.  You'll learn plenty more about selecting DOM elements and adding event handlers in  Chapters 3 and 5 respectively. For now, suffice it to say that we were able to revolutionize  our "obtrusive" JavaScript code into something magnitudes better. Now, if we wanted to  later on remove the event handler, we just remove it from our MooTools script, instead of  going to multiple pages to remove the inline event handler.  Pop quiz – rewriting our script unobstrusively Which of the following statements is wrong?  1.  Unobtrusive JavaScript separates JavaScript from your content's structure. 2.  Unobtrusive JavaScript makes updating scripts easier. 3.  Unobtrusive JavaScript is exclusive to the MooTools framework. 4.  Unobtrusive JavaScript, oftentimes, can reduce the amount of code you    have to write.  [ 32 ]                                                                        Chapter 2  Alright, I think you've had more than your fair share of unobtrusive-ness, but if you  want to learn more, check out this URL: http:  www.onlinetools.org articles  unobtrusivejavascript .  Now it's time to move onto another topic: MooTools classes.  Creating MooTools classes  I've mentioned it, like, a million times already, but here I go again, MooTools is an  object-oriented web application framework. And what's OOP without classes? Not   OOP, that's for sure! MooTools is, to me, the only JavaScript library that effectively  implements and promotes the use of classes.   What the heck is a class? A class, in terms of object-oriented programming, is a definition of an object, or an object's  blueprint, its design, its structure, its template, I can go on, but I think you get the picture.  Classes are best described in real-world terms.  Real-world analogy Let's say our class is "Dog". A dog can have a lot of traits, such as its name, its type  for  example, Golden Retriever or Poodle , its age, and so on. In MooTools, these traits are called  options, which is an object that contains default key value pairs specific to a particular class.  A dog can also do a lot of things, such as bark, sit, or eat. In the context of JavaScript and  classes, these are called class methods. A method is a function for a particular class or  object. For example, myPoodle.bark   can mean that we make my poodle bark by  triggering the bark   method.  Let's create a Dog class in MooTools.  Creating a MooTools class We create a MooTools class using the following format:  var ClassName = new Class { properties } ;  So for our Dog class, here's what we'll start with:    var Dog = new Class    {       Implements is a class property       upon which other classes methods will be added     Implements : [ Options ],  [ 33 ]                                                                        Writing JavaScript with MooTools        Default options for our Dog    options : {      name : 'Barkee',      type : 'Poodle',      age : 4    },       initialize is a MooTools method constructor that executes the        following function whenever a new instance of a class is created    initialize : function  options      {      this.setOptions  options  ;   },        Create a method which when passed to a instance of Dog will        tell us our dog is barking.    bark : function      {      alert  this.options.name + ' is barking.'  ;    },       This method is similar to .bark   but will tell us our dog        is sitting.    sit : function      {      alert  this.options.name + ' is sitting.'  ;    }   } ;  That's a big code block, but let me break it down for you all. Let's go through what's going on  inside the Dog class.  The Implements property The Implements property basically tells our new class what other class properties methods  to include as part of our new class. Either its classes are created by us or our MooTools  classes  like Options and Events .  Options and Events are MooTools utility classes in the Class.Extras component of  MooTools. Class.Extras includes the Chain class  which queues up and executes one  function after the next  and Events class  which adds customizable events to a class . In our  case, we're giving our class the instruction to implement the Options class.  Implements : [ Options ]  [ 34 ]                                                                        Chapter 2  The Options class provides us a way to deal with setting default options for our class,  and automatically decides what options to overwrite and leave alone depending on what  parameters are passed to it.  It also includes the .setOptions   method which is the method that triggers the setting  of these options.  The options property The options property lets us set default options for our Dog class.     options : {      name : 'Barkee',      type : 'Poodle',      age : 4    },  For example, if we don't pass a name option value when we create an instance of the Dog  class, then it's assumed that our dog's name is "Barkee". Likewise, if we don't pass a value for  type, then we're going to assume that it's a "Poodle"  and if your dog is really a Chihuahua, it  might get offended, so be sure you set the right type .  The initialize method The initialize method executes the code block; it's paired with when a new instance of your  class is created. In our example, we definitely want to set our class options  name, type, and  age , so we write:     initialize : function  options      {      this.setOptions  options  ;   }  Remember we implemented the Options class earlier? Well, in doing so, we get access  to the .setOptions   method which does all the hard work of merging our options for  us. For example, we don't have to check using if conditional statements, whether there is  or isn't value passed for name or type, and declare what to do in the case that they are or  aren't passed—it just does it for us. It sets the options to this instance.  Our own Dog class methods: .bark   and .sit   For our class, we create two methods, .bark   and .sit  . When we trigger them from  an instance of Dog, they'll tell us that our dog is either barking or sitting, respectively.  Alright, now that we've set up the template of the Dog class, it's time for you to try out the  Dog class.  [ 35 ]                                                                        Writing JavaScript with MooTools  Time for action – creating an instance of Dog Let's create an instance of a Dog class by deploying the following the steps:  1.  Create an HTML document for this. Use the following code taken from our Dog class.               var Dog = new Class    {     Implements : [ Options ],     options : {      name : 'Barkee',      type : 'Poodle',      age : 4    },     initialize : function  options      {      this.setOptions  options  ;    },     bark : function      {      alert  this.options.name + ' is barking.'  ;    },     sit : function      {      alert  this.options.name + ' is sitting.'  ;    }   } ;            [ 36 ]                                                                        Chapter 2  Apart from taking out the comments, referencing the MooTools framework, and  putting in the basic tags for an HTML document, nothing has changed so far.  2.  Create an instance of our Dog class, you can call the class instance anything  you like, but I'll call mine simply myDog. Place the following code right below  our class declaration. var myDog = new Dog { } ;  You've now created an instance of Dog, but we didn't declare any values for  options properties, so the options for myDog will be set to our default values  that we declared in the class.  3.	 Let's make myDog bark. Right below the code that we just wrote, place the following   code, which will pass the .bark   method to myDog: myDog.bark  ;  4.	 Save your work and preview the HTML document in the web browser. It should   immediately open up a dialog box like this:  [ 37 ]                                                                        Writing JavaScript with MooTools  What just happened? We just created a new instance of the Dog class called myDog. We didn't give myDog  any replacement options, so it used as the default option in our class. When we used the  .bark   method on myDog, it alerted us that "Barkee", the default name, "is barking".  If you followed along, this is the entire code you should have thus far:               var Dog = new Class    {     Implements : [ Options ],     options : {      name : 'Barkee',      type : 'Poodle',      age : 4    },     initialize : function  options      {      this.setOptions  options  ;    },     bark : function      {      alert  this.options.name + ' is barking.'  ;    },     sit : function      {      alert  this.options.name + ' is sitting.'  ;    }   } ;    var myDog = new Dog { } ;   myDog.bark  ;            [ 38 ]                                                                        Chapter 2  Have a go hero – use the .sit   class method We still haven't used the .sit   method. Why don't you modify our example to use the  .sit   method on myDog instead of .bark  ?  Time for action – giving our class instance some  custom options Let's give some custom options to our class by deploying the following:  1.	 Go back to the source code of the HTML document you just created. Go to the   var myDog = new Dog { } ; line.  2.	 Pass property values to name, type, and age like so:  var myDog = new Dog {   name : 'Zensis',   type : 'German Sheperd',   age : 10 } ;  3.	 Open your HTML document in the web browser, and now, you should see   something like this:  [ 39 ]                                                                        Writing JavaScript with MooTools  Time for action – determining the value of our options The following steps help us to determine the value of our options:  1.	 Right below where we use the .bark   method on myDog, type in the   following code: document.write  'My dog\'s name is ' + myDog.options.name +    '. ' ; document.write  'My dog is a ' + myDog.options.type + '. ' ; document.write  'My dog is ' + myDog.options.age +    ' years old. ' ;  2.	 Open up your HTML document on the web browser, and after you exit out of the   dialog box that .bark   calls, you should see something like this:  Extending classes Oftentimes, you'll want to extend a class with another class. For example, we might want to  extend our Dog class with a class for show dogs that may use the same options, but may do  other special things.  We can extend classes with the Extends property. Extends is a property specifically  for classes, that not only inherits properties and methods from a parent class, it makes   all parent methods available inside a method.  [ 40 ]                                                                        Chapter 2  Time for action – extending the ShowDog class with  the Dog class Let's see how we can extend our Dog class using the Extends property:  1.	 Let's clean up the Dogs class first by removing the things we don't need   any more to tidy up our code. We'll delete the .sit   class method,  the myDog.bark   call, and the document.write's that we used to  show the option property values of myDog. Here's our revised code:             window.addEvent 'domready', function   {   var Dog = new Class    {     Implements : [ Options ],     options :    {      name : 'Barkee',      type : 'Poodle',      age : 4    },     initialize : function  options      {      this.setOptions  options  ;    },     bark : function      {      alert  this.options.name + ' is barking.'  ;    }   } ; } ;      [ 41 ]                                                                        2.	 Create the ShowDog class right below the Dog class. Use the following code:  Writing JavaScript with MooTools           var ShowDog = new Class    {     Extends : Dog,     options :    {      name : 'Xythian'    },     initialize : function  options      {      this.parent  options  ;      alert  'I\'m no ordinary dog!'  ;      document.write  'My name is ' + this.options.name + ' ' ;      document.write  'I\'m a ' + this.options.type + ' ' ;      document.write  'I\'m ' + this.options.age + ' ' ;    }   } ;  3.	  Instantiate a new ShowDog object, like so: var myOtherDog = new ShowDog  ;  We now have the myOtherDog object, which is an instance of the ShowDog class  that extends the Dog class.  4.	 Test your HTML document in a browser, and if everything went   according to plan, then you should see the following:  [ 42 ]                                                                        Chapter 2  Then, the next thing you would see is as shown:  What just happened? We extended the ShowDogs class with the Dogs class. We did this by using the special  class property called Extends, which allows us to assign it the class we're extending it with.  Before we move onto the next topic, we should go over class inheritance a little bit.  Class inheritance Note that the ShowDogs class takes on properties and methods of its parent class  Dogs   if we don't explicitly define them.  [ 43 ]                                                                        Writing JavaScript with MooTools  For example, since we already defined an Implements property in Dogs, we need not do it  again for ShowDogs. We explicitly defined the name option value  Xythian , when we print  the value of it in the document, using the following line:  document.write  'My name is ' + this.options.name + ' ' ;  It printed "My name is Xythian".  However, we didn't explicitly define the type and age option values that we created in  the parent class when we performed the following:  document.write  'I\'m a ' + this.options.type + ' ' ; document.write  'I\'m ' + this.options.age + ' ' ;  The values took on the default property values we set in Dogs  Poodle, and 4 .  Have a go hero – doing more with the thing Why don't you try using the .bark   method that's in the Dog class on the myOtherDog  object? What happens? Did it behave like you expected it to?  Using MooTools classes  Now that you know how to create a class in MooTools, it'll be a piece of cake to use the  already-existing classes in the MooTools framework. You've already used a MooTools class,  whether you know it or not, with the Options class that we implemented in the Dogs class.  Let's look at another class, the Chain class, so that we can explore how to use MooTools  classes. And we're going to hit three birds with one stone here: by covering the Chain  class to see how MooTools classes work in general, you'll also discover a key concept in the  MooTools framework—chainability, and be able to witness the power of the Chain class.  Once we're done, it'll be a cinch to use other MooTools classes such as Fx class for animation  effects  we'll cover in greater detail in a later chapter .  The concept of chainability Alright, so you caught me, chainability isn't a real word. Chainability refers to MooTools'  ability to chain functions in sequence. It follows the concept of a Stack, a data structure that  follows the principle of "last in, first out". Chaining allows you to create a stack of functions  that you can execute in sequential order.  [ 44 ]                                                                        Chapter 2  The Chain class The Chain class, as you would expect, is a class for dealing with a chain of functions. It  contains the following useful methods:    .chain  —pushes one or more functions onto a chain stack   .callChain  —executes the highest stack order function in our chain stack   .clearChain  —clears our chain stack  A Chain example Let's set up an example for showcasing the concept of chaining and the abilities of the  Chain class. We're going to create a box using a   element that has a width and height  of 50px and a background color of blue  hexadecimal value of 00f . For convenience, we're  going to break my rule of separating style and structure that I discussed in the beginning of  this chapter by declaring an inline style attribute. Here's our HTML markup for the    element:  <div id="box" style="background-color: 00f; height:50px;  width:50px;">&nbsp;   Avoid using inline styles. It's a bad practice, and though development best  practices for style and content separation is beyond the scope of this book,  I'll make all the efforts I can in advocating the use of best practices. We'll  break this rule in this case so that we're focused on the topic at hand and not  our CSS and HTML.  Now that we have a nice   box to work with, what are we going to do with it?  A look ahead: Chaining Fx .Tween I don't think I can let you read any more chapters without seeing some cool animation  effects. So I'm going to cheat a bit  I hope the editors of this book don't notice that I snuck  in some animation effects in this chapter , and jump ahead to use a Fx.Tween class, except  that it's just like any other class in MooTools and that it deals with taking two CSS property  values and transitions between them.  This is what we're going to do:  1.  Move the blue box to the right by tweening its left margin. 2.  Double its width  100px . 3.  Fade it out. 4.  Fade it back in. 5.  Tween it back to its original position.  [ 45 ]                                                                        Writing JavaScript with MooTools  We're going to do this by chaining these four methods one after the other.  Let's write out the methods now:  .start 'margin-left', 150  .start 'width', 100  .start opacity, 0  .start opacity, 1  .start 'margin-left', 0   Alright, so we have our HTML markup set up and we already know what methods we're  going to stack. Let's get your chain on!  Time for action – create a chain of Fx.Tween methods Let's see how to create a chain of Fx.Tween methods by carrying out the following steps:  1.	 Create a new HTML document like we always do. It should have the following code:             window.addEvent 'domready', function   {   } ;       <div id="box" style="background-color: 00f; height:50px;  width:50px;">&nbsp;       2.	 Create a new object called boxAnimation, an instance of the Fx.Tween class,   and giving it the target of our box element, which has an id of box, using the  following code in our domready event handler: var boxAnimation = new Fx.Tween  $ 'box'   ;  [ 46 ]                                                                        3.	 Now that we have our boxAnimation object, let's apply the first method    moving it to the right by adjusting the left margin  by entering this line of code: boxAnimation.start  'margin-left', 150  ;  4.	 We'll pause here and test our work. Save your document, and open it up in your   web browser. You should see the following animation:  Chapter 2  Then, you will see the following animation:  5.	 Now, we'll add the second method, and we'll chain it to the previous method. That   way, as soon as the first method gets completed, it will start our next method. Here's   how to do it: boxAnimation.start  'margin-left', 150     .chain function     {    boxAnimation.start  'width', 100  ;   }   [ 47 ]                                                                        Writing JavaScript with MooTools  6.	 You can save and test your work if you wish. If you execute our script, you'll see two   consecutive animation effects move to the right and then increase width. This   should be what you end up with:  7.	 Let's add the rest of our chain methods, and this is what we should end up with:    .chain function     {    boxAnimation.start  'width', 100  ;   }   .chain function    {    boxAnimation.start 'opacity', 0 ;  }   .chain function    {    boxAnimation.start 'opacity', 100 ;  }   .chain function    {    boxAnimation.start 'margin-left', 0 ;  } ;  Here's the full sequence of the animation:  [ 48 ]                                                                        Chapter 2  The next goes like this:  Then comes the following:  [ 49 ]                                                                        Writing JavaScript with MooTools  The next in the slide happens to be like the following:  The next slide looks like the following:  Lastly, the one aligned to the left:  [ 50 ]                                                                        Chapter 2  What just happened? Here, we just learned about how to create and instantiate an object of a MooTools class   Fx.Tween , and learned how to use a method provided to us by another MooTools class   Chain  using the .chain   method.  Isn't MooTools classy? By working through an example of how to chain methods in Fx.Tween together  we chained  the .start   method which is actually in the Fx class and is available to classes that extend  Fx, such as Fx.Morph , we're able to see the fundamental structure of MooTools. Its design  is very class-based, and we work with objects by creating a blueprint, a template, and so  on—oh here I go again!  Chainability We saw the concept of chaining in this example, and how we can trigger methods one after  the other on the same object  in our example, boxAnimation .  It doesn't seem so special now, especially since we're just moving and resizing a box, but  once we get into the thick of things, like making asynchronous server-side calls where we  need to fire off functions in a sequence based on the state returned by our server, you'll  see just exactly how great chaining is.  Have a go hero – doing more with chaining Fx.Tween methods You can try to add or remove chained methods and experiment with different CSS properties.  Perhaps you'll want to transition the background color to red  F00  or adjust the height to  double its size  to 100px .  Summary  In this chapter we learned about:    The concept of unobtrusive JavaScript. We did this by creating an "obtrusive"   example and then reworked into an unobtrusive and more elegant solution.    The concept of classes. We created our own class, explored it, and even extended   it with another class. This gives us the basis of the structure and design of the  MooTools framework.    We learned the basics of using a class in MooTools. We used the Fx.Tween and   Chain class to animate a blue box.    Chainability: We discovered how we can chain methods one after another and   execute them in sequence.  [ 51 ]                                                                        Writing JavaScript with MooTools  Though we covered a lot of theories in this chapter, it was necessary to give us a solid  foundation for the next chapters and to give us a full understanding of how to write good  MooTools code. Anyone can hack and dice with MooTools, but you now possess the  knowledge of writing MooTools code that you can be proud of.  Now that we have some understanding of how to write JavaScript with MooTools, we are  going to move right along with the thing you'll be doing the most of with MooTools, selecting  and manipulating things in the Document Object Model.  [ 52 ]                                                                        3  Selecting DOM Elements  In the last chapter, we learned about the MooTools syntax as well as   JavaScript best practices. More specifically, we discussed unobtrusive   JavaScript and how we should separate our structure  HTML  from our  website's behaviors  JavaScript . In order to successfully and effortlessly write unobtrusive JavaScript, we must  have a way to point to the Document Object Model  DOM  elements  that we want to manipulate. The DOM is a representation of objects in our  HTML and a way to access and manipulate them. In traditional JavaScript,   this involves a lot  like, seriously a lot  of code authoring, and in many  instances, a lot of head-banging-against-wall-and-pulling-out-hair as you  discover a browser quirk that you must solve. Let me save you some bumps, bruises, and hair by showing you how to   select DOM elements the MooTools way. This chapter will cover how you   can utilize MooTools to select match simple elements  like, "All div elements"    up to the most complex and specific elements  like, "All links that are   children of a span that has a class of awesomeLink and points to  http:  superAwesomeSite.com" .  In this chapter we will look at:    The $   and $$   functions   Selecting HTML elements with pseudo-class selectors   Selecting HTML elements based on their attributes  So let's get on with it!                                                                        Selecting DOM Elements  MooTools and CSS selectors  MooTools selects an element  or a set of elements  in the DOM using CSS selectors syntax.  Just a quick refresher on CSS terminology; a CSS style rule consists of:  selector {   property: property value;  }    selector—indicates what elements will be affected by the style rule   property—refers to the CSS property  also referred to as attribute . For   example, color is a CSS property, so is font-style. You can have multiple  property declarations in one style rule.    property value—the value you want assigned to the property. For example,   bold is a possible CSS property value of the font-weight CSS property.  For example, if you wanted to select a paragraph element with an ID of awesomeParagraph  to give it a red color  in hexadecimal, this is ff0 , in CSS syntax you'd write:  Also, if I wanted to increase its specificity and make sure that only paragraph elements  having an ID of awesomeParagraph are selected:  awesomeParagraph {   color: ff0;  }  pawesomeParagraph {   color: ff0; }  You'll be happy to know that this same syntax ports over to MooTools. What's more is that  you'll be able to take advantage of all of CSS3's more complex selection syntax because even  though CSS3 isn't supported by all browsers yet, MooTools supports them already. So you  don't have to learn another syntax for writing selectors; you can use your existing knowledge  of CSS. Awesome, isn't it?  [ 54 ]                                                                        Working with the $   and $$   functions  The $   and $$   functions are the bread and butter of MooTools. When you're working  with unobtrusive JavaScript, you need to specify which elements you want to operate on.  The dollar and dollars functions help you do just that, they will allow you to specify what  elements you want to work on.  Chapter 3  Notice, the dollar sign $ is shaped like an S, which we can interpret  to mean 'select'.  The $   dollar function The dollar function is used for getting an element by its ID, which returns a single element  that is extended with MooTools Element methods or null if nothing matches. Let's go back to  awesomeParagraph in the earlier example. If I wanted to select awesomeParagraph, this  is what I would write:  $ 'awesomeParagraph'   By doing so, we can now operate on it by passing methods to the selection. For example, if  you wanted to change its style to have a color of red, you can use the .setStyle   method  which allows you to specify a CSS property and its matching property value, like:  $ 'awesomeParagraph' .setStyle 'color', 'ff0' ;  The $$   dollars function The $$  function is the big brother of $    that's why it gets an extra dollar sign . The  $$   function can do more robust and complex selections, can select a group, or groups of  elements and always returns an array object, with or without selected elements in it.  Likewise, it can be interchanged with the dollar function. If we wanted to select  awesomeParagraph using the dollars function, we would write:  $$ 'awesomeParagraph'   Note that you have to use the hash sign    in this case as if you were using CSS selectors.  [ 55 ]                                                                        Selecting DOM Elements  When to use which If you need to select just one element that has an ID, you should use the $   function  because it performs better in terms of speed than the $$   function.  Use the $$   function to select multiple elements. In fact, when in doubt, use the $$    function because it can do what the $   function can do  and more .  A note on single quotes  '  versus double quotes  "  The example above would work even if we used double quotes such as  $ "awesomeParagraph"  or $$ "awesomeParagraph" , but  many MooTools developers prefer single quotes so they don't have to escape  characters as much  since the double quote is often used in HTML, you'll have  to do \" in order not to prematurely end your strings . It's highly recommended  that you use single quotes, but hey, it's your life!  Now, let's see these functions in action. Let's start with the HTML markup first. Put the  following block of code in an HTML document:                   List item          List item link          List item with an ID.         Last list item.             What we have here is an unordered list. We'll use it to explore the dollar and dollars  function. If you view this in your web browser, you should see something like this:  [ 56 ]                                                                        Chapter 3  Time for action – selecting an element with the dollar function Let's select the list item with an ID of listItem and then give it a red color using the  .setStyle   MooTools method.  1.   Inside your window.addEvent 'domready'  method, use the following code: $ 'listItem' .setStyle 'color', 'red' ;  2.	 Save the HTML document and view it on your web browser.   You should see the third list item in red.  3.	 Now let's select the entire unordered list  it has an ID of superList ,   then give it a black border  in hexadecimal, this is 000000 . Place  the following code, right below the line we wrote in step 1: $ 'superList' .setStyle 'border', '1px solid 000000' ;  4.	  If you didn't close your HTML document, hit your browser's  refresh button. You should now see something like this:  [ 57 ]                                                                        Selecting DOM Elements  Time for action – selecting elements with the dollars function We'll be using the same HTML document, but this time, let's explore the dollars function:  1.  We're going to select the last list item  it has a class of lastItem . Using the   .getFirst  , we select the first element from the array $$   returned. Then,  we're going to use the .get   method to get its text. To show us what it is,  we'll pass it to the alert   function. The code to write to accomplish this is: alert  $$ '.lastItem' .getFirst  .get 'text'   ;  2.  Save the HTML document and view it in your web browser  or just hit your browser's   refresh button if you still have the HTML document from the preview Time for  action open . You should now see the following:  Time for action – selecting multiple sets of elements  with the dollars function What if we wanted to select multiple sets of elements and run the same method  or  methods  on them? Let's do that now.   1.  Let's select the list item that has an   element inside it and the last list item    class="lastItem" , and then animate them to the right by transitioning  their margin-left CSS property using the .tween   method.  2.  Right below the line we wrote previously, place the following line: $$ 'li a, .lastItem' .tween 'margin-left', '50px' ;  [ 58 ]                                                                        3.  View your work in your web browser. You should see the second and last list   item move to the right by 50 pixels.  Chapter 3  What just happened? We explored the dollar and dollars functions to see how to select different elements   and apply methods to them. You just learned to select:    An element with an ID  listItem and superList  using the dollar $   function   An element with a class  .lastItem  using the dollars $$   function   Multiple elements by separating them with commas  li, a, and .lastItem    You also saw how you can execute methods on your selected elements. In the  example, we used the .setStyle  , .getFirst  , .get  , and .tween    MooTools methods.  Because DOM selection is imperative to writing MooTools code, before we go any further,  let's talk about some important points to note about what we just did.  $   versus document.getElementById   When we used the $   dollar function, it's equivalent to using the .getElementById    native JavaScript method. The difference is that using .getElementById   ends up with  longer code and, in Internet Explorer, elements returned by .getElementById   are not  extended with MooTools Element methods.   If we wanted to perform the same operation using JavaScript's .getElementById  ,  instead of:  $ 'listItem' .setStyle 'color', 'red' ;  [ 59 ]                                                                        Selecting DOM Elements  We would first have to declare an object that will contain our desired DOM element, like:  var listItem = document.getElementById 'listItem' ;  But we have to extend the element with MooTools Element methods, or else setStyle  will not be available. So we'll change the code a tiny bit:  var listItem = $ document.getElementById ;  Then we'd pass the .setStyle   method on our object:  listItem.setStyle 'color', 'red' ;  Can we all agree that we just saved a lot of typing and that we can worry less about   browser issues that may occur using the .getElementById   method? I think we can!  Selecting multiple sets of elements In step 2 of Time for action – selecting multiple sets of elements with the dollars function,  we selected two sets of elements using one $$   function; we matched all   tags inside a  list item   and all elements with the class of lastItem.  What we did in step 2 is the same as writing:  $$ 'li a' .tween 'margin-left', '50px' ; $$ '.lastItem' .tween 'margin-left', '50px' ;  Because one of MooTools' key design principles is to avoid repeating yourself  remember  "DRY" in Chapter 2 , you use the $$   function if you will be performing the same  operations on the sets of elements, by separating your selection strings with a comma  , .  You can have as many sets of elements as you want.  Have a go hero – tween the list item element Here's a good point to modify the example we wrote together. Try adding the list item with  an ID of lastItem to the set of elements that used the .tween   method to transition to  the left. If you did it correctly, the third list item should also move to the left when you test  the script.  [ 60 ]                                                                        Chapter 3  Common errors with the dollar and dollars functions When selecting elements using the $$   function, the syntax is exactly like CSS selectors. For  example, if we wanted to select all instances of   that are inside a list item   tag and  give them a color of red, in CSS, we'd write:  li a {   color: red;  }  The same thing can be done in MooTools using the following line of code:  $$ 'li a' .setStyle 'color', 'red' ;  The dollar function doesn't work with CSS selectors! Note the use of an exclamation point here - and you should pause here for a moment,  close your eyes, and imagine me shouting this at the top of my lungs to make sure   everyone hears it.   The $   function doesn't work with CSS selectors like the $$   function does because it  only takes the ID name, and nothing else. CSS selectors can look like awesomeParagraph,  pawesomeParagraph, or .lastItem.  A common mistake that MooTools beginners make is trying to do this:  $ 'li a'   MooTools interprets the above line as:   "Select the element with the ID of 'li a'"   and not:  like we intended it to.  "Select all   elements that are inside a list item  "  [ 61 ]                                                                        Selecting DOM Elements  So what happens when you do this? If you don't have an element in your web page with the  ID of li a  which you shouldn't, because spaces are not allowed for IDs as part of HTML  standard spec , then $   will return null since an element with the id "li a" does not exist. Drop the pound  sign when using the $   function If you're going to use the $$   function to select an element with an ID of superList, you  have to write:  $$ 'superList'   Again, imagine you're writing CSS code; you wouldn't write:  superList {   border: 1px solid 000000; }  Instead, you'd write:  superList {   border: 1px solid 000000; }  But when you're selecting an element by its ID using the $   function, always remember  to leave out the hash    sign because, like I said earlier, the $   function doesn't work with  CSS selectors.  For example, you'll be disappointed by a JavaScript error if you write this code:  $ 'superList' .setStyle 'border', '1px solid 000000' ;  It won't work because you would be selecting an element with an ID name of superList  and not superList like you intended.  Pop quiz – find the bad apple in the bunch Which of the following selection operations won't work?  1.  $$ 'ul li a span'  2.  $$ '.myClass', 'p.indentedText', 'myID'  3.  $ 'myID'  4.  $ "thisID"   [ 62 ]                                                                        Chapter 3  Selection using pseudo-classes  MooTools' selection awesomeness is further awesome'ized in its ability to utilize  pseudo-classes. Pseudo-class selectors are special selectors that allow you to find items  from the DOM using properties that can't be easily deduced using ordinary ID, class, tag, or  attribute selectors. Psuedo-class selection will allow you to write complex selection strings;  ones that would involve a ton of code if you were to write them in native JavaScript syntax.  A pseudo-class, in CSS3 specifications, allows you to select DOM elements that are difficult to  select using normal selectors. The pseudo-class concept was introduced as part of CSS3  specifications by the W3C organization  the people in charge of establishing web standards .  Using a pseudo-class is simple, and follows the format:  :pseudo-classname  Or  : pseudo-classname   You can read more about the concept of pseudo-classes from the W3C CSS3  Selectors Level 3 Working Draft at http:  www.w3.org TR css3-selectors pseudo-classes  MooTools has a plethora of pseudo-class selectors that you can readily use, such as  :contains   pseudo-class which searches for elements containing a certain string of text.  For example, to find all paragraphs that have the text MooTools is l33t, you would write:  $$ 'p:contains MooTools is l33t '   If you've ever tried writing a similar piece of code using native JavaScript, you'll know   exactly how much pseudo-classes will help you save some time and keep your sanity.  Pseudo-class example: Zebra striping a table Let's see what pseudo-class selection can do with an example. In the following section, we're  going to "zebra stripe" an HTML table, which basically means we're going to make the rows  of our table alternate between two colors. Zebra striping a table is usually done to make  HTML tables with a lot of data more readable.  [ 63 ]                                                                        Selecting DOM Elements  Time for action – using pseudo-classes to zebra stripe a table Let's set up the markup for our HTML table. It'll have three columns and six rows listing my  favorite movies in order.  Pseudo-class example HTML table markup:                   Rank       Movie       Genre               1       The Matrix       Action               2       Die Hard       Action               3       The Dark Knight       Action               4       Friday       Comedy               5       Love Actually       Drama           [ 64 ]                                                                        Our HTML table should look like this:  Chapter 3  1.  To color even rows with a light gray color, write this line of code  again, we use the .  setStyle   method : $$ 'table tr:even' .setStyle  'background-color', 'ebebeb'  ;  2.  Save your work. View your document in a web browser. You should see something   like this:  [ 65 ]                                                                        Selecting DOM Elements  3.  Now we're going to style the odd rows. This time, instead of .setStyle  , we're  going to use the .setStyles   method so that we can supply more than one CSS  property CSS property value pair to be implemented. Here's the code to accomplish  what we set out to do  which you can place right below the code in step 1 :   $$ 'table tr:odd' .setStyles  {     'background-color' : '252525',     'color' : 'ffffff'   }  ;  4.  Save and view your work in a web browser. Your HTML table that contains my   favorite movies of all time should now look like this:  What just happened? We learned one of the many ways in which pseudo-class selectors are helpful. In this  case, we took a regular HTML table and zebra striped it so that we have different styles   at alternating rows.   To zebra stripe our HTML table, we used the :even and :odd pseudo-class selectors to  change the background color of even rows with a light gray color  ebebeb in hexadecimal   and all odd rows of our tables with a dark gray background  252525  with a white  foreground color  ffffff .  [ 66 ]                                                                        Chapter 3  A couple of notes on the :odd and :even pseudo-class selectors The :odd and :even pseudo-classes aren't available in W3C specifications;  although the concept of using them is the same, they are custom MooTools  pseudo-class selectors. Secondly, the index of each one starts at 0. Because of this, using :even would  select the first element  index 0  and third child elements because their index  is actually 0 and 2, respectively. So they're kind of switched around in the  conventional sense of odd and even.  Other pseudo-class selectors There are nine MooTools pseudo-class selectors as of version 1.2:  Pseudo-class selector Description :contains  :empty  :enabled :even  :first-child  :last-child  :not  Matches elements that contain a particular text string. For example, matching all  's with the text I love MooTools is  $$ 'div:contains I love MooTools ' . Matches elements that don't contain anything. For example, $$ div:empty  would match this:   . Matches elements that are enabled. Usually used in   tags. Matches all child elements that have an even index. For example, if there are four paragraphs, using $$ 'p:even'   would select the first and third paragraphs  remember that the index  starts at 0 . Matches the first child element  that is, the child with an index of 0 . For example, if there are four paragraphs in a   element, using  $$ 'div p:first-child'  would select the first paragraph  inside the   element. Matches the last child element  that is, the child with the highest  index . For example, if there are four paragraphs in a   element,  using $$ 'div p:last-child'  will select the fourth  paragraph inside the   element. Matches elements that do not match a particular selector. For example, matching all paragraphs that do not have the class  .intro would be $$ 'p:not .intro ' .  [ 67 ]                                                                        Selecting DOM Elements  Pseudo-class selector Description :nth-child  Matches the nth expression child element. You can use mathematical  expressions.  For example, $$ 'div:nth-child 3n+1 '  would select the first  div  3 0 +1 = index 0 position , 4th div  3 1 +1 = index 4 position …  3 n +1 index position.   You can also use, as an argument: even, odd, first, and last  as in div:nth-child even  which is exactly like the :even  pseudo-class selector. Matches all child elements with an odd index.  For example, if there are four paragraphs, using $$ 'p:odd'   would select the second paragraph and fourth paragraph    index 1 position and index 3 position . Matches all elements that are the only children of the only  child element.  For example, $$ p:only-child  would match the paragraph    only child>  , but will not match these  paragraphs  > not an only child> > not  only child>   because it has a sibling paragraph.  :odd  :only-child  Working with attribute selectors  If you thought MooTools can't get any cooler with element selection, well, it gets much  better. MooTools also implements CSS3's attribute selectors. An attribute selector allows  you to select elements based on their CSS attributes, also commonly referred to as  "properties" in MooTools.   For example, an   tag's type is considered one of its attributes  or properties ,  so is its class.     In MooTools  as well as CSS3 , the syntax for an attribute selector is as follows:  element[attribute=attribute value]  For example, if we wanted to select all   elements with a type of text, we  would write:  $$ 'input[type=text]' ;  [ 68 ]                                                                        Attribute selector operators Attribute selectors can match attribute values in various ways using attribute selector  operators. The following table depicts a list and description of each attribute selector operator.  Chapter 3  Operator =  Description Matches attribute value exactly and literally.  !=  ^=  $=  For example, $$ 'a[class=myLinkClass]'  will match all   elements  with the class of myLinkClass. Matches all elements with the attribute value that is not the value given.  For example, $$ 'a[class!=myLinkClass]'  will select all   elements  that don't have the class of myLinkClass. Matches all elements with the attribute value that starts with the value given.  For example, $$ 'img[src^=big]'  will match all images with the src  attribute value that begin with the word big, such as big-picture.png or  biggiesmalls.jpg. Matches all elements with the attribute value that ends with the value given.  For example, $$ 'img[src$=.jpg]'  will select all images that end with  .jpg. Useful in selecting particular file extensions.  Attribute selector example: Styling different types of links Often, you want to indicate to a user what a particular type of link is. For example, you may  want to indicate to the user that a particular link goes to another website or that a link is a  mailto: link that will open up their default email client. Perhaps, you want to highlight all  links that point to a particular domain name like sixrevisions.com.  Time for action – using = attribute selector Let's see exactly what attribute selectors can do. In the following HTML markup, you'll see a  variety of links. Just pop this into an HTML document and we'll be good to go:       Go to the  home page .      This link  will not go to       the home page.     Please  email me  or      email Matt .     Download this  ZIP file .     [ 69 ]                                                                        Selecting DOM Elements  You should have something like this:  Let's style the first link with MooTools. Its href attribute goes to http:  mywebsite.com.  Let's say that we want all links in our web page to point to the site's home page, and they  will be a green color. We'll use the .setStyle   method to apply the style.  1.  To select all links in a web page that have the href attribute   of http:  mywebsite.com, we write: $$ 'a[href="http:  mywebsite.com"]' .setStyle 'color', '7cc576' ;  2.  Open up your HTML document in a web browser. You   should see that the first link is now green:  [ 70 ]                                                                        3.  Your JavaScript should look like this at this point:    window.addEvent 'domready', function  { $$ 'a[href="http:  mywebsite.com"]' .setStyle 'color', '7cc576' ; } ;    Chapter 3  Time for action – using != attribute selector Now, continuing with our example, we should try out the NOT  !=  attribute selector.  We're going to color all of the links in the web page that don't point to the home page   in red  9e0b0f .   1.  To color all links that don't go to http:  mywebsite.com, we write this after   our previous line of JavaScript: $$ 'a[href!="http:  mywebsite.com"]' .setStyle 'color',  '9e0b0f' ;  2.  Save your work and open or refresh your web browser to view what our   HTML document looks like now. You should see something like this:  3.  Your JavaScript should look like this at this point:    window.addEvent 'domready', function  { $$ 'a[href="http:  mywebsite.com"]' .setStyle 'color', '7cc576' ;  [ 71 ]                                                                        $$ 'a[href!="http:  mywebsite.com"]' .setStyle 'color',  '9e0b0f' ;  Selecting DOM Elements  } ;    Time for action – using ^= attribute selector For all hyperlinks that have the mailto: attribute value inside its href attribute, let's make  their underline dashed, and then give them a light blue color. This can give users a visual clue  that the link they're going to be clicking on will open up their default email client.  Since we have to set multiple CSS properties, we'll use the .setStyles   method.  1.  To select all links that start with the mailto: value in its href attribute, we write   the following after our previous line of JavaScript: $$ 'a[href^=mailto:]' .setStyles {       Remove link  underline first    'text-decoration' : 'none',       Add a dashed bottom border    'border-bottom' : '1px dashed 9e0b0f',       Set background color    'background-color' : '7da7d9'  } ;  2.  Open or refresh your HTML document. If all went according to plan, you should see   the two links with the mailto: attribute styled in a similar fashion, as the  screenshot below:  [ 72 ]                                                                        3.  Your JavaScript should look like this at this point:    window.addEvent 'domready', function  { $$ 'a[href="http:  mywebsite.com"]' .setStyle 'color', '7cc576' ;  Chapter 3  $$ 'a[href!="http:  mywebsite.com"]' .setStyle 'color',  '9e0b0f' ;  $$ 'a[href^=mailto:]' .setStyles {       Remove link  underline first    'text-decoration' : 'none',       Add a dashed bottom border    'border-bottom' : '1px dashed 9e0b0f',       Set background color    'background-color' : '7da7d9'  } ;  } ;    Time for action – using $= attribute selector Let's give the link that points to a ZIP file a different font style and a gray border by utilizing  the $= attribute selector. This can be helpful in distinguishing links that will prompt the user  to download a file from a web page.  1.   In order to give links that point to a ZIP file a different style, use the $= as follows,  after the previously entered JavaScript code: $$ 'a[href$=.zip]' .setStyles {       Remove link underline first    'text-decoration' : 'none',       Assign a different font style    'font' : 'bold 14px "Courier New"',       Give them some padding    'padding' : 2,      Add a solid gray border around the link    'border' : '1px solid 898989',      } ;  [ 73 ]                                                                        Selecting DOM Elements  2.  Open or refresh your web browser and you should see something like this:  3.	 Your JavaScript should look like this at this point:    window.addEvent 'domready', function  { $$ 'a[href="http:  mywebsite.com"]' .setStyle 'color', '7cc576' ;  $$ 'a[href!="http:  mywebsite.com"]' .setStyle 'color',  '9e0b0f' ;  $$ 'a[href^=mailto:]' .setStyles {       Remove link  underline first    'text-decoration' : 'none',       Add a dashed bottom border    'border-bottom' : '1px dashed 9e0b0f',       Set background color    'background-color' : '7da7d9'  } ;  $$ 'a[href$=.zip]' .setStyles {       Remove link underline first    'text-decoration' : 'none',       Assign a different font style    'font' : 'bold 14px "Courier New"',  [ 74 ]                                                                        Chapter 3        Give them some padding    'padding' : 2,      Add a solid gray border around the link    'border' : '1px solid 898989',      } ;  } ;    What just happened? We experienced how attribute selectors can help us write complex DOM selections. More  specifically, we:    Used the = attribute selector to select all links that point to  http:  mywebsite.com and assigned them a green color    Used the != attribute selector to select all links that don't point   to http:  mywebsite.com and gave them a red color    Used the ^= attribute selector to select all links that have an href attribute value  that begins with mailto: to give users a visual clue that when the link is clicked,  it will open up their default mail client; we gave these links a dashed underline   and light blue background.    Used the $= attribute selector to select all links that have an href attribute value   the end in .zip to distinguish links that point to ZIP files; we gave these links a  different font style and a gray border.  Attribute selector case sensitivity When using attribute selectors, the criteria values you give them are case-sensitive. For  example, in the example that uses http:  mywebsite.com as the criteria for the =  attribute selector, writing:  $$ 'a[href!="http:  MyWebsite.Com"]' .setStyle 'color', '9e0b0f' ;  This will not work! It's important to make sure you have the exact cases for the values you're  trying to match. You'll have to extend your selector if you want to match different strings.  A common problem is in file extensions. Many people will write .ZIP as well as .zip, so  your selector should look like this:  $$ 'a[href$=.zip], a[href$=.ZIP"]' .setStyles { ...     } ;  [ 75 ]                                                                        Selecting DOM Elements  Note that we just added another selector string that matches all links with an href attribute  value that ends in .ZIP.  DOM selection makes unobtrusive JavaScript do-able  Throughout this chapter, we've just seen how to create very narrow and refined DOM  element selections. This will enable us to pinpoint exactly the elements we need to   operate on.  What this means is that we're able to write JavaScript without touching our HTML markup.  We simply have to hone into the elements we want to work on using the selection  techniques we learned in this chapter.  Summary  In this chapter we learned about:    The $   and $$   functions: how to use them to select DOM elements   Pseudo-class selectors: how to use them to select otherwise difficult    sets of DOM elements such as "all even rows of a table"    Attribute selectors: how to further refine our selections by matching attribute    otherwise known as properties  values of elements in the DOM  We also discussed how the $$  function uses a similar syntax to CSS selectors, common  mistakes to avoid in using the dollar and dollars functions, as well as the case sensitivity of  attribute selector criteria.  Now that we've learned about selecting DOM elements, we'll learn other things we can   do to manipulate the DOM to our will  cue evil 'muhahaha' laughter , and that's in the   next chapter.  [ 76 ]                                                                        4  The Core's Useful Utility Functions  In this chapter, we'll be investigating the MooTools Core component which  contains a collection of useful utility helper functions and properties that we  can use to write less code and obtain information about the browser client.  In this chapter we shall:    Learn about browser properties that MooTools makes available to us, and how    to use them to gain more data about our users    Explore the Core's utility functions in order to discover functions that will make   writing JavaScript easier  So let's get on with it!  What is the Core?  The Core is a MooTools component  Core.js  that contains a plethora of useful functions  that deal with common JavaScript tasks, such as checking if the objects are defined, and  merging the objects into one.  The Core is split into two sub-components: Browser, which gives you a set of tools for  acquiring information about the client accessing your scripts, and Core, which contains  a mixture of helpful functions for dealing with everyday JavaScript-related processes.                                                                        The Core's Useful Utility Functions  Browser: Getting information about the client  There are plenty of reasons why you would want to gain insight about the people viewing  your web pages. For example, if you'd like to determine what the most popular web browser  accessing your website web application is, or what operating system people use, then you  can use MooTools in conjunction with a server-side scripting language  like PHP , and a  database  like MySQL , to mine this information.  The Browser component can do three things:   1.  Determine whether a browser has a specific feature  Browser.Features  2.  What rendering engine  Browser.Engine  it uses  3.  What operating system  Browser.Platform  the client is running on  Determining if the client has a specific feature  MooTools can help you find out whether or not XPath  a querying language for XML  documents  or the XMLHTTP object  used for Ajax  are available in the client browser by  using Browser.Features.  Browser.Features.xpath Browser.Features.xpath returns a Boolean value  true or false .  By writing:  alert Browser.Features.xpath   You will be alerted whether or not the browser being used to view the web page   supports xPath.  Browser.Features.xhr Browser.Features.xhr works the same way as Browser.Features.xpath by  evaluating true if the browser supports the XMLHTTP object.  Getting information about the client's rendering engine A browser rendering engine, also known as a layout engine, is what the browser uses to  interpret markup  HTML  and formatting styles  CSS . For example, Microsoft's Internet  Explorer browser uses the Trident rendering engine and Mozilla Firefox uses the Gecko  rendering engine.  [ 78 ]                                                                        Chapter 4  Knowing the client's rendering engine will enable you to deal with browser quirks more  effectively using JavaScript-based techniques.  Let's go over some of the things Browser.Engine can do for us.  Determining the client's rendering engine and version Browser.Engine.name returns a string value of the name of the rendering engine.  Browser.Engine.version returns a string value of the version of the rendering engine.  Let's see these two in action.  Time for action – determining the client's rendering  engine and version We're going to check what rendering engine you're using. If you have several browsers  installed in your work station, try the same script in all of them:  1.  For the markup, you can use the following:           The rendering engine you're using is:        The rendering engine's version is:        2.  Open your HTML document in a browser to preview your work. You should see   the following figure  it shouldn't have the rendering engine information yet :  [ 79 ]                                                                        The Core's Useful Utility Functions  3.  We'll get information about the browser engine name and version using   Browser.Engine.name and Browser.Engine.version, and then assign  them to the variables browserEngine and browserEngineVersion.  If for some reason we can't determine the values, we assign them values  "Unknown" by using   which means "or" . To do this write:    var browserEngine = Browser.Engine.name  "Unknown";    var browserEngineVersion = Browser.Engine.version  "Unknown";  4.  Now we'll use the .appendText   method to add to the browserEngine   and browserEngineVersion at the end of their respective  paragraphs. Right below the code in step 3, do the following:      Selects the first paragraph    $$ 'browser-info p:first-child' .appendText browserEngine ;       Selects the last paragraph    $$ 'browser-info p:last-child'                                  .appendText browserEngineVersion ;  5.  Now refresh your browser. Depending on your web browser, you   should see something similar to one of the following:    Mozilla Firefox 3.0   [ 80 ]                                                                           Internet Explorer 7.0  Chapter 4     Safari 4.0 beta  6.  Your JavaScript should look like the following:    window.addEvent 'domready', function  { var browserEngine = Browser.Engine.name  'Unknown'; var browserEngineVersion = Browser.Engine.version  'Unknown';          Selects the first paragraph $$ 'browser-info p:first-child' .appendText browserEngine ;     Selects the last paragraph $$ 'browser-info p:last-child' .appendText browserEngineVersion ; }    [ 81 ]                                                                        The Core's Useful Utility Functions Checking if the client is using a particular web browser Browser.Engine can check what particular rendering engine the client is using. This is  especially helpful if you want to do something specifically for a particular browser, such as  serving a script to fix a browser rendering quirk for certain browsers.  The following block of code  for example , would display "You're using Internet Explorer" if  your MooTools detects the Trident layout engine.  if Browser.Engine.trident {    alert 'You\'re using Internet Explorer' ; } else{    alert 'You\'re not using Internet Explorer' ; }  In the following table, you will see the Browser.Engine properties for common rendering  engines and some of the browsers that use them. They return a Boolean value of either true  or false.  Property Browser.Engine.gecko  Rendering Engine Gecko  Presto Browser.Engine.presto Browser.Engine.trident Trident Browser.Engine.webkit WebKit  Some browsers that use it Mozilla Firefox, Flock, SeaMonkey,  K-Meleon, Netscape 9 Opera Internet Explorer Safari  Have a go hero – checking to see if your browser uses Gecko Why don't you try out the previous example to check for Gecko, which Mozilla-based  browsers  Firefox and SeaMonkey  use. Just change Browser.Engine.trident in the  if statement to the appropriate browser property.   Determining if the client has Adobe Flash installed If you work with Flash, it's often beneficial to check whether the client has the Flash plugin  installed, so that if they don't, you can perform an alternative action, such as displaying a  message with instructions on how to obtain the Flash plugin.  You can use Browser.Plugins.Flash.version to determine what version of Flash the  user has. If the property returns a null value, then the client doesn't have Flash installed.  [ 82 ]                                                                        Chapter 4  In the following example, if the client has the Flash plugin installed, it will output: "Flash  plugin detected and the version is: versionnumber" if MooTools can detect it.  if Browser.Plugins.Flash.version {    alert 'Flash plugin detected and the version is: '+Browser.Plugins. Flash.version ; } else{    alert 'Flash plugin not detected' ; } } ;  Alternatively, you can use Browser.Plugins.Flash.build to find out what the Flash  plugin build is.  Finding out information about the client's operating system Often, it's valuable to find out what operating system  Windows, Linux, Mac OS  the client  uses. The Browser.Platform property will allow us to do just that.  The following table showcases all the properties available for Browser.Platform:  Property Browser.Platform.mac  Platform Mac OS  What it will tell you Boolean. Will return true if the client uses  the Mac OS platform.  Browser.Platform.linux Linux-based Boolean. Will return true if the client uses   Browser.Platform.ipod  iPhone or  iPod touch  the Linux operating system. Boolean. Will return true if the client uses an  iPhone or iPod touch to access the web page.  Browser.Platform.other Other   Browser.Platform.name  platforms N A  Boolean. It will return true if the client's  platform is not any of the above platforms. String. Will return the name of the client's  platform.  Potential uses of this property You can gain information about your site's visitors by using this property in conjunction  with server-side scripting and a database.  Perhaps though, a common usage of "platform-sniffing" is when you're offering downloads  on your site and want to tailor the download page specifically to the client platform.  Wouldn't it be cool if you could change the page on-the-fly and customize the user  experience based on the operating system they're using?  [ 83 ]                                                                        The Core's Useful Utility Functions Example scenario: Offering the correct download based on the client's  platform Let's pretend that you're a software application developer and that you just created an  awesome application called SuperSoftware. There are multiple versions of it so that people  with the Windows, Mac OS, and Linux machines can use SuperSoftware.  Let's set up the markup first.  SuperSoftware HTML The HTML is simple; just a level 1 heading tag for the web page, a paragraph with  instructions  p class="instructions" , and an unordered list with download options   ul class="download-options" .        Download SuperSoftware       Select the download for your operating            system                  Windows XP Windows Vista             Mac OS X             Linux            Now we have our markup set up and the above figure is what our download page will look  like without CSS or JavaScript. People will still be able to access the download links without  JavaScript or CSS, but we should probably make it prettier with some CSS.  [ 84 ]                                                                        SuperSoftware CSS For styles, we just change the body background color, the default font family and colors, and  place a border at the bottom of our   tag to separate it from the page content.  Chapter 4  body {    background-color: e0e9f3;    font:normal 12px 14px Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;    color:333; } h1 {    font:normal 26px "Lucida Sans Unicode", "Lucida Grande",        sans-serif;    padding-bottom:5px;    letter-spacing:-2px;    border-bottom:1px solid 999; } a {    color:930; }  With just a few CSS style rules, our download page looks a bit better. Now it's time to  supercharge SuperSoftware's download page with MooTools!  [ 85 ]                                                                        The Core's Useful Utility Functions  Time for action – using Browser.Platform to customize  SuperSoftware's download page We'll use the Browser.Platform property to detect what platform the client uses so that  we can tailor the page based on the user's operating system.  1.  Let's figure out what the user's operating system is and put it in a variable called   userPlatform. The values will be of a string data type and will be of the following  values: win  for Windows , mac  for Mac OS , linux  for Linux machines , ipod   Apple iPhone and Apple iPod touch , and other  platform can't be detected  or is unrecognized . window.addEvent 'domready', function  {    var userPlatform = Browser.Platform.name; } ;  2.  Next, we build a function called pageCustomizer that will customize our page.   We'll pass userPlatform  later on  to it so that it knows what platform it'll  be working with. Let's set that up now: window.addEvent 'domready', function  {    var userPlatform = Browser.Platform.name;     Customizes download page depending on client's platform    var pageCustomizer = function platform  {          ...code goes here... } } ;  3.  pageCustomizer will have three local variables: platformNameFull which will   contain the full name of the platform, instructions, which will be assigned  instructions that are specific to a particular platform, and downloadURL, which is  the location of the file for the particular platform. We'll display all of these in the download page. Let's declare them now so that  they're ready to be used.     var pageCustomizer = function  platform  {       var platformNameFull = '';       var instructions = '';       var downloadURL = '';    }  [ 86 ]                                                                        Chapter 4  4.  Next, we need a control structure. We'll use if else statements to give   platformNameFull and instructions the appropriate values.          Control structure       if platform == 'win'  {        } else if platform == 'mac'  {        } else if platform == 'linux'  {        } else {             If the platform is iPod or other       }  5.  Let's assign values for platformNameFull and instructions. You can assign them   any string values, but this is what I used:                Control stucture       if platform == 'win'  {          platformNameFull = ' for Windows XP Vista';          instructions = 'We recommend installing SuperSoftware in                            C:\\Program Files';          downloadURL = 'win.zip';       } else if platform == 'mac'  {          platformNameFull = 'for Mac OS X';          instructions = ' Mac OS X users should be aware of a              minor bug in SuperSoftware.               See this page for details. ';          downloadURL = 'mac.zip';       } else if platform == 'linux'  {          platformNameFull = 'for Linux';          instructions = ' Ubuntu users may experience some                            sluggishness with SuperSoftware.';          downloadURL = 'linux.zip';       } else {          instructions = 'We couldn\'t detect your operating             system. Please select a compatible download link below';       }  6.  Let's manipulate the   tag to display the operating system we detected.        Display full name of platform.    $$ 'h1' .appendText platformNameFull ;  [ 87 ]                                                                        The Core's Useful Utility Functions  Our first page customization is done! Here's what our page looks like now in a  Windows platform  notice the title page has changed to display the full name of   the platform .  7.  Next, we need to display the custom instructions. We'll replace the text inside <p   id="instructions"> with the value inside the instructions variable.  We use the .set   method for this, which takes two arguments: the property  you want to target, and the value you want to set it to. We want to the target   instructions HTML property and set it equal to the contents on our  instructions variable. Here's what we do: $ 'instructions' .set 'html', instructions ;  This is what our page looks like in Windows:  [ 88 ]                                                                        8.   If userPlatform is not other or ipod, we want to get rid of the unordered list  with the class of download-options, since we don't need it anymore. We will use  the .destroy   method which removes selected objects from the DOM. We'll also  use a control structure to check whether or not userPlatform isn't other or ipod  so that we still display the download options if we can't detect the operating system. We'll select download-options and run the destroy method on it, just like so:  Chapter 4  if userPlatform!='other'  userPlatform!='ipod'   {   }  $$ '.download-options' .destroy  ;  Just like magic, our unordered list is gone.  9.  We should now present the user with their download option. We'll create   a new div element  just like in Chapter 2  and give it some styles.             New div element          var downloadBox = new Element 'div', {             'styles' : {                'border': '2px solid 555555',                'padding' : 10,                'background-color' : 'a0c1e9'             }          } ;  [ 89 ]                                                                        The Core's Useful Utility Functions  10.  We should customize the content of downloadBox with the downloadURL value.   We'll set its HTML property like so: 'html' : 'Download location:  '+    downloadURL+'  '  11.  Next, we inject the downloadBox element right after the instructions   paragraph using the .inject   method. downloadBox.inject $ 'instructions' , 'after' ;  12.  Lastly, we need to call our pageCustomizer   function:  pageCustomizer userPlatform ;  We're done! We just supercharged an ordinary download page into a tailored web page   that acts according to what the user's operating system is. Let's pull the entire script in one  big go:    window.addEvent 'domready', function   {    var userPlatform = Browser.Platform.name;   Customizes download page depending on client's platform    var pageCustomizer = function  platform  {       var platformNameFull = '';       var instructions = '';       var downloadFilePath = '';    Control stucture       if platform == 'win'  {          platformNameFull = ' for Windows XP Vista';          instructions = 'We recommend installing SuperSoftware in                            C:\\Program Files';          downloadURL = 'win.zip';       } else if platform == 'mac'  {          platformNameFull = 'for Mac OS X';          instructions = ' Mac OS X users should be aware of a minor              bug in SuperSoftware.

We explored the Browser.Platform property provided to us by MooTools by way of an  example scenario—SuperSoftware's download page. We customize the page depending   on what the user's operating system was. More specifically, this is what we did together:     Determined the user's operating system using Browser.Platform.name   Constructed a function called pageCustomizer  , that contains a control structure    if else statements  to assign three local variables  platformNameFull,  Instructions, downloadFilePath  appropriate values depending on the client's  platform name    Got rid of the unordered list using the .dispose   method  if the platform name     Created a new element called downloadBox, that we injected into the DOM using   was either win, linux, or mac   the .inject   method  You learned a lot in this section, so let's cap it off with a little pop quiz.  Pop quiz – finding out information about the client's operating system If a user uses an Apple iPhone to navigate to SuperDownload page, which of the following  choices would return true?  1.  Browser.Platform.mac 2.  Browser.Platform.iPhone 3.  Browser.Platform.other 4.  Browser.Platform.ipod  Exploring the Core utility functions  Now that we've investigated the Browser component of MooTools, let's check out the  Core component.  The Core component contains a plethora of useful functions  15 of them to be exact   that many JavaScript developers believe should have been in native JavaScript. You'll find  functions that will check if an object is defined, functions that work with date and time, and  a hodgepodge of miscellaneous functions that will save you a lot of code-writing.  Let's delve into the Core by exploring all of its functions.  [ 92 ]                                                                        Chapter 4  Checking to see if objects are defined You can often run into trouble when an object you're trying to access in your script is  null or undefined. Because JavaScript allows you to create empty objects and create them  on-the-fly without declaring them first, you'll often need to check if an object you're trying   to use contains something.  This leads to a lot of if else statements and try catch methods. Let MooTools do all the  hard work by leveraging some of the useful utility functions it makes available to us, namely:  $chk, $defined, $pick, $try.  Seeing if an object has a value with $chk You can use the $chk function to see if an object is a true value or if it's false. This is  especially useful for ascertaining that an object contains something.  In the above example, the alert box will display the second condition Object does not have  a value because even though we declared myObject, we didn't assign it a value.  For example:  window.addEvent 'domready', function   {    var myObject;    if $chk myObject   {       alert 'Object has a value' ;    } else {       alert 'Object does not have a value' ;    } } ;  Compare it with the following code block:  window.addEvent 'domready', function   {    var myObject;    myObject = 0;    if myObject  {       alert 'Object exists' ;    } else {       alert 'Object does not exist' ;    } } ;  We've assigned a value to myObject, but it will still alert us that the object does not exist.  It's because JavaScript uses a falsy truthy system where "0" is considered "false" and "1" is  considered "true".  [ 93 ]                                                                        The Core's Useful Utility Functions  If you need myObject to evaluate true even when it's given a value of 0  or vice versa, you  want it to evaluate false when it's given a value of 1 , then you should use $chk  .  $chk also checks to see if the value is not '', which is used to initiate variables that will hold  string literals, such as:  var myString = '';  In the following example, we'll be alerted that the object does not exist because it doesn't  contain a value:  Checking if an object is defined with $defined $defined is very similar to $chk but it only evaluates whether an object is defined or not.  window.addEvent 'domready', function   {    var myObject;    myObject = '';    if $chk myObject   {       alert 'Object exists' ;    } else {       alert 'Object does not exist' ;    } } ;  For example:  window.addEvent 'domready', function   {    var myObject;    if $defined myObject   {       alert 'Object is defined' ;    } else {       alert 'Object is not defined' ;    } } ;  Will alert us that the Object is not defined because we haven't assigned it a value.  [ 94 ]                                                                        Comparing it to $chk, the following block is considered as defined  evaluates true  even if  the string literally contains nothing.  Chapter 4  window.addEvent 'domready', function   {    var myObject;    myObject = '';    if $defined myObject   {       alert 'Object is defined' ;    } else {       alert 'Object is not defined' ;    } } ;  Selecting the first defined object using $pick $pick allows you to pass several objects into it, and it will select the first object that  is defined.  In the following example, definedFruit will be assigned the value of oranges have  vitamin C because it is the first object passed into $pick that is defined.  window.addEvent 'domready', function   {    var apples;    var oranges = 'oranges have vitamin C';    var grapes = 'grapes are purple';     var definedFruit = $pick apples, oranges, grapes ; } ;  Getting the return of first working function with $try $try accepts multiple functions, and it will attempt to execute each one. It will return the  first function that does not fail without executing consecutive functions. $try is really useful  because this avoids having to write several try catch blocks that "try" whether some code  will fail or work properly.  Here's an example that sets the value of myObject to This is my String. It's mine.:  window.addEvent 'domready', function   {    var myObject = $try     function myFailedFunction   {       myCounter++;         myCounter is not defined so it skips it       return myCounter;    },    function myWorkingFunction   {  [ 95 ]                                                                        The Core's Useful Utility Functions        var myString="This is my string. It's mine.";       return myString;    } ;    alert myObject ; } ;  Dealing with time and intervals The core utility functions include two awesome functions that deal with time and intervals:  $time   and $clear  .  The $time   function The $time   function simply returns the current system time of the client, in the number  of milliseconds that's elapsed since January 01, 1970.  Instead of figuring dates  which can be hard with leap years and such , the function can be  used to determine how fast or slow certain processes are.  Let's explore a simple example, seeing how fast you can click on a button.  Time for action – the $time   function We're going to see how fast  or slow  you click a button:  1.  First, we'll grab the start time and place it in an object called startTime. Right   below it, we'll call the alert function to print out a message soliciting the user to  click on the OK button. Right after that, we'll get the ending time and place  it into an object called endTime.    var startTime = $time  ;    alert 'Click on the OK button.' ;  [ 96 ]                                                                        Chapter 4        The $time   function will be called again as soon as the  user presses 'OK' to get the endTime. var endTime = $time  ;  2.  Next, we need to calculate the difference between endTime and startTime. Let's  place that value inside an object called totalTime. var startTime = $time  ; alert 'Click on the OK button.' ;    The $time   function will be called again as soon as the user     presses "OK" to get the endTime. var endTime = $time  ; var totalTime = endTime - startTime;  3.  Finally, we want to print out the results. We'll use the .write   JavaScript method   to write the results into our document. We'll print out the time in milliseconds,  and also the time in seconds for readability  we just divide totalTime by 1000 . document.write 'It took '+totalTime+' milliseconds  or  '+totalTime 1000+' seconds  for you to click the OK button.' ;  4.  Open the HTML in your web browser. The first thing you'll see should be the alert   dialog box, asking you to click on the OK button.   [ 97 ]                                                                        The Core's Useful Utility Functions  Once you click on the OK button of the dialog box, you'll see the total time it took for you to  click the OK button  in units of milliseconds and seconds .  What just happened? You discovered a way to use the $time   function to monitor the time it takes in between  two processes. This has many uses, including profiling your scripts to see how long certain  tasks take to execute. If you find a really slow function, it's time to rewrite  called refactor  it!  The $clear   function The $clear   function simply removes delays and timeouts you may have set. It's often  used with the .delay   method  which delays an execution of a function by the time, in  milliseconds, that you pass to it  and the periodical   function, which executes a function  in set intervals.  Let's explore the $clear   function with an example. We'll execute a function that  transitions a blue box  a div element  to the right repeatedly using the periodical    function, then stop it from executing any further after the third execution.  Here's the HTML structure we'll be using  there's nothing fancy about it :  To make our blue box easier to see, you can use this CSS style rule:        I'm Blue.     bluebox {             }  width:100px; height:100px; background-color:00f; border:1px solid 006; text-align:center; color:fff;  [ 98 ]                                                                        With everything set up, this is what you should see when previewing your HTML document.  Chapter 4  Let's look at making this box move using MooTools.  Time for action – exploring the $clear   function with  periodical   To showcase the use of $clear  , we'll use one of its complimentary functions,  periodical  . We'll create a function that will transition bluebox to the left in  increments of 50 pixels, five times. Then we're going to stop executing the function   further  or else it will keep moving to the left infinitely .  1.  First, we'll create an integer object that will hold the number of times our function   has executed.    var counter = 0;  2.  Next, let's create our function, we'll called it moveLeft  .     var moveLeft = function   {          our function code goes here.     }  3.   Inside moveLeft, we'll write use the tween   method to move bluebox to the left. $ 'bluebox' .tween 'margin-left',  counter+1 *50 ;  4.  Now, we need to increment the counter every time the function is called. We'll use   the following line of code, which will execute as soon as our box has finished   the animation to the left: counter++;  [ 99 ]                                                                        The Core's Useful Utility Functions  5.  Let's now use periodical   to execute the moveLeft   at intervals  of 1 second  or 1000 milliseconds . var moving = moveLeft.periodical 1000 ;  6.  The problem with this is that it will keep on moving to the left. So we'll have   to stop moving.  7.   Inside the moveLeft function, we'll add an if conditional statement that checks  whether the counter is equal to 5 or not. If it's equal to 5, then we know our   function has been called five times, and therefore it's time to use $clear    on our periodical   function  which we call moving . Add the following if  statement inside the moveLeft   function:       if counter == 5  {          $clear moving ;       }  8.  We're done! Our bluebox should now move left five times in set intervals of  1 second. Then when it's moved 5 times, it will stop moving. Here's the final   script that we wrote together:  window.addEvent 'domready', function   {                   } ;  var counter = 0; var moveLeft = function   {           } var moving = moveLeft.periodical 1000 ;  $ 'bluebox' .tween 'margin-left',  counter+1 *50 ; counter++; if counter == 5  {   }  $clear moving ;  [ 100 ]                                                                        Chapter 4  What just happened? We explored one of the ways to use the $clear function, stopping clearing periodical after  a certain amount of time.  Besides that, you got a chance to discover another handy MooTools function—the  periodical   function, which is helpful when you want to execute another function  at set intervals.  Utility functions for working with objects There are several utility functions that will come in handy for working with objects and  saving a few more lines of code. Namely, they are:    $extend     $merge     $each    Extending objects with $extend   $extends   accepts two arguments: the first one is the target object that will be extended,  and the second argument is the object whose properties will be copied to the target object.  Here's an example script that uses the $extend function to extend the first object  called  firstObject :  window.addEvent 'domready', function   {      firstObject object    var firstObject = {       'color' : 'blue',       'length' : 50    };      secondObject object    var secondObject = {       'width' : 100,       'depth' : 200    }    $extend firstObject, secondObject ;    alert 'firstObjects width is ' + firstObject.width ; } ;  [ 101 ]                                                                        The Core's Useful Utility Functions  Even though we didn't declare a 'width' index for firstObject, you can see that it took on  the value of 'width' from secondObject.  Merging objects with $merge   $merge works similarly to $extend, but it can take more than two objects as arguments and  "deep-copies" objects, which means objects within objects will also be merged. If there is a  conflict in properties  two objects have the same property , then the last object supplied into  the $merge   function takes precedence.  In the following example, three arrays are merged into an array called combinedObject.  Then we use the .write   method on our document to print out the values of  inside combinedObject.  window.addEvent 'domready', function   {      firstObject array    var firstObject = {       'color' : 'blue',       'length' : 50    };      secondObject array    var secondObject = {       'width' : 100,       'depth' : 200    }    var thirdObject = {       'width' : 300,       'height' : 100    }    var combinedObject = $merge firstObject, secondObject,                                   thirdObject ;  [ 102 ]                                                                        Chapter 4     document.write 'color: '+ combinedObject.color + " " ;       This should be 300 because thirdObject comes later than        secondObject    document.write 'width: '+ combinedObject.width + " " ;    document.write 'depth: '+ combinedObject.depth + " " ;    document.write 'height: '+ combinedObject.height + " " ; } ;  Iterating through objects using $each $each is a helpful function to save you some time in having to write loops  like for, while,  and so on . It takes two arguments: an object or array to be iterated upon, and the function  to run on each item inside the object. The basic format of an $each function call is:  $each targetObject, function  {} ;  The second argument, the function to run, can take in three arguments: the current item  or  value , the index  or key , and the object that's being iterated upon. You can then use these  arguments as references inside the function. The basic format of the function   argument  for $each is:  function currentItem, indexOrKey, targetObject   Let's examine the $each   function in action. Let's say we have an object that contains the  cars I'll be buying with the massive profits I make from the sales of this book  thank you by  the way, I'll be thinking of you as I cruise around town with one of these bad boys :     var myCars = {       'Ferrari 612 Scaglietti' : 'first',       'Bugatti EB 16.4 Veyron' : 'second',       'Masarati Quattroporte' : 'third'    }  Let's write a script that uses $each to print out my cars.  [ 103 ]                                                                        The Core's Useful Utility Functions  Time for action – exploring the $each function Let's see how the $each function helps us to list down our dream cars:  1.  Let's set up the structure of the $each function. As our target object, we pass the   argument of myCars. priority a the current item value, and car the current  object's key.    $each myCars, function priority, car {          Code to print out each car goes here.    } ;  2.  We'll use the .write   method to display the contents of myCars.     $each myCars, function priority, car {       document.write ' Priority:  '+priority+',            Car name:  '+car+' ' ;    } ;  3.  Preview the script in your browser, and voila, you've got a list of my dream cars.  What just happened? We explored a quicker way of iterating through objects using the $each function. $each  can be used on any objects that are iterable, including arrays and class objects. The $each  function saves you time in having to write complex, nested for and while loops.  [ 104 ]                                                                        Other utility functions in the Core Here are hodgepodges of miscellaneous functions that are included in the Core.  Generating a random number with $random $random is a helpful function and a shortcut for executing a numerical value between  two ranges.  Chapter 4  The basic format is:  $random minValue, maxValue   Using $random in the following way will assign myDiceRoll a numerical value between 1  and 6.  var myDiceRoll = $random 1,6 ;  Converting objects to arrays with $splat $splat will take one argument and convert it into an array, if it isn't already one and if  it's defined.  In the following example, $splat will create an empty array with a single value  called newArray.  $splat ' newArray ' ;  If we pass an array as an argument, $splat won't do anything to it. In the following  example, the alert dialog box will display 1, because we passed an array into $splat.   var myArray = $splat [1,2,3] ; alert myArray[0] ;  Determining the data type using $type JavaScript is a liberal and lenient language. It doesn't require you to declare a data type  before creating an object, and you can switch data types at any time.   $type allows you to check what your object's data type is. In the following example,  switchy is an integer first, then changed to a string literal datatype, and lastly changed to a  Boolean  true or false .  window.addEvent 'domready', function   {       First it's Number    switchy = 0;    alert $type switchy  ;       Switcheroo, now it's a String  [ 105 ]                                                                        The Core's Useful Utility Functions     switchy = '';    alert $type switchy  ;       Another Switcheroo, now it's a Boolean    switchy = true;    alert $type switchy  ; } ;  Typically, in other languages, assigning a variable that's previously declared as a certain data  type will issue an error and break your scripts. With JavaScript, it'll just go along with it and  convert your variable's data type to the appropriate one. This is convenient when you're fully  aware of the conversion happening, but if you're not, this can lead to logical errors which are  very hard to catch since they may not break your scripts or alert you to an error. $type will  check to make sure your variable is the data type that you need it to be.  Limited use functions Here are a few functions that are included in the Core, but have a very limited and specific  use. These functions are typically used for MooTools' internal functions  but are readily  available to you anyway .  Creating a function placeholder with $empty $empty simply creates an empty function. You typically use this inside class and events  functions to avoid logical errors in your scripts while developing.  To create an empty function, simply write:  var myPlaceholderFunction = $empty;  Returning arguments using $lambda $lambda just returns the value you pass to it. In the following example, $lambda just  assigns myObject a value of false.  $myObject = $lambda false ;  $lambda is very obscure and is of limited use, so don't expect to be using it too much. Creating a function that returns the specified value using $arguments $arguments creates a function that returns the argument that you point to. In the following  example, $mySimpleFunction will return a value of banana because $arguments points  to the second argument of mySimpleFunction.  mySimpleFunction = $arguments 1 ; alert mySimpleFunction 'apple', banana', 'grapes'  ;  [ 106 ]                                                                        Chapter 4  Summary  Specifically, we:  In this chapter, we covered the Core component of MooTools, which is split up into two   sub-components: Core->Browser and Core->Core.    Learned how to obtain information about the client using browser properties, such   as what browser they're using and what operating system they're using    Explored the Core->Core's useful  and not so useful  helper utility functions  Now that we've learned about the Core component, we're ready to animate objects in the  DOM, which is the topic of the next chapter.  [ 107 ]                                                                                                                                              5  Working with Events  In this chapter, we'll be exploring browser events. We'll also see how MooTools  can help us watch out for events such as mouse clicks, mouse movements,  keyboard presses, and all the events that make our web pages more responsive  to user actions.  In this chapter, we shall:    Define what events are in web development terms   Learn how to add event listeners to web page elements   Find out how to create custom events to extend MooTools' event object   Learn how to remove, clone, and fire off events   Investigate MooTools events methods and properties  We have a lot of things to cover in this chapter, so hold on to your seats and enjoy the ride!  What are events exactly?  Events are simply things that happen in our web pages. MooTools supports all HTML 4.01  event attributes like onclick and onmouseout, but the framework refers to them without  the "on" prefix  click instead of onclick, mouseout instead of onmouseout .  What's neat about MooTools is that it not only extends HTML 4.01 event attributes with a  few of its own, but also ensures that methods and functions that deal with web page events  work across all web browsers by providing us with a solid, built-in object called events. Event  is part of the native component of MooTools, and is also referred to as the "event hash".                                                                        Working with Events  You can read the official W3C specifications on events in the  HTML 4.01 Specification, section 18.2.3, under Intrinsic  events: http:  www.w3.org TR html401  interact scripts.htmlh-18.2.3  We'll go over all of the available event attributes in MooTools so that you can learn what  stuff we can listen to. There are several events that we can detect or "listen to". We can, for  the sake of discussion, divide them into five groups: window events, form events, keyboard  events, mouse events, and MooTools custom events.  Window events Window events refer to activities that occur in the background. There are only two  window events.  HTML event attribute   MooTools event name What is it? onload   load  This event occurs when the window and images  on the page have fully loaded, and or when all of  the iFrames in the page have loaded. It can be  used for monitoring when the web page has fully  loaded  such as when you want to know if all  images have been downloaded . This even happens when a window or an  iFrame is removed from the web page. It has  limited use.  onunload   unload  Form events There are events that occur within form elements  such as   elements , and we'll  refer to these as form events.  For example, the onfocus event is triggered when the user clicks on an input field  you'll  see this in action in this chapter , effectively focusing on that particular input field. Some of  these events apply even to non-form elements.  [ 110 ]                                                                        HTML event attribute   MooTools event name What is it? onblur   blur  onchange   change  onfocus   focus  onreset   reset  onselect   select  onsubmit   submit  Chapter 5  This event occurs when an element loses focus,  either because the user has clicked out of it,  or because the user used the Tab key to move  away from it. This is helpful for monitoring the  instant when the user loses focus on a particular  element. This event happens when the element loses focus  or when its original value has changed. This is  helpful for knowing when the user starts typing  in the input text field or text area, or when a user  selects different option in a select drop-down  element. This event is the opposite of the blur event;  it is triggered when the user focuses on an  element. This is useful for watching when the  user highlights a form field or when they have  navigated to it using the Tab key. This event only applies to form elements. This  event is triggered when the form has been reset  to its default values. This event happens when the user highlights   selects  text in a text field. This event is only for form elements. This event  occurs when the user submits a web form.  Keyboard events There are events that happen when a user presses on a keyboard input device; let's call  these the keyboard events.  For example, the onkeypress event is triggered when you press any key on your keyboard.  HTML event attribute   MooTools event name What is it? onkeydown   keydown  onkeypress   keypress  onkeyup   keyup  This event occurs when the user holds down a  keyboard key. This event is triggered whenever the user  presses a keyboard key. This event happens when the user releases a  key.  [ 111 ]                                                                        Working with Events  Mouse events There are several HTML event properties that allow you to deal with activities related to the  mouse. Clicking, moving, double-clicking, and hovering are all mouse events.  HTML event attribute   MooTools event name What is it? onclick   click  MooTools custom mouse events MooTools supplies us with three custom events that extend the standard mouse events.  ondblclick   dblclick  onmousedown   mousedown  onmouseup   mouseup  onmousemove   mousemove onmouseout   mouseout  onmouseover   mouseover  MooTools event name mouseenter  mouseleave  mousewheel  This event occurs whenever the user uses  the mouse button to click on an element. This event occurs whenever the user  double-clicks on an element. This event occurs when the mouse button is held  down. This event occurs when the mouse button is  released. This event occurs when the mouse is moved. This event occurs when the mouse pointer is  removed from the target element. This event occurs when the mouse pointer enters  the target element.  What is it? This event is triggered when the user's mouse pointer  enters an element, but does not fire again when the  mouse goes over a child element  unlike mouseover .  This is useful for detecting the mouseover event once  in nested element structures, such as   item<  a> . If we were to use the mouseover event, it  would be triggered twice, once for   and once again  for  . This event works similarly to mouseenter in that it is  triggered only once when the mouse pointer exits the  target element, unlike the mouseout event that gets  triggered more than once for nested element structures. This even is triggered when the scroller on a mouse  is used  available in most modern mouse input devices,  usually situated in between the left and   right buttons .  [ 112 ]                                                                        Chapter 5  Adding event listeners  We can attach event listeners to elements on a web page using the addEvent and  addEvents methods. By doing so, we're able to find out whenever that event happens,  as well as execute a function to react to them.  Adding event listeners is the basis for interactivity, and is where JavaScript and   subsequently  MooTools has gained its popularity. Imagine being able to perform an  operation whenever a user hovers over an image, or clicks on a link, or whenever the user  submits a form; the possibilities are endless.  Adding a single event listener The addEvent method allows you to add one event listener to an element method, and  follows the format:  $ yourelement .addEvent event, function  {}   For example, in the following code block, we attach a click event listener for all    elements. When the user clicks on any hyperlink on our web page, it runs a function that  opens up an alert dialog box that says, You clicked on a hyperlink.     $$ 'a' .addEvent 'click', function  {       alert 'You clicked on a hyperlink' ;    } ;  In a moment, we'll create a simple web form highlighting the input field that the user is  focused on.  Time for action – highlighting focused fields of web forms Let's start with our web form's HTML.   1.  We'll use   and   tags that will hold our user's   information as well as provide them a means to submit the web form   input type="button" . We use the   tag to indicate  to the user what information to put inside each form field.        Name:                 Email:             [ 113 ]                                                                        Working with Events       Comment:                       With the above markup, this is how our form looks:  2.  Our web form is a bit dull, so how about we spruce it up a bit  with some CSS? Read the comments to gain insight on some of  the more important CSS properties to take a note off.  * Center the fields using text-align:center *  form {    width:300px;    border:1px solid b1b8c2;    background-color:e3e9f2;    text-align:center;    padding:25px 0; } label {    display:block;    font:12px normal Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; }  * Give  the input and textarea fields a 1px border *  input, textarea {    width:250px;    border:1px solid 5c616a;  [ 114 ]                                                                        Chapter 5  } textarea {    height:100px; } p {    text-align:left;    display:block;    width:250px;    overflow:auto;    padding:0;    margin:5px 0; }  * We will give fields that are currently focused on the .focus  class which will give them a distinct thicker border and  background color compared to the other input fields *   .focused {    border:3px solid b1b8c2;    background-color: e8e3e3; }  With just a few styles, our simple web form has transformed to a more attractive  form field.  [ 115 ]                                                                        Working with Events  3.  Let us move onto the JavaScript. We use the addEvent method to add an event  listener for the form event, onfocus. When the user focuses on a particular field,  we run a function that adds the .focus CSS class on that field which we declared  as a style rule in step 2. We'll also remove .focus class on other fields on the  web page. window.addEvent 'domready', function  {   var els = $$ 'input, textarea'    els.addEvent 'focus', function  {    els.removeClass 'focused' ;    this.addClass 'focused' ;   }  } ;  Now, when you focus on a form field, it will be highlighted with a thick blue border and with  a lighter blue background. Users who use the Tab key to navigate in between form fields will  appreciate this feature since they'll clearly see which field is active.  [ 116 ]                                                                        Chapter 5  What just happened? In the previous example, we created a simple and interactive web form that highlights the  current field  the user has active . We did this by using the addEvent method, adding an  event listener for the focus form event. When the user focuses on a particular input field,  we executed a function that adds the .focus CSS class, which highlights the focused field    or   with a thick blue border with a light blue background.  By highlighting active fields in a web form, we have just improved our form's usability by  providing visual feedback about which field the user is currently on.  Adding multiple event listeners The addEvents method allows you to add more than one event listener to an element   or set of elements . This is the format for running the addEvents method on an element.  $ yourelement .addEvents {    'event1' : function {}, 'event2' : function {} }   Let's explore the addEvents method using the previous web form example.  Time for action – adding tooltips to the web form We'll use the same web form as before, but we'll modify it to provide a hover over tooltip  for users. This can be used to provide more explanation for a particular field. Although the  example we're using is pretty straightforward, there are some web forms that have labels  that could use a little tooltip help to clarify to the users what they need to enter.  1.  First, we have to modify our HTML. We'll add   tags with the text  ? , which   when the user hovers over them, will display a relevant tooltip information box   beside our web form. We give each of these span tags a unique ID so that we   can tell MooTools which help text to display. The tooltip information box is a   div with the ID of feedback.       Name:   ?               Email:   ?                   Comment: <span class="help"      id="hComment"> ?   <textarea name="Comment"      cols="" rows="">           [ 117 ]                                                                        Working with Events       &nbsp;   2.  Let's give our new elements some CSS styles.  feedback {    width:200px;    border:1px solid f90;    background-color:ffc;    padding:5px;    font:bold 12px Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;     * Displays the div to the right of our web form *     position:absolute;    top:15px;    left:315px; } .help {    color:009;    font:bold 12px Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;  * Changes mouse cursor to pointer when mouse hovers on .help *     cursor:pointer; }  3.   It's time for some MooTools code. First, we should hide the feedback div.   $ 'feedback' .setStyle 'opacity', 0 ;  4.  Let's create an array object called helptext that will hold our help text  which we will display. For the index, we use the ID of the .help span tag  for each input field, so that we easily reference the array position later on.       Initialize helptext array, will store help text    var helptext = {};        Put help text inside array    Helptext.hName = 'Enter your first and last name';    Helptext.hEmail = 'Enter a valid email address';    Helptext.hComment = 'Leave your feedback';  [ 118 ]                                                                        5.  Next we'll add two event listeners using the .addEvents   method. The first event   listener is for mouseover: when the user puts their mouse cursor over a .help  span element, we show tween the feedback div in, and give it the associated text.    'mouseover' : function   {  Chapter 5           Get the span's ID       var spanID = $ this .get 'id' ;           Set the text inside feedback div, reference          array index using spanID       $ 'feedback' .set 'html', helptext[spanID] ;  $ 'feedback' .tween 'opacity', 1 ;     }  6.  The second event listener that we add to our span elements is mouseout; when the   user removes their mouse cursor from a span tag, it will hide the feedback div.    'mouseout' : function   {       $ 'feedback' .tween 'opacity', 0 ;    }  7.  Our addEvent   code block now looks like this:    $$ '.help' .addEvents {    'mouseover' : function   {       $ 'feedback' .tween 'opacity', 1 ;          Get the span's ID       spanID = $ this .get 'id' ;          Set the text inside feedback div, reference          array index using spanID       $ 'feedback' .set 'html', helptext[spanID] ;    },    'mouseout' : function   {       $ 'feedback' .tween 'opacity', 0 ;    }   } ;  [ 119 ]                                                                        Working with Events  Our form should now look like this:  8.  Here is the entire MooTools script:  window.addEvent 'domready', function  {   $ 'feedback' .setStyle 'opacity', 0 ;   $$ 'input, textarea' .addEvent 'focus', function  {       $$ 'input, textarea' .removeClass 'focused' ;       $ this .addClass 'focused' ;   } ;       Initialize helptext array, will store help text    var helptext = [];       Put help text inside array    helptext['hName'] = 'Enter your first and last name';    helptext['hEmail'] = 'Enter a valid email address';    helptext['hComment'] = 'Leave your feedback';      Add events to span.help   $$ '.help' .addEvents {    'mouseover' : function   {       $ 'feedback' .tween 'opacity', 1 ;          Get the span's ID       spanID = $ this .get 'id' ;  [ 120 ]                                                                        Chapter 5           Set the text inside feedback div, reference          array index using spanID       $ 'feedback' .set 'html', helptext[spanID] ;    },    'mouseout' : function   {       $ 'feedback' .tween 'opacity', 0 ;    }   } ; } ;  9.  When you hover over a  ? , you should see something similar to the following image:  What just happened? In the previous example, we discovered how to add more than one event listener to an  element using the .addEvents   method.  [ 121 ]                                                                        Working with Events  Creating custom events  Besides the standard HTML events that you saw earlier in this chapter, you can also create  custom events of your own. For example, you may want to create a custom event for a  user pressing the Caps Lock key; you can do this by adding  extending  properties to the  Element.Events object in MooTools. Here is the format for adding event properties to  the Element.Events MooTools object:  Element.Events.eventname = {    'base' : 'click',    A base event such as click, keypress,       keydown, onload, etc.     'condition' : function   {          conditions that need to be met to trigger event    },    'onAdd' : function   {          Functions to trigger when you bind add the event to elements    },    'onRemove' : function   {          Functions to execute when you unbind remove elements    } };  There are five things to take a note off in the above code sample.    eventname: This is the name of your custom event.   base: This is an optional string value which gives our custom event a standard event   to listen to. If you have condition set, which is also an optional property, then you  must also have base set.    condition: This is a function that must be met to trigger the event; in other words,  the function must return a boolean value of true in order for the event to fire. This  is an optional property to set, but if you have condition set, you must also have  base set.    onAdd: This is an optional function property; it fires off the function that you assign   to it whenever the custom event is added or bound to elements.    onRemove: This is an optional function property, and it does the opposite of   onAdd; if the custom event is removed or un-bound from elements, then it will  trigger the function.  There's really no better way to learn about creating custom events than by creating one.  That's what we'll do next!  [ 122 ]                                                                        Time for action – creating a custom event for showing help tips Imagine that you created a web application that supports keyboard shortcuts. Keyboard  shortcuts allow users to use web applications more efficiently. For this example, let us say  that one of your keyboard shortcuts is Shft + H, which displays a box with help tips in it.  Chapter 5  1.  First step, let's set up the HTML for our help tip box. Our help tip box will be a     with an ID of help.       myWebApp      Use  Shift + H  to view Help tips on how to         use this web application.              Help Tips         This is the help tip box. It will display helpful tips on            how to use this web application.         Press  Shift + H  on the keyboard to            toggle this box.          2.  Let's give the help tip box some styles, as well as change the default font style of   the HTML web page with some CSS. Let us give the help tip box a gray background  with a dotted border to make it easy to distinguish. This step is optional. body {    font:12px solid Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; } help {    width:200px;    background:ccc;    padding:5px;    border: 1px dotted 00f; }  3.   It's time for MooTools to step in. The first thing we'll do is hide the help tip box. We'll  do this using the .setStyle   MooTools method, setting the opacity property to 0. $ 'help’ .setStyle 'opacity', 0 ;  [ 123 ]                                                                        Working with Events  4.  Next, we'll create our custom event. This custom event will be called shiftH. We'll   use the base event keypress so that whenever you press something on the  keyboard, the event will check to see if the appropriate keys are pressed    Shift and H keys at the same time .       Add custom event to MooTools Events object    Element.Events.shiftH = {           Set our base event to 'keypress'       base: 'keypress'    };  5.  We should set the condition for this custom event. We want this event to be   triggered whenever we have pressed Shift and H keys at the same time. We can  use the MooTools event property called .shift, which returns a boolean value of  true when the Shift key is pressed. We will also use the .key event property, which returns a string that has the value  of the key that was pressed in lowercase. In our instance the .key property should  be equal to 'h'.  Both Shift and H keys must be pressed at the same time. In other words, our  custom event  shiftH  will not be triggered when you press the H key without  also pressing the Shift key  and vice versa . Therefore, the condition will return  the true value only when customEvent.shift is true and customEvent. key=='h' is true.        Add custom event to MooTools Events object    Element.Events.shiftH = {           Set our base event to 'keypress'       base: 'keypress',          Condition that must be met        condition: function customEvent {            if customEvent.shift && customEvent.key=='h' { return true;          else{             return false; }        }    };  6.  The only thing that is left is adding an event listener for shiftH. We'll use the   addEvent method, that will run a function that toggles the help div.       Add custom event on document object    window.addEvent 'shiftH', function  {          execute the stuff in here    } ;  [ 124 ]                                                                        Chapter 5  7.  The code we want to execute when the shiftH event is triggered is showing the  help div when it's hidden, and vice versa; in other words, we want to toggle the  opacity of help div. We'll transition the opacity using the .tween   method. We'll create a variable for the opacity value we want to assign to the help div;  opacityValue. If the current opacity is 0, then opacityValue will be 1. If the  current opacity is 1, then opacityValue will be 0. Then, we tween the help div  opacity property to opacityValue.           If opacity is 0 then we tween to 1, and vice versa       var opacityValue =  $ 'help' .get 'opacity'   == 0 ? 1 : 0;       $ 'help' .tween 'opacity', opacityValue ;  8.  All together, our MooTools script looks like:  window.addEvent 'domready', function  {    $ 'help' .setStyle 'opacity', 0 ;       Add custom event to MooTools Events object    Element.Events.shiftH = {           Set our base event to 'keypress'       base: 'keypress',          Event condition        condition: function customEvent {         if customEvent.shift && customEvent.key=='h'  return true;        }    };       Add custom event on document object    window.addEvent 'shiftH', function e {          If opacity is 0 then we tween to 1, and vice versa       var opacityValue =  $ 'help' .get 'opacity'   == 0 ? 1 : 0;       $ 'help' .tween 'opacity', opacityValue ;    } ; } ;  [ 125 ]                                                                        Working with Events  9.  Test your web page in your favorite web browser. Then toggle the help tip box   by pressing Ctrl + H keys.  What just happened? You've discovered how to create a custom event by extending the MooTools event object.  We created a custom event called shiftH which had a base event of keypress. The  condition that must be met for shiftH to be triggered is that both the Shift key and  the H key are pressed at the same time.  Additionally, we were able to explore two MooTools methods included inside events:  .shift which returns true if the Shift key is pressed, and .key which returns a  lowercase string value of the key that is pressed.  [ 126 ]                                                                        Chapter 5  Have a go hero – create your own custom event Why don't you try to create your own custom event? How about modifying shiftH to  ctrlH, and so that help div is toggled when your users press Ctrl + H keys.  You can see what other event methods are available to you in the official MooTools  documentation: http:  mootools.net docs core Native EventEvent. In this  instance, you'll have to replace the .shift event method to .control event method.  Removing, cloning, and firing off events  Besides adding event listeners, other operations you may want to do are removing events  from an element, cloning events from other elements, and firing off events for elements  manually. We'll go through each one of these operations.  Removing events from elements There are instances when you want to remove an event listener that you've added to an  element. One reason would be that you only want an element to be triggered once, and  after that event has been triggered, you no longer want to trigger it again. To ensure it only  fires once, you should remove the event once certain conditions have been met.  Removing a single event from elements There are two methods available to you for removing events from elements. The first is  removeEvent  , which removes a single specified event.  Time for action – removing an event Let's say you have some hyperlinks on a page, which when clicked, will alert the user that  they have clicked a hyperlink, but you only want to do it once. To ensure that the warning  message appears only once, we'll have to remove the event after it has been fired.  This type of thing may be utilized for instructional tips: when the user sees an unfamiliar  interface element, you can display a help tip for them, but only once, because you don't  want the tip to keep showing up every single time they perform an action.  1.  First, let's put some links on a web page.   Hyperlink 1   Hyperlink 2   [ 127 ]                                                                        Working with Events  2.	 Next, let's create a function object which we will call whenever a click event   happens   on any of the links on our page. When the function fires, it will open up an alert   box with a message, and then it will remove the click event from all   elements  on the web page.    Create an function object var warning = function   {    alert 'You have clicked a link. This is your only warning' ;       After warning has executed, remove it     $$ 'a' .removeEvent 'click', warning ; };  3.	 Now we add a click event listener that will fire off the warning function object.     Add a click event listener which when triggered, executes the    warning function $$ 'a' .addEvent 'click', warning ;  4.	 Our script should look like the following:  window.addEvent 'domready', function  {        Create an function object that will be executed when a         click happens    var warning = function   {       alert 'You have clicked a link. This is your only warning' ;          After warning has executed, remove it from all             elements on the web page       $$ 'a' .removeEvent 'click', warning ;    };        Add a click event listener which when triggered, executes        the warning function    $$ 'a' .addEvent 'click', warning ; } ;  5.	 Test in your web browser by clicking on any of the hyperlinks on the page. The first  time you click, you'll see an alert dialog box with our message. The second  or third,   fourth, fifth, you get the picture  time you click on any hyperlink, the alert   dialog box will no longer show up.  [ 128 ]                                                                        Chapter 5  Removing a type of event, or all events, from elements If you want to remove a type of event on an element  or set of elements , or if you  want to remove all events regardless of their type from an element, you have to use   the removeEvents method.  To remove a type of event from an element, you pass the type of event you want to remove  as a parameter of the removeEvents method. For example, if you wanted to remove all  click events that were added using the MooTools addEvent method from an element called  myElement, you would do the following:  $ 'myElement' .removeEvents 'click' ;  [ 129 ]                                                                        Working with Events  If instead, you wanted to remove all events that myElement has, regardless of the type of  event it has, then you would simply run removeEvents as follows:   $ 'myElement' .removeEvents  ;  Cloning events from another element What if you wanted to copy all event listeners from another element? This could be useful  in situations where you clone an element using the clone MooTools element method.  Cloning an element doesn't copy the event listeners attached to it, so you also have to run  the cloneEvents method on the element being cloned if you wanted to also port the event  listeners to the copy.  To clone the events of an element, follow the format:     clone the element var original = $ 'originalElement' ; var myClone = original.clone  ;     clone the events from the original myClone.cloneEvents original ;  Firing off events Sometimes you want to fire off events manually. This is helpful in many situations, such as  manually firing off an event listener function that is triggered by another event. For example,  to fire off a click event on myElement, without having the user actually clicking on  myElement, you would do the following:  $ 'myElement' .fireEvent 'click' ;  Time for action – firing off a click event Imagine that you have a hyperlink with a click event listener attached to it, that when  triggered, alerts the user with a message. But you also want to fire off this alert message  when the user presses the Ctrl key. Here's how you'd do this:  1.	 First, let us place a hyperlink in an HTML document. We'll put it inside a     element and tell the users that clicking on the hyperlink or pressing the  Ctrl key will open up an alert dialog box.       Show a warning by clicking on this link:  Click  me . Alternatively, you can show the warning by pressing the   Ctrl  key on your keyboard.     [ 130 ]                                                                        Chapter 5  2.	 Next, let's add an event to   elements. We'll use the addEvent method to do this.     Add a click event $$ 'a' .addEvent 'click', function  {    alert 'You either clicked a link or pressed the Ctrl key.' ; } ;  3.	 Now we have to add another event listener onto our HTML document that   watches out for a keydown event. The function that the event listener executes  will check if the key pressed is the Ctrl key by using the control event  method, which returns a Boolean value of true if the Ctrl key is pressed.  If the key that was pressed is the Ctrl key, we ask it to fire the click event function  that we set in all our a elements by using the fireEvent method with click as  its parameter.     Add a keydown event on our web page window.addEvent 'keydown', function e {    If the keypress is the Ctrl key       manually fire off the click event    if e.control  {       $$ 'a' .fireEvent 'click' ;    } } ;  4.	 All together, our MooTools script should look like this:  window.addEvent 'domready', function  {       Add a click event    $$ 'a' .addEvent 'click', function  {       alert 'You either clicked a link or pressed the Ctrl key.' ;    } ;       Add a keydown event on our web page    window.addEvent 'keydown', function e {       If the keypress is the Ctrl key       manually fire off the click event    if e.control  {       $$ 'a' .fireEvent 'click' ;    }    } ; } ;  [ 131 ]                                                                        Working with Events  5.	 Test your HTML document in the web browser. Click on the Click me link.   It should show you the alert message we created. Press the Ctrl key as  well. It should also open up the same alert message we created.  The MooTools event object  The MooTools event object, which is part of the native component, is what allows us to  create and work with events. It's therefore worth it to take a bit of time to explore the   events object.  Using event object methods There are three event methods: preventDefault, stopPropagation, and stop.  Preventing the default behavior An event usually has a default behavior; that is, it has a predefined reaction in the instance  that the event is triggered. For example, clicking on a hyperlink will direct you to the URL  that href property is assigned to. Clicking on a Submit input field will submit the form to  the value that the action property of the form element is assigned to.  [ 132 ]                                                                        Chapter 5  Perhaps you want to open the page in a new window, but instead of using the non-standard  target property on an   element, you can use JavaScript to open the page in a new window.  Or maybe you need to validate a form before submitting it. You will want to prevent the default  behaviors of an event doing either one of these things. You can use the preventDefault  method to do so.  Time for action – preventing the default behavior of a hyperlink Imagine that you have a list of hyperlinks that go to popular sites. The thing is, you don't  want your website visitors to ever get to see them  at least coming from your site . You can  prevent the default behavior of your hyperlinks using the preventDefault method.  1.  Here is the HTML markup for a list of   elements that go to popular websites.   Place it inside an HTML document.  A list of links you can’t go to.          Google         Yahoo!          Digg       2.  We will warn the user with an alert dialog box that tells them they can't access  the links, even when they click on it. We'll fire this alert dialog box when a user  clicks on it. Notice the e argument in the function? That is the event object that is  passed into the function, allowing us to access events' methods and properties.   $$ 'a' .addEvent 'click', function e { alert 'Sorry you can\'t go there. At least not from this page.' ;   } ;  3.  Open your HTML document in a web browser and verify that the links still open  their destination, since we haven't prevented the default yet. You will, however,   see the alert dialog box we set up in step 2, showing you that, indeed, the   click event listener function fires off.  4.  Now we will prevent the links from opening by using the preventDefault   method. We'll just add the following line above the alert  ; line: e.preventDefault  ;  [ 133 ]                                                                        Working with Events  5.  Test the document again in your web browser. Clicking on any hyperlink   opens the alert dialog box, but doesn't open the hyperlink.  Preventing event bubbling Event bubbling occurs when you have an element inside another element. When an event  is triggered from the child element, the same event is triggered for the parent element, with  the child element taking precedence by being triggered first.  You can prevent event bubbling using the stopPropagation method. Let's explore the  concept of event bubbling and how to prevent it from occurring  if you want to , using the  stopPropagation event method.  Time for action – preventing event bubbling Let's say you have two divs, one inside another. When a div is clicked, it will open up the alert  box that displays the div's ID property value.  1.  Let's start with the HTML. In the following HTML markup, we have two div elements.   The parent div has an ID of parent and the child div has an ID of child.         parent               child   [ 134 ]                                                                        Chapter 5  2.  We'll style them with different background colors, widths, and heights so we              can see each div better. parent {    width:200px;    height:200px;    background-color: 999; } child {    width:100px;    height:100px;    background-color:ccc; }  3.  Open the HTML browser. You should see the following:  4.  Let's explore the concept of event bubbling by adding a click event on all   divs in the web page. When the click event is triggered, we will display  an alert dialog box with the ID of the div that triggered the event.  [ 135 ]                                                                        Working with Events     $$ 'div' .addEvent 'click', function e {       alert 'You clicked on ' + this.get 'id'  ;    } ;  5.  Open or refresh your work in your web browser. Click on the parent div.   You should see one alert dialog box that displays the ID of the parent div.  6.  This step is where you'll see event bubbling in action. Click on the child div. You  should see two alert boxes, one right after the other. The first one will display an  alert that you clicked on child div, and the second one will alert you that you  clicked on parent div, effectively running the same function twice in one click.  [ 136 ]                                                                        Chapter 5  7.  Let's prevent event bubbling from occurring. All we have to do is add this one line   of code above the alert   line in step 4. alert 'You clicked on ' + this.get 'id'  ;  8.  Refresh your HTML document. Click on the child element. You should only see   one alert dialog box this time. In effect, we've prevented event bubbling, which is  helpful when you only want to run the event's function once, not multiple times.  What just happened? You've learned the concept of event bubbling, which is a useful thing to know because event  bubbling can yield unexpected results if you don't keep it in mind. Sometimes you want to  run a function only once, so you have to prevent the propagation of the event listener to the  parent elements.  We did this by using the stopPropagation MooTools event method.  [ 137 ]                                                                        Working with Events Stopping default behavior and event propagation If you want to stop the default behavior of an element  preventDefault  as well as  prevent event propagation  stopPropagation , you should use the "stop the event"  method. This is a combination of both methods and it's a great way to save lines of code   if you want to perform both operations.  If you had a link inside a   element, like so:    link    By default, clicking on this link will take you to the Digg.com website as well as trigger the  click event on the   element and the   element. To prevent this from happening, which  in essence means limiting the operation performed only to triggering the click event on the    element and nothing else, you can do the following:  $$ 'a' .addEvent 'click', function e {    e.stop  ; } ;  Using event properties MooTools event objects also contain a variety of properties  similar to the Browser  Properties in Chapter 4 . With these properties, you can find out many things about an  event. We've already used several of these properties in this chapter, such as the shift,  control, and key properties.  Here are all the properties of event objects. You can find a similar summary in the MooTools  official documentation In the Event section: http:  mootools.net docs core  Native EventEvent:constructor.    Event property code   Data type Number  What it does This property returns the key code that was pressed.  You can see a list of JavaScript Key Codes for standard  keyboard keys in Mozilla Developer Center, under KeyEvent:  https:  developer.mozilla.org en DOM  Event UIEvent KeyEvent.  For example, if the user presses the Enter key, the key code  number is 14, and thus event.code will return a number  value of 14.  [ 138 ]                                                                        Event property key   Data type String  shift  control  alt  meta  wheel  page.x   page.y   Boolean Boolean Boolean Boolean Number Number  Number  client.x   Number  client.y   Number  target   Element  relatedTarget  Element  Chapter 5  What it does Returns the lowercase value of the key pressed. For example, it  will return q if the Q key is pressed, and enter when the Enter  key is pressed. Possible values of the key property are: letters a - z numbers 0 - 9 'enter', 'up', 'down', 'left', 'right', 'space', 'backspace', 'delete',  and 'esc'. This property will return true if the Shift key was pressed. This property will return true if the Ctrl key was pressed. This property will return true if the Alt key was pressed. This property will return true if the Meta key was pressed. How many times the scoller button on a mouse was used. Returns the x coordinate position of the mouse relative to the  entire browser window. Returns the y coordinate position of the mouse relative to the  entire browser window. Returns the x coordinate position of the mouse relative to the  browser's viewport. Returns the y coordinate position of the mouse relative to the  browser's viewport. Returns the element or elements that are targeted by the  event. Returns the related element or elements that are targeted by  the event  useful for seeing what elements can be affected by  event bubbling .  [ 139 ]                                                                        Working with Events  Summary  Specifically, we covered:  We learned a lot in this chapter. We learned about web browser events and how they can  help us watch for, and react to, user actions. We saw events in action in web forms and in  a mythical web application that allows users to toggle a help tip box with a shortcut key.    Adding event listeners to elements: We learned how to add a single event listener,  as well as multiple event listeners, using the addEvent and addEvents methods.  You'll find a lot of use for these as you get into the more advanced facets   of MooTools.    Removing, cloning, and firing off events: We saw how to remove events from   elements using the removeEvent and removeEvents methods, cloning events  with the clone method, and systematically firing off events, even when they are   not triggered by users, using the fireEvent method.    Creating custom events: We found out how to create custom events to extend     Event properties and methods: We saw the available methods and properties that   MooTools' event object.  will help us work with events.  Your newfound understanding of events will tremendously help us in the chapter, when we  deal with the fun stuff: JavaScript effects and animation, which, you'll be glad to know, is the  topic of the next chapter.  [ 140 ]                                                                        6  Bringing Web Pages to Life with  Animation  Users expect a highly-interactive experience when interfacing with websites and  web applications. With MooTools, you can create stunning animation within  your web pages with MooTools' smooth and slick JavaScript effects.  In this chapter we shall:    Learn about the MooTools Fx class   Learn how to animate a CSS property of an element   Discover how to animate multiple CSS properties of an element   Investigate some of Fx's useful methods for working with MooTools effects  So let's get on with it!  MooTools' Fx class  The MooTools Fx class is where the magic happens  or at least, one of the places where it  happens . It contains the framework's animation effects logic that will help you transform  CSS properties in a smooth and slick fashion. Before we get started with the fun stuff, let's   go over the basics.                                                                        Bringing Web Pages to Life with Animation  Basic syntax Declaring a new Fx object follows the same syntax as declaring any other object in MooTools   like a new Event in Chapter 5 . You create a new Fx object using the following format:  var nameOfFxObject = new Fx [options] ;  However, it's unlikely that you will use the Fx class in the above manner, but rather, you'll  use one of its extensions  Fx.Tween or Fx.Morph .  Let's go over the options and properties you can use to define your animation effect.  Fx options You have a myriad of options that you can take advantage of inside the Fx class, giving you  unprecedented control over your JavaScript animation effects. In the following table, you'll  find the option name, the data type it accepts, its default value  if you don't declare a value  for the option , and what the option is for.  It's important to note that when constructing your Fx object, you do not need to include  any of these options because they're optional.  Option Name  Data Type  fps  number   Default Value What it's for 50  unit  string   link  string   'false'  'ignore'  Allows you to specify the number of frames per  second of the effect. The unit used for the effect transition  px, em, or  % . What to do when the effect starts. The values you  can use are:  'ignore': will ignore the other effects currently  running when this effect starts.  'cancel': will cancel other effects currently running  when this effect starts.  'chain': the effect will start as soon as currently  running effects end. How long the effect will last in milliseconds  that  is the value of 500 is half a second ; the longer it  is, the slower the transition. You can use numbers  or one of the three preset duration values: short   250 ms , normal  500 ms , and long  1000 ms .   [ 142 ]  duration  number or  string   500                                                                        Option Name  Data Type  transition  Default Value What it's for sine:in:out  Chapter 6  The mathematical formula used for the effect  transition. There's a big list of values you  can use to learn about all the different types  of transitions at the official MooTools Docs:  http:  mootools.net docs core Fx  Fx.Transitions  Now that you know the basics of the Fx class, it's time to get "Mooving" and shaking, and  that's what we'll do in the next part of the chapter.  Animating a CSS property with Fx.Tween  JavaScript animation effects have come a long way with the help of frameworks like  MooTools that allow you to perform very fine-tuned, slick animations that rival the likes   of Adobe Flash.  MooTools allows you to smoothly transition a CSS property from one value to another. For  example, if you would like to transition the width of an element from 100px to 200px, or the  color from ffffff to 000000, you can.  The term "tween" comes from the animation industry; it is when the animator fades a frame  into the picture while fading out the existing frame, giving the appearance of a smooth and  seamless transition between the two frames.  Fx.Tween is a class extension of Fx that deals with animating one CSS property value into  another. We'll explore just how cool Fx.Tween is with an example.  Time for action - creating a hide show FAQ page Let's say that you have a boring FAQ page on your website, and you'd like to add a bit of  interactivity to it, as well as shorten the page so that users can quickly find the questions  they're looking for. One of the ways we can achieve these two goals is by hiding the answers  to the questions, and then showing them when the user clicks on the question.  [ 143 ]                                                                        Bringing Web Pages to Life with Animation  To help us achieve our goals, we will use Fx.Tween to let users click on a frequently-asked  question, which would reveal their corresponding answers.  1.  We will start with the HTML.definition list   element so that we can  pair up the questions with their respective answers  dd . Here is the HTML  code we're going to use  place your questions inside the   element,  and their corresponding answers in the following   element .    My Product FAQ Page        ...Question 1...      ...Answer 1...      ...Question 2...      ...Answer 2...      ...Question 3...      ...Answer 3...      ...Question 4...      ...Answer 4...     2.  Let's make the FAQ page a bit prettier. We'll change the default font style  to Verdana. For the questions  dt , we'll give them green color, a green  bottom border, a bit of space in between each other, and change the cursor  property to pointer to indicate to the users that they are clickable. For the  answers  dd , we'll simply give them a bit of space from the questions.  [ 144 ]                                                                        Chapter 6  body {    font:normal 14px Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;    color:333; } dt {    color:030;    border-bottom:1px solid 090;    margin-top:20px;    cursor: pointer; } dd {    margin-top:5px; }  3.   It's MooTools time! First, let's create some objects, namely two arrays that  will hold all of the questions  called questions , and one that will hold the  answers  called answers . This will make our code a bit cleaner and easier  to read, as well as make the sets easier to reference later down the script. window.addEvent 'domready', function  {    Define some objects to make code cleaner    and easier to reference  [ 145 ]                                                                        Bringing Web Pages to Life with Animation  var questions = $$ 'dt' ; var answers = $$ 'dd' ;  4.  When the page first loads, we have to hide all of the answers. We  do this by using the .setStyle   method to immediately set the  opacity CSS property of all the answer elements  dd  to 0%.    On first load, hide the answers answers.setStyle 'opacity', 0 ;  5.  We will need an event listener for the event that a user clicks on a question, so we'll   use what we learned in Chapter 5 and utilize the addEvent   method to add a  click event listener to the questions. When the user clicks on a question, we want to get the index position of the  question so that we know which answer to show or hide. We do this using the  indexOf   method on the definition term set  dt  and then storing this numerical  value into a variable called questionIndex. If the user clicks on the first  question: questionIndex will be 0, second question: questionIndex is 1, and  so forth. Then we will pass questionIndex as an argument to a function called  toggleAnswer which we will create in the next step. Note that you do not have to  put the index position inside a variable like questionIndex, but doing so makes  the code a bit more readable.     Add click event listener to questions     all dt elements  questions.addEvent 'click', function  {       Get the index position of the question    var questionIndex = questions.indexOf this ;       Call toggleAnswer function with the index       of this question as the argument    toggleAnswer questionIndex ; } ;  6.  We're going to create a function that will deal with the hiding and showing   toggling  of the answers; we shall call this function toggleAnswer which  accepts an argument that points to the index position of the answer to show   or hide . The argument will be questionIndex from the previous step.    The toggleAnswer function function toggleAnswer index {  }  [ 146 ]                                                                        Chapter 6  7.   Inside toggleAnswer, we will declare a new Fx.Tween object called  toggleEffect. It will transition the opacity CSS property of the element we  pass to it, and the effect will have a short duration. The element we will pass   to it as an argument is the answer whose index matches the question that was   clicked  answers[index] .    var toggleEffect = new Fx.Tween answers[index], {       property : 'opacity',       duration : 'short'    } ;  8.  Next, we create a control structure for determining whether we will be transitioning   to 100% opacity  the question is hidden  or 0% opacity  the question is currently  showing . We use the get   method to see if the target element has a 0 opacity,  and if it does, we'll start the effect at 0% opacity, and then end at 100% opacity,  otherwise, we do the opposite. To start the toggleEffect animation, we use  the start   method and pass the starting value and ending value of the opacity.  We'll talk about the start   method in greater detail later on in the chapter.    if answers[index].getStyle 'opacity' ==0 {          If answer is hidden, transition to 100%       toggleEffect.start 0, 1 ;    } else {          Else if answer is shown, hide it          and transistion to 0%       toggleEffect.start 1, 0 ;    }  9.  Review the entire MooTools script that we wrote together. Here it is without   the comments.  window.addEvent 'domready', function  { var questions = $$ 'dt' ; var answers = $$ 'dd' ;  answers.setStyle 'opacity', 0 ;  questions.addEvent 'click', function  {    var questionIndex = questions.indexOf this ;    toggleAnswer questionIndex ; } ; function toggleAnswer index {    var toggleEffect = new Fx.Tween answers[index], {       property : 'opacity',  [ 147 ]                                                                        Bringing Web Pages to Life with Animation        duration : 'short'    } ;    if answers[index].getStyle 'opacity' ==0 {       toggleEffect.start 0, 1 ;    } else {       toggleEffect.start 1, 0 ;    } } } ;  What just happened? In the previous example, we used Fx.Tween to hide and show elements, namely dd  elements which contain the answers to a hypothetical set of frequently asked questions  dt .  We did this by getting the index position of the question, then sending it to a function called  toggleAnswer, which determines whether the corresponding answer is already showing or  not; if it's hidden, it fades the question in, if it is shown, then it fades it out.  [ 148 ]                                                                        Chapter 6  Have a go hero – modifying the hide show transition effect Try to see what happens when you modify the duration option  give it a slower or faster  value . You should notice that the effect becomes more pronounced and noticeable as   you increase the duration option of the Fx.Tween class instance.  Tweening a single CSS property using the tween   method Fx.Tween comes packed with a few helpful methods for quickly transitioning a CSS property  of an element. tween   is one such method that allows you to transition one CSS property  value to another with fewer keystrokes than declaring a new Fx.Tween instance.  Using .set 'tween', options  before starting the effect allows you to change the  options before using tween  . You should use tween   on an element  or set of elements   instead of creating a new instance of Fx.Tween to save some lines of code. We've used the  tween   method in a previous chapter, but let's talk about it in a bit more detail here.  Using tween   is simple, and follows the format:  $ yourelement .tween property, [startvalue, endvalue] ;  If you want to start the tween at the current value, then just providing an end value   will transition the element from the current value to the end value, that is:  $ yourelement .tween property, endvalue ;  tween   is a deceptively simple method that provides you a quick way of creating  highly-interactive and appealing user interaction.  Time for action – toggling the visibility of a div Imagine you have a div that you would like to hide or show. The tween   method will allow  you to do this very easily and with very few lines of code. Let's just jump right to it.  1.  First, we set up the HTML. We use an   tag as the trigger. When clicked   it will either hide or show the panel div depending on its visibility.  Toggle div           [ 149 ]                                                                        Bringing Web Pages to Life with Animation  2.	 We give the panel div some simple styles by changing its background color  to gray and giving it a black border. This step is optional but it makes it easier   to see the transition. panel {    background-color:ccc;    border:1px solid 000; }  3.	 Moving on to MooTools. First, we declare a variable that holds the   element.   This makes it easier to reference in our code. We also immediately set the opacity   of the panel div to 0.       target is the div we hide or show    var target = $ 'panel' ;       Hide div immediately    target.setStyle 'opacity',0 ;  4.	 Finally, we add a click event for the   element. When the click event is triggered,   we tween the opacity CSS property of the panel div. If the opacity is currently  0, we set the end value to 1, and if the opacity is 1, we set the end value to 0.       Click event    $$ 'a' .addEvent 'click', function  {          Tween opacity to 1 if currently 0, tween to 0 if          currently 1       target.tween 'opacity', target.getStyle 'opacity' ==0 ? 1 :          0 ;    } ;  5.	 Test your work in a browser. At first, the panel div should be hidden   when the page loads. When you click on the   element, it will animate  the visibility of the panel div. Clicking on the   element when the  panel div is shown should animate the div to be hidden again.  [ 150 ]                                                                        Chapter 6  What just happened? We learned how to use the tween   method by hiding and showing a web page element.  More specifically, we animated the opacity CSS property of a div using the tween   method.  Fading elements There is another shortcut method for animating elements within the Fx.Tween class, called  fade  , that simply fades an element in and out. Rather than talking about it in length, let's  just jump right into it with an example.  [ 151 ]                                                                        Bringing Web Pages to Life with Animation  Time for action - fading an image in and out Imagine that you have an element  or a set of elements  that you'd like to fade in and out  from a web page. We can use the fade   method, in conjunction with event listeners, to  make this happen with very few lines of code. This can be used for simple hide and show  interactions, much like in the earlier example in this chapter with FAQ's.  1.  We'll be fading an image in and out of a web page. We use a click event  on a link to trigger the animation. For the image, we'll use an image from  my Flickr account: http:  www.flickr.com photos 31288116@ N02 3380520852 in set-72157615731243219 .  2.	 We'll use two sizes of the images, one small and one big. The small   one, when clicked, will fade in the bigger image, much like in thumbnail  galleries. To download the small image, visit this link: http:  farm4. static.flickr.com 3636 3380520852_5494538698_s_d.jpg  3.	 Download the large image using this link: http:  farm4.static.  flickr.com 3636 3380520852_5494538698_d.jpg  [ 152 ]                                                                        Chapter 6  4.  Store both images in the same directory with your HTML document   that you will use for this example, so that we can easily reference them.  Rename them to a shorter file name. How about flower_small. jpg for the small one and flower_large.jpg for the larger one? 5.  Let's start with the HTML code. We'll simply put the images inside   paragraph elements. The smaller image  the thumbnail  will have a class  of .small, and the larger version will have a class of .large.    <img class="small" src="flower_small.jpg" width="75"           height="75"  >   <img class="large" src="flower_large.jpg" width="404"           height="500"  >     6.  First, we need to hide the larger image immediately when the first  page loads; we do so with the .setStyle method with opacity as  the property argument, and 0 as the property value to set it to.    Set opacity immediately to 0 $$ '.large' .setStyle 'opacity', 0 ;  7.  Next we need a click event listener on the thumbnail; we'll target   the .small class and add a click event listener to it. $$ '.small' .addEvent 'click', function  {      Code to execute } ;  8.   It's time to utilize the .fade method. First, we create an object called large,  just to make our code a bit cleaner. Then we run the fade method on large.   We feed fade either a 1 or 0 using a ternary control structure; if the opacity  of large is 0, then we fade to 1  showing it , otherwise, we fade to 0 opacity. $$ '.small' .addEvent 'click', function  {       Make code cleaner    var large = $$ '.large' ;       Run fade on method on .large         If opacity of .large is 0 fade to 1         Otherwise, fade to 0    large.fade  large.get 'opacity'  == 0  ? 1 : 0 ; } ;  [ 153 ]                                                                        Bringing Web Pages to Life with Animation  9.  Review the script we wrote together. Here it is without comments.  window.addEvent 'domready', function  { $$ '.large' .setStyle 'opacity', 0 ; $$ '.small' .addEvent 'click', function  {       var large = $$ '.large' ;       large.fade  large.get 'opacity'  == 0  ? 1 : 0 ; } ; } ;  Now, test the web page in a web browser.  [ 154 ]                                                                        Chapter 6  What just happened? We learned how to use one of the Fx.Tween shortcuts, the fade method. We applied it to  an image to create a gallery style effect where you click on a thumbnail  flower_small. jpg  and it shows the full scale version of itself  flower_large.jpg .  Now we're ready to move on to another awesome Fx.Tween shortcut.  Highlighting elements The other Fx.Tween shortcut that is helpful is the highlight method. You can use the  highlight method to draw attention to elements by momentarily transitioning its background  color, creating a "flashing" or "blinking" effect.  If you use the highlight method without any options, it uses a light yellow color  ff8  as  the "highlighting" color and makes the background of the element flash for a split second   to draw the user's attention to it.  Time for action - indicating blank form fields that are required Let's see what the highlight method can do for us. We're going to use it on a web form.  1.  First we'll set up the form's HTML.        First Name:  <input  name="firstName" type="text"  >        Last Name:  <input name="lastName"  type="text"  >        Email:  <input name="email"  type="text"  >      [ 155 ]                                                                        Bringing Web Pages to Life with Animation  2.	 Then we target all the input elements and add a focus event listener to them.   When an input field is focused on, we grab its parent  p  element and then  run the highlight method on that element to animate its background color.    $$ 'input' .addEvent 'focus', function  {       this.getParent 'p' .highlight  ;    } ;  On testing the above script in a web browser, you should see that the background  color momentarily flashes to a light yellow color, and then fades back to the original  background color  which defaults to transparent or no color in most web browsers .  3.	 Let's see what happens when we pass one color value to the method as an   argument. This effectively functions as the starting color of the highlight. We'll use   a blue color  6dcff6 .    $$ 'input' .addEvent 'focus', function  {       this.getParent 'p' .highlight '6dcff6' ;    } ;  [ 156 ]                                                                        4.	 Now let's modify it so that we pass both a starting and ending value for the color  options. You should see the blue color transitioning to the red color, then the red  color transitioning to the element's default background color  transparent .    $$ 'input' .addEvent 'focus', function  {       this.getParent 'p' .highlight '6dcff6', 'ff0000' ;    } ;  Chapter 6  [ 157 ]                                                                        Bringing Web Pages to Life with Animation  What just happened? We explored the highlight method and how we can use it to draw attention to the focused  input fields on a web form. By passing no color options to the method, it uses a light yellow  color that acts as a "blinking" or "flashing" animation effect. With one option, it replaces the  default light yellow color to the one we've specified, and with two options, it uses the first  color passed as the starting value, the second color as the ending value, before transitioning  back to its original background color  which is transparent or 0% opacity .  Now that we've fully seen what Fx.Tween can do for us, let's see how we can use more than  one CSS property to animate elements.  Animating multiple CSS properties with Fx.Morph  When you want to transition more than one CSS property at the same time, you'll have to  use another Fx class extension, Fx.Morph. The biggest difference between Fx.Morph and  Fx.Tween is that the former is able to transition more than one CSS property simultaneously   imagine transitioning the color, width, and height of an element at the same time .  Let's learn about Fx.Morph through an example!  Time for action - enlarging an image Say you have an image that you'd like to scale up or down when the user clicks on it.  This type of interaction is common in thumbnail galleries where images are displayed in  thumbnails so that the web page can display many images at once. When the user clicks on  an image that they find interesting, it enlarges so they can see the full size.   We'll do this for one image, but I'm sure that once you're done with the chapter, you can  figure out how to apply it to multiple images on a web page  if you wish .  1.  Let's grab an image to use for the example. You can download an image from one of  my Flickr sets of a blue flower and save on your local machine as blueflower.jpg:  http:  farm4.static.flickr.com 3429 3379703917_835a79555f_d.jpg  [ 158 ]                                                                        Place the image in an HTML document with an ID of "image".    <img id="image" src="blueflower.jpg" width="500" height="301"  alt="blue flower"  >    Chapter 6  2.  First, we'll declare a bunch of variables for helping us easily reference them.        Create variable for easier referencing    var image = $ 'image' ;       Get the current width, height, opacity as numbers    var width = image.getProperty 'width' .toInt  ;    var height = image.getProperty 'height' .toInt  ;    var opacity = image.getStyle 'opacity' .toInt  ;  3.  Next, we immediately set the width and height of the image to 25% of its   original value, and its opacity to 50% of its value by using division operations.       On page load, reduce width and height to 25%       reduce opacity to 50%    image.setStyles {       'width' : width   4,       'height' : height   4,       'opacity' : opacity   2    } ;  4.  We add an event listener to our image to listen for mouse clicks on itself.        Click event listener    image.addEvent 'click', function  {          code to execute    } ;  5.   Inside the click event listener, the first thing we will do is add a class property of  "enlarged". We use the toggleClass method, which adds the specified class if it's  not there, or remove the class if isn't there. This is how we'll know if the image is   thumbnail size or full size  enlarged .          Toggle enlarge class value       this.toggleClass 'enlarged' ;  [ 159 ]                                                                        Bringing Web Pages to Life with Animation  6.  Next we set up the Morph object. Instead of the default transition type, we'll   use one of my favorite transition types: Fx.Transitions.Bounce.easeOut  which does a bouncy type of animation.          Declare Fx.Morph object       var scaleEffect = new Fx.Morph this, {          'duration' : 550,          'transition' : Fx.Transitions.Bounce.easeOut       } ;  7.  Next we start the effect. We use the hasClass   method to determine whether   or not the image is thumbnail class or if it is already enlarged, so that we know   what values to transition to.          Start the effect       var enlarged = this.hasClass ‘enlarged’ ;        scaleEffect.start {             If the element has a class of enlarged             Then we scale all properties to 100%,             Otherwise we scale it down to 25% width height             and 50% opacity          'width' : enlarged ? width : width   4,          'height' : enlarged ? height : height   4,          'opacity' : enlarged ? opacity : opacity   2       } ;  8.  Review the script we wrote together, here it is all together without comments.  window.addEvent 'domready', function  {    var image = $ 'image' ;    var width = image.getProperty 'width' .toInt  ;    var height = image.getProperty 'height' .toInt  ;    var opacity = image.getStyle 'opacity' .toInt  ;     image.setStyles {       'width' : width   4,       'height' : height   4,       'opacity' : opacity   2    } ;     image.addEvent 'click', function  {  [ 160 ]                                                                        Chapter 6        this.toggleClass 'enlarged' ;        var scaleEffect = new Fx.Morph this, {          'duration' : 550,          'transition' : Fx.Transitions.Bounce.easeOut       } ;        var enlarged = this.hasClass ‘enlarged’ ;        scaleEffect.start {          'width' : enlarged ? width : width   4,          'height' : enlarged ? height : height   4,          'opacity' : enlarged ? opacity : opacity   2       } ;    } ; } ;  9.  Test your work. If done correctly, when you click on the image it should enlarge.   If you click on it again, it should shrink back to the smaller, thumbnail size.  [ 161 ]                                                                        Bringing Web Pages to Life with Animation  What just happened? In the previous example, we witnessed how fun Fx.Morph can be. We used an image that  we shrunk down to thumbnail size, and then we added a click event listener to it. When the  image is clicked, we use Fx.Morph transition, configuring the width, height, and opacity  properties of the image, all at the same time.  Have a go hero – modify the transition type In the above example, I used my favorite transition type. There are a lot more types of  transitions and the best way to find about all the different types of transitions is heading  over to the MooTools Official Docs site, Fx.Transitions.  http:  mootools.net docs core Fx Fx.Transitions  Modify the example by changing the transition option value to ones that you find interesting.  Using the morph   shortcut method Fx.Morph comes with a useful method called morph   that you can use on elements to  transition their CSS properties with very few lines of code. What's cool about morph   is  that it can also use a class name as an argument, so if you have a class in your stylesheet  with style properties, you can use it. Like the tween   method in Fx.Tween, you can use  .set 'morph' options  on the element to change the options before calling morph  .  Enough of chit-chat! Let's just jump right into it to see how exactly the morph method works.  Time for action - experimenting with morph To explore the morph method, we will use a div with text inside it to morph several of  its properties.  1.  We will use an element to trigger the animation effect. We will run the animation on   2.  We will give morphDiv some CSS styles to modify its default styles.  a div element with an ID of morphDiv.  Morph        My Morphing Box.     morphDiv {    width:100px;    height:100px;    border:1px solid 333;  [ 162 ]                                                                           background:ccc;    font:normal 12px Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; }  Chapter 6  3.  We add a click event listener to the   element so that when it's clicked, it  executes the morph method on morphDiv. We transition several properties.    $$ 'a' .addEvent 'click', function  {       $ 'morphDiv' .morph {          'width' : 200,          'height' : 200,          'border' : '5px dashed ff0000',          'font-size' : '24px'       } ;    } ;  [ 163 ]                                                                        Bringing Web Pages to Life with Animation  4.  When you click on the   element, it should transition all of the CSS   properties of morphDiv to the values we've specified in step 3.  5.  Let's declare a style rule for a class called morphed, with the exact   values we used in the morph method arguments in step 3. .morphed {    width:200px;    height:200px;    border:5px dashed ff0000;    font-size:24px; }  6.  Let's modify the code in step 3 to instead use morphed as the argument.     $$ 'a' .addEvent 'click', function  {       $ 'morphDiv' .morph '.morphed' ;    } ;  7.  Test your work again. It should still perform the exact same transition.  [ 164 ]                                                                        What just happened? We saw how we could save a few lines of code using the morph   method. First, we used  CSS properties as arguments to specify the end value of our transition effect. Then we used   a class argument to perform the same transition effect.  Chapter 6  Other Fx methods  There are several Fx methods that are useful for working with animation Fx. You've already  seen one of them, the start   method, which simply starts an animation effect. In this  section, we shall go over methods available to you when working with MooTools animation.  Starting an effect The start   method allows you to start an effect. It takes in the properties you'd like to  transition, and their end value. Here are a few examples of using the start method format on  instances of Fx.Tween and Fx.Morph.     In Fx.Tween this transitions the width from the current value     to 100px myTween.start 'width', 100 ;    In Fx.Tween this transitions the width from 50px to 100px myTween.start 'width', 50, 100 ;     In Fx.Morph this transitions the height to 100 and the color     to ff0000 myMorph.start {    'height' : 100,    'color' : ff0000 } ;    In Fx.Morph this transitions the height from 50px to 100px myMorph.start {    'height' : [50px, 100px] } ;  Setting properties immediately If you want to set CSS properties immediately without a transition, you should use the  set   method. This method is useful for quickly setting CSS properties and can be a great  way to 'reset' properties to their original values without a transition.  Here's an example which sets the opacity to 0%.  var effect = new Fx.Tween 'myElement', {'duration' : 'short'} ;    myElement is set to 0 opacity immediately effect.set 'opacity', 0 ;  [ 165 ]                                                                        Bringing Web Pages to Life with Animation  Cancelling a transition There may be instances when you want to cancel a transition immediately while it is still  running. If so, you can use the cancel   method which stops the specified transition. Used  with event listeners, you can cancel an effect when certain events occur.  Here's an example format:  myEffect.cancel  ;  Pausing effect Instead of cancelling an effect, maybe you'd just like to pause it. If so, you can use the  pause   method. It uses the following format:  myEffect.pause  ;  Resuming a paused effect If you'd like to resume an effect that you paused, you can use the resume   method.  The format is similar to the pause  , and cancel  , methods:  myEffect.resume  ;  Summary  In this chapter we learned about JavaScript animation effects:    We covered the basic Fx syntax and options available to you, so that you can have   utmost control over your animation effects    We learned how to animate one CSS property with the Fx.Tween   We covered some useful effects methods in the Fx.Tween class: tween  , fade  ,   and highlight      We then learned how to animate multiple CSS properties with Fx.Morph, as well  as learned a shortcut method called morph   that allows us to quickly transition  several CSS properties at once    Finally, we briefly covered other Fx methods for starting, cancelling, pausing, and   resuming effect transitions  Now that we know about animation effects, it's time to move onto even more interactivity   in our web pages, and next chapter, we're going to super-charge our web pages with Ajax!

With Ajax, websites and web applications become highly-responsive, no longer  needing to request an entire page's content when new data is available. You  have the ability to request certain types of data as well as only update parts  that you need to update. What this ultimately means is that websites that leverage Ajax techniques are  able to provide the user a much fuller and seamless experience that provides  them with instantaneous server-side data. There is less waiting for requested  information on the user's behalf and our web servers save bandwidth by not  having to reacquire an entire web page's content. JavaScript is at the forefront of this evolution of websites and web applications. MooTools helps us write our Ajax scripts quicker, faster, and better.  This chapter shows you how to deal with Ajax requests and responses. By the end, you will  have enough expertise on the subject to be able to implement Ajax functionalities into your  web applications. In this chapter, we shall:     Learn about MooTools' Request class   Discover how to create Ajax Request objects   Find out how to get data from the server and other files asynchronously   Figure out how to send data to the server without a page refresh   Learn about HTTP headers and the methods available to us in working with them  Let's get started, shall we?                                                                        Going 2.0 with Ajax  What you'll need  Before you begin your Ajax adventure, you should be aware that—because of the JavaScript  security model—most of the examples in this chapter require a web server or a local host  web server installed on your computer for you to get the examples to work.  If you have a remote web hosting account, you should upload your files through FTP in a  location where you can test it.  If you don't have a web server available, it's quite easy to install one on your computer.   Some notable web server packages include WAMP and XAMPP.  On my site, you can find a step-by-step tutorial on installing XAMPP which you can read   and review to get you up and running in no time. What's great about XAMPP is that it is   one of the few tools you can use that is compatible with Windows, Mac OS, and Linux  operating systems.  http:  sixrevisions.com tutorials web-development-tutorials using- xampp-for-local-wordpress-theme-development   Creating a Request object  In order to start utilizing the Ajax features of MooTools, let's take a few moments to discuss  the Request class.  The Request class is MooTools' class for creating Request objects for dealing with Ajax-based  HTTP server-side client-side communication. With this class, you'll be able to easily send and  retrieve data, as well as perform useful operations on these data.  To create a Request object, use the following format:  var requestObject = new Request options ;  The Request class is feature-packed; it has oodles of options for making your life as an Ajax  developer much easier. Let's look at the options available to you.  Request object options In the following table, you will see the Request class options. You will see the option name,  the data type that it accepts, its default value, and what it's for. We will use several of these  throughout the chapter, so it would be ideal if you reviewed them now.  [ 168 ]                                                                        Request option url  Data type   Default value String   null  method  String   'post'  data  link  String   ' '  String   'ignore'  async  Boolean   true  encoding headers isSuccess evalScripts  String   'utf-8' Object   null function Boolean   true  evalResponse  Boolean   false  emulation  Boolean   true  urlEncoded noCache  Boolean   true Boolean   false  Chapter 7  What it does The url option points to the location of the file  where data is to be sent.  Example, 'http:  example.com scripts ajax.php'  or ' scripts ajax.php' The HTTP method used to send data. Possible  values: 'post' or 'get'. The data to be sent. When no data is explicitly  mentioned, it sends an empty string. What to do when another request is created  while this request is running.  'ignore' will not run the new request.  'cancel' will stop the current request.  'chain' will perform the request after the  current request has been made.  If set to false, only the current request  can run, making the request "synchronous".  Possible values: true or false. The character set type of the data to be set. An object for HTTP request headers. Function to execute when request is successful. Evaluates code inside   tags in HTML  document. If true, evaluates the entire response  data set. If set to true, other HTTP request methods  other than 'post' and 'get' are allowed  where the method is sent as post-data named  '_method'. If true, URL encodes data set.  Prevents caching, specifically to remedy Internet  Explorer cache settings that are troublesome for  refreshed data.  [ 169 ]                                                                        Going 2.0 with Ajax  Request events options The Request class has its own event listeners. They're used for performing operations during  certain situations of an Ajax request. Let's take a few moments to discuss them here.  Running a function immediately when a request is made If you want to run a function just when a request is made, you can do so with  onRequest. Here is an example that alerts users when a request is sent to a file on  the server called myscript.php.     var makeRequest = new Request  {       url: 'myScript.php',       onRequest: function  {           alert 'You just sent a request!' ;       }    } ;  Running a function when the request is completed If you want to run a function after the request has been completed, you can do so with  onComplete. You should only use this option when you want to run a function when the  request is finished, regardless if it was a success or not. Here is an example:     var makeRequest = new Request  {       url: 'myScript.php',       onComplete: function response {           $ 'log-box' .inject response ;       }    } ;  Running a function when the request is cancelled Sometimes you want to cancel an ongoing request. A situation might be that a new request  is triggered by the user and it conflicts with the current request. If you want to run a function  when the request has been cancelled, you can do so with the onCancel option. Here is an  example:     var makeRequest = new Request  {       url: 'myScript.php',       onCancel: function  {           alert 'You cancelled the previous Ajax request!' ;       }    } ;  [ 170 ]                                                                        Chapter 7  Other Request events Sometimes, things don't work out and your request is terminated. At that event you only  want to run a certain function if the request is successful; use the onSuccess option.  On the same token, if you only want to run a function when the request fails,  use onFailure.  When you want to run a function when an exception in the HTTP header occurs, check   out onException.  Now that we know the Request class inside out, it's time to see it in action. We'll start   by learning how to request data from remote files.  Requesting data  One of the most basic tasks involved in Ajax RIA development is requesting data from server  files. We will learn about a method for requesting static data.  Time for action – requesting remote data Imagine that you have a file on the server that contains data that you'd like to use on a web  page. We will devise a way to get that data, and then display it on our web page without  requiring a page refresh.  1.  Create an HTML document that will hold our remote data, and save it with   the file name of mydata.html.  2.	  In mydata.html, put in some HTML content. This is what I used, but feel free  to put your own valid HTML markup:  This is some  remote  data that I requested.   3.	 Next we need an HTML document that will be our web page that requests the   data from mydata.html. Create this HTML document and place it in the  same location as mydata.html.  [ 171 ]                                                                        Going 2.0 with Ajax  4.	  In our web page HTML document, we place an   element that will serve as  the trigger for making our Ajax request. This document also has a div where  we will place the data we get from mydata.html; give this div an ID of  content-holder. In the HTML document, we use the following markup:  Click this to request data.   &nbsp;   5.	 The first thing we should do is write an event listener for the   element.  Here, we utilize the addEvent method with an event argument of click. window.addEvent 'domready', function  {  $$ 'a' .addEvent 'click', function  {          Code to execute goes here    } ; } ;  6.	 Next, we build our Request object; we're going to call it requestData. We  point to the location of our remote data  mydata.html  via the url option. Then, when our request has been completed, we update the content-holder  div's content with the response that we get from the request; we do this with   our trusty set   method.  window.addEvent 'domready', function  {    $$ 'a' .addEvent 'click', function  {       var requestData = new Request  {          url: 'mydata.html',          onComplete: function response {              $ 'content-holder' .set 'html', response ;          }       } ;    } ; } ;  [ 172 ]                                                                        7.	 Now the only thing left is to send the request; we do so with the send   method   included in the Request class.       requestData.send  ;  8.	 Test your work in a web browser. When you click on the   element, the page   should display the HTML data we got from mydata.html, without a page refresh.   Chapter 7  What just happened? In the above example, we learned the very basics of how Ajax works; we can request data  from a file and then load that data in using JavaScript. Imagine if we had sent the request to  a server-side script, that, when passed a value gives us a result  all in the background . The  possibilities are endless!  Note that the example we just did will not work if you're not running your web  page in a web server. The above example, and subsequent examples in this  chapter, must run in a web server. If you have a web host account, upload your  files in a testing directory. If you don't have one, install a web server package on  your local machine, and use a web server deployment package such as XAMPP  to make this easier.  Requesting HTML and JSON data You can use the general Request class to get all sorts of data, but if you know that you'll be  working with HTML or JSON data, there is the Request.HTML and Request.JSON classes  that extend the Request class with useful features specifically for those formats.  [ 173 ]                                                                        Going 2.0 with Ajax Working with HTML data In the previous example, we requested an entire HTML document. By using Request.HTML,  we can work more easily with data returned as HTML. We'll learn about this subclass by way  of an example.  Time for action – updating a web page with HTML We'll use the Request.HTML to update a web page with HTML data. This can be useful  when you are receiving data as HTML markup.  1.	 First, we create a text file that holds our HTML data. Save this text file in the same location as the HTML document that will contain your MooTools code. For the text   file, I used the following markup  and again, feel free to customize your   HTML document :                     List item 1         List item 2         List item 3            2.	 Create a new HTML document that will serve as our web page; it will contain our  3.	 Create an event handler for the   element being clicked  which triggers the request .  MooTools code and the following HTML markup:    Click to make the request!             window.addEvent 'domready', function  {    $$ 'a' .addEvent 'click', function  {       code goes in here.    } ; } ;    [ 174 ]                                                                        Chapter 7  4.	 Let's build our Request.HTML object. We use the url option to point to our   myhtmldata.txt file. We use the update option to specify what element we want  to update with the requested data. We chain the send   method as a shortcut.    $$ 'a' .addEvent 'click', function  {       var requestHTMLData = new Request.HTML  {          url: 'myhtmldata.txt',          update: $ 'holder'        } .send  ;    } ;  5.	 Test your work in the web browser. When you click on the link, it should update   the holder div with the unordered list we placed in myhtmldata.txt.  What just happened? We learned how to load remote data from a text file into our HTML document using   the Request.HTML class.  In the process, we encountered a nifty class option that can be used throughout the  Request.HTML class called update that will update an HTML element in the web page  with the received data. Additionally, we learned that we can chain the send   right after  declaring the Request object to immediately send the request as soon as it is created.  Loading HTML documents remotely If you have HTML documents that you would like to load into a web page, you can easily do  so with the load   method for Request.HTML. Let's explore this useful method by way of  an example.  [ 175 ]                                                                        Going 2.0 with Ajax  Time for action – loading HTML data We're going to give the user the option to load data from other HTML files. This gives us the  ability to provide them with requested data on demand.  1.  Start by creating two HTML documents that will serve as our remote HTML data.  Save them as htmlremote1.html and htmlremote2.html. Place some sample  HTML markup to help you determine which file is being loaded. Here is what   I used for htmlremote1.html:     This is data from  htmlremote1.html    2.  Next, create a new HTML document that will be our web page that loads the two   HTML documents. Name it anything you like, but save it in the same location   as the two other HTML files.  3.   In our HTML document, we will add two   elements that will serve as means  for the user to request the data they want. We also create a div element  with an ID of load-area that will contain the HTML that we retrieve.  Load content from htmlremote1. html    Load content from htmlremote2. html      4.  We will create an event listener for the event that an   element is clicked,   using the addEvent   method.   window.addEvent 'domready', function  {    $$ 'a' .addEvent 'click', function  {          Code goes in here    } ; } ;    [ 176 ]                                                                        Chapter 7  5.  Before we work on the code logic for loading in the remote HTML files, we should   first determine the ID of the link that was clicked so that we know which file  to load; we conveniently place it in a variable named linkID for later use.       var linkID = this.get 'id' ;  6.  Then we run the load   method on the load-area element so that the   retrieved data is placed inside it. To indicate which HTML files to load, we use a  ternary operator with the logic: "if linkID is equal to load-htmlremote1 then  the value is htmlremote1.html, otherwise the value is htmlremote2.html".          Load the appropriate html document based on linkID value       $ 'load-area' .load  linkID=='load-htmlremote1'  ?        'htmlremote1.html' : 'htmlremote2.html' ;  7.  Test your work in a web browser. When you click on one of the links, it should load   the appropriate external HTML file.  [ 177 ]                                                                        Going 2.0 with Ajax Working with JSON data JSON, which stands for JavaScript Object Notation, is a standard data format written in  JavaScript syntax. It is a great way to interchange complex data sets because it's lightweight  and universal. For more information about JSON, visit http:  www.json.org.  Just as you would expect, MooTools has a class for working with JSON data: Request.JSON.  This subclass extends the Request class with tools and options specifically for working with  JSON objects.  This class works well alongside MooTools' JSON object which is MooTools' JSON parser   and encoder.  Time for action – working with Ajax and JSON In this example, we will use a JSON object from a remote server file to update a web page  when the user requests it.  1.  First, we need some sample JSON data to work with. In the following code block you   can see an example of a JSON object that you can use as your sample data.   Save this file as myjsondata.json. {    "name": "Jacob Gube",    "age": 26,    "hairStyle": "Short",    "location": "Bloomington" }  2.	 Next, create an HTML document that will serve as the web page requesting JSON   data. This document contains the   element that triggers the request, and a div called holder that will be updated with the JSON data.  Click to make the JSON request!         3.	 The final step is building our Request.JSON object  named jsonRequest . In  this object, we point our request to our JSON file using the url option. By using  the onSuccess method, we can run a function that sets holder div's HTML  to the data inside the JSON object when the server's response is successful.    $$ 'a' .addEvent 'click', function  {       var jsonRequest = new Request.JSON {          url: 'myjsondata.json',          onSuccess: function personData {             $ 'holder' .set 'html',   [ 178 ]                                                                        Chapter 7              ' Name:  ' + personData.name +             '  Age:  ' + personData.age +             '  Hair Style:  ' +                  personData.hairStyle +             '  Location:  ' +                  personData.location ;          }    } .send  ;    } ;  4.	 Test your work in a web browser. When you click the   element, you should see  something like the following figure:  What just happened? In the previous example, we saw how the Request.JSON class works to our advantage.  JSON is a great way to exchange data because it's lightweight and standardized; it's ideal   for interoperable systems development.  Cancelling a Request If you would like to immediately cancel an ongoing Ajax request, you may do so using the  cancel   method. This can be helpful in terminating a specific Request object when a  certain event occurs. One reason you would cancel an Ajax request is if it conflicts with a  certain process.  The format of cancelling a request is:  requestObject.cancel    Now that we've learned about requesting data, we will now discuss how to pass data to  other files so that they can perform their own operations on that data.  [ 179 ]                                                                        Going 2.0 with Ajax  Sending data  In the previous section, we dealt with getting data from web server files; however, usually  we would also like to send data out of our web page.  Time for action – sending data to PHP We're going to demonstrate how powerful Ajax is via a simple example; we're going to send  a PHP script a string, and it will reverse the string as we type. We do this by asynchronously  updating the web page as the user presses on their keyboard.  This involves server-side scripting, and we'll use one of the most widely-available languages  out there—PHP. Chances are, your web server has the capability to run PHP files  and if you  followed my advice on installing XAMPP, you're all set . Don't worry, we won't be working  with complex PHP and if you know any language, even just JavaScript, you'll understand  what's going on.  This simulates more complex examples, such as sending in a user string, which PHP, or your  preferred server-side scripting language, processes to query the database and check if that  user string exists. Depending on the query's result, it will respond to MooTools accordingly.  1.  We'll start by creating our web page. The structure of our document will have a  textarea element that will house the text that the user types. Additionally, we  create an empty div element called response that will print out the response  we get from PHP. We use a label to display the instructions for the textarea.      Enter stuff:               2.  We start the JavaScript by creating a request instance first. We shall call it   ajaxRequest. This way we can reuse the request instead of having to create  a new one whenever the user types. For the url option, we use the value to  PHP script's file name  which we will create in the subsequent steps . Upon  a successful Ajax request and response, we update the HTML content of our  response div with the value that PHP sends back using the set   method.   window.addEvent 'domready', function  {}       var ajaxRequest = new Request {          url: 'php-script.php',          onSuccess: function response {  [ 180 ]                                                                        Chapter 7              $ 'response' .set 'html', response ;          }       } ;        Additional lines of code here } ;    3.  We need to construct an event handler for the user-input text area. First, we need to select it from the DOM, and to do so, we use the name= operator in the Selectors class to match the text area. We want to send our Ajax request whenever the user presses and then releases a keyboard key, so we listen  to the keyup event.    $$ 'textarea[name=user-input]' .addEvent 'keyup', function  {              Next lines of code will go here    } ;  4.  Next, we create a variable that takes the current value inside the text   area. Every time the user types something in the text area, this variable  will be updated and sent into our PHP script for processing. var value = this.get 'value' ;  5.  Now there are two more things we will have to do to send the Ajax request.   First we will have to use the .cancel   method to overcome stalled requests.  If a previous request takes longer to finish, it will complete later and update the  text content with old data. Then we will make the request with the .send    method by sending the data option. We assign it an HTTP URL variable  called userInput with the value of what is currently in the text area. ajaxRequest.cancel  .send {    data: {'userInput': value} } ;  6.  Finally, we create the PHP script. To start, place the following code block inside a  new document in your source code text editor. Then save it in the same location  as your HTML document using the file name php-script.php. The script is very  simple; it puts the data that we sent  userInput  into a holder variable called  $dataSent. Then we pass that variable into a PHP function called strrev  , which  simply reverses the string. We put the output of that function into a variable called  $dataToSendBack. The last task is printing out the PHP response, which is what  gets sent back to our client-side script. The last line that starts with echo is what the  response argument in the onSuccess method in our MooTools script will contain.  [ 181 ]                                                                        Going 2.0 with Ajax  <?php    Put the data that is sent into a variable $dataSent = $_POST['userInput'];    Pass the current input to a function called strrev which    reverses the string and place into dataToSendBack $dataToSendBack = strrev $dataSent ;    Send back back the new variable echo ' You are typing backwards:    '.$dataToSendBack; ?>  7.  Test your work on a web browser. Type in some text. You should see the   response div updated every time there is a keystroke.  [ 182 ]                                                                        Chapter 7  What just happened? In the preceding example, we saw how to talk to the server using MooTools. Specifically, we  used the MooTools Request class to create an Ajax Request object that sent the user input  to a PHP script. That PHP script took the user input and operated upon it; it ran the data into  a PHP function called strrev   that reversed the string. After the PHP process was done,  it sent back the processed data to our client-side script, we then took the response and  performed a DOM manipulation to insert the data into a div called response.  Through this simple example, we witnessed Ajax in action. We saw how we could  communicate with the server, sending and receiving data from a script, without needing a  web page reload. This created a seamless experience, one that would be valuable in web  applications that mimic functionalities and instant feedback that desktop applications have.  Setting and getting HTTP headers  HTTP headers are meta information about an HTTP response; they define a lot of  information about the data that you are sending and receiving. For example, with the   Cache-Control HTTP response header, you can determine whether your data will be cached  on the user's browser, and the Date HTTP request header gets a timestamp of the request.  This information is contained in the documents that you request, but is not shown explicitly  in the HTML document's source code. But you can easily attain and set HTTP request and  response headers by using JavaScript.  For a full list of HTTP headers, please view the Wikipedia page entitled List of  HTTP headers via the following HTTP address: http:  en.wikipedia. org wiki List_of_HTTP_headers.  Setting an HTTP header for an Ajax Request object When you create a MooTools Request object, you can choose to set HTTP headers for it  using the setHeader   method in the Request class. For example, let's say you created a  Request object called myRequest; to set an HTTP header value pair, follow the format:  myRequest.setHeader 'headername', 'headervalue' ;  If you want to set Cache-Control to instruct the browser not to cache the information  being requested, you would write:  myRequest.setHeader 'Cache-Control', 'no-cache' ;  [ 183 ]                                                                        Going 2.0 with Ajax  One instance where you would want to do this is when requesting sensitive data that  you don't want to store in the user's computer, or if you want to avoid caching issues for  constantly-updated data  such as Flash objects . Doing this will not guarantee that the  browser will actually follow your command, but in most instances, it would work.  Alternatively, you can use the headers option when creating the prototype of your Request  object to set HTTP headers.  Getting an HTTP header Whenever you get a server response, it provides you contextual information about that  particular response via HTTP headers. Think of it as meta information. Sometimes you want  to obtain this information after a successful Ajax response. Perhaps, you want to know the  date the response was sent to output to the user how long an Ajax request response took,  or how the data is encoded.  Use the getHeader   method in the MooTools Request class to obtain this information.  The format of getting HTTP headers about a Request object is as follows:  myRequest.getHeader 'headername' ;  If you want to see when the HTTP response was sent, you could write:  myRequest.getHeader 'Date' ;  Let us explore the setting and getting of HTTP headers by way of example.  Time for action – getting the Last-Modified HTTP header We are going to get HTTP headers from the server during our Ajax request. This can be  helpful in displaying contextual information about the server that's sending us our response.  In this particular instance, we're going to determine when the file that we requested was   last modified.  1.  The first thing we're going to do is get the time when our HTML document was   last modified. Start by creating an HTML document and saving it onto your   server with MooTools ready to go.  2.	 Next, set up our MooTools Request object. For the url value, set it to the name of  the HTML document that you uploaded to your server. We will use the onSuccess  Request class method to watch for the eventuality that our Ajax request was  successful. Upon success, we alert the date that the HTML document was last  modified by getting the value of the Last-Modified HTTP header using the  getHeader method. Finally, we use the send   method to initiate the Ajax request.  [ 184 ]                                                                        Chapter 7    window.addEvent 'domready', function  {    var ajaxRequest = new Request {          Make the request to the same page       url: 'e05_getting_headers.html',          When the server response is completed       onSuccess: function  {             Display the last time the document was modified          alert this.getHeader 'Last-Modified'  ;       }    } .send  ; } ;    3.	 Test your work in a web browser. Upon the success of your Ajax Request,   you should see the something like the following dialog box.  What just happened? In the previous example, we learned how we can get information about a web page that  we've requested. More specifically, we looked into an HTTP header called Last-Modified  to see when the web page was last modified.  [ 185 ]                                                                        Going 2.0 with Ajax  Have a go hero – get the content length of the requested page Did you know that you can determine the content length of a requested document? To do  so, you can see what the value of the Content-Length HTTP header is. This gives you the  size in terms of 8-bit bytes.  Modify the previous example to alert the Content-Length value instead of the  Last-Modified value, and see how big our HTML document is.  Summary  Specifically, we covered:  Congratulations, you're now a professional Ajax developer! We covered plenty of things in  this chapter.    Creating a Request object: We learned how to create an Ajax Request object in  MooTools, as well as the options and methods available to us for working with  Request objects.    Requesting data: We discovered how to request data from the web server. In the   process we explored the Request.HTML and Request.JSON classes, which make  working with HTML and JSON data a breeze.    Sending data: With the help of PHP, we witnessed just how powerful Ajax is by   sending data to a server-side script that processed our data and sent it back to us,  asynchronously. This allowed us to create an uninterrupted user experience that  instantly updated the web page upon a user event.    Setting and getting HTTP headers: We learned that HTTP requests and responses  have attached meta information that tell us about the server and the data we're  requesting. They're called HTTP headers and we used MooTools methods in the  Request class to get and set this information.  Now that we've learned about the classes, methods, and functions we can use for working  with Ajax, we're ready to extend MooTools' core functionalities with plugins; that's the topic  of the next chapter.  [ 186 ]                                                                        8  Beefing Up MooTools: Using the  MooTools More Plugins  The MooTools project offers highly useful additional classes that extend the  MooTools Core library, officially called MooTools More. These classes are often  referred to as plugins because you can simply plug them into your web pages to  extend the MooTools Core library. You'll find a diverse set of plugins that do a wide variety of tasks, from adding  simple text hints on web form input fields, to permitting drag--and-drop  functionality to be used in web games. Plugins are, in essence, MooTools classes written by either MooTools core  developers and or members of the MooTools community. They utilize the  MooTools API to either extend functionalities of existing Core classes, or create  an entirely new class utilizing Core functions and methods. Although there are many third-party plugins out there that are equally  awesome when compared to the More plugins, we'll limit our discussion  specifically to official MooTools plugins.  In this chapter we shall:    Learn how to obtain and install MooTools More plugins   Learn how to make a slick Accordion area to display content in an engaging    and compact manner using the Fx.Accordion plugin    Make more user-friendly forms using the OverText plugin   Create a simple web game, to make things fun, using the Drag and    Drag. Move plugin                                                                        Beefing Up MooTools: Using the More Plugins  Downloading MooTools More plugins  MooTools More plugins can be found on the official MooTools website. To see the available  plugins, go to the More Builder section of the site, located at the following web address:  http:  mootools.net more  The More Builder is a web tool for downloading a customized library containing your  plugins of interest. You can select the plugins you'd like to acquire, and the More Builder  will automatically include any other plugins and JavaScript libraries that are required   dependencies  in order for the selected plugins to work.  Time for action – downloading the Fx.Accordion plugin Let us see how the MooTools More Builder works by downloading an Fx plugin called  Fx.Accordion.  1.   In your web browser, navigate to the More section in the MooTools official site.  The web address is: http:  mootools.net more.  2.

We learned how to download a MooTools More plugin using the More Builder. You should  have noted that when selecting a plugin to download, the other plugins are automatically  checked for you; these are other plugins that are required in order for the selected plugins   to work.  Installing MooTools plugins  Using a MooTools plugin is as simple as referencing it in the HTML document. However,  important considerations must be made to make sure that they are included in the correct  order in your HTML documents. More specifically, the order should be:  1.  MooTools Core Library 2.  MooTools More Library 3.  Your MooTools script  Time for action – installing Fx.Accordion Before we proceed any further in our exploration of MooTools plugins, we should first learn  how to install them in our HTML documents.  1.  To start, create an HTML document and reference the MooTools Core library's   location in the   section. Make sure that the file path in the src attribute  is pointing to the correct location.      <  script>     …      2.	 Next, include the More library that you downloaded earlier, right beneath the   Core library.           [ 190 ]                                                                        Chapter 8           …      3.  Finally, create another   tag pair where you will insert your own MooTools   code, right below the inclusion of the More library.     <script type="text javascript" src="http:  ajax.googleapis.com  ajax libs mootools 1.2.2 mootools-yui-compressed.js">         window.addEvent 'domready', function  {       MooTools script goes in here } ;             Now, we are ready to move on and utilize MooTools plugins.  What just happened? You learned the correct way of installing a MooTools plugin in an HTML document.  We learned that the order of   tags in our document is essential for the plugins  to work properly.  Now that we know how to download and install MooTools plugins, it's time to see some  plugins in action.  [ 191 ]                                                                        Beefing Up MooTools: Using the More Plugins  Discovering a handful of MooTools More plugins  There are—at the time of this writing—over 40 MooTools plugins available on the MooTools  site, and there's no indication that this collection will stop growing as more and more  developers contribute their own work to share to their fellow coders. Though we won't get  to use all of the plugins in the More collection, we will certainly see a handful of them in  action in this chapter.  By using a few plugins, I hope that you see just how great More plugins are, how they uphold  the MooTools way of reducing the amount of code you have to write, and that I prompt you  to explore other More plugins to enhance your JavaScripts.  To find full documentation of each MooTools More plugin, check out the official MooTools  More docs pages at: http:  mootools.net docs more  We'll start with a plugin we already have in hand, Fx. Accordion.  Creating engaging content using Fx.Accordion Fx.Accordion is a class for making a group of elements, whose visibility is toggled, by clicking  on a trigger. Clicking on a trigger expands or collapses the target element in a smooth and  animated manner.  Time for action – creating an accordion Accordions are great for displaying a large amount of content in a compact manner, as well  as establishing an engaging experience by allowing users to interact with your content. In  this example, we're going to create an accordion area that displays information about a  hypothetical development firm. We'll have accordion sections for work, services, clients,   and contact.  1.  First things first: solid HTML. We have to make sure that our accordion has  good markup so that when JavaScript and CSS are disabled, users can still  access content. We contain our accordion inside a div that's intuitively called  accordion. Then we have h2 div pairs for each section. The h2s will serve as  the trigger for expanding a section later on; we give then a class of trigger.  The content of each section is inside divs with a class of section.

Next, we'll use some CSS to make our accordion a bit more pleasing to the eye.   Read the comments in the following CSS code block to take note of some  style rules.    * Reset margin and padding of all elements to 0 *  * {  margin:0;  padding:0; } body {  background:ccc;  font:12px Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;  color:333; } accordion {  background:fff;  border:1px solid 999;  width:640px;  margin-left:5px; }  * Change mouse pointer to pointer when hovering over trigger *  .trigger {  height:30px;  line-height:30px;  display:block;  letter-spacing:10px;  background: 333;  border-bottom:2px solid ccc;  color:fff;  margin:0;  cursor:pointer; } h1, p, img { margin:5px; } img { float:left; }    [ 194 ]                                                                        Chapter 8  3.  Next, we'll include the Fx.Accordion library that we downloaded earlier in the  chapter. Remember the importance of the order of including our libraries and  scripts: MooTools Core library first, then MooTools More, and finally, our own scripts.         window.addEvent 'domready', function  {  [ 195 ]                                                                        Beefing Up MooTools: Using the More Plugins       Script goes here } ;    4.  Finally, we instantiate our accordion. We create a new object called accordion.  We feed it with three arguments: the elements that will trigger the expanding and  collapsing of the sections  .trigger , the sections that will be hidden and shown   .section , and finally, the container of our accordion  accordion . Then  we set a few option values: alwaysHide is set to true to permit us to collapse  all sections  by default, the plugin forces at least one section to be shown , and  trigger set to 'mouseover' which lets us expand and collapse each section when  the user mouses over the .trigger elements  by default, the value is 'click' . window.addEvent 'domready', function  {    var accordion = new Accordion '.trigger', '.section',                                    $ 'accordion' , {       alwaysHide: true,       trigger: 'mouseover'    } ; } ;  5.  Test your work in a web browser. On initial page load, you should see   an animated transition as the first section is displayed. Then, when  you hover over other section titles  like Clients, for example , the first  section should collapse, and the new section should expand.  [ 196 ]                                                                        Chapter 8  [ 197 ]                                                                        Beefing Up MooTools: Using the More Plugins  What just happened? In the previous example, we created a simple accordion using the Fx.Accordion MooTools  More plugin. We instantiated an object called accordion using the Accordion class and  pointed to our accordion by feeding it the value of the trigger class  '.trigger' , the  sections that will be expanded and collapsed  '.section' , and the container of our  Accordion elements  $ 'accordion'  .  Just like with most MooTools classes, the format for instantiating a MooTools Accordion  object is as follows:  var objectName = new Accordion 'trigger', 'sections', 'container' ;  Fx.Accordion options Before moving onto another MooTools more plugin, let's go over some options available  in the Fx.Accordion plugin.

Sets a fixed height for all sections. Sets a fixed width for all sections. By default, there is an animated  transition when expanding and  collapsing sections; set this to false if  you don't want any animations.

The Date plugin extends the native Date object  with a host of useful functions and methods for dealing with date inputs.  Let's explore some of these functions.  Time for action – building a Date calculator tool Let's witness the power of the Date plugin by building a pure client-side web tool that adds  or subtracts values based on the current date. The tool will allow users to enter how many  days, months, or years to add or subtract to the current date. This can be helpful for getting  the exact date of past events. Note that this calculator doesn't do input validation, and thus,  if you were to use it, you would have to modify it so that it validates the user's input. In  particular, if the user inputs an invalid value to add or subtract to the current date, such as  'apple' instead of a number, the script will break.  [ 201 ]                                                                        Beefing Up MooTools: Using the More Plugins  1.  We'll start by setting up the HTML. The first key element is a paragraph that will  show the current date. We will have three form fields to allow users to set the  options for the calculation. The first form field is a   element  drop-down  menu  that will determine what operation we will use: either Add or Subtract.  The second form field is an input text element, which will take a numerical whole  number as a valid value  if the user enters something else, our script will break . The  third form field is another   element that will determine whether we're  adding subtracting days, months, or years. Lastly, we have a paragraph element  called new-date that will show the resultant date after we run our script.    Date Calculator      Current date:               Subtract                 <input id="calculate" name="calculate" type="button"             value="Calculate"  >     &nbsp;      Days   Months   Years    Add   [ 202 ]                                                                        Chapter 8  2.  Next, make sure that you have the MooTools libraries and your script set   up correctly.           window.addEvent 'domready', function  {       Script goes here } ;    3.  First, we will initiate a date object—aptly named date—that will hold the current   date  which it takes from the computer's date and time settings . Once this is  done, we can run methods onto the object, such as date.get 'year' .       Initiate date object    var date = new Date  ;  [ 203 ]                                                                        Beefing Up MooTools: Using the More Plugins  4.  Next, we will build a string that will hold today's date to output on the web page.   The text format of the date is month day year  that is, February 18, 2009 is   2 18 2009 ; we put this string inside a variable called currentDateDisplay. The  Date plugin extends the Core library in such a way that we can use the get  method to determine the month  .get 'mo'  , day  .get 'date'  , and year   .get 'year'   of a date instance. We then use the appendText method to  append the current-date paragraph element with the string value inside  currentDateDisplay.       Build current date as a string to display in web page       Format: mm dd yyyy    var currentDateDisplay =       date.get 'mo' +' '+date.get 'date' +' '+date.get 'year' ;       Append current-date paragraph with currentDateDisplay    $ 'current-date' .appendText currentDateDisplay ;  5.  The next step is pretty straightforward; we add a click event listener on the   Calculate button.    $ 'calculate' .addEvent 'click', function  {          Calculation happens in here     } ;  [ 204 ]                                                                        Chapter 8  6.  The first part of calculating the new date is to get the values from the form fields.   To make our code cleaner and easier to maintain, we place these values into  variables. To determine which option is selected in the   elements, we  use a handy MooTools method called getSelected  . To get the text input field  value, we can simply use the trusty get method with 'value' as the argument.          Get values and place in variables       var operationSelected = $ 'operation' .getSelected  ;       var numberValue = $ 'number' .get 'value' ;       var intervalSelected = $ 'interval' .getSelected  ;  7.  The next chunk of code is the meat of our programming logic. We get  the value of the selected option using the getProperty method with  'value' as the argument. If the value is 'add', then we use the increment  method, otherwise, we use the decrement method. Both methods are  part of the Date plugin, which takes two arguments: the interval  'month,  'day', 'year', 'seconds'  you would like to add  or subtract  and the how  many  in integers  to add  or subtract . For the interval, we use the value  of the option selected in the   element. And  for the how many part, we get the value entered in the number text  input field  which we earlier placed inside a variable called numberValue .  We place the calculated date inside a date object called newDate.        If value of $ 'operation'  is 'add', use increment method...       if operationSelected.getProperty 'value' =='add' {          var newDate =              date.increment intervalSelected.getProperty 'value' ,              numberValue ;          otherwise use decrement method       } else{          var newDate =              date.decrement intervalSelected.getProperty 'value' ,              numberValue ;       }  8.  The final process we need to perform is to produce the calculated date   inside the   element. First, we build the new  date as a string, placing the value inside newDateDisplay. Then we  use the set method to set the HTML inside the   element.          Build new date as a strong to display in web page       var newDateDisplay =           newDate.get 'mo' +' '+newDate.get 'date' +' '+          newDate.get 'year' ;          Set new-date paragraph's HTML with newDateDisplay  [ 205 ]                                                                        Beefing Up MooTools: Using the More Plugins        $ 'new-date' .set 'html', ' Result:            '+newDateDisplay ;   9.

We created a simple web tool for calculating past and future dates, based on the current  date. More specifically, we allow users to select whether they want to add or subtract from  the current date, enter a numerical integer, and then also ask whether they'd like to add or  subtract days, months, or years. The script we wrote used the Date plugin and some of its  useful utility functions and methods to make this whole script possible in fewer than 20 lines  of code.

Making web forms more user-friendly with the OverText plugin MooTools More plugins range from very simple features to complicated features  such as input  validation in web forms . Overtext is in the simple range. What it does is it shows text in an  input field  which can be used to prompt the user on what to enter , and when they focus on  the input field, the text disappears so that they can proceed with entering their text.  Let's explore this plugin by way of an example.  Time for action – creating a web form that uses OverText OverText is great for providing contextual hints about an input field. For example, an input  field that takes a birth date could suggest the proper date format, or a password text field  could give the user a reminder to use a strong and memorable password. In some instances,  you may even consider replacing input labels with OverText to save some space. In this  simple web form example, we'll use OverText for input fields.   1.  Let us create the HTML web form. We have three input fields with IDs of name,  email, and dateofbirth. They also have corresponding labels for semantics  and web accessibility. The most important thing to note is that our input  elements have alt properties: the value of its alt property will be the  text that will be shown as an over text.    Web Form with OverText             Name:                      Email:    [ 208 ]                                                                        Chapter 8                     Date of Birth:                  2.  Let's give the form some basic styles. The most important style rule to note is the   span: our over text will be span elements.   label {    width:100px;    display:block;    float:left; } input { width:200px; }  * A few style rules for the OverText text*  span {    color:999;    width:300px;    font:12px Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; }    [ 209 ]                                                                        Beefing Up MooTools: Using the More Plugins  3.  Time to write our OverText script. We use the each method to cycle through each   input field. For each iteration, we create a new OverText class instance with  the first argument set to the ID of the input element  which we determine via   the get method . We set the element option of the class instance to span   by default, they are labels .   window.addEvent 'domready', function  {    $$ 'input' .each function el {       new OverText el.get 'id' , {          element: 'span'       } ;    } ; } ;    4.  That's it! Now, test the script in a web browser. You should see the over text  as gray text equal to the value of the alt properties of each input element.  When you click on an input to start typing, the over text disappears.  [ 210 ]                                                                        Chapter 8  What just happened? In the previous example, we used the OverText plugin to make a web form more usable by  giving contextual hints to users while filling out the form. For example, for the Date of Birth  input field, we suggested the correct date format to enter.  [ 211 ]                                                                        Beefing Up MooTools: Using the More Plugins  Drag-and-drop with Drag and Drag.Move The last two plugins we'll explore in this chapter are the Drag and Drag.Move plugins. The  Drag plugin extends the MooTools Core library to enable draggable elements; elements that,  when clicked on with the mouse, can be moved around the web page. The Drag.Move plugin  is an extension of the Drag plugin and is a subclass that opens up even more functions and  methods for working with drag and drop content.  Important note on web accessibility Though the drag-and-drop interaction pattern is becoming more and more  popular, you should ensure that web pages that use this type of interactivity  degrade correctly. Specifically, you should make sure that users who have  vision impairments—and thus cannot see where to click and drag to, and  mobility impairments—and thus, cannot move conventional input devices  such as a mouse—are still able to access important information and perform  critical site tasks.  We will learn about these two plugins by creating a simple web game.  Time for action – creating a simple drag-and-drop game We're going to create a web game that will utilize the Drag and Drag.Move plugins. There will  be a small gray box that you can drag around the web page  called a draggable . There will  also be a larger box to drag to  called a droppable . When the draggable is dropped inside  the droppable, you get 1 point.  1.  First, we will set up the HTML. We contain the draggable and droppable   elements inside a div called drag-container. The draggable element will  have an ID of draggable and the droppable element will have an ID of  dropbox. Finally, we have a section for placing the user's score called log.    Drag and Drop    Instructions : drag the smaller gray box inside  the larger box. You get 1 point for each successful drop.       &nbsp;     Drag stuff here.     &nbsp;     [ 212 ]                                                                        Chapter 8  2.  As you can see in the previous figure, we need some CSS styles to make our web   game visually relevant. Let's discuss the important styles. For drag-container,  we need to explicitly declare the position attribute as relative, or else dragging  will not function in Internet Explorer. For the draggable element, we need to  explicitly declare a position property set to absolute, even though the plugin  automatically does this for us via DOM manipulation  also for IE . We also set a  z-index property to 1—a higher value than dropbox—so that it always appears  on top of the latter. Finally, .start-drag is a class that we will apply via JavaScript  to draggable once the dragging has started; it will be a visual indication that  shows when the element has been dragged, and when it has been dropped. body { font:10px Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; } drag-container {    height:250px;    width:250px;    border:1px solid 999;      * Needed for Internet Explorer *      position:relative; } draggable {    background-color:ccc;    width:60px;    height:60px;    text-align:center;     * Needed for Internet Explorer *   [ 213 ]                                                                        Beefing Up MooTools: Using the More Plugins      position:absolute;    top:0;     left:0;     * Keep draggable on top of dropbox *     z-index:1; } dropbox {    border:2px solid 999;    text-align:center;    width:100px;    height:100px;    position:absolute;    top:75px;     left:75px;     * Keep dropbox below draggable *      z-index:0; }  * Class to apply when dragging starts *  .start-drag {    background-color:000;    border:2px solid 000; } log { font-size:18px; }  [ 214 ]                                                                        Chapter 8  3.   In the previous screenshot, you can see our web game taking shape. The structure  and styles are in; now all there is left to do is make it functional. To start, we  will initiate a variable that will hold the user's score  called successCount .   $ window .addEvent 'domready', function  {       Counts successful drops    var successCount = 0; } ;    4.  Next, we set up the structure of our Drag.Move instance. We call the instance   dragEl, and pass as an argument $ 'draggable'  to indicate the target  element to make draggable.       Create Drag.Move class instance    var dragEl = new Drag.Move $ 'draggable' ,{          Options, methods, event listeners go here    } ;  5.  Next, we set the droppables option to $ 'dropbox' , to indicate that the   dropbox div is a droppable area.    var dragEl = new Drag.Move $ 'draggable' ,{          Indicates elements considered as drop areas       droppables: $ 'dropbox' ,          Rest of the stuff will go here...    } ;  6.  Drag has a special event option called onStart that watches out for the event that  the dragging has started  that is, the user clicks and holds down the mouse button   on the draggable element . We use the set method to DOM insert the text   Start drag... inside it, and the addClass method to assign the element  the .start-drag class.    var dragEl = new Drag.Move $ 'draggable' ,{          Indicates elements considered as drop areas       droppables: $ 'dropbox' ,          Event listener for when dragging starts       onStart: function el {          el.set 'html',' Start drag... '           .addClass 'start-drag' ;       },          Rest of the stuff goes here...    } ;  [ 215 ]                                                                        Beefing Up MooTools: Using the More Plugins  7.  There's an event option just for the Drag.Move class called onEnter, which   can run a function when the draggable element comes in contact with  the droppable element. When this event occurs, we use the highlight  method  from Fx.Tween  to make dropbox flash red  hexidecimal value  of ff0000 , indicating that the element has entered the area.       Create Drag.Move class instance    var dragEl = new Drag.Move $ 'draggable' ,{          Indicates elements considered as drop areas       droppables: $ 'dropbox' ,          Event listener for when dragging starts       onStart: function el {          el.set 'html',' Start drag... '           .addClass 'start-drag' ;       },          Event listenter for when draggable object          enters a droppable area.       onEnter: function el, dropbox {             Highlight the droppable area entered          dropbox.highlight 'ff0000' ;       },          Rest of the stuff goes here...    } ;  8.  The final option we will set for our Drag.Move instance  and the most verbose  one  is the onDrop option, which runs a function when the draggable element  is dropped inside the droppable element. The function after the onDrop option  uses two arguments. The first argument  el  refers to the element being dragged.  The second argument  dropArea  will contain the DOM element that the el  has been dropped upon; if the value of this argument is null, it means it was  not dropped in a droppable element. We set up a control structure  if else   to check the value of dropArea. If it is not null, then we increment our score  tracker  successCount  by 1 to indicate that the user successfully gained 1  point. We also update the log div with the new score. And then we set the  HTML inside el to say "Dropped in dropbox" to add a visual queue that the  drop was a success, as well as remove the .start-drag class because we're  no longer dragging. Otherwise, if dropArea is null, then we set the HTML  of el to say "Not in dropbox." and still remove the .start-drag class.    var dragEl = new Drag.Move $ 'draggable' ,{          Indicates elements considered as drop areas       droppables: $ 'dropbox' ,          Event listener for when dragging starts       onStart: function el {  [ 216 ]                                                                        Chapter 8           el.set 'html',' Start drag... '           .addClass 'start-drag' ;       },          Event listenter for when draggable object          enters a droppable area.       onEnter: function el, dropbox {             Highlight the droppable area entered          dropbox.highlight 'ff0000' ;       },          Event listener for when draggable is dropped       onDrop: function el, dropArea {             Second argument is null if             draggable is not dropped in a droppable          if dropArea!=null {                Increment variable by 1             successCount++;                Update log div with new successCount value             $ 'log' .set 'html',' Successful drops: ' +                successCount + ' ' ;                Update draggable HTML to indicate it was dropped                inside a droppable            el.set 'html',' Dropped in dropbox.

We created a very simple web game that allows users to drag-and-drop an element into  another element. When they successfully drop the draggable element inside the droppable  element, they get a score of one. This was accomplished using the Drag and Drag.Move  MooTools More plugin.  Summary  In this chapter we learned about MooTools More plugins:    What MooTools More plugins are: We determined that they're useful classes    that can be used to extend the MooTools Core library.    Downloading and installing MooTools More plugins: We learned that the More   Builder in the official MooTools site is where we obtain More plugins and that we  can customize our download so that only the plugins we want will be included.    Discovering some More plugins: We discovered four out of the 40+ More plugins    to see just how useful More plugins are. We used Fx.Accordion to create a slick   and interactive content area, OverText to make web forms more user-friendly,   and Drag Drag.Move to create a simple web game.  Now that we've learned about MooTools More plugins, how about we create our own  MooTools plugins? That's the topic of the next chapter.  [ 220 ]                                                                        9  Creating Your Own Plugin  Authoring your own plugin is a great practice for creating flexible, extensible,  and reusable scripts. Plugins are inline with the MooTools philosophy of writing  reusable code that you can instantiate and customize. For example, if you build  many websites and find that there are certain JavaScript functionalities that  you reuse and tweak for each project, you can simply write a class for it and  instantiate them with varying options in your projects. You can also release plugins to the public, and, thus, participate and help your  fellow MooTools developers. This can be an added advantage to your curriculum  vitae; it can showcase your abilities in writing MooTools code, the right way.  In this chapter we shall:    Design a plugin by making a design sheet   Create a script that accomplishes the function of the plugin; it will serve as a pattern  and as a lesson on converting your existing scripts into a reusable and flexible plugin    Create documentation for the plugin and preparing it for public release  Let's get started, shall we?                                                                        Creating Your Own Plugin  Why create a plugin?  As I mentioned in the preceding chapter, plugins are flexible classes that you can reuse and  share, whether you have an existing script that you want to reuse several times in multiple  projects, or have an idea of a useful script that you'll know will be used over and over again.  It's a good idea to write a class that you can instantiate and provide customizable options for.  In this chapter, we're going to create a simple auto image captioning plugin. We'll start from  the design conceptualization phase of the plugin, all the way up to documenting our code  and preparing it for public release. We're going to follow MooTools coding standards  which  you can learn about by simply downloading a MooTools More plugin and studying the code  and comments .  Designing the plugin  With a little forethought, we can effectively build a flexible class. We have to think of what  the plugin is meant to do  and what it isn't meant to do , what options will be helpful, and  the basic logic of how the plugin will work.  Often, it is helpful to invest some time in writing down necessary information about a   plugin you're about to write. Your notes can be the blueprint of what you're building,   and also serve as a great way to conceptualize the code logic of the plugin. I call this  document a design sheet.  This design sheet can also help greatly when we finalize our code's documentation, and for  preparation of the plugin for public release. The design sheet can change; you may realize  that there are more options that you need in order to make the plugin truly customizable,  and there may be options that you thought would be good to have, but would just be overkill  in the final product.  Before we begin any writing, we're going to design our plugin, so grab your favorite  notebook or word-processing software and get ready to do some writing.  [ 222 ]                                                                        Time for action – creating a design sheet for our plugin We are going to create a design sheet for the auto image captioning plugin that we're going  to build. The format that you should use for this design sheet should be one that you and or  your team is comfortable with. In this example, I will show you how to create a design sheet  arranged as a table: you can do this by depicting it in a notebook, or on a word-processing  application  such as Microsoft Word or OpenOffice .  Chapter 9  1.  Create the headings of the design sheet: Plugin name, What will it do,   How will it do it, and Plugin Options.  Plugin name  What will it do  How will it do it  Plugin Options  2.	 Write in the plugin name. The plugin name must be capitalized. MooTools best  practices for naming a class is by camelcasing words of the class name, that is,  where each elements initial letter is capitalized. When coming up with a class  name, make sure that it's as intuitive as possible and outlines what it does. Since  we're creating an image auto captioning plugin, the name is ImageCaption.  Plugin name ImageCaption  What will it do  How will it do it  Plugin Options  3.	 Next, we should define what the intent of the plugin is. This will help us   conceptualize the code we will have to write and find options we might want  to provide the user for customizing the class instance, as well as uncover some  potential pitfalls when writing our script. In this case, the plugin will take the alt  property of the image and place it as HTML text below it. If the alt property is not  present, it will try to check if the title property is present. Now we can see the  first potential pitfall of our script: what if both alt and title properties weren't  available? We should have a backup plan for this situation. Our backup plan is  that the caption text will equal to an empty string  '' . We don't have to write  all this down, we just want a basic one to two sentence definition of our plugin   which you'll see in action later in the chapter when we document our code .  Plugin name ImageCaption  How will it do it  Plugin Options  What will it do ImageCaption will  take the alt property   or title property  of  an image, and insert it  as HTML text to serve  as a photo caption  its  description .

For this to work, we will iterate through all  the images in a web page, take each image's alt property and store it in a variable,  wrap the image in another element that will contain both the image and the caption,  and then inject the caption text in it, right below the image, as a   element. By writing down the code logic, we've discovered a couple of things. First, what  if the user doesn't want all images in a web page to be captioned? This means  we should have a plugin option for specifying which images should be captioned.  Second, what if the user wanted the image caption to be above instead of below the  image? We should also have a plugin option for the position of the caption text. By  writing this down, we're able to flesh out two options for the final column.  Plugin name ImageCaption  Plugin Options  What will it do ImageCaption will  take the alt property   or title property  of  an image, and insert it  as HTML text to serve  as a photo caption  its  description .  How will it do it We will take the  alt  or title   property value  of the target  images in a web  page, wrap that  image in another  element that will  contain the image  and the caption  text, and then  inject the caption  text into the  DOM, above or  below the image,  as a    element.  5.	  In the last column, we should determine options we'd like to provide to the user.  This list should be flexible: while writing the plugin, you might realize there are   more options that we should provide, or that some options that you initially   thought were great, aren't really that useful or can't be made available due to   the way the script was written.  We should allow the user to specify the class name to the wrapper of the image  caption pair so that they may be able to style these elements using CSS. Next, we  should allow users to change the element type of the wrapper  by default, both  will be   elements . Finally, users should be able to position the caption  text above the image. To make this easier, we'll follow the format: option name  -  datatype, defaults to default value  description. This format is consistent with  MooTools docs and will help us later on when we document our plugin.

Chapter 9  How will it do it We will take the  alt  or title   property value  of the target  images in a web  page, wrap that  image in another  element that will  contain the image  and the caption  text, and then  inject the caption  text into the  DOM, above or  below the image,  as a    element.  Plugin Options wrapperClass -  string, defaults  to 'imgWrapper'  the class  name of the wrapper element.  wrapperType -  string, defaults  to 'span'  the element type of  the wrapper.  captionType -  string, defaults  to 'span'  the element type of  the caption text.  captionPosition -  string,  defaults to 'after'  where the  caption text element will be  injected to the DOM relative  to the image.  What just happened? In the previous example, we constructed a design sheet for our plugin in order to give us  a better understanding of what we will be coding. In addition, it will serve as a guide  or  "blueprint"  of our plugin while we write it, and later on, when we document our code, we  can take parts of it.  Now that we've got a good understanding of what we'll be doing, it's time to start coding.  Creating the ImageCaption script  Oftentimes, you will already have a script lying around that you wish to convert to a plugin  because you found yourself using it repeatedly in your projects. For beginner MooTools  developers, it may be helpful to first get the functionality working, and then convert it to a  flexible plugin, thus using the script as a pattern.  To begin, we'll focus on scripting the image caption function. This will also help you  understand how the code works to make it easier to transition it into a MooTools plugin.  [ 225 ]                                                                        Creating Your Own Plugin  Time for action – writing the ImageCaption script Before we start writing our MooTools plugin, we'll take an additional step; we're going  to write a functional script that accomplishes the task we've set out to do, which is to  automatically caption images in a web page using their alt  or title  property. Imagine  auto-captioning 20 images  or more  in a web page without having to do much other work  than assigning them an alt or title property? This reduces the amount of HTML we have  to write, which in turn, reduces HTML clutter and file size.  1.  Start with some HTML by putting images in a web page. In this web page, place   three image elements  encapsulating these image elements inside a p tag is  optional . For the first image, include an alt property value pair. For the second  image, do not provide any alt or title property value pairs. This will serve as  a test case on how our script will work without an image caption. The third one   will have a title property instead of an alt property.  ImageCaption Script   <img src="lake_mead.jpg" width="300" height="201" alt="Lake  mead in a speeding car."  >       <img src="red_rocks.jpg" width="300" height="201" title="A  photo of Red Rock Mountain near Las Vegas, Nevada."  >     [ 226 ]                                                                        Chapter 9  2.  Next, we write our MooTools script. We will iterate through each img element,   adding a caption for each of them. We do this by using the each method.   window.addEvent 'domready', function  { $$ 'img' .each function image {      code to execute goes here } ; } ;    3.  The first action is to get the caption text value and the width of the image. We get  the alt property value by using the getProperty method, and place it inside a  variable called captionText. Since we have to take into account that the alt property  may not be present because the user does not have it assigned to the image  and  thus, using the getProperty method will return null , we use the  operator. Here's how it works: the value to the left of the  will take precedence over the  value on its right. If the value on the left is null, then it will try the value on its  right. You can have as many  operators as you would like and if the last value is  still null, then the variable will be assigned a null value.  Therefore, the last value should avoid returning null  unless you want it to  and is  the "back up" plan.  In this instance, if there are no title or alt properties, then we use an empty  string  ''  as our caption text; this will prevent our script from malfunctioning  because captionText will never be equal to null.  $$ 'img' .each function image {    var captionText = image.getProperty 'alt'   image. getProperty 'title'   ''; } ;  4.  Next, we should get the width of the image so that we can set its wrapper   element equal to it; this makes it so that our wrapper is not too wide, which will  affect the position of the image caption. Again, we utilize the getProperty  method to do this. Because the getProperty method returns a string value,  we can use the toInt   method to convert it to an integer data type. Like with  captionText, we want to avoid a null value  which will happen when the  user does not include a width property on the img element . Therefore, we  use the  operator to conditionally assign width a string value of 'auto'. $$ 'img' .each function image {    var captionText = image.getProperty 'alt'   image. getProperty 'title'   '';  [ 227 ]                                                                        Creating Your Own Plugin     var width = image.getProperty 'width' .toInt    'auto'; } ;  5.  Now, it's time to construct the wrapper element. We use the Element constructor   with an argument of string value of span to denote that our wrapper element  will be a   element. We use the class option to define the value of the  wrapper's CSS class—imageCaption. We use the styles option to set required  CSS styles onto the wrapper element: it has to be a block element so that we  can float the image caption set if we choose to. We also need to set the width  CSS property to either the width property of the image defined by the user,  or to auto, this is where the width variable earlier on comes into play. We  call this element wrapper and we will be referencing it later in the script. $$ 'img' .each function image {    var captionText = image.getProperty 'alt'   image. getProperty 'title'   '';    var width = image.getProperty 'width' .toInt    'auto';     var wrapper = new Element 'span', {       'class': 'imgCaption',       'styles': {          'display': 'block',          'width': width       }    } ;  } ;  6.  Next, we create the caption text element, again, using the Element constructor,  named caption. caption will be a   element. To set the text inside the    , we use the html option with the value of captionText that we took  earlier from the alt  or title  property. Finally, we use the styles option to set  the basic CSS styles of the element; it has to be a block element so that it displays  below the img element, and so that we may make adjustments to it easily. $$ 'img' .each function image {    var captionText = image.getProperty 'alt'   image. getProperty 'title'   '&nbsp;';    var width = image.getProperty 'width' .toInt    'auto';     var wrapper = new Element 'span', {       'class': 'imgwrapper',       'styles': {          'display': 'block',  [ 228 ]                                                                        Chapter 9  7.  Now we have to modify the DOM to wrap the img element with the wrapper   element as well as inject the caption element after the image. This only takes up  two lines of code. We use the wraps method to wrap the image with the wrapper.  We then use the inject method to insert the caption element after image. window.addEvent 'domready'’, function  { $$ 'img' .each function image {    var captionText = image.getProperty 'alt'          image.getProperty 'title'   '&nbsp;';    var width = image.getProperty 'width' .toInt    'auto';           'width': width       }    } ;     var caption = new Element 'span', {       'html': captionText,       'styles': {          'display': 'block',          'width': width       }    } ; } ;     var wrapper = new Element 'span', {       'class': 'imgwrapper',       'styles': {          'display': 'block',          'width': width       }    } ;     var caption = new Element 'span', {       'html': captionText,       'styles': {          'display': 'block',          'width': width       }    } ;    wrapper.wraps image ;    caption.inject image,'after' ; } ; } ;    [ 229 ]                                                                        Creating Your Own Plugin  8.  Test your work in your web browser. You should see that our first and  third images have text captions, but the second one will not  because  we didn't set an alt or title property on that img element .  [ 230 ]                                                                        9.  We can stop there and call it a day, but our image captions don't look very pleasing   Chapter 9  to the eyes. We'll use CSS to style our captions. Here, it is important to note a   crucial concept: separating functionality from style. By not using JavaScript to limit   our CSS styles, we give our script a lot more flexibility in its design. We only set the   display CSS property and width property because they are necessary, the rest is in   the hands of the developer designer. The following are the CSS styles used here,   but you should take the liberty to get the style and layout you wish your image   captions to have.  * Styles for the wrapper *  .imageCaption {    background-color:e1e1e1;    border:1px solid ccc;    padding:5px;    text-align:center;    float:left;    margin:0 10px 5px 0; }  * Styles for the image *  .imageCaption img {    border:1px thin fff; }  * Styles for caption text *  .imageCaption span {    font:italic 12px Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif;    color:333;    letter-spacing:-1px;    margin-top:5px; }  * Web page styles not related to image captions *  body {    font:normal 11px 20px Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;    color:363636; } h1 {    font:30px Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif;    letter-spacing:-1px;    color:930; } p {    margin:10px 0; }  [ 231 ]                                                                        Creating Your Own Plugin  10.  To get the full effect of how the image captions work, dummy text was also inserted.   Testing your work in a web browser should show you something similar to the   following screenshot:  [ 232 ]                                                                        Chapter 9  What just happened? In the above example, we created a simple script that automatically captions the images in a  web page. This is the pattern that we will use in constructing our ImageCaption plugin. One  of the things we learned is that, in order to create flexible scripts, we must limit the amount  of CSS styles we use in the script and let the user determine the styles they would like for  their image caption.  Noting down pitfalls and places of improvement to the script In preparation for writing our plugin, the next step we should take is review our script to  find places where we can run into trouble, and places where we can improve flexibility   and customizability.  In reviewing the ImageCaption script we wrote, we noticed that we use the $$   to select  all the images on a web page. What if the user just wants a particular class of images to have  captions? We will have to address that issue when writing our plugin.  On the same token, we noticed that we use the   element for the wrapper and  caption text element, what if the user wanted to use a   element for the wrapper and    element for the caption text? That's another issue we'll resolve in our plugin.  Also, we can see that we're committed to using the imageCaption class for our figures, but  what if the user is already using that class for something else, or they would like to name it  something different to follow their coding conventions? We need our plugin to be able to  allow the user the option to set their class name s .  Finally, we can see that although the script works, we'd need to modify it heavily if we  wanted two types of image captions in a web page. For example, if we wanted one image  caption with a different background or floated to the left, we'd have to write a lot of  duplicate code to get that instance. Writing this script into a plugin allows us to instantiate  different variations of the plugin class that can have different classes.  Now that we know the places where we can improve our script and provide the user script's  more customizability options, it's time to start writing our plugin.  Converting the script to a flexible plugin  In this section, we will take the previous script and convert it into a MooTools plugin. We'll be  using, to the best of our abilities, MooTools More coding conventions and standards so that  MooTools developers using your plugin can easily read it and modify it  if needed .  The best way to learn MooTools coding conventions is by reading the Core library's code.  Perhaps a more pertinent method in this chapter is to read a MooTools More plugin's source  code by downloading an uncompressed version of it.  [ 233 ]                                                                        Creating Your Own Plugin  Additionally, you can take a look at the following web page in GitHub, which is where the  MooTools project is stored for Core developers:  Syntax and Coding Style Conventions on GitHub http:  wiki.github.com mootools mootools-core syntax- and-coding-style-conventions  Time for action – creating the ImageCaption plugin We'll now create our plugin.  1.  A plugin should be in its own JavaScript file. The file name, for best practice, must   be the same as the class name. Since our class name is ImageCaption, our  JavaScript file should be named ImageCaption.js. To start, create a new  JavaScript file and name it ImageCaption.js.  2.	 Next, let us set up the "template" for our class. A plugin will have three staples.   The first is Implements, which handles the Options. Because a  plugin is typically flexible and customizable , it will have an options  option. Finally, it will have the initialize option, which, if you can  remember, runs the code whenever our class is instantiated. var ImageCaption = new Class {    Implements: [Options],    options: {          Available options     },    initialize: function  {          Code to run whenever this class is instantiated.    } } ;  3.  We will start with the plugins options. Our plugin will have four options, as we've   defined in our design sheet earlier. wrapperClass is the class of the wrapper  element, wrapperType and captionType are the element types of the wrapper  and the caption elements. Finally, captionPosition allows the user to specify  where to insert the caption element relative to the img element. The values  assigned to each option are the default values that we also mentioned down in our   design sheet. They're all string data types. If the user specifies an option during class  instantiation, then our default options are overwritten and their specifications   take precedence over the default values.  [ 234 ]                                                                        Chapter 9  var ImageCaption = new Class {    Implements: [Options],    options: {       wrapperClass: 'imageCaption',       wrapperType: 'span',       captionType: 'span',       captionPosition: 'after'    },    initialize: function  {     } } ;  4.  Next, let us write the code which will be run when our plugin is instantiated.   Our plugin requires one argument from the user, the target image elements to be   captioned, which can use either the $$   or $   function to point to the  elements. It also requires the options argument so that it can set the options  of the class instance. var ImageCaption = new Class {    Implements: [Options],    options: {       wrapperClass: 'imageCaption',       wrapperType: 'span',       captionType: 'span',       captionPosition: 'after'    },    initialize: function images, options {          Code to run whenever this class is instantiated.    } } ;  5.  First, we need to set the options of the instance so that we can reference it  throughout our class. We use the setOptions method to do this, with the  options object as the argument. var ImageCaption = new Class {    Implements: [Options],    options: {       wrapperClass: 'imageCaption',       wrapperType: 'span',       captionType: 'span',       captionPosition: 'after'  [ 235 ]                                                                        Creating Your Own Plugin     },    initialize: function images, options {       this.setOptions options ;    } } ;  6.  The next phase is creating the code for captioning the target images. We  can do this in two ways: run it right in the initialize function or create  a class method to compartmentalize our class. We'll choose the latter  option by creating an ImageCaption method called addCaption. For  each target image, we call the addCaption method to add a caption to it   we use the each method to iterate through each target img element . var ImageCaption = new Class {    Implements: [Options],    options: {       wrapperClass: 'imageCaption',       wrapperType: 'span',       captionType: 'span',       captionPosition: 'after'    },    initialize: function images, options {       this.setOptions options ;       images.each function image {          this.addCaption image ;       }, this ;    },    addCaption: function image {          captioning code    } } ;  7.  Let's work on the addCaption method. Since we use the script we built  earlier in the chapter, this part should be a piece of cake. First, we get the  captionText and width value of the image, just like in the previous example.    addCaption: function image {       var captionText = image.getProperty captionProperty            image.getProperty 'title'   '&nbsp;';       var width = image.getProperty 'width' .toInt    'auto';    }  [ 236 ]                                                                        Chapter 9  8.  Then let's create the wrapper and caption elements. Instead of explicitly declaring  the values, we use the class options to set them; this way, we create a flexible class.       var wrapper = new Element this.options.wrapperType, {          'class': this.options.wrapperClass,          'styles': {             'display': 'block',             'width': width          }       } ;       var caption = new Element this.options.captionType, {          'html': captionText,          'styles': {             'display': 'block',             'width': width          }       } ;  9.  Finally, we perform our DOM manipulation, just like before.     addCaption: function image {       var captionText = image.getProperty captionProperty    image.getProperty 'title'   '&nbsp;';       var width = image.getProperty 'width' .toInt    'auto';       var wrapper = new Element this.options.wrapperType, {          'class': this.options.wrapperClass,          'styles': {             'display': 'block',             'width': width          }       } ;       var caption = new Element this.options.captionType, {          'html': captionText,          'styles': {             'display': 'block',             'width': width          }       } ;       wrapper.wraps image ;       caption.inject image, this.options.captionPosition ;    }  [ 237 ]                                                                        Creating Your Own Plugin  10.  Here is our entire plugin's code; review it to make sure you   understand how we converted our script into a plugin. var ImageCaption = new Class {    Implements: [Options],    options: {       wrapperClass: 'imageCaption',       wrapperType: 'span',       captionType: 'span',       captionPosition: 'after'    },    initialize: function images, options {       this.setOptions options ;       images.each function image {          this.addCaption image ;       }, this ;    },    addCaption: function image {       var captionText = image.getProperty captionProperty    image.getProperty 'title'   '&nbsp;';       var width = image.getProperty 'width' .toInt    'auto';       var wrapper = new Element this.options.wrapperType, {          'class': this.options.wrapperClass,          'styles': {             'display': 'block',             'width': width          }       } ;       var caption = new Element this.options.captionType, {          'html': captionText,          'styles': {             'display': 'block',             'width': width          }       } ;       wrapper.wraps image ;       caption.inject image, this.options.captionPosition ;    } } ;  [ 238 ]                                                                        What just happened? We converted the script that we built earlier into a flexible class  plugin  which we can reuse  and share with other MooTools developers.  In the next section, we shall test our plugin by instantiating it.  Chapter 9  Instantiating the plugin  Now that we have successfully converted our ImageCaption script into a plugin, it's time to  give it a test run.  Time for action – basic instantiation of the ImageCaption plugin We will see how our plugin works under various circumstances.  1.  Create an HTML document  or modify the example we used earlier .

In the   section of your HTML document, reference the MooTools Core  library and the ImageCaption plugin, and create a section where we will   instantiate our Caption class.         $ window .addEvent 'domready',function  {       Instantiate here. } ;    [ 239 ]                                                                        Creating Your Own Plugin  3.  Finally, let's instantiate our ImageCaption plugin. We do this by creating a class  object called captionMyImages  the name doesn't matter . We provide the  class instance its one required argument, which is the target elements: in   this instance $$ 'img' . <script type="text javascript" src="http:  ajax.googleapis.com  ajax libs mootools 1.2.2 mootools-yui-compressed.js">       $ window .addEvent 'domready',function  {    var captionMyImages = new ImageCaption $$ 'img'  ; } ;    4.  Test your work in a web browser; you should see something like the following   screenshot. As you can see, it's not at all different from our original script,   which is a good thing.  [ 240 ]                                                                        Chapter 9  What just happened? We created a basic class instance of our ImageCaption plugin. Now that we know how to  instantiate our plugin, we'll go into more advanced implementations of the plugin.  Creating a more complex instance of the plugin It's time to see our plugin's capability. We'll start by creating multiple instances of it.  Time for action – creating new instances of the plugin Imagine that you'd like several instances of the ImageCaption class. We'll create a situation  where one of the images will have its caption at the top of the image instead of before.  1.  First, modify the HTML markup in such a way that the last image has an ID   of caption-on-top.    ImageCaption Script   <img src="lake_mead.jpg" width="300" height="201"           alt="Lake mead in a speeding car."  >       <img id="caption-on-top" src="red_rocks.jpg"          width="300" height="201"           title="A photo of Red Rock Mountain near Las Vegas,            Nevada."  >     2.	 Next, let's create a class instance of the ImageCaption class. This time, we limit   the image caption to only the image with the ID of caption-on-top.  Also, we use one of our options, captionPosition, to change the default  value of 'after' to 'before'.    var captionOnTop = new ImageCaption $$ 'caption-on-top' , {       captionPosition: 'before'    } ;  [ 241 ]                                                                        Creating Your Own Plugin  3.	 Finally, test your work in a web browser. You should see something like the following  screenshot. Note that only the last photo has an image caption because we limited  the plugin implementation to the image with the ID of caption-on-top.  [ 242 ]                                                                        Chapter 9  Creating multiple instances of the plugin Another great thing about creating a plugin that is flexible is that it gives us the ability to  create multiple instances of it in one web page without a lot of code and duplication. We'll  now create two instances of the class.  Time for action – multiple instances of the ImageCaption plugin We are going to create two instances of our ImageCaption class on the same web page to  outline just how powerful creating plugins can be.  1.	 We're still going to use the same HTML markup and just build on top of the code  we already have from the preceding example. We create a new instance called   captionNormal, and then use this instance for all other images that don't have  the ID of caption-on-top.    var captionOnTop = new ImageCaption $$ 'caption-on-top' , {       captionPosition: 'before'    } ;    var captionNormal =          new ImageCaption $$ 'img[id!=caption-on-top]' , {       captionPosition: 'after'    } ;  [ 243 ]                                                                        Creating Your Own Plugin  2.	 Test your work in a web browser. You should see that the other images will have   their caption text after the img element.  [ 244 ]                                                                        Chapter 9  What just happened? In the previous two examples, we learned how to create a more complex instance of our  ImageCaption plugin, as well as how to create multiple instances of it in the same web  page. By doing so, we can see the advantages of using plugins, in terms of reducing code  duplication and the ability to customize easily.  Now that we have our plugin finished and we know how it works, it's time to document our  code and prepare it for sharing with the public.  Preparing your plugin for the public  If you'd like to make your plugin available to the public for use in their own projects, there  are a few tips and guidelines you can follow. In the following section, we will obey, as much  as we can, MooTools standard documentation. Though there isn't an official standard  method for documentation yet, we can use the official MooTools docs and coding styles in  MooTools More plugin so that our documentation will be familiar to MooTools developers,  making it easy for them to understand and learn how to implement our work.  Documenting your plugin with comments At the top of ImageCaption.js, we should put some meta information about our plugin  so that people studying its working can know a little bit more about it. In MooTools More  plugin, here is the format of this comment block.  Script: Plugin file name    Brief description of the plugin     License:       Licensing type and copyright information     Authors:       FirstName-1 LastName-1 - Website URL        FirstName-2 LastName-2 - Website URL       ...       FirstName-n LastName-n - Website URL *   Let's modify ImageCaption.js with the above information.  [ 245 ]                                                                        Creating Your Own Plugin  Time for action – documenting the ImageCaption plugin Let's document the ImageCaption plugin with the standard MooTools More plugin  documentation block comment  sometimes abbreviated as docblock comments .  1.  Open ImageCaption.js in your source code editor. 2.	 At the very top of the file, insert the following docblock comment.  Script: … …     License:     Authors:  *  var ImageCaption = new Class {    Implements: [Options],    options: {       wrapperClass: 'imageCaption',       wrapperType: 'span',       captionType: 'span',       captionPosition: 'after'    }, ...  3.	 Finally, fill in the information. This is where our design sheet comes in handy  for the description of the script; we can simply take what we wrote down in  the "What it will do" column of the design sheet we developed, and modify  it as necessary. Use tab spaces to indent the docblock comment items. Script: ImageCaption.js    Takes the alt property  or title property  of an image,  and insert it as HTML text to serve as a photo caption  its  description .

What just happened? We documented our plugin with the standard docblock comment that MooTools More  plugin uses. This enables others to better understand our code.  To provide greater context, you might consider also leaving comments on your code to help  others better understand what's going on in the plugin. This will also serve as a reminder for  you when you modify the plugin.  External documentation When you offer a plugin for download, it's a good idea to give people context on what it  does and how to implement it into their work. For this, we can use the Official MooTools  More structure for documenting MooTools More plugins.  Let's create a simple download page template for our plugin. Here's the information we'll  need if we were to follow the official MooTools docs style of external documentation.    PluginName—name of the plugin   Description   Notes—any special requirements or things the user needs to know up-front   Extends—any MooTools Core or More classes that our plugin extends   Syntax—basic structure of instantiating the class   Arguments—required parameters that the class instance needs in order to work,   listed down in an ordered list to denote the parameter order    Options—all the available options   Examples—example usage  	 Returns—after the class has been instantiated, what will the instance object get   back?  [ 247 ]                                                                        Creating Your Own Plugin  Besides the above items, we should also have download information and a section where we  document any changes and updates we make to the plugin  called changelog .  Time for action – creating a basic download page for  the ImageCaption plugin We're going to create a simple HTML web page where we can offer the ImageCaption plugin  for download. We will borrow the content structure from the Official MooTools docs, so that  MooTools users will be familiar with the documentation we're about to write.  1.  Create a new HTML document. You can use the following markup as an HTML   template of your plugin's download page.    PluginName   Description of the plugin.   Notes:        Note 1     Note 2     Extends:    MooTools classes that plugin extends.

Now, modify the template with the ImageCaption information. Remove any  sections that aren't pertinent. In the following screenshot, I've written the   information regarding the ImageCaption plugin.  [ 250 ]                                                                        Chapter 9  [ 251 ]                                                                        Creating Your Own Plugin  What just happened? In the above example, we constructed a download page for our plugin so that we can easily  share it with other developers in an easy-to-understand fashion, giving them the information  that they need in order to understand how to implement the plugin.  Summary  In this chapter, we learned how to build a plugin; a plugin that automatically captions images  in a web page with their respective alt  or title  property.  This is what we covered in this chapter:    Designing a plugin: We created a design sheet that we can easily reference as we   build our plugin, and when we document it for public use.    How to convert a script to a flexible MooTools class: We converted an image   captioning script that we wrote into a class  plugin  with various options that allow  its class instance to be customized.    Instantiating our plugin: We learned how useful plugins can be in allowing us to   customize instances to reduce the amount of code we have to write  and re-write .   How to properly document our plugin: We followed documentation and used the   MooTools coding style and plugin documentation to let other MooTools developers  quickly learn how to implement our plugin into their own projects.  At this point, you're now officially a MooTools rockstar!

MooTools 1.2 Beginner's Guide is an outstanding book. It aims to provide a solid foundation for MooTools new comers, and assumes a limited knowledge of Javascript, HTML, and CSS. It is not just a laundry list of MooTool function definitions, but at provides a complete coverage of how MooTools geared towards a beginner. I highly recommend it.
This is a superb book and excellent resource not just to learn MooTools, but the authors also succeed in installing some pretty important general programming concepts. The authors far exceeded my expectations for this title, and although I have been using MooTools fairly regularly for almost two years, I too picked up a few things.
This is truly a great foundational type of book, not just for MooTools but for web development in general. This book, I believe, has done something I feel is very much needed for MooTools to really take off even more than it has - it has made the framework very approachable and attractive to people not just trying to decide what JS framework to use, but also to those people who aren't even sure what a framework is.
It's fun and easy to read, chock full of code samples that are thoroughly explained and screen shots. I went through every example, and found only one occurrence of a minor error in the code provided - most books are ripe with coding errors, but this book really has none. The code is beautifully structured and everything is clearly explained and laid out.
If you're remotely interested in MooTools, Javascript, or using a Javascript framework - get this book. It is one of the best beginner type of books I have had the pleasure to come across.
