Preface  The study of fungal biotechnology is proceeding at an unprecedented rate with an array of new tools to generate a wealth of disciplines and subdisciplines. By means of modern biotechnology, fungi have justiﬁed their practical application to varied domains of human enterprise, and thus promise considerable potential in the agricultural, food, and environmental spheres. The successful application of fungal biotechnological processes in these areas requires the integration of a number of scientiﬁc disciplines and technologies. These may include subjects as diverse as agronomy, chemistry, genetic manipulation, and process engineering. The practical use of newer techniques such as genetic recombination, bioinformatics, and robotics has revolutionized modern biotechnology-based agri-food industries, and created the enormous range of possible applications of fungi.  Tremendous biodiversity of agriculturally important fungi exists—the beneﬁt of which is not fully harnessed. The level of technology required to take full advantage may range from the simple introduction of a single fungus in biocontrol processes to the extensive manipulation of the organism that facilitates overproduction of a particular enzyme or metabolite. In modern agri-industry, fungi offer many established beneﬁcial roles, particularly as biofertilizers, mycorrhizae, and biocontrol agents of pathogens, pests, and weeds. As pathogens, fungi represent a heavy negative impact on human health, agriculture, and environment. In agriculture, annual crop losses by phytopathogenic fungi in the ﬁeld and also during post- harvest exceed 200 billion Euros, and in the United States alone, over $600 million are spent annually on agricultural fungicides. The balance of beneﬁcial and detrimental effects is reﬂected in many other areas of agriculture and horticulture. Fungi that inhabit tropical or temperate soils, as mycorrhiza, endophytes, phytopathogens, entomopathogens, or simple saprophytes, are signiﬁcant resources in transformation of biological matter, and they offer many bioproducts including secondary metabolites, antibiotics, and catabolic enzymes of enormous potential.  The world has won a crucial battle in the area of food security, but the war is still on. A total of 800 million people—that is, one of every six persons in the developing world—do not have access to food. One-third of all pre – school-age children in the developing countries face food insecurity. In the food and feed arena, fungi are historically important as mushrooms and fermented foods and in baking and brewing. Such roles are supplemented by the provision of fungi to offer food processing enzymes and additives, and more recently the development of protein-based foodstuffs from ﬁlamentous fungi. On the detrimental side, fungi cause extensive spoilage of stored and processed foodstuff. Through direct pathogenesis and biodeterioration of foods and other agricultural commodities, fungi cause considerable economic consequences as well. In these cases, techniques developed from biochemistry and molecular biology can be deployed to analyze the relevant processes, and to evolve tools for the detection, characterization, and tracking of the organisms involved. Although such endeavors may seem rather far removed from the traditional deﬁnition of fungal biotechnology, the information derived can be pivotal in understanding the underlying intricate processes, and arriving at suitable control measures.  The utilization of fungi in the environment is a more recent development, and can have particular association with both food and agriculture, with fungal remediation of land having implications for biofertilizers, mycorrhizae, and food crop  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   development, among many other considerations. The degradative activities of fungi have also been harnessed in programs related to bioremediation of contaminated land, treatment of industrial wastes, and biotransformation of speciﬁc compounds. Many of the applications of fungal biotechnology in these areas rely not on identifying new activities but in harnessing and expanding roles that the fungi undertake normally in the environment.  Several books on the role of fungi in agricultural, food, and environmental applications have appeared since the 1990s. However, subjects relating to these areas are so broad that no single book can provide all the available information. Consequently, this book complements the others by providing valuable information that is not available elsewhere. The book encompasses a broad range of information on biotechnological potential of entomopathogenic fungi, ergot alkaloids, fungi in disease control, the development of mycoherbicides, control of nematodes, control of plant disease, strategies for controlling vegetable and fruit crops, mycotoxigenic fungi, development of biofungicides, production of edible fungi, fermented foods, and high-value products such as mycoprotein, yeasts in the wine industry, the role of fungi in the dairy industry, molecular detection of fungi in food and feeds, antifungal food additives, the importance of fungi in forest and arid ecosystems, the role of fungi in the biomineralization of heavy metals, bioconversion of distillery waste, decoloration of industrial waste, and fungal degradation of cellulose, hydrocarbons, dye water, and explosives.  Together with its companion publication, the Handbook of Fungal Biotechnology, Second Edition  Marcel Dekker, 2004 , this incomparable book reigns as the top source on the role of fungi in agriculture, food technology, and environmental applications. The book will be useful for teachers and students, in both undergraduate and graduate studies, in departments of agricultural microbiology, food science, food technology, food engineering, microbiology, environmental sciences, botany, bioengineering, plant pathology, mycology, and, of course, biotechnology. In addition, the book will be useful for agri-food producers, research establishments, and government and academic units.  No work of this magnitude can be accomplished without the support and contributions of many individuals. I am deeply indebted to my colleagues and associate editors who have assisted me throughout the production of this book. I appreciate the hard work of authors for their up-to-date discussions on various topics and immense persistent cooperation. My gratitude is expressed to my teacher J. L. Lockwood.

The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization predicts that agricultural productivity in the world will be able to sustain the growing human population by 2030 but hundreds of millions of people in developing countries will remain hungry and environmental problems caused by agriculture will remain serious  FAO 2002 . By 2025,83% of the expected global population of 8.5.2 billion will be in the developing world  United Nations 2002 . The social consequences are obvious. Food is a basic human need and right. How can we sustain the food needs of the earth’s biotic community in the 21st century and beyond while preserving environmental quality and the diversity and quality of life on earth  Time, August 26, 2002 ? What solutions can biotechnology provide to address these problems  Khush and Bar 2001 ?  In the last century, the Green Revolution addressed the food needs of the human population through the development of high yielding and early maturing varieties that performed under favorable conditions of nutrition and moisture  Khush 2001 . Prior to this time, increased production was dependent on expansion of land area for crop production. In recent years, yield gain through breeding has not kept pace with population growth  Serageldin 1999 . Furthermore, genotype is not the only factor limiting productivity. Abiotic and biotic stress factors also contribute to losses in yield both pre and postharvest. For example, in Asia these technical constraints on rice production may reduce production by 23%  Evanson et al. 1996 . Socioeconomic constraints also contribute to practices that affect yield. Ninety percent of the world’s rice is grown in Asia on small farms with limited resources. Thus, decisions are made based on economics rather than achieving technically optimum yields. Despite much research on the application of biotechnology to solve these technical production constraints, biotechnology has had limited impact to date on rice production in Asia  Houssain 1997 . This has been due in part to the reluctance to adopt the use of genetically modiﬁed organisms  GMOs  in most countries of Asia. China is the only Asian country that has embraced biotechnology on any notable scale as a solution to technical production constraints in agriculture  Huang et al. 2002; Pray et al. 2002 . For example, over four million smallholders have been able to increase yield and reduce pesticide costs and adverse health effects of applying pesticides by using transgenic Bt-cotton  Pray et al. 2002 . Another constraint relates to the complex- ities of ownership rights that can delay and discourage the scientiﬁc application of biotechnology discoveries and their transfer to the market place  Kowalski et al. 2002 . Finally, public concern about the safety of consuming GMOs has left tons of food aid containing transgenic corn untouched in  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   Zimbabwe and Zambia despite the prediction that 13 million people are now at risk of famine due to severe drought in Southern Africa  Paarlberg 2002 . Organic growers worldwide have rejected GMOs as an allied technology to disease and pest management. Late blight in potato is still very difﬁcult to control in these farming systems  Mader et al. 2002 .  Biotechnology as applied to plant protection against fungal pathogens has seen three phases of development over the last 20 years:  a  the application of molecular markers to marker- assisted breeding and the map-based cloning of genes associated with disease resistance and the plant defense response as well as to study fungal pathogenesis and host recognition;  b  the development of routine methods for stable and transient transformation of plants and fungi with foreign genes; and  c  the application of New Biology approaches to study plant growth and development and mechanisms of plant response to abiotic and biotic stresses and fungal pathogen- esis. The purpose of this short review is to provide a critical analysis of these recent biotechnological approaches to plant protection with emphasis on fungal pathogens.  2 TESTED STRATEGIES  2.1 Marker-Assisted Breeding and Map-Based  Cloning of Genes  2.1.1 Molecular Maps  With the advent of recombinant DNA technology came the application of cloned DNAs as probes to genomic DNA of the source organism and the revelation that different alleles could be detected between individuals based on restriction fragment length polymorphisms  Helentjaris et al. 1985   Figure 1 . Genetic maps based on these and other types of molecular markers  Table 1  were developed for many organisms including crop plants such as rice  McCouch et al. 1988; http:  rgp.dna.affrc.go.jp publicdata geneticmap2000 index. html , lettuce  Kesseli et al. 1994 , tomato  Tanksley et al. 1992 , alfalfa  Brouwer and Osborn 1999 , and Brassica spp.  Kole et al. 2002 , among others. Likewise molecular  Figure 1 Cosegregation of a RFLP marker  R-23 16  with Pi-CO39 t  locus in homozygous F2 susceptible progenies. Genomic DNA of CO39  R, resistant , 51583  S, susceptible  and F2 progenies was digested with Dra1, blotted and probed with R-2316. Recombinant progenies show DNA fragments from both parents. Phosphoimage of Southern blot is shown.  maps were developed for key fungal pathogens such as Magnaporthe grisea  Farman and Leong 1995; Nitta et al. 1997; Skinner et al. 1993; Sweigard et al. 1993 , Phytophtora infestans  van der Lee 2001 , and Leptosphaeria maculans  Pongam et al. 1988 . These studies also began to reveal the complexities of these genomes in terms of repeated DNAs, their function as transposable elements  Goff et al. 2002; Hamer et al. 1989; Kachroo et al. 1997 , their distribution within the genome  Goff et al. 2002; McCouch et al. 1988; Nitta et al. 1997; Yu et al. 2002 , and their role in genome evolution and host recognition  Farman 2002; Farman et al. 2002; Kang et al. 2001; Song et al. 1997; 1998 . Comparative maps were generated in plants by mapping markers across genera and showed considerable synteny within families of plants  Ahn and Tanksley 1993; Bennetzen and Freeling 1993; Chen et al. 1997; Dunford et al. 1995; Gale and Devos 1998; Hulbert et al. 1990; Saghai Maroof et al. 1996; Tanksley et al. 1992 . The mapping of phenotypic markers, both native and induced by mutation, followed closely behind and yielded precise information on the chromosomal location of genes important to plant defense  Ronald et al. 1992; Wang et al. 1995  and fungal host speciﬁcity  Dioh et al. 2000; Smith and Leong 1994; Sweigard et al. 1993  and led to their cloning by chromosome walking  Cao et al. 1997; Farman and Leong 1998; Martin et al. 1993; Orbach et al. 2000; Song et al. 1995; Sweigard et al. 1995 . The cloning of a plethora of disease resistance genes from many plant species has shown that they belong to a small number of structural classes  Brueggeman et al. 2002; Chauhan and Leong 2002; Dangl and Jones 2001; Meyers et al. 1999; Xiao et al. 2001   Figure 2 . By contrast, the predicted structures of fungal cultivar speciﬁcity genes are quite diverse  Bohnert et al. 2001; De Wit and Joosten 1999; Orbach et al. 2000; Sweigard et al. 1995 .  These studies have been complemented by the mapping of candidate genes such as the PR  pathogenesis-related  proteins in plants that were discovered from differential expression of RNA and protein during plant infection  Muthukrishnan et al. 2001  or resistance gene analogs based on the conserved structural features of disease resistance genes  Boyko et al. 2002; Chauhan et al. 2002; Faris et al.

Figure 2 Different classes  A – G  of plant disease resistance genes [reviewed in Chauhan and Leong  2002  : Genes in classes A and B are cytoplasmic proteins differing only in their N-terminal domains; Class C genes encode putative transmembrane molecules with an extracellular LRR domain; Xi21 is a transmembrane protein with an extracellular LRR domain; Pto is a cytoplasmic Ser Thr kinase; RPW8 contains a putative N-terminal TM domain and a CC domain; Hm1 is a unique enzyme that detoxiﬁes a fungal toxin; Abbreviations for domains: TIR, Drosophila Toll Human Interleukin-lreceptor; CC, Coiled-coil; NBS, Nucleotide binding site; LRR, Leucine-rich repeat; TM, Transmembrane; Ser Thr, Serine threonine kinase.  1999; Gebhardt and Valkonen 2001; Huang and Gill 2001; Li et al. 1999; Shen et al. 1998; Speulman et al. 1998 . This analysis has been particularly well advanced in wheat and its relative Aegilops tauschii. Resistance and defense response genes in A. tauschii are localized in clusters primarily in distal telomeric regions of the genome  Boyko et al. 2002  while in Chinese spring wheat defense response genes are localized in clusters and or at distal regions of chromosomes  Li et al. 1999 . In many cases, these genes or gene homologs have been correlated with loci that affect quantitative or single gene resistance in the respective plants. For example, QTLs with large effects in wheat were shown to contain RGAs or clusters of defense response genes such as catalase, chitinase, thaumatins, and an ion channel regulator  Faris et al. 1999 . Similar results are emerging in the genomes of potato  Gebhardt and Valkonen 2001 , Arabidopsis  Speul- man et al. 1998  and pepper  Pﬂieger et al. 2001 .  Efforts are underway to functionally characterize 179 NBS-LRR-encoding genes that may encode disease resist- ance genes in the Arabidopsis genome  Figure 2 . These have been organized into subclasses and their distribution mapped to the chromosomal sequence  Michelmore 2002; www.nibh-rs.ucdavis.edu . A publicly available, draft ordered sequence of the rice genome is anticipated by the end of 2002  http:  rgp.dna.affrc.go.jp cgi-bin statusdb  seqcollab.pl  and will allow comparisons to be done across syntenic regions of grass genomes  http:  www.gramene.org! . The unordered draft sequence of rice varieties Nipponbare  and 93-11 has revealed numerous NBS-LRR-containing sequences as well as sequences potentially encoding other minor classes of R genes and Arabidopsis genes known to control defense response signal transduction  Goff et al. 2002; Yu 2002 . Preliminary studies based on conservation of RGAs in comparative maps of the grasses have shown evidence for some conservation but also redistribution of this class of genes among the grasses  Leister et al. 1998 . Likewise a detailed comparison of a syntenic region between barley and rice did not reveal any candidate resistance genes in rice that could be the ortholog of Rpgl in barley  Han et al. 1999; Kilian et al. 1997 .  2.1.2 Differential cDNA-AFLP Screens  Differential cDNA-APLP screening has been done to isolate hypersensitive response  HR -speciﬁc genes to the Clade- sporium fulvum elicitor Avr4 in tomato and has led to the isolation of a previously known and corresponding disease resistance gene cluster Cf-4 as well as numerous new candidate genes involved in the HR response  De Wit et al. 2002; Takken et al. 2001 . This method is a robust and inexpensive way to identify differentially expressed genes involving the digestion of cDNAs with two different restriction enzymes and the ampliﬁcation of the resulting products after ligation to adapters for these enzymes. The sizes of the resulting amplicons are measured by gel  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   electrophoresis and resulting fragments can be excised and sequenced. Comparison of this method with differential display has shown the cDNA-AFLP method to be superior  Jones and Harrower 1998 . Using the cDNA-AFLP technique, Durrant et al.  2000  found a strong coincidence between the expression of genes involved in race-speciﬁc resistance and the wound response in tobacco cell cultures. Collectively, these candidate genes will provide additional markers for studies of disease resistance traits in the potato and tomato genomes. Infection-speciﬁc cDNA-AFLPs have also been identiﬁed in Arabidopsis thaliana inoculated with Peronospora parasitica  van der Biezen et al. 2000 . Interestingly, most fragments were derived from the fungal pathogen showing the power of this method to study genes expressed in the pathogen, which in many cases may represent a minor component of the mass of the tissue studied. Previous genetic studies by Valent et al.  1991  have shown that infection of some grass hosts by M. grisea is a quantitatively inherited trait. The cDNA-AFLP approach would allow for the identiﬁcation a unique set of cDNA- AFLPs in each progeny showing varying degrees of pathogenicity and in some cases segregating with patho- genicity. This approach has been recently used to create genome-wide transcription maps of Arabidopsis and potato and study inheritance of the cDNA-AFLPs in segregating populations  Brugmans et al. 2002 . Thus phenotypes can be directly associated with molecular genotypes and candidate gene fragments can be excised from gels for further analysis. We are using this approach in an attempt to identify major and minor genes controlling resistance to blast and drought tolerance in Eleusine coracana.  Computational methods for relating the size of the AFLP restriction fragment products to the predicted restriction fragment products from sequenced cDNA libraries have been developed and used to identify putative, infection stage- speciﬁc, pathogenicity factors from the plant pathogenic nematode Globoderu rostochiensis without need for sequen- cing the gel fragments  Qin et al. 2001 . For those organisms having fully sequenced, annotated full length cDNA libraries such as Arabidopsis  Seki et al. 2002 , this approach provides for the rapid functional classiﬁcation of the cDNA-AFLPs.  2.1.5  Identiﬁcation of QTL-Associated Genes  Very few QTL studies in plants have led to the cloning of a single gene within a QTL that is responsible for the variation seen [reviewed in Buckler and Thornsberry  2002 ]. These few examples represent QTLs that had major effects on variation. Buckler and Thornsberry  2002  have proposed that association approaches should be also considered to provide improved resolution and to reduce the time of analysis as mapping populations are not needed since natural variation in a population is investigated instead. The resolution of association that can be obtained depends on the linkage disequilibrium  LD  structure of the population of organism being studied and some insight on candidate gene s  to target. Studies on LD structure have shown that inbreeding plants  such as Arabidopsis have large LD structures on the order of 250 kb or 1 cM  Nordborg et al. 2002  while outbreeding plants like maize have very small LD structures in the order of kbs  Buckler and Thornsberry 2002 . Using this approach, Thornsberry et al.  2001  were able to associate poly- morphisms found in the Dwarf8 gene of maize with variation seen in ﬂowering time.  In Saccharomyces cereviseae whose entire genome sequence is known, a QTL for high temperature growth  Htg  commonly found in clinical isolates was rigorously analyzed to identify the responsible genes  Steinmetz et al. 2002 . Using reciprocal hemizygosity tests, involving selective gene disruption of candidate genes in both parental genomes and then forming diploid hybrids among these strains, three genes were found to contribute to the phenotype in the QTL interval. However, the alleles of two genes came from one parent strain while that of the third came from the other parent. By contrast attempts to employ natural sequence variation or mRNA expression levels determined from several natural isolates of yeast did not provide a clue to which gene s  in the interval contributed to the phenotype. Thus employing LD and association by decent to accelerate gene identiﬁcation in an interval may not always succeed and genetic studies will be required to study inheritance and create reciprocal hemizygotes in targeted regions of the genome. The use of allele-speciﬁc gene silencing methods  see below  may allow this to be done in the F1 generation of plants while targeted gene disruption methods can be used in fungi such as Ustilago maydis that have a stable diploid phase and facile gene knockout system. Transformation of haploid fungi with wild type and disrupted, endogenous or alternative alleles of candidate genes might be a useful strategy for those fungi that cannot form stable diploids. In fact these strategies have been used to unravel the complex functions of the east and west alleles of b mating type locus of U. maydis  Gillissen et al. 1992; Kamper et al. 1995 . Gene silencing has been used in fungi such as P. infestans in which silencing of the fungal elicitin INF1 increased virulence on Nicotiana benthamiana  Kamoun et al. 1998 .  2.1.5 Candidate Gene Validation  It should be emphasized that candidate genes are simply “candidate” genes and that conﬁrmation of a gene’s function with a genetically and or expression-deﬁned phenotype must be done by transformation and complementation tests  Farman and Leong 1998; Orbach et al. 2000; Song et al. 1995; Wang et al. 1999; Yoshimura et al. 1998 . Recently gene silencing has also been successfully applied to study gene function in several plants  Azevedo et al. 2002; Baulcomb et al. 2002; Peart et al. 2002; Wesley et al. 2001 . This method involves the cloning of a small fragment  , 200 nucleotides  of a gene into an expression vector and transforming the plant [reviewed in Baulcomb et al.  2002 ]. The resulting small RNA is made double stranded and then is digested into small dsRNA fragments  siRNA, small interfering RNA , which are thought to guide RNAse to the  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   nascent wild-type gene transcript and causes it to be degraded thus leading to a net loss in the gene’s expression. Direct bombardment of plant cells with dsRNA is also possible  Schweizer et al. 2000 . In the examples described earlier, the speciﬁc genes RAR1 in barley, and Rx, N , Pto, and EDS1 in N. benthamiana implicated in disease resistance signaling were silenced and found to be essential for the signaling process. This approach is being extended to the high throughput analysis of the HR candidate genes from tomato noted earlier  De Wit et al. 2002  as well as in a normalized cDNA library from N. benthamiana  Baulcomb et al. 2002 . Interestingly, many genes in N. benthamiana were found in the preliminary round of analysis to affect the HR while not affecting pathogen growth while some genes were affected in both phenotypes when silenced. Moreover almost 1% of the genome appears to affect the HR response.  2.1.5  Integration of Molecular Biology with Classical Breeding  The application of molecular markers to traditional breeding has provided a powerful method to accelerate breeding as phenotypic tests are not essential and rapid DNA isolation methods using hole punch-sized pieces of leaf tissue are possible in young seedlings  Huang et al. 1997 . Thus tightly cosegregating or gene allele -speciﬁc markers can be followed and conﬁrmation of phenotype can be done on a selected set of plants within a population that are destined for further crossing. Phenotypic validation is essential as recombination, gene conversion or other confounding events can take place, even within the gene being studied, leading to an inaccurate scoring based on markers alone. As we learn more about the function of plant genes and speciﬁc alleles of these genes in disease resistance through mapping and functional tests, we can anticipate the increased application of molecular markers and gene chips  see later  to the breeding of disease resistance in plants. In particular, it will be interesting to know what contribution pathogenesis-related proteins, which are generically present in all plant genomes, make to quantitative resistance. Is expression more efﬁcient in some genomes than others because of the gene’s placement in clusters and or their speciﬁc transcription regulatory elements and or their duplication or absence in some genomes and or the efﬁcacy of speciﬁc alleles? Likewise, what is the genetic and molecular basis of host specialization in the fungi? The location of many disease resistance and defense genes at the ends of chromosomes in wheat may affect their stability through recombination and chromosome breakage as well as their expression through unique chromatin organization  Faris et al. 2000 . The telomeric location of AVR1-PITA in M. grisea has been shown to contribute to its instability leading to strains with increased virulence  Orbach et al. 2000 . The BUF1 gene of M. grisea appears to be readily deleted in one parental chromosome by intrachromosomal recombination of repeated DNA ﬂanking the locus as a result of mispairing of homologous chromosomes during meiosis In Alternaria alternata a conditionally  Farman 2002 .  dispensable chromosome controls production of a host- speciﬁc toxin  Hatta et al. 2002 . Likewise Han et al.  2001  found that genes required for pathogenicity on pea are present on a dispensable chromosome of Nectria haematococca.  Exploitation of the multitude of novel genotypes found in plant germplasm now available in gene banks will often require the methods of molecular mapping and candidate gene isolation described above to identify the genes that contribute to these unique phenotypes  Fulton et al. 1997; Tanksley and McCouch 1997; Xiao et al. 1998 . This is true even for plant genomes for which the entire genome sequence is known, thus allowing candidate genes to be isolated in related genomes. For example, the short stature mutation sg1 found in green revolution rice variety IR8 encodes a mutant biosynthetic gene for gibberellin while the semidwarf phenotype in green revolution varieties of wheat is conferred by mutations in the gibberellin signaling pathway  Sasaki et al. 2002 . In addition, many previously unidentiﬁed genes have been found in every genome that has been sequenced  Goff et al. 2002; Yu et al. 2002 . In the case of disease resistance genes, the functions of only a few are known in each sequenced genome and not all LRR-containing coding sequences are likely to function in disease resistance. For example, a LRR receptorlike transmembrane protein kinase gene, that is gibberellin-induced and speciﬁcally expressed in growing tissues of deep-water rice, may function in hormone signaling  van der Knaap 1999 . The genetic location of disease resistance genes must be determined in the genome that contains the reference genome sequence lacks a functional copy. These fungal genes tenets also apply to the identiﬁcation of involved in plant the complete absence of a recessive gene in fungal strains that have lost cultivar speciﬁcity  van den Ackerveken et al. 1992; Farman et al. 2002 . Furthermore, the recently released genomic DNA sequence of M. grisea having 7X coverage  http:  www-genome.wi.mit.edu annotation fungi  magnaporthe   does not contain the AVRI-CO39 cultivar speciﬁcity gene  RS Chauhan, D Lazaro, and SA Leong, unpublished data . This genome sequence is thus useless without precise genetic mapping data for this AVR gene that can be used to identify in the reference, sequenced genome, a contiguous sequence spanning the genome between these markers. This sequence can then be used to develop new genetic markers and to probe libraries of a strain that does carry AVR1-CO39. In fact this AVR gene was originally cloned using a more laborious chromosome walking strategy in the genome of a strain carrying the functional gene  Farman and Leong 1998 .  recognition. Examples exist  the functional gene if  for  2.2 Transgenic Plants As a Tool for Plant  Protection  Following clues from the molecular biology of plant-microbe interactions, many genes involved in disease resistance and  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   the defense response have been cloned from a variety of plants  Dangl and Jones 2001 . A number of these genes have been tested for their ability to control fungal pathogens in transgenic plants grown in the laboratory and to a more limited extent in the ﬁeld. In addition, natural or synthetic antimicrobial peptides and genes for resistance to pathogen- derived toxins have been introduced into plants. This work is thoroughly reviewed by Bent and Yu  1999 ; Rommens and Kishore  2000 , and Melchers and Stuiver  2000 . Only more recent studies providing signiﬁcant new ﬁndings or extensions of this work will be considered here.  Current efforts have continued to focus on introduction of disease resistance genes, natural and synthetic antimicrobial peptides as well as selected enzymes such as chitinase and b-glucanase into several crop plants and the laboratory and ﬁeld evaluation of these plants for disease resistance. Little has been reported in the literature on the ﬁeld performance of these transgenic plants, although about 5% of all permits for ﬁeld testing of transgenic plants in the United States over the last decade have been for transgenic plants having fungal resistance  Information Systems for Biotechnology 2002 . Moreover, most permits have been issued to companies and this proprietary work is not yet in the public domain. No resistance have been transgenic plants having fungal approved for use as food and or feed  AgBios 2002 . Despite this seemingly limited progress, some promising  achievements have been made in the last few years and many major resistance genes associated with fungal disease resistance have been cloned or at least tagged with molecular markers  Brueggeman et al. 2002; Chauhan and Leong 2002; Gebhardt and Valkonen 2001 . Thus, we can expect many new developments with regard to this ﬁeld in the next decade. Furthermore, despite public concern about transgenic crops, the global adoption of transgenic crops continues to increase, particularly in the United States, where 74.8 million acres were planted in transgenic crops including corn, soybean, cotton, and canola in 2000  Transgenic Crops 2002 . This represented about 50% of the total soybean and cotton acreage planted in that year. The International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotech Applications predicts that the world market for genetically engineered plants will be $8 billion in 2005 and $25 billion by 2010  http:  nature.biotech. com   Figure 3 . Plant pathogens cause $30 – 50 billion dollars of loss annually in crop productivity  Baker et al. 1997  thus justifying this investment in biotechnological approaches to crop protection. The reduction in use of agrochemicals for disease control this technology. Japanese growers spend more than $600 million a year to control diseases on rice  Bonman 1998 . Already, the reduction in insecticide use in China through use of Bt transgenic crops has impacted farmer income and health  Huang et al. 2002; Pray et al. 2002 .  incentive for  is another  important  Figure 3 Impact of genomics on the world economy.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   2.2.1 Defense Pathways  Despite many projections made in the reviews listed earlier, a ﬂurry of published reports has not followed. In many cases, this can be attributed to the observation being made ﬁrst in Arabidopsis and not in a crop plant. However, this lag is being addressed with Arabidopsis genes to assess function in crop plants and through the identiﬁcation of homologs of the Arabidopsis NPR1 Arabidopsis genes. For example, gene  Cao et al. 1998  when overexpressed in rice caused enhanced resistance to the rice pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae  Chern et al. 2001  and the investigators were able to retrieve, in a two hybrid screen, a bZIP family of interactors showing that a similar pathway of signaling is likely present in rice as Arabidopsis  Zhang et al. 1999 . In addition, Yoshioka et al.  2001  have shown that Arabidopsis will respond to the rice fungicide probenazole by induction of PR genes and show enhanced resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 and P. parasitica Emco5. This response was dependent on a functional NPR1 gene and was compromised in NahG transgenic plants further supporting the connection of this pathway with generalized resistance to pathogens in both Arabidopsis and rice. Six NPR1 homologs are reported in the recently released Nipponbare genome sequence  Goff et al. 2002 . It will be interesting to see how overexpression and silencing of these genes affects resistance of rice to key fungal pathogens of rice such as Rhizoctonia solani and M. grisea.  Overexpression of the Arabidopsis ACD2  accelerated cell death  gene leads to tolerance of susceptible Arabidopsis plants to P. syringae infection by reducing disease symptoms associated with cell death such as ion leakage, while allowing the bacteria to grow to similar levels as in susceptible plants  Mach et al. 2001 . Fungal pathogens were not tested.  Broader testing of other genes that have shown wide- spectrum disease resistance to bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens when overexpressed such as Prf  Oldroyd and Staskawicz 1998  and Pto  Tang et al. 1999  in tomato has not been reported. Nor have further reports been made on constitutively active variants of Pto  Rathjen et al. 1999 . Presumably, this approach can be used in other crop plants. Introduction of the bacterial blight resistance gene Xa21 into elite rice cultivars has lead to the expected resistance phenotype when inoculated with X. oryzae pv. oryzae; however, strains that are virulent on Xa21 were not tested nor were other pathogens  Tu et al. 1998 . Performance of these lines was tested under natural ﬁeld conditions without any apparent loss of yield performance  Tu et al. 2000 .  Disease resistance genes from one crop plant have now been successfully used in other crop species. For example, the Bs2 resistance gene from pepper confers resistance to X. campestris pv. vesicatoria in tomato in the laboratory as well as in preliminary ﬁeld tests  Staskawicz et al. 2002; Tai et al. 1999 . Work from my laboratory in conjunction with studies from the laboratories of Mark Farman at the University of Kentucky and Yukio Tosa at Kobe University has suggested that the Pi-CO39  t  gene  Chauhan et al. 2002   for resistance in rice to M. grisea carrying the AVR1-CO39 gene  Farman and Leong 1998  will be useful in other grass species such as perennial rye grass as functional copies of the AVRl-CO39 gene are found in the grey leaf spot pathogen  ML Farman personal communication .  Coexpression of the C. fulvum Avr9 and tomato Cf-9 genes in Brassica napus was investigated as a method for inducing broad-spectrum resistance to fungal pathogens  Hennin et al. 2001 . Induction of PR1, PR2, and Cxc750 was detected following injection of the Avr9 peptide obtained from intercellular ﬂuids of B. napus transgenic plants expressing Avr9 into B. napus expressing the tomato Cf-9 gene. F1 plants and progeny from a cross of the Avr9 and Cf-9 plants were evaluated for resistance to fungi. Disease development was delayed at the site of infection of L. maculans and Erysiphe polygoni but enhanced at the site of infection of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Thus, heterologous expression of AVR-R gene pairs may be a useful strategy for control of fungal disease in a variety of plants. However, the ﬁnding that Arabidopsis resistance gene RPM1 requires another plant gene RIN4 in order to accumulate and interact with avrRpm1 or AvrB  Mackey et al. 2002  as well as the inability to show direct interaction of the products of Avr9 with Cf-9  van der Hoorn et al. 2002; Luderer et al. 2001  suggests that this strategy must be used cautiously. This may explain the inability of van der Hoorn et al.  2002  to see a necrotic response in the nonsolanaceous plant lettuce with this gene combination. More recent reports on the use of the coexpression strategy for plant protection against fungi in solanaceous plants have not been made  Melchers and Stuiver 2000 , however the coexpression of Avr9 and Cf-9 under control of nematode inducible promoters in tobacco has been studied  Bertioli et al. 2001 . Surprisingly these plants underwent spontaneous necrosis in the absence of the nematode. Evidence for activity of the genes was found both in aerial and root tissue.  The cloning of MLO locus of barley  Shirasu et al. 1999 , which confers nonrace-speciﬁc resistance to Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei, has been followed with investigations of its potential use for control of different fungal pathogens. Jarosch et al.  1999  found that in contrast to increased resistance conferred by recessive alleles of MLO to powdery mildew, these barley plants have increased susceptibility to penetration by M. grisea despite showing similar ability to wild type plants to respond to M. grisea elicitor. Likewise Kumar et al.  2001  showed that mlo plants were more susceptible to the necotrophic pathogen Bipolaris sorokini- ana. These reports reveal the complexity of various fungal interactions with the host and the difﬁculty of using a single strategy to control multiple pathogens.  it  Recent work on MLO has shown that  is a novel calmodulin-binding protein that is responsive to both abiotic and biotic stresses through down regulating the oxidative burst and cell death response  Kim et al. 2002a,b; Piffanelli et al. 2002 . Binding to calmodulin is essential to full function of MLO  Kim et al. 2002a . A rice homolog of MLO that also interacts with calmodulin was isolated  Piffanelli et al. 2002 . It will be interesting to see how silencing of MLO in rice  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   plants affects interaction with biotrophic and necotrophic pathogens.  2.2.2 Antifungal Proteins and Peptides  Several new reports have appeared on the use of antifungal proteins such as Ag-AFP from Aspergillus giganteus, chitinase, b-glucanase and Ribozome-Inactivating Proteins  RIP   Chareonpornwattana et al. 1999; Datta et al. 2002; Oldach et al. 2001 , thaumatinlike protein  PR-5   Datta et al. 1999 , and human lysozyme  Takaichi and Oeda 2000  in plants for protection against fungal disease and show different levels of promise for these approaches. Chitinase and AFP appear to increase resistance in wheat, however, the results were not corroborated with levels of these proteins in transgenic plants  Oldach et al. 2001 . Other efforts to introduce chitinases in wheat have led to gene silencing  Chareonpornwattana et al. 1999 . The recent isolation of cDNA clones for novel acidic chitinases and b-1,3-glucanases from wheat spikes infected by Fusarium graminearum  Li et al. 2001  is exciting as these enzymes may be more effective in control of this pathogen in this tissue. Introduction of infection-related chitinase and rice thaumatinlike protein into rice has led to moderate control of sheath blight caused by R. solani  Datta et al. 2002 . Field evaluation of these plants is underway. Finally, studies on carrot transformed with human lysozyme, which can cleave b-1,4 glycosidic bonds of peptidoglycan in bacterial cell walls and chitin in fungal cell walls, suggest this approach may have promise for control of E. heraclei and A. dauci  Takaichi and Oeda 2000 .  that  Natural and synthetic peptides have been evaluated for control of pre and postharvest damage by fungi. Ali and Reddy  2000  studied four cationic peptides for antimicrobial activity in vitro and in plants. All were shown to have signiﬁcant activity in the micromolar range against P. infestans and A. solani completely inhibiting growth of the fungi on potato tissues. Alfalfa antifungal peptide defensin from seeds of Medicago sativa was shown by Gao et al.  2000  to have signiﬁcant activity against Verticillium dahliae in vitro, and transgenic potato plants expressing the peptide showed a reduced area under the disease progress curve compared to vector control plants. Moreover, resistance was correlated with the levels of peptide found in root samples.  Similar results were obtained for transgenic potato plants expressing a N terminus-modiﬁed cecropin-melittin cationic peptide chimera  Osusky et al. 2000 . The efﬁcacy of the peptide against Phytophthora cactorum and F. solani infection was demonstrated in variety Desiree while not affecting plant growth or tuber morphology or size. Tubers remained resistant for more than one year and the peptide could be detected in this tissue. By contrast transgenic Russet Burbank plants showed signiﬁcant morphological alterations and resembled lesion mimic plants, produced very small tubers, and showed less resistance to P. cactorum. Trangenic raw tubers were fed to mice without signiﬁcant growth effects relative to untransformed tubers. Rajasekaran et al.  2001   have shown that the synthetic antimicrobial peptide DE41 is active at the micromolar range against many important bacterial and fungal plant pathogens. Crude protein extracts from transgenic tobacco plants constitutively expressing D4E1 showed ability to reduce growth of A. ﬂavus and V. dahliae while control plant extracts did not  Cary et al. 2000 . Furthermore, the transgenic plants showed increased resistance to Colletotrichum destructivum. The D4El gene has been introduced into cotton and was shown to be present in cottonseed. Reduction of aﬂatoxin in cottonseed oil is a desired outcome. Dow AgroSciences LLC has licensed the technology and is collaborating with USDA-ARS scientists who developed the technology to further evaluate the efﬁcacy of the transgenic plants  SeedQuest 2002 . The effects of this peptide on plant growth or other nontarget organisms have not been reported. Finally, the antimicrobial peptide MS1-99, an analog of magainin 2, a defense peptide secreted from the skin of the African clawed frog, was expressed from the chloroplast genome of tobacco and showed signiﬁcant ability to control many phytopathogenic bacteria and fungi  DeGray et al. 2001 . Trangenic plant homogenates inhibited the fungi A. ﬂavus, F. monilzjbrme and V. dahliae and anthracnose lesions were absent infected with C. destructivum. Transformation of the chloroplast genome is an innovative approach to control the spread of the transgene as pollen will not carry the transgenic chloroplast. Evidence for pollen transfer of transgenes at the commercial ﬁeld level is now available  Reiger et al. 2002 .  in transgenic plant  While the use of peptides has shown signiﬁcant promise, thorough testing of the toxicity of plants producing these peptides will be important. Their potential ability to inhibit microﬂora that are essential to plant health as well as health of animals, humans, and birds needs careful evaluation. Feeding raw potatoes containing a cecropin-melittin cationic peptide chimera to mice was not a convincing test of the toxicity as the animals do not normally eat this food and lost weight on this diet until it was supplemented with normal feed  Osusky et al. 2000 . More realistic tests are needed. The use of cooked potatoes should be tested. Furthermore, only short-term effects were studied. The survival and biological impact of large quantities of these peptides in the environment resulting from crop plant decay also needs to be evaluated. These issues are only beginning to be addressed in a multitrophic context for insect resistant transgenic plants  Groot and Dicke 2002 . These issues need to be critically addressed at the time of risk assessment. Public concern has been spurred largely by a lack on conﬁdence in transgene technology because of the lag time in responding to the large-scale effects that agrochemicals are having on human and environmental health despite early warnings by Carson  1962  many decades ago.  2.2.3 Phytotoxin Detoxiﬁcation  In planta studies of the hydroxylation and glycosylation of destructin B, a phytotoxin produced by A. brassicae, to a nontoxic product have shown a correlation between plant resistance with phytoalexin production and the efﬁciency of  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   these modiﬁcations of the toxin in Brassica spp.  Pedras et al. 2001 . These data suggest that improved resistance can be engineered in or transferred within Brassica hosts of A. brassicae by enhancing hydroxylation of destruxin B.  The analysis of the biosynthetic pathway of saponins, antimicrobial metabolites of plants, may allow the transfer of these genes to other plants. Mutants defective in the saponin avenacin in oat were studied and shown to deﬁne seven loci and to be compromised in their ability to resist fungal attack  Haralampidis et al. 2001 . The sad1 gene was shown to encode b-amyrin synthase.  3 NEW INITIATIVES AND PROSPECTS: THE  NEW BIOLOGY  Function  3.1 From Genome Sequence to Gene to Mutant to  Research in the last ﬁve years has been increasingly driven by the availability of whole genome sequences and cDNA libraries from many plants and microorganisms  National Center for Biotechnology Information, http:  www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov . The Arabidopsis genome sequence was released in 2001  Arabidopsis Genome Initiative 2001  and the draft DNA sequence of two subspecies of rice was released this year  Goff et al. 2002; Yu et al. 2002 . Likewise, several fungal genome sequences are now available for model organisms as well as plant pathogens  http:  www-genome. wi.mit.edu annotation fungi magnaporthe ; http:  www- genome.wi.mit.edu annotation fungi neurospora ; Friedrich et al. 2001; Turgeon and Yoder 2002 . Consortia of scientists have been established to bring together fungal genomic resources for a research community. These include M. grisea  http:  www.riceblast.org   and Phytophthora  http:  www. ncgr.org pgc; Torto et al. 2002 .  Comparative analysis of several fungal genome sequences including that of C. heterostrophus, F. graminearum, and Botrytis cinerea, with those of Neurospora crassa and yeast has led to the identiﬁcation of putative common essential genes, candidate fungal-speciﬁc genes, and candidate pathogenicity genes  Turgeon and Yoder 2002 . Systematic analysis of these candidate pathogenicity genes through knock out studies is underway. In addition, genes for polyketide synthases and nonribosomal peptide synthetases are being identiﬁed and systematically disrupted since many secondary products from fungi are known to have functions as host-speciﬁc toxins.  source fungus to create a disruption of the sequence in the genome by gene replacement. This method has been adapted to a high throughput scheme and the resulting mutants are then tested for phenotypic alterations using a battery of tests. The success of this scheme is not dependent on access to the full genome sequence of a fungus.  Agrobacterium tumefaciens T-DNA is also being used to directly mutagenize the genome of a number of fungi  De Groot et al. 1998; Mullins et al. 2001; Rho et al. 2001  as well as plants such as rice  An et al. 2001  and Arabidopsis  see the following: Krysan et al. 1999 . M. grisea and F. oxysporum mutants altered in virulence have been identiﬁed  Mullins et al. 2001; Rho et al. 2001 . The randomness of insertion in the target genome and the possibility that some mutants may be caused by secondary events needs to be thoroughly evaluated in fungi, nevertheless, this method provides a straightforward way of tagging genes in fungi and appears to be superior to restriction enzyme-mediated insertion  REMI  mutagenesis in which the transforming DNA containing a selectable marker is linearized and transformed with a restriction enzyme to promote insertion at restricted sites in the genome  Balhadere et al. 1999; Bolker et al. 1995; Lu et al. 1994; Sweigard et al. 1998 . This method did not generate certain kinds of expected mutants presumably due to the lack of sites for this enzyme in the genes or the inaccessibility of the genes to enzyme because of their lack of expression under the conditions of growth and or transformation. Mutants lacking a DNA insertion in the mutated gene have also been documented using this method. Thus reisolation of the mutant gene is not simple.  3.3 Transient Expression of Fungal Genes in  Plants  Sequenced libraries of cDNAs from Phytophthora are being systematically tested for their ability to induce resistance or disease symptoms in tobacco and potato by transient expression using potato virus X  PVX  and A. tumefuciens T-DNA vectors as delivery systems  Takken et al. 2000; Torto et al. 2002 . Agroinﬁltration has been used in several plant systems to study the interaction phenotype of products of avirulence genes and speciﬁc resistance genes  van der Hoorn et al. 2000; Tai et al. 1999 . Often plants are scored simply for formation of a HR or necrosis. Whether this is truly representative of the natural response to infection is unclear. It will be interesting to see what kinds of the candidate genes are found and whether their disruption or silencing corroborates the heterologous expression tests described here.  3.2 Random Mutagenesis with Transposons  3.4 Microarrays  Another strategy for identiﬁcation of pathogenicity genes has been to introduce transposons in fungal genomic DNA cloned into cosmid vectors  Hamer et al. 2001 . The insertion site of the transposon is sequenced to assess what function has been disrupted. Each tagged insert is then transformed into the  With the recent availability of massive amounts of DNA sequence data for many organisms, new technologies have emerged to study this information in a high through put and cost effective manner. Microarrays based on spotting of  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   thousands of cDNAs on glass surfaces or synthesis of gene- speciﬁc oligonucleotide microarray  OMA  on glass surfaces have allowed the parallel analysis of expression of large numbers of genes  Brown and Botstein 1999; Fodor 1997; Lashkari et al. 1997 . For example, new understanding of:  a  stage-speciﬁc gene expression during sporulation in yeast  Chu et al. 1998 ;  b  the functional role of a set of yeast mutants each carrying a deletion in one of 5,916 open reading frames  96.5% of total   Giaever et al. 2002 ;  c  the transcriptional hierarchy of metabolic genes in yeast  DeRisi et al. 1997 ; and  d  gene expression during meiosis  Primig et al. 2000  has resulted from the use of OMAs. Microarrays are currently being used to study global gene expression in Arabidopsis  Zhu et al. 2001a; see later  and rice  Zhu et al. 2001b .  One caution in using these arrays is that they only provide information on gene expression  RNA abundance  while many cellular processes are regulated at the translational or posttranslational levels. Giaever et al.  2002  found that many genes required for ﬁtness through gene knock out did not show increased expression using OMAs. Moreover, many genes that showed increased expression were not required for ﬁtness. In addition, Primig et al.  2000  found very different expression proﬁles when they compared RNA from different yeast strains undergoing meiosis. The overlapping gene set could be correlated with genes previously known to have a role in meiosis. This result emphasizes the need to use different isolates to ﬁnd the core set of genes that are needed for a biological process that shows differential gene expression.  3.5 Proteomics  Proteomics is the study of all proteins from a living organism. The most advanced approach is the use of mass spectrometry to study whole cell tissue protein content and modiﬁcations  Haynes and Yates 2000 . The method has also been used to analyze proteins in biological complexes  Link et al. 1999 . Although this technology is very new and requires sophisticated equipment and technical expertise, it offers a more realistic view of the physiology of the cell at a given point in time. Many studies that have traced RNA expression as a means to identify important genes in a biological process have led to disappointing results when the gene s  is disrupted  Basse et al. 2000; Giaever et al. 2002; Timberlake and Marshall 1988 . Furthermore, redundancy in gene function can confound this type of study. Analysis of the proteome can distinguish which family member is made and modiﬁcations that it may have undergone.  Initial studies on the identiﬁcation of membrane proteins from arbuscular mycorrhizas formed between M. truncatula and Glomus versiforme led to the identiﬁcation several protein from microsomes fractionated from mycorrhizal roots using 2D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF-MS  Mussa et al. 2002 . Spectra of the four proteins identiﬁed were queried against the EST  expressed  sequence tag  database of M. truncatulu, and good matches were found with calreticulin, nonseed lectins and an ion channel. These early results are promising, as a homolog of the nonseed lectins is known to be part of the pea nodule where it is thought to function as a storage protein. A similar relationship at this location of the root might exist between the plant and fungus at the arbuscular membrane.  3.6 Plant Model Systems  Considerably more progress has been made toward our understanding of plant genes to date because of the higher investment that has been made in plant biology. From 1985 – 1995, the Rockefeller Foundation sponsored an international research program in rice biotechnology that led to the generation of rice molecular maps, transformation of rice, and the characterization of many basic biochemical pathways for abiotic stress and disease and insect resistance in rice. The United States National Science Foundation  NSF -Arabidopsis 2010 and Plant Genome Initiatives have also had a major impact on plant science research in the last decade  Ausubel 2002 . Many of the projects deal with how Arabidopsis responds to and resists pathogens such as:  a  the Arabidopsis RPM1 disease resistance signaling network;  b  expression proﬁling of plant disease resistance pathways;  c  functional and comparative genomics of NBS-LRR-encoding genes;  d  Functional genomics of quantitative traits. Expression level polymorphisms  ELPs  of QTLs affecting disease resistance pathways in Arabidopsis; and  e  the endgame for research genetics. Isolation and distribution of a knockout mutant for every gene in Arabidopsis. More information can be obtained at the web sites of these projects  Ausubel 2002 . National Science Foundation Plant Genome has also funded allied work in other crops plants  httn:  www.nsf.gov . This research represents the cutting edge of plant science using the latest tools: microarrays to study gene expression, T-DNA insertion mutants, large scale mutant hunts, molecular mapping, and structure-function analysis of genes at the whole genome level.  High through put methods for creating mutants using gene silencing that allow gene libraries or cDNA collections to be cloned in a silencing vector using an in vitro recombinase should facilitate systematic functional analysis of plant genes in plant defense  Wesley et al. 2001 . Conventional mutagenesis of plants carrying a construct such as a luciferase or GUS  b-glucuronidase  reporter gene under the control of a defense gene promoter are yielding new and interesting classes of mutants with constitutive broad-spectrum disease resistance  Maleck et al. 2002 . These mutants showed strong resistance to P. parasitica isolates Noco2 and Emco5 and variable resistance to Elysiphe cichoracearum. In addition to T-DNA, endogenous and heterologous plant transposable elements are being used to systematically mutate the rice genome and isolate promoter elements via enhancer trapping elements  Greco et al. 2001; Hirochika et al. 2001 . The transcriptome of Arabidopsis has been characterized during  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   systemic acquired resistance  Maleck et al. 2000 . Analysis of 402 putative transcription factors from Arabidopsis using OMAs allowed the identiﬁcation of transcription factors that may be involved in regulation of various pathways responsive to environmental stress and bacterial infection  Chen et al. 2002 . These systems level approaches to analysis of model plants are expected to yield an integrated view of how every gene contributes to the growth and development and defense of plants.  4 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION  The tools of biotechnology have already had a signiﬁcant impact on control of fungal plant pathogens. The use of molecular markers to create genetic maps, identify, transfer, and clone plant genes of importance to plant protection has had a spectacular beginning. With the availability of new types of markers such as cDNA-AFLP and OMAs as well as the genomic and cDNA sequences of many important fungal pathogens and model dicot and monocot plants, rapid progress in this area is anticipated in the near and distant future. These and other genome-wide approaches will lead to an integrated view of the defense response for different classes of fungal pathogens as well as the core of pathogen- speciﬁc genes required for successful plant infection of host plants.  This information will lead to new technologies for plant protection based on rational design whether through molecular breeding or transgene or chemical approaches. At present, few promoters related to disease control from plants have been thoroughly characterized. Likewise, our under- standing of the rapid turnover of some defense gene products, such as Rpm1, relationship gene transcription has to levels of protein expression and modiﬁcation and degradation for components of the defense response is unknown. Moreover these relationships must be known at the cellular not tissue level. Knowledge of the complete cascade of players involved defense signaling for one speciﬁc pathogen elicitor effecter is still unavailable. Clearly there is much to learn and much promise ahead based on the knowledge to be gained.  is very poor. What  Public conﬁdence in these approaches will  require improved communication of the scientiﬁc research commu- nity with the public sector and comprehensive risk assessment supported by high quality research. Biotechnology is not a solution but a tool to be used along with the many other tools that already exist for plant protection, such as crop rotation and other cultural practices. The appropriate and reasoned use of this technology is needed.  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT  I thank Dr. Rajinder S. Chauhan for critically reading this manuscript and providing the images used for the ﬁgures.

Phenotypic characters, e.g., morphology and growth on selected media have traditionally formed the basis for fungal taxonomy  Domsch et al. 1980; Mantle 1987; Pitt 1979; Raper and Fennell 1977; Raper and Thom 1949 . Advancements in the developments of analytical method- ology have allowed the use of “secondary” metabolite proﬁling for fungal identiﬁcation and been used to revise the taxonomy within genera of Penicillium, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Alternaria, and their perfect states. The success of metabolite proﬁling in the classiﬁcation of ﬁlamentous fungi relies on the fact that a major part of the fungal growth is expressed by the production of numerous diverse metabolites, most of which are excreted into the media. The extracellular metabolites have been termed the exome, a subgroup of the metabolome  all metabolites , and these are related to the genome as illustrated in Figure 1. The reasons why most ﬁlamentous fungi produce such a diverse proﬁle of secondary metabolites are still unclear, but they are probably produced as a result of stimuli and are directed against, or support actions on, receptor systems  Christophersen 1996  or as outward directed  extrovert  differentiation products. Possible others functions, include chemical signaling between organisms  Christophersen 1996; Frisvad 1994a . Williams et al.  1989  described their functions as “. . . serve the producing organisms by improving their survival ﬁtness . . . .”  Commonly used macro- and micromorphological char- acters  rough conidia, ﬂuffy mycelia, color, etc.  can be difﬁcult to determine unequivocally and are difﬁcult to link to gene sequences. The production of secondary metabolites can typically be linked to a particular gene sequence or gene cluster and is most likely to be regulated as a response to growth factors. However, there are far more metabolites than genes as demonstrated by modern metabolomics. Schwab  2002  estimates that there might be as many as 10 – 100 metabolites for each gene in higher organisms. Therefore, a metabolite proﬁle can provide an indirect method of detecting a large set of metabolite coding genes which are expressed at the same time. Metabolite proﬁling also allows detection of a speciﬁc gene cluster through the identiﬁcation of different compounds from that pathway. Turner  1971  and Turner and Aldridge  1983  suggested subdividing secondary metabolites according to their biosynthetic origin. In this way a selected metabolite originating from a pathway, e.g., polyketide, terpene, diketopiperazine, and cyclopeptide is treated as representative of that particular pathway. This is important, as only a limited number of members of a biosynthetic pathway are expressed under a given set of conditions, e.g., external stimuli and growth conditions  Section 2.2 . Mantle  1987  has reviewed secondary metabolite production by Penicillium species based on biosynthetic pathways. He suggested a renaming of original isolates according to new taxonomic systems and emphasized that frequent misidentiﬁcations have lead to errors, especially for isolates no longer available for the scientiﬁc community. Frisvad and Filtenborg  1983  ﬁrst demonstrated the advantage of secondary metabolite proﬁling in fungal taxonomy with the genus Penicillium,  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   2 MYCOLOGY AND BIOSYSTEMATICS Biosystematics can be divided into taxonomy  ¼ the theory of  classiﬁcation , nomenclature, identiﬁcation and phylogeny. The species is the central concept in biosystematics. It is important to note that classiﬁcation deals with the natural nonoverlapping hierarchical grouping of isolates into species, species into genera, etc, whereas identiﬁcation deals with allocating new isolates to already existing classes in an effective, nonequivocal, and practical way.  2.1 Classical Identiﬁcation  The characters most often used in identiﬁcation keys for ﬁlamentous fungi are based on arrangements, forms, sizes, and ornamentations of mature asexual and sexual structures. Another kind of latent characters used in identiﬁcation keys are responses to abiotic factors such as macromorphology and colony growth rate or diameter at different temperatures, water activities, pH, redox potential, etc.  Pitt 1973 . The problem with all these different tests is the potential large number needed  economy  and the need for standardization. Morphological features occasionally overlap or can be difﬁcult to record precisely  Frisvad et al. 2000 , as they may be dependent on the media used  for example different brands  and is particularly pronounced for colony diameters and colors. Standardization of incubation conditions  Pitt 1973  and the use of chemically deﬁned media have been proposed to avoid these problems. Image analysis has also been explored in Penicillium  Do¨rge et al. 2000 , here the information found in fungal colonies such a colony texture, diameter and color from very accurately recorded and calibrated images could identify terverticillate penicillia, and has recently been used for clones recognition  Hansen et al. 2003 .  In order to identify ﬁlamentous fungi it is necessary to identify the fungi to genus level before using traditional keys or chemotaxonomic methods. Filamentous fungi can be identiﬁed to genus level by the use of keys [e.g., Samson et al.  2000 ]. Once the genus is known references to keys and taxonomic treatments can be found, but as new species are described each year, it may be difﬁcult to obtain good and up- to-date keys for large genera. Knowledge of the associated funga  mycobiota  of different habitats can be a major help in identifying the most common species  Filtenborg et al. 1996 . For example the only Penicillia that can grow on citrus fruits are Penicillium italicum, P. ulaiense, and P. digitatum, so identiﬁcation of greenish mould growth on citrus fruits will be relatively easy.  2.2 Cultivation and Media for Metabolite  Proﬁling  Most fungi have evolved on solid matrices, and hence solid media are generally better than liquid media in terms of quantity and  Figure 1 The proﬁle of extra-cellular metabolites or the exome is linked to genomics through a mostly one-way connection from the genome. Far more metabolites than genes are found in most cells, and metabolite proﬁles are phenotypic characters as are most other characters used in classical mycology.  using a simple agar-plug-TLC technique. They later also included HPLC methods in their studies. Efﬁcient identiﬁ- cation based on metabolite proﬁling relies on combining this information with more classical tools and a´ priori knowledge. For general use it is important to know at least the genus of the fungus being studied and which growth media to use. The analytical methodology depends on the group genus being studied, but can vary from the simple TLC approach to hyphenated LC-MS-MS. This combined approach is illus- trated in Figure 2. It to note that efﬁcient identiﬁcation of fungi will, in most cases, require the use of proﬁles of metabolites from crude extracts, rather than single or selected metabolites. However, a limited number of species-speciﬁc metabolites can be used efﬁciently as markers for particular species in particular cases. This chapter focuses on the practical considerations in the use of metabolite proﬁles in identiﬁcation. The text follows the general approach illustrated in Figure 2, and four different cases of various techniques are given.  is important  Figure 2 Efﬁcient identiﬁcation of ﬁlamentous fungi requires a synthesis of mycology, analytical chemistry and informatics although the metabolite proﬁle can sometime give the full answer.

On agar media, any contamination is usually visible, and an agar plug technique can be used to sample different parts of the fungal colony and its surroundings.  In general, agar media for optimal secondary metabolite and mycotoxin production have been based on media containing yeast extract. Yeast extract sucrose  YES  broth was introduced as a “semisynthetic” broth medium for aﬂatoxin production by Davis et al.  1966 . It was later shown to be a very effective general secondary metabolite production medium when used with a crude yeast extract  DIFCO or SIGMA  and formulated as an agar medium  YES agar  by Frisvad  1981 ; Frisvad and Filtenborg  1983 , and has been used for Penicillium, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Alternaria, and many other fungal genera  Andersen et al. 2002; Thrane 2001 . Other media including Czapek yeast autolysate  CYA  agar, Potato dextrose  PD  agar can be used to supplement YES agar, depending on the genus being considered, as seen in Table 1. Some of these semisynthetic agar media can occasionally give problems as certain brands of yeast extract, malt extract, potato extract, agar, peptone, or tryptone, etc. may differ signiﬁcantly in composition, although this may be diminished by adding trace elements and magnesium sulphate  Filtenborg et al. 1990 .  3 TECHNIQUES FOR METABOLITE  PROFILING  Metabolite proﬁling for identiﬁcation in its simplest form consists of three elements: getting hold of the metabolites  e.g., extraction , determining the compounds  the proﬁle   e.g., analysis , and data processing  e.g., chemometrics . This will include all relevant metabolites needed for reliable identiﬁcation of a fungus, and as discussed in the previous  section, proﬁles of metabolites rather than single metabolites should be used for identiﬁcation. It is very important to note that metabolite proﬁles are strongly inﬂuenced by the analytical scheme used, thus full metabolite proﬁles can only be compared if they are produced by the same analytical protocol. Over the years, many speciﬁc techniques have been developed to determine a few selected metabolites, mostly known mycotoxins, from cultures and from complex samples such as food and feed. Some of these methods can be expanded to include a broad spectrum of metabolites, but dedicated proﬁling methods are required to efﬁciently obtain the best possible metabolite proﬁles and allow reliable identiﬁcation.  Developments in chromatography and mass spectrometry  MS  have greatly increased their resolution, sensitivity and productivity in analytical chemistry. There is, therefore, a set of tools available that allows fast metabolite screening from a very small amount of sample. As a result, a broad range of metabolites can now be determined in one analysis with high selectivity. Furthermore, several of the newer techniques have shown their potential as general rapid proﬁling methodology working directly on raw samples or extracts. These include MS, nuclear magnetic resonance, and FT-IR  including NIR , which eliminate a time consuming chromatographic step. However, currently it is not wise to fully eliminate chromatography and one should rather use systems based on complementary methods. In planning an identiﬁcation from an analytical approach the following considerations must be made:  a  A´ priori knowledge about metabolites produced by the genus,  b  whether the general chemical classes are alkaloids, acids, neutrals, volatiles, as well as large or small molecules,  c  sample matrix or growth medium composition and interference,  d  number of samples to handle,  e  expected biological variation, and if large or small chemical diversity is expected,  f  sensitivity of analytical instrumentation, and  g  cost.

Figure 3 The agar plug extraction method is a simple scheme by which extracts for metabolite proﬁling can be prepared rapidly using only a minute amount of solvent  Smedsgaard 1997a .  3.1 Extraction  The ﬁrst step in metabolite proﬁling for fungal identiﬁcation is to obtain the metabolites produced by the fungi growing on some sort of substrate, see Section 2.2 and Table 1. Depending on the group of metabolites of interest, two main schemes can be used to collect metabolites for a proﬁle:  a  an extraction approach is used for the nonvolatile metabolites, as illustrated in Figure 3, in combination with HPLC and or MS and  b  a headspace approach is used for the volatile metabolites as illustrated in Figure 4, in combination with GC or GC – MS.  Nearly all sample preparations start with either an extraction based on distribution of the analyte between two immiscible phases or by a gas phase sampling. One phase is the fungus  biomass  and or growth medium, the other is the solvent or a purge gas. Some physical  thermal or mechanical  assistance may be needed to help the rapid distribution of metabolites between the two phases. There may be some overlap in the compounds determined by the two different approaches, e.g., some of the terpenes can be found in both extracts and by headspace analysis. The key point is to select extraction solvents with a high afﬁnity for interest. Adjusting pH can enhance the metabolites of solubility of metabolites in the extraction solvent. Furthermore, choice of extraction solvent can also be used to favor extraction of a particular subgroup, and a selection of several solvents can be used to extend the range of metabolites.  Many extraction protocols use grams of material and many milliliters of solvents, however these procedures can be miniaturized due to the very high sensitivity and selectivity of modern instrumentation. A simple method is the plug extraction method  Smedsgaard 1997a  illustrated in Figure 3, where a few 6 mm plugs  0.5 – 1 cm2 area  are cut from plates of the fungus and extracted with about 500 ml of solvent. The extraction is performed ultrasonically to improve extraction efﬁciency and speed. is compatible with the subsequent analysis it can be injected directly, otherwise the solvent have to be evaporated and the sample redissolved in an appropriate solvent  Figure 3 . Other analytical applications requires a more elaborate sample preparation particularly if GC – MS analysis is required.  the raw extract  If  If fungi are to be identiﬁed in complex natural samples, e.g., foods or building materials a much more elaborate sample preparation protocol is needed. It will nearly always be necessary to remove interfering matrix compounds, by liquid – liquid extraction or by passing the crude extract through a disposable mini-column  solid phase extraction, SPE .  Figure 4 Collection of volatile metabolites using adsorption 00 techniques. A stainless steel petri dish lid with a standard 1 4 Swagelocke ﬁtting in the centre is used to hold the different adsorption tubes or with a septum to be used with a SPME syringe. Sampling is done by placing an adsorption tube, open only in the lid end, in the ﬁtting and leaving the lit on the cultures for a few hours. The tube or syringe is then analyzed.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   Sampling the volatile metabolites from fungi growing in culture can be done by two approaches: either by one of three different dynamic headspace  HS  methods using direct collection of volatiles present in the gas phase above the growing fungus or by extraction of volatiles present in the fungal biomass  or sample . Figure 4 illustrates the simple method to collect volatile metabolites by diffusive sampling described by Larsen and Frisvad  1994; 1995c . The volatile metabolites are collected by adsorption on an adsorbent, e.g., activated carbon black, a synthetic polymer like Tenax TA, or recently a coated ﬁber  Solid Phase Microscale Extraction, SPME . Carbon black tubes are normally desorbed using solvents, e.g., dichloromethane or diethylether. Tenax tubes and SPME ﬁbers are analyzed by thermal desorption, the SPME ﬁbers in a split splitless injection port, the tubes using thermal desorption equipment.  3.2 HPLC  HPLC is by far the most common analytical technique used for metabolite proﬁling due to its versatility, relative ease of operation, and the broad spectrum of metabolites that can be determined directly. Basically, HPLC is an integration of a separation and detection system working with separation in a liquid phase.  Metabolite proﬁling using HPLC is almost always done using gradient elution on reversed phase material  C8 – C18 phase or similar  with polar mobile phase. The most widely used mobile phases are water-acetonitrile or water-methanol containing some modiﬁer, e.g., tri-ﬂuoroacetic acid  TFA . The ﬂow rates used for metabolite proﬁling depend on the columns, but in general analytical columns with diameters between 2 and 4 mm are used at ﬂow rates from 0.2 to 1 ml minute. Smaller diameter columns will give a better separation at the cost of lower absolute sensitivity, as a smaller amount of sample can be injected. As described in the introduction to this section identiﬁcation of fungi from metabolite proﬁles can be done either by detection of speciﬁc metabolites or by using the full chromatogram as a proﬁle. In both cases it is important to keep the analytical conditions as constant as possible. In the ﬁrst case, the identiﬁcation of metabolites can be determined from the retention times used together with standards. Possible spectral detection is described later. The effect of small, unavoidable shift, in retention time over time can be reduced by using a series of alkylphenones to calculate a retention index for each peak in the chromatograms  Frisvad and Thrane 1987 . If the full proﬁles are to be used constant analytical conditions will reduce the alignment needed  Nielsen et al. 1998; 1999 . In cases of metabolite proﬁling, detection of compounds eluting from the HPLC column is mostly done by UV detection, ﬂuorescence detection  FLD , or MS. The UV detection accounts for the majority of the applications, however there is currently considerable growth in the use of MS  see section 3.4 . In classical HPLC, compounds are detected by measuring the absorbance of the column eluent at a speciﬁc  wavelength. The chromatogram [e.g., plot of absorbance vs. time] shows peaks representing the compounds eluting from the column. This technique requires that the compounds have a chromophore that absorbs light at the selected wavelength and that the solvent is transparent  or at least does not have any signiﬁcant absorption . Fluorescence can be measured with a selected pair of excitation emission wavelengths in a similar fashion, if the compounds have a ﬂuorophore. Several mycotoxins have distinct ﬂuorophores, whereas others can be derivatized prior to detection.  the analytical method. This requires that  Identiﬁcation of fungi can in some cases be achieved by identifying a set of speciﬁc metabolites produced, regardless of relevant metabolites to be identiﬁed with high certainty, and usually requires either use of an authentic standard and or several spectral and chromatographic techniques.  Spectral detection by a UV-spectrometer  DAD or PDA  is commonly used as these techniques greatly enhance the information available by providing structural information about each peak  compound . In HPLC – UV detection, a UV-spectrum is collected at regular intervals in such a way that between 10 – 20 spectra are collected across a chromato- graphic peak. The resulting data ﬁle is illustrated in Figure 5 and it is important to understand the structure of these ﬁles to fully exploit the data of a full HPLC – UV chromatographic matrix. The chromatographic UV-traces at selected wave- lengths are present at the time axis and a UV spectrum is present at a speciﬁc retention time. The full data matrix can be visualized as a chemical image of the sample and can also be used for identifying the metabolites  Nielsen et al. 1998; 1999; Thrane et al. 2001 .  identiﬁcation without  fungal  Figure 5 shows that quite different looking chromatograms can be obtained from the same sample by selecting different wavelengths. This feature can be used to enhance the chromatographic resolution and to ﬁnd speciﬁc metabolites, e.g., viomellein is at 18.69 minutes on the 400 nm trace in Figure 5 and overlaps with puberuline at 18.40 minutes on the 220 nm trace. These traces are all proﬁles of the sample and as such can be used alone or in combination, or to aid speciﬁc detection. As quantitative detection is based on Beers law it is necessary to use the same wavelength for quantifying standards and unknowns for each compound but it is not necessary to use the same wavelength for different compounds.  Identiﬁcation or characterization of compounds can be achieved from UV spectra if the compound has a characteristic chromophore structure  bond structure typical containing p- electrons systems , e.g., xanthomegnin, which is two anthraquinone systems, has a chromophore giving an absorption maximum around 410 nm. This is fortunately the case for many fungal metabolites but not for all  Cole and Cox 1981 . The combination of retention time or preferably the retention index and a characteristic UV spectrum is quite reliable for identiﬁcation of many fungal metabolites  Frisvad and Thrane 1987; 1993 , however standards are needed for conﬁrmation. The use of UV-spectra in combination with other detectors, e.g., FLD can greatly enhance the speciﬁcity.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   Figure 5 The HPLC-UV data matrix showing both information about composition in form of chromatographic traces and structural information in form of UV spectra. Analysis of a plug extract from Penicillium cyclopium, IBT 16932, grown on CYA collecting approx. one spectrum sec, with a resolution of 4 nm.  For identifying fungi, it is not necessary to know the identity of all of the components in a chromatographic proﬁle. If a peak has unique features in terms of retention time  index and chromophore it can be designated with a code and used along with the metabolites known from a particular species. The most efﬁcient identiﬁcation can be done if metabolites are grouped in chromophore families  known and unknown compounds , as compounds with similar UV spectra often belong to the same bio-synthetic pathway. Therefore, if just one member of a chromophore family is present it can be used as indication of that particular pathway is active in a fungus.  3.2.1 Case I. Ochratoxin A Determination in  Aspergillus niger  Ochratoxins can easily be detected in the two penicillia, P. nordicum and P. verrucosum as well as in A. ochraceus and Petromyces alliaceus where they are good species markers. They can be detected using HPLC with UV detection with full scan UV spectral conﬁrmation. However, in the A. niger  complex, the two ochratoxin producing species A. niger  only 6% of the isolates produces ochratoxins  and A. carbonarius produce many interfering components that elute across the whole chromatogram  Figure 6  and obscures ochratoxin detection. The FLD gives a very high speciﬁcity and sensitivity  1 – 20 pg on column , with the possibility of obtaining full scan ﬂuorescence spectra. This is illustrated in Figure 6 where an A. niger isolate has been analyzed by HPLC with simultaneous UV and FLD, ochratoxins A and B are hidden in the UV chromatograms under peaks of tetracyclic components. The simultaneous detection of all ochratoxin analogues  a, b, A and B  serves as an extra conﬁrmation.  3.3 Gas Chromatography and GC – MS  Gas chromatography  GC  can be used to analyze volatiles directly and numerous after trichothecenes, amino acids, sugars, derivatization, e.g.,  semivolatile  components  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   Figure 6 Extract from an Aspergillus niger isolate analysed by HPLC-DAD-FLD. Ochratoxin A, B, a, and b, are easily seen in the lower ﬂuorescence trace  ex. 230 nm, em. 450 nm  with the ﬂuorescence spectra of ochratoxin A and a inserted. In the upper UV trace  210 nm , several tetracyclic compounds  UV spectra inserted  obscure the detection of Ochratoxin A, B, and a.  lipids, and sterols. The advantage of GC is its very high separation power in comparison to HPLC and its relative ease of operation. Furthermore, GC is easily interfaced to MS  GC – MS  or other spectral detectors, forming a powerful tool that can both deliver high separation power and give structural information in one run.  The most important step in GC is the injection, which if performed poorly can have a severe effect on the separation power. The most commonly used techniques for liquids are split, splitless, on-column injection, thermal adsorption of trapped volatiles, and headspace  Grob 1993 . Currently fused silica columns for gas – liquid chromatography are used due to the high resolution power which is needed to separate complex mixtures of volatiles such as mono- and sesquiterpenes. Different stationary phases as well as ﬁlm thickness can be chosen depending on the polarity and volatility of the compounds to be separated. More volatile compounds require a thicker ﬁlm column, whereas high separation power is best obtained by thin ﬁlm columns  Grob 1993 .  The mass spectrometer can be used to:  a  provide structural information from fragmentation in electron impact ionisation  EI  easily searched in databases,  b  accurate mass using the modern time-of-ﬂight  TOF  instrument, or  c  using ion-traps  or multistage MS – MS instruments  as very high selectivity detectors  or to get very detailed fragmentation  information . Both TOF and MS – MS instrumentation greatly increases the capability of the instruments, and the metabolite proﬁles that can be obtained from these instruments are generally not needed for fungal identiﬁcation and they are therefore not discussed further.  For metabolite proﬁling, the most important detection method is MS which in many cases will give a molecular ion  and thereby molecular mass  and a characteristic fragmenta- tion pattern—the mass spectrum—from each compound eluting from the column. The limitations of MS in the identiﬁcation of unknowns can be an insufﬁcient information content of the mass spectrum to stereo and positional isomers in aromatic systems  Ramaswami et al. 1986 . A great potential for MS is the ability to scan for a selected number of characteristic ions—selected ion recording  SIR or SIM  which can improve detection sensitivity from the ng level to the pg levels.  Flame ionization detection  FID  is an important and robust GC detector, which basically detects carbon atoms in the sample with high sensitivity and over a large dynamic range, but with no structural information. If metabolite proﬁles are compared on two different columns of substantially different polarity, similarity in the retention times of metabolites on these two columns can be used for their indirect identiﬁcation  Davies 1990 .  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   Fourier transform infrared spectrometry  FTIR , can be used to detect compounds eluting from GC columns. Most functional groups, in particular the carbonyl group  CvO , have a unique absorption  ﬁngerprint  from vibration energy. The FTIR will therefore give an unambiguous identiﬁcation of functionality of the functional groups of compounds and it is possible to identify these by comparing spectra to those of known authentic compounds. The method is nondestructive and can therefore be used in combination with either FID or MS. GC–FTIR will often allow discrimination between structural- and stereo-isomers making the method a very powerful supplement to GC–MS. The major drawback of GC– FTIR is a lower sensitivity compared to GC-FID and GC-MS.  3.3.1 Case II: Volatile Metabolites for Identiﬁcation  Of Penicillia  Volatile metabolites are believed to play an important role in chemical interactions between fungi and other organisms. Recently the total volatile proﬁle of the endophytic fungus Muscodor albus was demonstrated to effectively inhibit or kill a number of other fungi and bacteria  Strobel et al. 2001 . In general volatile production is correlated with spore formation ﬁtting well with a chemical ecological point of view. The insects, often adapted to the toxic metabolites produced by the fungi, can act as vectors for fungal spores for their further spread.  Figure 7 Chromatograms showing proﬁles of volatile sesquiterpenes produced by Penicillium roqueforti  IBT 16403  and P. carneum   IBT 6884 . The two compounds produced in largest amounts by P. roqueforti are b-elemene and  þ  -aristolochene, whereas the three  largest peaks in the P. carneum chromatogram represents geosmin, an unknown sesquiterpene and dodecanoic acid methyl ester.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   Some important studies have shown that the production of some possibly species-speciﬁc sesquiterpenes could be related to the production of important mycotoxins such as aﬂatoxins  Zeringue et al. 1993  and trichothecenes  Jelen et al. 1995 . Often fungal metabolites are only present in particular compartments of the organism such as in the conidia  or sclerotia , and these may have a role in protecting them against being eaten by other organisms. Microfungi such as the penicillia usually produce a species-speciﬁc set of volatile metabolites  Larsen 1998; Larsen and Frisvad 1995a . Often even very closely species such as P. roqueforti and P. carneum  Figures 7 and 8  can easily be differentiated by the volatiles they produce.  Fungal volatile metabolites include small ketones, alcohols, esters, and hydrocarbons such as small alkenes, mono- and sesquiterpenes. The latter are by far the most relevant metabolites for identiﬁcation purposes or for use as biomarkers  Larsen and Frisvad 1995b . The major sesquiterpenes produced by P. roqueforti are b-elemene, selenine, and patchuline  Larsen and Frisvad 1995b  together with aristolochene  Figure 8 , recently reported by Demyttenaere et al.  2002 .  In general P. carneum produces relatively lower amounts of sesquiterpenes than P. roqueforti, however, the species has a much more pronounced moldy odor than P. roqueforti due to the production of the moldy smelling compound geosmin together with large amounts of isopentanol  not shown in Figure 8 .  It should be emphasized that the production of some volatile compounds is strongly related to medium compo- sition, e.g., lipid degradation of fat rich media leads to the production of ketones and secondary alcohols, as seen in Camembert and especially Blue cheese production. The NIST and Wiley MS databases contains many spectra of mono- and sesquiterpenes  generated a 70 eV  for identiﬁcation of single  Figure 8 Structures of the main fungal terpene metabolites obtained from the headspaces of Pencillium roqueforti and geosmin produced by P. carneum. 1  Limonene 2  b-elemene 3  g-patchulene 4  b-caryopyllene 5  b-myrcene 6  aristolochene 7  a-selinene 8  geosmin.   þ  -  compounds, and a lot of spectral information can also be found in the atlas of Joulian and Ko¨nig  1998 . A good review of methods for the identiﬁcation of sesquiterpenes can be found in Ko¨nig et al.  1999 .  As mentioned in Section 3, the sensitivity can be greatly enhanced by the use of SIR, and the method has been used together with SPME to investigate how early volatile metabolites can be detected  Larsen 1997 . The SIR of four to seven of the most characteristic ions of mainly sesquiterpenes from cheese-associated fungi allowed the identiﬁcation to species level within two days, at which time they had not started to sporulate and were only white mycelia. Volatiles from a mixed culture of P. roqueforti and P. commune, inoculated in a ratio of 1000:1, could be used to detect both fungi within three days, showing the possibility of checking starter cultures for cross-contamination.  3.4 Atmospheric Pressure Ionization MS  The last decade has seen a tremendous development in biological MS, and it is currently one of the fastest growing analytical techniques in biotechnology.  The MS is the determination of the mass to charge ratio of charged species of molecules or highly speciﬁc fragments of these  as in GC – MS . These can be either positively charged or negatively charged. In the atmospheric pressure ionization  API  LC – MS techniques, ions are formed at atmospheric pressure and transferred into the vacuum of the mass analyzer. There are two predominant ionization techniques: Electro- spray ionization  ESI ; and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization  APCI . In ESI the eluant from the column is sprayed though a narrow bore capillary to which a high voltage is applied  around 3 kV . This will produce a spray of highly charged droplets. The solvent is evaporated from the droplets by a heated gas, leading to shrinkage and disintegration to charged species through a complex process. The ions are formed either in the solvent before spraying or during the spray droplet shrinkage and the key parameters inﬂuencing the ion production are: solvent composition  surface tension, volatility, modiﬁers, pH, ion strength , source parameters  temperature, drying gas ﬂow, potential , and interaction between analytes in the sample  Berkel 2000 . The charged species are then sampled into the vacuum of the mass analyzer.  In APCI the eluant from the HPLC column is sprayed through a co-axial capillary with a heated gas to evaporate the solvent. Evaporated solvent molecules are ionized by a corona discharge from a needle that is usually placed across the sampling oriﬁce. Analyte molecules are ionized by chemical reaction in the gas phase at atmospheric pressure through a process much like the classical chemical ionization. The ions are sampled into the mass analyzer by a process similar to ESI  see Table 2 .  In general, ESI is the most versatile technique for a very broad range of bio-molecules and also the easiest to use, therefore ESI is also the most frequently used technique.

Gas phase chemistry is however not like solvent chemistry, and many carboxylic acids are much more efﬁciently protonated in gas phase by positive ESI than determined as anions in negative ESI. Negative ESI will give many fewer adducts and clusters than positive ESI, see Table 3, and so it is therefore easier to interpret spectra. However, a higher sensitivity can be obtained for some classes of compounds in APCI than in ESI.  The charge to mass ratio is determined using a mass analyzer, which is either: Quadrupol, time of ﬂight  TOF , ion-trap, sector  electric and magnetic  or an ion-cyclotron  ICR . These analyzers can be grouped into scanning analyzers  mass ﬁlters  where ions of just one mass to charge ratio can pass at a time and nonscanning analyzers where all ions entering the analyzer are detected  Table 4 . Mass resolution and accuracy are the two most important factors for the identiﬁcation of compounds whereas sensitivity and scan speed are of most chromatographic importance.  Accurate mass determination relies on both sufﬁcient resolution to separate isotopes and a very stable mass to  Table 3 Quasi-molecular ions are often seen along with adducts in a low mass positive electrospray mass spectrum. This is highly solvent and parameter dependent. Very few adducts and clusters are seen in negative ESI  Charging by Solvent adducts Dimers Multiple charged  Fragments Others  Adducts  þ  þ , Na  þ H , K H2O, CH3OH, CH3CN 2M þ H þ þ  , 2M þ H3O  , 2M þ Na þ  Double charged is rarely seen below mass 800 – 1000 Da e  – H2O, Fe, Zn, and other metal    þ Fe3þ þ H3CCOO  complexes are sometime seen e.g. þ  M 2 H þ ions can be seen from some types of compounds  2  M  charge determination. The performance of two common mass analyzers is shown in Figure 9. The TOF analyzer raw data  often called a continuum spectrum  show a resolution of approx 7500  half height  and the quadrupole approx 900  half height . Mass spectra are normally used as centroid  stick  spectra for mass determination where the stick is placed at the center of the continuum peak. This also reduces the disk space needed to store the spectra.  Formula can be calculated from the mass, and with sufﬁcient mass accuracy the number of possible structures is limited if sensible limits for composition are applied  Table 5 . Combining a mass spectrometer with HPLC will allow the recording of mass spectra as peaks are eluted from the column. As was the case collecting UV-spectra, mass spectra are collected continuously with about 10 – 20 spectra across a peak to produce a data matrix containing both chromatographic and mass spectral information see Figure 10.  Ion traces are highly speciﬁc chromatographic proﬁles of the samples which depend on the mass accuracy. Figure 10 shows an example of high accuracy ion traces corresponding to the protonated mass of puberuline  444.2287 Da  and xanthomegnin  575.1187 Da  both using a window width of 15 ppm  6.7 8.7 mDa  showing only one peak in each; compare this to Figure 5. For each peak a mass spectrum can be retrieved, given structural information about the sample. In this case using an accurate TOF mass spectrometer also gives an estimate of peak formula. Comparing the HPLC-MS image in Figure 10 to the HPLC-UV image in Figure 5 there are signiﬁcantly more details and higher speciﬁcity in the former of these two. The data shown on Figures 5 and 10 were acquired during the same run using a nondestructive UV detector in series with the MS to give the maximum information.  There are some restrictions on the use of HPLC-MS which depend on the ionization techniques: the eluants must be volatile including modiﬁers  e.g., acids , the ﬂow rate must be suitable for the interface and modiﬁers ion strength must  match the ionization technique  ESI þ  2 or APCI þ  2  . In  general, most reversed phase chromatographic solvent systems can be used, e.g., water, acetonitrile, and methanol with the modiﬁers acetic acid, formic acid, and ammonium  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

However, triﬂuoroacetic acid should particularly be avoided in APCI  both positive and negative , whereas it can be used in low concentration in positive ESI. It is very difﬁcult to run ESI in pure organic solvent due to volatility, and the limit seems to be around 90 – 95% acetonitrile-water, however ACPI works well in a pure organic solvent.  Metabolite proﬁling by HPLC – MS  ESI or APCI  are very efﬁcient tools for identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of fungi. As the speciﬁcity is very high, rapid chromatographic methods can be used. If a list of expected ions can be made, then the  Table 5 Number of structures possible for mass 444.230 Da with different mass accuracies  fungal  identiﬁcation.  ion traces corresponding to these can easily be drawn. It is then a simple matter to interpret. In most cases it is not necessary to use high resolution accurate mass spectrometers for identiﬁcation, a combination of several metabolites with different retention time is used as a mark for each species thereby limiting the number of misidentiﬁcations. However it may be necessary to use more than one ionization technique, as some components are difﬁcult to ionize in positive ESI.  In practical  If the goal is to get a full proﬁle of all metabolites produced under speciﬁc conditions for metabolomics, then high resolution accurate mass determination is a major advantage, as it also provides the molecular composition of the ions.

This approach was used by Smedsgaard in a study of the terverticilllate penicillia  Smedsgaard 1997b; Smedsgaard and Frisvad 1997 . In that study, crude plug extracts from cultures were injected directly into the mass spectrometer in positive ESI mode with solvent and other parameters optimized to minimize fragmentation and cluster. Samples were used at low concentration to reduce matrix effects, thus avoiding “the winner takes it all effect.” About 10 – 15 samples can be analyzed per hour by this approach, which have recently been used to study other organisms such as bacteria  Vaidyanathan et al. 2002  and actinomycetes  Higgs et al. 2001 .  Nine of the major species in the Penicillium series Viridicata  The Penicillium aurantiogriseum complex  were analyzed by direct injection on a quadrupole mass spectrometer  Smedsgaard and Frisvad 1996 . Figure 11 shows crude extract spectra from three different species cultivated on CYA  Samson et al. 2000 . The spectra show signiﬁcant difference between the species and ions corre- sponding to the protonated mass of major known metabolites. These spectra can be stored and searched in a spectral database using the software included with most instruments, although this software in general is designed for EI spectra  Smedsgaard 1997b . To prove the concept in more detail a cluster analysis of the full centroid mass spectra  normalized  the nine major Penicillium series from 45 isolates of Viridicata species  Figure 12  was performed. This cluster analysis is done directly on the centroid spectra with 1 Da  resolution using the correlation coefﬁcient and UPGMA linkage.  As it can be seen from Figure 12 most species cluster together, however P. aurantiocandium is found in the P. cyclopium and P. tricolor clusters. One P. viridicatum is grouped with P. aurantiogriseum and another is an outlier.  The ions   metabolites   that are important  to the segregation of the species can be found using Principle Component Analysis  PCA  as the PCA loadings  Figure 13 . If we consider loadings above 0.04 or below 2 0.04, 47 ions are found in the plot from the ﬁrst three principal components. Of these, 15 ions correspond to the protonated ions from 15 of the most important metabolites produced by these species  out of about 28 metabolites . Furthermore ﬁve ions correspond to the 13C isotope of major metabolites. Five to six characteristic metabolites are not found as they are not produced on these media, however they can be seen in the mass spectra from some of the known producers. Four ions of unknown structure are found from the loadings plot at mass 205, 235, 243, and 274 Da.  signiﬁcant  3.5 A Combined Approach: The Agar Plug-TLC  Method  The agar plug method was ﬁrst introduced as a taxonomic tool for Penicillium in 1983  Frisvad and Filtenborg 1983 .  þ Figure 11 ESI  mass spectra from injection of crude extracts of three Penicillium isolates.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   Figure 12 Cluster analysis of 45 mass spectra from direct infusion ESI þ MS of crude culture extracts of Penicillium species.  Calculated using correlation coefﬁcient and UPGMA linkage.  The method uses a combined extraction—TLC analysis, where the extraction is done by adding a drop of solvent on top of a small plug cut from a colony. After a few seconds, the solvent remaining on top of the colony is applied to a TLC  plate by gently pressing the wetted side down on the plate. The advantage of the method is that it is simple, cheap equipment is required, sample throughput is high, and with many groups of fungi can be identiﬁed as illustrated on Penicillium series Viridicata  the P. aurantiogriseum complex  later. In the general Penicillium procedure plugs from CYA media are examined for intracellular metabolites, whereas the plugs from YES are examined for extra-cellular metabolites. A normal 20 by 20 cm plate accommodate 21 lanes from each side, and so 10 isolates can be analyzed  Figure 14 .  The TLC plates are eluted in saturated chambers, dried and examined in daylight and under UV light  366 nm and 254 nm  and spots appearing are noted  color, shape, etc. . The spots are marked gently with a pencil  or the plate is photographed . This procedure is repeated after: the whole plate is sprayed with AlCl3 and heated at 1308C for 8 minutes; the CAP side is sprayed with Ce SO4 2; the TEF side is sprayed with ANIS and heated at 130 8C for 8 minutes.

A 3 mm plug is cut from a colony and is placed directly on the TLC plate with the agar side down for the extra cellular metabolites or a drop of solvent is added to the mycelium side and the plug is placed with the wetted side down. The plate is eluted in two systems and the dried plate is examined under UV light before and after spraying.  3.5.1 Case IV: Identiﬁcation of Cereal Borne  Penicillia by TLC  Cereals represent a habitat with a limited associated funga, and it is relatively easy to determine Penicillium species when kernels are placed on DG18  Dichloran 18% Glycerol agar , DRYES  Dichloran Rose Bengal Yeast Extract agar  or DYSG  Dichloran Yeast Extract 18% Glycerol agar . When the Penicillium species are isolated and inoculated in 3-points on the identiﬁcation media CYA, MEA  Malt extract agar , YES, and CREA  Creatine Sucrose agar   Samson et al. 2000  it is relatively easy to observe that on MEA, most isolates have two stage branched rough  terverticillate  and smooth conidia  excluding stipes P. hordei , and that growth is inhibited on CREA. At this stage it is not possible to make a deﬁnite identiﬁcation as these criteria ﬁt with the following nine Penicillium species found on cereals: P. aurantiogriseum, P. freii, aurantiocandidum, P. cyclopium, P. melanoconidium P.  Penicillium series Viridicata , verrucosum  Penicillium series Verrucosa . Agar plugs from twenty isolates on CYA and YES can be applied on a TLC plate   20 £ 20 cm  within 30 min, and the plate developed in TEF  tricolor, P. viridicatum, P.  polonicum, P.  and P.   Figure 14 .  The two secondary metabolites xanthomegnin and viomel- lein are always seen simultaneously as two brown spots under visible light in samples from CYA, and reduces the number of possible species to four, i.e. only four cereal-borne Penicillium species  Table 6 . Aurantiamine, 3-methoxyviridicatin, bre-  and  viomellein  identiﬁes P.  vianamide A, viridamine, ochratoxin A, and citrinin are visible as colored spots under UV light  365 nm , usually in highest quantities on CYA. Aurantiamine and viridamine are both seen as blue spots, however viridamine is more light blue and has a lower Rf than aurantiamine. Viridamine will identify the fungus as P. viridicatum, and can be conﬁrmed by the presence of brevianamide A as a yellow spot. Aurantiamine can be produced by two species, but simultaneously detection of 3-methoxyviridicatin as a blue spot under 255 nm light, and freii. xanthomegnin P. verrucosum is identiﬁed by a tailing yellow spot of citrinin and a blue green spot of ochratoxin A. The TLC plate should then be sprayed with AlCl3 and then heated at 1308C for 8 minutes. Penitrem A is the visible as a bluish black spot in daylight and oxaline as a yellow brown spot very close to the application point. If both metabolites are present on CYA the fungus is P. melanoconidium. The TLC plate should then be spayed with ANIS and heated to 1308C for 8 minutes. In cultures from YES yellow tailing spots in daylight identify terrestric acid that in combination with aurantiamine deﬁnitely identify the isolate as P. aurantiogriseum. A yellow brown spot under UV light on CYA detects verrucosidin, which in combination with 3-methoxyviridicatin identiﬁes P. polonicum. P. tricolor is identiﬁed as producer of terrestric acid, xanthomegnin and viomellein. Except P. tricolor and P. verrucosum all these species produce penicillic acid seen as a bluish red spot under UV light after ANIS spray. In summary eight of nine species can be identiﬁed solely based on TLC results the species, P. aurantiocandidum cannot be however  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

Some of these methods are best used for unsupervised classiﬁcation approaches such as cluster analysis, multidimensional scaling, correspondence analysis, and PCA, whereas other methods such as Partial Least Squares Discriminant  PLS-D  analysis and soft independent modeling of class analogy  SIMCA  are more suited for discriminant analysis and identiﬁcation  Frisvad 1994b; So¨derstro¨m and Frisvad 1984 . The immense quantities of data collected by modern analytic instruments dictates some form of automatic data handling and analysis  Nielsen et al. 1999  although problems such as handling of simultaneous UV, MS, and nuclear magnetic resonance data without component identiﬁcation needs to be solved, as well as issues relating to the storage in searchable databases, and how data can be combined with other biodiversity information.  4 CONCLUSION AND SUGGESTIONS  Proﬁles of secondary metabolites provide powerful tools for fungal identiﬁcation and can give insight in very large parts of the fungal genome, in addition of being functional and ecological characters. Metabolite proﬁling is currently being revolutionized by developments in MS as well as chemo- metrics and data handling which is necessary to cope with the immense quantities of data collected  @ 1 Gb day . Chemical characters can be used directly in synoptic keys. They are also very suitable for databases as they can be accurately recorded using speciﬁc chemical methods. Natural classi- ﬁcations are often based on a polyphasic approach, where ideally many different ecologically relevant characters should be used.

Goodwin U.S. Department of Agriculture—Agricultural Research Service, and Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA  1  INTRODUCTION  Isozyme analysis is a powerful technique for assaying genetic variation within and among populations. This versatile approach has been used on bacteria, fungi, plants, and most major groups of animals, from insects and other invertebrates to ﬁsh and mammals. The appeal of isozyme analysis stems from its ease of use, low cost, and speed. DNA-based technologies can provide a higher level of polymorphism with concomitantly greater resolution. However, when sufﬁcient variation is present, isozymes provide the fastest, easiest answers to biological questions at a signiﬁcantly lower cost compared to other available techniques.  Isozyme analysis has a long history in the fungi. Differences among general protein patterns of species of Neurospora and Pythium were ﬁrst noted during the early 1960s  Chang et al. 1962; Clare 1963 . This approach developed into isozyme analysis with the application of methods for detection of speciﬁc enzyme activities. Since the mid 1960s, the technique has been applied to questions of fungal taxonomy, genetics, population biology, and species or strain identiﬁcation  Micales et al. 1986; 1992  but it is only during the past 15 years that the true potential of the technique has been realized.  The purpose of this chapter is to introduce the concept of isozyme analysis in fungi. Strategies for developing new isozyme systems and for addressing particular questions about fungal taxonomy, genetics, and population biology will be discussed. Particular emphasis will be placed on identifying common pitfalls and barriers to successful implementation of new isozyme systems, especially inter- pretation of banding patterns, preparation of tissue samples, and methods and approaches to data analysis. Speciﬁc  examples of isozyme analysis for the major groups of fungi will be discussed to illustrate the many potential applications of this extremely useful and powerful technique.  2 WHAT IS AN ISOZYME?  Isozymes are different forms of a single enzyme that perform the same or similar function. Each form has some small change that allows it to be distinguished from other forms  isozymes  of the same enzyme. The changes usually result from point mutations in the DNA that cause single amino-acid substitutions into the protein making up the enzyme. Changes that affect the charge or size of the ﬁnal enzyme may alter its mobility in an electric ﬁeld. Such changes often can be detected by electrophoresis, and this forms the basis for isozyme analysis.  The terms “isozyme” and “allozyme” often are used interchangeably and can be a source of great confusion. However, the terms are not identical. Isozymes that have been analyzed genetically and are known to be alleles at a single genetic locus can be called allozymes. Therefore, all allozymes are also isozymes, but not all isozymes are allozymes. Isozyme is a more general term and should be used unless the genetic basis of the different enzyme forms is known for certain.  3  ISOZYME TECHNIQUES FOR FUNGI AND OOMYCETES  Many methods have been developed for separating enzyme variants and visualizing isozyme variation. The basic  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   approach is to obtain crude extracts of total soluble proteins, separate the proteins by electrophoresis through some type of solid matrix  usually a gel , then visualize the isozymes by use of chemicals that produce a visual reaction in response to speciﬁc enzyme activity. General methods of isozyme analysis have been described elsewhere  Selander et al. 1971; Shaw and Prasad 1970; Soltis et al. 1983  and will not be repeated here. However, aspects of isozyme analysis that are speciﬁc to fungi will be discussed brieﬂy. Additional information can be found in previous reviews of isozyme analysis and compilations of recipes speciﬁcally adapted for fungi  Micales et al. 1986 .  3.1 Types of Tissue and Preparation of Samples  for Isozyme Analysis of Fungi  Fortunately, virtually any type of fungal tissue can be used for isozyme analysis. This could include sections of sporocarps collected in the ﬁeld or produced in culture, mycelia from plates or liquid cultures, or even conidia washed from lesions or cultures. The main requirement is that the tissue must be living so the enzymes are functional. Old cultures that are dead or dying will not give satisfactory results. This precludes dried herbarium material as the activity of most enzymes will be destroyed during the drying process. However, living material that has been lyophilized and stored at 2 808C will maintain enzyme activity for many months and possibly for years. Lyophilization also may be a good option to save material until a sufﬁcient quantity is available for analysis if only limited amounts of material can be collected at a time. Regardless of source or amount, the fungal material must be macerated to release the enzymes. Lyophilized material can be frozen quickly with a small quantity of liquid nitrogen and ground in a mortar after the nitrogen has evaporated. Small amounts of tissue can be ground in microcentrifuge tubes using a glass rod as a pestle. Disposable plastic pestles designed speciﬁcally for use in microcentrifuge tubes also can be used. Fresh tissue can be crushed with a disposable plastic pestle attached to a variable-speed electric drill. Adhering liquid and tissue should be wiped from the pestle between samples, but there is no need to clean the pestle completely as  Figure 1 Isozymes of glucose-6-phosphate isomerase in 12 isolates of the barley scald pathogen, Rhynchosporium secalis. This haploid fungus yields a single band in each lane corresponding to one of the three putative alleles 87, 100, or 114.  a small amount of cross contamination will not affect the results due to the relatively low sensitivity of the technique. To maintain enzyme activity, all samples should be kept on ice whenever possible. Tissue extracts also can be frozen at 2 808C for several weeks if necessary with little or no enzyme degradation. However, this should be tested for each system speciﬁcally before used on a large number of samples.  3.2 Choice of Separation Matrix  Gels of 12% hydrolyzed potato starch have been the mainstay of isozyme analysis for decades, Advantages are cost and throughput. A single starch gel can yield 3 – 4 horizontal slices  possibly more , each of which can be stained for a different enzyme. Depending on the size of the ﬁlter-paper wicks used for sample loading and the width of the gel, 20 – 50 or more samples can be loaded per gel. Thus, more than 200 data points  50 individuals times four enzymes  can be obtained per gel once the system is optimized, and an average of 80 or more is common. This high sample capacity is excellent for population genetics analyses that require large sample sizes for meaningful conclusions. Starch gels can be photographed easily for a permanent record.  A newer approach is to use precast cellulose-acetate plates obtained from commercial suppliers. This technique has been used for many years in medical diagnostics but has only been applied to isozyme analysis in general since the mid 1980s  Hebert and Beaton 1993 . Advantages of cellulose acetate are that the pre-cast gels can be purchased ahead of time and stored dry until needed, so there is no time, effort, or skill involved in pouring the gels; specially designed gel boxes and sample applicators can be purchased so a laboratory can be set up quickly; and the complete analysis can be run in an hour from start to ﬁnish, so many runs can be completed in the same day. Very small volumes are needed so extremely small amounts of tissue can be analyzed. The stained gels can be photographed or the gels themselves dried and saved for a permanent record.  Isozymes also can be separated on many other types of solid matrix and approach, such as polyacrylamide gels or using isoelectric focusing. Polyacrylamide in particular is often used in an attempt to gain increased resolution. Although these systems often do reveal additional bands, the banding patterns can be difﬁcult to interpret genetically. Furthermore, throughput and ease of use are lower, and costs often are higher compared to starch and cellulose acetate.  3.3 Enzyme Activity Staining  Once the proteins have been separated on a gel, a set of staining protocols must be followed to reveal the isozymes. Speciﬁc enzyme activity staining is what makes isozyme analysis possible. Recipes and techniques for staining hundreds of enzyme activities are provided in numerous compilations  Micales et al. 1986; Selander et al. 1971; Shaw  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   and Prasad 1970; Soltis et al. 1983  and are beyond the purview of this chapter. However, a brief description of the major types of staining systems is provided here. Three staining systems are used commonly for isozyme analysis: positive, negative, and ﬂuorescent. The vast majority of isozyme visualization systems are based on positive staining. The general idea is that activity of a speciﬁc enzyme generates a colored precipitate at zones of enzyme activity. These isozymes are visualized as dark bands against a light background  Figure 1 . Negatively stained isozymes are visible as light-colored bands against a dark gel. Common negative staining systems include those for the enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase. A third class of enzyme staining system works by generating bands that ﬂuoresce when exposed to ultraviolet light. Commonly used ﬂuorescent staining systems include those for arylesterase and b-glucosidase.  4  INTERPRETATION OF ISOZYME DATA  The best guide for interpreting isozyme banding patterns is to perform a thorough genetic analysis. Unfortunately, for many fungi this may be difﬁcult or impossible. The purpose of this section is to provide enough information for accurate interpretation of isozyme banding patterns even without a genetic analysis. Accurate interpretation of isozyme banding patterns requires knowledge of the ploidy of the organism and the number of subunits required to form the active enzyme. Most enzymes should give a relatively simple banding pattern with only one to three bands per individual  Figure 1 . Enzymes with relatively nonspeciﬁc stains  e.g., esterases   Figure 2 Subunits with 2 2 and 2 3 charges combine at random to form an active dimeric enzyme. A, In this example, random combination of subunits yields three dimers with total charges of 2 4, 2 5, and 2 6 in a ratio of 1:2:1. B, The pattern that results on a gel after electrophoresis and staining. Direction of migration is indicated by the arrow.  often give complicated banding patterns that are difﬁcult or impossible to interpret without a genetic analysis. Unless crosses can be made easily those systems are best avoided.  4.1  Interpretation of Isozyme Banding Patterns in Haploids  For haploid fungi, each individual ideally will produce a single band on a gel. Such isozymes can be scored easily by assuming that each band corresponds to an allele at a single genetic locus. Each allele can be named by indicating its relative migration distance on the gel. The easiest approach is to designate the most common allele as number 100. Then all other alleles can be indicated by their migration distance relative to the 100 allele. For example, an allele migrating 14% faster than allele 100 would be allele 114, and one migrating 13% slower would be allele 87  Figure 1 .  More than one band per haploid individual may indicate multiple loci. If alleles at each locus migrate within a limited, deﬁned region of the gel then it may be possible to score each locus separately. Alleles at each locus can be named as indicated previously but with a locus designation, e.g., Gpi-1 100 and Gpi-2 100 to indicate the 100 alleles at two loci coding for the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate isomerase. Enzymes giving more complicated banding patterns in haploids should be avoided as accurate interpretation is almost impossible without thorough genetic analysis. “Null” alleles—those in which no enzyme activity is detected— should be regarded with suspicion as it to distinguish a null allele from a null caused by faulty technique. Furthermore, it is difﬁcult to imagine a haploid being truly null for important enzyme activities. All potential null alleles should be veriﬁed thoroughly—most probably will turn out to be errors caused by poor enzyme extraction from particular individuals or other problems with technique.  is difﬁcult  4.2  Interpretation of Isozyme Banding Patterns in Diploids, Dikaryons, and Polyploids  Interpretation of isozyme banding patterns in diploids and dikaryons is much more complicated, and is aided by knowing whether a particular enzyme is mono- or multimeric. For monomeric enzymes, homozygous diploid individuals should produce a single band on a gel as described for haploids. Diploid individuals that are heterozygous at a locus for a monomeric enzyme will give two bands in a properly stained isozyme gel following electrophoresis. Each band can be interpreted easily as a different allele at a single genetic locus. Banding patterns are more complicated for enzymes composed of two or more subunits. In these cases the subunits must join together to form the active enzyme. Because dimeric enzymes  those composed of two subunits  are the most common, they will be the subject of this discussion. However, the concepts covered here are directly applicable to  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

Other banding patterns can be produced by individuals containing three or more alleles separated by unequal charges. For example, an individual heterozygous for three alleles in uneven steps, e.g., 2 2, 2 3, and 2 5, would yield a six- banded pattern in a 1:2:1:2:2:1 ratio. Band-intensity ratios in polyploids also can be affected by the number of copies of particular alleles at a locus. For example, an individual with three alleles, two of which are identical, e.g., 2 2, 2 4, and 2 4, should give rise to a three-banded pattern in a 1:4:4 ratio. This has been documented in the US-1 genotype of P. infestans which has two copies of the 100 and one copy of the 86 allele at the Gpi locus  Goodwin et al. 1992 . Even more complicated banding patterns are produced by tetrameric enzymes and by multiple loci that share alleles. Interpretation of these patterns was covered in detail elsewhere  Micales et al. 1992 . Fortunately, most enzymes are dimeric so the principles discussed previously will apply directly. An understanding of these basic principles combined with genetic analyses should allow unambiguous interpret- ation of virtually any isozyme pattern.  4.3 Choosing Among the Available Enzyme  Systems  Every isozyme project begins with a choice of enzymes. Although it is not possible to predict which enzymes will  enzymes composed of three or more subunits. To correctly interpret isozyme banding patterns produced by dimeric enzymes, it is necessary to understand how the subunits combine to form the active enzyme. In heterozygous diploid individuals, the subunits produced by the two alleles combine at random in the cytoplasm of the cell to form the active molecule. For the hypothetical case of a diploid with two alleles, one coding for a subunit with a 2 2 charge, the other with a 2 3 charge, there are four possible ways the subunits can be joined to form the active dimer  Figure 2A . Three types of dimer can result: two homodimers  when identical subunits combine  and a heterodimer  composed of two different subunits . In Figure 2A, each 2 2 subunit can join with another 2 2 subunit  to form a 2 2 2 2 homodimer  or with a 2 3 subunit  for a 2 2 2 3 heterodimer . Similarly, half of the 2 3 subunits will pair with a 2 2 subunit and half with a 2 3 subunit. Notice that for every 2 2 2 2 homodimer  total charge ¼ 2 4  there are two 2 2 2 3 heterodimers  total charge ¼ 2 5  charge ¼ 2 6 , for a ratio of 1:2:1.  one 2 3 2 3  homodimer   total  and  When these molecules are separated according to charge in an electric ﬁeld, they will migrate to three regions on the gel, which after staining will be visualized as three distinct bands  Figure 2B . Notice that the middle  heterodimer  band is approximately twice as intense as either homodimer band, reﬂecting the 1:2:1 ratio in the numbers of each molecule. This pattern is unmistakable on isozyme gels  Figure 3 .  The pattern is slightly more complicated for trisomic or polyploid individuals possessing three alleles. In this case, the subunits pair at random as before, only now there are nine possibilities  Figure 4A . If the different alleles vary by single-step charge differences, for example with charges of 2 2, 2 3, and 2 4, then the 2 3 2 3 homodimer will have the same 2 6 charge as the 2 2 2 4 heterodimers and will migrate to the same place on the gel during electrophoresis. This will produce a ﬁve-banded phenotype in which the intensities of the bands should be in a ratio of approximately 1:2:3:2: 1  Figure 4B . This pattern is seen in the US-8 genotype of the  Figure 3 Banding patterns of glucose-6-phosphate isomerase in a diploid. Heterodimers are seen as more intensely staining bands between two other bands. The gel shows interspeciﬁc hybrids between the oomycetes Phytophthora infestans and its close relative P. mirabilis. The P. infestans parent was heterozygous 86 122and the P. mirabilis parent was homozygous l08 108. Interspeciﬁc hybrids are 86 108  lanes 1,2,4,7, and 8  or 108 122  lanes 3,5,6, and 9 . Lanes 10  homozygous 108 108  and 11  86 122  indicate self fertilization of the P. mirabilis and P. infestans parents, respectively.  Figure 4 Formation of dimers in a triploid. A, The subunits can combine nine ways to form dimers with ﬁve possible charges. B, Separating these dimers on a gel and staining gives ﬁve bands in a ratio of intensities of 1:2:3:2: 1. The most intense band results from co-migration of 2 2 2 4 and 2 3 2 3 heterodimers. All six bands could be visible if the differences in charge among alleles were uneven. Direction of migration is indicated by the arrow.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

The best approach is to screen a few isolates on a large number of enzyme systems, then choose those enzymes which give well resolved, easily storable banding patterns. However, choosing which enzymes to try ﬁrst can be daunting. Enzyme testing results from 27 published surveys plus three unpublished surveys are summarized in Table 1. Among the 82 enzymes listed, 32 never worked and another 20 were successful in less than 50% of the surveys. The most promising enzymes to try in an initial survey would be the 20 enzymes that were tried four or more times and provided useful information in 50% or more of the studies surveyed  indicated in bold in Table 1 .  5 APPLICATIONS OF ISOZYME ANALYSIS  Isozyme analysis can be applied to address a wide variety of biological questions in the fungi. These markers usually are considered to be selectively neutral so are ideal for looking at sources of inoculum for pathogenic fungi or gene ﬂow among populations. The markers can indicate whether speciﬁc tissues are haploid or diploid, can aid strain or species identiﬁcation, and can be used to identify hybridization either in the laboratory or in nature.  5.1 Taxonomy and Species Identiﬁcation  Isozyme analysis was ﬁrst applied to fungal taxonomy during the 1960s  Clare 1963; Hall 1967; Meyer et al. 1964; Peberdy and Turner 1968 . Since then it has been applied at many taxonomic levels from typing individual strains to delimita- tion and identiﬁcation of species. The best enzymes for taxonomic purposes are those that are monomorphic within but different among taxa. A caveat is that isozymes cannot be used to infer phylogenetic relationships. This is because bands with the same migration rate on a gel in fact may not be identical. Furthermore, it is not possible to infer which allele is ancestral or to estimate the number of mutations that cause the isozymes to migrate differently; alleles of similar size may be more different evolutionarily than those with larger migration distances on a gel. Therefore, clustering algorithms such as neighbor joining  Saitou and Nei 1987  that allow for unequal rates of evolution on branches are not appropriate for isozyme data. Instead, isozyme data are analyzed usually by calculating a simple distance coefﬁcient and drawing clusters with the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean  UPGMA   Michener and Sokal 1957 . These analyses can be performed with several computer programs such as NTSYSpc  Rohlf 1998 , POPGENE  http:  www.ualberta.ca  -fyeh index.htm ,  http:  evolution.genetics. washington.edu phylip.html , or PAUP*  http:  paup.csit. fsu.edu index.html . Cluster analyses always should be accompanied by bootstrap analysis or some alternative method of indicating the level of statistical support for particular groupings. Unfortunately, bootstrap analysis cannot  PHYLIP  be performed with NTSYS, but it is available with some of the other computer programs as well as the program WinBoot  Yap and Nelson 1996 .  Speciﬁc applications of isozyme analysis to taxonomic questions include identifying strains of Trichoderma harzia- num  Zamir and Chet 1985 , varieties of Verticicladiella wageneri  Otrosina and Cobb 1987 , or anastomosis groups within Rhizoctonia  Damaj et al. 1993 . The technique also can be used to identify fungal cultures to species  Six and Paine 1997 . Isozyme analyses have conﬁrmed a high level of genetic differentiation among host-associated varieties of Leptographium wageneri  Zambino and Harrington 1989  and have revealed previously unknown genetic subdivision within various species of Phytophthora  Mchau and Coffey 1994; 1995 . In the rust genus Puccinia, isozyme variation can distinguish among species and also among formae speciales on different hosts  Burdon and Marshall 1981 .  The most common use of isozyme analysis in fungal taxonomy is to divide isolates into species and to test how well biochemical species identiﬁcation corresponds to classical taxonomy. Usually, species groups identiﬁed by isozyme analysis correspond quite closely with those identiﬁed morphologically  Hsiau and Harrington 1997; Oudemans and Coffey 1991a,b; St. Leger et al. 1992; Surve- Iyer et al. 1995 . However, sometimes two or more taxa are found to be the same genetically  Oudemans and Coffey 1991b; Yoon et al. 1990  and are combined into a single species. The opposite also is a common result of isozyme analysis: single species frequently can be divided into two or more species based on previously hidden genetic differen- tiation uncovered by isozyme analyses  Altomare et al. 1997; St. Leger et al. 1992 .  5.2 Genetics  In addition to simple Mendelian genetics  Bonde et al. 1988; Burdon et al. 1986; Hellman and Christ 1991; Shattock et al. 1986a; Spielman et al. 1990  and linkage analysis  May and Royse 1982b , isozymes can be used to distinguish hybrid from nonhybrid progeny in both intra-  May and Royse 1982a; Shattock et al. 1986b  and inter-speciﬁc crosses  Goodwin and Fry 1994 , and to infer the ploidy level of vegetative hyphae  Goodwin et al. 1994; Shattock et al. 1986b . Dimeric enzymes are ideal for this kind of analysis  Figure 3 . Isozymes also can be used to analyze parasexual genetics in fungi. In addition to laboratory genetics, isozyme analysis implicated somatic hybridization as the probable origin of a new forma specialis of cereal rust in Australia  Burdon et al. 1981  and identiﬁed naturally occurring hybrids among ﬁeld isolates of Phytophthora species  Man in ‘t Veld et al. 1998 . Estimates of relatedness based on isozyme analysis among strains of Agaricus brunnescens were used to aid the choice of parents in a mushroom breeding program  Royse and May 1982b .

It is important to remember that no isozyme should be referred to as an allozyme until a proper genetic analysis has been completed.  5.3 Population Biology  Gene ﬂow is the movement of individuals among populations and can be estimated indirectly through isozyme analysis as the number of migrants per generation  Slatkin and Barton 1989  or by analysis of “private” alleles—those limited to a single species or population. Different species usually have highly differentiated allele frequencies and a higher number of private alleles compared to individuals from a single panmictic population. The computer program POPGENE, among others, can perform this type of analysis.  Applications of isozyme analysis to epidemiology have included monitoring the spread of speciﬁc genotypes of Phytophthora infestans  Goodwin et al. 1995; Legard and Fry 1996 , determining the inﬂuence of various evolutionary forces on the composition of inoculated populations of the barley scald pathogen Rhynchosporium secalis  Goodwin et al. 1994 , and estimating the size of and boundaries between individuals of the puffball Lycoperdon pyriforme on decaying logs  Huss 1993 .  The ﬁrst real attempt to use isozymes to analyze the genetic structure of fungal populations was for Neurospora intermedia by Spieth  1975 . That analysis revealed a high level of genetic variation within but low differentiation among populations. Spieth’s pioneering work was followed by additional studies within a decade and this has accelerated during the 1990s. Many of these studies have had similar results and demonstrated high gene diversity within but low differentiation among populations of a wide diversity of fungi  Andrews et al. 1988; Goodwin et al. 1993; Huss 1996; Tuskan et al. 1990 . Other authors have found varying degrees of subdivision among populations, usually among host-associated forms  Harvey et al. 2001; Leuchtmann and Clay 1989; 1990  and, more rarely, among physiological races  Welz et al. 1994 .  Gene ﬂow analysis of isozyme markers also can indicate when taxa have become sufﬁciently isolated reproductively to be considered separate species. Existence of separate species was shown conclusively for several closely related groups in the genus Phytophthora  Goodwin et al. 1999; Man in ‘t Veld et al. 2002; Nygaard et al. 1989  which could not have been discovered without the use of molecular markers. A similar approach identiﬁed distinct biological species within the mushroom Pleurotus eryngii  Urbanelli et al. 2002 .  Isozyme analyses of some populations of fungi and oomycetes have revealed extremely low levels of genetic variation reﬂective of a highly clonal population structure. This occurred for rice-infecting isolates of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea  Leung and Williams 1986 , asexual populations of cereal rusts  Burdon and Roelfs 1985a,b , and worldwide populations of the oomycete  Phytophthora infestans  Spielman et al. 1991; Tooley et al. 1985 . Populations of fungi infecting conifer hosts in the western United States also appeared to be highly clonal and speciﬁc clones are characterized by ﬁxed heterozygosity  Otrosina et al. 1992; Vogler et al. 1991 .  Differences in levels of genetic variation among locations can help identify the center of origin of a species. The most diverse populations genetically should occur at or near the center of origin, as these populations will have had the longest time in which mutations can accumulate; derived populations usually will contain only a subset of the total species diversity. This idea has been combined with isozyme analysis the edible mushroom Agaricus bisporus to indicate that may be indigenous to North America  Kerrigan and Ross 1989  and that Phytophthora infestans, P. palmivora, and P. megakarya probably originated in central Mexico  Tooley et al. 1985 , southeast Asia  Mchau and Coffey 1994 , and central Africa  Nyasse´ et al. 1999 , respectively. Very limited genetic diversity indicated that the plant pathogens Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, Phytophthora cinnamomea, and Dilophospora alopecuri had only very limited introductions into Australia  Burdon et al. 1982; Old et al. 1984; Riley et al. 1998 , although the original source populations for the introductions could not be identiﬁed for certain.  6 CONCLUSIONS  Isozyme analysis is an extremely powerful and versatile technique that can answer many questions about fungal genetics, taxonomy, and population biology. Compared to alternative technologies, isozymes are cheap, fast, and easy to interpret. They only assay expressed genes and, by analysis of dimeric enzymes, can distinguish heterozygous individuals from physical mixtures of cultures—an advantage that is not shared by DNA-based markers. With newer types of electrophoresis systems, isozymes are suitable for analysis of small tissue samples and could be portable to remote locations. The main disadvantage of isozyme analysis is a lower level of polymorphism compared to DNA-based markers, but this usually can be overcome by increasing the number of enzyme systems assayed. The many advantages of isozyme analysis should ensure its place in the molecular toolbox for many years to come.

Mullaney U.S. Department of Agriculture –Agricultural Research Service, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA  1  INTRODUCTION  1.1 Need for Molecular Methods in Fungal  Identiﬁcation  fungal  For centuries, identiﬁcation has been based on morphological, physiological, and chemical characteristics of specimens. For the most part, these systems still work extremely well. They provide accurate species identiﬁcation inexpensively, are not labor-intensive, and require little equipment beyond a microscope and chemical reagents. Since phenotype is the result of the expression of hundreds of genes, the higher level classiﬁcations based on morphology  physiology are generally sound. A major drawback of the traditional identiﬁcation methods is that they require some technical training in order to acquire the skills necessary to identify fungi or characterize strains. This training has become increasingly difﬁcult to acquire, whereas molecular biology techniques are now taught widely in secondary schools and can be applied to a multitude of ﬁelds. Another drawback of the traditional methods is that they can take a week or more for fungal colonies to grow and develop the characters necessary for identiﬁcation. In some cases, the necessary characters never develop. Several of the molecular methods provide identiﬁcations more quickly and do not rely on the presence of reproductive structures.  for  taxonomists including the potential  Molecular biology has brought many powerful new tools to fungal rapid identiﬁcation of isolates, methods for rapid determination of virulence or toxicity of strains, and the means to elucidate the relationships among fungal species. DNA sequence data provide large numbers of data points that can be compared among fungi and analyzed to determine sequence relatedness, which can be assumed to reﬂect phylogenetic relatedness among species. If “phylogenetic trees” from different  molecular sites concur with one another and with “trees” based on morphological and physiological data, one has fairly strong evidence that the phylogeny is accurate. Some fungi do not grow or do not sporulate in culture. Molecular methodologies allow identiﬁcation of these isolates by comparison of DNA sequence data from the unknown isolate with sequences from known species. Molecular methods have also been used to distinguish between closely related species with few morphological differences and to distinguish strains  or even speciﬁc isolates  within a species. In studies of fungal metabolites, especially mycotoxins, there has been no way of knowing whether a nonproducing strain is truly  genetically  incapable of producing the metabolite or if it could possibly produce it under different environmental conditions. Once the genes of a metabolic pathway have been cloned, they can be used to determine whether or not a strain possesses the genes for production of the metabolite, providing a better indication of the potential of a given strain to produce a metabolite.  1.2 Assumptions and Limitations  The assumptions made in making fungal identiﬁcations using molecular methods are the same as those made using traditional methods. The concept of a species  or any other taxonomic level  is ultimately what those working in the ﬁeld agree it to be. These decisions are based on available data, but there is always some degree of subjectivity in the process, especially when considering closely related species.  None of the current molecular methods used in fungal identiﬁcation can screen more than a minute portion of the genome. There is no single method that can be used to distinguish all species or all genera from one another. Generally, if the data provided by a molecular method support current they are used.  taxonomic thought on a taxon,  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   A molecular method appropriate for identiﬁcation of one species or genus  or part thereof  may not be useful for species in other genera or even for all portions of one genus.  identiﬁcation, but  Molecular methods provide powerful new tools to aid in fungal they have not provided  and probably will never provide  a universal solution to problems associated with fungal identiﬁcation. They are tools, not panaceas, for taxonomists. Currently molecular methods are more labor-intensive and more expensive than many of the traditional methods of fungal identiﬁcation, but the ﬁeld is evolving and more rapid and affordable methods will probably become available.  1.3 Scope  It would be beyond the scope of this paper to review all of the studies using molecular methods for identiﬁcation of plant pathogenic fungi. Instead, we will provide an overview of the methods available for identiﬁcation and then give one or two recent examples from the literature. These citations will give interested readers a starting point for ﬁnding related citations in the literature.  2 METHODOLOGIES  The majority of molecularly-based identiﬁcation methods rely on the interaction of unique enzymes and nucleic acids. Two extensively utilized classes of enzymes are restriction endonucleases and DNA polymerases.  Restriction endonucleases cleave DNA molecules at speciﬁc nucleotide sequences. Different endonucleases recognize and cut at different restriction recognition sequences. An example of two endonucleases and the speciﬁc sequence they recognize are Eco RI  GAATTC  and Bam HI  GGATCC . Eco RI cleaves between the guanine and the adenine, G^AATTC and Bam HI between the guanines G^GATCC. Restriction fragment length polymorphism  RFLP  is one molecular technique that requires restriction endonucleases to produce the unique DNA fragments which are the basis for this technique.  Polymerases are enzymes that catalyze the formation of DNA or RNA from nucleotide precursors. All DNA polymerases also require a preexisting template. For example, various DNA polymerases are utilized for different applications [DNA polymerase I  Kornberg polymerase , is used to label DNA; Taq DNA polymerase is used to amplify DNA fragments in the Polymerase Chain Reaction  PCR ; etc.]; and some have been engineered for enhanced features, e.g., Sequenasee which is used in DNA sequencing.  In RFLP the assorted DNA fragments resulting from the restriction endonuclease digestion are resolved by gel electrophoresis. Ethidium bromide staining is then used to reveal the fragments under UV  260 nm  light. Southern blotting of the gel can transfer the DNA fragments to a support membrane. The DNA is then ﬁxed to the membrane  and can be subjected to hybridization analysis. This enables identiﬁcation of bands with sequence similarity to a labeled probe. Several printed reference laboratory manuals [e.g. Molecular cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Edition; Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, 4th Edition] and Internet web sites such as www.protocol-online.net and www.nwfsc.noaa.- gov protocols detail these techniques. In dot blots, the target nucleic acid sample is afﬁxed directly to the membrane without electrophoresis followed by hybridization with the labeled probe. Detailed information on these protocols can also be obtained by utilizing a search engine such as Googlee to search the internet.  DNA ﬁngerprinting is an umbrella term that describes molecular identiﬁcation techniques. As the term implies, the basic genetic material in the organism is utilized to determine its identity and relationship with other isolates. One of the earliest hybridization probes utilized was variable number tandem repeats  VNTRs  or minisatellite DNA  Jeffreys et al. 1985 . The term “satellite” originated from buoyant density centrifugation studies in which the bulk of the sample DNA sediments as one main band, but smaller satellite bands were also observed. Satellites are composed of tandem repeats of DNA arranged in consecutive repeats. They sediment apart from the main band containing the bulk of the DNA due to their signiﬁcantly different base composition. Minisatellites range in size from 1 kb to 20 kb. The VNTR are a type of minisatellite located in the noncoding regions of the genome. The size of the repeat units varies from 9 to 80 base pairs  bp . Smaller repeats consisting of only 1 – 6 bp are designated microsatellites, or short tandem repeats  STR . The STR have a repetitive region of less than 150 bp. Sequences of both mini- and microsatellites have been utilized in DNA ﬁngerprinting. In Meyer et al.  1991 , the DNA of various ﬁlamentous fungi were digested separately with different restriction endonucleases and the resulting fragments separated by electrophoresis. Selected VNTR oligonucleo- tides were labeled with 32P and hybridized to the dried gel. Results conﬁrmed that the method based on these minisatellite DNA probes could differentiate between species and strains of fungi. Microsatellites have been used to discriminate strains of the aﬂatoxigenic species Aspergillus ﬂavus and A. parasiticus  Tran-Dinh and Carter 2000 .  The PCR technology provides researchers with a means to rapidly amplify small amounts of DNA, and frees them from the time-consuming task of having to isolate sufﬁcient DNA for RFLP analysis. In PCR a thermostable polymerase is employed to enzymatically amplify a speciﬁc region of DNA sequence, deﬁned by a set of two oligonucleotide primers. The target DNA is denatured and the primers are then annealed to the single-stranded DNA. The DNA polymerase then synthesizes the complementary DNA strand across the target region. This process is then repeated and the targeted DNA may be ampliﬁed a million-fold or more.  Randomly Ampliﬁed Polymorphic DNA  RAPD  is a PCR technique that yields genetic markers without the need to obtain prior nucleotide sequence data  Williams et al. 1990 . Random nucleotide sequences are annealed to the template  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   DNA under low stringency. This is followed by PCR ampliﬁcation and electrophoresis to produce a DNA ﬁngerprint. The RAPD technique is relatively easy, fast, and requires only a minimum amount of starting material. However, the low stringency of the annealing process can produce PCR artifacts.  Several methods have been developed to reduce the number of artifacts produced by PCR ampliﬁcation. One method is by using two pairs of PCR primers, or nested primers  Plikaytis et al. 1990 . In this technique, the ﬁrst pair produces a PCR fragment. Then this fragment and the second pair of primers  nested primers  binding to DNA sequence a few bases internal to the ﬁrst pair of primers, are used in a further ampliﬁcation. If the ﬁrst pair of primers ampliﬁed the correct locus, then the second pair of primers will produce a slightly smaller PCR fragment. This method requires a knowledge of the sequence immediately adjacent to the ﬁrst pair of PCR primers in order to synthesize the other “nested” pair of primers.  If the host DNA sequence is not known, Ampliﬁed Fragment Length Polymorphism  AFLP  will also reduce the number of PCR artifacts  Vos et al. 1995 . In this technique, the target DNA is digested with restriction endonucleases to yield an assortment of different sized DNA fragments. Speciﬁc double-stranded adapter oligonucleotides are then ligated to these fragments. PCR primers speciﬁc to the adapter nucleotides are then sequences with various selective 3 utilized under high stringency PCR ampliﬁcation and electrophoresis to produce a unique fragment proﬁle. This technique is time-efﬁcient and ampliﬁcation is not completely random as in RAPD.  0  When the sequence of the target DNA is known, several other PCR procedures for identiﬁcation are available, such as PCR ampliﬁcation of internal transcribed spacer  ITS  of ribosomal DNA  rDNA . An example of the application of this PCR method is Beck and Ligon  1995  who designed PCR primers to detect Stagonospora nodorum and Septoria triticic in wheat. These primers were derived from species speciﬁc DNA sequences of the ITS of the pathogen’s ribosomal DNA. The PCR ampliﬁcation of ITS rDNA has also been employed to identify a wider variety of fungi that were potential pathogens and allergens  Makimura et al. 2001 .  Knowledge of the speciﬁc sequence of polymorphic loci permits high-stringency PCR and thus circumvents the problem of artifacts and low reproducibility associated with random-primer methods  Scott and Straus 2000 . One method of site-speciﬁc polymorphisms they reviewed was based on the sequence variability found in the introns of single copy metabolic and structural genes. Glass and Donaldson  1995  tested several such oligonucleotide primers for their ability to amplify segments of DNA that span introns in a selection of these genes. They identiﬁed primer sets that provided a useful tool for phylogenic studies of ﬁlamentous ascomycetes and related fungi. These oligonucleotide primers were utilized to differentiate Fusarium species  Donaldson et al. 1995 . The PCR fragments generated were digested with several 4 bp recognition restriction enzymes. The short recognition site,  four bases, of the restriction endonuclease increased the probability that a single base pair polymorphism could be detected.  Two other methods of high-stringency PCR are micro- satellite based PCR-ampliﬁcation and the use of the small subunit ribosomal DNA  SSU rDNA  based primers for DNA ﬁngerprinting  Scott and Straus 2000 . For example, Gargas and DePriest  1996  describe a list of PCR primers used to amplify and sequence the small subunit of fungal nuclear rDNA. This information identiﬁes primers for special applications  intron-spanning, intron speciﬁc, etc  and represents a valuable resource for further research. Groppe et al.  1995  synthesized oligonucleotides corresponding to regions of the sequence of a microsatellite of the endophytic ascomycete Epichloe¨ typhina. These were used for PCR ampliﬁcation of DNA from different Epichloe¨ isolates. The DNA from most isolates produced a single PCR product. This study pointed to a potentially useful role for microsatellite- containing loci as a molecular marker for population studies of Epichloe¨ and other unrelated fungi.  DNA sequencing, while not yet extensively utilized because of the time and resources required, has been employed to a limited degree in species identiﬁcation. Wang et al.  2001  recently reported on the use of mitochondrial cytochrome b gene to identify species of Aspergillus section Flavi. Mycelia of the Aspergillus isolates were harvested and their hyphae ruptured with glass beads and zymolyase. Their mitochondria were then collected by centrifugation and their mtDNA extracted. The sequence of the cytochrome b gene has also been used to distinguish species of Aspergillus section Fumigati  Wang et al. 2000  and for investigating the phylogentic relationships of other species of Aspergillus  Wang et al. 1998 .  Single-Strand Conformation Polymorphism  SSCP   is another PCR-based system that requires knowledge of the target DNA sequence to generate speciﬁc oligonucleotide primers. In this technique, the target DNA is concurrently labeled and ampliﬁed by PCR using a labeled substrate. The PCR product is then denatured and resolved by electrophoresis. Any changes  mutations, etc.  in the target DNA are detected as altered mobility of separated single strands in autoradiograms. Precise information about the exact change can then be obtained by eluting the targeted DNA from the gel and amplifying it again for sequence determination  Hayashi 1991 . Heteroduplex analysis, like SSCP, is a recently developed technique that can detect a single base difference in target DNA  Keen et al. 1991 . PCR ampliﬁcation products from the isolates are combined after heat denaturation and then allowed to reanneal to form heteroduplexes. Any mismatched nucleotides, caused by substitutions, insertions, deletions, etc, will affect the DNA structure of the heteroduplex and lower its electrophoretic mobility. The heteroduplex is compared to duplexes with complete base complementarity by electro- phoresis. Kumeda and Asao  2001  employed this technique for the detection of intraspeciﬁc variation in isolates of Aspergillus Section Flavi. In their heteroduplex panel analysis  HAP , fragments of the internal spacer  ITS   Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   regions of the rDNA gene of the different isolates were ﬁrst ampliﬁed. Heteroduplexes were then generated with the standard ITS reference fragment and then subjected to electrophoresis. The results of this HAP study corresponded well with the established taxonomy of the Section Flavi.  3 RECENT APPLICATIONS IN PLANT  PATHOLOGY  Most recent studies in molecular identiﬁcation have used PCR in some form. This is not surprising given the power of this tool for analyzing DNA. As the use of PCR methodologies in plant disease diagnosis was reviewed by Henson and French  1993 , Mills  1996 , our emphasis will be on studies conducted since these reviews. The number of studies on various plant pathogenic genera generally reﬂects the relative importance of these genera in plant pathology. One of the genera receiving the most attention from molecular biologists, for both understanding phylogeny and pathogenicity, has been Fusarium. Recent work on this genus has been reviewed elsewhere  Nicholson 2001 .  Applications of molecular techniques in plant pathology have provided methods for identiﬁcation of isolates of plant pathogens, and identiﬁcation of pathogens directly from plant materials such as leaves, seeds, or roots. These procedures may be applied at almost any taxonomic level, but usually address taxa at species level and below [e.g. races of a given pathogen]. Molecular methods have also proved useful for distinguishing nontaxonomic categories such as virulence or toxicity.  3.1  Identiﬁcation of Pathogens In Vitro  Information from some recently published studies using molecular methods to identify plant pathogenic fungi from  culture is summarized in Table 1. Many of these studies were designed to develop methods to distinguish between closely related taxa within a single genus or species for which morphological or physiological characters overlap or take too long to develop.  There are several advantages in isolating the fungus of interest in culture before conducting molecular identiﬁ- cations. First, one knows immediately whether or not the pathogen is viable in the plant. Second, working with pure cultures lessens the possibility of errors such as accidentally creating a PCR product from the wrong fungus. There are also disadvantages to this approach. First, it takes longer time because the pathogen must be isolated before it is analyzed. Second, some true  obligate  pathogens cannot be cultured in the laboratory. Finally, metabolites such as mycotoxins may remain in the crop even after the fungus dies and these may be missed if no viable fungus is present.  3.2  Identiﬁcation of Pathogens Directly from Plant Parts  Examples of studies using molecular methods to identify pathogens directly from plant parts are given in Table 2. Most of these involve identiﬁcation of fungal species using RAPDs or PCR of the ITS-rDNA.  Developing methods for direct isolation of speciﬁc fungal DNA from plant tissues is more difﬁcult than isolating DNA from a pure fungal strain, but the potential impact of the former methods is tremendous. These assays have demon- strated the presence of the pathogens in asymptomatic plants  Doohan et al. 1998 . Some of these procedures take only seven to 24 h to perform  Lee et al. 2001; Lovic et al. 1995 , compared with several days to a week for traditional methods or methods requiring that the fungus be isolated prior to DNA  Table 1 Examples of studies on molecular identiﬁcation of fungal plant pathogens in vitro  Fungal genus  Host  Level of discrimination  Method  Citation  Alternaria Botrytis Claviceps Colletotrichum Elsinoe Fusarium Fusarium Gaeumannomyces Gibberella  Fusarium  Gibberella  Fusarium  Macrophomina Rhizoctonia Rhynchosporium Tilletia Venturia  Umbellifers Onion Sorghum Alfalfa Citrus Tomato Cucumber Turf-grass Banana corn Banana corn  Bean, cornþ  Various Barley Wheat Pear  Species Species subgroup Species populations Species Species Virulence within race Forma specialis Variety Species toxicity host Species Population Anastomosis grp subsets Species Species Species  RAPD PCR-ITS rDNA AFLP and RAM AFLP RAPD RAPD RAPD PCR-ITS rDNA RAPD PCR-ITS rDNA AFLP PCR-ITS rDNA PCR-ITS rDNA TaqManPCR-MtDNA PCR-ITS rDNA  Pryor and Gilbertson 2002 Nielsen et al. 2001 Tooley et al. 2000 O’Neill et al. 1997 Hyun et al. 2001 Mes et al. 1999 Vakalounakis and Fragkiadakis 1999 Goodwin et al. 1995 Jimenez et al. 2000 Jimenez et al. 2000 Mayek-Perez et al. 2001 Carling et al. 2002 Lee et al. 2001 Frederick et al. 2000 Le Cam et al. 2002  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

Moreover, fungi that do not grow in pure culture may be studied with these techniques. On the other hand, amplifying DNA of nonviable fungi would lead to false- positives for disease potential, but would nevertheless provide useful information for researchers interested in mycotoxins.  REFERENCES  4 CONCLUSIONS  Molecular methodologies have been used successfully to address a number of problems in identiﬁcation of plant pathogenic fungi. Not all of the molecular identiﬁcation methods have been fully utilized, but this will probably change in the future. Practical application of molecular methodologies is increasing as the instruments become less expensive and the protocols less complex. The demand for rapid, accurate identiﬁcation of plant pathogens is growing. In addition to the need for such methods in ﬁeld diagnosis and import export issues, the threat of plant pathogens as potential bioterrorist weapons has added impetus to the need for rapid identiﬁcation. The lack of a universally applicable technique that would differentiate all fungi makes rapid identiﬁcation difﬁcult unless preliminary morphological or physiological information is available. New methods are being developed  Schaad et al. 2002  which hold great promise for rapid identiﬁcation of many plant pathogens.

Bridge* Birkbeck College, University of London, London, and Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, Surrey, United Kingdom  Tanuja Singh   Dilip K. Arora† Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India  1  INTRODUCTION  Fungi are present in a variety of forms, in almost every habitat, where they are often speciﬁc in their occurrence on particular types of host  or substrate  and ecological niche. Fungi may also become partners with higher plants and enter complex biological relationships with the host  Clay and Kover 1996; Thrall and Burdon 1997 . The term pathogen is deﬁned as “a parasite able to cause disease in a host or range of hosts”  Kirk et al. 2001 , and pathogenic fungi can occur on all plants. In this chapter this deﬁnition of plant pathogenic fungi will be limited to those that cause diseases of living plants, and therefore does not include the fungi involved in the spoilage of stored plant materials that are often referred to as causing post harvest “diseases.” The plant pathogenic fungi consist of a large group of genera and species from diverse areas of the fungal kingdom. Recent developments in the understanding of the evolution of eukaryotic organisms have meant that a number of important plant pathogenic organisms have been reclassiﬁed, and are no longer considered as fungi sensu stricto. These include the economically important genera of Phytophthora, Pythium, and other Oomycetes, that are now placed in the Straminipila  Dick 2001 . Plant pathogenic fungi have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on crop productivity. Devastating fungal diseases such as corn smut, potato blight, and black stem rust of wheat can destroy many economically important crops. This situation becomes more critical when the interaction between pathogen and the host  plant involves relatively long periods of intimate interaction without apparent damage to the host, and where the pathogen can persist in asymptomatic hosts for many years  Stanosz et al. 1997 . The effects of fungi on living plants vary considerably. At one extreme, damage may be limited to lesions on leaves or stems [e.g., caused by some small Alternaria species, see Ellis  1968 ], while at the other extreme the plant may be rapidly killed [e.g., by some Verticillium species, see Pegg  1984 ].  Much work has been done to control fungal disease through selection and breeding programs, the genetic modiﬁcation of both host and pathogen, and the introduction of resistant varieties [see Stukely and Crane  1994 ]. The success of these efforts depends largely on the understanding of genetic variability in the fungal population and monitoring this variation in nature. Many aspects of the biology of the fungi have important consequences at the population level. This particularly applies to the mode of reproduction  i.e., the relative contributions of sexual and asexual, outcrossing and selﬁng mechanisms , and to hyphal anastomosis between genetically different individuals  Brasier 1991; Glass and Kuldau 1992; Milgroom et al. 1996 . A further consideration is that some fungi are predominantly haploid in their vegetative phase, some are diploid, and some are dikaryotic. In the case of pathogenic fungi, genetic variability can be introduced through a variety of mechanisms, either during sexual reproduction or independently of it  Kistler and Miao 1992 . Such variability is signiﬁcant as it can inﬂuence  Present afﬁliations: *British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, United Kingdom. †National Bureau of Agriculturally Important Microorganisms  NBAIM , New Delhi, India.

Understanding the epidemiology of plant pathogenic fungi depends upon on the ability to unambiguously identify sexually produced individuals and asexually produced clones. identiﬁcation traits, such as morphological, Classical physiological, and disease characters, lack the required sensitivity and accuracy needed for identifying individuals within a population, and this has prevented detailed population studies for many years. Recent developments in molecular techniques now allow population studies on plant pathogenic fungi, and these can be performed with great sensitivity and accuracy. An almost unlimited number of polymorphic loci can be used to detect individual genotypes for the direct assessment of genetic variation in a given fungal population. Application of molecular markers has also allowed the investigation of evolutionary processes in a large number of agriculturally important fungi  Mitchell and Brasier 1994; Milgroom et al. 1996; Valent and Chumley 1991; Vilgalys and Cubeta 1994 , and the number and scope of these studies is rapidly expanding.  2 REASONS FOR DETERMINING  EPIDEMIOLOGY  As is the case for human and animal diseases, a knowledge of the epidemiology of plant disease can provide important information for its treatment and control, and can lead to the development of forecasting systems [see Shaw 2001; Zadoks and Schein 1979]. In the case of fungal plant diseases, particularly those affecting agricultural crops, the two main areas that need to be determined are the mechanism of spread of the disease, and the speciﬁcity and host range of the infecting organism. Fungi are transmitted to, and between, plants by a number of different mechanisms. Many fungi are spread through the soil, some growing from previously infected debris in or above the soil. Others can be transmitted as spores and other propagules through water droplets, or directly as airborne particles. Some plant pathogens may exist on secondary hosts, such as Fusarium oxysporum  Armstrong and Armstrong 1958  or on weeds [see Terry and Parker  2001 ]. If these hosts are present in or near a crop, they may then act as a reservoir that allows a crop disease to be carried over successive plantings. A few plant pathogenic fungi such as Ophiostoma species [see Brasier  1991 ] can be spread by insects and other vectors, and some such as Sclerospora graminicola  Shetty et al. 1980  remain in the seeds of infected plants, and cause disease in subsequent generations. If the mechanism of transmission is known, this knowledge may be important in the development of control or treatment strategies. Such knowledge is particularly important in the selection of planting material, the preparation and main- tenance of planting areas, and the establishment of crop successions and rotation [see Maude  1996 ].  is being transmitted in terms of  In addition to knowledge of the mode of transmission of a plant pathogen, it is also important to be able to determine exactly what fungal populations. In some cases a single fungal species may consist of a number of different host speciﬁc populations. An example of this is the vascular wilt pathogen F. oxysporum, where around 170 different forms  referred to as special forms  have been identiﬁed. Each of these special forms shows preferential or speciﬁc pathogenicity to different hosts, and so F. oxysporum special form cubense will cause vascular wilt of banana, but would not be expected to cause signiﬁcant disease on oil palm. Therefore, in order to monitor what fungi are present, and may pose a risk to a crop, it is necessary to know speciﬁc details of their pathogenicity. This situation becomes further complicated if there are subpopulations within the pathogen that show differential pathogenicity, either in terms of the degree of damage or the particular cultivars attacked. Such populations are generally described as races, and the ability to differentiate these can make a signiﬁcant difference to their control. A further factor in considering populations in fungal plant pathogens is whether the population is comprised of meiotic or mitotic forms. Some pathogenic fungi, such as Fusarium species, occur almost exclusively in a mitotic  or imperfect  form. In this state, the variability within the population can be assumed to be relatively low, particularly if the disease is the result of a single introduction. Some fungal pathogens, such as Phytophthora and the rusts and smuts, are however present on the plant in a meiotic  or perfect  form, and this allows for variability to be introduced into the population at each generation [for example see Duncan et al.  1998 ].  3 TYPES OF MOLECULAR MARKERS  Detection of fungi on the basis of visual examination of morphology is highly selective and species-speciﬁc identiﬁ- cation of fungi and spores is therefore difﬁcult. Molecular techniques present several advantages over the traditional ones and, most importantly, nucleic acid sequences unique to particular organisms can generally be found. As these techniques do not rely on phenotypic examination, gene expression is not required and identiﬁcation times can be reduced signiﬁcantly. In the fungi, molecular markers can be derived from both variable and conserved regions of the nuclear and mitochondrial genome, and different markers have been used to deﬁne populations at all levels from an individual isolate upwards. Some methods have the potential for the detection of speciﬁc genomic DNA sequences directly from initial plant samples, thereby eliminating the require- ment to isolate and culture the fungus. Speciﬁc molecular markers, probes, and primers have commonly been developed from a variety of DNA sequences including randomly cloned genomic DNA fragments and speciﬁc regions such as genes coding for ribosomal RNA  rRNA , virulence factors, and insertion sequences.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   3.1 Ribosomal DNA  The nuclear genomes of fungi have a number of particular features. They are relatively small  approximately 13 – 93 million nucleotide base pairs , and in comparison to higher plants and animals they have a much lower percentage of redundant DNA  about 10 – 20%   Lu 1996 . Around 30% of the entire fungal genome consists of duplicated regions and genes  Mewes 1997 . These repetitive sequences provide potential targets for molecular markers due to their high copy number.  Ribosomal DNA  rDNA , speciﬁcally the regions coding for the rRNA subunits and their associated spacers, is one of the most commonly used DNA regions for fungal molecular markers [see Bridge and Arora 1998; Bruns et al. 1991; www.mendel.berkeley.edu boletus boletus.html; www. biology.duke.edu fungi ]. The nuclear-encoded rRNA genes  rDNA  and spacers occur as a gene cluster  typically of 8 – 12 kb  that is multiply repeated  see Figure 1 . The basic unit consists of the genes for the small ribosomal subunit, the 5.8S subunit, and the large subunit. The three genes are separated by two internally transcribed spacers  ITS , and the repeated gene clusters are separated by an intergenic spacer  IGS  that in many, but not all fungi, also contains the gene for the 5S subunit. [see Hillis and Dixon  1991 ]. Several restrictions sites are conserved in fungal rDNA, and this makes them convenient sequences for cloning [see other reviews by Gargas and DePriest  1996 ; Hibbett  1992 ]. The rRNA cluster has proved to be a good region for deriving molecular markers for many fungi [see Bruns et al.  1991 ; Hibbett  1992 ]. The subunit genes have both conserved and variable domains, and can be used for comparisons of genera, the spacer regions are considerably more variable and can be used for comparisons of species or in some cases speciﬁc pathogenic forms  see Table 1 . As the cluster is universal and multiply repeatedly, it is a good target for molecular studies. Originally these studies involved obtaining RFLPs with probes hybridized to total genomic DNA digests, and many  studies of populations and species of plant pathogens were carried out in this way [e.g., Jabaji-Hare et al.  1990 , Manicom et al.  1990 ]. More recently these studies have largely been replaced by polymerase chain reaction  PCR  based studies, particularly as the rRNA cluster can often be detected in old or contaminated environmental samples [see Bruns et al.  1990 ]. The varying levels of speciﬁcity of the different DNA regions in the gene cluster also mean that it is possible to amplify fungal DNA directly from samples of infected plant material  Bridge et al. 2000; Gardes and Bruns 1993 .  Both the ITS and the IGS regions have been used to develop species-speciﬁc primers for plant pathogen detection in plant material [e.g., Brown et al.  1993 ; Moukhamedov et al.  1993 ]. It is becoming increasingly common in rRNA cluster studies to obtain sequences of all the regions of interest. Although knowledge of the complete sequences provides a large amount of information, useful information may be obtained from simple restriction digestions of rRNA ampliﬁcation products. This approach generally produces relatively simple patterns containing 1 – 4 bands, and in certain cases these patterns, or individual bands, may be speciﬁc for particular pathogens [e.g., Chen  1992 ]. It is not possible to list all the work done using ITS and IGS regions to develop molecular markers. One example of this was the study of Mazzola et al.  1996  who developed an oligonucleotide primer set that consistently and selectively ampliﬁed a 511 bp fragment in the ITS region that could be used to differentiate between Rhizoctonia solani and R. oryzae. It should, however, be remembered that RFLP analysis is essentially a one-tailed analysis of variation; and although different patterns indicate that two organisms are different, a common pattern is based on only the position of a few restriction sites. Therefore, identical RFLP band patterns do not imply that the rest of the sequence is identical.  3.2 Protein Coding Genes  There are numerous gene sequences that have been examined in the systematics and phylogeny of plant pathogenic fungi. These include genes for the production of actin, tubulin, elongation factors, cytochromes, proteases, and many others [e.g., Glass and Donaldson  1995 ; Mehmann et al.  1994 ; Schoch et al.  2001 ]. These genes are generally highly conserved between distant organisms; but can contain short introns that can be very variable in insertion position and number [see Edelmann and Staben  1994 ]. This variation in introns can be useful as a molecular marker among closely related organisms and this has been investigated for a number of plant associated fungi including Fusarium, Ascochyta, and Phoma  see later .  3.3 Fingerprinting Methods  Figure 1 Ribosomal rRNA gene cluster arrangement.

However, there is at least one report of presumed recombination in the rDNA of fungi  see text .  pathogenic fungi to generate largely random PCR fragments from the total genome. These techniques have also been referred to as total genome proﬁling. One of the oldest and most widely used of such PCR methods is random ampliﬁed polymorphic DNA  RAPD  analysis  Welsh and McClelland 1990; Williams et al. 1990 . Essentially RAPD analysis relies on the reduction in speciﬁcity of the PCR process at reduced temperatures. Total genome DNA extractions are used, and these are ampliﬁed with single, short  usually decamer  primers at a reduced annealing temperature. These conditions result in less stringent binding of the primer to the target DNA, and allow the ampliﬁcation of a number of generally small regions of DNA. These are separated by electrophoresis to give a proﬁle of bands. The RAPD analysis has been criticized as it is not always entirely reproducible, but it has been used extensively for proﬁling populations of plant pathogens [e.g., Bentley et al.  1995 ; Cooke et al.  1996 ]. In many cases these studies have shown correlations between band patterns and host, disease type or geographical origin, and band patterns have also been used to differentiate between forms of the same fungus causing different disease symptoms [e.g., Pei et al.  1997 ]. Another common PCR ﬁngerprinting method that has been used for plant pathogenic fungi is ampliﬁcation of sequences based on simple repetitive primers. In this method, single short repetitive primers are used at moderate annealing temperatures in order to amplify largely repetitive fragments of the genome. One target site for this method is the ﬂanking region of genes that can contain variable numbers of such repeats. Repeat motifs that have been used for primers have varied from simple 2 – 3 base repeats such as  CA 8 and  CAG 5  Freeman and Rodriguez 1995; Latge et al. 1998  to more complex sequences including the M13 bacteriophage universal sequencing primer [see Bridge et al.  1997 ]. Another method of ﬁngerprinting that has been used with some fungi is based on a group of short repetitive DNA sequences that have been found dispersed throughout the genome of diverse bacterial species [see van Belkum et al.  1998 ]. Primers speciﬁc to these repetitive sequences produce multiple products in PCR with fungal  genomic DNA, and these can then be separated to provide simple ﬁngerprints. Three particular unrelated families of such repetitive DNA sequences, BOX  54 bp , ERIC  124 bp , and REP,  35 – 40 bp  have also been used to characterize subspeciﬁc populations of different plant pathogenic fungi [see Arora et al.  1996 ; Toda et al.  1999 ].  A relatively recent development in ﬁngerprinting fungi has been the introduction of ampliﬁed fragment length poly- morphism  AFLP  analysis [see Vos and Kuipper  1997 ; Vos et al.  1995 ]. In this technique, total DNA is digested with restriction enzymes, and then short artiﬁcial oligonucleotides  linkers  are ligated to the restriction enzyme sites. Speciﬁc primers are then designed that show a particular degree of speciﬁcity to the linker sequences, and large fractions of the total DNA can then be ampliﬁed as fragments. The AFLP analysis generates many bands, and electrophoresis is usually undertaken in large polyacrylamide gels, is however, possible to undertake more restricted studies that generate fewer bands and that can be analyzed in smaller electrophoresis systems [e.g., Mueller et al.  1996 ]. At the conclusion of RAPD and AFLP analyses PCR bands of interest can be extracted, puriﬁed, and sequenced to produce sequence characterized ampliﬁed regions  SCARs . The sequence information obtained from SCARs can then be used to develop more speciﬁc PCR primers for detection methods [e.g., Dobrowolski and O’Brien  1993 ; Leclerc-Potvin et al.  1999 ].  it  3.4 Other Total Genome Approaches  Two other methods that have been used to characterize populations of plant pathogenic fungi are the analysis of overall repetitive DNA, and chromosome size and number. When total fungal DNA is digested with frequent cutting restriction enzymes, a large number of fragments of many different sizes are generated, and these appear in a gel as a “smear.” Brighter staining bands can be seen in these smears where there are multiple copies of fragments of the same size.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   These bands are, in part, the result of multiple copy DNA such as the rRNA genes and mitochondrial DNA  mtDNA . Differences in the patterns of these bands can be a quick, simple way for differentiating some closely related fungi, and this approach has been used for race designation in F. oxysporum sp. f. pisi [see Coddington et al.  1987 ].  Unlike plants and animals, fungal chromosomes can be very variable, and in many fungal species different isolates may show differences in the number and size of their chromosomes. This has been investigated in some isolates of Colletotrichum and special In Colletotrichum variation was found in the number and size of the smaller  type B  elements, and in F. oxysporum sp. f. cubense variation in chromosome sizes was found between different races and vegetative compatibility groups [see Masel et al.  1993 ; Ploetz  1990 ].  forms of F. oxysporum.  3.5 Mitochondrial Sequences  The mitochondrial  mt  genome has been used extensively in the investigation of population structures in the plant pathogenic fungi. In fungi the mitochondrial genome is a circular structure of between 17 and 121 Kb [see Zimmer et al.  1984 ; Curole and Kocher  1999 ; Grossman and Hudspeth  1985 ; Lu  1996 ]. The fungal mitochondrial genome makes up between 1 – 20% of the DNA occurring in fungal cells, and generally contains a high proportion of sequences that lack a coding function. In addition it may contain many repeat sequences and introns, and these features can allow for considerable variation in mitochondrial sequences between closely related organisms [see Clark-Walker  1992 ; Clark-Walker et al.  1987 ; see chapter numbers 11 and 12 in this book]. As it is present in multiple copies, mtDNA can be a good target for molecular methods. In most cases mito- chondrial DNA is inherited unilinearly during meiosis but recombination may occur in some fungi  Wolf 1996 . In addition, mtDNA can be transferred independently of the nuclear genome during unstable vegetative fusion  Collins and Saville 1990 . The mtDNA can contain GC rich palindromic repeats, but overall, simple GC sequences are relatively rare in fungal mitochondria, and this has been used in differential DNA restriction protocols to generate presumptive mitochon- drial RFLPs [e.g., Kouvelis and Typas  1997 ; Lacourt et al.  1994 ]. The mitochondrial genome contains both variable and conserved regions and so sequence information may be used at a variety of taxonomic levels [see Zhou and Stanosz  2001 ]. In some cases closely related species may have very different mitochondrial genomes, and one example of this is in the yeast Saccharomyces, where mtDNA varies from 24 to 78 Kb between different species [see Grossman and Hudspeth  1985 ]. Analysis of mtDNA variation has been used at a variety of different population and systematic levels, and these have correlated with subspecies, vegetative incompatibility groups, different populations and individuals  Gordon and Okamoto 1992; Jacobson and Gordon 1990; Miller et al. 1999 .  3.6  Inserted Elements  Both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes in fungi may contain a wide range of inserted elements [e.g., see Edelmann and Staben  1994 ; chapters 11 and 12]. At the very simplest these may be very short sequences left after transposon insertion and removal, and at the more complex they include a wide range of different transposons [see Daboussi  1997 ; Daboussi and Langin  1994 ]. Inserted elements, particularly introns, have been investigated as potential molecular markers at both the population level and the higher phylogenetic level  DePriest 1993; Neuve´glise et al. 1997 .  3.7 Application of Individual Markers  The suitability and resolution of individual markers will depend very much on the fungus being considered, and a marker that is useful for differentiating species in one group of fungi, may be considerably more conserved or variable in other fungal groups. One example of this is the use of presumptive mtDNA RFLPs  AT rich DNA . The mtDNA RFLPs have been found useful for determining species and subspeciﬁc populations in some species of Aspergillus, whereas in the species Metarhizium anisopliae and Verti- cillium lecanii the same approach identiﬁes numerous subspeciﬁc groupings  Kouvelis and Typas 1997; Typas et al. 1998; Varga et al. 1994 . In the plant pathogen F. oxysporum sp. f. cubense mtDNA RFLPs have been used to distinguish between different races and supported the theory that the recently determined race 4 was not derived from the existing race 1 or 2  Thomas et al. 1994 . In the basidiomycete Ganoderma boninense mtDNA RFLPs have been found useful for deﬁning individuals  Miller et al. 1999 , and in some Phytophthora species they have been used for determining parental lines  Whittaker et al. 1994 .  Differences in the level of variability seen with the same marker from different taxa is not restricted to mtDNA, and appears to be a feature of most markers investigated for population and species level investigations. One example of this is the degree of ITS sequence difference seen between isolates of a single species, or between closely related species. As an example there is generally up to around 5% ITS sequence variation within individual species of Colleto- trichum, and a maximum of about 23% variation between species  Sreenivasaprasad et al. 1996 . In Rhizoctonia solani, up to 30% variation in the ITS sequences has been reported between isolates of the same anastomosis group  Kuninaga et al. 1997 .  3.8 Combining Markers  In general terms the use of different markers can give rise to a hierarchic system, with particular techniques giving more, or less, resolution than others [see Bruns et al.  1991 ], and so it  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   may be possible to select an appropriate marker for the situation under study. An example of the way in which a broadly hierarchic arrangement of markers can be used for the study of fungal plant pathogens is detailed later with G. boninense. This approach will however not always generate consistent results, and one example of this is the group of fungal plant pathogens known as the “Ascochyta- complex” that occurs on beans, peas, and other legumes. In this case there are a number of distinct species currently assigned to either the genus Ascochyta or Phoma  see Table 2 . Most of these species can be deﬁned individually from their ITS sequences, and some can in turn be subdivided on the basis of their mtDNA RFLPs. When a single part of the mitochondrial genome is considered there is less variability, and the species can be arranged in three groups. The groupings obtained from RFLPs derived from the b-tubulin gene are less consistent and group some species together, while also showing subspeciﬁc groups in others  Fatehi 2000 .  3.9 Selection of Molecular Markers  Two of the most important factors that need to be considered in the selection of molecular markers in any study are the taxonomic rank under consideration, and the life cycle of the fungus. As detailed above, a marker that is particularly useful at a certain taxonomic rank for one species may not be useful at the same rank for another species. One explanation for this is that different systematists or plant pathologists have had different species concepts, and so the terms species and subspecies may not be directly comparable between different fungal genera. In some genera, such as Fusarium, there has been a tradition of placing different pathogenic forms in the special form category, whereas in others, such as Colleto- trichum or Phoma, there has been a general history of describing new species. Such differences in species concepts may reﬂect evolutionary ages, or may reﬂect levels of  Table 2 Features of Ascochyta complex species on legumes  Species  P. exigua  A. rabiei A. fabae A. fabae f. sp. lentis A. pisi P. medicaginis var. pinodella A. pinodes P. subboltshauseri  749 bp 749 bp 660 bp 660 bp 660 bp 660 bp 645 bp 645 bp 645 bp 645 bp 645 bp  variation in other characters. Whatever the reason, there can be signiﬁcant differences in the degree of variation seen in the molecular markers chosen.  Fungi occur in asexually  imperfect, anamorphic  and sexually  perfect, teleomorphic  reproducing forms, and in some cases both forms are present at the same time  holomorphic . In the imperfect state cell division is solely by mitosis, whereas in the perfect state recombination and meiosis will occur. Recombination and meiosis can have a signiﬁcant effect on results obtained from some molecular markers  see Table 1 . Isoenzyme markers could be expected to be subject to allelic variation under such circumstances, as would many DNA ﬁngerprinting markers. The degree to which a marker will be affected will vary considerably, and one example is the comparison of sibling haploid lines derived from a single dikaryotic fruit body. In these circumstances, the haploid progeny have arisen by meiosis and may show different isoenzyme or DNA ﬁngerprints from the parental material. This has been investigated in the oil palm pathogen G. boninense where both RAPD  Pilotti et al. 2000  and simpliﬁed AFLP  Figure 2  ﬁngerprints differed both between siblings and between siblings and parent. This variation can then be further compounded through subsequent mating and recombination.  Some molecular markers can be expected to be consistent despite meiosis and recombination. DNA sequences of major structural and functional proteins will be resistant to recombination events, and the rRNA gene cluster is one region generally considered to be maintained under such conditions  Hillis and Dixon 1991 . There are however some indications that this is not always the case, and there is at least one report that in some fungi, not only can the rRNA region be affected by crossover, but also that this may occur at a higher frequency than predicted  Selosse et al. 1996 .  Nonnuclear markers may be recombination insensitive, and mtDNA has been used to demonstrate a single hereditary line, where the mtDNA was inherited unilinearly  Whittaker et al. 1994 .

It should be remembered that some of these coefﬁcients have been described independently on more than one occasion, and others can be related to each other by simple transformations. For example Nei and Li’s genetic distance is equivalent to 1-Sorensen’s coefﬁcient, and Sorensen’s coefﬁcient is mathematically identical to Dice’s coefﬁcient [see Bridge and Saddler  1998 ; Sneath and Sokal  1973 ]. Similarly, association coefﬁcients can be related to distance measures, and taxonomic distance can be deﬁned as the square root of 1 minus the simple matching coefﬁcient. is therefore important if more than one measure is used to ensure that those selected are independent.  It  isolates  Although cluster analysis methods are a common way of showing relationships within and between fungal populations, this methodology does however have some limitations. One obvious limitation with any tree diagram is that all the isolates must be linked, as there is no provision for an isolate that is not related. A second limitation is that cluster analysis is a good technique for showing the membership of a group, it is less precise in showing relationships between groups. This is a particular failing of average linkage based systems, but is also true of most other clustering approaches [see Abbott et al.  1985 ]. A further limitation to cluster analysis is the tendency of that are unrelated to the main population to form a separate cluster together, even though they may be only distantly related to each other. Such clusters are sometimes described as sharing only the single property that they are not related to the main population. One way in which some of these limitations can be overcome is by using an ordination-based method such as principle component analysis  PCA . In these methods correlated variance between characters is combined to produce a further set of axes that are essentially made up of additive components of correlated individual characters. Each axis represents a proportion of the total variance in the data, and the placement of isolates is by plotting their positions in relation to the ﬁrst 2 or 3 axes [see Alderson 1985; Dudzinski 1975 . A reﬁnement of PCA is principle coordinate analysis  PCO . PCO has been shown to be appropriate for binary data, such as obtained from band patterns, and unlike PCA, does not require the use of strictly metric coefﬁcients  Gower 1966; Sneath and Sokal 1973 . Unlike a cluster analysis, this does not produce a series of groups, but a scatter-plot where similar isolates may be placed near each other. These ordination methods can behave differently from cluster analysis, and typically are better at representing between group relationships than close within group relationships. One further aspect of PCA is that under some circumstances it may ﬁlter random variation from a complex data set, as any correlated variation will tend to be included in the ﬁrst few axes [see Bridge  1998 ].  Band analysis methods are essentially the same for simple and complex patterns. It however becomes necessary to consider band reading software for the very complex patterns that may be produced by techniques such as AFLP, as the large number of bands produced cannot be easily scored by  Figure 2 Simple sequence repetitively primed molecular ﬁngerprints for 4 lines of Ganoderma derived from a single lanes 2 and 3 bracket. Lane 1, molcular size markers; monokaryotic culture derived from basidiospore a; lanes 4 and 5, monokaryotic culture derived from basidiospore b; lanes 6 and 7, monokaryotic culture derived from basidiospore c; lanes 8 and 9, dikaryotic culture obtained from b and c.  not always be the case, as not all fungi have unilinear mitochondrial inheritance, and in some cases mitochondrial recombination will occur during biparental inheritance  Borst and Grivell 1978 . The range and type of variation associated with molecular markers can provide many different tools that can be used for determining the epidemiology of plant pathogenic fungi. At one level, recombination insensitive markers may be available for the detection of a particular taxon in the environment, such as species and pathogen speciﬁc probes and primers. At a lower level, recombination sensitive markers may be used to follow individuals or lines, or to determine if a disease is spread by spores or through vegetative growth.  4 ANALYSING DATA  Different molecular markers will generate results in different forms. Simple RFLPs and some ﬁngerprinting methods will produce generally simple band patterns, usually of the order of between one and 20 bands. These patterns can be translated into a simple binary form where each band obtained in the analysis is considered as an independent character, and is scored as present or absent. In most cases, these binary records have then been compared by the use of one or more distance or association calculation, and represented as some form of dendrogram. There is a wide range of coefﬁcients available for such comparisons. These include coefﬁcients that do not consider matching negative characters, and others that provide for a double weighting of common bands to reﬂect the presence of common restriction sites or primer sequences at each end of the bands [e.g., Nei and Li  1979 ].

There are a range of band reading and matching software packages available, and most of these convert band patterns in a gel into densitometric traces where peak presence, height, and shape correspond to band presence, intensity, and thickness, respectively. These packages commonly have manual and automated routines for correcting gels for shift and stretch events, and routines for including standard size markers and other reference bands. Trace data can be readily converted to quantitative values as “x,y co-ordinates” and this is suitable for largely distance based analyses. Quantitative data can also be compared for overall pattern similarity through methods such as correlation coefﬁcients, and concentration independent calculations such as cosine theta [see Feltham and Sneath  1979 ].  Analysis of sequence data is more complicated as the likelihood of certain events may also be included in the analysis. The ﬁrst stage in comparing DNA sequences is to align them to each other. Alignment routines will always seek the best alignment of the sequences being studied, and so the addition or deletion of sequences to a data set will require a new alignment to be made. In determining an alignment, and calculating a measure of difference between the sequences involved it is also necessary to consider the effects of transversions, transitions, and gaps. The bases in DNA strands pair through purine pyrimidine bonds, and so when aligning sequences, a change from purine to purine or pyrimidine to pyrimidine  transition  may be considered of less importance than a change from purine to pyrimidine  transversion . The importance given to transitions and transversions can therefore be varied to reﬂect their relative importance, and this may also depend on the particular sequences being considered. When aligning sequences it may be necessary to insert a gap in some sequences to align where insertion  deletion events have occurred. Again, the relative importance of inserting a gap, and also of extending that gap can be adjusted according to the perceived signiﬁcance of the event in the sequences under consideration [see Thompson et al.  1994 ]. is common with sequence analysis to use phylogenetic techniques to produce trees [see Swofford and Olsen  1990 ]. While these approaches are suitable when considering different species and genera, they are less appropriate for comparisons of closely related populations. Analysis of DNA sequence data is an area that is currently receiving further attention, and some of these developments are described in more detail in chapter 33.  It  5 FOLLOWING PLANT DISEASE: A CASE  STUDY  Molecular markers have been used in a wide range of studies with plant pathogenic fungi  see earlier . Although these can be reviewed, the literature available is considerable, and so a single case study is presented here that illustrates how the molecular epidemiology of a plant pathogen can be related directly to agricultural practice.  the volume of  One series of studies that has shown the range and limitations of molecular markers in following plant disease epidemiology is the investigation of basal stem rot  BSR  of oil palm by G. boninense. BSR was ﬁrst recognized in West Africa in 1915, and as oil palm was distributed through out the world, it was recorded in many other countries. The ﬁrst report in SE Asia was in 1931, and since that time BSR incidence has increased to the point where the lack of techniques for management of the disease is considered a major constraint to oil palm production in SE Asia [see Arifﬁn et al.  2000 ]. Ganoderma species attack a variety of tropical perennial crops including rubber, tea, and pineapple. In these instances the Ganoderma appears to be largely transmitted through the soil, possibly in plant debris, and spreading infection patches may be evident in ﬁelds. The species G. boninense occurs as a saprophyte on dead palms, particularly coconuts, but appears to be pathogenic only to oil palm. For some years transmission of G. boninense in oil palm was believed to be through the soil, as for other species, and disease control was attempted through practices that included digging large pits around infected palms  Turner 1981 . The ﬁrst attempt to use molecular methods to investigate the epidemiology of BSR in oil palm was made in the 1990s, when initial studies were made with iso-enzyme proﬁles  Miller et al. 1995 . Although some enzyme systems initially appeared useful for differ- entiating species, in G. boninense it was found that in general iso-enzyme proﬁles were either consistent, or showed considerable variation. Ganoderma is a basidiomycete that forms polyporpoid brackets on the outer surface of infected palms. The brackets are dikaryotic, and basidiospores are produced by meiosis. The mycelial form found in infected tissue is also generally dikaryotic, and some of the iso- enzyme variability may therefore be due to recombination events from the original fusion of monokaryotic basidio- spores. However, pectinase isoenzyme analysis identiﬁed a characteristic enzyme proﬁle that was consistent for nearly all Ganoderma isolates obtained from palm hosts  Miller et al. 1995; 2000 . Given the known involvement of pectin and pectin degradation in plant pathology, this ﬁnding may indicate a common mode of action for all of the palm associated Ganoderma species.  The ﬁrst DNA based method to be investigated in these studies was analysis of RFLPs derived from presumptive mtDNA  AT rich DNA . This relatively simple technique gave rather unusual results, in that different RFLPs were obtained from different cultures, suggesting considerable heterogeneity in the mitochondrial genome  Miller et al. 1999 . The RFLP proﬁles proved to be consistent among single spore isolates from a single basidiome, and so were considered to provide “parental line” ﬁngerprints, character- istic of the dikaryon. These RFLPs could therefore be used to deﬁne sibling families. This assumption was supported by monokaryon and dikaryon intercompatibility studies  Pilotti et al. 2000 .  Subsequent  investigation of molecular ﬁngerprinting methods including RAPDs and AFLP supported the bulk of the iso-enzyme studies and gave different proﬁles for isolates  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   derived from single spores from the same basidiome  Bridge et al. 2000; Pilotti et al. 2000 . When these molecular methods were applied to isolates obtained from single plantations and planting blocks it was found that nearly all of the isolates differed from each other, including isolates obtained from adjacent palms. This ﬁnding was again supported by intercompatibility studies  Miller et al. 1999; 2000; Pilotti et al. 2000 . These results could not have come about as a result of simple mycelial spread in the soil, as vegetative spread could be expected to result in at least some palms being infected by the same isolate. It was therefore concluded that infection could be due to one of two mechanisms, either singly or in combination. The ﬁrst was that there might have been mycelial spread from multiple inoculum sources, with virtually no cross infection. This would account for the molecular variability recorded, but would also require each infection to be the result of different infected debris. The second possibility was that infections were due to new dikaryons formed from fusion of monokaryons from individual spores [see Sanderson and Pilotti  1997 ; Sanderson et al.  2000 ].  Although the molecular markers studied showed sufﬁcient variability to identify individual isolates for local epidemiol- ogy, they did not show sufﬁcient conservation to allow the wider detection of the pathogen in the environment. BSR was considered to be due to the single species G. boninense, and although there is considerable uncertainty regarding species concepts in Ganoderma, some information is available on sequences within the rRNA gene cluster. Initial studies have shown that the ITS regions are relatively similar 0 across the genus, with most variation being found in the 3 terminal region of the ITS2 sequence  Moncalvo et al. 1995a,b . The ITS sequences obtained from multiple isolates of G. boninense showed very little sequence variation, and a short sequence of 16 bases in the ITS2 region was found to be unique to the species. A PCR primer has been derived from this region, and the combination of this and the universal rRNA primer ITS3 allowed the speciﬁc ampliﬁcation of G. boninense sequences from cultures, specimens, and infected palm material  Bridge et al. 2001 . Current surveys being undertaken by the Oil Palm Research Association in Papua New Guinea with the PCR based diagnostic are detecting G. boninense in the internal tissues of recently cut frond bases of young oil palms  Bridge et al. 2000; 2001 . This ﬁnding suggests that such cut surfaces may provide an entry route for spores. This mode of infection has been reported many times before for fungal pathogens of woody trees, and the initial results from the oil palm research suggest that the developmental state of the oil palm and other factors may also be important in the establishment of infection.  6 CONCLUSIONS  wide range of molecular features that can be used as markers at the population level for studying plant pathogenic fungi. The different markers will often reﬂect different levels of variation within and between plant pathogenic taxa, and may also reﬂect changes resulting from meiosis and recombina- tion. It is therefore possible to study the spread and dynamics of fungal populations on crop plants, and to determine the role of populations of the same fungus occurring on secondary hosts, in the soil or on debris. Molecular markers can also be used to determine the genetic integrity of host or variety speciﬁc groups, and can provide information on differences between pathogenic races. This information is fundamental to understanding the spread of fungal plant diseases, and is important in developing disease control strategies. The choice of marker will depend on the particular fungus under study, and the correct choice of markers may also provide informa- tion as to the role of spores or particular mating types in epidemiology. Variation in fungal pathogen genotype is the basis for developing methods to identify these pathogens using PCR. Recently, strains species speciﬁc molecular markers primers have been developed for several plant pathogenic fungi. There is unfortunately no single marker system that can be guaranteed to provide the desired level of discrimination for all fungi, and some initial screening of different methodologies may be required before a full study can be initiated.

Cleveland U.S. Department of Agriculture –Agricultural Research Service, New Orleans, Lousiana, USA  Zhi-Yuan Chen Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Lousiana, USA  1  INTRODUCTION  Mycotoxins are fungal metabolites that can contaminate foods and feeds, and exhibit toxic effects in higher organisms  Sharma and Salunkhe 1991  that consume the contaminated commodities. The regulatory guidelines and advisory limits issued by the United States Food and Drug Adminstration  FDA  on some contaminated commodities can facilitate severe economic losses to the growers. Therefore, mycotoxin contamination of foods and feeds is a serious food safety problem affecting the competitiveness of U.S. agriculture, both domestically and worldwide. Mycotoxins that signiﬁ- cantly impact agriculture include aﬂatoxins produced by Aspergillus ﬂavus and A. parasiticus, trichothecenes  in particular deoxynivalenol or DON  produced by Fusarium spp., ochratoxins produced by A. ochraceus and Penicillium viridicatum, and fumonisins produced by F. verticillioides  synonym, moniliforme, as used in some literature cited in the present article   Brown et al. 1998 . Cyclopiazonic acid produced by A. ﬂavus, can also be included on this list of signiﬁcant mycotoxins. Aﬂatoxins, potent liver toxins, and carcinogens comprise the most widely studied mycotoxins  CAST 1979; Diener et al. 1987; Payne 1998 , because of established results in their ability to induce animal diseases, particularly liver cancer in humans [reviewed in Eaton and Groopman  1994 ]. However, other mycotoxins such as DON, are of particular concern for the brewing industry which has cutoff levels as low as 0.5 ppm for DON in barley used in malting  Robens 2001 . In addition, recognizing the potential for fumonisins to cause animal or human health problems  Marasas 1996 , the FDA has now announced the availability of a ﬁnal guidance document entitled “Guidance  for Industry: Fumonisin Levels in Human Foods and Animal Feeds” in the November 9, 2001, Federal Registry. More than 50 countries have established or proposed regulations for controlling aﬂatoxins in foods and feeds, and at least 15 countries have regulations for levels of other mycotoxins  Haumann 1995 . The FDA has set limits of 20 ppb, total aﬂatoxins, for interstate commerce of food and feed and 0.05 ppb of aﬂatoxin M1 for sale of milk. Because of both food and feed safety concerns and the establishment of regulatory limits on DON and aﬂatoxins, it is estimated that over $1.5 billion in crop losses occur annually due to contamination of corn, cottonseed, peanut, and treenuts with aﬂatoxins and of wheat and barley with DON  Robens 2001 . An association between mycotoxin contamination and inadequate post harvest storage conditions has long been recognized. However, studies have revealed that seeds are contaminated with mycotoxins primarily at the preharvest stage [reviewed in Lisker and Lillehoj  1991 ]. Therefore, many current research strategies focus on preharvest control of mycotoxins [reviewed in Brown et al.  1998 ]. Maintaining good cultural and management practices that promote the general health of crops can reduce but not eliminate preharvest mycotoxin contamination. For example, insect resistant germplasm, such as corn transformed with the gene encoding Bacillus thuringiensis crystal protein  Bt maize , reduced levels of fumonisins  Dowd 2000 . Irrigation of peanut essentially prevents aﬂatoxin contamination of this crop, probably by preventing drought stress, known to induce contamination in peanut  Cole et al. 1985 . However, optimization of management practices to control mycotoxins is not always possible due to production costs, geographic location, or the nature of the production system for the  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   particular crop vulnerable to mycotoxins. In addition, even the best management practices are sometimes negated by biotic and abiotic factors that are hard to control and by extremes in environmental conditions. The complex epide- miology of A. ﬂavus on corn  Wicklow 1991  can drastically affect the outcome of measures to control aﬂatoxin contamination on this crop. Therefore, there is an urgent need for development and utilization of strategies involving state-of-the-art technologies to control preharvest mycotoxin contamination. The current article highlights recently published and high-impact research involving molecular- based technologies that has been accomplished and that enhances a host plant resistance strategy for controlling mycotoxin contamination.  2 MYCOTOXIN PREVENTION THROUGH  ENHANCEMENT OF HOST RESISTANCE IN CROPS   a    1999 ] and  b   Preharvest host resistance is a widely explored strategy for combatting fungal attack. By far, most studies aimed at the incorporation of antifungal resistance against mycotoxigenic fungi have been applied toward improvement of resistance against preharvest aﬂatoxin contamination in corn [reviewed in Brown et al.  1998 ]. With corn, the strategy of enhancing host resistance to aﬂatoxin contamination through breeding has gained prominence because of: the successful identiﬁcation of germplasm resistant to aﬂatoxin contami- nation [reviewed in Brown et al. the signiﬁcant advances in the identiﬁcation of natural resistance mechanisms and traits  Brown et al. 1998; 1999; Chen et al. 2001 . However, these investigations indicated that resistance to aﬂatoxin contamination involves multiple chromosome regions and several genes  Davis and Williams 1999 . Therefore, attempts to select for resistance traits in the development of commercial corn varieties, while maintaining desirable agronomic characteristics, have been slowed due to a failure to identify expressed genes and proteins involved in resistance. This is especially needed since resistance, thus far identiﬁed is in poor genetic backgrounds. Therefore, research is needed to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms that confer resistance in corn kernels and other crops that are vulnerable to aﬂatoxin contamination. These resistance mechanisms could then be used to enhance germplasm through marker-assisted breeding and or genetic engineering, two methods for employing the identiﬁed traits towards the development of resistant commercially-acceptable crops  Brown et al. 1999 . Gaining an understanding of the natural resistance mechanisms in corn could serve as “nature’s lesson” about the speciﬁc requirements for seed-based resistance against fungal attack. This information will help efforts to incorporate and enhance resistance in other crops vulnerable to aﬂatoxin contamination such as cottonseed, peanut, and tree nuts, and will perhaps even help efforts to  enhance resistance against other groups of mycotoxigenic fungi.  2.1 Development of Aﬂatoxin-Resistance  Screening Tools  Several screening tools have been developed and used to facilitate corn breeding for developing germplasm resistant to fungal growth and or aﬂatoxin contamination  King and Scott 1982 . Inoculation methods employed with corn include the pinbar inoculation technique  for inoculating kernels through husks with A. ﬂavus conidia , the silk inoculation technique, and infesting corn ears with insect larvae infected with A. ﬂavus conidia.  King and Scott 1982; Tucker et al. 1986 . Two resistant inbreds  Mp420 and Mp313E; Scott and Zummo 1988; Windham and Williams 1998  were discovered and tested in ﬁeld trials at different locations, using the pin- bar technique, and released as sources of resistant germplasm. A rapid laboratory kernel screening assay  KSA  was developed and used to study resistance to aﬂatoxin production in mature kernels  Brown et al. 1993; 1995 . The results of this study indicated the presence of two levels of resistance: at the pericarp and at the subpericarp level. The subpericarp level of resistance was shown to require a viable embryo  Brown et al. 1993 . KSA studies further demonstrated a role for pericarp waxes in kernel resistance  Guo et al. 1995; 1996  and highlighted quantitative and qualitative differences in pericarp wax between resistant and susceptible genotypes  Gembeh et al. 2001; Russin et al. 1997 . This research was all based on the prior identiﬁcation, during ﬁeld studies, of a resistant corn breeding population, GT-MAS:gk  Widstrom et al. 1987 .  The KSA also conﬁrmed sources of resistance among 31 inbreds tested in Illinois ﬁeld trials  Brown et al. 1995; Campbell and White 1995 , thus demonstrating that the KSA can be used, at least initially, to rank corn for its ﬁeld resistance to aﬂatoxin contamination. Subsequently, the KSA was used as a preliminary screen for resistance to aﬂatoxin contamination in kernels of maize inbreds selected for ear rot resistance in West and Central Africa  Brown et al. 2001a . The KSA has advantages over traditional ﬁeld screening techniques  Brown et al. 1995 , mainly because of the rapidity of the assay. However, ﬁeld trials are irreplaceable for conﬁrmation of resistance.  Recently, the KSA was improved by including a method to quantify fungal biomass using the b-glucuronidase  GUS  or green ﬂuorescent protein  GFP   Du et al. 1999; Windham and Williams 1998; Windham et al. 1999  reporter gene- containing A. ﬂavus tester strains. A. ﬂavus tester strains were genetically engineered with a gene construct consisting of the GUS reporter gene linked to an A. ﬂavus b-tubulin gene promoter for monitoring fungal growth  Brown et al. 1995; 1997  or with the reporter gene linked to an aﬂatoxin biosynthetic pathway gene which could also provide a quick and economical way to indirectly measure aﬂatoxin levels  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.    Brown-Jenco et al. 1998; Payne 1997 . Thus, it is now possible to accurately assess fungal infection levels and to predict the corresponding aﬂatoxin levels in the same kernels, as a result of fungal infection. This technology might be applied to screening for resistance to mycotoxin contami- nation by other mycotoxigenic fungi. Recently, an F. verticillioides strain, containing a GUS reporter gene was used in the KSA to demonstrate that this fungus is inhibited in aﬂatoxin-resistant genotypes  Brown et al. 2001b . This indicates that some resistance mechanisms may be generic for ear rotting mycotoxigenic fungi.  2.2  Identiﬁcation of Resistance-Associated Proteins  RAPs  and Natural Compounds in Corn That Inhibit Aspergillus ﬂavus Growth and Aﬂatoxin Contamination  Developing resistance to fungal infection in wounded as well as intact kernels would go a long way toward solving the aﬂatoxin problem  Payne 1992 . Studies demonstrating resistance in corn kernels subpericarp  wounded-kernel  have led to research for identiﬁcation of subpericarp resistance mechanisms. Examinations of kernel proteins of several genotypes revealed differences between genotypes resistant and susceptible to aﬂatoxin contamination  Guo et al. 1998 . Imbibed susceptible kernels, for example, showed decreased aﬂatoxin levels and contained germination-induced ribosome inactivating protein  RIP  and zeamatin  Guo et al. 1997 . Both zeamatin and RIP have been shown to inhibit A. ﬂavus growth in vitro  Guo et al. 1997 . In another study, two kernel proteins were identiﬁed from a resistant corn inbred  Tex6  which may contribute to resistance to aﬂatoxin contamination  Huang et al. 1997 . One protein, 28 kDa in size, inhibited A. ﬂavus growth, while a second, over 100 kDa in size, primarily inhibited toxin formation. When a commercial corn hybrid was inoculated with aﬂatoxin and nonaﬂatoxin-producing strains of A. ﬂavus at milk stage, one induced chitinase and one b-1,3-glucanase isoform was detected in maturing infected kernels, while another isoform was detected in maturing uninfected kernels  Ji et al. 2000 .  In another investigation, an examination of kernel protein proﬁles of 13 corn genotypes revealed that a 14 kDa trypsin inhibitor protein  TI  is present at relatively high concen- trations in seven resistant corn lines, but at low concentrations or is absent in six susceptible lines  Chen et al. 1998 . The mode of action of TI against fungal growth may be partially due to its inhibition of fungal-amylase, limiting A. ﬂavus access to simple sugars  Chen et al. 1999b  required not only for fungal growth, but also for toxin production  Woloshuk et al. 1997 . The TI also demonstrated antifungal activity against other mycotoxigenic species  Chen et al. 1999a . The identiﬁcation of these proteins may provide markers for plant breeders, and may facilitate the cloning and introduction of  Figure 1 Strategy for enhancing host plant resistance to aﬂatoxin contamination. The research approach being used to identify and employ resistance factors, such as resistance- associated proteins  RAPs  that are identiﬁed in aﬂatoxin- resistant corn lines. After resistant germplasm is identiﬁed, various tools are used to characterize the expression of resistance, such as KSA-based studies, GUS GFP reporter constructs, and seed physiology studies. These can lead to RAP identiﬁcation protocols such as proteome analysis. Genes corresponding to RAPs can be cloned, and clones then used for QTL studies, plant transformation, or marker-assisted breeding.  antifungal genes through genetic engineering into other aﬂatoxin-susceptible crops  Figure 1 .  A recent investigation into corn kernel resistance  Chen et al. 2001  determined that both constitutive and induced proteins are required for resistance to aﬂatoxin production. It also showed that one major difference between resistant and susceptible genotypes is that resistant lines constitutively express higher levels of antifungal proteins compared to susceptible lines. The real function of these high levels of constitutive antifungal proteins may be to delay fungal invasion, and consequent aﬂatoxin formation, until other antifungal proteins can be synthesized to form an active defense system.

The increased reproducibility, reliability, and accuracy of 2-D gel electrophoresis is due to advances in technology, such as immobilized pH gradient  IPG  gel strips and sophisticated computerized 2-D gel analysis software  Appel et al. 1997; Go¨rg et al. 1998 . Endosperm and embryo proteins from several resistant and susceptible genotypes have been compared using large format 2-D gel electrophoresis, and over a dozen such protein spots, either unique or 5-fold upregulated in resistant lines, have been identiﬁed, isolated from preparative 2-D gels and analyzed using ESI-MS MS after in-gel digestion with trypsin  Chen et al. 1999a; 2000; 2002 . These proteins can be grouped into three categories based on their peptide sequence homology:  a  storage proteins, such as GLB1, GLB2, and late embryogenesis abundant proteins  LEA3, LEA14 ;  b  stress-responsive proteins, such as aldose reductase  ALD , a glyoxalase I protein  GLX1 , and a 16.9 kDa heat shock protein, and  c  antifungal proteins, which include TI.  Thus far, no investigation has been conducted to determine the possible direct involvement of stress-related proteins in host fungal resistance. Heretofore, most RAPs identiﬁed have had antifungal activities. However, increased temperatures and drought, which often occur together, are major factors associated with aﬂatoxin contamination of maize kernels  Payne 1998 . Other studies have found that drought stress imposed during grain ﬁlling reduces dry matter accumulation in kernels. This often leads to cracks in the seed and provides an easy entry site to fungi and insects. Possession of unique or of higher levels of hydrophilic storage or stress-related proteins, such as the aforementioned, may put resistant lines in an advantageous position over susceptible genotypes in the ability to synthesize proteins and defend against pathogens under stress conditions. Therefore, the necessary require- ments for developing commercially-useful, aﬂatoxin-resistant maize lines may include, aside from antifungal proteins, a high level of expression of stress-related proteins. Further studies including physiological and biochemical characteriz- ation, genetic mapping, plant transformation using RAP genes, and marker-assisted breeding should clarify the roles of stress-related RAPs in kernel resistance.  2.2.2 Natural Compounds That Affect Mycotoxin  Biosynthesis  Several compounds have been identiﬁed in corn which may have regulatory effects on the aﬂatoxin and trichothecene biosynthetic process. The compound 4-acetyl-benzoxazolin- 2-one  ABOA , which was isolated from maize lines tolerant to F. graminearum, strongly inhibited acetyl-deoxynivalinol production at 5 mM, aﬂatoxin production at 2 mg ml, and feeding by maize weevils at 1000 ppm  Miller et al. 1996 .  Steryl esters from maize signiﬁcantly increased aﬂatoxin production by some A. ﬂavus strains at 0.3 and 1.0 mg ml  Norton and Dowd 1996 . Anthocyanins and related ﬂavonoids, some of which occur naturally in maize kernels, inhibited aﬂatoxin production by more than 50% at 0.76 mM  Norton 1999 . More highly glycosylated forms of the anthocyanins tended to be less effective in inhibiting aﬂatoxin production  Norton 1999 . Carotenoids containing an alpha- ionone type ring tended to be more effective inhibitors of aﬂatoxin production by A. ﬂavus, with some having an I50 of about 6 mM  Norton 1997 . Although most strains of A. ﬂavus exposed to beta-carotene at 50 mg ml had aﬂatoxin production inhibited by 90% or more, some peanut derived strains were less sensitive  Wicklow et al. 1998 . In vitro studies indicated plant peroxidase could greatly enhance the ability of plant chemicals to inhibit spore germination and hyphal growth of F. graminearum  Dowd et al. 1997 . A. ﬂavus was considerably more resistant to quinone products potentially produced by plant peroxidases compared to F. graminearum and F. verticillioides  moniliforme   Dowd et al. 1997 . In addition, volatile compounds from corn and cotton, which are products of the lipoxygenase pathway, were shown to have effects upon aﬂatoxin biosynthesis and fungal development in vitro [reviewed in Bhatnagar et al.  2001 ].  2.3 Plant Breeding Strategies for Enhancing Host  Resistance to Mycotoxigenic Fungi  Several resistant inbreds among the 31 tested in Illinois ﬁeld trials  Campbell and White 1995  and highlighted through the KSA  Brown et al. 1995 , have been incorporated into an aﬂatoxin-resistance breeding program whose major objective is to improve elite Midwestern corn lines such as B73 and Mo17. In this program, the inheritance of resistance of inbreds in crosses with B73 and or Mo17 was determined  Hamblin and White 2000; Walker and White 2001; White et al. 1995b; 1998 , and in the case of several highly resistant inbreds, genetic dominance was indicated. Overall, results indicated that selection for resistance to Aspergillus ear rot and aﬂatoxin production should be effective, and that develop- ment of resistant inbreds for use in breeding commercial hybrids should be successful  White et al. 1995a .  Chromosome regions associated with resistance to A. ﬂavus and inhibition of aﬂatoxin production in corn have been identiﬁed through Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism  RFLP  analysis in three “resistant” lines  R001, LB31, and Tex6  in the Illinois breeding program, after mapping populations were developed using B73 and or Mo17 elite inbreds as the “susceptible” parents  White et al. 1995b; 1998 . In some cases, chromosomal regions were associated with resistance to Aspergillus ear rot and not aﬂatoxin inhibition, and vice versa, whereas other chromo- somal regions were found to be associated with both traits. This suggests that these two traits may be at least partially under separate genetic control. Also, it was observed that  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   variation can exist in the chromosomal regions associated with Aspergillus ear rot and aﬂatoxin inhibition in different mapping populations, suggesting the presence of different genes for resistance in the different identiﬁed resistance germplasm. The RFLP technology may provide the basis for employing the strategy of pyramiding different types of resistances into commercially viable germplasm, while avoiding the introduction of undesirable traits. Another Quantitative Trait Loci  QTL  mapping program was undertaken using a mapping population created from a resistant inbred Mp313E and a susceptible one, Va35  Davis and Williams 1999 , and regions on chromosomes, associated with resistance to aﬂatoxin contamination, were revealed. Other work using this technology is attempting to pyramid insect and fungal into commercial germplasm  Guo et al. 2000; Widstrom et al. 2003 .  resistance genes  Breeding strategies to enhance resistance to A. ﬂavus infection are being carried out in other crops vulnerable to aﬂatoxin contamination such as peanut and tree nuts. Promising sources of resistant peanut germplasm have been identiﬁed from a core collection representing the entire peanut germplasm collection  Holbrook et al. 1995 , although resistance screening has proven to be a difﬁcult task with this crop  Holbrook et al. 1997 . Promising peanut germplasm has less than acceptable agronomic characteristics, and is thus being hybridized with lines with commercially acceptable features. Resistant lines also are being crossed to pool resistances to aﬂatoxin production. Thus, some success has been achieved in identifying resistant peanut germplasm, and ﬁeld studies are being conducted by various researchers to verify this trait.  Among tree nuts, strategies for controlling preharvest aﬂatoxin formation by breeding for host resistance have been studied mainly in almonds  Gradziel et al. 1995 . The approach has been to integrate multiple genetic mechanisms for control of not only Aspergillus spp. but also insects. Resistance to fungal colonization has been shown to be present in the undamaged seed coat of several advanced breeding selections and is further being pursued through breeding genetic engineering of resistance to A. ﬂavus growth in kernel tissues. Genotypes are also under development that produce low amounts of aﬂatoxin following fungal infections  Gradziel and Dandekar 1999 .  Naphthoquinones in walnut hulls delayed germination of A. ﬂavus conidia and were capable of inhibiting growth of the fungus at higher concentrations  Mahoney et al. 2000; Molyneux et al. 2000 . These compounds also appeared to have a regulatory effect on aﬂatoxin biosynthesis and may be involved in resistance to aﬂatoxin contamination of walnut. Results seen here could lead to breeding applications to enhance resistance in walnut to aﬂatoxin contamination using naphthoquinone derivatives as selectable markers.  Investigations have also been conducted with ﬁgs and pistachios to identify the mode of infection of the crops by A. ﬂavus and develop strategies to identify germplasm with agronomically desirable characteristics and resistance to fungal infection  Doster et al. 1995 . However, until more is  known about the nature of selectable resistance markers associated with reduced aﬂatoxin contamination in crops other than corn, breeding for insect resistance, or better management of insects which vector aﬂatoxigenic fungi may be a more viable immediate approach to manage aﬂatoxin contamination.  Recent studies indicate that naturally occurring resistance may reduce invasion of crops by other economically important mycotoxigenic fungi. For example, resistance to head blight in wheat varieties was correlated with a reduction in contamination with DON  Bai et al. 2001 . Further investigations utilizing differentially resistant wheat germ- plasm may lead to the identiﬁcation of selectable resistance markers useful in breeding for reduced DON contamination in wheat.  2.4 Genetic Engineering Strategies to Enhance  Host Resistance to Mycotoxin Contamination  Plant breeding for resistance is practical when a large germplasm pool exists with differential resistance in the crop, such as exists in corn. However, genetic engineering for resistance may be essential for crops such as cotton which seems to have little resistance to aﬂatoxin contamination of its seed  Cotty 1989 . Extensive research has focused upon identifying genes encoding antifungal proteins effective against mycotoxigenic fungi. Bacterial chloroperoxidase  CPO   Wolffram et al. 1988  and its gene have been evaluated both in vitro in laboratory assays  Jacks et al. 1999  and in vivo in enhancing fungal disease resistance in transgenic tobacco plants  Rajasekaran et al. 2000b . In in vitro bioassays using A. ﬂavus as the test organism, CPO greatly reduced the viability of A. ﬂavus conidia  Jacks et al. 1999  and transgenic tobacco expressing the CPO gene demonstrated signiﬁcant resistance to attack by Colletotrichum destructivum  Rajasekaran et al. 2000b .  In another study, a small lytic peptide, D4E1, demon- strated broad spectrum antimicrobial activity and convincing inhibitory activity against A. ﬂavus in vitro  Rajasekaran et al. 2001 , thus indicating the possibility of transforming plants with the gene encoding D4E1 to reduce infection of seed with toxigenic fungi. In further substantiation of this strategy, the D4E1 gene when transformed into tobacco was shown to greatly enhance resistance to C. destructivum  Cary et al. 2000 . Cotton is being transformed with CPO and D4E genes with the hope that aﬂatoxin contamination of cottonseed can be reduced  Chlan et al. 1999; Rajasekaran et al. 1999; 2000a .  Mechanisms of mycotoxin biosynthesis and regulation have been investigated extensively  Bhatnagar et al. 2002; Cleveland and Bhatnagar 1992; Desjardins and Proctor 2001 . The goal is to identify weak links that can be exploited to control mycotoxin contamination through genetic engineer- ing of plants. The ﬁnding that trichothecenes contribute to the virulence of F. graminearum on wheat and maize has  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   identiﬁed such a weak link. If production of trichothecenes increases pathogen virulence, then increased plant resistance to the toxin should increase plant resistance to the pathogen. Three genes that increase plant resistance to trichothecenes have recently been identiﬁed, and whether such genes also can increase plant resistance to F. graminearum is under investigation. Two trichothecene resistance genes are fungal genes that encode proteins that reduce the toxicity of trichothecenes. TRI101 from F. sporotrichioides encodes trichothecene 3-O-acetyltransferase which converts tricho- thecenes to less toxic derivatives  Kimura et al. 1998; McCormick et al. 1999 . PDR5 from yeast encodes a multidrug resistance transporter protein that transports trichothecenes extracellularly and is similar to TRI12, a trichothecene biosynthetic gene  Alexander et al. 1999; Balzi et al. 1994 . Transgenic expression of either TRI101 or PDR5 increased resistance of tobacco to trichothecenes  Muhitch et al. 2000 . Wheat and barley lines expressing TRI101 and PDR5 are being tested for resistance to F. graminearum  Okubara et al. 2000 .  Trichothecenes are potent inhibitors of protein synthesis and are believed to bind to the 60S ribosomal protein L3  RPL3 . A rice gene encoding RPL3 was modiﬁed to change amino acid 258 from tryptophan to cysteine, a change that confers trichothecene resistance to yeast. Transgenic expression of the modiﬁed Rpl3, increased resistance of tobacco to trichothecenes  Harris and Gleddie 2001 . Maize, wheat, and barley lines expressing the modiﬁed Rpl3 gene are being tested for resistance to F. graminearum  Harris and Gleddie 2001 .  No analogous weak link in the aﬂatoxin biosynthetic pathway has been discovered that can be exploited in a similar host resistance strategy, nor has a clear role for aﬂatoxin in fungal virulence been demonstrated. However, the aﬂatoxin biosynthetic pathway and the gene cluster comprising genes that govern this pathway, including a key regulatory gene  aﬂR , have been characterized  Bhatnagar et al. 2002 . Also, the regulation of these genes during invasion of the host plant is being investigated using a genomics approach. This approach is based upon the fact that certain plant-derived natural products apparently have regulatory effects on aﬂatoxin biosynthesis [as recently reviewed in Bhatnagar et al.  2001  and reported in recent publications cited in this article: Miller et al. 1996; Norton 1999; Norton and Dowd 1996; Wicklow et al. 1998].  Genetic engineering may provide innovative solutions to prevent the accumulation of fumonisins in Fusarium-infected maize. One approach currently under development is detoxiﬁcation of fumonisins by enzymes introduced into maize via genetic engineering. Enzymes that detoxify and degrade fumonisins have been identiﬁed from Exophiala spinifera, a black yeast found on moldy maize kernels. The initial steps in fumonisin detoxiﬁcation are ester hydrolysis followed by oxidative deamination to produce derivatives that lack the free amino function that is believed to be important for toxicity  Blackwell et al. 1999 . Genes encoding the deesteriﬁcation and deamination enzymes have been cloned  and are being expressed in transgenic maize to evaluate their effect on fumonisin accumulation and ear rot symptoms  Duvick 2001 .  The gene encoding the antifungal protein, TI, previously shown to be correlated with corn kernel resistance, was transformed into and expressed in both tobacco and cotton. Fungal growth inhibition assays of transgenic tobacco expressing TI protein showed efﬁcacy against A. ﬂavus, but not at the levels observed with extracts from tobacco transformed with genes encoding CPO or D4E1  Cary et al. 2000; Rajasekaran et al. 2000b . The gene encoding TI also has been transformed into cotton, but no inhibitory activity has yet been noted in extracts from transgenic plants.  It is well documented that insect injury can provide a port of entry by mycotoxigenic fungi and that crops containing the B. thuringiensis  Bt  gene encoding an insecticidal protein, have shown reduced levels of mycotoxin contamination  Dowd 2000 . Currently, a binary vector is being used in this laboratory to express both the antifungal D4E1 gene and a synthetic anti-insecticidal gene, cryIA c , of B. thuringiensis in tobacco and cotton. Successful expression of these genes under independent promoters should provide both fungal and insect resistance in cotton, thus potentially reducing the amount of fungal entry through insect injury sites as well as retarding the growth of the aﬂatoxin producing fungus in cotton bolls and seed.  3 CONCLUSIONS  Since it is unlikely that preharvest mycotoxin contamination of crops will be reduced signiﬁcantly through careful cultural practices, control of these problems will likely be dependent upon the development and introduction into the commercial market, of germplasm, resistant to the growth of mycotoxi- genic species, and or biosynthesis of toxins by these species. The identiﬁcation of resistance traits in corn and other crops can, through marker-assisted breeding, facilitate a more rapid development of resistant, commercially-acceptable germ- plasm. Genetic engineering provides a tool especially useful for introducing resistance genes into crops with little natural genetic diversity  e.g., cotton , and for testing the efﬁcacy of putative resistance genes.  Studies identifying compounds that affect mycotoxin biosynthesis offer hope to researchers. Limiting fungal growth in crops is an important aspect of host resistance, however, obtaining zero growth of fungi capable of exploiting a variety of different substrates, such as the facultative pathogen A. ﬂavus, may be difﬁcult to achieve. Therefore, the identiﬁcation of a natural compound that blocks mycotoxin biosynthesis might be the closest we come to discovering a “magic bullet.” Nevertheless, the investigations discussed in this chapter, using molecular-based technologies to identify and characterize various resistance mechanisms in crops susceptible to mycotoxin contamination, and against different mycotoxigenic fungi, are building a foundation which can lead to the implementation of a successful gene pyramiding  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

Glare AgResearch, Lincoln, New Zealand  1  INTRODUCTION  Fungi have been known to attack insects and mites for thousands of years. Although the causative agent of fungal disease of insects was not always understood, insects infected with fungi were recorded by the Chinese in the seventh century  Tanada and Kaya 1993  and drawings of Cordyceps infections abound in early 18th and 19th century literature. The ﬁrst experimental demonstration of a microbe as a disease-causing organism was by Agostino Bassi, published in 1835 – 1836, in Italy, with the silkworm pathogenic fungus, Beauveria bassiana. He demonstrated that the fungus causes insect death and could be transmitted to other silkworms. It was not long after the ﬁrst demonstration of the devastating impact of an entomopathogenic fungus on a beneﬁcial insect that it occurred to researchers that disease may be a useful method for control of insect pests. Pasteur is credited with the early proposition that fungi could be used to control a pest insect. He proposed that a fungus could be used against Phylloxera in grapevines, a pest eventually controlled using copper solutions. However, it was the Nobel Prize winning researcher, Elie Metchnikoff, who ﬁrst developed a fungus as a practical control agent for application to a pest. Working in Russia from 1878, Metchnikoff developed the fungus Metarhizium anisopliae for control of the cereal cockchafer, Anisoplia austriaca, then a devastating pest. Metchnikoff carried out the ﬁrst successful infection experiments with larvae of A. austriaca and the sugar beet weevil, Cleonus punctiventris, and initiated mass production of the fungus for ﬁeld experiments  Zimmermann et al. 1995 . With the mass production of M. anisopliae, Metchnikoff applied a biotechnological approach to entomopathogenic fungi for the ﬁrst time, a precursor to the development of biopesticides. The ﬁrst actual ﬁeld application of M. anisopliae in Russia was left to Krassilstchik  1888  who mass produced the  fungus and applied it control.  in the ﬁeld for sugar-beet weevil  Despite the early discovery of their potential, it was only recently that entomopathogenic fungi have been utilized successfully in biocontrol programs. The fungi are often effective as natural control agents, but their activity is very dependent upon environmental conditions. Many have restrictive temperature ranges for germination, infection, and sporulation, or high humidity requirements for sporula- tion and spore germination. In some cases, the infective stage is not robust and, as many of the most promising candidate fungi for pest control have lost the ability to form persistent stages such as resting spores, storage and application can be problematic. Variation within species or clusters of species has not been well understood, thus strain selection has not often been attempted or not been possible. The application of biotechnology to the study and development of entomopatho- genic fungi has the potential to overcome some of these limitations. Biotechnology has contributed to all areas in the development of entomopathogenic fungi as biocontrol agents, from identiﬁcation to formulation. This chapter reviews the contribution of biotechnology to the development of entomopathogenic fungi.  2 BIOPESTICIDE POTENTIAL OF ENTOMOPATHOGENIC FUNGI  There are a number of methods for using entomopathogenic fungi against insect pests. Eilenberg et al.  2001  recognized four main strategies:  a  classical biological control, the intentional introduction of an exotic strain for long term, unmanaged control,  b  inoculative biocontrol, the intentional release of endemic strains for long-term unmanaged biocontrol of endemic pests,  c  inundative biological control,  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

Inundative biological control usually relies on the development of biopesticides based on pathogenic microbes, which is the most obvious application of biotechnology to entomopathogenic fungi.  to enhance fungal  2.1 Biopesticides Based on Fungi  Application of fungi in mass inoculations against insect pests began with Krassilstchik in 1888. Indeed, such was the optimism at that time Krassilstchik conﬁdently predicted “the idea of controlling insects by means of artiﬁcially induced epidemics, an idea expressed some 20 years ago by scholars, has become a practically feasible one, which in the future will be perfected and broadly utilized”  Krassilstchik 1888 . Unfortunately, progress has been much slower than what was predicted. While progress in the early 1900s was promising, the discovery and application of effective chemical pesticides in the 1930 – 1940s reduced interest in the use of insect pathogens. Insect pathogenic fungi were more difﬁcult to use, and it was not until environmental and health problems associated with the use of chemical insecticides became apparent in the 1960s that interest in fungal biopesticides again increased. Currently, most biopesticides based on entomopathogenic fungi include either B. bassiana or M. anisopliae  Table 1 . These two species, the so-called muscardine fungi, have broad host ranges, although individual strains may be restricted in the number of insect species that they can attack. These species are relatively easy to produce, as they produce vast amounts of asexual conidia in culture as well as on insects. They are generally considered to have low mammalian toxicity and few nontarget impacts have been reported  see Section 6 .  in the market  w  w  and Mycotrol  A number of biopesticides have been based on the white muscardine fungus, B. bassiana  Table 1 . The better known products are those of Emerald BioAgriculture  a merger between Mycotech Corporation and Auxein Corporation  . BotaniGard is a liquid such as BotaniGard emulsion formulation of B. bassiana conidia while Mycotrol is based on powdered conidia. There are a number of other products based on Beauveria spp. registered around the world. In France, Ostrinile, based on B. bassiana has been produced for many years for corn earworm  Ostinia nubalis  control, while in India the biopesticide Dispel is sold for control of podborers  Reddy et al. 2001 . Similarly, a number of biopesticides are based on the green muscardine fungus, Metarhizium spp. Biopesticides based on Metarhizium spp. have had a long  if not always successful  history. In the 1980s, Bayer Corporation produced a biopesticide, Bio1020, which was a formulation of M. anisopliae with excellent shelf life and application potential. It was primarily developed for control of black vine weevil  Reinecke et al. 1990 , but was tested against a number of other pests [e.g., Tabata  1992 ]. However, the product was not commercially successful for a  reasons  number of  Reinecke et al. 1991  and was unavailable for many years. Recently, Bio1020 has reappeared in the market as Taenuree, sold by Earth BioSciences  http:  www.taensa.com products-taenure.html . A recent success story for biopesticides has been the development of novel strains of M. anisopliae var. acridium for locust control in several countries. Initially, a strain of this fungus was developed in Africa under a program called LUBILOSA, which led to the biopesticide “Green Muscle”  Lomer et al. 2001 . This program has inspired development of indigenous strains of M. anisopliae var. acridium in other countries. For example, in Australia the success of the LUBILOSA program has been duplicated with the develop- ment of Green Guarde based on an Australian isolate of M. anisopliae var. acridium  Milner 2000 .  Other biopesticides based on Metarhizium are sold around the world. In Australia, an isolate of M. anisopliae has also been developed as a commercially available biopesticide for the control of sugarcane scarabs, particularly the grayback canegrub, Dermolepida albohirtum. BioCanee is effective when applied at 33 kg ha  1 £ 1010 conidia m  before ﬁlling-  in of the planting furrow  Samson et al. 1999 , giving 50 – 60% control of grayback larvae  Logan et al. 2000 . In Columbia, a product based on several entomopathogenic fungi  Micobiol  has been tested against Prodiplosis longiﬁla  Diptera: Cecidomyiidae  infesting tomatoes, but was not as effective as conventional control products  Delgado et al. 1999 .  Several other entomopathogenic fungi have been developed as commercially available biopesticides  Table 1 . Fungi such as Paecilomyces and Verticillium are similar in action to Metarhizium and Beauveria. However, a more unusual fungus for development as a biopesticide is the aquatic active, Lagenidium giganteum. This Oomycete fungus is active against mosquito larvae and has been developed into the biopesticide Laginexe in California and is now sold by AgraQuest, Inc. In ﬁeld trials against the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus, Laginexe compared favorably with Vectobace  based on Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis , in terms of persistence of control  Hallmon et al. 2000 . No biopesticides are currently produced using any species of the Entomophthorales, which is a large order containing mainly entomopathogenic fungi. These fungi, which typically forcibly discharge their primary conidia, often cause large-scale epizootics among insects. This suggests huge potential for development of this group of fungi as mass applied biopesticides. However, problems in production and stabilization of the fragile conidia or the more durable resting spores have not been overcome, and economic products are not feasible at this time.  Biopesticide production has increased in many Central and South American nations and some are not strictly commercial. For example, in Cuba where, as a result of the trade embargo, it has been difﬁcult to obtain cheap chemical pesticides, a biopesticide production industry has grown to ﬁll the gap. Under the Cuban Ministry of Agriculture, decentralized laboratories provide insects, nematodes, and  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   entomopathogens  bacteria, fungi, and viruses  throughout Cuba’s 15 provinces  Rosset and Moore 1997 . These “Centres for the Production of Entomophages and Entomo- pathogens”  CREEs  have facilitated the rapid adoption of IPM systems in crops previously managed under pesticide- based systems. Several fungal entomopathogens are produced for a number of pests, including B. bassiana for control of coleopteran pests and Verticillium lecanii for whiteﬂy, Bemisia tabaci. In 1994, 781 metric tonnes of B. bassiana, 196 of V. lecanii and 142 of M. anisopliae were produced by the production centers. Similarly, biopesticides based M. anisopliae are produced by some Central American sugar plantations for the control of pests. The sugar companies have their own production facilities for Metar- hizium and Beauveria [e.g., Badilla  2000  and Grimm  2001 ]. These localized production facilities produce sufﬁcient quantities of fungal inoculum for control of pests such as the coffee berry borer, the diamondback moth, and spittlebugs.  2.2 Production, Formulation, and Application  Production of entomopathogenic fungi has not advanced greatly beyond the use of simple grains as substrates for the Deuteromycete fungi, such as Metarhizium and Beauveria. For many other entomopathogenic fungi, especially among the Entomophthorales, growth in culture is difﬁcult or has yet to be achieved. Both liquid and solid substrates have been substantially investigated  Burgess 1998 . Two-stage sys- tems, where both liquid and solid substrates are used, have occasionally proved successful. For example, fermentation to produce hyphae to use as starter cultures is now a widespread practice. There are number of advantages to using liquid cultures as starter cultures:  a  the competitive ability of the fungus is enhanced, reducing the risk of contamination from other microbes,  b  growth is more rapid in the early stages,  c  the liquid culture can be screened for contamination prior to use, and  d  the liquid ensures even coverage of the solid substrate  Jenkins et al. 1998 . Liquid starter cultures are commonly used to begin solid substrate production. However, experience with M. anisopliae in our laboratory is probably typical of many other laboratories, where inoculation of rice grains with fermenter broth of M. anisopliae hyphal bodies gave no improvement in production over the use of conidia from plate cultures  Glare et al. unpublished data . Production on grains is generally in the range of 108 – 1010 conidia g of dry substrate [e.g., Feng et al.  1994 ], taking between 2 and 3 weeks to reach maturity at optimal temperatures. Interest- ingly, Metarhizium and Beauveria sporulate better when the substrate is relatively poor in nutrient content. When grains were supplemented with sugars and yeast additives, less conidia per gram of substrate was obtained than with grains alone  Nelson et al. 1996 . Similarly, in Brazil, M. anisopliae has been found to produce conidial yields of 5 – 15 times higher using rice bran rice husk substrate mixtures than yields  usually obtained for rice grains, with viabilities of higher than 85%  Dorta et al. 1990 .  The production of Green Musclee M. anisopliae for locusts in Africa used a two-stage production system with fermenter production of inoculum used to inoculate rice  Cherry et al. 1999 . The process requires relatively low capital investment, but has high labor costs. As with production of most fungi, high variability in yield was reported between batches, and this variability was only partly accounted for by temperature and duration of incubation  Cherry et al. 1999 .  A method that showed some promise in the 1980s was the preparation of dried mycelium. Hyphal bodies were harvested by ﬁltration, washed with water to remove culture medium residue, and then coated with a sugar solution before drying. This method was used with M. anisopliae and B. bassiana  Pereira and Roberts 1990 . They found that conidial production was similar to other methods after storage for up to 4.5 months at 48C and could be superior to other methods with respect to storage at room temperature, however no products at present use this technology.  The Emerald Bio production plant  previously Mycotech  in Butte, Montana, represents the technological end of the production of entomopathogenic fungi. Largely utilized for the production of B. bassiana, it is a “state of the art” dedicated facility, with in-line sterilization and large temperature controlled growth facilities. The actual pro- duction method is a trade secret, but is based on fermented starter cultures and solid substrate growth and sporulation. This highly technical facility contrasts with the numerous low technology “factories” producing fungi for insect control in China and much of Latin America.  Compatibility between production,  formulation, and application techniques is vital for the successful use of microbial biopesticides. The LUBILOSA program for locust control used Metarhizium in oil formulations and ULV spraying, which required lipophilic conidia for easy suspension in oils  Jenkins et al. 1998 . While production of submerged conidia was seen as having many advantages, the resulting conidia were hydrophilic and lost viability quickly. Therefore, production on grains remains the standard with the locust products. For many years, approaches to the use of entomopathogenic fungi involved point release  “classical biological control”  or simple application of conidia, formulated in water with wetting agents. However, appro- priate formulation can advance entomopathogenic fungi from curiosity to effective biocontrol agents. It has been an area that has beneﬁted from the application of biotechnology. Formulation has been important in terms of improved survival during storage, persistence in the ﬁeld  such as UV and desiccation tolerance , and ease of application.  The LUBILOSA program, where M. anisopliae var. acridium was developed into a biopesticide for locust control in Africa, is an excellent example of formulation overcoming environmental constraints. As locusts live in hot, dry climates and M. anisopliae conidia require high humidity to germinate, it seems impossible that an entomopathogenic fungus could  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   formulation problem than most of  successfully control the pest. However, formulating Meta- rhizium conidia in nonevaporative diluents such as oils allowed the conidia to attach and germinate on susceptible locusts. M. anisopliae oil formulations are especially useful at low relative humidities  Bateman 1997 . There have been several interesting studies on formulating hyphal material from members of the Entomophthorales. These fungi, because of the fragile nature of the mycelium and conidia, pose a much greater the Deuteromycetes, which has contributed to their lack of commercial success. McCabe and Soper  1985  patented a process of drying the mycelium of Zoophthora radicans and coating it with sugar, as a method for long-term storage. More recently, Shah et al.  1998  demonstrated algination as a method for formulating Erynia neoaphidis mycelium. An important area of formulation and production is the drying of conidia of entomopathogenic fungi. Moore et al.  1996  have shown that survival of conidia of M. anisopliae was highest at low  , 5%  relative humidity, therefore, this is an important aspect of producing a stable product.  Use of appropriate application techniques that are suited for the application of biopesticide to the target pest is an obvious, but often neglected aspect of biopesticide use. Advances in chemical pesticide applications have slowly ﬁltered through to use with biopesticides, such as ultra-low volume  ULV  application of M. anisopliae for locust control  Lomer et al. 2001 . Nonevaporative diluents such as oil are required to take advantage of ULV spraying. Rotary atomizers have been used for low volume oil formulations and ULVs for less than 5 l ha. Electrostatically-charged ULV sprayers have been investigated for better coverage on leaf undersides  Sopp et al. 1989 . Generally, application of fungal-based biopesticides has been with conventional equipment and research has focused on spray coverage, droplet size, and placement  i.e., penetration to the underside of leaves . Hydraulic spray systems have been used to apply water-based formulations on crops, air-blast and air-assist technologies are primarily used for low volume applications in ﬁelds and orchards. The best success has been with large numbers of droplets with high spore content per droplet  Goettel et al. 2000 .  Introducing large amounts of fungal inoculum into the soil and securing an even spread remains a problem. Many methods have been tested for application of fungal containing granules or conidia on grains to soil, including using seed drills for subsurface application, and hand application. The problems of spread of conidia after application to soil has lead to the Melolontha and researchers are developing an area wide approach based on augmentative applications of Beauveria brongniartii for long term suppression of pest populations  Hajek et al. 2001 .  2.3 Novel Strategies for Biopesticide Use  In some cases, preexisting application technology may not be well suited to the requirements of a biological agent. One  approach that takes advantage of the biological nature of entomopathogenic fungi is the “lure and infect” approach, best demonstrated by research on Z. radicans for control of diamondback moth. Furlong et al.  1995  have shown that using pheromone lures to attract moths to traps containing sporulating Z. radicans can result in contamination and spread of the fungus through the target population. Such an approach has been investigated for use with scarab beetles in the Azores  Klein and Lacey 1999 . Autodissemination of entomopatho- genic fungi for control of Popillia japonica in the Azores used a trapping system of commercially available attractants with M. anisopliae. The viability of conidia in traps after 6 days was found to be about 35%, but the basic process was successful into pest populations. Another approach has been bait stations, such as those used with termites  Rath 2000 . The entomopathogenic fungus is placed in a trap together with a food-based bait, and the insect becomes contaminated when it enters the trap. The general approach is similar for lure-and-infect and bait stations: attract the insect to an inoculum source, rather than broadcast application to secure contact between pest and disease.  introducing fungi  for  Use of attractants is not restricted to luring to a single trap. Smith et al.  1999  investigated the use of vegetable fat pellets formulated with pheromone and B. bassiana to control the larger grain borer, Prostephanus truncates. Signiﬁcantly higher numbers of beetles were attracted to pellets containing pheromone than those without pheromone incorporated. The pellets containing pheromone and fungus could be stored for several weeks, indicating this may be a useful strategy to increase the utility of entomopathogenic fungi.  Development of biopesticides for social insects has been problematic because the method by which social insects defend against disease is mainly behaviorally-based rather than biologically-based. For example, hymenopteran wasps such as Vespula spp. have well-developed hygienic behaviour which includes removing all suspected material from a nest before contamination of nestmates occurs. Vespula do not reuse nests and, therefore, disease in one season does not result in disease in another season. Behavioral defense against disease requires novel application and formulation methods for any chance of success for entomopathogenic fungi. Similarly, termites are highly susceptible to entomopatho- genic fungi, including M. anisopliae and B. bassiana but many factors such as avoidance of conidia, the removal and burial of fungus-killed termites, together with defensive secretions and inhibitory components in termite frass  Rath 2000 , and grooming to remove spores  Milner and Glare, unpublished observations  reduce ﬁeld efﬁcacy. Boucias et al.  1996  used a low sublethal dose of a neurotoxin, imidacloropid to disrupt the grooming behaviour of termites, which then became highly susceptible to the fungus B. bassiana.  One proposal is to use more than one pathogen to increase the utility of entomopathogenic fungi. It is often common in the ﬁeld to ﬁnd more than one pathogen exerting inﬂuence on a pest, such as both a nucleopolyhedrovirus and the fungus Entomophaga maimaiga infecting gypsy moth  Malakar et al.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   1999 . The possibility of combining multiple species or strains in a single biopesticide to overcome limitations inherent in the single strain approach is intriguing. For example, Inglis et al.  1997  have investigated the use of both M. anisopliae and B. bassiana for control of locusts and grasshoppers, to overcome the temperature limitations of both species. There are potentially many methods whereby the efﬁcacy of biopesticides could be enhanced by combinations, such as those described earlier, but the economics of producing multiple pathogens for a single product are usually too limiting.  3 BIOACTIVES FROM  ENTOMOPATHOGENIC FUNGI  While the focus on the practical use of entomopathogenic fungi has been on biocontrol using whole organisms, either as inoculative or inundative agents  Eilenberg et al. 2001 , these fungi are known to produce a number of toxins and enzymes. Some of these extracellular metabolites have been studied with the aim of using them as bioactives against insect pests. This biotechnological approach to utilizing entomo- pathogenic fungi can be demonstrated by the discovery and formulation of spinosyns, insecticidal toxins produced by an actinomycete. From the discovery of strain of Saccaropolyspora spinosa in the Carribbean, Dow Agrow Sciences have successfully developed a number of “green chemistry” insecticide products, such as Successe and Naturalytee. It may be possible to utilize active components from entomopathogenic fungi in a similar or novel fashion.  a  It is not surprising that entomopathogenic fungi produce extracellular enzymes and toxins. These compounds are required to both assist penetration of the host cuticle and overcome other host defenses, while excluding competing microbes. Proteases produced by entomopathogenic fungi to degrade cuticle and assist entry into the host are similar to proteases used by insects to degrade their own cuticle during molting  Samuels and Paterson 1995 . A number of enzymes are known from entomopathogenic fungi, such as the proteases, in cuticular breakdown. These enzymes can be thought of as bioactives and there has been increasing interest in use of these enzymes in pest control. Screen and St Leger  2000  have reported on the occurrence of typsins and chymotrypsins in M. anisopliae. The novel chymotrypsin  CHY1  is similar to bacterial chymotrypsins. Because paralogous genes for the chymo- trypsins are not found in genome sequences for yeast, gram eubacteria, archaebacteria, and mitochondria they hypothesis that chy1 arose from horizontal gene transfer.  lipases, and chitinases that assist  Entomopathogenic fungi also produce insecticidal toxins. The early literature on toxins from entomopathogenic fungi was reviewed by Roberts  1981  and more recently by Strasser et al.  2000 . Several metabolites from entomopatho- genic Deuteromycetes are well known and described. For example, Beauveria spp. are known to produce beauvericin, a  depsipeptide metabolite which has shown toxicity to a number of invertebrates  Roberts 1981 . Not all Beauveria can produce beauvericin, but it has been isolated from Paecilomyces fumosoroseus mycelium. B. bassiana is also reported to produce beauverolides, isarolides, and bassiano- lides, all cyclotetradepsipetides. Metarhizium strains are also well known for producing toxic metabolites, the best described of these are the destruxins. These cyclodepsi- peptides are toxic to a number of insects, but susceptibility varies considerably, ranging up to 30 times between silkworm larvae and Galleria  Roberts 1981 . Hirsutellin A is produced by Hirsutella thompsonii and is not proteolytic, but was toxic to a range of insects  Mazet and Vey 1995 . Aspergillus species are occasionally insect pathogens and are known to produce many insecticidal metabolites. However, the occurrence of aﬂatoxin production in many Aspergillus that infect insects has restricted interest in this group, although it is by no means necessary that insecticidal strains produce aﬂatoxins in any appreciable amount  Roberts 1981 . Not all entomopathogenic fungi produce toxins in the disease process. toxins are suspected, but not conclusively demonstrated. Injection of culture ﬁltrates of some entomopathogenic Entomophthorales into Galleria sp. resulted in blackening similar to that found in fully infected larvae [e.g., Roberts  1981 ]. Some of the lower fungi, such as Coelomomyces and the Entomophthorales, may possess only weak toxins, if any at all. It is more likely they overcome hosts by utilizing the nutrients and invading vital tissue  Roberts 1981 .  In some cases,  Some entomogenous fungi produce antibiotics. As entomopathogenic fungi must compete for utilization of cadavers with numerous resident and environmental bacteria, it is not surprising that a number of antibiotics are produced by the various strains and species. Hirsutella and the allied genus Cordyceps also produce a number of metabolites that may be weak toxins or antibiotics. Krasnoff and Gupta  1994  described an antibiotic, phomalactone, from the H. thompsonii var. synnematosa that was also toxic to apple maggots, Rhagoletis pomonella  Dipt., Tephritidae . Phomalactone was  Beauveria, inhibitory to other entomopathogenic fungi Tolypocladium, and Metarhizium . Cordyceps-infected cater- pillars are a traditional medicine in parts of Asia. This may be partly based on the production by Cordyceps of a weak antibiotic, cordycepin. Zabra et al.  1996  reported that metabolites from Z. neoaphidis had antibacterial activity. In the future, bioactives from entomopathogenic fungi may have a role in pest insect control, either formulated as pesticides, or through transgenic expression. Direct toxicity may not be the only aim, as some toxins or metabolites have antifeedant type activities  e.g., http:  www.item.ba.cnr.it biopesti.htm .  4 MOLECULAR GENETICS OF  ENTOMOPATHOGENIC FUNGI  The use of molecular techniques to manipulate entomopatho- genic fungi to overcome some of the limitations discussed  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   earlier has been proposed for many years. In comparison with advances made in manipulation of viruses and bacteria, progress with the fungi has been slow, which is not surprising given the multigene nature of fungal insect diseases. Most progress has been made with the Deuteromycete muscardine fungi, B. bassiana and M. anisopliae.  4.1 Transformation Systems  Modiﬁcation of entomopathogenic fungi has long been contemplated, but rarely reported. A limited number of studies have reported successful insertion of foreign genes into entomopathogenic fungi. A precursor to manipulation of entomopathogenic fungi using molecular techniques has been the development of transformation systems. There are several aims of transforming entomopathogenic fungi. These techniques enable gene disruption methods to be applied, which can lead to greater understanding of the genetics of disease processes, or the ability to introduce DNA into fungi may allow the modiﬁcation of cell processes, potentially allowing improvements in the use of entomopathogenic fungi for insect control.  to  and  biolistic  delivery  The ﬁrst transformation of an entomopathogenic fungus was reported by Goettel et al.  1990 , where M. anisopliae was transformed to be benomyl tolerant using pBENA3, a plasmid containing the benA3 allele from Aspergillus nidulans. Since then, there have been other reports on transformation of the Dueteromycete entomopathogens using a variety of methods. St Leger et al.  1995  used eletroporation transform M. anisopliae with the plasmids  pNOM102 and pBENA3  containing the b-glucuronidase and benomyl resistance genes. The cotransformants showed normal growth rates and retained their pathogenicity to insects  Bombyx mori . Polyethylene glycol  PEG -mediated transformation of protoplasts is another method for transformation of entomopathogenic fungi, as used with the P. fumosoroseus and P. lilacinus  Inglis et al. 1992  using benomyl as the selective agent. More recently, a heterologous transformation system for B. bassiana and M. anisopliae was developed based on the use of the A. nidulans nitrate reductase gene  niaD   Sandhu et al. 2001 . The niaD stable mutants of B. bassiana and M. anisopliae were selected by treatment of protoplasts with ethane methane sulfonate  EMS  and regenerated on chlorate medium.  4.2 Strain Improvement Through Biotechnology  Improvements in strains of entomopathogenic fungi have been attempted through selection as well as molecular methods. Selection of fungal strains with altered acyclic sugar alcohol  polyol  and trehalose content of the conidia may improve the endogenous reserves to enhance viability and desiccation tolerance. Cultures of B. bassiana, M. anisopliae, and P. farinosus grown under different conditions to obtain  conidia with a modiﬁed polyol and trehalose content resulted in conidia with increased intracellular levels of glycerol and erythritol that germinated more quickly than unselected conidia and at lower water activity  Hallsworth and Magan 1995 . Conidia with increased trehalose germinated more slowly but stored for longer than unselected conidia. Another approach is to use genetic modiﬁcation to “improve” strains and overcome limitations. This type of approach is in its infancy for entomopathogenic fungi, but there have been some interesting studies indicating the utility of the process. Two of the more promising studies on the potential of biotechnology to improve entomopathogenic fungi were published by Couteaudier et al.  1996  and Vaiud et al.  1998 . They demonstrated that protoplast fusion between a strain of B. bassiana from Leptinotarsa decemlineata with an insecticidal toxin-producing strain of B. sulfurescens resulted in recovery of some di-auxotrophic mutants with enhanced activity  faster kill  against L. decemlineata and the caterpillar Ostrinia nubilalis. The stability of the virulence following passage through the insect – host and stability of molecular structure for two of the fusion products suggested that asexual genetic recombination by protoplast fusion may provide an attractive method for the genetic improvement of biocontrol efﬁciency in entomopathogenic fungi  Vaiud et al. 1998 .  The most studied genes in the entomopathogenic fungi are the protease genes of M. anisopliae, particularly the Pr1 gene. This was the ﬁrst protease gene from an entomopathogenic fungi implicated in disease and was isolated by St Leger et al.  1992 . Pr1 has sequence similarity to proteinase K, but was more effective than that enzyme at degrading cuticle. It is similar to the subtilisin subclass of serine endopeptidases. Modiﬁcation of pr1 gene expression in M. anisopliae resulted in melanisation and cessation of feeding 25 – 30 h earlier than wild-type disease in caterpillars  St Leger et al. 1996 . V. lecanii, B. bassiana, Tolypocladium niveum, and P. farinosus also produced Pr1-type enzymes during nutrient deprivation  St Leger et al. 1991 . Southern analysis demonstrated that genes with signiﬁcant homologies to Metarhizium pr1 were present in the entomopathogens A. ﬂavus and V. lecanii but not Z. radicans  St Leger et al. 1992 . More recently, 11 subtilisin proteases  Pr1s  were identiﬁed from one strain of M. anisopliae  St Leger et al. 2001 . Recently, intended ﬁeld release of a modiﬁed M. anisopliae strain was reported  St Leger 2001 . The strain has the pr1 cuticle degrading protease gene under control of a constitutive promoter. The gene overproduction did not alter the host range, but resulted in a strain with a reduced median lethal time to kill. It also reduced the ability of transformants to sporulation. The pr1 gene expression was under dual control of a general carbon catabolite repression depression mechanism and a carbon source induction mechanism to control expression. Overexpression of extracellular chitinase, an enzyme important in the cuticular penetration of insects by entomopathogenic fungi, has also been demonstrated for M. anisopliae var. anisopliae  Screen et al. 2001 . They expressed a chitinase gene from M. anisopliae var. acridium under control of an Aspergillus regulatory element to express  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

Genetic manipulation of entomopathogenic fungi has a long way to go before transgenic pest control strains become available, if such technology is ever acceptable to regulators and the community. However, strain modiﬁcation continues to provide a wealth of data on disease processes.  5 MOLECULAR IDENTIFICATION AND  TRACKING  In addition to improving our understanding of the genetics of disease caused by entomopathogenic fungi, molecular techniques have also been used to aid in identiﬁcation, classiﬁcation, and environmental monitoring of fungi. It is now almost a standard practice to perform some form of genetic characterization of fungi to speciﬁcally identify strains used for biocontrol purposes. The utility of molecular techniques, however, has been demonstrated beyond simple strain identiﬁcation. There are a number of reviews on the use of molecular characterization for entomogenous fungi in the literature [e.g., Driver et al.  1998  and Glare  2002 ]. An example of the importance of molecular characterization was the clariﬁcation of the taxonomic position of M. anisopliae strain IMI 330189 used in the LUBILOSA program for locust control. Often described as a M. ﬂavoviride strain because of the morphology of the conidia and some other features, the correct classiﬁcation was debated. Recently, Driver et al.  2000  published a revision of the subspeciﬁc relationships between M. anisopliae and M. ﬂavoviride strains, based largely on the sequence of the ITS-5.8s regions of rRNA. They demonstrated that IMI 330189 and related strains formed a discrete clade on the M. anisopliae branch of the Metarhizium trees, a ﬁnding that appears to have been well received by those working on locust control. Driver et al.  2000  named the subspecies M. anisopliae var. acridium, as well as describing several other subspecies, some of which can only presently be distinguished by ITS sequencing. This demonstrates a problem with molecular characterization, as fungal species cannot be solely erected on sequence data and requires supporting morphological or biological descriptions. Molecular markers have been used to characterize the genotypes of individual fungal strains by examining gene products, but new techniques allow direct examination of variability at the DNA level. Pulsed ﬁeld gel electrophoresis has been used to study karyotype variation in other fungi, and could be used with entomopathogens. Several studies have examined the number of chromosomes and mapped genes on those chromosomes. Viaud et al.  1996  studied the level of chromosome length polymorphism among nine isolates of B. bassiana to obtain a more extensive knowledge of the genomic organization. While extensive use of molecular characterization has proved useful, there are currently no standard techniques or agreement on even how many regions of the genome should be sampled to provide taxonomic data.  While this is not a problem for strain identiﬁcation or comparison, it reduces the ability to compare between studies. Many of the molecular studies on entomogenous fungi have used the nuclear ribosomal DNA, but there are a number of other DNA regions used, such as mitochondrial DNA  mtDNA  restriction fragment length polymorphisms. The MtDNA has been used to estimate intraspecies variation in V. lecanii and M. anisopliae isolates.  The contribution of molecular techniques to the develop- ment of entomopathogenic fungi has been enormous. The techniques have been used to clarify evolutionary relation- ships [e.g., Driver et al.  2000  and Jensen et al.  1998 ]. Molecular techniques have also allowed development of theories of evolution around these often obligate pathogens. Generally, studies on the entomogenous fungi using conserved mitochondrial or nuclear regions have failed to ﬁnd a link between fungal species and host species. For example, Bidochka et al.  2001  found that habitat rather than host selection drives population structure of M. anisopliae. There have been exceptions, such as B. bassiana strains from Sitona weevils  Maurer et al. 1997  and some Entomoph- thorales [e.g., Jensen and Eilenberg  2001 ]. In the order Entomophthorales, sequencing of the small subunit rDNA has been used to examine phylogenetic relationships  Jensen et al. 1998 . The molecular studies supported the use of spore discharge characteristics as an identifying characteristic for Entomophthorales. The role of horizontal gene transfer in microbial evolution has been the topic and studies by St Leger et al.  2001  have found some evidence for the involvement of horizontal gene transfer in evolution of fungal parasitism, ﬁnding similarity between genes in M. anisopliae and Streptomyces bacteria. Monitoring of speciﬁc strains of entomopathogenic fungi in the ﬁeld after release is crucial for advancing and understanding of biopesticide ecology. It has often been difﬁcult to conduct ecological studies on fungal persistence and spread after application, because there has been a lack of simple methods for isolation and speciﬁc strain characterization of these fungi. The molecular characteriz- ation of strains of entomogenous fungi has improved the ability to track speciﬁc fungi in the ﬁeld. Speciﬁc identiﬁcation of the B. brongniartii strain used for control of the scarab pest, Hoplochelus marginalis, in the ReUnion Islands was based on introns  insertions  in the 28s gene of the rDNA  Neuve´glise et al. 1997 . Genetic modiﬁcation is also a method to allow tracking following release of a strain into the environment or in a host. For example, a b-glucuronidase gene has been inserted in M. anisopliae to allow detection of hyphae in infected hosts  St Leger et al. 1995  and the expression of a green ﬂuorescent protein-encoding gene for tracking purposes  St Leger 2001 .  6 SAFETY OF ENTOMOPATHOGENIC  FUNGI  Biopesticides based on entomopathogenic fungi are now available, with a range of different species and strains used.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   The growing use of these insect pathogens has raised interest in the safety of microbial pesticides, above the level previously required for registration purposes. This increased scrutiny of environmental and mammalian safety of entomopathogenic fungi is part of a worldwide move to more awareness of potential negative impacts of bio- technology. Few of the entomopathogenic fungi are thought to pose a direct threat to human health. There are exceptions, such as the entomophthoralean fungus, Conidiobolus coronatus, but the potentially hazardous strains would be contemplated. Many products have required mammalian toxicology packages to be submitted during the registration process to demonstrate safety. Generally, the entomopathogenic Deuteromycetes are considered to have low risk of mammalian toxicity [e.g., Donovan-Peluso et al.  1980  and Shadduck et al.  1982 ]. Recent papers on Metarhizium and Beauveria have raised some issues regarding mammalian safety of immunocom- prised individuals  Burgner et al. 1998; Henke et al. 2002 .  is unlikely any development of  it  In addition to viewing bioactives from entomopathogenic fungi as potentially useful, there has been consideration of their effect as potential hazards in registering entomopatho- genic fungi. There are some results showing activity against human cell lines, such as tumor cell lines for P. tenuipes cytotoxic components  Nam et al. 2001 . Production of toxic secondary metabolites has caused problems in the registration of some fungi in Europe. Strasser et al.  2000  summarizes data on speciﬁc secondary metabolites  destruxins, efra- peptins, oosporein, beauvericin, and beauveriolides  produced by the genera Beauveria, Metarhizium, and Tolypocladium. They found that fungal bioactives posed no obvious risk to humans, although the number of detailed studies is limited. Some studies have indicated low-level activity against animals of selected bioactives such as destruxins of Metarhizium have an intraperitoneal injection the levels of LD50 of 1 – 16 mg kg in mice. However, metabolites produced during insect infection were much lower than in culture.  There is a growing body of research on nontarget impacts of fungal-based insecticides [e.g., Goettel et al.  2001  and Hokkanen and Hajek  2002 ], which have not found increased environmental risk from their use. The present evidence is that mycoinsecticides are very safe in production and use from both an environmental and mammalian toxicity viewpoint  Goettel et al. 2001 . However, the formulations being developed require stringent testing to ensure their superior safety compared with comparable chemical pesti- cides  Moore and Prior 1993 . While the fungi themselves have generally not been found to be a risk through testing and natural exposure, the development of novel formulations and strain combinations will require careful evaluation to ensure no unexpected effects occur. This could be especially true of nontarget impacts. Similarly, any development of genetically modiﬁed strains will have to be carefully studied for environmental and mammalian safety. Regulations in all countries are becoming more stringent on these issues, especially for genetically modiﬁed organisms.  7 CONCLUSIONS  Biotechnological approaches to the study and development of entomopathogenic fungi have advanced the ﬁeld in recent years. Improvements in formulations allowing new biopes- ticides to succeed in unexpected conditions  such as locust control in Africa , strain selection, and identiﬁcation have advanced not only biopesticide formulation, but under- standing of disease processes and ecology. More speciﬁc identiﬁcation systems have allowed better monitoring of biopesticide applications as well as development of phylogenetic classiﬁcation. Despite some success, commer- cial use of entomopathogenic fungi is restricted by high cost, inadequate or inconsistent efﬁcacy, limited mass production capability, and poor shelf life. However, entomopathogenic fungi have several advantages over other microbes for formulation in biopesticides as many species have a robust spore stage, capable of survival in products for many months or years. Some are easy to grow on simple media and can be formulated using a number of simple procedures. They can often kill more than one target pest, although limited in host range enough for registration purposes. With continuing improvements in formulation and application technology, it is likely that many more niche biopesticides will come to market, especially with the increased markets due to a rise in organic production and the reduction in the number of chemical pesticides available.  There are a number of new techniques and applications that will aid in the further development of entomopathogenic fungi. Application of molecular biological techniques to entomopathogenic fungi also holds the promise of strain improvement through genetic manipulation, or assist in strain improvement without genetic modiﬁcation. For example, through techniques such as protoplast fusion and chromosome exchange, using knowledge of desired chromosomal gene location, may enable superior strain qualities to be combined in single isolates. Determining the underlying genetics of host speciﬁcity, the toxins and enzymes involved in the disease process, and genetics of fungal processes such as sporulation and germination are all under study around the world. Advances in these areas may allow greater use to be made of entomopathogenic fungi.  The potential of entomopathogenic fungi lies not just in their application as biopesticides based on the live fungus, but also in the isolation and development of bioactives from these fungi. Toxins, enzymes, and antibiotics are all produced by entomopathogenic fungi and, as techniques for their isolation and expression increase, for exploiting bioactives is enhanced. In some cases these bioactives are not toxins, but may exert other useful effects, such as antifeeding activity. There is also potential in novel strategies for biopesticide use such as mixtures of behaviour-modifying chemicals for enhancing control of social insects with pathogens.  the potential  While the history of biopesticide development  from entomopathogenic fungi is littered with more failures than  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

As the knowledge from several commercially successful products and new technol- ogies are applied to biopesticide development, we can expect to see more novel biocontrol methods applied to insect pests in the future using fungal species.

Mehta Dr. H.S. Gour University, Saugor, India, and Institute of Microbiology, Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic  1  INTRODUCTION  recorded from outside this genus  Flieger et al. 1997; Kozlovsky 1999 .  Ergot alkaloids belong to the group of compounds produced by fungi, which are referred to as secondary metabolites. They are produced by a number of fungi mainly of Claviceps spp. but they have been also found in other fungi and higher plants. Ergot  sclerotium of the pyrenomycete Claviceps purpurea  develops in ﬂorets of grasses and sedges. In early days, the medieval midwives used to collect the fungus from naturally infected plants and used it in the induction of childbirth and in the control of postpartum bleeding. The role of ergot has undergone important changes from a dreaded toxic parasite to an important source of biologically effective substances. C. purpurea is, apart from yeast, the ﬁrst fungus, which was biotechnologically exploited without its existence known. The beginning of modern ergot research dates back to the extraction of the ﬁrst alkaloid mixture from sclerotia in 1875, isolation of ergotoxine  mixture of ergocornine, ergocristine, and ergokryptine  in 1907, and the discovery of the ﬁrst clinically used compound, ergotamine in 1918. At the beginning of ﬁfties the chemistry, biosynthesis, physiology, biochemistry, genetics, biotechnology, and therapeutical applications of ergot alkaloids have been extensively studied  Berde and Sturmer 1978; Mukherjee and Menge 2000; Rehacek and Mehta 1993; Tudzynski et al. 2001 . The present review gives an overview of biotechno- logical potential of ergot alkaloids with a perspective for the future.  2 SOURCES  In nature, the ergot alkaloids are formed primarily by various species of Claviceps. However, ergot alkaloids have also been  Ascomycetes Eurotiales: Aspergillus fumigatus, A. ﬂavus, A. japonicus, tamarii, A. versicolor, A. nidulans, A. oryzae; A. camembertii, Penicillium aurantiovirens, P. chermesinum, P. fumigatus, P. clavigerum, P. concavorugulosum, P. crustosum, P. griseofulvum, P. kapuscinskii, P. palitans, P. patulum, P. roqueforti, P. rubrum, P. rugulosum, P. sizovae, P. viridicatum  P.

The common part of chemical structure of the most ergot alkaloids is a tetra- cyclic ergoline ring system  Figure 1 , which is biosynthe- sized from tryptophan  Taber and Vining 1959 , and mevalonic acid  Groger et al. 1961 . The ergot alkaloids  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   natural substances having the unique structure called cyclol  Figure 4  that consists of three aminoacids. The ergopeptines are further divided to  a  ergotamine,  b  ergoxine,  c  ergotoxine, and  d  b-ergoannine group  Flieger et al. 1997 .  4 BIOGENESIS  Ergot alkaloids are derived from tryptophan, mevalonic acid, and methionine  Birch et al. 1960; Groger et al. 1960; Taylor and Ramsted 1960 . The origin of the ergoline part from tryptophan and dimethylallylpyrophosphate was established at an enzymic level. The cell free biosynthesis of chanoclavines-I and II, agroclavine, and elymoclavine from precursors has been reported by Sajdl and Rehacek  1975  and Cavender and Anderson  1970 . Tryptophan has also been found to be a factor in the induction and depression of enzymes catalyzing alkaloid formation  Krupinski et al. 1976 . The ﬁrst enzyme of alkaloid biosynthesis is dimethylallyltryptophan synthase  DMATS   Heinstein et al. 1971  and the encoding gene was cloned from C. fusiformis and C. purpurea  Tsai et al. 1995; Tudzynski et al. 1999 . Recent data of Tudzynski et al. in C. purpurea, all genes involved in alkaloid biosynthesis are organized in a cluster and are regulated by phosphate and pH level. This ﬁnding veriﬁed the previously published data on the negative role of phosphate in the induction of enzymes catalyzing the alkaloid synthesis  Krupinski et al. 1976  and on inhibition of alkaloid synthesis by high concentration of phosphate in the culture medium  Mehta 1984; Pazoutova et al. 1983 . Gene for peptide synthetase homologous to that of C. purpurea was also detected in Epichloe and Neotyphodium species  Annis and Panaccione 1998; Panaccione et al. 2001 .   2001  show that  Ergot alkaloid synthesis requires changes in differen- tiation. In C. purpurea the formation of conidia is inversely dependent on the synthesis of alkaloids for those saprophytic strains, which partially retain parasitic development, i.e., differentiation of the sphacelial phase to the conidial or the  Figure 1 Structure of ergoline.  can be separated into three main structural groups:  a  clavine alkaloids,  b  simple lysergic and paspalic acid derivatives, and  c  peptide alkaloids  ergopeptines . The clavine alkaloids are tricyclic  secoergolines  or tetracyclic  ergo- lines  compounds usually substituted with methyl, hydroxyl or hydroxymethyl group in position C-8 and in many cases have a double bond in positions 8,9  D8,9-ergolenes  or 9,10  D9,10-ergolenes  of the ergoline skeleton  Figure 2 . The important feature of all D9,10-ergolenes  including simple derivatives of lysergic acid and ergopeptines  is an easy isomerization on C 8  resulting in formation of two isomers. Clavine alkaloids represent the largest group of ergot alkaloids due to the action of various enzymes, which direct agroclavine and or elymoclavine from the main biosynthetic route agroclavine – elymoclavine – paspalic acid – lysergic acid. Such type of shunt activity is particularly evident in microorganisms that lack the complete pathway and are unable to synthesize substituted lysergic acid  Vining 1980 . The simple derivatives of paspalic and lysergic acid  Figure 3  are mostly amides, in which the amide part is either small peptide or a simple alkylamide. Amides of lysergic and paspalic acids found in ergot are ergometrine, lysergic acid 2-hydroxyethylamide, lysergic acid amide  ergine , paspalic acid, and 10-hydroxy-paspalamide  Flieger et al. 1993 . Ergopeptines are derivatives of lysergic acid and are the only  Figure 2 General structure of secoergolenes  1 , D8,9-ergolenes  2 , and D9,10-ergolenes  3 .  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

In strains with not clearly separated conidial phase, vegetative growth, and the alkaloid phase, the conidia formation occurs simultaneously with alkaloid synthesis. The morphological development of the mycelium in submerged Claviceps cultures shows signiﬁcant differences between high-yielding and degener- ated cultures  Flieger et al. 1982 . The character of fat hyphae and sclerotia-like cells of submerged mycelium is reminiscent of the plectenchymatic structure of parasitic cultures and have been found to inﬂuence the alkaloid production in C. fusiformis  Dickerson et al. 1970 .  Cultivation conditions convenient for primary metabolism are not suitable for high alkaloid production  Taber and Vining 1963 . To obtain overproduction of alkaloids, high citrate or Krebs cycle intermediate level in the medium is required  Pazoutova et al. 1981 . The inability of submerged Claviceps cultures to grow on hexoses in absence of Krebs cycle intermediates comes from the parasitic way of life where the level of citrate and malate in the host plant phloem sap is high. The rate of oxidative metabolism of saccharides and the activity of alkaloid synthesis were proved to be proportional  Pazoutova et al. 1981 . Another important fact is that clavine alkaloids are extracellular products with high solubility in the culture medium and feedbacks regulate their own biosynthesis  Flieger et al. 1988 . Ergopeptines are mostly intracellular and are accumulated in lipid droplets  oleosomes  with no inﬂuence on the metabolism  Neumann et al. 1979 .  5  INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION  5.1  Industrial Production of Ergot Alkaloids  The overall word annual production of ergot alkaloids was estimated at about 20,000 kg  Cvak 1999  in which the production of ergopeptines and their dihydroderivatives forms less then one third. The rest of the production is  concentrated on production of lysergic acid and other precursors of semisynthetic ergot preparations  lysergol, elymoclavine, ergine, and other simple derivatives of lysergic acid . In the last decade the production of ergopeptines  Table 1  remained conﬁned due to their limited therapeutic use while the production of semisynthetic ergot preparations is gaining importance due to the development of new drugs with new and more speciﬁc therapeutical applications  Berde and Sturmer 1978; Eich and Pertz 1999; Pertz and Eich 1999 . It is evident from the data  Table 1  that lysergic acid is the main precursor of semisynthetic ergot preparations, which can be obtained by chemical decomposition of ergopeptines or simple derivatives of lysergic acid. So far, very limited amount of ergot preparations have been synthesized from clavine alkaloids. Field production of ergot alkaloids is still an important source of ergopeptines. In the last decades, the major effort was devoted to selection of strains producing deﬁned spectrum of alkaloids. Recently, the average yield of ergot reached the level of 1000 kg ha with content of alkaloids above 1%  Cvak 1999 .  5.2 Saprophytic Cultivation of Claviceps  5.2.1 History  The ﬁrst saprophytic cultivation of Claviceps on artiﬁcial nutritional media dates back to 1922  Bonns 1922 . The ﬁrst attempt for the industrial production of ergot alkaloids was isolation of clavine alkaloids from submerged cultures of different Claviceps spp.  Abe and Yamatodani 1954; 1955; Abe et al. 1952; 1956 . Later, conditions for saprophytic production of simple derivatives of lysergic acid were developed using different strains of C. paspali  Arcamone et al. 1960; 1961 . It took only 5 years more when new isolate of C. purpurea was found to produce ergotamine under submerged conditions  Amici et al. 1966 . Since that time all types of ergot alkaloids for direct use as therapeutic agents or precursors for the preparation of semisynthetic drugs can be obtained by fermentation.

There are three main processes used for the preparation of Claviceps strains for saprophytic culture.  a  Plating of plectenchymatic tissue from the surface sterilized sclerotia on an agar growth medium  Mantle 1969 ,  b  Plating of honeydew drops containing conidia formed at early stage of Claviceps infection  Janardhanan and Husain 1984; Pazoutova et al. 2002 , and  c  Trapping of sexual ascospores ejected from fruiting bodies on germinated sclerotia. By this method monosporic culture can be obtained  Vasarhelyi et al. 1980 .  5.2.3 Strain Improvement  The classical methods  selection pressure, mutagenesis, and recombination  used for the strain improvement are, to some extent, more complicated with Claviceps due to incomplete information on cell nucleus. Strains used for saprophytic cultivation might be heterokaryotic and homokaryotic  Didek-Brumec et al. 1991; Mantle and Nisbet 1976 . Recently it was found that the number of chromosomes in C. purpurea is variable so that haploid as well as aneuploid nuclei may be encountered  Hu¨sgen et al. 1999 . Mutagenesis followed by subsequent selection of strain is an important technique in increasing the yield of alkaloids  Didek-Brumec et al. 1987 . An ergocristine producing C. purpurea strain showed 180-fold increase in alkaloid production after eight- step mutation-selection with different mutagens  Kobel and Sanglier 1978 . Mutagenesis of sporulating strain results in monosporic isolates. To increase the mutation frequency the protoplasts prepared from spores of selected strains were used  Olasz et al. 1982; Zalai et al. 1990 . More complicated situation is with mutagenesis of asporogenic strains. Hyphal fragments are rather unsuitable for mutagenesis due to the higher number of nuclei. Even protoplast formation from young mycelium and subsequent regeneration without any mutagenic treatment yielded strains with different properties  Schumann et al. 1987 . Protoplast fusion technique is beginning to ﬁnd useful applications either in producing improved mutant strains by intraspeciﬁc crosses or in formation of novel spectrum of products by interspeciﬁc hybrids  Socic and Gaberc-Porekar 1992 . Relevant structural and regulatory genes of the alkaloid biosynthesis in C. purpurea form a cluster of about 50 kbp in length  Tudzynski et al. 2001 , therefore, isolation and cloning of the entire pathway to more rapidly growing fungus would be difﬁcult.  5.2.4 Maintenance Improvement and Long-Term  Preservation  Degeneration, loss of production capabilities, is a general problem of high-yielding strains of Claviceps  Kobel 1969 . Conservation and systematically performed selection of the  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   isolates is the only way to eliminate the biological effects given by the transfer of cultures, ageing, and other inﬂuences. Methods applied for long-term preservation were recently reviewed  Hunter-Cervera and Belt 1996 . For preservation of sporulating cultures two main methods are applied: deep- freezing and maintaining of cultures on rye grains or agar slants placed in refrigerator. Nonsporulating strains due to higher sensitivity to conservation procedure are frequently preserved as cultures on the agar plates. The universal technique applied for preservation is keeping of lyophilized cultures and cultures frozen, in liquid nitrogen  Baumert et al. 1979 .  5.3 Fermentation  toxins, etc. ,  All technologies developed for industrial scale have the same aims: maximal production of desired ergot alkaloids, minimum amount of accompanying contaminants  other alkaloids, the shortest possible time of fermentation, minimized cost of medium, energy, equip- ments, and labor. For the production of ergot alkaloids, different fermentation technologies have been employed  a  stationary cultivation on liquid or solid medium  Kybal and Vlcek 1976; Trejo-Hernandez and Lonsane 1993 ,  b  submerged cultivations  Kobel and Sanglier 1986  also adapted to semicontinuous or continuous processes  Kopp and Rehm 1984 . In some cases the immobilized microor- ganisms were used for production of ergot alkaloids under condition of submerged fermentation  Komel et al. 1985; Kopp and Rehm 1983; Kren 1991 .  5.3.1 Stationary Surface Cultivation  In the beginning of sixties, the development of processes for production of ergot alkaloids under conditions of stationary cultivation on liquid media started  Adams 1962; Kybal et al. 1960; Molnar et al. 1964; Rochelmeyer 1965 . The stationary surface cultivation on agar slants was commonly used for preparation of starting cultures. When transformed to industrial scale this technology showed some limitations mostly due to difﬁculties with control of aseptic conditions of large surfaces. Vlcek and Kybal  1974  developed technology for stationary cultivation of C. purpurea in plastic bags partially ﬁlled with inoculated liquid medium. This procedure was used for production of ergotoxins and later adapted to production of asexual spores of C. purpurea for ﬁeld production.  5.3.2 Submerged Cultivation  i.e., shaker Submerged fermentation in laboratory scale, cultivation, is a primary step in getting knowledge of production microorganism physiology, biosynthesis, sporula- tion, stability, and inﬂuence of medium composition on production of alkaloids. In industrial scale, submerged fermentation in shaker culture is mostly used for preparation  of sufﬁcient amount of inoculum for further cultivation step. During the inoculum preparation, an optimal state of the culture for biosynthesis of ergot alkaloids in the production step can be established  Socic et al. 1985; 1986 . Usually, the whole industrial process consist of four steps i.e.,  a  shaker culture,  b  preinoculating fermentation,  c  seed fermenta- tion, and  d  production fermentation followed by down- stream processing  Malinka 1999 . Industrial production of clavine alkaloids, agroclavine, and elymoclavine by sub- merged fermentation of different strains of Claviceps sp. was reported in a number of patents  Kren et al. 1988; Rehacek et al. 1986; Trinn et al. 1990 , reaching the maximum production of alkaloidal mixture about 6 g l  Pazoutova and Tudzynski 1999; Pazoutova et al. 1987 . In contrast to high production and well elaborated procedure of submerged cultivation the industrial production of clavine alkaloids does not receive much attention due to limited amount of procedures leading to preparation of desirable ﬁnal products  cf. Table 1 . Production of lysergic acid and its simple derivatives is of high technological and industrial interest due to relatively simple procedure of chemical modiﬁcations to semisynthetic ergot preparations. The main producers of these alkaloids are strains of C. paspali. The basic studies on biosynthesis, physiology, and production of simple deriva- tives of lysergic acid were done on relatively limited number of strains including C. paspali 31  Rosazza et al. 1967 , C. paspali ATTC 13892  Socic et al. 1986 , and C. paspali MG-6  Bumbova-Linhartova et al. 1991 . The concentration of produced alkaloids reached nearly 3 g l of fermentation broth  Pertot et al. 1990  with the strain C. paspali L-52. One of the very interesting features of C. paspali strains is their ability to convert clavine alkaloids added to the cultivation medium to the simple derivatives of lysergic acid  Mothes et al. 1962 . Flieger et al.  1989a, b  and Harazim and Malinka  1989  used this capability of C. paspali CCM 8061 and developed technology of aggressive bioconversion of clavine alkaloids to simple derivatives of lysergic acid with total production of nearly 6 g l in batch cultivation and about 3 g l in industrial fermentor.  Different strains of C. purpurea, as the only producers of ergopeptines, were described for their submerged production. Ergotamine producing strains and their cultivation are the best-studied processes due to direct therapeutical use of ergotamine. Industrial technologies were developed for the following strains:  a  F.I. 32 17 producing 2 g l of ergotamine and a-ergokryptine mixture  Amici et al. 1966 ,  b  IBP 47, IMET PA135 producing 1.5 g l [mixture of alkaloids containing 75% of ergotamine  Baumert et al. 1979 ],  c  L-4  ATTC 20103  producing 1.5 g l of ergotamine  Komel et al. 1985 . Another type of ergopeptines produced by submerged cultivation belongs to group of ergotoxines, i.e., ergocristine, ergocornine, and a-ergokryptine. Between many published procedures and industrial technologies  Malinka 1999  the process developed for strain C. purpurea L-17 resulted in relatively high production of ergotoxines  2.4 g l . This strain was further studied and intermediary metabolism  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   and production of secondary metabolites were correlated  Gaberc-Porekar et al. 1992 .  modiﬁed ergopeptines was described by Bianchi et al.  1982  and Crespi-Perellino et al.  1992 .  5.3.3 Solid Substrate Fermentation  Robinson et al.  2001  has recently proposed solid substrate fermentation  SSF  for the production of enzymes and secondary metabolites. The production of ergot alkaloids by C. fusiformis using SSF procedure was found to be 3.9 times higher than that obtained by submerged liquid fermentations  SLF   Hernandez et al. 1993 . One of the reasons could be the necessity of use of antifoam chemicals and the shear stresses caused by stirring in SLF. Also, better air circulation can be achieved in SSF thus further increasing the ergot alkaloid yields  Balakrishnan and Pandey 1996 . The SSF has been shown to produce a more stable, requiring less energy in smaller fermentors with easier downstream processing measures. Also, by removal, the cost and trouble associated with antifoaming chemicals and by maximizing yield production, SSF may be seen as a viable option for industrial scale production of ergot alkaloids.  5.4 Optimization, Control, and Modeling of  Ergot Alkaloids Fermentation  The following facts should be taken into account for optimization and scale-up of fermentation processes for the production of ergot alkaloids  Kobel and Sanglier 1978 ,  a  the production strains should be continually tested to maintain the optimal quality of selected production strain and thus maximally eliminate the biological effects given by transfer of cultures, ageing, and other external inﬂuences,  b  long cultivation period in absence of antibiotics require very high standard of sterility in operation and equipment,  c  balanced aeration and stirring are required due to the sensitivity of the Claviceps cultures to the stress and high oxygen tension, and  d  the use of antifoam agents could cause considerable loss in alkaloid yield. Recently the application of oxygen vectors to C. purpurea cultivation was published  Menge et al. 2001 . The classical problem of the large-scale fermentations is an optimal supply of oxygen to growing Claviceps sp. High oxygen demand in the exponential growth phase can be met by addition of different hydrocarbons  Gilmanov et al. 1996  or perﬂuorocarbons  Menge et al. 2001  to shake ﬂask and or stirred reactors. Perﬂuorocarbons were successfully applied also in cultivations of other microorganisms  Lowe et al. 1998 . Besides these technological aspects, other techniques to optimize the fermentation process were described. The inﬂuence of nutrients, addition of ergot alkaloid precursors, mainly tryptophan and its derivatives, were described in many studies  Erge et al. 1984; Floss 1976 . As a result of feeding, prolonged idiophase of the fermentation process was found  Milicic et al. 1987  and this process seems to be one of the perspectives in modern alkaloid production  Socic and Gaberc-Porekar 1992 . Precursor controlled production of  The growth of the fungus and alkaloid formation in submerged batch fermentation was described by mathemat- ical model, which can be further used in automatic process control and optimization. Grm et al.  1980  proposed for C. purpurea growth model based on morphological features of a cell population during the fermentation process. Votruba and Pazoutova  1981  proposed another model accentuating the antagonistic effects of phosphate on growth and alkaloid production. A mathematical simulation of different techno- logical alternatives of clavine alkaloid production was done on this basis  Pazoutova et al. 1981 . The activation – inhibition kinetics of clavine alkaloids production was evaluated for two C. fusiformis strains  Flieger et al. 1988  and it was found that feed-back inhibition can be eliminated by combination of fermentation and separation units in a closed loop. Increased efﬁciency  more than 100%  of the fermentation process was also found when inducers of cytochrome P-450 were used  Rylko et al. 1988 .  6 CONCLUSIONS  The biotechnological relevance of ergot alkaloids is due to their therapeutical use, unquestionable. On the other hand, they play very important role as toxins in agricultural industry as products of endophytic fungi of the genus Neotyphodium and their production is coupled with serious problems of livestock grazing infected grasses. These two examples show the importance of molecular genetics of alkaloid biosynthesis. It could help, on one side, to develop new strategies for rational designing of ergot alkaloid based drugs, and, on the other one, to understand and control the production of ergot alkaloids by endophytic fungi. The following points need more attention for modern production of ergot alkaloids and its semisynthetic derivatives:  a  shortening of the initial nonproductive phase of alkaloid fermentation,  b  immobil- ization of cells,  c  construction of plasmids which can carry selectable markers,  d  the development of transformation systems with drug resistance markers,  e  study of membrane processes and vacuoles in the productive organism,  f  use of mathematical modeling for description of phenomenon observed during culture growth and alkaloid production, and  g  further development of solid state fermentation and application of oxygen vectors.

Kubota Gifu University, Yanagido Gifu, Japan  1  INTRODUCTION  the use of  in association with plant  Reduction of fertilizers and fungicides in agricultural production is necessary to help maintain ecosystems and to develop sustainable agriculture. The use of both bio-fertilizers and biocontrol systems can have minimal affect on the environment and such strategies have been widely researched. In soils, numerous microorganisms co-exist roots. Some micro- organisms live speciﬁcally in rhizosphere or on plant root surfaces, and these can have many effects on performance of the plant and may also affect the structure of the plant community. A unique microﬂora is particularly present around the plant root surface, where various substances are secreted. Most of the microorganisms distributed around plant root surface have a role in the decomposition of organic matter and some may suppress deleterious microorganisms, which could inhibit plant growth. Some of the root-associated microorganisms can promote plant growth, and they have been called “plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria”  PGPR; Kloepper et al. 1980  or “plant growth-promoting fungi”  PGPF; Hyakumachi 1994 . The PGPR and PGPF are known to suppress some plant diseases. Similar effects are also observed in plants treated with mycorrhizal fungi, which have a symbiotic relationship with most plant species. Endophytes can also promote plant growth and these have recently been considered as potential biological control agents. In this chapter, fungi as known as PGPF, mycorrhizal fungi, and endophytic fungi, which act as plant growth promoters and disease suppressors are considered.  2 FUNGI AS PLANT GROWTH PROMOTER  2.1 PGPF  Many fungi isolated from soil can inhibit plant growth. Generally, the inhibition of plant growth is mostly caused by  plant-pathogenic fungi, however, some fungi that are not normally considered as pathogens can also inhibit plant growth. These fungi have been termed indeﬁnite pathogenic fungi, and in one study, isolates of Eupenicillium javanicum, Penicillium janthinellim, P. citreonigrum, and P. citrinum obtained from roots of zinnia plant caused a 23 – 57% inhibition of the growth of the same plant  Yuen and Schroth 1986 . Gamliel and Katan  1991  reported that almost all the fungi isolated from the rhizosphere and roots of tomato inhibited the growth of the plant. In contrast other soil-borne fungi, such as Trichoderma sp., Rhizoctonia solani, and others, can promote signiﬁcant plant growth. Most of these PGPF have a high rhizosphere competence as a character. Because the genera found to be PGPF are common soil-borne fungi, there is a possibility that fungi having a similar role of PGPF exist widely in natural ecosystems. Some examples of plant growth promotion by PGPF are shown in Table 1. Most of these studies were quantiﬁed from the relative dry weights of root or above-ground part of treated plant seedlings with PGPF compared to nontreated ones over periods as short as 4 weeks. In some cases, signiﬁcant growth promoting effects of PGPF were observed as increased yield of plants grown in ﬁelds over longer periods of 14 weeks or more  Shivanna et al. 1994 .  2.1.1 PGPF in Trichoderma  Isolates of Trichoderma harzianum and T. koningii have been shown to enhance seedling emergence in tomato with increased shoot and root dry weights when compared to nontreated control plants  Table 1   Windham et al. 1986 . These species also gave rise to increased shoot and root dry weights in tobacco  Table 1   Windham et al. 1986 . Isolates of T. viride have been reported to increase tomato plant height  Windham et al. 1986 . Chang et al.  1986  have shown that isolates of T. harziamum enhanced seedling emergence in chilli pepper and promoted growth of tomato, chilli pepper,  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

Isolates of T. harziamum have also been used to enhance ﬂowering of periwinkle and to increase the number of ﬂowers per plant in chrysanthemum.  2.1.2 PGPF in Mycelial Fungi  fungi  Plant growth promotion has been obtained from isolates of mycelial that do not produce any spores. These unidentiﬁed fungi have been termed sterile black fungus  SBF , sterile dark fungus  SDF , and sterile red fungus  SRF , and have been isolated from corn roots, wheat roots, and wheat and rye grass roots, respectively. Unidentiﬁed isolates considered to be SBF  Speakman and Kruger 1984  and SDF  Narita and Suzuki 1991  were shown to increase shoot dry weight in wheat and similarly isolates termed to SRF increased shoot wet weight in wheat  Dewan and Sivasithamparam 1989 . Growth promotion by these unidentiﬁed fungi has been reported in other plants and isolates of SBF have been reported to increase shoot dry weight in barley  Speakman and Kruger 1984 . Fungi considered as SRF have been reported to promote plant growth of rye, brome grass, chick pea, lupine, medic, pea, ryegrass, and clover, all of which are used as typical rotation crops with wheat, and resulted in an increased shoot fresh weight  Dewan and Sivasithamparam 1989 . The mycelial isolates used in these studies have not been identiﬁed, although isolates of SRF are thought to be Basidiomycetes because of the presence of clamp connection. Strains of SBF and SDF are easily isolated from herbal plants as well as woody plants and their relationships to endophytic fungi are being currently considered.  2.1.3 PGPF in Rhizoctonia  A particular nonpathogenic strain of R. solani has shown growth promotion and signiﬁcantly increased yield for various crops in ﬁeld experiments  Sneh et al. 1986 . These included increased wet and dry weights of radish roots and carrot roots, and increased weights of cotton ﬁber and wheat grains. In similar experiments with potato, although increases were observed in shoot and tuber weight until 63 – 70 days after transplanting, there was no increase in yield at the time of harvest. Some isolates of binucleate Rhizoctonia have been found to be PGPF  Harris et al. 1993; Villajuan-Abgona et al. 1996 .  2.1.4 Other PGPF  Isolates of Rhizopus nigricans and Fusarium roseum have been reported to increase shoot dry weight in tomato  Lindsey and Baker 1967 . Soil conditions such as pH, water, nutrient and organic content, together with the presence of other micro-organisms are important considerations for the introduction of beneﬁcial micro-organisms into soil. Hyaku- machi  1994  reported the plant growth promotion effect of PGPF occurred in sterilized or nonsterilized nutrient-deﬁcient and rich soils, potting soil, and most conspicuously in the  nutrient-deﬁcient one. The effect of PGPF was also observed in soil that had been converted to nutrient-rich by amendment with NPK fertilizer.  The duration of the plant-growth promoting effect of PGPF in the treated plants is an important factor for the earlier application. Increased growth responses were observed in wheat treated with PGPF isolates during the seedling stage  2 weeks after sowing , vegetative stage  4 weeks , pre- ﬂowering stage  10 weeks , and seed maturation stage  14 weeks   Hyakumachi 1994; Shivanna et al. 1994 . All of the isolates used increased plant height, and also signiﬁcantly increased the ear-head length, weight, seed number, and biomass  Table 1   Shivanna et al. 1994 .  In order to develop applications, it is important to isolate PGPF strains that  a  have high afﬁnity for plants and can colonize their rhizosphere,  b  show high levels of plant growth promotion, and  c  offer consistent performance in ﬁeld trials. Although an isolate with a wide host range is an ideal candidate, there is a requirement for isolates that show high speciﬁc effectiveness with an individual host plant.  2.2 Mechanisms of Plant Growth Promotion by  PGPF  Several hypotheses have been put forward for the mechanisms of plant growth promotion by PGPF, including  a  hormone production,  b  substrate degradation  mineralization , and  c  suppression of deleterious microorganisms.  2.2.1 Hormone Production  Culture ﬁltrates of certain fungal species promote plant growth, due to the production of plant growth hormones by these fungi  Ram 1959 . Growth promotion has been seen in some plants after treatment with mycelial exudates from PGPF strains of Trichoderma and SRF, and a gibberellin-like substance was reported to be involved  Gillespie-Sasse et al. 1991; Windham et al. 1986 . Some strains of Phoma species have been found to produce abscisic acid, and this compound is also reported to promote plant growth. However, in general terms, these appear to have little relationship between the production of plant growth hormones and the ability of PGPF to promote plant growth.  2.2.2 Mineralization  Close relationships have been shown between the reduction of barley grain weight due to PGPF, the subsequent growth promotion effect of PGPF, and their cellulase and starch degration activity  Hyakumachi 2000 . Production of NH4-N and NO3-N in soil can also be increased by amendment with PGPF-infested barley grains.  The total amount of nitrogen in PGPF infected-barley grains remains the same despite which PGPF isolate is used, however, the amount of NH4-N varies depending on the isolate, with the highest level being seen in grains infected  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   with Phoma. The NH4-N levels later decreased in the order Phoma . Fusarium . Penicillium . Trichoderma . control: The amount of NH4-N was about 7.8 times higher in Phoma infested-barley grains than that of control  Hyakumachi 2000 . Hyakumachi  2000  also demonstrated correlations between reduction of barley grain weight and cellulase activity, starch degradation activity of starch, and the dry weight of bentgrass. These results suggest that the mineralization of organic substrates by PGPF relates to the plant-growth promoting effect of those PGPF. The PGPF may therefore provide the plant with necessary mineral nutrients in an easily assimilating form.  2.2.3 Suppression of Deleterious Microorganisms  A remarkable plant growth promotion effect has been reported for ﬁeld-grown cucumbers, and this was attributed to the suppression of indigenous pathogenic Pythium spp. in the soil by PGPF  Hyakumachi 1994 . The suppression of deleterious microorganisms by PGPF may therefore be one of the mechanisms of plant-growth promotion.  2.3 Mycorrhiza  As a deﬁnition of mycorrhizae, Smith and Read  1997  proposed “a symbiosis in which an external mycelium of a fungus supplies soil derived nutrients to a plant root.” Mycorrhizae are further divided into six types based on anatomical characteristics, which are:  a  arbuscular mycor- rhizae  AM ,  b  ectomycorrhizae,  c  orchid mycorrhizae,  d  ericoid mycorrhizae,  e  monotropoid mycorrhizae, and  f  arbutoid mycorrhizae. Some plants have requirement for mycorrhizae in order to complete their life cycle. Mycor- rhizae may inﬂuence host plant survival in regeneration niches and mycorrhizae can also increase seed production, seed quality, and host and offspring vigor. Some types of mycorrhizae enhance host plant resistance against severe environmental conditions. The most widely studied and most-commonly encountered mycorrhizal systems are the ectomycorrhizae and arbuscular mycorrhizae.  2.3.1 Ectomycorrhizae  About 5000 fungi, Asco- and Basidiomycetes, are known to form ectomycorrhizal association with about 2000 species of woody plants  Kendrick and Berch 1985 . Roughly 5% of the vascular plants are known to develop ectomycorrhizae and these associations are typically seen by the intercellular development of Hartig nets. Ectomycorrhizal fungi are known to enhance the uptake of water and nutrients by the host plant, and to promote plant growth. Growth effects have been observed in a broad range of forest trees, such as Douglas ﬁr, pine, and eucalyptus, with ectomycorrhiza associations forming in nurseries and in the ﬁeld. Laccaria laccota, Pisolithus tinctorius, Suillus plorans, Hebeloma cylindro- sporum, and H. crustuliniforme have been used as soil  inoculations and their growth promoting performances were dependent on the host plant. Large increases in the growth of pines have been recorded in ﬁeld experiments. For instance, 25 – 100% increases in growth have been reported for three pine species inoculated with Pisolithus tinctorius on ﬁve reforestration sites in the southern United States  Marx et al. Inoculation with Paxillus involutus has been 1977 . associated with a marked increase in stem diameter and volume, especially with sessile oak at Bouxie`res where the volume almost doubled over 7 years  Garbaye and Churin 1997 .  The increase in growth resulting from inoculation with mycorrhizal fungi has been attributed to improved nutrition of the host plant in most cases. Ectomycorrhizal fungi are able to absorb and accumulate phosphorus, nitrogen, potassium, and calcium in the fungal mantles more rapidly and for longer periods of time than nonmycorrhizal feeder roots. Ecto- mycorrhizal fungi improve the efﬁciency of phosphorus uptake principally through the development of extramatrical hyphae, which increase the absorptive surface and effective rooting density of the plant. Ectomycorrhiza are likely to enhance N uptake where the fungus and host plant differ in their capacity to absorb and assimilate NO3-N. Mycorrhizal fungi generally have a preference for NH4-N, although a number of species can also utilize NO3-N  Plassard et al. 1991 .  2.3.2 Arbuscular Mycorrhiza  Arbuscular mycorrhizal  AM  associations are due to Glomales, an order of Zygomycetes  Morton and Benny 1990 . The order consists of 7 genera, Glomus, Entro- phospora, Acaulospora, Archaeospora, Paraglomus, Gigaspora, and Scutellospora. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi develop arbuscules or hyphal coils within host plant cortical cells, and have a wide host range including many agricultural and horticultural crops worldwide. Growth promotion has been seen in many AM-associated plants including maize  Baltruchat 1987 , tomato  Mohandas 1987 , asparagus  Pedersen et al. 1991 , Boston fern  Ponton et al. 1990 , and gerbera  Wang et al. 1993 . Despite the morphological differences between ecto- and arbuscular mycorrhizae, there appear to be many common features in their growth-promoting effects. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi develop extraradical hyphae that grow into the surrounding soil, increasing the potential of the root system for nutrient and water absorption, and improving the soil structure for better aeration and water penetration. One of the mechanisms of growth promotion by AM fungi involves the transport of phosphorus by AM fungi from the soil to the plant. Direct measurements of phosphorus transfer by AM fungal hyphae have been made by Jakobsen  1994  and Schweiger et al.  1999 . Colonization of roots by AM fungi modiﬁes the growth response of the plant and increases supplies of phosphorus  Abbott et al. 1995 , however, some studies have shown that effectiveness, in terms of plant growth promotion, is not related to the extent of host root colonization  Jensen  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   1982; Sanders and Fitter 1992 . Efﬁcient phosphorus uptake has been found to be more closely related to the quantity of mycelium partitioned into the extraradical phase of the fungi  Abbott and Robson 1985; Morin et al. 1994 . Jakobsen et al.  2001  reported that the phosphorus transport capacity of AM fungi is related not only to colonization rate, but also to the transport character of AM fungi themselves. The AM fungi cause few changes to root morphology, but the physiology of the host plant may change signiﬁcantly. Tissue concentrations of growth-regulating compounds and other chemical con- stituents change, photosynthetis rates increase, and the partitioning of photosynthate to shoots and roots changes  Bethlenfalvay 1992 . Allen et al.  1980  demonstrated differences in cytokinin content between Bouteloua gracilis plants with and without associated Glomus fasciculatus. They also reported quantitative and qualitative changes in GA-like substances in the leaves and roots of AM-associated plants  Allen et al. 1982 . Incleases in auxin, cytokinin, GA and B-vitamin production have also been reported in plants associated with ectomycorrhizal fungi  Crafts and Miller 1974; Slankis 1973; Strzelczyk et al. 1977 .  2.4 Endophyte  A widely accepted deﬁnition of an endophyte is; “endophytes symptomlessly colonize the living, internal tissues of their host, even though the endophyte may, after an incubation or latency period, cause disease”  Petrini 1991 . This deﬁnition includes virtually any microbe that colonizes the internal tissues of plants. For example, some plant-pathogenic fungi, such as the smut fungi, can be deﬁned as endophytes unless the plant shows symptoms after the infection  Stone et al. 2000 . Endophytes are generally known to enhance plant tolerance to environmental stresses, damage from harmful insects, and diseases caused by pathogens and nematodes. There are a few studies on the plant-growth promoting effect of endophytic fungi. Yetes et al.  1997  observed a slight but signiﬁcant increase in plant weight, shoot height, and shoot diameter in Fusarium moniliforme-infected plants, 28 days after planting compared to uninoculated control plants. Pinus contorta inoculated with Phialocephala fortinii increased uptake of phosphorus and nitrogen, that resulted in enhanced growth of inoculated plants compared with noninoculated plants  Jumpponen and Trappe 1998 .  3 FUNGI AS DISEASE SUPPRESSOR  3.1 PGPF  Almost all the PGPF reported so far have shown a pronounced suppressive effect against soil-borne diseases. One example of this is the suppression by Trichoderma harzianum of damping-off disease on barley, cucumber, radish, and tomato caused by Pythium ultimum  Ahmad and Baker 1988 . Nonpathogenic R. solani AG4 has been reported to suppress  tritici  and Cochliobolus  damping-off disease caused by virulent R. solani and R. zeae by 76 – 94% on cotton, radish, and wheat. The sterile fungi, SBF, SDF, and SRF, have been shown to decrease the occurrence of take-all disease of wheat caused by Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici  Dewan and Siva- sithamparam 1989; Narita and Suzuki 1991; Speakman and Kruger 1984 . The PGPF isolated from zoysiagrass rhizo- sphere have been shown high suppressive ability against soil-borne diseases caused by Pythium aphanidermatum, irregulare, R. solani, Sclerotium rolfsii, Fusarium P. f. sp. cucumerinum, oxysporum f. sp. melonis, F. o. G. graminis var. sativus  Hyakumachi 1994 . When cucumber plants inoculated with PGPF isolates from zoysiagrass rhizozphere, disease sup- pression was observed against the air-borne pathogen, Colletotrichum orbiculare  Meera et al. 1994 . In this work the PGPF were applied to plant roots and leaves were used for pathogen inoculation thereby the PGPF and pathogen were therefore suggests that physically separated. The result induced systemic resistance is involved as one of the mechanisms for disease suppression by PGPF. The PGPF rhizosphere, Trichoderma, isolates Fusarium, Penicillium, Phoma, and sterile fungi, all provided signiﬁcantly protection to air-borne anthracnose caused by C. orbiculare, bacterial angular leaf spot caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. lacrymaus, and soil-borne Fusarium wilt by F. oxysporum f. sp. cucumeris  Koike et al. 2001 . In the case of Fusarium wilt, a split-root system was used to ensure physical separation of PGPF and pathogen, and to assess induced resistance.  from zoysiagrass  3.2 Mycorrhizae  Initial evidence for the role of ectomycorrhizal fungi in disease suppression was provided by a number of ﬁeld observations that showed mycorrhizal-associated seedlings or trees of both angiosperms and gymnosperms were more resistant to root pathogens than their nonmycorrhizal counterparts  Marx 1973 . Ectomycorrhizal roots of various Pinus spp. and Sitka spruce  Picea sitchensis  seedlings were resistant to infection by a Rhizoctonia sp. that could readily roots  Levisohn 1954 . infected nonmycorrhizal Richard et al. the presence of ectomycorrhizal fungus, Suillus granulatus in the substratum completely prevented any negative effect of endophytic Mycelium radicis-atrovirens on Picea mariana seedlings. Hashimoto and Hyakumachi  2001  also suggested that the ectomycorrhizal fungi suppressed the deleterious effect of endophytic M. radicis-atrovirens on Betula platyphylla var. japonica seedlings.   1971  suggested that  feeder  Arbuscular mycorrhizae associations have been shown to reduce damage caused by soil-borne plant pathogens. Although few AM isolates have been fully studied, some appear to be more effective than others. Furthermore, the degree of protection varies with the pathogen involved, and can be modiﬁed by soil types and other environmental  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

Trotta et al.  1996  reported that the AM fungus, Glomus mosseae, reduced adventitious root necrosis and necrotic root apices caused by Phytophthora nicotianae var. parasitica by 63 – 89%. The AM associations are also known to limit the damage by bacterial pathogens and pathogenic root nematodes  Garcia-Garrido and Ocampo 1989; Hussey and Roncadori 1982 , however, the results are not consistent.  3.3 Endophyte  The enhanced resistance for disease shown by some endophyte-infected plants is generally considered to result from the production of defense compounds by the endophyte- plant infection. An example of this is the inoculation of maize kernels by endophytic Fusarium monilimorme, which is reported to protect against infection by pathogenic F. graminearum  Van Wyck and Scholts 1988 . Nonpatho- genic, endophytic strains of F. oxysporum isolated from suppressive soils have been used as biological control agents for manage diseases caused by pathogenic Fusarium species on watermelon, cucumber, celery, and other crops  Larkin et al. 1996; Schneider 1984 . In each case, these fungi were endophytes of the hosts they protected. Endophytic Hetero- conium chaetosprira is reported to almost completely suppress clubroot formation in Chinese cabbage caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae  Narisawa et al. 1998 .  4 MECHANISMS OF DISEASE  SUPPRESSION BY FUNGI  4.1 Antagonism  It  Many reports have shown that the growth-promoting effect of PGPF is due to their ability to suppress harmful micro- organisms in the soil. is generally accepted that hyperparasitism, antibiosis, and competition are all involved in the antagonistic activities of PGPF. The mechanisms of disease suppression by PGPF isolated from zoysiagrass are shown in Table 2. The isolates of PGPF did not show hyperparasitism to other fungi. In some cases involving Trichoderma there was a relation between antibiotic activity and disease suppression, however in most cases, disease suppression was closely related with the ability to compete for infection courts or nutrient on the surface of the plant root.  The production of antagonistic substances is thought to be one of the mechanisms of protection provided by ecto- mycorrhizal fungi. As an example of this, antibacterial activities have been demonstrated for Paxillus involutus and Hebeloma crustuliniforme in pure culture  Marx 1973  and for Cenococcum graniforme in mycorrhizal symbiosis  Krywolap et al. 1964 . The antibiotic effect of mycorrhizal fungi was attributed to the production of organic acids as demonstrated for P. involutus  Duchesne et al. 1989 . Olsson et al. the ecto- mycorrhizal mycelium decreased bacterial activities as   1996  demonstrated that presence of  Table 2 Mechanisms of disease suppression against pathogenic fungi and bacteria by plant growth-promoting fungi  PGPF  isolated from zoysiagrass  PGPF  Hyperparasitism  Antibiosis  Competition  Induced resistance  Pathogenic fungi  R. solani  P. irregulare  S. rolfsii  F. oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum  C. orbiculare  P. syringae pv. lachrimans  T. harzianum Phoma sp.

Zak  1964  suggested that ectomycorrhizal fungi may:  a  utilize surplus carbohydrates in the root thereby reducing the amount of nutrients stimulatory to pathogens,  b  provide a physical barrier, i.e., the fungal mantle, to penetration by pathogen,  c  secrete antibiotics inhibitory to pathogens, and  d  support along with the root, a protective microbial rhizosphere population. Marx  1969  suggested that inhibitors produced by symbiotically infected host cortical cells may also have a function as inhibitors of the infection and spread of pathogen in ectomycorrhizal roots.  Competition for colonization sites, direct antibiosis, nutritional aspects, and plant defense reaction have all been considered as possible mechanisms in disease suppression by AM fungi  Azcon-Aguilar and Barea 1996 . However, these mechanisms are still poorly understood. Antifungal activities are thought  to be involved in mechanisms of disease suppression by endophytic fungi. The endophytic fungi Neotyphodium coenophialum and N. lolii have been shown to form an inhibition zone under dual culture with the pathogenic fungi, Colletotrichum graminicola, Rhizoctonia cerealis, R. zeae, etc.  Siegel and Latch 1991 . These results suggest that these endophytic fungi produce antifungal substances. Volatile compounds were collected from both endophyte-infected and endophyte-free tall fescue, and the sheath of endophyte-infected plants was found to produce high levels of 1-octen-3-ol, a characteristic fungal toxic volatile compound derived from lipid per- oxidation in fungi, which was absent in endophyte-free plants  Yue et al. 2001 . Hydroxamate siderophore synthesis by P. fortinii, a typical dark septate fungal endophyte, was reported by Bartholdy et al.  2001 . Iron is an essential micronutrient for almost every organism and siderophore synthesis by P. fortinii may be expected to play a key role in iron nutrition for the plant, resulting in a lack of available iron for pathogens.  4.2  Induced Resistance  fungi  the soil  Induced-systemic resistance has been observed on cucumber plants treated with PGPF from zoysiagrass  Hyakumachi 1997; Koike et al. 2001; Meera et al. 1994 . Almost all of these PGPF could induce resistance against anthracnose in cucumber. In contrast, Ishiba et al.  1981  reported that only 1.9 – 2.4% of isolated from cucumber rhizosphere, were able to induce systemic resistance against anthracnose in cucumber plants. Different types of PGPF have been isolated from all over the world and it would be interesting to know if any of these have as high performance of induced systemic resistance as PGPF isolated from zoysiagrass. Recently, induced systemic resistance caused by binucleate Rhizoctonia and Trichoderma has been reported in plants. Some isolates within these fungi have growth- promoting ability and others have been used as biological control agents. The induced resistance on cucumber caused by PGPF isolated from zoysiagrass can last as long as 9 weeks  the mechanisms of  under glass house conditions and for up to 6 weeks under ﬁeld conditions  Meera et al. 1995 . Lignin deposition is known as one of induced systemic resistance  Hammaerschimidt and Kuc´ 1982 . Koike et al.  2001  reported that ligniﬁcation of cucumber seedling hypocotyls was induced by culture ﬁltrates of PGPF, following challenge inoculation with C. orbiculare. The result showed enhanced lignin deposition in cucumber after infection by C. orbiculare as compared to the control. The elicitor activity of culture ﬁltrates of PGPF has been evaluated by chemiluminescence to determine the emission of active oxygen species from tobacco callus and cucumber fruit disks  Koike et al. 2001 . The oxidative burst is characterized by a rapid and transient generation of active oxygen species immediately following fungal the . 12,000 MW fraction and both . 12,000 MW fraction and lipid fraction from the culture ﬁltrate elicited the highest superoxide generation, respectively.

From these  results,  elicitor  Localized and induced-systemic resistance against Phyto- phthora parasitica caused by the AM fungi, Glomus mosseae, has been observed in tomato roots  Cordier et al. 1998 . The phenomena were demonstrated by use of a split-root experimental system. Decreased pathogen development in mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal parts of the root system was associated with an accumulation of phenolics and plant cell defense responses. G. mosseae-containing cortical cells in the mycorrhizal tissues were immune to the pathogen infection and exhibited a localized resistance response with the formation of cell wall appositions reinforced by callose adjacent to intercellular hyphae. The systemically induced resistance in nonmycorrhizal root parts was characterized by elicitation of host wall thickenings containing nonesteriﬁed pectins and PR-1a protein in reaction to the intercellular hyphae of the pathogen. Systemic resistance was also characterized by the formation of callose-rich encasement material around P. parasitica hyphae that were penetrating root cells and PR-1a protein was detected in the pathogen wall only in these tissues. None of these cell reactions were observed in nonmycorrhizal pathogen-infected root systems, where disease development resulted in host cell death. Increased chitinase activities have also been reported in AM symbiosis as part of the induced defense reaction by these mycorrhizal studied b-1,3-glucanase in tomato roots which were either colonized by AM fungi and or infected by the pathogen Phytophthora parasitica. b-1,3-glucanase activity was higher roots compared to the non- infected by mycorrhizal P. parasitica showed high levels of activity but the pathogen did not induce b-1,3-glucanases in AM colonized roots. There was strong evidence to suggest these hydrolases are antifungal proteins.

In addition to this effect, subsequent studies have investigated direct suppressive effects on pathogens. Due to the large amount of research undertaken over the years, we now know that this view is limited. This chapter has focused on PGPF, mycorrhizal fungi, and endophytic fungi, all of which show efforts as plant growth promoters and disease suppressors, and the mechanisms of mineralization, hormone production, antagonism, and induced resistance have been considered. These mechanisms are commonly involved in plant-growth promotion or disease suppression by PGPF, mycorrhizal fungi, and endophytic fungi to some degree depending on the fungi studied. These fungi are symbiotic to plant roots, and so they offer advantages for keeping the plant healthy for long durations. In addition, mineralization and hormone production by these fungi have the potential to substantially improve agricultural pro- ductivity and to reduce environmental costs. The reduction in nitrogen fertilizer usage due to the use of these fungi can be expected to substantially reduce nitrate pollution of ground and surface water. In addition to these antagonistic activities, induced resistance in plants treated with these fungi broadens the potential range of pathogens that may be controlled. This resistance coupled with long-term colonization should provide important new tools for highly economical pest control with minimal environmental pollution.

Boyetchko   Gary Peng Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada  1  INTRODUCTION  The application of biological control for the management of weed populations has generally been viewed as an environmentally sound additional approach to chemical herbicides  Boyetchko et al. 2002; Mortensen 1998; Rosskopf et al. 1999 . Bioherbicides are often described as the intentional use of plant pathogens that are mass-produced, formulated, and applied at high inoculum rates in a similar fashion as chemicals. Although a variety of microbial agents may be used, host-speciﬁc fungal pathogens often referred to as mycoherbicides, have been studied more extensively for biocontrol of weeds. In comparison, classical biological control involves the importation of natural enemies and relies on the natural survival, dissemination, and self-perpetuation of the living agent for control of weeds below ecological thresholds. The classical approach is often considered more appropriate for low management systems such as pasture and rangeland where site disturbance is minimal, while bio- herbicides are ideal for single-season management of agricultural and forest weeds where site disturbance is the norm. Despite many economic, social, and environmental beneﬁts ascribed to biological control, it is reasonable to ask why more bioherbicide or mycoherbicide products are yet to become widely available in the marketplace. Many researchers would argue that there has been a great deal of progress, with several additional microbial agents identiﬁed as potential bioherbicides and innovative improvements in mass-pro- duction, formulation, and application of living organisms. Despite the various accomplishments by researchers world- wide  Boyetchko et al. 2002; Charudattan 2001 , the question remains whether we have made signiﬁcant advancements in bioherbicide research that would facilitate increased adoption of this technology. Several reviews have discussed in great  detail some of the limitations associated with bioherbicides  Auld and Morin 1995; Makowski 1997; Mortensen 1998 , including biological, environmental, and technological con- straints. Critics have attributed these constraints to the lack of further development of many biocontrol agents. This review will provide an update on the status of mycoherbicide research, summarize some of the challenges encountered, and provide some thoughts on potential new approaches that may be used to address these challenges in order to advance the development of promising mycoherbicide candidates.  2 STATUS OF BIOHERBICIDES  w  w   Table 1 . Devine  Several recent reviews have provided an overview on various bioherbicide projects being conducted around the globe  Boyetchko 1999; Boyetchko et al. 2002; Charudattan 2001; Rosskopf et al. 1999 . Eight bioherbicides have been registered in various countries over the last two decades with several other microbial candidates in various stages of and evaluation and development , the ﬁrst mycoherbicides registered in the United Collego States are currently marketed by Encore Technologies , a wood-decaying  Minnetonka, MN , while Stumpout fungus used to control is commercially available in South Africa. Chondrostereum purpureum is a wound pathogen that reduces regrowth of competing hardwood tree species and is marketed as BioChone by Koppert Biological Systems in the Nether- lands. A Canadian strain of the pathogen is also currently undergoing registration approval through the Canadian Pest Management Regulatory Agency and U.S. EPA and will be by MycoLogic  W.E.

Other examples of mycoherbicides have been discussed in greater detail by Boyetchko  1999 , Boyetchko et al.  2002 , and Rosskopf et al.  1999 . Charudattan  2001  has also compiled a comprehensive list of bioherbicide projects worldwide. While the number of commercial bioherbicides appears to be limited, Charudattan  1991  calculated a success ratio of 20:1 for bioherbicide development compared to the success rate of less than 1% for chemical herbicide compounds evaluated and developed by chemical companies. This success ratio begins to look even more encouraging for bioherbicides when developmental taken into consideration. Charudattan  2001  estimated that the resources and capital required for a chemical company to conduct research and development and register chemical herbicides is approxi- mately US$ 50 million in comparison to US$2 million for bioherbicides. Nevertheless, a very small portion  i.e., less than 1%  of the commercially available weed control products are represented by bioherbicides and investment in these microbial-based products has largely been by small-to- medium sized enterprises. Government and university institutions have invested infrastructure and expertise in this area and it has been through such efforts that this technology has been transferred to industry.  costs  are  3 CHALLENGES IN BIOLOGICAL  CONTROL  Several reviews have provided a suggested list of desirable characteristics for a bioherbicide candidate in order for it to be successful  Charudattan 1991; Makowski 1997; Mortensen 1998 . Generally, these traits include:  a  a narrow host range,  b  ease of use,  c  genetic stability,  d  ability to mass produce inoculum cost-effectively with long shelf life, and  e  ability to be fast-acting with predictable ﬁeld performance and provide sufﬁcient weed control comparable to chemical herbicides. Many of these traits, along with the term bioherbicide  mycoherbicide , may create unrealistic expec- tations that all bioherbicides should eradicate weed   a  biological,   b  environmental,  to chemical herbicides   Auld and populations, similar that have limited the Morin 1995 . The challenges advancement of bioherbicides have been categorized into four constraints:  c  technological, and  d  commercial. While the commercial consideration is focus on three constraints. Researchers can addressing the other make pragmatic decisions on the selection of an appropriate target weed that may have impact on the market decisions by industry to invest in the development of bioherbicide agents, but the regulatory environment for registration of such products is often affected by political will and or policy of individual governments.  review will  important,  this  3.1 Biological Factors  Weeds are inherently variable by nature, with many weed species possessing several biotypes. For this reason, the genetic diversity of weed populations can present several challenges when researchers evaluate speciﬁc isolates or strains of fungal pathogens  Auld and Morin 1995; Boyetchko et al. 2002 . Such is the case with yellow nutsedge that was found to have extensive genetic variability within and between populations and, therefore, greater variability in susceptibility to the bioherbicide agent Puccinia canaliculata, compared to purple nutsedge populations  Horak et al. 1987; Okoli et al. 1997 . The success of Colletotrichum gloeo- sporioides f. sp. aeschynomene as the mycoherbicide was attributed to the uniform susceptibility of the Collego weed northern jointvetch  Templeton et al. 1984 . A better understanding of the target weed population structure will contribute to the effective search for bioherbicide agents with consistent performance on genetically diverse weed species  Boyetchko et al. 2002 . Another consideration is the view that all bioherbicide candidates must be speciﬁc to one particular weed species. The advantage of a highly host- speciﬁc bioherbicide candidate is the assurance that nontarget, beneﬁcial plant species, or crops closely related to the weed will not be affected  Makowski 1997; Mortensen 1998 . However, a strict host-range requirement may not be  w  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   economically feasible because the majority of agroeco- systems are comprised of multispecies weed communities  Frantzen et al. 2001 . Plurivorous pathogens may be used safely under certain circumstances when they can be separated sufﬁciently from nontarget hosts in space and time  De Jong et al. 1999 . Plant architecture and morphology have played a role in the success or failure of bioherbicide agents. The majority of weed species selected as targets for biological control have been broad-leaved weeds using foliar fungal pathogens  Charudattan 1991; 2001 . Grasses are considered more difﬁcult to control because the meristem is covered by a leaf sheath thereby prohibiting direct attack by the pathogen  Greaves and MacQueen 1992 . Grass weeds are also closely related to many crops  e.g., cereals  in which they occur, making selectivity of mycoherbicide agents more challenging  Wapshere 1990 . A particularly important factor with perennial weeds is their regeneration via rhizomes and stolons, which makes long-term weed control difﬁcult  Greaves and MacQueen 1992 . This often results in the weed out-growing the disease caused by foliar-applied bioherbicide candidates. However, there are many pros- pective soilborne fungal and bacterial agents that may be used as pre-emergent bioherbicides to control Poaceae and perennial weed species  Boyetchko et al. 2002 . Other physical barriers such as leaf hairs and waxy cuticle layers may act as impediments to infection and establishment of fungal pathogens on the phyllosphere  Auld and Morin 1995 . Although high inoculum applications have been used to overcome biological constraints resulting from low infection efﬁciency or virulence of the pathogen, these rates may not be technologically feasible due to plugging of spray equipment or economically viable from a production standpoint.  3.2 Environmental Factors  Two major limiting factors that have an impact on mycoherbicides are temperature and moisture requirements  Auld and Morin 1995; Makowski 1997; Mortensen 1998 . TeBeest et al.  1992  considered temperature to be less important than moisture in most cases because many fungal pathogens will infect plants over a broad range of temperatures. However, there is often an interaction between temperature and moisture that has a greater effect than temperature alone. Free moisture and leaf wetness duration can signiﬁcantly affect the ability of the fungal pathogen to germinate, produce penetration structures, and ultimately cause plant infection. This requirement of leaf wetness duration often increases when temperatures are in suboptimal ranges. Early evaluations of potential mycoherbicide candidates have often been conducted where dew periods in excess of 12 h are provided to ensure a high rate of infection on the weed  Lawrie et al. 1999; McRae and Auld 1988; Morin et al. 1990a . Green and Bailey  2000a,b  reported that A. cirsinoxia for control of Canada thistle required at least 8 h  of continuous leaf wetness. The pathogen infected the weed under a broad range of temperatures  10 – 308C  when free water or high relative humidity was present, but long durations of intermittent leaf wetness was detrimental to survival of germlings and, therefore, not conducive to high bioherbicidal activity. Some pathogens such as rust fungi are wind-dispersed and generally require less moisture than water-disseminated pathogens such as Colletotrichum spp. where spores are contained in a mucilaginous matrix  Hasan and Wapshere 1973; TeBeest 1991 . Makowski  1997  further reiterated that evaluating the impact of environ- mental parameters under controlled conditions may provide clues about potential performance of bioherbicide candi- dates, but investigations under variable ﬁeld conditions where these factors are difﬁcult to control are more complicated.  further  3.3 Technological Factors  represents a strong determining factor  The feasibility of commercializing bioherbicide agents has often been dependent on the ease and economics of mass- producing and formulating large amounts of viable, stable, and highly efﬁcacious microbial propagules  Auld and Morin 1995; Mortensen 1998; Slininger et al. 1998 . It is generally believed that submerged liquid fermentation is the most efﬁcient commercial mass-production method for most biocontrol agents  Jackson et al. 1996 . Although general guidelines or common fermentation ingredients for medium composition are available in public domains  Stanbury et al. 1995 , most commercial fermentation protocols are custom designed for a speciﬁc organism and details are generally treated as trade secrets. However, when a company licenses a bioherbicide technology, the ability to mass-produce the agent economically and market it at a cost that is affordable to farmers, in its development and commercialization potential. Lack of reliable ﬁeld performance due to inadequate formulation and application technology has often been cited as a major reason for the lack of progress in bioherbicides  Greaves et al. 2000; Peng et al. 2001 . It has been claimed that suitable formulation technology may help address some of the environmental constraints, particularly moisture requirements that often hinder the advancement of bioherbicide candidates beyond the discovery and evaluation phase. Propagules of foliar-applied fungal agents generally require free water to germinate and penetrate weeds. This leaf wetness requirement and its interaction with the ambient temperature often determine the outcome of a mycoherbicide application  Zhang and Watson 1997 . Often, researchers evaluate mycoherbicide candidates by spraying till runoff, thereby overestimating the potential of many bioherbicide candidates at the early stage of evaluation  Lawrie et al. 1999 . Less stringent dew requirement may be an advantage for foliar agents, especially in semiarid climates such as the Canadian prairies, where rainfall is infrequent at critical periods  e.g., in the spring .

At any stage of evaluation, reﬁnements or modiﬁcations to these processes, even minor, may result improvements in mycoherbicide performance.  in signiﬁcant  4 APPROACHES FOR OVERCOMING  4.1 Selection and Improvement of Bioherbicide  CONSTRAINTS  Agents  is  Most mycoherbicide programs are initiated through surveys to discover fungal pathogens exhibiting bioherbicidal potential, followed by a series of biological and ecological assessments to determine the feasibility of mycoherbicide candidates. However, a pragmatic approach of selecting appropriate mycoherbicide candidates required and should be considered as a continuum amongst several factors that will ultimately inﬂuence the ﬁeld performance of the fungal pathogen  Figure 1 . While nutritional and physical factors are vital during fermentation, down-stream processing is equally important for an efﬁcient mass- production system. Selection of appropriate formulation technology is inﬂuenced by fermentation processes and should be based on critical limitations such as shelf life and environmental constraints encountered with mycoherbicide development. Formulation ingredients can affect delivery and application of these ingredients result in the inability to deliver the fungal pathogen to the target weed  e.g., high viscosity and ultimate plugging of equipment , effective weed control will not be achieved. Often, mass-production, formulation, and application can be interrelated, therefore, changes in one of  the mycoherbicide agent.  If  On average, chemical companies screen more than 60,000 compounds before a new active ingredient of pesticide can be determined. The number required for screening biocontrol agents should be less due to a relatively smaller range of variations amongst naturally occurring fungal populations. However, if we are to identify “nature’s best,” a systematic approach is essential during the exploration and discovery phase to thoroughly evaluate the biodiversity. This diversity provides excellent opportunities for ﬁnding fungal strains with potential suitable traits for biocontrol  Avis et al. 2001; Weidemann and TeBeest 1990 . Substantial variations may exist amongst different strains of a fungal species in terms of its virulence and responses to environmental variables  Sands et al. 1997; Tessmann et al. 2001 . To be effective, critical traits for selection should be clearly identiﬁed and sensitive bioassays developed. Pathogen strains with high levels of virulence may exist in nature at low frequencies due to higher extinction rates  Yang and TeBeest 1992 . Results by Yang and TeBeest  1992; 1993  indicated that pathogens showing high virulence along with important epidemiological traits such as rapid infection rates and dispersal are more likely to be candidates of a successful mycoherbicide agent. The success  Figure 1 Strategic framework for evaluation and development of mycoherbicides.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   of C. gloeosporioides f. sp. aeschynomene for control of northern jointvetch was partially attributed to its ability to easily spread as an endemic pathogen. Yang and TeBeest  1995  further demonstrated a rapid rate of mortality of the weed as the number of pathogen lesions per plant increased from a single lesion. Therefore, more aggressive and virulent isolates of a pathogen with high infection efﬁciency, shorter latent periods, and better sporulation from diseased tissues should be selected from amongst the pathogen population. Chemical and physical methods have been used to create fungal mutants with acquired new traits such as elevated antibiotic production  Graeme-Cook and Faull 1991  or increased biocontrol efﬁcacy  Palani and Lalithakumari 1999 . Stability or low reversion frequency was observed with some mutants but, in general, stability can be a concern with chemical and physical mutagenesis  Wibowo et al. 1999 . Ziogas et al.  1995  reported UV-induced mutants of Nectria haematococca with variable tolerance to fungicides that showed the same level of ﬁtness as wild types as expressed by the rate of growth and virulence on squash seedlings. Mutagenesis is apparently a quick way of creating new fungal strains with variable traits. However, efﬁcient bioassay systems based on the understanding of critical constraints are needed for an effective selection strategy. It is not uncommon for induced mutants to have lower competi- tiveness than the wild type due to reduced infectivity or reproductivity  Yang and TeBeest 1995 , but judicious use of this technique may help develop new mycoherbicide strains that overcome critical hurdles such as those demonstrated with the plurivorous pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum  Miller et al. 1989 .  4.2 Fermentation Mass Production  w  w  and Devine  There are potentially three fermentation systems that may be used for mass production of mycoherbicide agents: submerged liquid culture, solid substrate fermentation, and two-phase system  Auld 1993a . At the industrial level, liquid fermentation is the most common method for economical production of microbial inoculum. Two commercial myco- , are manufactured this herbicides, Collego way in the United States  Churchill 1982; Stowell 1991 . By understanding the importance of nutritional and environ- mental factors on induction of fungal sporulation, spore yield, and bioherbicidal efﬁcacy, rational approaches can be taken to develop the most efﬁcient liquid production procedures for mycoherbicide agents. Jackson and Bothast  1990  reported that carbon concentrations and C N ratios are the key to sporulation of the mycoherbicide agent C. truncatum. Carbon concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 1.5% gave highest spore yields while higher concentrations  2 – 4%  inhibited sporula- tion. Similarly, a C N ratio at 15:1 was more favorable for sporulation than 40:1 or 5:1. In a further study, it was revealed that nutritional aspects impacted not only spore yield, but also spore efﬁcacy of C. truncatum in controlling hemp sesbania  Jackson et al. 1996 . Morin et al.  1990b  also observed that  sporulation of Phomopsis convolvulus was completely inhibited when the C N ratio was reduced from 1:1 to 1:5 using modiﬁed Richards medium, but the effect on spore efﬁcacy was not reported. By understanding these impacts, fermentation procedures can be ﬁne-tuned to maximize the production and potency of mycoherbicide agents. One of the drawbacks with liquid fermentation is that down-stream processing can be more complicated and costly. Large centrifuges are normally required to spin off spores and often a large number of spores can be imbedded in the mycelial biomass  Auld 1993a . Following recovery from the fermentor, it is usually necessary to dry the spores for long- term storage but retaining spore viability during the drying process may not be easy. Generally, spores should be dried rapidly and gently, but the drying conditions will vary with each organism. Drying methods frequently used include freeze, air, spray, or ﬂuid-bed drying, or a combination of these methods  Churchill 1982 . Solid substrate fermentation is used less commonly in commercial production of microbes except for the mushroom spawn industry. Often deﬁned nutrients are added with liquids or solid materials such as vermiculite or paper pellets  Auld 1993a . Various cereal grains have been used to produce fungal inoculum and it is relatively easy to quantify and disperse the inoculum on these solid substrates  Boyette et al. 1991 . In some places nutritive solid substances such as nutshells or straw may be available locally at labor costs, difﬁculties in maintaining sterility, lack of control of cultural conditions, and recovery of spores from the substrate are inherent problems with solid substrate fermentation  Churchill 1982 . Pﬁrter et al.  1999  evaluated a variety of solid substrates and found that Stagonospora convolvuli, for control of ﬁeld bindweed, sporulated the best on cous-cous  cracked hard  wheat  followed by maize semolina, yielding 5 £ 108 spores g substrate and 3 £ 108 spores g, respectively. Morin et al.  1990b  also reported the production of 7 £ 108 conidia g  low cost. Higher  with P. convolvulus using pot barley grain as a solid substrate. They also compared liquid and solid fermentation methods and found that conidia produced using both systems were morphologically similar and there were no differences in pathogenicity. Particle size, moisture content, and tem- perature appear critical for successful solid substrate production. A mycoharvester developed at CABI Bioscience  www.dropdata.net mycoharvester  appears to be a simple device for collecting spores of the mycoinsecticide fungus, Metarhizium anisopliae, produced on rice grains. This device has also been attempted to reduce inoculum impurity of the mycoherbicide Pyricularia setariae  Gary Peng, unpublished data . By reducing the proportion of large particles in the inoculum, the mycoherbicide can be applied at high spore concentrations and low carrier volumes using common spray equipment  Peng et al. 2001 . A two-phase system produces mycelium in deep tank fermentation followed by sporulation in shallow open trays. This method may be particularly useful for fungal agents that cannot be manipulated to sporulate in submerged culture, but this system is labor-intensive and expensive, and additional handling of the material may lead to  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   contamination of the ﬁnal product  Rosskopf et al. 1999 . Liquid fermentation produces a large amount of biomass efﬁciently and sporulation in a “dry phase” may circumna- vigate costly down-stream processing issues. Walker  1980  used A. macrospora as a model system to ﬁrst produce fungal mycelium in a liquid, then homogenize and mix it with vermiculite, followed by thinly spreading the homogenate on a solid surface. Using a similar system, Walker and Riley  1982  successfully produced spores of A. cassiae, a mycoherbicide agent for control of sicklepod. One area of fermentation that can often be overlooked is the feasibility of scale-up from shake ﬂask laboratory volumes to production- plant level. Optimization of fermentation conditions and media components can be readily achieved in the laboratory while pilot-plant scale fermentation can help to effectively verify these selected parameters  Kwanmin 1989 . Some sophisticated pilot-scale devices with consistent designs to large-scale facilities are now available. These units are particularly useful for scale-up studies and provide a wide range of pH, agitation speeds, impeller designs, aeration rates, choices of regulated incoming gases, variations in bafﬂing and background pressures, and temperatures  Churchill 1982 . However, conditions required to reach optimal yield, costs, and efﬁciencies in production scale fermentation can be more difﬁcult to achieve. Some biological factors that need to be considered are culture stability, number of generations, and mutation rate while chemical factors include pH, water quality, and fermentation medium quality. Physical factors that should be evaluated include aeration, agitation, pressure, temperature, and medium sterilization. Kwanmin  1989  indicated that factors that may not have been important at a smaller scale could have signiﬁcant impact on the operation and design of fermentation processes at the production plant level.  4.3 Formulation  It is believed that many of the environmental challenges, particularly long dew period or leaf wetness requirements, can be tackled to a large extent with formulation technologies  Boyetchko et al. 1999; Greaves et al. 2000; Green et al. 1998 . Formulation is essentially the blending of microbial propagules with a range of carriers or adjuvants to produce a form that can be effectively delivered to target weeds. For microbial agents, formulation may enhance pathogen survival and infection as well as extend propagule stability and product shelf life. Depending on the type of organism, mode of action, and available spray equipment, formulation ingredients vary substantially. For instance, foliar-applied agents may be exposed to rain-wash, UV irradiation, and desiccation prior to germination and penetration  Rhodes 1993 . Therefore, various adjuvants with adhesive, sun- blocking, or humectant properties have been suggested to alleviate the negative impact by these factors  Schisler et al. 1995; Womack and Burge 1993 . Formulations that increase moisture-retaining properties, reduce the rate of evaporation  that  and or enhance the rate of infection of the mycoherbicide agent should be explored to address dew limitations. In the literature, emulsions and hydrophilic polymers are reported most frequently to improve the performance of foliar-applied mycoherbicide agents. Formulation research has focused particularly on desiccation and dew requirements of fungal agents during the infection process and incremental to drastic improvements have been seen in different studies  Auld 1993b; Connick et al. 1990; Lawrie et al. 2000; Shabana 1997 . There is a growing belief innovations in formulation will be a vital component to the success of the next generation of bioherbicides, especially for foliar-applied products  Greaves et al. 1998 . For best results, formulations should predispose weeds to infection by pathogens and buffer pathogen propagules against environmental extremes while promoting disease development. Nutrient supplements, including simple sugars, amino acids, pectins, salts, and plant extracts have been added to formulations to stimulate the infection process and protect germinating propagules, but these nutritional effects are often agent speciﬁc  Bothast et al. 1993; Schisler et al. 1995; Womack and Burge 1993 . Exogenous nutrients may stimulate germination and growth of many fungi, but frequently appressorial initiation is even more important to plant penetration and infection. Oversupply of nutrients can lead to excessive growth of germlings, delaying, or even reducing appressorial formation and penetration  Takano et al. 1997 . Tremendous efforts have been made on developing various emulsions to alleviate moisture constraints, thereby enhancing ﬁeld performance. Invert emulsions showed the most impressive results by reducing or even eliminating the need for dew with several fungal agents  Connick et al. 1991b; Yang et al. 1993 . Bioherbicidal control of hemp sesbania using C. truncatum in an invert emulsion was signiﬁcantly enhanced under ﬁeld conditions  Boyette et al. 1993 . Invert emulsions consist of water droplets suspended in oil and evaporation of the trapped water is dramatically reduced and microbial propagules held in the water are, therefore, protected  Daigle et al. 1990; Womack and Burge 1993 . Despite the apparent improve- ment, invert emulsions can be very complex, difﬁcult to apply using existing spray equipment due to extreme viscosity and may exhibit phytotoxicity in many plant species  Boyette 1994; Womack et al. 1996 . Although these invert emulsions have been used to expand the host range of mycoherbicides  Yang and Jong 1995 , this change may also affect nontarget crops. High oil content also makes invert emulsions more costly, especially when high spray volumes are required. Being nonevaporative, oils were considered a compatible carrier with ultra-low volume application techniques for the mycoinsecticide M. anisopliae under extremely dry con- ditions  Bateman and Alves 2000 . In contrast to invert emulsions, oil suspension emulsions are considered to be more practical because they have signiﬁcantly lower oil content and can be applied with most existing spray equipment  Green et al. 1998 . Fungal propagules can be ﬁrst suspended in oils, then mixed with a much larger volume of water containing an emulsiﬁer to make stable emulsions  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   w  w  , and Evergreen   Auld 1993b . Klein et al.  1995  used suspension emulsions of C. orbiculare made from two vegetable and mineral oils that were mixed and applied with water ranging in concentrations from 0.5 to 10% for control of Xanthium spinosum under ﬁeld conditions. These formulations enhanced weed control in several ﬁeld trials compared to water as a carrier sprayed at similar application volumes. Oils may have variable effects on propagule germination and performance of mycoherbicide agents. Parafﬁn oils were toxic to spores of Ascochyta pteridis, a mycoherbicide candidate for bracken, Pteridium aquilinum  Womack et al. 1996 , while unreﬁned corn oil enhanced spore germination of C. truncatum in emulsions containing 10 – 50% of oil  Boyette 1994; Egley and Boyette 1995 . The mechanisms by which the oil suspension emulsions enhance mycoherbicidal activity are not well understood. Emulsions may help maintain the stability and infectivity of fungal propagules prior to onset of dew  Green et al. 1998 . Spray retention is likely enhanced, reducing the spore dose required for effective weed control. Moisture retention has also been w demonstrated with hydrophylic polymers such as Kelgin xanthan gum, Gellan gum, N-Gele, HV, MV, LV, Kelzan 500  Shabana et al. 1997 . Metamucil These polymers enhanced viability, germination, and efﬁcacy of the mycoherbicide agents A. cassiae and A. eichhorniae.   are known to Humectants such as psyllium  e.g., Metamucil have high moisture retention properties and reduce the rate of moisture loss  Greaves et al. 2000 . Coformulation of the mycoherbicide agent, A. caulina, with the skinning agent enhanced control of polyvinyl alcohol and Metamucil Chenopodium album under reduced dew conditions. For mycoherbicides applied to the soil, encapsulation of the fungi in solid matrices is more suitable than liquid formulations. Calcium alginate has been used to mix fungal spores with a variety of carriers such as kaolin clay, ground oatmeal, soy ﬂour, and cornmeal  Boyette and Walker 1986; Walker and Connick 1983; Weidemann and Templeton 1988 . Conidial production and ﬁeld efﬁcacy can be enhanced by amending the mixture with various nutrients  Daigle and Cotty 1992; Weidemann 1988 . “Pesta” has also been used as a type of granular formulation where fungal propagules are entrapped in a wheat-gluten matrix consisting of semolina ﬂour, kaolin, and fungal biomass  Connick et al. 1991a . Further development of this process has resulted in the formation of uniform granules using a twin-screw extruder and by controlling the moisture content through ﬂuid-bed drying  Connick et al. 1998 .  w  w  w  4.4 Application Technology  Delivery and retention of sufﬁcient number of fungal propagules on weeds can be very challenging. Most initial studies on mycoherbicide efﬁcacy spray the inoculum to the weed foliage till runoff using aerosol sprayers. This spray method generally applies excessive volumes  up to 3000 l ha  that can maximize the retention and exaggerate the potential  of biocontrol agents  Greaves et al. 2000 . Disregard for appropriate methods of application can contribute to poor or inconsistent ﬁeld performance  Smith and Bouse 1981 . In most ﬁeld crops, application volumes over 600 l ha are considered high  Matthews 1992 , and the trend is generally toward lower volumes.  Use of high spore concentrations can potentially reduce application volumes without compromising the efﬁcacy of weed control  Peng et al. 2001 . Increased propagule number may help improve the efﬁciency of foliar coverage by reducing the proportion of “empty” droplets  Jones 1998 , but also pose high requirements on quantity and quality of the inoculum necessary to achieve the desired level of weed control. Mycelium clumps or other impurities in extremely concentrated formulations can also easily plug up the spray system. Inoculum concentration, carrier volume, and other spray parameters need to be studied jointly to optimize spray results  Jones and Burges 1998 . Nordbo et al.  1993  suggested use of fast travel speed to improve spray retention on vertical leaf surfaces. In a recent study, Peng et al.  2001  observed that a ﬁner droplet spectrum combined with more horizontal trajectories enhanced retention efﬁciency on green foxtail. Richardson  1987  and Spillman  1984  made similar suggestions on application of herbicides. These retention characteristics have also been discussed by Jones  1998  and Reichard  1988 , and have been used to explain improved spray results in a number of herbicide studies  Knoche 1994 . It needs to be recognized that there are limitations with manipulation of certain spray parameters. For instance, too ﬁne a spray may not be practical in every case depending on the size of mycoherbicide propagules and due to potential spray drift concerns  Jones 1998 . Interpretation of droplet size spectra for optimal dose transfer of biopesticides is required, and this will vary with the mycoherbicide agent, particularly in relation to the spore size and morphology  Bateman 1999 . Although ﬁne tuning of application parameters can improve spray characteristics, is more important these improvements can be translated into meaningful enhancements of weed control efﬁcacy.  to determine if  it  4.5 Herbicide Synergy  As stand-alone products, mycoherbicides have achieved limited success in the marketplace. Technologies such as formulation and application methods can improve the performance of biocontrol agents, but more noticeable enhancements in weed control have been observed with the combined application of mycoherbicide agents and synergis- tic herbicides  Peng et al. 2000; Sharon et al. 1992; Wymore et al. 1987 . Limited information seems to suggest that synergistic interactions are herbicide and pathogen speciﬁc. Use of glyphosate on Canada thistle assisted weed control by A. cirsinoxia only marginally, especially under ﬁeld conditions  Bailey et al. 2000 . Peng et al.  2000  compared two groups of herbicides, bentazon and metribuzin, for  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   0  interaction with a fungal pathogen on scentless chamomile, a noxious weed in the Canadian prairies. Preliminary results revealed signiﬁcant fresh weight reduction by up to 150% with applications of herbicides plus the pathogen compared to herbicides alone. Tank-mixing of C. coccodes with thidazuron  N-phenyl-N -1,2,3-thiadiazol-5-yl-urea  also increased the mortality of velvetleaf when compared to the application of the mycoherbicide alone in ﬁeld trials  Wymore et al. 1987 . The application of a sublethal dose of glyphosate with A. cassiae resulted in an increase in susceptibility of the weed sicklepod  Sharon et al. 1992 . As a result, equivalent control was achieved with ﬁve times less inoculum of the mycoherbicide agent. The herbicide was believed to interfere with the shikimate acid pathway that is involved in the elicitation of phytoalexins, low molecular weight antimicrobial compounds involved in a plant’s defense response. Subsequent interference with the plant’s defense mechanism resulted in greater susceptibility of the target weed to the mycoherbicide  Hoagland 1996 . This synergistic interaction appears to be an attractive mechanism to enhance the effectivity and feasibility of mycoherbicide agents. According to Hoagland  1996 , several beneﬁts may be captured with the application of microbe herbicide synergy:  a  when defense capabilities of weeds are lowered using herbicides, weeds become more susceptible to pathogen attack,  b  the quantity of mycoherbicide agent or the application rate of herbicides may be reduced, and  c  host range of a given mycoherbicide agent may be expanded with the use of selected chemical synergists.  5 CONCLUSION  The identiﬁcation of efﬁcacious biological control agents is only the beginning in the development of mycoherbicide products. Continuing strain selection is essential to ensure that “nature’s best” is employed. Likely there will always be limitations associated with naturally occurring organisms, therefore, enabling technologies such as fermentation, formulation, and application technology will be instrumental in determining whether a highly efﬁcacious agent can be developed into an economically feasible mycoherbicide product. The ultimate goal is to incorporate mycoherbicides into agricultural production systems. More efforts should be directed into combining biocontrol agents with other weed control options including chemical herbicides, cultural practices, and use of the multiple pathogens to enhance the effectiveness and ﬂexibility of integrated weed management systems and to reduce the chemical load on crops and in the environment  Boyetchko et al. 2002; Rosskopf et al. 1999 . The challenge is to critically evaluate the merits of individual mycoherbicide candidates and to make realistic decisions whether they have all the essential characteristics required for successful application in agroecosystems. Based on discus- sions presented in this review, the following research priorities are suggested for development of mycoherbicide candidates:   a  Assessment of natural strain variation and bio- diversity within the pathogen population based on critical epidemiological characteristics, including environmental adaptation, virulence, dispersal, and infection efﬁciency.   b  Evaluation of key areas for efﬁcient scale-up mass-production based on fundamental elements relating to nutritional and physical requirements of speciﬁc fungal agents that facilitate selection of economical fermentation ingredient substitutes, along with down-stream processing procedures that are compatible with production methods.   c  Selection of appropriate formulation technologies  i.e., liquid or solid-matrices  based on the mode of attack and critical efﬁciencies of candidate agents. Over-simpliﬁcation of formulation by using single ingredients will not likely address the complex challenges that fungal organisms will encounter in the environment, including moisture constraints, temperature extremes, and UV irradiation.   d  Critical factors in application technology related to placement and penetration of the crop canopy to the target weed in order to maximize application efﬁciency. These factors include leaf-wetting properties and ability to penetrate physical barriers  e.g., waxy cuticles and leaf hairs , retention and dispersal on the leaf surface, optimum dose transfer in various liquid droplets or solid-based granules, and selection of application equipment such as nozzle types and angle position or soil-application placement  e.g., within furrow application, side- banding, etc. . Application parameters should also be evaluated jointly with formulation ingredients. Integration of mycoherbicide agents into crop production systems using several weed management tools  e.g., synergy with chemical herbicides, combinations with other biological control agents, or weed control options  to optimize weed control effectiveness. Judicious use of mycoherbicides as one of the components in an integrated weed management system will enhance their value and practicality for control of multispecies weed communities in agroecosystems.   e   REFERENCES  Auld BA  1993a .

Despite the enormous advances in chemical management of fungal diseases, some of the important plant pathogens such as vascular wilt, anthracnoses, take-all of wheat, and other root infections remain uncontrolled by current fungicidal chemicals  Knight et al. 1997 . The build-up of resistant strains of target pathogens and the increasing public concern about synthetic fungicides have intensiﬁed the need for better and safer compounds in terms of novel modes of action, low rates of use, and low toxicological and environmental risk  Godfrey 1994; Tanaka and O¯ mura 1993 . As the requirements for new environmental and commercial fungicides become more demanding, is increasingly difﬁcult to discover new class of compounds to justify the effort and the costs of development. In order to get a chance to discover new fungicides that meet the mentioned character- istics, the exploitation of biologically active natural products is becoming mainstream in antifungal agent research.  it  Microbial metabolites represented by antibiotics have a number of chemical and biological merits as fungicides. Microorganisms are capable of synthesizing versatile chemical structures with diverse biological activities beyond the scope of synthetic organic chemistry  Porter 1985 . An unexpected and newly found chemical structure is more likely to have new fungicidal activity and mode of action, especially showing no cross-resistance to the commercial fungicides  Fru¨h et al. 1996 . Biodegradability is the next property of microbial metabolites that cannot be overlooked. They degrade usually within a month or even a few days, when  exposed to agricultural environment, thus leading to the low residual level less harmful to the natural ecosystem  Tanaka and Omura 1993 .  Microbial metabolites can be exploited in a number of different ways for the development of new fungicides. They can be directly used as fungicide products or as leads for the design of novel synthetic products. Alternatively, they can be used to highlight novel mode of action available as a new screening target. The recent successes in fungicide develop- ment came mainly from the discovery of potent lead compounds followed by chemical modiﬁcations that gave additional useful features fungicides. Potent antifungal activity is not the only factor to decide whether the microbial metabolite can be used as a commercial fungicide. Along with the chemical stability in the ﬁeld, it should also have residual activity enough to reduce the application time to the economical level and low volatibility sufﬁcient to stay on the surface of host plants. Overall, it is very unlikely that a newly discovered microbial metabolite might possess all of the desired properties. Therefore, moving away from the viewpoint of antifungal metabolites as ﬁnal products, microbial metabolites are currently reexploited as a source of enormously diverse chemical library that can supply lead compounds for development of fungicides. As seen in the example of the successful development of methoxyacrylates that are expected to be a major fungicide class in the future, it is not surprising that natural products are facing a revival as lead compounds for fungicide development.  The advances in molecular, biological, and chemical techniques made it possible to reinvestigate microbial metabolites from a totally different point of view. The increasing knowledge about the complex multidisciplinary  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   mystery of antifungal activity enables us to design a rationalized screening system based on the mode of action. Along with the innovative screening systems, the powerful instruments available for puriﬁcation and structural elucida- tion of natural products have made it possible to adopt a high throughput approach to natural product screening  Bindseil et al. 2001 .  In this chapter, we will review  a  microbial metabolites currently used as fungicides,  b  on-going efforts to discover lead compounds from diverse microbial sources, and  c  fungal speciﬁc targets to be used for screening of potential antifungal leads. In the later part of this review, we will discuss  c  trends in biofungicide research and inter- disciplinary approaches to diversify their chemical library, which may yield novel antifungal compounds in the future.  2 MICROBIAL METABOLITES IN USE AS  BIOFUNGICIDES  The most important antifungal metabolites in commercial use are listed below, which are applied to control fungal diseases on rice, vegetable, and fruits. The relative importance of the microbial compounds, when compared to synthetic fungi- cides, might have been underevaluated because of several reasons such as the limitation in their spectrum of activity and in certain instances, the development of resistance. Never- theless, the excellent activity of these biofungicides inspired to launch the screening programs for antifungal microbial metabolites, which resulted in profound chemical libraries of natural products  Godfrey 1994; Knight et al. 1997 .  Blasticidin S, the ﬁrst microbial fungicide available for plant protection, has been used practically for the control of rice blast disease caused by Magnaporthe grisea. Blasticidin S is a nucleoside antibiotic discovered from metabolites of Streptomyces griseochromogenes  Takeuchi et al. 1957 . It potently inhibits the mycelial growth and conidial germina- tion of M. grisea. The successful use of the compound encouraged further screening of microbial fungicides that eventually brought out kasugamycin, polyoxin, validamycin, and mildiomycin.  Kasugamycin is an amino-sugar compound discovered in the metabolites of Streptomyces kasugaensis and Strepto- myces kasugaspinus  Umezawa et al. 1965 . It has in vitro antimicrobial activity against yeast and some plant patho- genic fungi including M. grisea. In vivo data showed that kasugamycin efﬁciently suppressed the development of M. grisea mycelia on rice plants by both preventive and curative treatments. However, it did not appear to inhibit the spore germination.  Polyoxins were isolated from the culture broth of Streptomyces cacaoi var. asoensis  Suzuki et al. 1965 . The excellent in vitro activity and in vivo efﬁcacy led to its commercial use for the control of fungal diseases of fruit trees and vegetables such as black spot of Japanese pear caused by  Alternaria kikuchiana and gray mold diseases caused by Botrytis cinerea  Isono et al. 1965 .  Validamycin A produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus limoneus was effective in controlling rice sheath var. blight caused by Rhizoctonia solani  Iwasa et al. 1970 . Validamycin A was found to be a pro-drug, which is converted within the fungal cell to validoxylamine A, an extremely strong inhibitor of trehalase. This mode of action gives validamycin A a favorable biological selectivity, because the hydrolysis of the disaccharide trehalose does not occur in the vertebrates. The structural elucidation and total synthesis of validamycin A were achieved by Ogawa and coworkers  Suami et al. 1980 .  Mildiomycin is an aminoacylated nucleoside produced by Streptomyces rimofaciens  Harada and Kishi 1978 . It was discovered by the method established to assay the control efﬁcacy of antifungal agents against powdery mildew. Mildiomycin has been known to act as an inhibitor of the fungal protein biosynthesis. Its low toxicity on vertebrates allows it to be an environmentally favorable crop protection agent.  3 MICROBIAL METABOLITES AS  ANTIFUNGAL LEADS  The merits of natural products as fungicides can be a disadvantage in some respects. Their speciﬁc activity often resulted in a narrow antifungal spectrum with a limited application and the development of resistance strains under high selection pressure. Their biodegradability can also make them fragile, which results in short residual activity under harsh ﬁeld conditions. These might be the reasons why the microbial metabolites used as commercial fungicide per se still commands less than 1% of total fungicide market  Tanaka and O¯ mura 1993 . Recently, a breakthrough in biofungicide research came from the semisynthetic approach using microbial metabolites as lead compounds. In particular, a far more promising and effective strategy for the development of new biofungicides is to use knowledge of the structure of antifungal compounds as the starting point for the synthesis of the compounds with optimized physical, biological, and environmental properties. The activity of natural products can in principle be improved by chemical modiﬁcation. However, this approach relies heavily on the ready availability of sufﬁcient quantities of the natural starting materials and the development of appropriate synthetic methodology. The biofungicides that were devel- oped in this way are fenpiclonil and ﬂudioxonil  Nyfeler and Ackermann 1992  and synthetic derivatives of antibiotic strobilurins such as b-methoxyacrylate azoxystrobin and kresoxim-methyl  Anke et al. 1977; Godfrey 1994 . Such a derivative synthesized from microbial metabolites not only enhanced control efﬁcacy but also improved properties such as photochemical stability, low cytotoxicity, and phyto- toxicity. These successes encouraged the fungicide  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   researchers to search versatile lead compounds from diverse microbial sources with novel mode of action.  3.1 Recent Success in Fungicide Development  from Antifungal Leads  Since strobilurin A and oudemansin A were found to be fungicidal metabolites in Basidiomycete fungi Strobilurus tenacellus  Anke et al. 1977  and Oudemansiella mucida  Musilek et al. 1969 , respectively, a number of structurally related compounds were reported to have fungicidal activity. this family incorporates a methyl Each member of b-methoxyacrylate group linked at its a-position to a phenylpentadienyl unit, and all the compounds except strobilurin A carry either one or two additional substituents on the benzene ring that render structural complexity  Figure 1 . Their mode of action on mitochondrial respiration, binding at a speciﬁc site on cytochrome b, is not shared by any other known class of fungicides  Sauter et al. 1995 . The unique mode of action may not provide a chance of cross- resistance between b-methoxylacrylates and other fungicides. Although strobilurin A has excellent in vitro activity against a range of fungi, it did not show any useful in vivo activity in the greenhouse. This was due to its photochemical instability and relatively high vapor pressure, which cause it to disappear rapidly from a leaf surface. Through a series of synthetic program to solve these problems, azoxystrobin  Godwin et al. 1992  and kresoxim-methyl  Ammermann et al. 1992  were  Figure 1 Chemical structures of biofungicides in practical use and their lead compounds.  developed as commercial fungicides that overcame the problems of the lead compounds  Clough et al. 1995 . Azoxystrobin has a methyl b-methoxyacrylate toxophore, like strobilurin A, whereas kresoxim-methyl has a methyl methoxyiminoacetamide structure  Figure 1 . Axoxystrobin has a wide antifungal spectrum against all four taxonomic groups of fungi and strong preventative activity, including inhibition of fungal germination  Heaney and Knight 1994 . Kresoxim-methyl is also a broad-spectrum fungicide with strong antifungal activity against powdery mildew and apple scab  Brunelli et al. 1996 . Considering its novel mode of action and amenability for synthetic approach, strobilurins are expected to be a major fungicide in near future.  Pyrrolnitrin is another example of a microbial metabolite used as a lead compound. Pyrrolnitrin, a secondary metabolite of Pseudomonas pyrrocinia, which has a very simple structure, is thought to play a signiﬁcant role in biocontrol activity of the bacterium  Arima et al. 1964 . Although it in vitro and in vivo activity in the showed excellent greenhouse against B. cinerea and M. grisea, the disease- control efﬁcacy in the ﬁelds was poor, because it rapidly decomposed when exposed to sunlight. In the extensive synthetic programs using pyrrolnitrin as a template, feniclonil  Nevill et al. 1988  and ﬂudioxonil  Gehmann et al. 1990  were developed as seed-dressing agents against numerous fungal pathogens. The replacement of the chloro substituent in the 3-position of the pyrrole by a cyano group led to a remarkable enhancement in stability  Figure 1 . Its biological activity also was optimized by appropriate substitution on the phenyl ring. Their improved photostability over pyrrolnitrin conferred the possibility as a foliar fungicide active against B. cinerea, Monilinia spp. and Sclerotinia spp.  Nyfeler and Ackermann 1992 .  3.2 Screening of Potential Leads from Diverse  Microbial Sources  3.2.1 Streptomyces, the Largest Reservoir of  Diverse Chemical Structures  Actinomycetes have been a major supplier of natural products  Huck et al. 1991; Lee and Hwang 2003 . In particular, Streptomyces is a proliﬁc producer of versatile structures of antibiotics. Most of antibiotics developed for agricultural uses including pesticides were isolated from Streptomyces strains  Tanaka and O¯ mura 1993 . Among antifungal antibiotics recently discovered from Streptomyces spp., polyketide- spiroketal spirofungins, macrolide cineromycins, and oligo- mycin A, antimycin type kitamycins, aﬂatoxin inhibitor aﬂastatins, aminoacetophenone family heptaene antibiotics, and novel nikkomycin analogs were found to have potent antifungal activity  Bormann et al. 1999; Hayashi and Nozaki 1999; Holtzel et al. 1998; Kim et al. 1999b; Ono et al. 1998; Schiewe and Zeeck 1999; Vertesy et al. 1998 .  Streptomyces have the ability to synthesize diverse compounds covering the chemical structures generated by  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   the eukaryotic organisms such as fungi, algae, and plants. Streptomyces kurssanovii was found to have the ability to synthesize fumaramidmycin, which is structurally very similar to fumarimid and coniothriomycin produced by the fungi Sordaria sp. and Conithyrium sp.  Maruyama et al. 1975 . Although the frequency of rediscovery of known compounds is relatively high, it should also be noted that Streptomyces strains continue to provide a larger number and wider variety of new antibiotics than any other microbial sources  Okami and Hotta 1988 . Many macrolide antibiotics, for example, have already been introduced from a variety of Streptomyces spp., however, new macrolide compounds are still being discovered to be potent antifungal agents. Faeriefungin, a polyene type macrolide, isolated from S. griseus showed strong in vivo activity against asparagus  Asparagus ofﬁcinalis L.  pathogens Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium moniliforme  Smith et al. 1990 . More recently, the antifungal substances, phenylacetic acid and sodium phenylacetate, active against Phytophthora capsici and M. grisea were isolated from the culture ﬁltrates of S. humidus  Hwang et al. 2001 .  Streptomyces is a sole microbial source for a certain type of antibiotics such as members of manumycin type that contain a multifunctional mC7N unit as a central structural element. A manumycin type antibiotic SW-B has recently been puriﬁed from the culture of Streptomyces ﬂaveus strain A11  Hwang et al. 1996 . The strain was isolated from cave soil in Korea by an extensive screening program for the Streptomyces strain antagonistic to P. capsici. The structure of manumycin SW-B was determined to be 2,4,6-trimethyl deca- 2E,4E -dienamide  molecular formular C13H23NO  with the molecular weight of 209.178  Figure 2 . SW-B showed a high level of inhibitory activity and broad antifungal spectrum against several plant pathogenic oomycete and fungi such as P. capsici, M. grisea, Colletotrichum cucumerinum, and Alternaria mali. Hyphal growth of P. capsici and M. grisea was inhibited by more than 21. The simplicity 50% at 10 mg ml of the chemical structure and its broad antifungal spectrum provide the possibility as a lead compound for fungicide development.  21 and by 90% at 50 mg ml  3.2.2 Rare Actinomycetes, New Resource of  Microbial Metabolites  Since rare actinomycetes have the properties such as slow growth, poor sporulation, and instability in preservation, it seems difﬁcult to isolate them without applying the selective isolation methods. Most of their metabolites, therefore, were not subjected to the antifungal screening. However, although the antifungal agents from these non-Streptomyces groups of actinomycetes have not yet been developed into commercial fungicides, they are expected to be useful microbial sources for diversifying chemical library of metabolites.  The genus Micromonospora, only a minor component in the actinomycete population in soil, has been recognized as one of the important sources for antimicrobial metabolites.  Figure 2 Potential antifungal leads from microbial sources.  Micromonospora spp. was known to be distributed widely in soils of various geographical regions  Vobis 1991 . Since gentamicin, an aminoglycoside antibacterial antibiotic, was isolated from M. purpurea and M. echinospora  Weinstein et al. 1964 , Micromonospora spp. has been shown to produce diverse antibiotic substances such as aminoglycosides and In a screening program for macrolides  Betina 1994 . antifungal antibiotics useful for plant disease control, Micromonospora coerulea strain Ao58 was isolated from sea-mud soils, which showed strong antifungal activity against P. capsici, M. grisea, C. gloeosporioides, and R. solani  Kim et al. 1998; Kim et al. 1999a . From the culture extracts, the antibiotic streptimidone  Figure 2  was puriﬁed using various chromatographic procedures. Streptimidone was known as an inhibitor of the protein synthesis on yeast, but little has been known about its efﬁcacy as an antifungal agent against ﬁlamentous fungi. In the tests for antifungal spectrum, remarkable antifungal activities were observed against some plant pathogenic fungi P. capsici, M. grisea, Didymella bryoniae, and B. cinerea. In vivo tests showed its potent control efﬁcacy against phytophthora blight on pepper plants, gray mold on cucumber leaves, and leaf blast on rice leaves. The compound effectively inhibited the development of these plant diseases on their host plants at the concentration of  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   21. Recently,  21, at which the commercial fungicides showed 100 mg ml similar control efﬁcacy against the diseases. No phytotoxicity was observed on any of the host plants at the concentrations of 500 mg ml  two structurally related compounds isolated from rare actinomycetes were found to have potent antifungal activity against plant pathogenic fungi. Daunomycin and spartamycins were isolated from Actinomadura roseola and Micromonospora spartanea, respectively  Kim et al. 2000b; Nair et al. 1992 . Both compounds have similar anthracycline aglycone moiety attached to one or three glycosides  Figure 2 . Daunomycin noted for anticancer activity showed substantial in vitro antimicrobial activity against P. capsici, R. solani, B. cinerea, Cladosporium cucumerinum, Cylindrocarpon destructans, D. bryoniae, S. cerevisiae, and Gram positive bacteria. In particular, daunomycin showed strong inhibitory effect on the mycelial growth of P. capsici and Phytophthora development on pepper plants. In vivo efﬁciency against Phytophthora infection in pepper plants was somewhat less effective than that of the commercial fungicide metalaxyl.  Spartamycins produced by M. spartanea were isolated from a potted soil with A. ofﬁcinalis L. plants  Nair et al. 1992 . Between the two spartamycin analogs A and B, the latter showed better antimicrobial activity against several microorganisms. The minimum inhibitory concentration  MIC  of spartamycin B on Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Cryptococcus, Rhodotorula, and Candida albicans ranged 21. However, spartamycin B was not from 0.2 to 1 mg ml effective against the Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Citrobacter spp. In view of antifungal activity and structural similarity of the anthracycline antibiotics, their analogs having different glycoside moieties may be worth- while to examine their antifungal activity against various plant pathogenic fungi.  3.2.3 Other Microorganisms  Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain B5 was isolated from pepper- growing soils in Korea, which showed substantial inhibitory activity against P. capsici and other plant pathogenic fungi. From the culture broth of the antagonistic bacterial strain B5, one of the antibiotic substances active against P. capsici was puriﬁed and identiﬁed as a glycolipid antibiotic rhamnolipid B  Kim and Hwang 1993 . Rhamnolipids containing rhamnose and b-hydroxy-decanoic acid were ﬁrst found in Pseudomonas pyocyanea  the old name of P. aeruginosa   Bergstro¨m et al. 1946 . Recently, complete nuclear magnetic resonance signal assignments of rhamnolipid B based on intensive spectral analysis provided the evidence of  1,2-linkage of 3-[3-[-L-rhamnopyranosyl- 1 ! 2 -a-L-  rhamnopyranosyloxy] -decanoyloxy]-decanoic acid  Moon et al. 1996 . The glycolipid antibiotic rhamnolipid B has the characteristic structure of biosurfactants, which is comprised of a hydrophilic portion  rhamnose moiety  and a hydrophobic portion  b-hydroxydecanoate moiety . The biosurfactant property was the  supposed to render   Kim et al. 2000a .  rhamnolipid the ability to intercalate into and to disrupt the zoospore plasma membrane, because zoospores are surrounded only by plasma membrane without typical cell wall  Stanghellini and Miller 1997 . This hypothesis is well supported by the further ﬁnding that rhamnolipid B had no lytic activity on zoospore cysts surrounded with In vitro growth the cell wall inhibition assay performed in the microtiter dishes showed potent antifungal activities against Cercospora kikuchi, C. destructans, C. cucumerinum, Colletotrichum orbiculare, M. grisea, and P. capsici. In particular, rhamnolipid B had a 21 of MIC  against high level of antifungal activity  10 mg ml P. capsici. In the microscopic study, most of the zoospores 21 of became non-motile in the presence of 25 mg ml rhamnolipid B, subsequently lyzing within 1 min after treatment. Rhamnolipid B also was effective in inhibiting the germination of zoospore and the hyphal growth of P. capsici. The average hyphal length of germlings at the 21 was reduced by 55% of that in the untreated 50 mg ml control. These results suggest that rhamnolipid B has not only the lytic effect on zoospores of P. capsici but also inhibitory effect on the growth of the oomycete. Zoospores have been implicated in the spread of the oomycete pathogen through irrigation water and rainwater  Hwang and Kim 1995b; Ristaino et al. 1993 . The lytic effect of rhamnolipid B on zoospores may provide a merit as a preventive control agent against phytophthora blight in pepper-growing ﬁelds, which eliminate and or reduce zoospore density and long-distance dispersal of the pathogen. In the recirculating hydroponic cultural rhamnolipid B has been demonstrated to be very effective in controlling the dispersal of plant diseases caused by zoosporic oomycete pathogens  Stanghellini et al. 1996 .  system of crops,  Bacillus subtilis is known to produce diverse antifungal peptides represented by inturins. A series of fungicidal metabolites, named rhizocticines, were identiﬁed from B. subtilis ATCC6633  Figure 2   Fredenhagen et al. 1995 . These peptides showed control efﬁcacy against B. cinerea on apples and vines in the greenhouse. The proteolytic digestion test of the compound revealed that L-2-amino-5-phosphono- 3- Z -pentenoic acid was the actual structure active against B. cinerea. The antifungal activity was proven to be stereo speciﬁc, since the corresponding 3- E  compound did not show any antifungal activity. The mixture of rhizocticines A, B, and D also showed control efﬁcacy against gray molds on grapes in the ﬁeld.  4 POTENTIAL TARGETS FOR DISCOVERY  OF ANTIFUNGAL LEADS  Unlike the arena of development of antibacterial agents, in relative terms, where bacterial speciﬁc targets are abundant, it seems difﬁcult to develop antifungal agents with a speciﬁc mode of action. Since, fungi as eukaryotic organism, have metabolism similar to those of mammal and plant hosts, most  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   of antifungal agents discovered to be potentially active against plant pathogenic fungi have failed to survive during the testing process for practical usage. The following discussions will be of potential antifungal leads directed to fungal speciﬁc targets, with the examples of antifungal agents recently developed for clinical and agricultural uses.  4.1 Cell-Wall Biosynthesis  the fungal cell wall  Fungal cell wall is a crucial target for antifungal agents. Enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of fungal cell wall include chitin and glucan synthases  Douglas et al. 1997; Georgopapadakou 1997 . Antifungal agent echinocandins have been discovered as inhibitors of fungal cell wall biosynthesis  Denning 1997 . They are noncompetitive inhibitors of b-1,3-glucan synthase, an enzyme complex in the cell wall of many pathogenic fungi. b-1,3-Glucan synthase is a fungal speciﬁc enzyme that polymerizes UDP-glucose into b-1,3-glucan polymers that comprise the major scaffolding of  Kang and Cabib1986 . Echinocandins and its synthetic analog contain- ing the fatty acid side chain, cilofungin, exhibited comparable fungicidal activity with a narrow antifungal spectrum  Fromtling 1994 . Recently, marked improvements in antifungal activity against clinical pathogens have been achieved by synthetic variations made in the lipid side chains of echinocandins. LY30336 and caspofungin are the examples of recently developed echinocandin analogs  Espinel-Ingroff 1998 , which are generally more active in vitro against a variety of yeast and ﬁlamentous fungi. They are licensed by Lilly and Merck, respectively, for clinical usage. Such a novel mechanism of action, antifungal potency and relatively broad-spectrum activity of echinocandins provide the possibility that the inhibitors of b-1,3-glucan synthase may be available for the development of biofungicides effective against fungal diseases  Pfaller et al. 1998 .  Chitin, b-1,4-N-acetylglucosamine polymer, plays a major structural and strengthening role in fungal cell walls. Chitin is microﬁbrills consisting of hydrogen-bonded polysaccharide chains that may be covalently cross-linked to other polysaccharide, mainly glucan. It has been demonstrated that chitin synthase inhibitors and chitinase showed antifungal activity when applied to growing cells  Lorito et al. 1993 . Nikkomycins are analogs of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine produced by Streptomyces spp. They have potent activity against chitin synthase by acting as speciﬁc competitive inhibitors  Hunter 1995 . The potency of an inhibitor of chitinase synthase may depend on not only the isoform’s relative effectiveness in building a cell wall, but also its afﬁnity to a given enzyme. Recent research on chitin synthase revealed that the multiple chitin synthase genes of fungi have different sensitivities to the inhibitors  Munro and Gow 1995 . Therefore, new antifungal compounds with higher activity and speciﬁcity to chitin synthase may be generated from diverse chemical pool of microbial metabolites.  4.2 Sterol Biosynthesis  The biosynthesis of sterols is an essential metabolism that produce essential constituents of cellular membranes. Most of fungi contain ergosterol as a predominant sterol  Mercer 1991 . Recent advances in our understanding of mode of action of sterol biosynthesis inhibitors  SBI  launched a novel approach to ﬁnding inhibitors of sterol biosynthesis, which could lead to new agricultural fungicides  Barrett-Bee and Ryder 1992 . The antifungal effects of SBI have brought out a great commercial success in the synthetic fungicide market. The SBI fungicides covering about the half of the market is now practically applied to protect fruits, vegetables, and vines from plant diseases. The major SBI are the inhibitors of 14-demethylation which correspond to many antifungal compounds, referred to as azole compounds, with a wide spectrum of intrinsic activity against ascomycete, basidio- mycete and deuteromycete pathogens  Aoki et al. 1993 .  the structure of  The discovery of restricticins and lanomycin led to the introduction of a new target for screening of the antifungal natural products. The two structurally related compounds were ﬁrst isolated from the cultures of Penicillium restrictum  Schwartz et al. 1991  and Pycnidiophora dispersa  O’Sullivan et al. 1992 , respectively  Figure 2 . Both restricticin and lanomycin showed potent antifungal activity through inhibition of lanosterol C14-demethylase, one of the main steps in ergosterol biosynthesis. It is interesting to note that restricticin does not have a  phenylethyl triazole moiety found in all azole antifungal agents in the market, possibly causing adverse impacts in efﬁcacy and resistance  Tuite 1996 . However, restricticin needed to be improved in its chemical stability, because the compound was found to be unstable due to the lability of the glycin ester side chain toward base-mediated hydrolysis and the tendency of the triene functionality to undergo decomposition  Barrett-Bee and Ryder 1992 . Along with the advances in the screening for inhibitors of other steps in sterol biosynthesis, more SBI sufﬁcient for practical uses may be discovered from microbial metabolites.  4.3 Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase  ACC   Discovery of soraphen A from myxobacteria was an important event in antifungal metabolite development, because of not only enlarging microbial diversity as a source of antifungal compounds but also introducing fungal ACC as a novel target for antifungal agent screening  Gerth et al. 1994 . Acetyl-CoA carboxylase catalyzes carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA at the expense of ATP. While the functional units of ACC are usually separate proteins in prokaryotes, they form a multifunctional enzyme complex in eukaryotes. This may be the reason why soraphen A is inactive to bacteria. Soraphen A which is mainly responsible for antifungal activity of Sorangium cellulosum strain Soce26 effectively controlled powdery mildew  Erysiphe graminnis  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   f. sp. hordei  in barley, snow mold  Gerlachia nivalis  in rye, apple scab  Venturia inaequalis  on apple and gray mold  B. cinerea  on grape  Reichenbach and Ho¨ﬂe 1995 . Soraphen A has no effect on ACC of plants, thus inducing no phytotoxicity in the ﬁeld  Vahlensieck et al. 1994 . In contrast, ACC from rat liver was strongly inhibited by the soraphen  Pridzun et al. 1995 . Due to the risky side effects on experimental animals, soraphen A has not been practically used for control of plant diseases. However, the results of soraphen research strongly suggest that fungal ACC could be a target site for antifungal agent screening. Considering the numerous diversity of natural products related to the speciﬁcity of ACC, novel biofungicides from microbial metabolites that block speciﬁcally the activity of fungal ACC may be developed in the future.  4.4 Nucleic Acid Metabolism  0  One of the areas that can be exploited as antifungal targets is nucleic acid metabolism. The synthesis of nucleic acids involves numerous biochemical reactions ranging from the initial synthesis of purine and pyrimidine precursors to the ﬁnal polymerization of ribonucleoside and deoxyribonucleo- -triphosphates into RNA and DNA. A large number of side 5 compounds have been known to be inhibitors of nucleic acid metabolism in fungi. However, few of these compounds have been used as agricultural and clinical antifungal agents. Recently, antibiotic tubercidin produced by Streptomyces violaceoniger was discovered to have antifungal activity against plant pathogenic fungi  Hwang and Kim 1995a; Hwang et al. 1994 . It was highly active against P. capsici, Botryosphaeria dothidea, and R. solani. Tubercidin is an adenosine analog that interferes nucleic acid synthesis including de novo purine synthesis, rRNA processing, and tRNA methylation  Suhadolnik 1979 . The potent in vivo activity of tubercidin against P. capsici was compared with that of systemic fungicide, metalaxyl, which is one of the best-studied acylalanine targeting on the synthesis of ribosomal RNA. Treatment with tubercidin on day 1 before inoculation of zoospores prevented phytophthora blight at 21. Tubercidin was effective as much as metalaxyl, 500 mg ml irrespective of application time and concentrations, although its antifungal activity did not persist as long as metalaxyl in pepper plants. The potent antifungal activity of tubercidin against P. capsici suggests that possible targets for the antifungal agent screening may be present in nucleic acid metabolic pathway.  4.5 Protein Biosynthesis  Protein biosynthesis is available as a set of molecular targets for antibacterial agent development. The antibiotics such as chloramphenicol and streptomycin have been demonstrated to inactivate or alter the accuracy of the bacterial ribosome  Cundliffe 1990 . However, fungal protein  the use of  identity of  the components of  biosynthesis as an antifungal target has been more challenging, because of the high degree of structural and functional the protein biosynthetic machinery between fungi and higher eukaryotes. As in the cases of cycloheximide, trichodermin, and hygromycin B, their activities on the fungal ribosome appear to be identical to those on the mammalian ribosome  Tuite et al. 1995 . It was, therefore, of considerable interest to ﬁnd out a speciﬁc antifungal agent targeting on fungal protein biosynthesis.  Sordarins were found to have highly speciﬁc inhibitory activity against the elongation factor 2 involved in the translation of several fungal species  Justice et al. 1998 . Sordarins were originally isolated from the terrestrial ascomycete Sordaria araneosa  Hauser and Sigg 1971 . The fungal speciﬁc activity of sordarins is quite interesting, because the elongation factor 2 is a highly conserved protein. Recently, a mutant strain analysis revealed that sordarins had additional interactions with the ribosome itself  Justice et al. 1999 , indicating that the selectivity of these compounds was governed by multiple points of interaction between the compound and the ribosome. Using a high throughput screening  HTS  targeting on protein synthesis in Candida spp., an analog of sordarin has recently been demonstrated to be an effective in vitro inhibitor with apparent selectivity for fungal protein synthesis  Kinsman et al. 1998 .  5 FUTURE TRENDS IN BIOFUNGICIDE  RESEARCH  During the last two decades, there were numerous efforts focusing on the isolation and identiﬁcation of a wide range of biologically active natural products. As a result, hundreds of thousands to millions of compounds became available for the evaluation of their value as potential lead compounds. The concept of a HTS was developed to screen a large number of chemical libraries, which overcome the limitation of conventional in vitro and in vivo assay. The HTS is made possible by the advance in assay system, which was designed to target a speciﬁc biochemical event in fungal metabolism. A direct measure of the activity of the compound at the target of interest can be done without complications arising from other metabolic events. These approaches can enhance the possibility to discover new and useful biofungicides by supplying unique bioassay system. This innovative procedure was already applied in developing new fungicides such as sordarins mentioned earlier. The target-directed screening will be fortiﬁed by DNA sequence information that is exponentially increased in recent years by a number of fungal genome projects. The genomic information can provide a wealth of new targets to be validated and screened for new antifungal leads  DiDomenico 1999 .  Along with the innovations in screening systems,  the efforts to diversify the chemical library of microbial metabolites has been continued through combinatorial  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   approaches. Recently, the ability to synthesize a large number of chemical libraries from core structure of antibiotics was greatly enhanced by the advance of rapid combinatorial  parallel synthesis method  Caporale 1995 . The diversity and numbers of distinct compounds in combinatorial library enhance the possibility of ﬁnding a chemical structure with the desired properties. Combinatorial libraries can be synthesized in many different ways as reviewed by Dolle  1999 . However, most of the successes in combinatorial chemistry have been accomplished by using small libraries to improve the properties of a speciﬁc toxophore. The successful optimization of azole and oxazolidinone lead compounds suggested a promising future of combinatorial chemistry in biofungicide research  Trias 2001 .  As another approach to diversify the chemical library of microbial metabolites, combinatorial biosynthesis was proposed to generate “unnatural” natural products, which use genetic information and DNA recombination techniques to alter the biosynthetic pathway of the microorganism to produce the designed chemical structure. This can also be done by introducing hybrid enzyme or and swapping with heterologous biosynthetic machinery involved in the synthesis of other antibiotics  Cropp et al. 2002; Reynolds 1998 . More recently, previously unknown chemical struc- tures were generated by interchanging enzyme subunits or making hybrid enzymes of type I polyketide synthases  PKSs   Kim et al. 2002; McDaniel et al. 1999; Yoon et al. 2002 . Most of the combinatorial biosynthesis researches have been done on PKSs, especially in Streptomyces. Recently, the biosynthetic gene clusters of antifungal antibiotic pyoluteorin and 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol also were identiﬁed from plant-associated pseudomonads, the well-known biological control agents  Bender et al. 1999 . These biosynthetic gene clusters are expected to be used for the template of combinatorial biosynthesis for biofungicide development, although a number of questions about their enzymological functions still remains to be elucidated.  6 CONCLUSIONS  As the environmental and commercial requirements for new fungicides become more demanding, the merits of biofungi- cides over synthetic fungicides become more important than ever. Recently, a breakthrough in biofungicide research was made by semisynthetic approaches using antifungal microbial metabolite as the starting point. As seen in the examples of fenpiclonil, ﬂudioxonil and synthetic derivatives of antibiotic strobilurins such as b-methoxyacrylate azoxystrobin and kresoxim-methyl, this approach is a promising and effective strategy for the development of new biofungicides with desired chemical and biological characteristics. These successes encourage fungicide researchers to construct versatile chemical library of microbial metabolites that can be used for development of new fungicides. Recently, a number of antifungal compounds have been discovered from diverse microbial sources including Streptomyces, rare  actinomycetes, other eubacteria and fungi, which may be available for antifungal leads. The advances in the screening system directed to fungal speciﬁc targets have rendered more chances to get success in biofungicide development. A number of useful targets have been discovered from the fungal metabolism related to nucleic acid, protein, sterol, and cell-wall biosynthesis. The recent successful example of sordarin analogs show that better understanding of biochemi- cal events in fungal cells would uncover more useful targets for leads. Combinatorial approaches in chemical and biochemical synthesis were library of microbial suggested to diversify the chemical metabolites, which can make it easier the optimized antifungal compound with desired physical and biological properties. These new trends in developing novel biofungicides will be more facilitated and strengthened by innovative multidisciplinary approaches in the future.  the screening of antifungal  to discover  REFERENCES  Ammermann E, Lorenz G, Schelberger K, Wenderoth B, Sauter H, and Rentzea C  1992 .

Kubicek Institute of Chemical Engineering, Vienna, Austria  1  INTRODUCTION  2 TRICHODERMA BIOCONTROL TAXA  AND STRAINS  Plant diseases, caused primarily by fungal and bacterial pathogens, produce severe losses to agricultural and horticultural crops every year. These losses can result in reduced food supplies, poorer quality agricultural products, economic hardship for growers and processors, and, ultimately, higher prices. For many diseases, traditional chemical control methods are not always economical nor are they effective, and fumigation as well as other chemical control methods may have unwanted health, safety, and environmental risks. Biological control involves the use of beneﬁcial microorganisms to attack and control plant pathogens and the diseases they cause. It offers an environmentally friendly approach to the management of plant disease and can be integrated into an effective integrated disease management system. Thus, biological control can be an important component in the development of a more sustainable agriculture.  it  the actuality of  Trichoderma species have been investigated as bio- logical control agents for over 70 years, but is only relatively recently that strains have become commercially available. The previous considerations have stimulated researchers to gain a better knowledge of biocontrol by this fungus, and to understand their mechanisms of control. In view of there are numerous recent articles available which review the current state of knowledge of Trichoderma biocontrol  Chet et al. 1998; Harman and Bjo¨rkman 1998; Hjeljord and Tronsmo 1998; Monte 2001 see also the atricle by A. Herrera- Estrella and I. Chet, this volume . In this article, the current state of biological knowledge on Trichoderma strains capable of biocontrol on a molecular level will be summarized.  this research ﬁeld,  The genus Trichoderma currently consists of more than 40 known taxa, which are usually cosmopolitan,  although some species display a geographic bias: Kubicek et al. 2002; Kullnig et al. 2000 , and typically soilborne or wood decaying Teleomorphs of Trichoderma occur in the genera Hypocrea, Podostroma, and Sarawakus of the Hypocreaceae  Gams and Bissett 1998; Rossman et al. 1999 . The latter two genera likely being synonyms of Hypocrea thereby most  GJ Samuels, personal communication . Rossman  1999  proposed that necrotrophy  on basidiomycetes  is the original habitat of these Hypocrea spp. and their lignicolous properties have developed later when the species were following their hosts into their habitat  wood and decaying wood in soil . Rossman et al.  1999  claim that the Hypocrea spp., which are found on decaying wood, actually are necrotrophic on the fungi in the wood. Several of the individual teleomorphic and anamorphic partners have been detected recently, and examples relevant to biocontrol are given in Table 1. The more than 100 species of Hypocrea with Trichoderma anamorphs which Doi and Doi  1986  described constitute unexplored source of potential biocontrol agents.  Most of the isolates of the genus Trichoderma, which have been found to act as biocontrol agents, have been classiﬁed as T. harzianum Rifai, leading to the fact that T. harzianum is generally synonymized as a “biocontrol agent.” However, most of the Trichoderma strains used for biocontrol were identiﬁed at the species level exclusively on the basis of morphological and phenotypical characters, showing high convergence in many cases  Kullnig-Gradinger et al. 2003 . Therefore, reports of a pronounced genetic variability of T. harzianum isolates by analyzing carbon  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

On the basis of a rigorous comparison of a pool of seventeen bonaﬁde “T. harzianum” biocontrol strains with the neo-ex type strain of T. harzianum, Hermosa et al.  2000  showed that they actually comprised of four different species i.e., T. harzianum, T. atroviride, T. longibrachiatum and T. asperellum. Consistent results were also reported by Kullnig  2001 , who by sequence analysis of the internally transcribed spacer regions of the rDNA  ITS1 and ITS2 , the small subunit of the mitochondrial DNA  mtSSUrDNA , and part of the coding region of the 42-kDa endochitinase encoding gene ech42- reassessed the species identity of eight T. harzianum isolates, which are being used by several laboratories for key investigations on the genetics, biochem- istry, and physiology of biocontrol. Thereby the strains T. harzianum CECT 2413, T-95, T-22, and T-11 were conﬁrmed as T. harzianum, “T. harzianum” ATCC 74058, IMI 206040, ATCC 36042 identiﬁed as T. atroviride, and “T. harzianum” T-203 assessed as T. asperellum. As outlined above, there may be other species capable of biocontrol as well, T. virens being the most prominent example. In addition, molecular proof for identity of other species as biocontrol agents has been presented for T. ghanense  previously T. parceramosum; Arisan-Atac et al. 2002  and T. stromaticum  Samuels et al. 2000 .  3  IN SITU MOLECULAR TOOLS FOR BIOCONTROL STRAINS  Even if the species identity is not a concern, the ability to recognize the strain which was introduced into the ﬁeld is of interest. Appropriate molecular tools have thus recently been identifying Trichoderma strains in the introduced for environment, and to follow their fate after introduction into  the soil in situ. To monitor the behavior of a given strain in the soil, Bae and Knudsen  2001  cotransformed T. harzianum with genes encoding green ﬂuorescent protein  GFP , beta-glucuronidase  GUS , and hygromycin B resistance  hygB . One of the resulting strains was formed into calcium alginate pellets and placed onto buried glass slides in a nonsterile soil, and its ability to grow, sporulate, and colonize sclerotia of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum was compared with that of the wild-type strain. The green color of cotransformant hyphae was clearly visible with a UV epiﬂuorescence microscope, while indigenous fungi in the same samples were barely visible. Green-ﬂuorescing conidiophores and conidia were observed within the ﬁrst 3 days of incubation in soil, and this was followed by the formation of terminal and intercalary chlamydospores and subsequent disintegration of older hyphal segments. In addition, no signiﬁcant differences were detected in colonization levels between wild-type and cotransformant strains; and the authors concluded that GFP proved a most useful tool for nondestructive monitoring of the hyphal growth of the transformant in a natural soil. Also, the chromogenic substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D- glucuronic acid  X-Gluc  could be used to monitor the activity of b-glucuronidase in soil. Thus, cotransformation with GFP and GUS can provide a valuable tool for the detection and monitoring of speciﬁc strains of T. harzianum released into the soil.  As the biological strains of Trichoderma are difﬁcult to distinguish from the indigenous strains of Trichoderma found in the ﬁeld, Hermosa et al.  2001  developed a method to monitor these strains when applied to natural pathosystems. To this end they used random ampliﬁed polymorphic to estimate genetic variation DNA  RAPD  markers the species T. asperellum, among sixteen strains of T. and T. the respective RAPD products generated were used to design speciﬁc primers. Diagnostic PCR performed using these primers speciﬁcally identiﬁed one of their strains  T. atroviride 11 , and clearly distinguished this strain from other closely related Tricho- derma isolates, showing that SCAR  sequence-characterised ampliﬁed region  markers can be successfully used for identiﬁcation purposes.  atroviride, T. longibrachiatum. Analysis of  harzianum, T.  inhamatum,  An alternative approach, suitable to monitor the presence of several strains in one sample was presented by van Elsas et al.  2000  by selecting a nested PCR approach, in which the ﬁrst PCR provided the required speciﬁcity for fungi, whereas the second  nested  PCR served to produce amplicons separable on denaturing gradient gels. Denatur- ing gradient gel electrophoresis  DGGE  allowed the resolution of mixtures of PCR products of several different including Trichoderma. Although only limited fungi examples have so far been published, techniques like these and the fast current advance in PCR technology  such as real-time PCR to name only one  will stimulate further studies of the behavior of Trichoderma biocontrol agents in the ﬁeld is now possible.

This is in part due to the fact that only little is known about the genome organization and its plasticity of Trichoderma. Not even the number of chromosomes is known with certainty: Fekete et al.  1996  separated six chromosomes in ﬁve Trichoderma biocontrol strains with sizes ranging from 3.7 to 7.7 Mb; estimated genome sizes were between 30.5 and 35.8 Mb. When fractionated chromosomes of the ﬁve species were probed with a fragment of the ech42  endochitinase-encoding  gene, strong hybridization signals developed, but their physical position varied among species indicating a polymorphic chromosomal location. Herrera-Estrella et al.  1993  com- pared the molecular karyotype of T. reesei with that of T. atroviride  named erroneously T. harzianum in their study , and T. viride, and detected largely similar chromosomal organization of genes in different species, although T. viride seemed to lack the smallest chromosome. Similarly, Hayes et al.  1993 , when karyotyping three biocontrol strains of T. harzianum  one parent and two mutants derived from it , found that the smallest chromosome was not present in the mutants. While all these studies revealed a low degree of chromosome polymorphism at the karyotypes were relatively constant. A report to the contrary  Gomez et al. 1997  is probably ﬂawed by the use “T. harzianum” strains which in fact consisted of several different species  CP Kubicek, unpublished data . Thus, as expected for an asexual fungus, chromosome plasticity is unlikely responsible for the genetic instability of Trichoderma biocontrol strains.  the species level,  Molecular genetic work with Trichoderma spp. is still limited by the only rudimentary information about its genomic organization as is available for Aspergillus fumigatus  http:  www.tigr.org tdb e2k1 afu1   and Neuro- spora crassa  http:  www-genome.wi.mit.edu annotation  fungi neurospora . Genetic maps could so far not be constructed, because the teleomorphs of biocontrol species of Trichoderma  see Table 1  do not cross in axenic culture  CP Kubicek, unpublished data . Also, at the time of this writing, genome sequencing projects on selected species of Trichoderma have only just been initiated at a few places, and no results from these are yet available. However, a collection of 1151 ESTs of T. reesei grown on glucose and the sequence of the complete mitochondrial genome is already available in the Internet  http:  trichoderma.iq.usp.br TrEST.html , and can  because of the high similarity of nucleotide sequences of protein encoding genes within the genus  unpublished data  be used for picking genes from biocontrol strains as well .  Interestingly, Seiboth and Hofmann  2002  found a similar genomic organization of several genes of galactose metabolism in T. reesei and N. crassa. This ﬁnding is highly  interesting, as N. crassa has evolved about 200 million years ago  Berbee and Taylor 1993 , whereas H. jecorina evolved only about 100 million years ago  Kullnig- Gradinger et al. 2003 , and thus the genomic organization of these genes has been maintained constant for about 100 million years. Hamer et al.  2001  have also recently reported that a 53-kb region of the genome of Magnaporthe grisea was also syntenic to a corresponding portion of the Neurospora genome. In a comprehensive study on hemiascomycetous yeasts, Llorente et al.  2000  demon- strated that even phylogenetic distant species such as S. cerevisiae and Yarrowia lipolytica exhibit 10.1 % of conserved synteny. If there is indeed a high degree of synteny between Neurospora and Trichoderma, this may be useful of Trichoderma biocontrol strains.  studying the  organization  genomic  for  Probably due to reproduction,  largely via asexual mechanisms, many species of Trichoderma reveal a high level of genetic stability  cf. Kubicek et al. 2002; Kullnig et al. 2000 . T. harzianum, however, is a noteworthy exception, showing a remarkable intraspeciﬁc genetic and phenotypic variation, and this may also be related to the instability of the respective biocontrol species. The reason for this has not been explained yet. As the respective teleomorph  H. lixii  is known, the possibility of sexual recombination still needs rigorous testing. Transposons, which have been isolated from phylogenetically close fungal genera such as Tolypocladium or Fusarium, are another possibility. We have recently observed a very high noninduced mutation rate in one biocontrol strain of T. harzianum which would be compatible with the presence of a mobile element  C Gallhaup, RL Mach and CP Kubicek, unpublished .  In accordance with this situation, Meyer  As far as nonchromosomal elements are concerned, plasmids have been detected in ﬁlamentous fungi almost exclusively in the mitochondrium  Bertrand 2002 . They are generally stable genetic elements and vary between 1 – 6 kb size.  1991  detected mitochondrial plasmids in strains of T. viride and the biocontrol-relevant species T. asperellum  then named “T. viride 2” . A circular plasmid called pThr1, with a monomer size of 2.6 kb, was identiﬁed in the mitochondria of the biocontrol isolate T. harzianum T95  Antal et al. 2002 . It revealed no DNA sequence similarity with the mitochondrial genome of the isolate and contained a single 1818 bp open reading frame. The derived amino acid sequence exhibited similarity to the reverse transcriptases of the circular Mauriceville and Varkud retroplasmids of Neurospora spp. and the linear pFOXC2 and pFOXC3 retroplasmids of Fusarium oxysporum strains. In the regions of homology all of the seven conserved amino In acid blocks characteristic of RTs could be found.

All Rights Reserved.   5 MOLECULAR GENETIC BASIS OF  BIOCONTROL  Arising from nectrotrophic ancestors, most of the currently known Trichoderma strains have developed highly effective antagonistic mechanisms to survive and colonize the basidiomycete-containing competitive environment of the rhizosphere, soil, and decaying wood. Active parasitism on host fungi, by penetration of host hyphae is probably the mechanism most studied  cf. Chet et al. 1998 ; it requires morphological changes of Trichoderma hyphae such as appressorium formation and coiling, and is further supported by the production of extracellular enzymes, and production of antifungal antibiotics. However this mechanism has mostly been observed in the laboratory, and application of Trichoderma in the ﬁeld may involve additional mechanisms as well such as aggressive degradation of organic matter, thereby competing for nutrients which in saprobic phases may be a limiting factor. Also promotion of the growth and biological activities of saprobic bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi, and of plant-growth and induced resistance have been reported  for review see Herrera-Estrella and Chet, Chapter 57 .  the fungus,  the cell wall of  Among these, mycoparasitism is the only process which has been studied on a molecular biological basis. Herrera- Estrella and Chet  Chapter 57  give a detailed account on this, and I shall therefore treat this point here only very brieﬂy: most attention has been paid to the enzymatic disruption of thereby focusing on enzymes capable of hydrolysis its structural polymers  chitin, b-glucan, protein and others . Genes encoding endochitinases, N-acetyl-b-glucosaminidases, proteases, endo- and exo-glucan b-1,3-glucosidases, endoglucan-b- 1,6-glucosidases, lipases, xylanases, amylases, phospho- lipases, RNAses, and DNAses have been cloned from various biocontrol species of Trichoderma, and are listed in detail in the above-mentioned chapter  also see Benitez et al. 1998; Kubicek et al. 2001; Lorito 1998 . Most of these enzymes showed very strong antifungal activity against a variety of plant pathogenic fungi in vitro. Several of these cell wall degrading enzymes, but most notably chitinases, have thus been demonstrated to have a great potential as active components in new fungicidal formulations or genetically modiﬁed plants.  Interestingly, the endochitinases found in Trichoderma belong only to one  class V  of the several classes of the chitinases known from plants  Beintema 1994 . The latter show a modular structure, and frequently contain protein domains capable of binding to chitin, which bear some resemblance to the cellulose-binding domains also found in Trichoderma cellulases. In contrast, none of the chitinases cloned from Trichoderma spp. so far has been shown to contain such a chitin-binding domain. To investigate the role of the latter, Limon et al.  2001  have produced hybrid chitinases with stronger chitin-binding capacity by fusing to Chit42 a ChBD from Nicotiana tabacum ChiA chitinase and  the cellulose-binding domain from cellobiohydrolase II of T. reesei. The chimeric chitinases had similar activities as the native chitinase towards soluble substrates, but higher hydrolytic activity on high molecular mass insoluble substrates  chitin or fungal cell walls . Unfortunately, no results from in vivo biocontrol tests were reported, and it remains thus unclear whether the presence of such a domain would improve the antagonistic abilities of Trichoderma biocontrol strains.  The action of chitinases and glucanases is also strongly synergistic both with other chitinase components as well as with other components putatively involved in biocontrol, i.e., antibiotics  Jach et al. 1995; Lorito et al. 1994; 1996b; Schirmbo¨ck et al. 1994 . In the case of the peptaibols, the mechanism of this enzyme – antibiotic synergism has been shown to be due to a synergistic effect of enzyme and the antibiotic on the maintenance of cell wall integrity  Lorito et al. 1996b . Peptaibols are linear oligopeptides of 12 – 22 amino acids, which are rich in a-aminoisobutyric acid, N-acetylated at the N-terminus and containing an amino alcohol  Pheol or Trpol  at the C-terminus  Rebuffat et al. 1989 , and known to form voltage-gated ion channels in black lipid membranes and modify the membrane permeability of liposomes in the absence of applied voltage  El Hadjji et al. 1989 . Hence, while the chitinases reduce the barrier effect of the cell-wall, peptaibol antibiotics inhibit the membrane bound chitin- and b-glucan synthases and thereby impair the ability of the hyphae to repair the lytic effect of the enzymes on the cell walls polymers.  The gene  tex1  encoding the enzyme synthesizing these peptaibols  peptaibol synthase  has recently been cloned from T. virens  Wiest et al. 2002 . It comprises a 62.8 kb continuous open reading frame encoding a protein structure consisting of 18 peptide synthetase modules with additional modifying domains at the N- and C-terminii. Mutation of the gene eliminated production of all peptaibol isoforms, indicating that their formation is due to a relaxed substrate speciﬁcity of the individual synthase domains. Interestingly, the nucleotide sequence of tex1 is 100% identical to a 5,056-bp partial cDNA fragment of another gene   psy1  isolated also from T. virens  Wilhite et al. 2001 . These authors observed that psy1 disruptants grew poorly under low-iron conditions, and failed to produce the major T. virens siderophore, dimerum acid  a dipeptide of acylated N a -hydroxyornithine, thus suggesting that Psy1 plays a role in siderophore production. Biocontrol activity against damping-off diseases caused by Pythium ultimum and Rhizoctonia solani was not reduced by the psy1disruption. The discrepancy between the results reported by Wiest et al.  2002 ; Wilhite et al.  2001  need to be explained before the importance of the tex1 psy1 gene in biocontrol can be estimated.  Peptaibols, however, are certainly not the only secondary metabolites with synergistic action in host cell-wall degardation. Other components  e.g., gpentyl pyrone  was also found to be important for antagonism in vivo  Claydon et al. 1987; Howell 1998; Serrano-Carreon et al. 1993 , and  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   their mechanism of action thus awaits to be elucidated. 6-pentylapyrone is probably the most frequently studied of these metabolites, as it also exhibits a pronounced “coconut- aroma” which can be used as a  for humans  nontoxic ﬂavoring agent. Its biosynthesis has been claimed to be derived from linolenic acid  Serrano-Carreon et al. 1993 , but this conclusion was criticized by Sivasithamparam and Ghisalberti  1998 , who consider it to be a product of polyketide biosynthesis. No other of the genes or proteins involved in Trichoderma secondary metabolism has as yet been characterized.  6 BIOCONTROL-SPECIFIC GENE  EXPRESSION IN TRICHODERMA  In the laboratory, high-level induction of extracellular cell- wall lytic enzymes is usually obtained by growing Trichoderma on puriﬁed chitin, fungal cell walls, or mycelia as sole carbon sources. No, or much less, induction is normally obtained when related compounds such as chitosan, cellulose, unpuriﬁed chitin, or laminarin are used. In addition, formation of most chitinolytic enzymes does not occur or is even inhibited by glucose, sucrose, and chitinolytic end- products  Carsolio et al. 1994; Garcia et al. 1994; Lorito et al. 1996a; Margolles-Clark et al. 1996; Peterbauer et al. 1996 , suggesting that direct induction and or catabolic repression are major regulatory parameters for chitinase formation. Some researchers also found trace quantities of some chitinases  e.g. the 102-kDa N-acetyl-b-D-glucosaminidase, the 42-kDa endochitinase and the 33 kDa endochitinase  are produced constitutively  Carsolio et al. 1999; Garcia et al. 1994; Haran et al. 1995; Inbar and Chet 1995; Margolles- Clark et al. 1996 . It should be noted that this does not rule out regulation of the respective promoters by induction only, due to the fact that the binding of DNA-binding proteins to their target sequences is an equilibrium, every promoter will partially be in transcriptionally active state, depending on the Kd and the concentrations of the respective proteins.  Some of these ﬁndings have recently been supported by the analysis of gene expression. The expression of T. atroviride nag1 is triggered by fungal  B. cinerea  cell walls and the commercially available chitin monomer N-acetyl-glucosamine, and the oligomers di-N-acetyl- chitobiose and tri-N-acetylchitotriose  Mach et al. 1999 . In contrast, ech42 expression in T. atroviride was also observed during growth on fungal cell walls, but could not be triggered by those chitin degradation products  Margolles-Clark et al. 1996; Corte´s et al. 1998; Mach et al. 1999 , whereas in is induced by N-acetyl-b-D-glucosamine T. harzianum it  Garcia et al. 1994; Schickler et al. 1998 . Digestion of the host cell walls with speciﬁc combinations of puriﬁed Trichoderma-secreted chitinases and glucanases  both endo- and exo-acting  released products that strongly elicited ech42 and nag1 gene expression and consequent mycoparasitic activity. Lorito  2002  recently reported the puriﬁcation of  these low-molecular weight, biocontrol-inducing molecules released from the host cell walls, and showed that they were much more active in vitro than puriﬁed chitin or glucan monomers.  The failure of T. atroviride to induce ech42 expression by chitin may be due to complex interactions within different regulatory circuits  Donzelli and Harman 2001 : both ech42 and nag1 required both nitrogen starvation and the presence of chitin for induction, whereas gluc78 could be induced by nitrogen starvation alone. In the presence of low levels of ammonium  10 mM , both chito-oligomers and chitin triggered CHIT42 and CHIT40  chitobiosidase  production. CHIT73 secretion occurred in the presence of N-acetyl- glucosamine and chito-oligomers, while chitin was less effective. These results indicate that the expression and secretion of cell wall-degrading enzymes by Trichoderma is nitrogen repressed, and that effects of carbon and nitrogen nutrition are interactive. The expression of ech42 from T. atroviride after prolonged carbon starvation is likely not due to a relieve from carbon catabolite repression, as it can be observed with glucose as well as with glycerol as a carbon In addition, ech42 gene source  Mach et al. 1999 . transcription was triggered by some conditions of physio- logical stress  48C, high osmotic pressure, addition of ethanol; Mach et al. 1999 , as well as during light-induced sporulation  Carsolio et al. 1994 . Interestingly, T. harzianum chit33 expression, while being inducible by N-acetyl-b-D-gluco- samine, was also triggered by carbon starvation, nitrogen starvation and physiological stress  de las Mercedes Dana et al. 2001 , suggesting that stress-mediated regulation may be a general phenomenon involved in chitinase gene expression of Trichoderma spp.  lectin, whereas formation of all  Some studies have so far been performed towards understanding how and in which order the chitinases are induced during mycoparasitic interaction. In their pioneering studies, Inbar and Chet  1992 ;  1995  demonstrated that formation of chitin-degrading enzymes in T. harzianum is elicited by a lectin-based physical interaction with the host, which was suggested to be the earliest event of interaction, and precede induction by possible chitooligomers  see chapter Herrera-Estrella and Chet . Inbar and Chet  1995  showed that a 102-kDa chitinase is speciﬁcally induced by contact with the host the other chitinases requires the presence of the living host. They concluded that an N-acetyl-b-D-glucosaminidase with apparent denatured Mr of 102 kDa may be responsible for the ﬁrst attack and induction for the other chitinases. However, Zeilinger et al.  1998 , using the Aequorea victoria GFP as a nondisruptive reporter system, showed that ech42, but not nag1, was formed before any detectable contact of Trichoderma with its host. Similar studies with chit33:GFP in T. harzianum  de las Mercedes Dana et al. 2001  showed that this pre-contact gene expression did not occur with the 33-kDa endochitinase-encoding gene chit33, and therefore may be speciﬁc for ech42. Interestingly, ech42 gene expression was prevented when a dialysis membrane was placed between the two fungi  Zeilinger et al. 1999 , but still  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   occurred when a cellophane membrane was used for this purpose  Corte´s et al. 1998 . This led to contradicting conclusions regarding the nature of the molecule triggering ech42 gene expression  Corte´s et al. 1998; Zeilinger et al. 1999 ; this issue was consequently solved by showing that the cellophane, but not the dialysis, membrane, was partially permeable to proteins of relatively large size  up to 100 kDa   Kullnig et al. 2000 . Thus the data from both studies  Corte´s et al. 1998; Zeilinger et al. 1999  were in perfect agreement and showed that ech42 is expressed before contact of Trichoderma with its host, probably representing one of the earliest event in mycoparasitism and biocontrol. By using two types of membranes  one permeable and one not permeable to proteins , which allowed the removal of either Trichoderma or Rhizoctonia colony from the plate and thus the performing of subsequent cultivations, Kullnig et al.  2000  also showed that a chitinase activity, secreted constitutively by Tricho- derma, the triggering of ech42 gene expression. The nature of this enzyme is still unknown; and it could very well be either  constitutive amounts of  the 42 kDa endochitinase itself or the 102 kDa protein of Inbar and Chet  1995 , or any other constitutively formed chitinase or chitinases. To this end, Brunner et al.  2002  deleted the nag1  73-kDa N-acetyl-b-D-glucosaminidase encoding  gene of T. atroviride. These strains were unable to induce ech42 gene transcription under conditions of carbon starvation or in the presence of fungal cell-walls, and also lacked the formation of other enzyme activities capable of hydrolyzing PNP-NAcGlc, PNP-NAcGlc2, and PNP-NAcGlc3. Since the 102-kDa exochitinase does not occur in T. atroviride P1  unpublished data , the 73-kDa enzyme may fulﬁl the role of the T. harzianum 102 kDa enzyme. Unfortunately, a characterization of the latter enzyme has not yet been published.  is essential  for  The obvious antifungal activity of Trichoderma chitinases has consequently lead to attempts to improve or alter biocontrol properties of strains by chitinase gene manipula- tions. Somewhat conﬂicting data have been reported on the effect of overexpression and or deletion of selected chitinase genes of Trichoderma. Carsolio et al.  1999  found no difference between an ech42- disrupted strain and its parent T. atroviride IMI 206040 in the biocontrol activity in glasshouse tests against Sclerotium rolfsii and R. solani on cotton, and therefore concluded that ech42 is not essential for biocontrol activity. In contrast, Woo et al.  1998 ; Baek et al.  1999  noted pronounced effects on the biocontrol efﬁcacy of an ech42 gene disruption mutant of T. atroviride P1 or T. virens, respectively. The latter authors reported an increased and decreased biocontrol activity against R. solani on cotton in strains of T. virens containing two ech42 copies and a disrupted ech42 gene copy. Woo et al.  1998  also observed a signiﬁcant reduction in antifungal activity for the ech42 disrupted strain and in vivo tests against B. cinerea by leaf inoculations of bean plants revealed a signiﬁcant reduction of biocontrol ability of the disruptant strain. In contrast, a signiﬁcant increase was noted for the biocontrol efﬁcacy of soils heavily infested with R. solani. Macro- and  microscopic examinations of the attached seed coats suggested that the lack of the 42-kDa endochitinase may have stimulated the colonization of the spermo- and rhizosphere.  Other cell wall hydrolases, whose effect on biocontrol has been studied, are the chitinases chit33 and nag1 and the proteinase prb1. b-Glucanases have also been tried but their overexpression appears to be counteracted by overexpression of acid proteases  Delgado-Jarana et al. 2000 . Using a constitutively expressed pki1::chit33 fusion, Limo´n et al.  1999  obtained recombinant strains with higher antagonizing activity against R. solani on agar plates. However, results from experiments with these mutants performed in glasshouse or soil have not been reported. T. harzianum transformants carrying two to ten copies of the prb1 gene signiﬁcantly reduced the disease caused by R. solani in cotton plants under greenhouse conditions  Flores et al. 1997 . Interestingly, culture ﬁltrates of a T. atroviride nag1-delta strain, despite of their inability to induce chitinase gene expression  see earlier  exhibited a moderately reduced ability  40 – 50%  to protect infections by Rhizoctonia solani and beans against S. sclerotiorum  Brunner et al. 2003 . Therefore, while nag1 is essential triggering chitinase gene expression in T. atroviride, the almost complete loss of chitinase activity only partially impairs biocontrol activity against R. solani and S. sclerotiorum. It is possible that this may be compensated by an increased formation of glucanolytic enzymes in this strain  unpublished data .  for  A more general approach towards improvement of the biocontrol properties of T. harzianum CECT 2413 was presented by Rey et al.  2001 ; they selected improved biocontrol mutants by testing for the ability to produce wider haloes on pustulan, a polymer of beta-1,6-glucan, as a carbon source. Interestingly, the mutants exhibited two- to four times more chitinase, beta-1,3- and beta-1,6-glucanase activities than the wild type, and produced about three times more extracellular proteins. This mutant performed better than the wild type during in vitro experiments, overgrowing and sporulating on R. solani earlier, killing this pathogen faster and exerting better protection on grapes against B. cinerea.  6.1 Cis and Trans-Acting Genetic Factors  Relevant to the Expression of Biocontrol Genes  Lorito et al.  1996a  ﬁrst used an in vitro approach to detect cis-acting motifs on the ch42 promoter being involved in mycoparasitism. They confronted Botrytis cinerea on agar plates with T. atroviride P1, prepared crude protein extracts from mycelia harvested at different phases during myco- parasitism, and used them in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Competition experiments, using oligonucleotides containing functional and nonfunctional consensus sites for the binding repressor Cre1 0 0 ; Kulmburg et al. 1993  provided evidence  5  -SYGGRG-3  catabolite  carbon  of  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   its  fragments used.  involve Cre1, as  that the complex from nonmycoparasitic mycelia involves the ech-42 the binding of Cre1 to both fragments of promoter. These ﬁndings are consistent with the presence of two and three consensus sites, respectively, for binding of Cre1 in the two ech-42 promoter In the protein-DNA complex from mycoparasitic contrast, mycelia does not formation is unaffected by the addition of the competing oligonucleo- tides. Based on these ﬁndings, they offered a preliminary model for regulation of ech-42 expression in T. harzianum, which subsequently involves:  a  binding of Cre1 to two single sites in the ech-42 promoter;  b  binding of a “mycoparasitic” protein protein complex to the ech-42 promoter in vicinity of the Cre1 binding sites, and  c  inactivation of Cre1 upon mycoparasitic functional interaction to enable the formation of the “mycoparasitic” protein – DNA complex  Lorito et al. 1996a . The cre1 gene from T. harzianum has been cloned  Ilmen et al. 1996 , but no demonstration of its effect on biocontrol in vivo was as yet presented.  Figure 1 Scheme illustrating the hypothesis how chitinase gene expression could be triggered in T. atroviride, based on results from Brunner et al.  2002 ; Mach et al.  1999 ; Kullnig et al.  2000 ; Peterbauer et al.  2002a,b ; Zeilinger et al.  1999 . Circled plus and minus indicate activation and inactivation of a process, respectively, without implying the underlying mechan- ism. Proteins A, B and C refer to the Zn 6  cluster protein  Peterbauer et al. 2002a , the mycoparasitic regulator  Lorito et al. 1996a  and the BrlA-box binding starvation response repressor  see text , respectively. The black triangles indicate NAcGlc molecules, and symbolize NAcGlc,  NAcGlc 2, and  NAcGlc 3, respectively.  0  Another cis-acting element was recently identiﬁed that may contribute to the regulation of ech42 gene expression: the ech42 promoter sequence contains two short nucleotide sequences which resemble the consensus for binding of the Aspergillus nidulans brlA  bristle  regulator  5 -MRAGGGR- 0 ; Chang and Timberlake 1992 . The encoded BrlA protein is 3 a general regulator of conidial development, which itself responds to carbon starvation  Skromne et al. 1995 . Cell-free extracts of T. atroviride, prepared from mycelia subjected to carbon starvation, form a speciﬁc, consensus-dependent complex with BrlA site-containing oligonucleotide fragments of the ech42 promoter  K Brunner, CK Peterbauer, and CP Kubicek, unpublished data . Deletion of the promoter areas containing the BrlA sites in vivo resulted in a derepression of the starvation induced expression of ech42, but had no effect on the expression of ech42 during sporulation. This motif therefore likely binds a new repressor of Trichoderma rather than a sporulation speciﬁc regulator.  The induction of nag1 by chitin oligomers has been studied in more detail, using a combination of promoter in vivo footprinting, and EMSA experiments, deletion, proteins binding to an AGGGG-element, to a CCAGN13- CTGG motif and to a CCAAT-box were identiﬁed  Peterbauer et al. 2002a,b . Disruption of either of the two former binding sites in vivo resulted in an almost complete reduction of induction of nag1 expression by N-acetylgluco- samine. The nature of the proteins binding to these three motifs is only partially understood: the spatial organization of the CCAGN13CTGG motif would be compatible with the binding of a Zn II 2Cys6-type zinc ﬁnger protein  Todd and Andrianopoulos 1997 , whereas the CCAAT-box binds a protein complex consisting of at least three proteins Hap2, Hap3, and Hap5, which were originally described in S. cerevisiae and more recently characterized from T. reesei  Zeilinger et al. 2001 . According to Narendja et al.  1999 ; Zeilinger et al.  2003 , their function is the establishment of an open chromatin structure at the promoter.  The AGGGG-box is a motif which has been studied in detail in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and identiﬁed as a binding site for the Cys2His2 zinc ﬁnger proteins Msn2p and Msn4p, which are key regulators of the transcription of a number of genes coding for proteins with stress-protective functions  Ruis and Schu¨ller 1995 . In Trichoderma, the occurrence of the AGGGG-box is not restricted to the nag1 promoter but also occurs in two other chitinase promoters, ech42 and chit33  Lorito et al. 1996a; de las Mercedes Dana et al. 2001 , consistent with a potential role in chitinase regulation. This would be compatible with a regulation of the expression of chitinase genes by metabolic stress, as shown both for ech42 and chit33  see earlier . However, nag1 is not upregulated by stress  CK Peterbauer, unpublished data , and the presence of this motif must therefore serve another function. In this context it is interesting to note that an AGGGG-motif was also identiﬁed in the cutinase promotor of Haematonectria haematococca, where it appeared to be involved in maintaining the basal expression level  Ka¨mper et al. 1994 . In Yarrowia lipolytica, the AGGGG motif is bound by  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   the Mhy1p protein, whose transcription is dramatically increased during the yeast-to-hypha transition  Hurtado and Rachubinski 1999 .  In order to study whether a homologue of S. cerevisiae MSN2 4 and H. haematococca AGGGG-binding protein encoded by the open reading frame AAB04132  which we  call seb1, ¼ stress element binding  has recently been  cloned from T. atroviride  Peterbauer et al. 2002a,b . Its zinc ﬁnger domain has high amino acid sequence identity with S. cerevisiae Msn2 4 and the H. haematococca AGGGG-binding protein, and speciﬁcally recognizes the AGGGG sequence of the ech42 and nag1 promoter in band shift assays. However, a cDNA clone of seb1 was unable to complement a MSN2 4 delta mutant of S. cerevisiae. Despite the presence of AGGGG elements in the promoter of the chitinase gene nag1, no differences in its expression were found between the parent and a seb1-delta-strain. The EMSA analyses with cell-free extracts of the seb1-delta still showed the presence of proteins binding to the AGGGG- element in nag1 and ech42, and thus seb1 does not encode the protein binding to this sequence in the chitinase promoters. Rather, seb1 appears to be involved in osmotic stress response: seb1-mRNA accumulation was increased under conditions of osmotic stress  sorbitol, NaCl —but not under other  cadmium sulfate, pH, membrane perturbance , and growth of the delta-seb1 strain was signiﬁcantly more inhibited by the presence of 1 M sorbitol and 1 M NaCl than that of the wild-type strain  Peterbauer et al. 2002a,b .  stress conditions  7 CONCLUSIONS  This and the accompanying review  see chapter 57  show the molecular biology of Trichoderma has made that tremendous progress during the last decade, both from a methodical as well as theoretical perspective. Gene manipulation in Trichoderma is now routine, as are more sophisticated approaches to study gene expression and its regulation. In addition, working models such as the one developed in our laboratory on the induction of chitinases during mycoparasitism  Figure 1 , can now be investigated and critically tested in more detail. Yet a drawback of the current situation is that so far mainly genes encoding extracellular enzymes have been studied, and even these mostly under the redundancy of the genes encoding extracellular enzymes such as chitinases  cf. Baek et al. 1999 , the role of the individual enzymes in vivo still needs to be critically assessed. Other factors may be more relevant in the ﬁeld such as and competition with the respective hosts.

Chet  The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel  1  INTRODUCTION  The practice of monoculture in modern agriculture enables us to continue to provide foodstuffs for the world’s ever increasing population. Monoculture is, however, an eco- logically unnatural situation, that is inherently unstable and offers considerable opportunity for the development of diseases. Plant disease control has now therefore become heavily dependent on fungicides to combat the wide variety of fungal diseases that threaten agricultural crops. Even with intensive fungicide use, the destruction of crop plants by fungal pathogens is a serious problem worldwide that annually leads to losses of about 15%  Logemann and Schell 1993 . The use of pesticides in general, has also resulted in signiﬁcant costs to public health and the environment. Studies aimed at replacing pesticides with environmentally safer methods are currently being conducted at many research centers. In this context, control of plant pests by the application of biological agents holds great promise as an alternative to the use of chemicals. It is generally recognized that biological control agents are safer and sounder environmentally than is reliance on the use of high volumes of treatments. The heightened scientiﬁc interest in biological control of plant pathogens is a response, in part, to growing public concerns over chemical pesticides. However, there is an equally greater need for biological control of pathogens that presently go uncontrolled or only partially controlled by these “traditional” means  Cook 1993 . Thus, biological control should and can be justiﬁed on its own merits, without giving it importance at the expense of chemical controls.  fungicides and other antimicrobial  Biocontrol must be effective, reliable, consistent, and economical before it becomes an important component of plant disease management. To meet these criteria, we must increase our understanding of the biology of the biocontrol agent in question, which in most cases is extremely limited. Furthermore, superior strains, together with delivery systems that enhance biocontrol activity, must be developed  Harman et al. 1989 . In this context, many biological control agents can be modiﬁed genetically to enhance their attributes. In addition, we can now think of microorganisms with inhibitory activity against plant pathogens as potential sources of genes for disease resistance.  2 TRICHODERMA AS A BIOLOGICAL  CONTROL AGENT  The potential for the use of Trichoderma species as biocontrol agents was suggested 70 years ago by Weindling  1932  who was the ﬁrst to demonstrate the parasitic activity of members of this genus towards pathogens such as Rhizoctonia solani  Chet 1990; Weindling 1932 . Since then, several species of Trichoderma have been tested as biocontrol agents; and have shown to attack a range of economically important aerial and soilborne plant pathogens  Chet 1987 . In many experiments, showing successful biological control, the antagonistic Trichoderma was found to be a necrotrophic mycoparasite  Boosalis 1964; Chet and Elad 1982; Elad et al. 1983b . Mycoparasitism is deﬁned as a direct attack on a fungal thallus, followed by nutrient utilization by the parasite  Chet et al. 1997 . Necrotrophic mycoparasites, such as  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   Trichoderma, are those that kill the host cells before, or just after, invasion and use the nutrients released. These mycoparasites tend to be highly aggressive and destructive. They have a broad host range extending to wide taxonomic groups and are relatively unspecialized in their mode of parasitism. The antagonistic activity of necrotrophs is due to the production of antibiotics, toxins, or hydrolytic enzymes in such proportions as to cause death and destruction of their host  Manocha and Sahai 1993 . In our view biocontrol by Trichoderma includes:  a  competition,  b  parasitism,  c  antibiosis, and  d  induction of defense responses in host plants, or the combination of some of them. Parasitism is a complex process including:  a  host recognition,  b  secretion of hydrolytic enzymes,  c  hyphae penetration and invasion  Figure 1 , and  d  lysis of the host.  2.1 Host Recognition  In vitro, the ﬁrst detectable interaction shows that the hyphae of the mycoparasite grow directly towards its host  Chet et al. 1981 . This phenomenon appears as a chemotropic growth of Trichoderma in response to some stimuli produced by the host  Chet and Elad 1983 . When the mycoparasite reaches the host, its hyphae often coil around it or attach to it by forming hooklike structures. Although not a frequent event production of appressoria at the tips of short branches has been observed. Coiling appears to be controlled by lectins present on the host hyphae. A R. solani lectin that binds to galactose and fucose residues was shown to agglutinate conidia of a mycoparasitic strain of Trichoderma harzianum but did not agglutinate two nonparasitic strains  Barak et al. 1985; Elad et al. 1983a .  the puriﬁed S. rolfsii  D-glucose or D-mannose residues, apparently present on the cell walls of T. harzianum, inhibited the activity of a second lectin isolated from Sclerotium rolfsii. Inbar and Chet  1992; 1994  were able to mimic the fungus – fungus interaction in vitro using nylon ﬁbers coated with either concanavalina A or lectin. During the interaction Trichoderma recognized and attached to the coated ﬁbers, coiling around them and forming other mycoparasitism- related structures, such as appresoriumlike bodies and hyphal loops  Inbar and Chet 1992; 1994 . Recently, using the biomimetic system we showed that different lectins induce coiling. Furthermore, coiling of Trichoderma around the ﬁbers in the absence of lectins can be induced by applying cAMP or the heterotrimeric G protein activator mastoparan  Rocha-Ramı´rez et al. 2002 . Transgenic lines that over- express the Ga subunit coil at higher frequency than untransformed controls. Furthermore, transgenic lines that express an activated mutant protein with no GTPase activity coil at an even higher frequency. In addition, lines that express an antisense version of the gene do not appear to coil in the biomimetic assay  Rocha-Ramı´rez et al. 2002 .  2.2 Host Invasion  It has been proposed that penetration of the host mycelium takes place by partial degradation of its cell wall  Elad et al. 1983b,c . Interaction sites have been stained by ﬂuores- ceinisothiocyanate-conjugated lectins or calcoﬂuor. The appearance of ﬂuorescence indicated the presence of localized cell wall lysis at points of interaction between the antagonist and its host  Elad et al. 1983c . Furthermore,  Figure 1 Transmission electron micrographs of Trichoderma atroviride parasiting Rhizoctonia solani. A  T. atroviride  T  penetrates R. solani  R . B  Trichoderma  T  grows inside an R. solani  R  hyphae.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   analysis by electron microscopy has shown that during the interaction of Trichoderma spp. with either S. rolfsii or R. solani the parasite hyphae contacted their host and perforated their cell walls. These observations led to the suggestion that Trichoderma produced and secreted mycoly- tic enzymes responsible for the partial degradation of the host’s cell wall.  Indeed, Trichoderma produces a complex set of gluca- nases, chitinases, lipases, and proteases extracellularly when grown on cell walls of R. solani  Geremia et al. 1991; Va´zquez-Garciduen˜as et al. 1998 . Table 1 summarizes the currently available information on this complex set of lytic enzymes produced by Trichoderma. Most attention has been paid to chitinases and several have been studied to some extent in different isolates or even species of the genus. The puriﬁcation and characterization of three endochitinases secreted by T. harzianum was ﬁrst reported by De la Cruz et al.  1992 . They reported the isozymes to be 37, 33, and 42 kDa, respectively. Only the puriﬁed 42 kDa chitinase hydrolyzed Botrytis cinerea puriﬁed cell walls in vitro, but this effect was heightened in the presence of either of the other two isoenzymes  De la Cruz et al. 1992 . The 42 kDa endochitinase has been found in most isolates. Recently, this enzyme has been proposed to play a major role in the regulatory circuits governing the expression of chitinases upon contact of Trichoderma with its host  Kubicek et al. 2001 . Cloning of the genes coding for the 42 kDa secreted chitinases has allowed the construction of a phylogenetic tree,  which showed that they belong to family 18, class V of the glycosyl hydrolases. Interestingly, of the eight fungal species within this clade of the phylogenetic tree, all of them are either fungal or insect parasites and many of the correspond- ing genes have been implicated in their parasitic activity. the chitinolytic system of Trichoderma was However, recently found to be more complex. Two genes showing similarity to the one encoding the 33 kDa endochitinase described by De la Cruz et al.  1992  have been cloned from T. virens  Kim et al. 2002 . These two genes are closely related, according to phylogenetic analysis, and belong to family 18, class III of the glycosyl hydrolases  Kim et al. two types of N-acetyl-b-D- 2002 . Further, at glucosaminidases belonging to family 20 of the glycosyl hydrolases have been identiﬁed in T. harzianum and T. virens  Draborg et al. 1995; Kim et al. 2002 . Chit 36 is another antifungal chitinase recently isolated from T. harzianum TM. This 36 kDa protein shares no signiﬁcant homology to either Chit33 or 42  Viterbo et al. 2001 . In addition, a 40 kDa chitobiosidase and a 28 kDa exochitinase have been puriﬁed  Deane et al. 1998; Harman et al. 1993 .  least  In 1995, Haran and co-workers identiﬁed six distinct intracellular chitinases by activity on gels. This intracellular set of chitinases is apparently composed of two b-1,4-N- acetylglucosaminidases of 102 and 73 kDa, respectively, and four endochitinases of 52, 42, 33, and 31 kDa, respectively. the 102 kDa and the 73 kDa N-acetyl From this set, glucosaminidases and the 42 kDa endochitinase, were  Table 1 Trichoderma genes encoding cell-wall degrading enzymes  Gene  Trichoderma spp.  Strain  Encoded protein  References  Th-En42 ech42 chit42 ech1 th-ch ENC1 ech2 ech3 chit33 cht1 cht2 chit36 nag1 exc1 nag1 exc2 nag2 bgn13.1 bgn1 bgn2 gluc78 bgn3 prb1  T. atroviride T. atroviride T. harzianum T. virens T. harzianum T. harzianum T. virens T. virens T. harzianum T. virens T. virens T. harzianum T. atroviride T. harzianum T. virens T. harzianum T. virens T. harzianum T. virens T. virens T. atroviride T. virens T. atroviride  P1 IMI206040 CECT2413 Tv29-8 Tam-61 T25-1 Tv29-8 Tv29-8 CECT2413 Tv29-8 Tv29-8 TM P1 T25-1 Tv29-8 T25-1 Tv29-8 CECT 2413 Tv29-8 Tv29-8 P1 Tv29-8 IMI206040  42-kDa endochitinase 42-kDa endochitinase 42-kDa endochitinase 42-kDa endochitinase 42-kDa endochitinase 42-kDa endochitinase 42-kDa endochitinase Endochitinase 33-kDa endochitinase 33-kDa endochitinase 33-kDa endochitinase 36-kDa endochitinase 73-kDa N-acetyl-b-D-glucosaminidase 73-kDa N-acetyl-b-D-glucosaminidase N-acetyl-b-D-glucosaminidase N-acetyl-b-D-glucosaminidase ??

In conclusion, the complexity and diversity of the chitinolytic system of T. harzianum involves the complementary modes of action of a diversity of enzymes, all of which might be required for maximum efﬁciency against a broad spectrum of chitin containing plant pathogenic fungi.  Trichoderma atroviride also secretes b-1,3-glucanases in the presence of different glucose polymers and fungal cell walls. The level of b-1,3-glucanase activity secreted by T. atroviride was found to be proportional to the amount of glucan present in the inducer. The fungus produces at least seven extracellular b-1,3-glucanases upon induction with laminarin, a soluble b-1,3-glucan. The molecular weights of ﬁve of these enzymes fall in the range from 60 to 80 kDa, and their pIs are 5.0 – 6.8. In addition, a 35-kDa protein with a pI of 5.5 and a 39-kDa protein are also secreted  Va´zquez- Garciduen˜as et al. 1998 . bgn13, which encodes a 78 kDa protein from T. harzianum was the ﬁrst endoglucanase gene identiﬁed  De la Cruz et al. 1995 . Recently, two genes showing high homology to bgn13.1 have been identiﬁed in T. virens. These endoglucanases belong to family 55 of the glycosyl hydrolases  Kim et al. 2002 . In addition, a 78 kDa exo-b-1,3-glucanase from T. harzianum has been characterized  Donzelli and Harman 2001 .  From the set of glucanases produced by Trichoderma two b-1,6-endoglucanase genes have been identiﬁed, one in T. harzianum and one in T. virens  Kim et al. 2002; Lora et al. 1995 . These two genes encode nearly identical proteins belonging to family 5 of the glycosyl hydrolases  Kim et al. 2002 .  In 1993, Geremia and co-workers reported the isolation of a 31 kDa basic proteinase, which is secreted by T. harzianum during simulated mycoparasitism. The corresponding gene   prb1  was cloned and characterized  Geremia et al. 1993  and was the ﬁrst report of the cloning of a mycoparasitism- related gene.  3 EXPRESSION OF MYCOPARASITISM  RELATED GENES  MRGs   Expression of extracellular chitinolytic enzymes is highly induced by growing Trichoderma on puriﬁed chitin, fungal cell walls, or mycelia as sole carbon source. It has been proposed that chitinolytic enzymes could be induced by soluble chito-oligomers  Reyes et al. 1989; St. Leger et al. 1986 . This appears to be the case for the 73 kDa N-acetyl-b- D-glucosaminidase of T. harzianum and T. atroviride, which are induced not only by chitooligomers but also by N-acetyl- b-D-glucosamine. The 42 kDa endochitinase of T. harzianum responds similarly to these compounds but ech42 expression in T. atroviride is not induced by the products of chitin degradation  Carsolio et al. 1999; De la Cruz et al. 1993;  Mach et al. 1999; Schikler et al. 1998; Ulhoa and Peberdy 1991; Ulhoa and Peberdy 1993 . Expression of ech42 in T. atroviride is strongly induced during fungus – fungus interaction. Its expression is repressed by glucose, may be affected by other environmental factors, such as light and may even be developmentally regulated  Carsolio et al. 1994 . In general, formation of most chitinolytic enzymes does not occur or is inhibited in the presence of glucose, sucrose, and chitinolytic end products  Carsolio et al. 1994; 1999; De la Cruz et al. 1993; Garcı´a et al. 1994; Peterbauer et al. 1996; Ulhoa and Peberdy 1991 . In addition, there is evidence suggesting that the expression of at least ech42 of T. atroviride and chit33 of T. harzianum is repressed by high levels of ammonium  Donzelli and Harman 2001; Mercedes de las et al. 2001 . In this sense, the proteinase encoding gene prb1 responds to carbon and nitrogen limitation. It has also been suggested that the MRGs chit33, ech42, and prb1, respond to other types of physiological stress  Mach et al. 1999; de las Mercedes et al. 2001; Olmedo-Monﬁl et al. 2002 . Recently, we found that the response of ech42 and prb1 to nutrient limitation depends on the activation of conserved mitogen activated protein kinase  MAPK  path- ways  Olmedo-Monﬁl et al. 2002 .  The level of production of b-1,3-glucanases by T. atroviride is induced by the presence of cell walls of M. rouxii, N. crassa, S. cerevisiae, and R. solani  in ascending order of efﬁciency  and appears to be dependent on the amount of b-1,3-glucan present in the cell walls of these organisms  Va´zquez-Garciduen˜as et al. 1998 . Additional results obtained with a ﬁltrate of autoclaved S. cerevisiae cell walls suggest that the induction observed with cell walls may be triggered by two components, one extractable and one that remains cell-wall bound  Va´zquez-Garciduen˜as et al. 1998 . In general, glucanase expression is repressed by glucose and in some cases, might be repressed by primary nitrogen sources  Donzelli and Harman 2001 .  In summary, expression of all enzymes from the cell-wall degrading system of Trichoderma appears to be coordinated. Suggesting a regulatory mechanism involving substrate induction and catabolite repression. The expression of the system is controlled at the level of transcription as indicated by Northern analysis of the available genes  Carsolio et al. 1994; De la Cruz et al. 1995; Donzelli and Harman 2001; Flores et al. 1997; Geremia et al. 1993; Kim et al. 2002; Limo´n et al. 1995; Mercedes de las et al. 2001 . An exciting ﬁnding in terms of signaling is that the induction of at least two MRGs, namely prb1 and ech42, is triggered by a diffusible factor produced by the host  Corte´s et al. 1998 . Recently, it has been suggested that the activation of MRGs in response to the presence of the host, through such a molecule depends on the basal expression of ech42 in T. atroviride  Kubicek et al. 2001 . However, in T. virens, induction of four MRGs in response to cell walls in ech1  the homologue of ech42  knockout mutants is still observed. Whether a key in vivo switches on the molecule produced by the host expression of MRGs remains to be proven, as well as the role of Ech42 in the production of such a molecule.

Indeed some isolates of Trichoderma excrete growth inhibitory substances  Claydon et al. 1987; Ghisalberti and Sivasithamparam 1991; Sivan et al. 1984 . Claydon et al.  1987  identiﬁed volatile alkyl pyrons produced by T. harzianum that were inhibitory to a number of fungi in vitro. When these metabolites were added to a peat-soil mixture, they reduced the incidence of R. solani-induced damping-off on lettuce. However, there is insufﬁcient evidence to be conclusive about their contribution to pathogen suppression and disease reduction in situ. Trichoderma also produces linear oligopeptides of 12 – 22 aminoacids  pep- taibols , which are rich in -aminoisobutyric acid, N-acetylated at the N-terminus and containing an amino alcohol at the C-terminus  Rebuffat et al. 1989; 1991 . These oligopeptides are known to form voltage-gated ion channels in black lipid membranes and modify the membrane permeability of liposomes  El Hadjji et al. 1989 . This suggested a scenario where cell-wall degrading enzymes weaken the cell wall and peptaibol antibiotics inhibit synthesis of cell-wall com- ponents, impairing the capacity of the hyphae to repair the effect of cell-wall degrading enzymes  Lorito et al. 1996a,b . This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the action of cell- wall degrading enzymes is synergistic with that of antibiotics  Lorito et al. 1996a,b .  5 ROLE OF MRGs IN BIOCONTROL AND  STRAIN IMPROVEMENT  A major challenge for researchers investigating the mechanisms involved in the parasitic activity of Trichoderma has been to establish the role of cell-wall degrading enzymes in the process. In fact, we have proposed to call all genes encoding cell-wall degrading enzymes MRGs, because of their apparent relation to the process, until their role is fully determined. Intensive efforts using genetic engineering are currently being directed at this goal. In 1997, Flores and coworkers generated transgenic T. atroviride lines carrying multiple copies of prb1. The resulting strains produced up to 20 times more proteinase and all strains tested were more effective in the control of R. solani. One strain reduced the disease incidence caused by R. solani on cotton plants to only 6% whereas the disease incidence for the nontransformed strain was 30%  Flores et al. 1997 , demonstrating that prb1 plays an important role in biocontrol and the feasibility of strain improvement through genetic engineering.  The role of the Trichoderma 42 kDa endochitinases in mycoparasitism has been addressed by genetic manipulation of the corresponding gene  ech42 and ech1  in T. atroviride and T. virens  Baek et al. 1999; Carsolio et al. 1999; Woo et al. 1999 . In T. atroviride, several transgenic strains carrying multiple copies of ech42 were generated  Carsolio et al.  1999 , as well as the corresponding gene disruptants  Carsolio et al. 1999; Woo et al. 1999 . The level of extracellular endochitinase activity when T. atroviride was grown under inducing conditions increased up to 42 fold in multicopy strains as compared to the nontransformed strain. Multicopy transformants reduced disease incidence by about 10%. Furthermore, a 30% higher degradation of the chitin content in R. solani cell walls was observed during interaction with the overexpressing Trichoderma than with the wild type, when quantiﬁed by transmission electron microscopy  Carsolio et al. 1999 . In the case of the gene disruptants no differences in their efﬁciency to control R. solani or S. rolfsii were observed in greenhouse experiments, as compared to the nontransformed control strains  Carsolio et al. 1999 . In a second study  Woo et al. 1999 , a reduction of the antifungal activity in vitro of the ech42 disrupted strains towards B. cinerea was observed. However, in vivo tests against B. cinerea by leaf inoculation of bean plants revealed a signiﬁcant reduction of their biocontrol capacity. Contrasting with these results, ech42 gene disruptants showed increased efﬁciency to control R. solani in soil. Similar experiments in T. virens showed increased and decreased biocontrol activity against R. solani on cotton using ech1 overexpressing lines and gene disruptants, respectively  Baek et al. 1999 .  The role of Chit33 and Chit36 from T. harzianum in biocontrol has also been tested by expressing the correspond- ing gene at high levels using the strong constitutive pki promoter  Limo´n et al. 1999; Viterbo et al. 2001 . Test of R. solani control under greenhouse conditions suggested higher efﬁciency of Trichoderma transformants bearing the chit36 gene under the pki promoter, but this did not reach statistical signiﬁcance  Viterbo et al. 2001 . The transgenic lines generated overexpressing Chit 33 showed higher antagonistic activity against R. solani on agar plates. However, in vivo experiments with these transgenic lines have not been reported. In another attempt  to increase the effectiveness of T. harzianum, it was transformed with a bacterial chitinase gene from Serratia marcescens under the control of the CaMV35S promoter. Two transformants showed increased constitutive chitinase activity and expressed a protein of the expected size  58 kDa . When evaluated in dual cultures against the phytopathogenic fungus S. rolfsii both showed higher antagonistic activity, as compared to the nontrans- formed control  Haran et al. 1993 . Unfortunately, no in vivo experiments were reported using these strains.  Recently, the role of glucanases in the interaction between T. harzianum and Pythium ultimum was studied  Benhamou and Chet 1997 . Contact between the two fungi was accompanied by the deposition of a cellulose-enriched material at potential penetration sites. Trichoderma was able to penetrate this barrier, indicating that cellulolytic enzymes were produced. However, cellulase production was not the only critical trait involved in the process. A marked alteration of the b-1,3-glucan component of the Pythium cell wall was also observed, suggesting that b-1,3-glucanases played a key role in the antagonism. In yet another study,  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   T. longibrachiatum transformants carrying extra copies of the egl1 gene  a cellulase encoding gene  were evaluated for their biocontrol activity against P. ultimum on cucumber seedlings  Migheli et al. 1998 . The transformants showed a signiﬁcantly higher level of expression of the egl1 gene in comparison to the wild type under both inducing and noninducing growth conditions. Transformants with the egl1 gene under the control of a constitutive promoter had the highest enzymatic activity. Both the endoglucanase activity and the transforming sequences were stable under non- selective conditions. When applied to cucumber seeds sown in P. ultimum-infested soil, T. longibrachiatum transformants with increased inducible or constitutive egl1 expression generally were more suppressive than the wild-type strain.  the b-tubulins of T. viride;  Biocontrol agents tolerant to speciﬁc pesticides could be constructed using molecular techniques. Resistance to the is conferred by a single amino-acid fungicide benomyl substitution in one of the corresponding gene has been cloned and proven to work in other Trichoderma species  Goldman et al. 1993 , thereby producing a biological control agent that could be applied simultaneously or in alternation with the fungicide. However, these strains have not been tested in biocontrol experiments. Molecular techniques may eventually be used to transfer several beneﬁcial traits, such as the production of one or more antibiotics and pesticide tolerance, to an aggressive phyllosphere colonizer.  6 COMPETITION  Competition occurs between microorganisms when space or nutrients  i.e., carbon, nitrogen, and iron  are limiting and its role in the biocontrol of plant pathogens has been studied for many years, with special emphasis on bacterial biocontrol agents  Weller 1988 . Implicit in this deﬁnition is the understanding that combative interactions such as antibiotic production, mycoparasitism, or the occurrence of induced resistance in the host are excluded even though these mechanisms may form an important part of the overall processes occurring in the interaction. In the rhizosphere, competition for space as well as nutrients is of major importance. Thus, an important attribute of a successful rhizosphere biocontrol agent would be the ability to remain at high population density on the root surface providing protection of the whole root for the duration of its life. Recently, it was found that a strain of T. harzianum  T-35  that controls Fusarium spp. on various crops might take advantage of competition for nutrients and rhizosphere colonization  Sivan and Chet 1989 .  7  INDUCED RESISTANCE  Induced resistance is a plant response to challenge by microorganisms or abiotic agents such that following the inducing challenge de novo resistance to pathogens is shown  in normally susceptible plants  de Wit 1985  Induced resistance can be localized, when it is detected only in the area immediately adjacent to the inducing factor or systemic, where resistance occurs subsequently at sites throughout the plant. Both localized and systemically induced resistances are nonspeciﬁc.  Recently, the potential of T. harzianum T-203 to trigger plant defense responses was investigated by inoculating roots of cucumber seedlings with Trichoderma in an aseptic, hydroponic system  Yedidia et al. 1999 . Trichoderma-treated plants were more developed than nontreated plants through- out the experiment. Electron microscopy of ultrathin sections from Trichoderma-treated roots revealed penetration of T. harzianum, mainly to the epidermis and outer cortex. Strengthening of the epidermal and cortical cell walls was observed, as well as deposition of newly formed barriers. These typical host reactions were found beyond the sites of potential fungal penetration. Wall appositions contained large amounts of callose and inﬁltrations of cellulose. Further biochemical analyses revealed that inoculation with the fungus resulted in increased peroxidase and chitinase activities in roots and leaves of treated seedlings, providing evidence that T. harzianum may induce systemic resistance mechanisms in cucumber plants  Yedidia et al. 1999 .  8 PLANT GROWTH PROMOTION  Microbial interactions with plant roots are known to affect profoundly plant nutrient status and, for manganese at least, to affect plant resistance to pathogens  Huber and McCay-Buis 1993 . In addition to their biocontrol characteristics, Trichoderma species also exhibit plant-growth-promoting activity  Baker 1989; Chet 1987; Harman and Bjorkman 1998; Inbar et al. 1994; Kleifeld and Chet 1992; Naseby et al. 2000 . In spite of their theoretical and practical importance, the mechanisms responsible for the growth response due to Trichoderma have not been investigated extensively. Since growth enhancement has been observed in the absence of any detectable disease  Chang et al. 1986; Harman and Bjorkman 1998; Naseby et al. 2000  and in sterile soil  Windham et al. 1986 , it is not thought to be a side effect of suppression of disease or minor plant pathogens. Other mechanisms, including production of hormonelike metabolites and release of nutrients from soil or organic matter, have been proposed  Kleifeld and Chet 1992; Windham et al. 1986 .  The plant-growth-promoting capacity of T. harzianum to solubilize in vitro some insoluble or sparingly soluble minerals via three possible mechanisms: acidiﬁcation of the medium, production of chelating metabolites, and redox activity was recently investigated  Altamore et al. 1999 . T. harzianum was able to solubilize MnO2, metallic zinc, and rock phosphate  mostly calcium phosphate . Fe2O3, MnO2, Zn, and rock phosphate were also solubilized by cell-free culture ﬁltrates. A size exclusion chromatographic separation of the components of the culture ﬁltrates indicated the presence of a complexed form of Fe but no chelation of Mn.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   In liquid culture, T. harzianum also produced diffusible metabolites capable of reducing Fe III  and Cu II . Solubili- zation of metal oxides by Trichoderma involves both chelation and reduction  Altamore et al. 1999 .  9 TRICHODERMA AS A SOURCE OF GENES  FOR CROP IMPROVEMENT  resistance of  the host plant  One of the major goals of plant genetic engineering is to protect plants from diseases. There are many examples of the introduction of chitinase genes into plants resulting in an enhancement of to fungal pathogens  Broglie et al. 1993; Lin et al. 1995; Vierheilig et al. 1993 . However, the desired levels of resistance for successful commercial application have not yet been reached. The use of potent chitinases with proven antifungal activity is thus an attractive alternative. Because Ech42 from T. atroviride fulﬁlls these criteria, the corresponding gene was introduced into tobacco and potato  Lorito et al. 1998 . High expression levels of the fungal gene were obtained in different plant tissues, with no visible effect on plant growth and development. Substantial differences in endochitinase activity were detected among different transformed lines. Transgenic lines were highly tolerant or completely resistant to the foliar pathogens Alternaria alternata, Alternaria solani, B. cinerea, and the soilborne pathogen R. solani. Interest- ingly, the levels of tolerance reached in these experiments were higher than those previously achieved by expression of bacterial or plant chitinases  Lorito et al. 1998 .  A similar strategy was used to improve scab resistance of apple  Bolar et al. 2000 . The endochitinase gene  ech42 , as cDNA and genomic clones, was transferred into apple cv. Marshall McIntosh. Eight lines propagated as grafted and self-rooted plants were inoculated with Venturia inaequalis. Six transgenic lines expressing the endochitinase were more resistant than controls. Disease severity in the transgenic lines tested compared with nontransformed controls was reduced, as well as the number of lesions and the leaf area infected. However, in contrast with the results previously reported  Lorito et al. 1998 , expression of the endochitinase also had negative effects on the growth of both inoculated and uninoculated plants  Bolar et al. 2000 . In a more recent investigation the same group introduced either an endo- chitinase or an exochitinase, both from Trichoderma, into apple plants  Bolar et al. 2001 . In agreement with their previous results resistance to V. inaequalis correlated with the level of expression of either enzyme. Plants expressing both enzymes simultaneously were more tolerant that plants expressing either enzyme alone. Their results indicate that the two enzymes acted synergistically to limit disease development.  increased, our understanding of the mechanisms used by Trichoderma to antagonize phytopathogenic fungi is still very limited.  Little is known on the signaling pathways that determine host recognition, although there is evidence of the involve- ment of conserved signaling pathways such as heterotrimeric G proteins in hyphal coiling. At later stages of the interaction, MAPK pathways appear to participate in the regulation of the expression of MRGs. However, we are still just beginning to untangle the networks determining host recognition.  An important number of genes encoding cell-wall degrading enzymes have been cloned. In most cases, their expression correlates with conditions that simulate the actual interaction with the host and some of them have even been used to generate improved strains. However, the fact that several of the cloned MRGs respond to multiple environ- mental signals that they are subjected to catabolite repression, and that none of them is expressed speciﬁcally at the sites of interaction, suggests that these genes maybe part of a specialized saprophytic response. Thus, the corresponding enzymes are more likely to participate in the utilization of the host’s cellular components as a food supply at the end of the parasitic process. An alternative explanation is that the interaction of Trichoderma with a host is interpreted by the parasite as a stress signal and that MRGs are in fact stress responsive genes. It is likely that genes coding for key enzymes such as those expressed speciﬁcally at the site of interaction where penetration or cell wall perforations are observed, have not been yet identiﬁed. The use of functional genomics strategies will certainly be a major step towards the identiﬁcation of genes playing key roles in mycoparasitism by Trichoderma. Trichoderma has already proven to be an important source of genes for engineering plants for pathogen resistance. Yet, there is still a complete battery of genes that should be tested for this purpose, as well as combinatory strategies using several Trichoderma genes. Induction of defense responses in host plants and plant growth promotion are important attributes of Trichoderma, whose study was neglected for a long time. The recent evidence on these two aspects makes Trichoderma an even more attractive organism for large-scale application as a biological control agent. In spite of our limited knowledge on the mechanisms underlying the mycoparasitic activity of Trichoderma, it is clear that it is an excellent model system for the study of interfungal parasitic relationships and that it has an enormous potential for a variety of biotechnological applications.

Utkhede Paciﬁc Agri-Food Research Centre, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Agassiz, British Columbia, Canada  1  INTRODUCTION  Vegetable crops may be produced as both fresh market and processed commodities and can be grown under ﬁeld conditions or in controlled environments, such as glasshouses or other similar structures. There are numerous fungal diseases that attack a wide range of these vegetable crops  Howard et al. 1994 , thereby reducing crop yield and quality. Methods for disease control have included the use of cultural practices to reduce pathogen inoculum and disease incidence, development of resistant cultivars, as well as the application of chemical fungicides to inhibit pathogen development. The use of biological control strategies has also demonstrated the potential of fungi and yeasts in reducing a range of fungal pathogens that cause various diseases on vegetable crops.  In this chapter, some examples of recent successes in biological control of fungal diseases of vegetable crops using fungi and yeasts, and the mechanisms by which pathogen control was achieved will be reviewed. In addition, the utilization of techniques in biotechnology to aid in the implementation of biological control strategies for disease control will be reviewed. These include techniques to investigate mechanism s  of action of the biological control agent, development of strains with enhanced efﬁcacy through genetic manipulation, monitoring the growth and spread of biocontrol agents using molecular techniques, and characteriz- ation of strains using genetic markers and biochemical methods. The diseases to be considered in this chapter for which biocontrol strategies have been described include those caused by pathogenic fungi that infect the seed and early  seedling growth, causing seed decay and stages of these fungi are Rhizoctonia damping-off. Examples of solani Ku¨hn, various species of Fusarium and Pythium, and Sclerotium rolfsii Sacc. Fungal pathogens that infect the roots and crown of developing plants, causing root and crown rots and vascular wilts, have also been researched for biological control strategies. These include fungi such as Pythium spp., Fusarium spp., and Sclerotinia sclero- tiorum  Lib.  de Bary. A third group of foliar-infecting fungi of vegetable crops that cause leaf spots and blights and stem infection, also have biological control strategies them. These include Botrytis cinerea developed against Pers. ex Fr.  gray mold , Didymella bryoniae  Auersw.  Rhem  gummy stem blight , S. sclerotiorum  white mold , and Sphaerotheca and Erysiphe spp.  powdery mildews .  Many different fungal and yeast biological control agents have been identiﬁed and evaluated for disease control potential against the above-mentioned pathogens, and some have been formulated and brought to market to provide disease control options for producers of vegetable crops. The use of biological control agents may be particularly attractive for vegetable crops grown in glasshouses, due to the high market value of these crops and the possibility for control of environmental parameters, particularly temperature and relative humidity  Paulitz and Be´langer 2001 . These are important variables that can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the efﬁcacy of biological control agents under natural ﬁeld conditions  Paulitz 1997 . The rationale for development of biological control agents against fungal diseases on vegetable crops was to provide an additional alternative approach to augment replace the use of  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   chemical fungicides, to provide a level of disease control in the absence of crop genetic resistance, and to augment cultural control practices to further minimize the impact of these diseases and reduce chemical residues in food. For example, chemical fungicides typically have provided adequate control of many fungal pathogens. However, fungicide resistance problems, concerns regarding pesticide residues, and revoca- tion of registration of certain widely-used fungicides, have led to increased activity in the development of biocontrol agents against foliar fungal pathogens.  For a potential biological control agent to reach the stage of commercial deployment, numerous criteria have to be satisﬁed and considerable data need to be obtained to demonstrate aspects of efﬁcacy, survival, adaptability, and scale-up. These aspects are reviewed elsewhere  Avis et al. 2001a; Cook 1993; Harman 2000; Lumsden et al. 1996  and will not be discussed in this chapter. Several agricultural chemical companies and a number of companies with specialized agricultural products have invested in the discovery and development of biological control agents to complement synthetic pesticides for the control of diseases on horticultural crops. These products are targeted to markets where they have the best chance of performing and where there is the most need, e.g., for control of seed and root- infecting pathogens on seedlings  Whipps 2001 . A range of commercially available biological control products for plant disease control is now available  Fravel 2000  and are more likely to be brought in the future. Molecular methods have been described that can be adapted for use to ensure quality control and monitoring of the biocontrol agents  Avis et al. 2001a .  to market  2 BIOCONTROL OF SEED ROTS AND  DAMPING-OFF DISEASES  Germination of plant seeds is accompanied by the exudation of host nutrients into the soil environment, which frequently attract potentially damaging fungi such as Pythium spp., R. solani, and Fusarium spp. These fungi utilize the seed and root exudates as an energy source for germination and growth, and subsequently penetrate and colonize the seed and root hairs, causing rot and damping-off of emerging seedlings. These fungi are favored by cool  15 – 208C  and moist conditions. Fungal biological control agents have been described which when applied to the surface of seed, to the planting substrate, or when applied shortly after seed germination, can utilize the host nutrient exudates and colonize the seed and developing roots to compete with and exclude the pathogenic fungi. In addition, many of these biocontrol agents secrete hydrolytic enzymes and antibiotics that inhibit the development of the pathogenic fungi. The most widely-researched of these biocontrol agents are species of Trichoderma and Gliocladium and to a lesser extent Penicillium spp.  Table 1 .  3 BIOCONTROL OF ROOT AND CROWN  ROTS AND VASCULAR WILT DISEASES  Pathogenic fungi which infect the root system and crown tissues through root hairs, natural openings, or wounds, can rapidly colonize these tissues and enter the vascular tissues, causing decay and death of the plants. Most of these pathogens infect during the early stages of plant development, although disease symptoms may only be manifested later. Fungal biological control agents have been described which when applied to the seed, planting medium, or roots of plants, can colonize the root system, occupy potential infection sites, and compete with the pathogen. In addition, these agents may enhance resistance in the plants through induction of various defense responses, and secrete hydrolytic enzymes and antibiotics that inhibit pathogen growth and development. The most widely-researched of these biocontrol agents are antagonistic fungi  Trichoderma and Gliocladium species   Pythium, and nonpathogenic, Fusarium, and Rhizoctonia species , as well as mycoparasitic distantly related fungi such as Talaromyces, Coniothyrium, Sporidesmium, Stachybotrys, and Verticillium  Table 1 .  closely-related fungi  3.1 Trichoderma As a Biocontrol Agent of  Seedling Root, Crown, and Vascular Diseases  3.1.1 Trichoderma Species Identiﬁcation  The genus Trichoderma contains species that occur in soils throughout the world. Most species are fast-growing saprophytes with the ability to survive under a range of environmental conditions by utilizing different substrates for growth  Hjeljord and Tronsmo 1998; Samuels 1996 . The most common biological control agents in the genus Trichoderma have been reported to be strains of Trichoderma virens, T. harzianum, and T. viride  Hermosa et al. 2000 . Characterization of 16 biocontrol strains, identiﬁed pre- viously as Trichoderma harzianum Rifai and one biocontrol strain recognized as T. viride, has been carried out using several molecular techniques. A certain degree of poly- morphism was detected among isolates in hybridizations using a probe of mitochondrial DNA. Sequencing of internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2  ITS1 and ITS2  of ribosomal DNA revealed three different ITS lengths and four different sequence types. Phylogenetic analysis based on ITS1 sequences, including type strains of different species, clustered the 17 biocontrol strains into four groups: T. harzianum – T. inhamatum complex, T. longibrachiatum, T. asperellum, and T. atroviride – T. koningii complex. ITS2 sequences were also useful for locating the biocontrol strains in T. atroviride within the complex T. atroviride – T. koningii. None of the biocontrol strains studied corresponded to biotypes Th2 or Th4 of T. harzianum that cause mushroom green mold. A similar study by Dodd et al.  2000  utilized ITS1 and ITS2 sequence data to group 50 isolates of Trichoderma species with biocontrol potential, while ITS1  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

These studies demonstrated the utility of molecular methods to resolve the identity of strains of Trichoderma with potential biocontrol activity that were overlapping in morphological features. This approach could also be used to develop strain- speciﬁc markers for a desired biocontrol strain. Molecular markers were developed and used to detect and trace a strain of T. hamatum in potting mix  Abbasi et al. 1999 .  3.1.2 Trichoderma Biocontrol Activity  Several studies have shown that T. harzianum can control diseases caused by many root-infecting pathogens, including Fusarium, Rhizoctonia, and Pythium  Table 1 . T. harzianum strain KRL-AG2, commercially formulated as F-Stop, when added to a potting soil mix prior to seeding with tomatoes, reduced the incidence and severity of Fusarium root and crown rot caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis- lycopersici  Datnoff et al. 1995 . T. harzianum strain T-22 also provided control of Fusarium crown rot of tomato  Nemec et al. 1996 , and the fungus could be recovered from the roots of treated plants 26 days after application, suggesting it had colonized the roots. T. hamatum reduced the incidence of Fusarium wilt of tomato, caused by F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici, when added to potting medium prior to seeding  Larkin and Fravel 1998 . A commercial formulation of T. harzianum  Rootshield strain T-22  was also evaluated against this disease and was found to signiﬁcantly reduce it when incorporated into potting mix at 0.2%  Larkin and Fravel 1998 . Strain T-22 of T. harzianum was generated by fusing a mutant strain capable of colonizing plant roots with a strain able to compete with bacteria under iron-limiting conditions using protoplast fusion techniques  Harman 2000 . This new strain had the enhanced ability to colonize the root system of host plants, resulting in greater efﬁcacy as a biological control agent for long-term root protection  Harman 2000; Harman and Bjo¨rkman 1998; Sivan and Harman 1991 .  A number of commercial formulations are available that contain strains of T. harzianum for use against different diseases on a wide range of crops. These products are registered for use against a number of soilborne pathogens. Among these products, RootShielde, T-22G, and T-22 Planter Boxe contain T. harzianum strain T-22 that is able to survive well in the rhizosphere of plants  Fravel 2000 .  3.1.3 Trichoderma Mechanism of Action  Trichoderma species can confer biological control against soilborne diseases through a number of mechanisms, including antibiosis, parasitism, competition, and the induction of host plant resistance  Hjeljord and Tronsmo 1998 . Trichoderma species are known to produce a range of volatile and nonvolatile secondary metabolites, some of which inhibit other microorganisms and are considered to be antibiotics. These fungi can also penetrate and infect  pathogen structures, such as hyphae, causing them to be degraded through the production of cell wall degrading enzymes, such as chitinases, glucanases, cellulases, and proteinases  Geremia et al. 1993; Schirmbock et al. 1994; Thrane et al. 1997; Zeilinger et al. 1999 . Trichoderma species can compete with pathogens for nutrients, rapidly colonize a substrate and exclude pathogens from infection sites, and colonize senescing tissues and wounds to reduce pathogen colonization  Hjeljord and Tronsmo 1998 . Some strains of Trichoderma are good root colonizers  rhizosphere competent . It has also been reported that T. harzianum  strain T-22  has the ability to directly enhance root growth and plant development in the absence of pathogens  Harman 2000 , and it has been suggested that this was due to the production of a growth-regulating factor by the fungus  Windham et al. 1986 . Altomare et al.  1999  proposed that the ability of T. harzianum to increase plant growth was partially due to the organism’s ability to solubilize nutrients, thus making them more available to host plants. These observations indicate the versatility through which Trichoderma species can manifest biological control activity. Finally, it has been reported that a strain of T. harzianum was able to trigger host defense mechanisms in cucumber plants through enhanced cell wall depositions and induction of defense enzymes, suggesting an indirect effect in the host plant by the biocontrol agent  Yedidia et al. 1999 .  3.1.4 Biotechnological Manipulations of  Trichoderma  longibrachiatum expressing extra copies of  Techniques in biotechnology have been applied to elucidate the role of hydrolytic enzymes, such as chitinases and glucanases, in mycoparasitism by Trichoderma that could lead to biological control activity. Transformants of T. the b-1,4-endoglucanase gene egl1 were found to be better at suppressing Pythium development on cucumber compared to wild-type strains  Migheli et al. 1998 . In addition, transformants of T. harzianum overproducing the proteinase gene prb1 had up to a ﬁve-fold increase in ability to protect cotton seedlings from R. solani  Flores et al. 1996 . Transformants of T. harzianum overexpressing an endochi- tinase gene chit33 were more effective in inhibiting growth of the pathogen R. solani in vitro compared with wild-type strains  Limo´n et al. 1999 . A mutant of T. harzianum that was selected for its enhanced ability to hydrolyze pustulan, a polymer of b-1,6-glucan, had 2 – 4 times more chitinase, b-1,3 and b-1,6 glucanase activity compared to the wild-type, produced three times more extracellular proteins and other compounds, and showed greater inhibition of B. cinerea in vitro  Rey et al. 2001 .These studies reafﬁrm the roles played by fungal enzymes in biocontrol of plant pathogens and also highlight the successes in manipulating biocontrol strains to genetically engineer them to enhance efﬁcacy. Speciﬁcity in the activity of the hydrolytic enzymes was suggested in a study by Woo et al.  1999 , in which the endochitinase ech42 gene encoding for the secreted 42 Kda endochitinase  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.    CHIT 42  was silenced by targeted disruption; it was found that the endochitinase-deﬁcient mutant had similar activity as the wild-type strain against Pythium ultimum, but had enhanced activity against R. solani, and reduced activity against B. cinerea.  A genetically marked strain of T. harzianum was developed by transformation with the b-glucuronidase  uid A  gene and the hygromycin B  hygB  gene for use in population dynamics studies  Thrane et al. 1995 . Techniques utilizing protoplast transformation as well as particle bombardment of conidia have been described for Tricho- derma  Lorito et al. 1993; Thrane et al. 1995 . Population densities of the transformed strain could be monitored in a potting mix  Green and Jensen 1995 , and the presence of the biocontrol agent around wounded tissues was reported.  indicating that  and Lahdenpera¨ 2000 . Primastop is currently registered in Europe and in a number of regions of the United States, and Prestop is expected to be registered in the near future  Niemi and Lahdenpera¨ 2000 . G. catenulatum strain J1446 was able to colonize cucumber roots extensively 5 weeks following its application, the fungus has the ability to survive and proliferate in the rhizosphere of plants. This rhizosphere competence, coupled with its reported ability to act as a mycoparasite  McQuilken et al. 2001  makes G. catenulatum a strong candidate as a biological control agent against a number of vegetable diseases. We have evaluated this biocontrol agent against Pythium root and crown rot of cucumber caused by P. aphanidermatum. Application at the time of seeding signiﬁcantly reduced plant mortality and enhanced seedling growth  Figure 1 .  3.2 Gliocladium As a Biocontrol Agent of  Seedling, Root, Crown, and Vascular Wilt Diseases  Gliocladium virens Miller, Giddens and Foster, a biocontrol agent of a wide range of fungal pathogens, is now classiﬁed in the genus Trichoderma due to similar morphological characteristics that are shared with members of this genus and DNA analysis supported the inclusion of G. virens with the Trichoderma genus  Rehner and Samuels 1994 . One characteristic of G. virens is the ability to produce the antibiotic metabolites gliotoxin and viridin, a characteristic not generally shared with other species of Trichoderma  Papavizas 1985 . G. virens  T. virens  strain GL-3 was evaluated as a seed treatment on tomato against several pathogens, including R. solani, P. ultimum, S. rolfsii, and F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici. The treatment resulted in signiﬁcantly higher seedling establishment  Mao et al. 1998 . A commercial formulation of strain GL-21 of G. virens is registered for use in the United States, under the trade name SoilGarde, and can control P. ultimum and R. solani on vegetables and ornamental seedlings  Koch 1999; Lumsden et al. 1996 . Like T. harzianum strain T-22, certain strains of G. virens have the ability to colonize the rhizosphere of plant roots  Harman 2000 . In addition, the production of gliotoxin occurs rapidly  within a few hours  and can persist for several days to provide high levels of pathogen suppression  Lumsden et al. 1992; Wilhite and Straney 1996 . Gliotoxin has also been shown to act synergistically with endochitinase in G. virens  Di Pietro et al. 1993 .  A related species, G. catenulatum Gilman and E. Abbot, has been reported to be effective in reducing the incidence of damping-off diseases, caused by P. ultimum and R. solani  McQuilken et al. 2001 . Incorporation of a wettable powder formulation of G. catenulatum strain JI446 into peat-based growing media or application as a drench reduced damping- off due to P. ultimum and R. solani. Two commercial formulations of G. catenulatum strain J1446  Prestop and Primastop  have been recently developed  Fravel 2000; Niemi  3.3 Nonpathogenic Fungi As Biocontrol Agents  of Seedling, Root, Crown, and Vascular Wilt Diseases  Nonpathogenic and hypovirulent strains of fungi that are closely related taxonomically to plant pathogenic species have been reported to provide biological control of a number of pathogens, including species of Fusarium, Rhizoctonia, and Pythium. Competition by nonpathogenic strains for host plant nutrients, colonization of roots and infection sites to preclude the pathogen, parasitism of pathogen hyphae, and induction of host plant resistance are mechanisms through which these nonpathogenic strains achieved biological control  Sneh 1998 .  Nonpathogenic Fusarium species  F. oxysporum and F. solani  provided control of Fusarium wilt of tomato  Figure 1 Effect of G. catenulatum, formulated as Prestop, on reducing root rot and damping-off caused by P. aphanidermatum on cucumber seedlings. The plant on the left received the biocontrol agent at seeding time followed by the pathogen 10 days later; the plant in the center received the pathogen only 10 days after seeding; the plant on the right is the uninoculated control. Photograph was taken at 28 days after seeding.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.    Alabouvette et al. 1993; Fuchs et al. 1999; Larkin and Fravel 1998  through systemic induction of host resistance, and an increase in hydrolytic enzyme activity was reported in treated plants  Duijff et al. 1998; Fuchs et al. 1999 . Induction of resistance by nonpathogenic fungi has also been reported to occur for binucleate Rhizoctonia species  Jabaji-Hare et al. 1999; Xue et al. 1998 , P. oligandrum  Benhamou et al. 1997 , and Penicillium oxalicum  DeCal et al. 1999 . In plants treated with these biocontrol agents, induction of host defense responses, alterations of the plant cell wall, and enhanced expression of antifungal enzymes were reported  Benhamou et al. 1997; Jabaji-Hare et al. 1999; Xue et al. 1998 . Further studies on the mechanisms by which these fungi elicit the host defense responses should provide interesting information on this group of biocontrol fungi. Formulations for biocontrol fungi such as binucleate Rhizoctonia species have been described  Honeycutt and Benson 2001 .  3.3.1 Biotechnological Manipulations of  Nonpathogenic Biocontrol Fungi  Techniques in biotechnology have been applied primarily to the nonpathogenic F. oxysporum strains that provide biocontrol of Fusarium wilt on a number of plant species. By creating strains expressing the marker gene b-glucuronidase  GUS  through genetic transformation, the role of compe- tition for root colonization between pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains could be elucidated  Eparvier and Alabouvette 1994 . Nonpathogenic strains differed in their ability to colonize roots and to preclude the pathogenic strains, and the use of GUS-marked strains utilizing the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter pro- vided an estimation of fungal metabolic activity on the roots  Eparvier and Alabouvette 1994 .  A strain of nonpathogenic F. oxysporum transformed with the b-glucuronidase  GusA  and hygromycin B resistance  Hph  genes could be detected at levels as low as 1 ng of mycelia and estimates of fungal biomass on tomato roots were shown to be considerably higher compared to a plating assay method  Bao et al. 2000 , indicating this was a sensitive and rapid assay for in planta. The colonization by the transformed strain of plant roots could be assessed in relation to the extent of colonization of a pathogenic strain of F. oxysporum  Bao and Lazarovits 2001 .  this biocontrol agent  3.4 Mycoparasites As Biocontrol Agents of  Seedling, Root, Crown, and Vascular Wilt Diseases  Nonpathogenic fungi can act as mycoparasites, as exempliﬁed by P. oligandrum, P. nunn, and P. periplocum, which are mycoparasitic on other species of Pythium and can reduce pathogen infection levels and reduce disease  Berry et al. 1993; McQuilken et al. 1992; Paulitz and Baker 1987 . Other include Stachybotrys elegans and mycoparasitic fungi  Verticillium biguttatum affecting R. solani  van den Boogert and Velvis 1994; Tweddell et al. 1995 , Coniothyrium minitans on Sporidesmium sclerotiorum  Budge and Whipps 2001 , S. sclerotivorum on a number of sclerotial-forming soilborne fungi  Mischke 1998 , and Talaromyces ﬂavus on S. rolfsii  Madi et al. 1997 . In addition, T. ﬂavus was reported to produce glucose oxidase and potentially peroxide, which was lethal to sclerotia of V. dahliae  Stosz et al. 1996 . Species of Trichoderma and Gliocladium are also known to be mycoparasitic, as discussed in previous sections of this chapter. All of these mycoparasitic fungi have been demonstrated to reduce diseases caused by a number of different pathogens on a range of vegetable crop species  Table 1 .  4 BIOCONTROL OF FOLIAR-INFECTING  FUNGI  the leaves and stems of Pathogenic fungi which infect developing plants may enter through senescing tissues, wounded regions, or natural openings, or may penetrate host tissues directly. These fungi can infect plants at all stages of development, and are favored by warm  20 – 258C  and humid conditions. Infection results in blighting of the foliage, premature leaf senescence, and compromised plant growth and yield. Biological control agents have been described which when applied to the foliage, can reduce primary infection as well as reduce pathogen development and sporulation, and can colonize wounds and other tissues to preclude pathogen establishment or development. Some of the biological control agents can act as mycoparasites and reduce pathogen growth directly, while others may secrete hydrolytic enzymes and antifungal compounds to reduce pathogen development, or alter pathogen physiology to reduce disease-causing potential. The most widely-researched  Trichoderma, of Ulocladium, Ampelomyces, and Verticillium  and yeasts  Aureobasidium, Cryptococcus, Rhodosporidium, and Rhodotorula .  these biocontrol agents are fungi  4.1 Biocontrol of Gray Mold  Botrytis cinerea Pers:Fr. is an important pathogen on many vegetable crops grown under greenhouse conditions as well as under ﬁeld conditions. Under high humidity conditions or when free moisture is present on the plant surface, the pathogen infects fruits, ﬂowers, leaves, and stems causing tissue decay. This is followed by proliﬁc sporulation of the pathogen, producing a gray mold appearance. Wounded tissues are especially susceptible to this pathogen. Much of the research activity to achieve biological control of B. cinerea on vegetable crops has centered around the use of T. harzianum, followed by Ulocladium spp. and a number of yeasts, as described later.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   4.1.1 Trichoderma As a Biocontrol Agent of  Botrytis Cinerea  Isolate T-39 of T. harzianum  marketed as Trichodexe  provided control of gray mold as well as a number of other fungal diseases of cucumber under commercial greenhouse conditions  Elad 2000a . T. harzianum T-39 was applied as part of a gray mold management program in alternation with chemical fungicides. The biocontrol agent was effective when applied in formulations containing two concentrations of the active ingredient  0.2 and 0.4 g l , at around 1010 cfu g of T. harzianum  Elad et al. 1993 . A number of other research studies have conﬁrmed the efﬁcacy of T. harzianum strains in reducing development of B. cinerea on crops such as cucumber and tomato under laboratory conditions and on greenhouse-grown plants  Dik and Elad 1999; Dik et al. 1999; O’Neill et al. 1996; Utkhede et al. 2000 .  Mechanisms involved in the biological suppression of infection and inoculum potential of B. cinerea by Tricho- derma are numerous and variable and the involvement of two or more mechanisms has been demonstrated in several studies. Reported combinations include antibiosis with enzyme degradation of B. cinerea cell walls and parasitism  Be´langer et al. 1995 ; competition for nutrients followed by interference with pathogenicity enzymes of the pathogen or with induced resistance; and alteration of plant surface wettability combined with antibiosis  Elad 1996 . Since, germinating B. cinerea conidia are dependent on the presence of nutrients to initiate pathogenesis, competition for nutrients is important in biocontrol. Pathogen conidial viability and germination capacity are also potentially affected by the presence of antibiotics produced by Trichoderma and present in the phyllosphere. Slower in action are mechanisms involving induced resistance in the host plant and production of hydrolytic enzymes that degrade B. cinerea cell walls. The latter has been demonstrated much more convincingly in vitro than in the phyllosphere. Biocontrol in established lesions and reduction of sporulation of Botrytis on necrotic plant tissues is a means to minimize secondary spread of pathogen inoculum. Zimand et al.  1996  also demonstrated that the presence of T. harzianum at the site where B. cinerea infects can have an adverse effect upon activity of pathogen enzymes involved in pectin degradation and host cell wall destruction, e.g., pectinase, cutinase, and pectate lyase. Since such enzymes are intimately involved in the infection process by B. cinerea, the effect of the biocontrol agent in reducing their activity in vitro and on the surface of plant leaves could also limit disease development by the pathogen  Kapat et al. 1998 .  The inhibition of pathogen enzymes was proposed to be due to the secretion of serine proteases by T. harzianum  Elad and Kapat 1999 , which could also inhibit pathogen spore germination. The presence of protease inhibitors was found to reduce the biocontrol activity. The potential role of induced plant resistance by T. harzianum for control of B. cinerea was demonstrated by De Meyer et al.  1998 , wherein application of the biocontrol agent to roots or leaves of a number of different plant species was observed to provide protection  against the pathogen on leaves that were spatially separated from the site of application of T. harzianum. This was attributed to induction of systemic resistance that delayed or suppressed spreading lesion formation  De Meyer et al. 1998 .  4.1.2 Saprophytic Fungi and Yeasts As Biocontrol  Agents of Botrytis Cinerea  is frequently The leaf surface of plants  phylloplane  colonized by a range of saprophytic fungi and yeasts, which rely on plant nutrient exudates and a range of other carbon  nitrogen sources for their survival, e.g., damaged or senescing tissues, pollen grains, insect honeydew. If present in the same niche as plant pathogenic fungi, these saprophytes may compete with pathogens for nutrients, infection sites, or reduce growth and sporulation of the pathogen on host tissues through competition or antagonism  Fokkema 1993 . Recovery of selected fungi and yeasts and reapplication to the leaf or stem surface has identiﬁed a number of potential biological control agents that can reduce diseases caused by B. cinerea. On onion leaf tissues, the saprophytic fungi Alternaria alternata, Chaetomium globosum, Ulocladium atrum, and U. chartarum suppressed sporulation of the pathogen signiﬁcantly when applied after pathogen inocu- lation  Ko¨hl et al. 1995; 1999 . A monoclonal antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  ELISA  has been described to detect and quantify U. atrum in colonized plant tissues  Karpovich-Tate and Dewey 2001  and could be useful in monitoring of this biocontrol agent. Application of the saprophytic fungus Cladosporium cladosporioides to wounds on tomato stems was reported to reduce infection by B. cinerea in laboratory and greenhouse experiments  Eden et al. 1996 .  The yeast-like fungi Aureobasidium pullulans and Cryptococcus albidis signiﬁcantly reduced sporulation of B. cinerea on pruning wounds and stems of cucumber and tomato under laboratory and greenhouse conditions  Dik and Elad 1999; Dik et al. 1999 . Another yeast, Rhodosporidium diobovatum, when applied to tomato stems, reduced lesion size due to B. cinerea and the treated plants yielded higher fruit when compared to the untreated controls  Utkhede et al. 2000 . Both C. albidus and Rhodotorula glutinis reduced sporulation of B. cinerea on bean and tomato leaves and reduced disease levels  Elad et al. 1994 .  4.1.3 Mechanisms of Action of Yeasts Against  Botrytis Cinerea  Yeasts can compete effectively against B. cinerea for nutrients, such as glucose and fructose  Filonow 1998; Filonow et al. 1996 , thereby reducing pathogen colonization of plant tissues and sporulation  Elad et al. 1994 . Yeasts such as Aureobasidium have also been reported to produce mycotoxins in culture  Schrattenholz and Flesch 1993 . Yeast cells may attach to pathogen hyphae, as demonstrated for B. cinerea, and cause them to degrade  Cook et al. 1997  through secretion of cell wall degrading enzymes  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.    Wisniewski et al. 1991 . The production of cell wall degrading enzymes, such as b-1,3-glucanases has also been documented in yeasts such as Pichia anomola that are effective biocontrol agents against B. cinerea as a postharvest treatment  Jijakli and Lepoivre 1998 . In vivo studies with Candida saitoana in apple demonstrated that B. cinerea hyphae had degenerated  El-Ghaouth et al. 1998 , implicating the possible role of toxins and or enzymes. In addition, plant cells in the vicinity of the yeasts appeared to have enhanced structural defense responses, suggesting an induction of defense in the host plant may have occurred. Stimulation of host cell defenses by the yeast C. oleophila was recently described  Droby et al. 2002 .  4.1.4 Biotechnological Techniques Applied to  Yeasts  Yeasts with biocontrol potential against gray mold have been characterized using molecular techniques to provide a method to distinguish between closely-related strains and to identify and monitor survival of strains after application  Schena et al. 2000; 2002 . These techniques include arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction  AP-PCR , random ampliﬁed polymorphic DNA  RAPD-PCR  analysis, and sequence- characterized ampliﬁcation region  SCAR  analysis. In addition, transformation of the yeast Metschnikowia with green ﬂuorescent protein  GFP  was achieved and colonies could be visualized under epiﬂuorescence  Nigro et al. 1999 . The transformed strains behaved similarly to the wild-type strains in biocontrol activity against B. cinerea and in growth rates. Another yeast, A. pullulans, was also transformed with GFP and colonies were readily visible on apple leaf surfaces when subjected to ﬂuorescence and could be quantiﬁed  Wymelenberg et al. 1997 .  Genetic transformation of the yeast Saccharomyces to express a cecropin A-based peptide with antifungal activity was recently described  Jones and Prusky 2002 . The transformants inhibited the growth of Colletotrichum and reduced fungal decay of tomato fruits when applied prior to pathogen inoculation. The expression of the antifungal peptide in the biological control agent suggests a new approach for disease control.  4.2 Biocontrol of Leaf and Stem Blights  Didymella bryoniae  Auersw.  Rehm  anamorph Phoma cucurbitacearum Fr.:Fr.  Sacc. is an important pathogen on greenhouse- and ﬁeld-grown cucumbers and other cucurbits, and causes the disease gummy stem blight. The disease is favored by warm, humid conditions and the pathogen infects stems, leaves, and ﬂowers of susceptible plants, especially through wounded or senescing tissues, and natural openings such as stomata and hydathodes. There are few reports on the potential of using biological control agents to control this disease. Utkhede and Coch  unpublished  applied the yeast R. diobovatum and the biocontrol agent  fruit,  G. catenulatum J1446 as preventative treatments to wounded stem tissues of cucumber followed by inoculation with the pathogen. They demonstrated that both microbial agents signiﬁcantly reduced disease development when compared to plants treated with water. Anthracnose disease of cucumber, caused by Colletotrichum magna, was reduced when a nonpathogenic mutant was applied to seedlings to achieve colonization and induction of defense responses that subsequently protected treated plants against the pathogen  Redman et al. 1999 .  4.3 Biocontrol of Powdery Mildews  Powdery mildew fungi are obligate parasites of plants that derive nutrients and water from their host, thereby reducing growth and yield through the acquisition of photosynthates. The fungi penetrate into the epidermis directly and establish a parasitic relationship with the plant host through the formation of haustoria, the nutrient-absorbing structures. Mycelial growth and sporulation occur on the surface of leaves and stems, resulting in a white fuzzy mildew appearance.  Over the years, powdery mildew diseases have been managed through the use of chemical fungicides and genetic resistance, but recent reports have highlighted the potential of biological control methods. Fungal and yeast biological control agents have been described which can reduce sporulation and growth of mildew pathogens, thereby minimizing their damaging effects to host plants. The fungal biocontrol agents are mostly mycoparasites, while the yeasts produce antibiotics and hydrolytic enzymes that cause the mildew hyphae and conidia to collapse and be rendered nonviable.  4.3.1 Fungi As Biological Control Agents of  Powdery Mildews  Verticillium lecanii has been described as a mycoparasite of powdery mildew fungi as well as a pathogen of insects and it has been developed as a biocontrol agent of insects on greenhouse crops. Strains of V. lecanii differed in their level of antagonism against the powdery mildew pathogen of cucumber, Sphaerotheca fuliginea, under laboratory con- ditions  Askary et al. 1998 . Application to cucumber leaves prior to mildew infection and incubation under high  . 95%  relative humidity conditions reduced mildew development  Verhaar et al. 1997 . The high humidity requirement for growth of this mycoparasite was reduced by the addition of an oil formulation  Verhaar et al. 1999 . Infection of S. fuliginea by V. resulted in disorganized cytoplasm and plasmalemma disruption, possibly due to chitinase enzyme activity  Askary et al. 1997 .  lecanii  Another mycoparasite, Ampelomyces quisqualis, has been extensively studied as a biocontrol agent of powdery mildew of cucumber. The mycoparasite infects the mildew pathogen and forms pycnidia in association with colonized mycelium,  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   reducing growth and sporulation of the pathogen. Cells of the mycoparasite grow inside the mildew hyphae, gradually causing them to degenerate. High levels of b-1,3-glucanase activity were reported in A. quisqualis  Rotem et al. 1999  and exposure of mildew hyphae to the enzymes caused them to degrade.  A commercially available formulation of A. quisqualis AQ10 has been extensively evaluated against powdery mildew development. On cucumbers grown in the green- house, AQ10e was very effective in reducing mildew development  Elad et al. 1998 . On ﬁeld-grown cucurbits, AQ10e also suppressed mildew development and increased yield when compared to the nontreated plants  McGrath and Shishkoff 1999 .  Molecular techniques have been used to characterize strains of A. quisqualis. The RFLP analysis of the nuclear rDNA ITS region and sequence analysis among a worldwide collection of isolates revealed considerable intraspeciﬁc variation  Kiss 1997; Kiss and Nakasone 1998 . Isolates of the same genetic background were found in widely different areas and genetically different isolates could be found in a given area.  4.3.2 Yeasts As Biological Control Agents of  Powdery Mildew  Pseudozyma  Sporothrix  ﬂocculosa is a yeast-like fungus with demonstrated biocontrol activity against powdery  Figure 2 Effect of Tilletiopsis pallescens on development of powdery mildew  S. fuliginea  on cucumber leaves.

Cytochemical investigations have shown that the yeast induces a rapid collapse of mildew spores and hyphal cells  Hajlaoui et al. 1992 . Extracellular fatty acids with antifungal properties were produced by P. ﬂocculosa and reported to be the principle mode of action in biological activity against powdery mildew  Benyagoub et al. 1996 , by disrupting the cytoplasmic membrane in a range of fungi  Avis and Be´langer 2001 . A fungicide-tolerant strain of the yeast was selected which could be used in conjunction with chemical control methods powdery mildew development  Benyagoub and Be´langer 1995 . In a comparative study of three biological control agents against powdery mildew of cucumber, i.e., V. lecanii, A. quisqualis, and P. ﬂocculosa, it was shown that P. ﬂocculosa gave the best disease control  Dik et al. 1998 .  reduce  to  Molecular techniques have been used to characterize strains of Pseudozyma ﬂocculosa  Avis et al. 2001b . Ribosomal DNA sequences and random ampliﬁed micro- satellites were used to distinguish among different strains of this species and to develop isolate-speciﬁc markers to monitor spread and conﬁrm genetic ﬁdelity of the strains. A strain of P. ﬂocculosa has been formulated and produced com- mercially under the name Sporodexe for use in control of powdery mildew on a number of crops grown under greenhouse conditions.  Species of Tilletiopsis are saprophytic yeast-like fungi that occur as epiphytes on the leaf surface of various plant species and which have been demonstrated to have biological control activity against powdery mildew diseases  Hijwegen 1992; Knudsen and Skou 1993; Urquhart et al. 1994 . Scanning  electron microscopic studies have revealed that mildew hyphae and spores appeared collapsed after treatment with Tilletiopsis  Figure 2   Urquhart and Punja 1997 . It was postulated that extracellular antifungal compounds were involved in biocontrol activity that included fatty acid esters and hydrolytic enzymes  Urquhart and Punja 2002 . Various species of Tilletiopsis have demonstrated biological control activity, including T. albescens, T. minor, T. pallescens, and T. washingtonensis  Table 2 . These species could be distinguished using RAPD analysis of PCR-generated DNA with random primers  Urquhart et al. 1997 . Intraspeciﬁc variation was also noted and DNA ﬁngerprints were generated for some isolates that could be useful for monitoring the distribution and spread of certain isolates.  5 CONCLUSIONS  In addition,  The numerous reports of success in the utility of fungal and yeast biological control agents to reduce fungal diseases on vegetable corps illustrate the potential of this approach for disease management. the applications of techniques in biotechnology are providing numerous examples of how these biocontrol agents can be character- ized, monitored, and investigated in more depth. However, there are unique requirements in working with microbial biocontrol agents that must be recognized if this approach to disease control is to be successful.  Environmental conditions, particularly temperature and moisture, can greatly inﬂuence the degree to which fungal and yeast biological control agents can affect fungal diseases on vegetable crops, even in greenhouse environments. Therefore,  Table 2 Examples of fungal and yeast biological control agents that reduce foliar diseases on vegetable crops caused by pathogenic fungi  Target pathogen and host  References  Biocontrol agent  T. harzianum  T. harzianum  T. harzianum T. harzianum G. catenulatum A. quisqualis AQ10 A. pullulans C. albidus  B. cinerea on cucumber  B. cinerea on tomato  C. fulvum on tomato S. fuliginea and S. fusca on cucumber D. bryoniae on cucumber S. fusca on cucumber B. cinerea on tomato and cucumber B. cinerea on bean, tomato, and cucumber  R. glutinis R. diobovatum C. cladosporioides S. ﬂocculosa T. albescens, T. minor, T. pallescens,  and T. washingtonensis  B. cinerea on bean and tomato B. cinerea on tomato B. cinerea on tomato S. fuliginea on cucumber S. fuliginea on cucumber  Dik and Elad  1999  and  Elad et al.  1993; 1998   Dik and Elad  1999 , Migheli  et al.  1994 , and Utkhede et al.  2000   Elad et al.  2000a  Elad et al.  1998; 2000b  Utkhede and Coch  unpublished  Elad et al.  1998  Dik and Elad  1999  Dik and Elad  1999  and  Elad et al.  1994   Elad et al.  1994  Utkhede et al.  2000  Eden et al.  1996  Dik et al.  1998  Hijwegen  1992 , Knudsen and Skou  1993 , Urquhart and Punja  1997 , and Urquhart et al.  1994   Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

The biological control agents are generally most effective when applied as a preventative treatment, prior to or at the onset of disease, and multiple applications may be needed to provide longer-term disease suppression. At high levels of disease pressure, biological control agents can be anticipated to perform less well. Some of the agents may be used in combination with, or in alternation with, chemical fungicides if it can be demonstrated that their survival is not adversely affected. Similarly, it may be possible that combinations of biocontrol agents may be more effective than single organisms although little research has been done in this area. Biological control agents that affect more than one disease should have greater market potential than those that speciﬁcally target a particular disease. It is not clear whether different plant hosts may have an inﬂuence on the efﬁcacy of these biocontrol agents.  Notwithstanding these conditions, the use of fungal and yeast biological control agents has generated signiﬁcant interest in both the scientiﬁc research and product develop- ment arenas to ensure that commercially viable products will continue to be brought to market.

Janisiewicz Appalachian Fruit Research Station, U.S. Department of Agriculture –Agricultural Research Service, Kearneysville, West Virginia, USA  1  INTRODUCTION  Losses from postharvest diseases of fruits have been substantial at the storage, wholesale, retail, and consumers levels. The total losses are very difﬁcult to establish because research has generally considered only one or two levels, and little work has been done to determine losses at the consumer level. Nevertheless, in the United States, losses are estimated to range from 5% for citrus to as much as 20% for strawberries  Cappellini and Ceponis 1984; Eckert and Ogawa 1985 . Most of the fruit decay results from infection through wounds made during harvest and postharvest handling, but for some fruits, infection takes place in the orchard during the growing season, and remains latent. As fruit mature in storage the pathogens become active again and invade fruit tissue. A variety of approaches have been used to reduce postharvest fruit decays, including sanitation to reduce pathogen inoculum, gentler handling of fruit to reduce wounding  Sommer 1982 , physical treatments such as hot water dips and hot air treatments that kill pathogens  Falik et al. 1995; Lurie et al. 1998 , storing produce at low temperatures or in modiﬁed atmosphere which stop or reduce growth of the pathogens  Sommer 1982 , treating fruit with chemicals that enhance natural resistance  El-Ghaouth 1998 , with synthetic fungicides  Eckert and Ogawa 1985; Eckert and Ogawa 1988 , and, more recently, with biocontrol agents  Droby et al. 1998; Janisiewicz and Jeffers 1997; Janisiewicz and Korsten 2002; Korsten et al. 1995; Usall et al. 2001 . Fungicides have been, by far, the most widely used remedy against fruit decay because they are easy to apply and generally, one fungicide is effective against most of the pathogens on a speciﬁc crop. Storage of some fruits for extended periods, e.g., citrus fruits, is totally dependent on the use of fungicides. But postharvest use of synthetic fungicides  has been increasingly curtailed by the perceived hazard to humans and the environment. This has resulted in new regulations restricting or eliminating their use in this country and abroad. It has become increasing difﬁcult to ﬁnd and register new fungicides to replace those to which postharvest pathogens have developed resistance  Gullino and Kuijpers 1994; Ragsdale and Sisler 1994 . Thus, there has been a need to ﬁnd effective alternatives to synthetic fungicides. None of the alternative methods developed during the past two decades have had the broad spectrum of activity as synthetic fungicides. Recently, biological control has emerged as an alternative  Janisiewicz and Korsten 2002 . The full potential of biocontrol has not yet been realized because the mechanisms of biocontrol have not been explained. A fuller understanding of the antagonistic mechanisms will eventually help manipulate and improve the biocontrol system. Although this method has some limitations, these limitations can be addressed by combining biological control with other alternative methods  Conway et al. 1999; El-Ghaouth et al. 2000b; Janisiewicz et al. 1998; Smilanick et al. 1999 . In this chapter, the key elements in the development of biological control of postharvest diseases  BCPD  of fruits, and the current status and future prospects of BCPD of fruits using examples of fungal and bacterial antagonists are discussed.  2 PATHOGENS TARGETED FOR BCPD OF  FRUITS  the host plant  The BCPD of fruits can be approached from the perspective of the microorganisms  wound, intact surface , and the pathogen’s strategy used to infect fruit. The pathogen’s strategy has been emphasized most frequently because many economically  fruits , habitat   different  for  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

These pathogens invade mainly through wounds, and require nutrients for spore germination and initiation of the pathogenic process, which makes them vulnerable to competition for nutrients from surrounding microorganisms. Other mechanisms of biocontrol described later in this chapter may also be involved, but the prevailing evidence suggests that their role is secondary  Janisiewicz and Korsten 2002 . Incipient or latent infections that generally occur in the ﬁeld are less prone to biological control because the pathogen has already established a parasitic relation with the host. However, these pathogens can be controlled by antagonists that prevent infection in the ﬁeld, perpetuate latency by removal of nutrients from areas surrounding the appressoria, or perhaps those that can inhibit pathogen development by the production of antifungal substances or by direct parasitism  Koomen and Jeffries 1993; Korsten and Jeffries 2000; Leibinger et al. 1997 .  The greatest progress in BCPD of fruits has been made against typical wound-invading necrotrophic postharvest pathogens such as Penicillium expansum which causes blue mold of apple, pear, and cherries, Botrytis cinerea which causes gray mold of pome fruits  Janisiewicz and Jeffers 1997 , P. italicum and P. digitatum which causes blue and green-mold of citrus fruits, respectively  Droby et al. 1998 , and against the wound invading phase of brown rot decay of stone fruits caused by Monilinia fructicola  Pusey et al. 1988 . Although the likelihood of infection is dependent on the concentration of fungal spores, the biocontrol strategy has always focused on the preemptive colonization of the wounds by the antagonist to prevent infection, and not on reduction of the pathogen inoculum. Thus, the control of these decays was achieved by the application of antagonists to wounds, simultaneously with the pathogen or shortly after the infection took place. Other potential candidates for this type of biological control are pathogens invading through cut stem of bananas, mangos, and papayas  Eckert 1991 . Since the development of the pathogen depends on fruit maturity and the environment, in the interaction and resulting biological pathogen-antagonist control.  these factors have been critical  Signiﬁcant successes were achieved with biocontrol of latent infections caused by Colletotrichum spp. on mango and avocado  Korsten and Jeffries 2000 , and to a lesser extent by B. cinerea on strawberries  Helbig 2002; Ippolito et al. 1998; Peng and Sutton 1990; Takeda and Janisiewicz, unpublished results . Biological control of these diseases must start in the ﬁeld, relies on multiple application of the antagonist, and is generally more difﬁcult to achieve.  3 ANTAGONIST SELECTION  The ﬁrst successful attempts in BCPD of fruits, which stimulated research in postharvest biological control, used soil isolated bacterium, Bacillus subtilis, to control brown rot  of stone fruits caused by M. fructigena  Pusey and Wilson 1984 . Subsequent works focused on screening natural microﬂora from the aerial surfaces of apple and pear trees for antagonistic activity against decays caused by P. expansum and B. cinerea  Janisiewicz 1987 . This resulted in the isolation of many bacteria and yeasts that were effective in controlling fruit decays caused by these pathogens. Isolation from the fruit surfaces has become a standard practice and is the most efﬁcient source of antagonists against postharvest fruit pathogens of temperate, subtropical, and tropical fruits  Adikaram and Karunaratne 1998; Arras 1993; Chalutz et al. 1988; Chand-Goyal and Spotts 1996; Droby et al. 1999; Guinebretiere et al. 2000; Huang et al. 1992; Kanapathipillai and bte Jantan 1985; Lima et al. 1998; Qing and Shiping 2000; Teixido´ et al. 1998a; Testoni et al. 1993; Zahavi et al. 2000 . A variety of enrichment procedures, employing either fruit juice or tissue, have been used to isolate microorganisms best suited to colonize wounded fruit tissue  Janisiewicz 1991; 1996; Wilson et al. 1993 . The enrichment procedures appear to favor isolation of the resident fruit microﬂora, with the yeasts being isolated most followed by bacteria. Filamentous fungi have been isolated only sporadically  Janisiewicz 1996; Wilson et al. 1993 . The rapid colonization of wounds by yeasts is necessary for pre- emptive exclusion of the wound-invading pathogens. The number of species that are residents on a speciﬁc kind of fruit is limited, and reports from various laboratories worldwide increasingly describe biocontrol potential of the same antagonist species isolated at different locations  Chand- Goyal and Spotts 1996; 1997; Falconi and Mendgen 1994; Ippolito et al. 2000; Janisiewicz et al. 1994; 2001; Leibinger et al. 1997; Lima et al. 1998; McLaughlin et al. 1992; Roberts 1990; Wisniewski et al. 1988 . Recent studies; however, indicate great diversity within an antagonist species, even at a single geographical location, with regard to effectiveness in controlling fruit decays and other in commercializing a biocontrol agent  Janisiewicz et al. 2001; Schena et al. 1999 . Thus, investigating the same species of the antagonist at various locations may lead to ﬁnding an antagonist with superior attributes. An effective antagonist may also be found by screening starter cultures used for food products  Pusey 1991 , various culture collections  Filonow et al. 1996 , and even by exploring an aquatic environment, as is the case with bacteriophages used against soft rotting bacteria  Eayre et al. 1995 .  factors important  frequently,  In addition to being effective in controlling fruit decays, antagonists should have certain attributes to make them good candidates for commercialization. These include: compatibility with postharvest practices  storage tempera- tures, relative humidity-RH, storage atmosphere with elevated CO2 and reduced O2, handling in water, heat drying tunnels, etc. , treatments and additives  waxes, antioxidants, ﬂotation salts , ability to grow efﬁciently in a commercially used media for mass production, ease of formulation, and the lack of potentially deleterious effects on human health that would disqualify them from being approved by regulatory agencies. Human safety, in particular, necessitates a thorough  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   approach in identifying an antagonist. Misidentiﬁcation may result in abandonment of commercial development of the antagonist, and, if not detected early, may be very costly.  4 MECHANISMS OF BIOCONTROL  Various mechanisms of biocontrol have been suggested for antagonists effective in BCPD of fruits and often more than one mechanism was implicated for a single antagonist. In no case, however, was the biocontrol mechanism fully explained. The putative mechanisms included competition for limiting nutrients and space, lysis, induced resistance, direct parasitism, and production of inhibitory substances. Attachment of antagonists to a fungal hyphae was observed in some antagonist-pathogen interactions, but its role remains largely speculative  Arras et al. 1998; Wisniewski et al. 1989; 1991 . The main reasons for the limited knowledge in mechanism of biocontrol have been a lack of appropriate methods to study microbial interactions in wounds of fruit, and the fact that progress in BCPD was driven by advances in microbial ecology of recent advances in microbial sensing of nutrients on plants  Lindow et al. 2002 , molecular approaches  Bassett and Janisiewicz 2001; Jijakli et al. 2001; Jones and Prusky 2002; Yehuda et al. 2001 , and a method allowing separation of competition for nutrient and space using natural substrates  Janisiewicz et al. 2000  may lead to better explanation of the signiﬁcance of various biocontrol mechanisms. Progress in microbial ecology of the antagonists led the commercialization of BCPD of fruits in a relatively short period of time, but further expansion will greatly depend on achieving the full potential of BCPD, for which knowledge of the mechanisms of biocontrol will be essential.  the antagonists. However,  Bacterial antagonists such as Bacillus spp.  Gueldner et al. 1988  or Pseudomonas spp.  Bull et al. 1998; Janisiewicz and Roitman 1988  produce a variety of antifungal compounds in artiﬁcial media, which by themselves can provide effective control of postharvest decays of fruits  Bull et al. 1998; Janisiewicz et al. 1991; Takeda and Janisiewicz 1991 . But the role of these antifungal compounds as the biological control mechanism is uncertain, because they either can not be detected in fruit wounds after inoculation with the antagonist  Bull, personal communi- cation , or pathogen mutants resistant to these inhibitory substances are still controlled by the antagonists  Smilanick, personal communication .  Yeast antagonist such as Pichia anomala strain K  Gravesse et al. 1998; Jijakli and Lepoivre 1998 , P. guilliermondii  Arras et al. 1998; Wisniewski et al. like Aureobasidum pullulans  Castoria 1991 , or yeast et al. 2001  effective in controlling gray mold of apples, produce b-1,3-glucanase, which caused lysis of the B. cinerea hyphae. Production of this enzyme by P. anomala strain K was stimulated in the presence of cell wall preparations of B. cinerea in apple wounds resulting in improved biocontrol  Gravesse et al. 1998; Jijakli and Lepoivre 1998 . This  enzyme also increased in apple wounds treated with the A. pullulans cells, but how much of this increase could be attributed to production by the antagonist, on the fruit itself, was not resolved  Castoria et al. 2001 . This antagonist can also produce aurebasidins, antibiotics whose role has not been determined. The antagonistic yeast, Candida saitoana, effective in reducing decays of citrus and apple, induced chitinase activity in apple  Wilson and El Ghaouth 1993 . C. oleophila, used in the commercial product Aspire, induced resistance responses such as production of chitinase, b-1,3-endoglucanases, PAL, phytoalexins scoparone and scopoletin and ethylene in ﬂavedo tissue of grapefruit  Droby et al. 2002 . The contribution of these induced resistance responses to biocontrol was not determined. The yeast famata, effective in reducing green mold caused by C. P. digitatum on oranges, increased the phytoalexins scopoletin and scoparone 12-fold in fruit wounds after four days, but the role scoparone in biocontrol is uncertain due to its relatively slow production  Arras 1996 . The antagonists Cryptococcus laurentii and Sporobolomyces roseus, effective against gray mold of apple, utilized the apple volatile, butyl acetate, which stimulated germination and adhesion to membranes of B. cinera conidia  Filonow 1999; 2001 . The signiﬁcance of these phenomena in the biological control was not established due to the technical difﬁculties in conducting this type of experiment in fruit wounds. When these antagonists were applied to harvested fruits, they colonized fruit wounds rapidly, and competition for limiting nutrients and space was suggested as an important biocontrol mechanism. Removal of limiting nutrients may also be responsible for maintaining the dormancy of Colletotrichum spp. appresoria on fruit treated with antagonistic Bacillus spp.  Korsten and Jeffries 2000 .  5  IMPROVING BCPD  The goal of the biocontrol improvement program is to realize the full potential of biological control. This may be accomplished by more extensive strain selection of the same antagonist species, as indicated earlier in the case of M. pulcherrima, by manipulating antagonists and or their environment, and by applying the antagonists before harvest in addition to one after harvest.  Postharvest application of the antagonists mixture of P. syringae and S. roseus  Janisiewicz and Bors 1995 , and C. sake and Pantoea agglomerans  Nunes et al. 2002  improved efﬁcacy of biocontrol of blue mold of apples compared to the individual antagonist. An orchard application of a mixture of A. pullulans with Rhodotorula glutinis was more effective than the individual antagonists, and suppressed apple decays caused by Penicillium spp., B. cinerea, and Pezicula malicorticis after harvest to the same level as the commonly used fungicide Euparen  Leibinger et al. 1997 . Nutrient utilization proﬁle of individual antagonists was successfully used to develop antagonist mixtures with a minimum of nutrient overlap between the antagonists and  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   resulted in biocontrol of blue mold of apples that was superior to the individual antagonists  Janisiewicz 1996 .  Physiological manipulation has been focused on improv- ing antagonist ﬁtness by growing them under various conditions that improved resistance to desiccation and survival on the fruit. This is of particular importance to antagonists that are applied in the orchard for control of postharvest decays. C. sake cells grown under water stress caused by addition of glucose or glycerol increased after application to apple trees, while those grown on unmodiﬁed media did not  Teixido´ et al. 1998b . This yeast was more water-stress tolerant when grown on a molasses-based medium than on a medium where water activity  aw  was modiﬁed by the addition of NaCl  Abadias et al. 2001b . In preparing a freeze-dried formulation, viability of the C. sake cells was best maintained when 10% skim milk was combined with other protectants such as lactose, glucose, fructose, or sucrose  Abadias et al. 2001a . In general, the highest viability of the C. sake cells occurred when the protection and rehydration media were the same.  Control of blue mold of apples was improved by the addition of the amino acids L-asparagine or L-proline to the P. syringae antagonist treatment suspensions  Janisiewicz et al. 1992 . These amino acids were selected after screening various C and N sources for their effect on the antagonist and pathogen growth. Both amino acids increased population of the antagonist more than 10-fold in the fruit wounds. The addition of the glucose analog, 2-deoxy-D-glucose, to the antagonistic yeasts S. roseus and C. saitoana signiﬁcantly improved decay control on apple and citrus, respectively  El- Ghaouth et al. 2000c; Janisiewicz 1994 . 2-deoxy-D-glucose can be up taken by the pathogens but it cannot be metabolized as energy source, resulting in reduced pathogen growth, which gives the advantage to the antagonists, and improves biocontrol. Ammonium molybdate stimulated population of the antagonistic yeast C. sake  CPA-1  and improved control of blue mold of apple and pear after harvest  Nunes et al. 2001a . This nutrient also has fungicidal activity and inhibited germination of P. expansum and B. cinerea spores in vitro, and reduced blue mold, gray mold, and Rhizopus stolonifer decay of apple in pre- and postharvest applications  Nunes et al. 2001b .  Use of genetic manipulation to improve BCPD has great potential, but little research has been done in this area. The appearance of decay symptoms on avocado fruit was delayed when the fruit were dipped in a suspension containing a reduced-pathogenicity mutant of the avocado pathogen Colletotrichum gleosporioides  Yakoby et al. 2001 . This mutant was generated by restriction enzyme-mediated integration  REMI  transformation, and induced natural resistance of avocado by increasing production of the antifungal diene from 700 to 1,200 mg g fresh weight 9 days after inoculation. Saccharomyces cerevisiae transformed with a cercopin A-based peptide, inhibits germination of C. cocodes at 50 mM, was able to inhibit the growth of germinated spores, and inhibited decay development caused by C. cocodes on wounded tomato  Jones and Prusky 2002 .  that  This work demonstrated that microorganisms that colonize fruits can be used as vehicles for providing decay control which may include various biocontrol traits.  6  INTEGRATING BCPD WITH OTHER ALTERNATIVES  than for  is generally lower  that are Although BCPD can provide levels of control the performance margin of commercially acceptable, biocontrol fungicides. For example, higher concentrations of the antagonist must be used to achieve the same control of decay as fruit mature. To increase the performance margin of biocontrol, attempts have been made to integrate biocontrol with other alternatives to synthetic fungicide methods that were developed mainly during the past two decades  Conway and Sams 1983; Falik et al. 1995; Smilanick et al. 1995; 1997; 1999; Smoot and Melvin 1965; Spotts 1984; Spotts and Chen 1987; Tukey 1993 . These methods alone did not provide commercially acceptable control of fruit decay, but in combination with biocontrol increased its performance margin.  Inﬁltration of apples with calcium chloride alone reduced blue mold decay by approximately half  Conway and Sams 1983 , but in combination with the antagonist, P. syringae, resulted in greater reduction of fruit decay than either treatment alone  Janisiewicz et al. 1998 . The effects of calcium treatment were greatest on more mature fruit, inoculated after 3 or 6 months in storage, when the effectiveness of biocontrol declines  Conway et al. 1999 . Combining biocontrol with a calcium treatment comp- lements each other to overcome the shortcomings of each, and may allow for reduced amounts of both products to be used without compromising decay control. In addition, applying lower calcium concentrations would reduce potential calcium injury, while maintaining other beneﬁts, including alleviating storage maladies, such as bitter pit. The addition of calcium chloride to the yeast antagonist Candida sp. also improved control of blue mold and gray mold on apples  McLaughlin et al. 1990; Wisniewski et al. 1995 .  Treating apples with hot air  4 d at 388C  may virtually eliminate blue mold of apple but it has no residual effect, and any inoculation with pathogens following heat treatment results in decay  Falik et al. 1995; Lurie et al. 1998 . Combining antagonistic yeasts or bacteria with heat treatment improved control of blue mold on apples  Conway et al. 1999 . The heat treatment eradicated P. expansum infections up to 12 h after inoculation, and yeast and bacterial antagonists provided the residual effect. The heat treatment complemented the lack of eradicative activity of the antagonists, the major shortcoming of BCPD. It may have additional beneﬁts of eradicating pathogens from fruit bins and storage rooms  Douglas 1998 .  Substances generally regarded as safe  GRAS , such as sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, ethanol, acetic acid, hydrogen peroxide, chitosan, or some edible coatings can  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   to the individual  reduce pathogen germination and growth. They are acceptable to the consumers, and in contrast to synthetic fungicides, do not have the prospect of a lengthy and costly approval process from regulatory agencies. For example, sodium carbonate has been used to treat lemons in commercial packinghouses  Smilanick et al. 1999 . Combin- ing 3% sodium carbonate with the antagonist P. syringae ESC-10 was superior treatments in controlling green mold on citrus  Smilanick et al. 1999 . This compound also improved control of blue mold and gray mold of oranges in combination with antagonist P. agglomerans  CPA-2   Teixido et al. 2001 . Sodium carbonate has up to 24 h of eradicative activity, but little residual activity, which, like heat treatment, complements biocontrol. Treatment of lemons with 10% ethanol reduced green mold to less than 5%  Smilanick et al. 1995 . The addition of 10% ethanol to suspensions of S. cerevisiae strains 1440 and 1749, which had little biocontrol activity, reduced gray mold decay of apple from more than 90% to close to 0%  Mari and Carati 1998 . Chitosan and its derivatives can reduce fungal growth and induce resistance responses in harvested fruits and vegetables  Allan and Hadwiger 1979; El-Ghaouth 1998 . The addition of 0.2% glycolchitosan to a suspension of the antagonist C. saitoana increased control of green mold of oranges and lemons, and gray and blue mold of apples over that of the antagonist alone  El-Ghaouth et al. 2000a, b .  treatments. The above examples of  There are many more possibilities for combining biocontrol agents with GRAS substances or other nonfungi- cidal improving biocontrol and integrating biocontrol with other nonfungici- dal treatments demonstrate that biocontrol is amenable to manipulation and can be easily integrated with various decay control measures resulting in additive or synergistic effects. Strategies must be developed for the integration of various treatments in order to maximize decay control  Conway et al. 1999 . Various control measures may be applied in succession and these applications may be customized to ﬁt different postharvest practices.  7 COMMERCIALIZATION OF BCPD  Finding an industry partner is essential for the commerciali- zation of any antagonist for postharvest biocontrol. Formulation, pilot tests, toxicology tests, and registration of the product are expensive and entail more than most research programs in government laboratories or academia are equipped to handle. Although there are examples of commercialization of biocontrol products for plant diseases control by individual scientists, especially from academia, they generally involve creation of a private company that can generate venture capital. USDA ARS has developed a number of useful vehicles that allow private industry to commercialize inventions created in government labora- tories by working jointly with the government scientists. These include simple Material Transfer Agreements, or  Memorandums of Understanding, which allow private industry the initial exploration of the commercial potential of an invention, or more deﬁnitive, Cooperative Research and Development Agreements  CRADA  that specify the role of each party in the commercial development and ownership of the ﬁnal product. Having a private industry partner warrants closer scrutiny of the economic impact of the disease, importance of the disease to be controlled, and the potential for biocontrol to be competitive with the other control measures in terms of efﬁcacy and cost. A CRADA was in the commercialization of BioSavee by essential EcoScience Corp., which is based on P. syringae, and Aspiree by Ecogen-Israel Partnership, Ltd., which is based on C. oleophila. For example, under the CRADA, mass production by fermentation and biomass yield were determined for the P. syringae antagonist ﬁrst, and EcoSciene Corp. registration and formulation of the antagonist. This was followed by joint biocontrol feasibility and up-scale tests under simulated commercial conditions, biocontrol tests with various formu- lations developed by EcoScience Corp., and the pilot test with the ﬁnal formulation. EcoScience Corp. developed safety data and registered the product. Production, marketing, and quality control were conducted by EcoScience Corp. Also, essential for the success of BioSave was the well-developed distribution of the product, skillful technical assistance, and rigorous quality control. This approach could be used as a model for successful public private sector cooperation in the commercialization of other antagonists for BCPD  Stack 1998 .  investigated the potential  for  The commercial development of Avogreen in South Africa, which contains B. subtillis and is applied in the ﬁeld for the control of postharvest diseases of avocado, followed a slightly different path  L. Korsten, personal communication . Once registered, the approach was “to make the system work in the hands of the farmer.” First, growers tested the product on a limited scale and were encouraged to integrate the product with existing copper sprays. By slowly phasing in biocontrol, growers gained conﬁdence in the product. They were provided with technical support to calculate dosages, and develop suitable spray schedules adjusted for their spray equipment, cultivars used, age, and history of their orchards and disease proﬁles. Different formulations were developed to adapt biocontrol to different mixing systems, and for integration with existing chemicals and application methods. Application guidelines were subsequently developed for all possible application systems and for different customer needs. The wettable carrier was found to be more desirable from a production point of view because it sustained excellent cell and biomass densities, had acceptable shelf life, and was more economical. Rigorous quality control has been an integral part throughout the development of this product.  Marketing biological control products requires extensive knowledge in the ﬁelds of biological- and integrated control, production systems, and microbial ecosystems. The effec- tiveness of implementing biocontrol alone or in integrated systems will largely depend on knowledge of the product,  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

These aspects are often neglected in the commercialization of biocontrol.  8 CONCLUSIONS  Work conducted on BCPD demonstrates that in some cases biological control alone can provide adequate decay control, but in others it must be integrated with additional control measures. BCPD is compatible with many alternatives to fungicide treatment, can be easily adapted to current postharvest practices, and be used in a cascade system, where each additional control measure further reduces fruit decay. Recent advances in physiological and genetic the yeast biocontrol agents and the manipulation of development of superior antagonist mixtures that led to signiﬁcant increases in the efﬁcacy of BCPD are only the tip of the iceberg in showing what can be accomplished with the postharvest biocontrol system. They are also indicative that, in the future, there will be additional situations where biocontrol treatment alone will be adequate for the control of postharvest fruit decays. Greater effort is needed to identify circumstances where currently available biocontrol can be used alone. This includes not only replacing a fungicide treatment but also instances where no fungicides are registered for postharvest use and losses due to decay are signiﬁcant, e.g., Botrytis rot on pomegranates designated for processing. There are an increasing number of situations where a fungicide is registered for postharvest use in the United States but not in other countries, particularly in Europe. This may restrict export markets or increase losses if major decay control measures are not implemented for fruit designated for export. In many of these instances, biological control can be an acceptable treatment. Currently, the European Community is sponsoring a large international project on biological control of postharvest diseases of fruits as an alternative to synthetic fungicide treatment after harvest. Experience with the commercial products for BCPD such as Aspiree, Avogreene, and BioSavee, indicate that the fruit industry is receptive to the new control measures and will implement them if they provide adequate control, are cost effective and compatible with current postharvest practices. Continuous expansion of postharvest biocontrol research worldwide and the related successes, even in the most challenging areas such as control of latent infections creates an optimistic picture for the future of BCPD of fruits.

Boyetchko Saskatoon Research Centre, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada  1  INTRODUCTION  Biological control of plant pathogens presents a compelling method of increasing plant yields by suppressing or destroying pathogens, enhancing the ability of plants to resist pathogens, and or protecting plants against pathogens. Micro-organisms antagonistic to plant pathogens may be derived from the resident microbial community or may be of foreign origin. Although there are concerns towards the release of an organism of foreign extraction, in general, biological control presents a myriad of beneﬁts such as being a component of the environment, resistant to development of chemical pesticide resistance, being relatively safe and risk free, and by being compatible with sustainable agriculture. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi  AMF  form one such group of organisms that can act as bioprotectors of plants. These zygomycetous fungi that form specialized structures such as arbuscules and or vesicles are obligate biotrophs and utilize host photosynthates for their growth. They are ubiquitous and co-exist with over 80% of terrestrial plants including agricultural or horticultural crops. Their interactions with rhizosphere ﬂora and fauna inﬂuence the growth and ﬁtness of the associated plants  Azcon-Aguilar and Barea 1992; Fitter and Sanders 1992 . An incompatible association between the host plant and the indigenous AMF community can lead to serious losses in crop yields, indicating the signiﬁcance of AMF in crop production. In contrast, a compatible association can result in enhanced plant productivity, through enhanced host P nutrition  Ravnskov and Jakobsen 1995 , prevention or control of plant diseases caused by soil-borne pathogens  Caron 1989a; St-Arnaud et al. 1995 , and or enhancement of plant hormonal activity  Frankenberger and Arshad 1995 .  The rhizosphere, a zone of soil loosely surrounding the roots, is a dynamic environment wherein complex chemical  and microbiological activities occur  Lynch 1990 . The mycorrhizosphere is the region of the rhizosphere that is subjected to modiﬁcations following AMF colonization of the host plant  Linderman 1988 . Induced biochemical changes in the plant as a result of AMF root colonization is collectively termed the “mycorrhizosphere effect.” The mycorrhizosphere effect typically results in a transient or permanent shift in the resident microbial community that may favor the elimination or proliferation of pathogens  Edwards et al. 1998; Meyer and Linderman 1986; Nemec 1994; Paulitz and Linderman 1989 . In general, these changes are mediated by modiﬁcations in host root membrane permeability that subsequently leads to modiﬁcations in root exudate composition  Graham et al. 1981; Ratnayake et al. 1978 . Meticulous management of the mycorrhizosphere may serve as an effective, safe, and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional methods of plant disease control.  2 EXAMPLES OF AMF-MEDIATED PLANT  DISEASE CONTROL  2.1 Phytopathogenic Fungi  Plant pathogenic fungi contribute signiﬁcantly to crop damage and yield loss, followed by plant pathogenic bacteria and viruses. The potential of AMF to control various plant pathogenic fungi has been clearly demonstrated  Becker et al. 1999; Bodker et al. 2002; Boyetchko and Tewari 1996; Duchesne et al. 1989; Kapoor et al. 1998; Kasiamdari et al. 2002; Kegler and Gottwald 1998; Krishna and Bagyaraj 1983 . In contrast, there are reports wherein AMF inoculation did not have any effect on disease severity  Guillon et al. 2002; Larsen and Bodker 2001; Wyss et al. 1991; Zambolin and Schenck 1983 . In order for practical and routine use of  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   AMF as protectors of plants against plant pathogenic fungi, AMF performance must be consistent, speciﬁc, and effective. Speciﬁcity of AMF for the control of crop diseases is crucial in order to mitigate any nontarget effects to beneﬁcial micro-organisms. However, there are conﬂicting reports on the speciﬁcity of AMF. For example, inoculation of micro- propagated banana with Glomus intraradices and a Glomus spp. isolate reduced rhizome necrosis and external disease symptoms caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense, but differences between the two AMF isolates were not noted, indicating that either both AMF species were equally effective against the pathogen or that they lacked speciﬁcity  Jaizme-Vega et al. 1998 . In contrast, eggplant and cucumber seedlings transplanted into soils inoculated with G. versiforme and subsequently challenged with Verticillium dahliae and Pseudomonas lacrymans alleviated wilt symptoms caused by V. dahliae, but not G. mosseae, Glomus spp.-1, or Glomus spp.-2, indicating species-speciﬁc antagonistic symbiont – pathogen interactions  Li et al. 1997 . Pozo et al.  1999  demonstrated the expression of two new basic glucanase isoforms, a phytoalexin elicitor-releasing factor between G. mosseae and G. intraradices used for the control of Phytophothora parasitica var. nicotianae. Because of the potential of AMF as bioprotectors against phytopathogens, this is an area that needs further study.  In order to enhance AMF efﬁcacy, some researchers have used an AMF species mixture or a combination of micro- organisms including AMF that act in concert to eliminate pathogens. For example, co-inoculation of groundnut with G. fasciculatum, Gigaspora margarita, Acaulospora laevis, and Sclerocystis dussii eliminated the damaging effects of Sclerotium rolfsii  Kulkarni et al. 1997 . Also, tobacco inoculated with a mixture containing G. fasciculatum and Trichoderma harzianum effectively controlled damping-off caused by Pythium aphanidermatum and black shank disease caused by P. parasitica var. nicotianae  Sreeramulu et al. 1998 . In some cases, microbial mixtures act synergistically with pesticides to result in effective control of plant diseases. A combination of wheat straw, carbendazim, G. fasciculatum, and T. viride protected safﬂower seedlings from the root rot pathogen Macrophomina phaseolina, resulting in 100% seedling survival  Prashanthi et al. 1997 . Sharma et al.  1997  effectively managed ginger yellows disease caused by F. oxysporum f. sp. zingiberi using a combination of Gi. margarita, pine needles, and T. harzianum.  The requirement of a fully established AM symbiosis for elicitation of bioprotective activity by AMF has been disputed. The invasion of phytopathogenic fungi is said to be prevented by an aggressively root colonizing AMF species, indicating that AMF root colonization was satisfactory for control of disease. For example, Feldmann and Boyle  1998  found an inverse correlation between G. etunicatum root colonization of begonia cultivars and susceptibility to the foliar pathogen caused by the powdery mildew fungus Erysiphe cichoracearum. However, it was not clear whether G. etunicatum colonization preceded infection by E. cichoracearum or whether pathogen suppression was  accompanied by other mechanisms of biocontrol. Using an in vitro system, Filion et al.  1999  demonstrated that extracts from the extraradical mycelium of G. intraradices reduced the conidial germination of F. oxysporum f. sp. chrysanthemi. Alternatively, alterations in the chemical equilibrium of the mycorrhizosphere may have resulted in pathogen control. In another study, pea mutants defective for mycorrhization and nodulation challenged with Aphano- myces euteiches required a fully established AMF symbiosis for protection against the pathogen  Slezack et al. 2000 .  Several  researchers have also demonstrated AMF- mediated reduction of root rot disease in cereal crops  Boyetchko and Tewari 1988; Grey et al. 1989; Rempel and Bernier 1990; Thompson and Wildermuth 1989  and take-all disease of wheat  Graham and Menge 1982 . Phytophthora spp., which cause diseases in a variety of plants have been model systems for AMF-mediated plant disease control  Cordier et al. 1996; Guillemin et al. 1994; Mark and Cassells 1999; Norman and Hooker 2000; Pozo et al. 1996; Trotta et al. 1996 . Using the AMF species G. intraradices and pathogen F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici on tomato, Caron and co-workers have shown that the growth medium used  Caron et al. 1985 , the application of P  Caron et al. 1986a , and pretreatment of the growth medium with AMF  Caron et al. 1986c  can inﬂuence disease severity. Despite proof of AMF potential in controlling plant diseases, few published reports have successfully demonstrated biological control of plant pathogens by AMF in the ﬁeld  Bodker et al. 2002; Newsham et al. 1995; Torres-Barragan et al. 1996 . Newsham et al.  1995  showed that pre-inoculating the annual grass Vulpia ciliata var. ambigua with an indigenous Glomus sp. and re-introducing the grass into a natural grass population extended a favorable effect against an indigenous F. oxysporum. Onion pretreated with Glomus sp. Zac-19 delayed the development of onion white rot caused by S. cepivorum by two weeks in the ﬁeld and protected onion plants for 11 weeks after transplanting in the ﬁeld and resulted in a yield increase of 22%  Torres-Barragan et al. 1996 . One of the ﬁrst reports on the effect of indigenous AMF on the development of introduced A. euteiches infection and disease development on ﬁeld-grown pea  Bodker et al. 2002  showed that there was no correlation between AMF root colonization and disease incidence or severity, and emphasized the importance of ﬁeld evaluations for authenticating the use of AMF as biocontrol agents. Although the indigenous AMF community composition was not described, this study underscores the importance of a richly diverse indigenous AMF community to defend plants from plant pathogens. Thus, there appears to be tremendous potential for AMF control of plant pathogens and the need for more detailed and well-planned and executed studies that will address problems of inconsistent and unreliable results.  2.2 Plant Pathogenic Bacteria  The AMF interact with functionally diverse bacteria such as diazotrophs, biological control agents, and other common  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   rhizosphere inhabitants  Nemec 1994  that often result in signiﬁcant alterations to plant growth, yield, and nutrition. Interactions between mycorrhizal fungi and bacteria may have detrimental  Filion et al. 1999; Shalaby and Hanna 1998; 2001  or beneﬁcial effects  Edwards et al. 1998; Gryndler and Hrselova 1998; Li et al. 1997; Ravnskov and Jakobsen 1999 , or have no effect at all on the plant pathogenic bacterium  Otto and Winkler 1995 .  Glomus mosseae prevented the infection of soybean plants by P. syringae  Shalaby and Hanna 1998 , by suppressing the population density of the pathogen in soybean rhizosphere. Li et al.  1997  also found that G. macrocarpum reduced the infection caused by P. lacrymans in eggplant and cucumber, although no positive growth or yield effect was noted, indicating tolerance to the pathogen as a possible mode of action. Inoculation of mulberry with G. fasciculatum or G. mosseae in combination with 60 – 90 kg of P per hectare per year reduced the incidence of bacterial blight caused by P. syringae pv. mori  Sharma 1995 . Inoculation of grape- vines with AMF reduced the number of ﬂuorescent pseudomonads on the rhizoplane thereby reducing the incidence of grapevine replant disease  Waschkies et al. 1994 . Similarly, a reduction in the colonization of apple seedling rootlets by actinomycetes causing replant disease was reported, while a proportionate increase in root colonization by AMF was noted  Otto and Winkler 1995 .  2.3 Phytopathogenic Viruses   b  more leaf  Viruses remain the least studied amongst all the plant disease- causing target organisms listed for mycorrhizae-mediated biocontrol. The general response of mycorrhizal plants to the presence of viral pathogens is as follows:  a  mycorrhizal plants apparently enhanced the rate of multiplication of viruses in some plants  Daft and Okusanya 1973; Nemec and Myhre 1984 , lesions were found on mycorrhizal plants than on nonmycorrhizal plants  Scho¨nbeck 1978; Scho¨nbeck and Dehne 1979 , and  c  the number of AMF spores in the rhizosphere was reduced considerably  Jayaraman et al. 1995; Nemec and Myhre 1984 . Enhanced viral multiplication and activity in mycorrhizal plants is speculated to be attributed to higher P levels compared to nonmycorrhizal plants. A similar effect was noted in nonmycorrhizal plants fertilized with P  Daft and Okasanya 1973; Shaul et al. 1999 . Some workers found that host plants were more susceptible to AMF colonization following infection by a virus. For example, Scho¨nbeck and Spengler  1979  reported that following the inoculation of tobacco  Nicotiana mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal glutinosa L.  with tobacco mosaic virus  TMV , mycorrhizal plants exhibited higher levels of AMF colonization. In contrast, mung bean yellow mosaic bigeminivirus reduced the AMF colonization and yield of mycorrhizal plants  Jayaraman et al. 1995 , while lack of response to viral infection by a mycorrhizal host was also demonstrated  Takahashi et al. 1994 . Early studies using electron  microscopy revealed that mycorrhizae were not viral vectors because virus particles were absent in the AMF hyphae and around arbuscules, suggesting that AMF did not interact with viruses  Jabaji-Hare and Stobbs 1984 . Thus, potential for the biocontrol of plant pathogenic viruses using mycorrhizae does not appear to be promising. However, it may be worthwhile to investigate the role of viruses in the reduction of mycorrhizal colonization and related host plant effects.  3 MODES OF MYCORRHIZAE-MEDIATED  DISEASE CONTROL  3.1 Host Nutritional Effects  3.1.1  Improved Plant Nutrition  Mycorrhizal plants are generally able to tolerate pathogens and compensate for root damage and photosynthate drain by pathogens  Azcon-Aguilar and Barea 1992; Declerck et al. 2002 , because AMF enhance host nutrition and overall plant growth. For example, Declerck et al.  2002  found that G. proliferum and a Glomus sp. isolate not only stimulated growth and increased shoot P content of banana in the presence and absence of the root rot fungus Cylindrocladium spathiphylli, but also reduced root damage by the pathogen, indicating direct interactions between the AMF and the pathogen. In contrast, some reports indicate that AMF are capable of biological control activity  Boyetchko and Tewari 1988; Grey et al. 1989; Rempel and Bernier 1990 . It is believed that AMF interact equally with host plants, but in fact AMF prefer one host or host cultivar over another, as shown by Grey et al.  1989  who reported that mycorrhizal barley cultivar WI2291 not only exhibited greater control of the barley common root rot pathogen Bipolaris sorokiniana than a mycorrhizal cultivar Harmal, but also produced signiﬁcantly higher yields. On the other hand, biological control activity is dependent on the AMF species as demonstrated for common root rot of barley by Boyetchko and Tewari root colonization by natural AMF communities occurring in ﬁeld soils has an inverse relationship with B. sorokiniana infection, indicating not only a direct interaction between the AMF and the pathogen, but also an AMF-mediated improvement in host nutrition  Thompson and Wildermuth 1989 . In contrast, there are also reports suggesting a lack of interaction between AMF and B. sorokiniana under ﬁeld conditions  Wani et al. 1991 . Interaction between naturally occurring AMF and pathogens or the lack thereof in the ﬁeld likely depends on the distribution of the organisms particularly under the different crop rotations. Signiﬁcant reductions in disease severity as a result of AMF colonization and enhanced P uptake followed by modiﬁcations in root exudation patterns has also been reported for take-all disease of wheat  Graham and Menge 1982 . Improvement in host P nutrition is one of the earliest proposed mechanisms of AMF-mediated pathogen or disease tolerance that is still very pertinent.   1992 . There are suggestions that  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   3.1.2 Tolerance to Pathogen  Arbuscular fungi are known to enhance plant tolerance to pathogens without excessive yield losses, and in some cases, enhance pathogen inoculum density. This compensation is apparently related to enhanced photosynthetic capacity  Abdalla and Abdel-Fattah 2000; Heike et al. 2001; Karajeh and Al-Raddad 1999  and a delay in senescence caused by the pathogen, which cancels the positive relationship between disease severity and yield loss  Heike et al. 2001 . For example, soybean plants grown in the soil infested with M. phaseolina, Rhizoctonia solani, or F. solani exhibited lower shoot and root weight and plant height compared to control plants in soil not infested with the pathogens or with G. mosseae  Zambolin and Schenck 1983 . The incidence of infection by the pathogens was not affected by G. mosseae colonization but the mycorrhizal plants were able to tolerate infection of pathogens better than nonmycorrhizal plants. The efﬁcacy and efﬁciency of AMF in promoting plant growth enables mycorrhizal plants to tolerate pathogens, as demonstrated by Hwang  1988  using alfalfa challenged with P. paroecandrum and Karajeh and Al-Raddad  1999  using olive seedlings. It is unclear whether mycorrhizal alfalfa tolerated P. paroecandrum or if other additional mechanisms were involved. Despite the presence of a pathogen beneﬁts of AMF to susceptible hosts can occur until a pathogen inoculum threshold level, beyond which no AMF-mediated beneﬁts can be realized  Stewart and Pﬂeger 1977 . On the other hand, high tissue P levels in mycorrhizal plants may not only improve vigor and ﬁtness of the plant but also modify pathogen dynamics in the mycorrhizosphere by modifying root exudation  Davis and Menge 1980; 1981; Kaye et al. 1984 .  Tolerance of the plant to a pathogen can vary depending on the AMF species and their ability for enhancing host nutrition and growth, although some ineffective AMF species reduce pathogen entry by triggering a defense reaction in plants  Davis and Menge 1981 . For example, Matsubara et al.  2000  noted that there were signiﬁcant differences in the ability of Gi. margarita, G. fasciculatum, G. mosseae, and Glomus sp. R10 to not only enhance asparagus growth but also in their ability to tolerate the severity of violet root rot caused by Helicobasidium mompa. Asparagus seedlings inoculated with Glomus sp. R10 had the lowest incidence of violet root rot. This important fact highlights the care that needs to be exercised in the selection of AMF species for biological control of diseases.  3.1.3 Qualitative and Quantitative Alterations in  Pathogen Biomass  Modiﬁcations in root exudate composition following changes in host root membrane permeability as a result of AMF colonization  Graham et al. 1981  can enforce changes in the rhizosphere microbial equilibrium  Brejda et al. 1998; Edwards et al. 1998; Kaye et al. 1984; Meyer and Linderman 1986 . Changes in the rhizosphere microﬂoral community can  collectively beneﬁt host plants by creating favorable conditions for the proliferation of microﬂora antagonistic to pathogens such as Phytophthora and Pythium spp. as shown for eucalyptus seedlings by Malajczuk and McComb  1979 . Unfavorable conditions induced by AMF colonization resulted in qualitative changes in the mycorrhizosphere that prevented P. cinnamoni sporangial induction in tomato plants  Meyer and Linderman 1986 . Proliferation of G. mosseae inside grapevine roots was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in replant disease-causing ﬂuorescent pseudomonad inoculum in soil  Waschkies et al. 1994 . Promoting AMF diversity that will ensure that at least a component of the AMF community may be active against pathogens can further enhance the beneﬁts of this mechanism.  3.2 Competition  The AMF spores in soil are not known to compete for nutrients as spore reserves are utilized for survival until root contact is achieved. Following root entry, competition can occur for infection sites, host photosynthates, and root space  Smith and Read 1997 . Competition between AMF and pathogens can be used for physical exclusion of pathogen  Davis and Menge 1980; Hussey and Roncadori 1982; Smith 1988 , if the host is preinoculated with AMF. Simultaneous colonization of AMF and the pathogen may not provide a competitive edge for AMF for inoculum build-up  Daniels and Menge 1980  because of its relatively slow growth rate compared with the pathogen. In contrast, some others have noted that competition may not occur between AMF and other organisms  Sempavalan et al. 1995 . Competition, as a mechanism of suppressing pathogens by AMF did not receive much consideration, because in some cases pathogens were suppressed even in noncolonized root portions that was later described as induced resistance by AMF  Pozo et al. 1999 . In addition, inconsistencies with regard to prerequisites and AMF effects on pathogens have contributed to a lack of interest.  3.3 Physiological and Biochemical Alterations of  the Host  Following AMF colonization, host root tissue P levels are typically enhanced which modify the phospholipid compo- sition and therefore the root membrane permeability resulting in a reduction in the leakage of net amount of sugars, carboxylic acids, and aminoacids into the rhizosphere  Graham and Menge 1982; Ratnayake et al. 1978; Schwab et al. 1983 . These alterations arrest the chemotactic effect of pathogens to plant roots and discourage pathogen entry. Prior inoculation of maize plants with G. mosseae decreased the number of Alternaria alternata colony forming units, but when both organisms were inoculated at the same time, there was no effect on pathogen inoculum density in soil  McAllister et al. 1996 . It is possible that the G. mosseae  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   symbiont altered membrane permeability of the host roots, thereby reducing the quality and quantity of substances exuded by the roots  Graham et al. 1981 , restricting pathogen propagule germination, indicating that the timing of inoculation can enhance biocontrol activity.  3.3.1 Systemic-induced Resistance  Systemic-induced resistance  SIR  is typically the sustained induction of resistance or tolerance to disease in plants by previously inoculating with a pathogen, exposing to an environmental inﬂuence or treating with a chemical, which may or may not have antimicrobial activity  Handelsman and Stabb 1996; Kuc 1995 . Researchers have suggested that AMF-inoculated plants may employ SIR as a mechanism of biocontrol  Benhamou et al. 1994; Brendan et al. 1996; Trotta et al. 1996 . The SIR phenomenon in mycorrhizal plants is demonstrated as localized and systemic resistance to the pathogen  Cordier et al. 1998 . An increase in the lignin deposition in plant cell walls following AMF colonization can restrict the spread of pathogens  Dehne and Scho¨nbeck 1979 . Using a split root system, Cordier et al.  1998  demonstrated that G. mosseae protected tomato plants against P. parasitica by reducing pathogen development and spread by increasing cell wall appositions containing callose close to the intercellular hyphae and accumulation of phenolic compounds and plant cell defense responses. Root damage was observed in portions of mycorrhizal root systems not containing mycorrhizal structures. The SIR reaction to the pathogen in mycorrhizal plants was further illustrated by host wall thickenings containing nonesteriﬁed pectins and pathogenesis related  PR -1 protein in the nonmycorrhizal areas of the roots. They also noted that the PR-1 protein was found only in the pathogen-invaded tissues of pea. These responses were observed in the nonmycorrhizal pathogen-infected root tissues that ultimately led to cell death. Bodker et al.  1998  reported that the observed increased resistance to A. euteiches in G. intraradices-inoculated pea was probably due to an “induced systemic factor,” induced by G. intraradices. The AMF-mediated SIR phenomenon is speculated to play a role in the protection of potatoes against post-harvest suppression of potato dry rot, wherein dry rot in G. intraradix-inoculated potato was reduced by up to 90% compared to uninoculated control  Brendan et al. 1996 . This ﬁnding suggests that the beneﬁts of AMF inoculation for disease control surpasses the growth and reproduction phase of the host and extends to the storage phase of the product. The area of SIR response in mycorrhizal plants is still developing and several aspects including whether all AMF species can equally elicit a SIR response in the host are not known.  Some researchers have examined the role of PR proteins in the disease control process mediated by AMF  Liu et al. 1995 . Enhanced levels of 10 different PR proteins were detected in cotton plants inoculated with G. mosseae, G. versiforme, or Scl. sinuosa challenged with V. dahliae compared with plants not challenged by the pathogen. The PR proteins retarded the hyphal growth of V. dahliae and killed  their conidia. This appears to be a promising ﬁeld that can be used for the effective control of plant diseases.  3.3.2 Phytoalexins and Phytoanticipins  Phytoalexins are produced in response to microbial infection  Paxton 1981 , whereas phytoanticipins are stored in plant cells in anticipation of or prior to pathogen attack  VanEtten et al. 1995 . The level of phytoalexins elicited by pathogens has been shown to be much higher than those elicited by symbiotic organisms  Wyss et al. 1991 . The function of an isoﬂavonoid molecule as a phytoalexin or phytoanticipin can be predicted based on the cellular location of the molecule  Stafford 1992 .  An increase in the level of total soluble plant phenolics such as isoﬂavonoids or ﬂavonoids, lignin, syringic, ferulic or coumaric acids, etc. have been reported as synthesis of phytoalexins following AMF colonization of roots  Harrison and Dixon 1993; Morandi 1989; 1996 . Some ﬂavonoids that are not true phytoalexins may also respond to AMF colonization of roots  Harrison and Dixon 1993; Morandi and Le-Quere 1991; Volpin et al. 1995 .  The production of phytoalexins as a result of pathogen invasion in mycorrhizal plants has been explored. Tomato plants inoculated with G. mosseae posed greater resistance to the pathogen F. oxysporum and were found to have increased phenylalanine and b-glucosidase activity and total phenol content in their roots compared to plants inoculated with either organism alone  Dehne and Schonbeck 1979 . Sundaresan et al.  1993  reported that a puriﬁed ethanol fraction of mycorrhizal cowpea root extract inhibited F. oxysporum in vitro. However, the isoﬂavonoid was not identiﬁed. Production of phytoalexins in mycorrhizal plants appears to be independent of the effect of fertilizer addition  Caron et al. 1986b . In general, in the presence or absence of pathogens in plant roots, phytoalexins are induced in mycorrhizal plants that neutralize the negative effects of pathogens.  3.3.3 Hydrolases  Differential expression of defense-related genes in mycorrhizal plants has been the recent focus of AMF- mediated biocontrol  Blee and Anderson 1996; Dumas- Gaudot et al. 1996; Lambais and Mehdy 1995; Pozo et al. 2002 . Researchers have shown that AMF enter into host  e.g., tomato  roots and induce a local, weak, and transient activation of the host defence mechanism against pathogens such as P. parasitica, which involves the induction of hydrolytic chitosanase, b-glucanase, and superoxide dismutase  Pozo et al. 2002 . In addition, portions of the mycorrhizal root system not containing mycorrhizal structures appear to have alterations in the constitutive isoforms of the enzymes indicating systemic changes following AMF colonization  Pozo et al. 2002 . A high positive correlation between the level of glucanase activity in host tissues and pathogen resistance has  chitinase,  enzymes  such as  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   been established  Graham and Graham 1991 . Further studies examining the role of these glucanases will help in the development of strategies for control of pathogens using AMF.  3.4 Antibiosis  Reports on the production of antimicrobial substances by AMF are not common. However, recently, it was shown that antimicrobial substances  unidentiﬁed  produced by the extraradical mycelium of the AMF species G. intraradices reduced conidial germination of F. oxysporum f. sp. chrysanthemi, which was independent of changes in pH  Filion et al. 1999 . Budi et al.  1999  isolated a Paenibacillus sp. strain from the mycorrhizosphere of Sorghum bicolor plants inoculated with G. mosseae that exhibited signiﬁcant antagonism against P. parasitica. Regardless of the source of these biocontrol activities, it is important to realize and utilize the signiﬁcance of AMF in plant disease control. Additional research in this are may prove to be fruitful in the control of pathogenic bacteria and fungi.  4 CHALLENGES AND STRATEGIES TO ENHANCING ARBUSCULAR FUNGAL EFFICACY IN DISEASE CONTROL  4.1 Challenges  Although the efﬁcacy of an AMF species on plant pathogens has been assessed under controlled environments and usually in the absence of other AMF or other organisms  Budi et al. 1999; Kasuya et al. 1996; Li et al. 1997 , research indicates that the potential of AMF for control of plant pathogens is high. Limitations in AMF research pertaining to biological control of plant diseases under ﬁeld conditions are two fold,  a  production of large quantities of AMF inoculum is not feasible because of the obligate biotrophicity status of AMF, and  b  negative interactions between the introduced AMF and the indigenous AMF and microbial community after introduction into ﬁeld. Challenges posed by interactions between AMF and indigenous microbial community and soil and environmental conditions often determine the success of AMF inoculation in disease control under ﬁeld conditions. An appreciation of inﬂuence AMF efﬁcacy as biological control agents can further enhance their survival, competitiveness and efﬁcacy. For example, it is known that intraradical proliferation of AMF within roots is a host- regulated event  Bever et al. 1996 . Therefore, a highly mycotrophic host or host cultivar may be more favorable for AMF proliferation and reproduction than one that is not highly mycotrophic  Feldmann and Boyle 1998; Xavier 1999 . In addition, nonconducive soil-environment combi- nations such as high soil P levels and soil disturbance can affect AMF colonization  Bever et al. 1996; Gazey et al. 1992; Stahl et al. 1988; Stutz and Morton 1996  and efﬁcacy  factors that   Graham et al. 1981; Menge et al. 1978; Ratnayake et al. 1978 . Colonization of host roots by AMF is a crucial component in the AMF-mediated SIR response of host plants to plant pathogens as the expression of an SIR response requires a threshold level AMF presence within host roots  Cordier et al. 1996; 1998 . The effect of phosphorus on AMF efﬁcacy may be direct, wherein inoptimum P levels impair AMF activity and therefore its ability to effectively control pathogens. In contrast, soil disturbance has an indirect effect where AMF efﬁcacy may be altered by a delay in mycelial network initiation and diversion of carbon for the synthesis or repair of the external mycelial network and not nutrient uptake. Zak et al.  1982  suggested that the ability of AMF to effectively re-establish their mycorrhizal association after disturbance might partially determine their success in a disturbed site. It is not known to what extent soil disturbance affects the biocontrol activities of AMF, but it disrupts the external mycelial network resulting in a severe reduction in mycorrhizal efﬁcacy  Evans and Miller 1990; Stahl et al. 1988 .  A richly diverse AMF community ensures qualitatively and quantitatively the presence of AMF species desired for speciﬁc activities such as biological control of plant pathogens. However, choice of host genotype and rotation  Bever et al. 1996; Johnson et al. 1992; Talukdar and Germida 1993 , levels of fertilizer application  Baltruschat and Dehne 1982; Jasper et al. 1979; McGonigle and Miller 1993; 1996; Vivekanandan and Fixen 1991 , tillage  Evans and Miller 1990; McGonigle and Miller 1993; Vivekanandan and Fixen 1991 , pesticide application  Manjunath and Bagyaraj 1984; Schreiner and Bethlenfalvay 1997 , and the effect of associated micro-organisms  Andrade et al. 1995; Xavier and Germida 2002  are some critical factors that can indirectly alter AMF diversity in soils. For example, continuous cropping selectively enhances the proliferation of parasitic AMF, which are relatively fast growing compared to beneﬁcial AMF, leading to alterations in mycorrhizal biodiversity in the rhizosphere  Johnson et al. 1992 . Similarly, one particular AMF host selects from an indigenous AMF pool resulting in the selective enrichment of certain AMF species over others  Xavier 1999 . Studies assessing the signiﬁcance of AMF biodiversity in AMF-mediated biocontrol are rare but critical. Given the importance of AMF to plant health and the complexity of the various microbial interactions, all the relevant factors have to be considered before AMF selected as biocontrol agents can effectively function in the ﬁeld.  4.2 Strategies  Biological control of plant diseases by AMF under ﬁeld conditions is the effect of interactions between AMF and various groups of organisms in the rhizosphere. Sikora  1997  proposed “biological system management,” a holistic approach for root systems that adopts  improving plant  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   speciﬁc cultural practices that promote plant defense mechanisms such as tolerance and or resistance to pathogens, and the use of organisms that are antagonistic towards pathogens and that target sensitive developmental stages of pathogens. This approach offers a viable alternative to integrated pest management and inundative approaches such as the application of high levels of microbial inocula to the nonrhizosphere soil for biological control purposes, and underscores the signiﬁcance of mycorrhizae in root health  Sikora 1997 .  4.2.1 Enhanced AMF Biodiversity  A diverse AMF community contains a mycorrhizal assemblage and species abundance that naturally aid the host to endure adverse conditions to ultimately enhance plant growth. Research shows that inclusion of host crops  Bever et al. 1996; Johnson et al. 1992  and or cultivars that exhibit high mycorrhizal responsiveness can signiﬁcantly improve AMF functioning  Boyetchko and Tewari 1995; Xavier and Germida 1998 . Therefore, rotation of crops that are dependent on mycorrhizae will ensure early AMF root colonization and high sporulation of even the most sensitive AMF species in soil. Minimal disturbance to the soil also guarantees early contact between an emerging seedling and the AMF hyphal network in soil that distributes nutrients and initiate early colonization of AMF propagules in soil. Excessive fertilizer and pesticide use can alter plant chemistry and cause changes in AMF assemblage and abundance, resulting in a poor AMF community that does not beneﬁt the host  Gazey et al. 1992; Jasper et al. 1979; Johnson et al. 1992 . Caution in the choice of cultural practices that potentially alter AMF diversity would prove to be fruitful.  4.2.2  Improved Understanding of Microbial  AMF  Ecology and Ecosystem Functioning  It is common knowledge that AMF functioning in natural ecosystems can be altered by various factors including interactions with other organisms. However, speciﬁcs on the topic are lacking. Knowledge generated from studies addressing AMF efﬁcacy in a typical rhizosphere community, under moisture and salinity stress and soil disturbance, in soils containing extreme indigenous AMF levels, and in the presence of antagonizers is required for the development of effective AMF biocontrol agents.  4.2.3 Selection of Effective AMF  Bagyaraj  1984  suggested that AMF species selection for a desired activity must be based on their ability for survival, aggressive colonization of host roots, and efﬁcacy. Use of AMF species originally isolated from test host roots has proven advantageous for many plant species including agricultural crops, forest tree species, and orchard crops   Reena and Bagyaraj 1990a,b; Talukdar and Germida 1994; Vinayak and Bagyaraj 1990 . Screening procedures must include selection pressure similar to that in which the AMF will be applied.  resistance responses in plants.  Research shows that plant pathogens can be controlled not only by the use of biocontrol agents, but also by the induction of Inoculating plants with AMF has been shown to induce resistance in plants. Such plant immunizations are a viable approach for transplant crops because of the ease of AMF inoculation, while more innovative methods are required with direct- sown crops.  4.2.4 Superior Application Technology  Research shows that “priming” plants against pathogens using selective AMF inocula  or plant immunization  helps protect plants by inducing a SIR response  Cordier et al. 1998 . The inoculum may be applied to seeds, transplanted crops, or plantlets produced through tissue culture before being transplanted into pathogen-infested ﬁelds. Application of the agent prior to transplanting eliminates the need for complex formulations and application techniques, guarantees “targeted placement,” and greater biocontrol activity, reduces costs associated with application and has a minimal impact on the environment  Boyetchko 1996; Glass 1993 . Inoculum may include one or more AMF species or other organisms such as bacteria or that exhibit sustained and coordinated biocontrol activity. The application of a multiple agent mixture may concurrently confer control for more than one plant disease by more than one mechanism rather than single inoculants targeted for control of only one plant disease or pathogen. Application of two or more biocontrol agents targeting different life stages of a pathogen may also be more effective than sequential application of the biocontrol agents. In some instances, augmenting soil with organic amendments such as forest humus and charcoal compost has enabled a signiﬁcant reduction in disease severity  Kobayashi 1993; Wei et al. 1987 .  fungi  5 CONCLUSIONS  Literature presents a wealth of evidence to indicate potential for AMF-mediated control of plant diseases. Although there are challenges in the form of noncultur- ability of AMF and therefore mass multiplication for agricultural crops, there is promise for nondirect sown crops, which is currently undervalued and underexploited. The AMF, by increasing crop productivity using existing resources, avoiding resistance development to chemicals, maintaining pollution and risk-free disease control, and conforming to sustainable agricultural practices, offers more than mere plant disease control. In the future, mycorrhizo- sphere management must become one of the viable and ecosystem friendly solutions to managing plant diseases and reducing pathogen inoculum.

Expected beneﬁts include increase in the efﬁciency of crop production, reduction in agrochemical inputs, and an evaluation of the safety and bioethical aspects in relation to public acceptability. High productivity agriculture exacts a high cost in terms of energy and the environment. Typically, fertilizer and pesticides are used at high levels in the intensive production of plants. More than 150 years of over cultivation with synthetic fertilizers and pesticides has left our soils depleted of the natural biota needed to facilitate the growth of crops. A less costly and nondestructive means of achieving high productivity rests on a establishment of the viable low input farming system. However, to implement such a plan, we must develop plant systems that can efﬁciently scavenge and utilize soil nutrients present at low levels. The judicious use of nature’s own biofertilizers by their biotechnological applications appears to be a suitable answer to this problem. Role of biotechnology in sustainable agriculture can offer a great help towards modern agriculture improvement. In the present review, we have discussed the role of biotechnology, potential biofertilizers with special reference to mycorrhizal biofertilizers, their so far reported synergies, mycorrhizal potential and methodo- logies for its mass multiplication, different constraints in its commercialization and its future role in achieving sustainable agriculture.  Biotechnology has been deﬁned as the integrated use of biological, physical, and engineering sciences to achieve technological application of biological systems. The goal of  technological application implies a direct relevance to commercialization for mass multiplication of the invented bio-product so as to reach the masses. It is encouraging that both, government and industry are becoming more responsive to natural approaches to growing environmental problems. Individuals and organizations worldwide are coming to realize that excessive use of chemical fertilizers can negatively impact water quality and the environment as a whole. The joint effort, if addressed properly, may lead to a healthy environment for future generations.  Biofertilizers include environment-friendly fertilizers with organisms such as:  a  Rhizobium strains for legumes,  b  Azotobacter strains for nonlegume crops,  c  VAM strains for use in agriculture, horticulture, and plantation crops, and  d  phosphorus solubilizing bacteria  PSB  – phosphorus dis- solving bacteria strains. Most common among these are symbiotic mycorrhiza, Rhizobium members and cyano- phyceae group, which deliver plant nutrition, disease resistance, and tolerance to adverse soil and climatic conditions. Biofertilizers also known as microbial inoculants may be involved in symbiotic and associative microbial activities with higher plants. They are natural mini-fertilizer factories that are an economical and safer source of plant nutrition and can increase agricultural production and improve soil fertility. They have great potential as a supplementary, renewable, and environment-friendly source of plant nutrients and are important components of any integrated plant nutrient system. Research on biofertilizers has focussed on biological N2 ﬁxation, plant growth promoting bacteria  PGPR’ B  and phosphorus solubilizing microbes  Hegde et al. 1999 . Research and development activities involved in this demanding but unexplored ﬁeld  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

During the last decade the phenomenal increase in the production and promotion of biofertilizers in agriculture has been the result of special attention given by the government and interest by entrepreneurs in setting up biofertilizer production facilities. Farmers have also realized the beneﬁts of biofertilizers. For ensuring the rapid growth of biofertilizer usage, constant research support is critical, as it will provide the latest information on improvements of their production technology, applications under different agro-climatic con- ditions and help in standardizing handling and storage norms. The role of biofertilizers like arbuscular mycorrhizal  AM  fungi in the growth and multiplication of crop plant can prove to be the most effective alternative to fertilizers for enhancing growth and biomass production. Its application has additional beneﬁts like improved vigor and nutrient uptake, disease resistance, and drought tolerance. The economic surplus is used to assess the impact on the overall economic growth and its contribution to economic efﬁciency and environmental security.  2 MYCORRHIZAL ASSOCIATIONS  fungi Mycorrhizal associations include many taxas of belonging to members of Zygomycetes, Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes and Deutromycetes. A characteristic feature of these fungi is that they are generally widespread in soils, exhibit a strong biotrophic dependence on their host plants, and are rarely free living saprophytes. Different types of mycorrhiza are classiﬁed into seven different categories on the basis of the extent of root penetration. Among them arbuscular mycorrhizas are the most common and have gained tremendous importance in present day agriculture. The AM symbiosis is the association between fungi of the order Glomales  Zygomycetes  and the roots of terrestrial plants  Harley and Smith 1983 . Conservative estimates predict that this ancient symbiosis, dating back to the early Devonian age  398 million years ago , occurs in approximately 90% of the Earth’s land plants  Remy et al. 1994 . The AM symbiosis is increasingly gaining recognition as an important integral component of natural ecosystems throughout the world. The AM fungus – plant association is a mutually beneﬁcial event: the plant supplies the fungus with carbon  from its ﬁxed photosynthates  while the fungal symbiont assists the plant in phosphate uptake and also converts some unavailable mineral nutrients to available forms for the plant. This bidirectional exchange of nutrients takes place through extensively branched haustoria, commonly called arbuscules. In addition to the nutrient uptake, mycorrhizal improve the performance also of other beneﬁcial microbes, help in resisting root pathogens, and increase the tolerance to extremes of environmental and biological stress. With increased nutritional consumption and a higher uptake of desirable nutrients due to mycorrhization, the biomass, both  fungi  above and below the ground, increases. Decomposed biomass, when recycled, improves the soil fertility manifold and this is how mycorrhiza helps in restoring ecosystems.  Above-ground plant development is inﬂuenced by below- ground microbial activity. In the presence of mycorrhizal fungi, other micro-organisms such as PSB, many free-living nitrogen-ﬁxing organisms and Rhizobium work more efﬁciently, fertility and plant growth. Mycorrhizas remain in the soil and form active links with growing plants and mutually beneﬁt each other.  improving soil   Findlay and Kendle 2001 .  Papers advocating the valuable potential of mycorrhizal inoculations in plant establishments have been published since the 1960s but comprehensive information on their practical exploitation by multiple ﬁeld trials has not been presented so far Immense potential of mycorrhiza has not been so far exploited due to its uncultivable nature unlike other biofertilizers. Mycorrhizas are conventionally propagated using pot-based methods with host trap plants. The disadvantage of this mode is the low recovery of mycorrhizal propagules, contamination by saprobes, pathogens and other mycorrhizal fungi because of improper management techniques and long gaps duration between setup and harvest. Several alternatives to this mode have been designed, but in all current methodologies of cultivating AM fungi, host plant is indispensable. Many variants of these methods have been proposed by various workers to culture glomalean endomycorrhizal fungi, with a bewildering array of claims and counterclaims. These will be described in detail in the present review. All of these involve a plant host, either intact or as root explants. Methodological differences focus mainly on differences in the cultural environment, the most dramatic being the interface between fungus, plant root, and external matrix. The various modes include pot base techniques, hydroponic ﬁlms  Elmes et al. 1984  or in aeroponic mist chambers  Hung and Sylvia 1988  and the recent in vitro root organ culture  ROC  system  Becard and Fortin 1988 .  2.1 Pot-Based Techniques  The traditional and most widely used approach has been to grow fungus with a host plant in a solid growth medium consisting of one or a combination of the solid growth media such as soil, sand, peat, vermiculite, perlite, clay, or various types of composted barks. The mycorrhizal inoculum has not been conveniently mass-produced by traditional sand-based pot culture techniques and different micro-organisms frequently contaminate it. In addition, the volume and weight of the inoculum produced by solid growth cultures was sometimes too large and bulky to carry and utilize  Wang and Tschen 1994 . Alternative particle size distributions of substrates vary the inoculum production, the ideal substrate proposed for optimum production is proposed to be low in nutrients and carbon  Gaur and Adholeya 2000 .  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   2.2 Aeroponic Culture Techniques  It is a soil-less plant culture system in which nutrient solutions are intermittently or continuously misted onto plant roots. This system allows efﬁcient production of AM fungi, free of a physical substrate. The colonized root material can be resulting in inocula with very high propagule sheared, densities. Furthermore, large quantities of spores can be obtained from the culture system. Aeroponic culture has worked well for several species of Glomus. It typically takes 12 – 15 weeks to obtain an inoculum. There is a 3-week “inoculation phase,” followed by 9 weeks of aeroponic culture for colonized roots or 12 weeks for spore formation. This also has many disadvantages, because the system is also open to other undesirable microbes, which may harbor and propagate along side. Also, the assembly is huge and requires a lot of space; and regular monitoring of the nutrient solution and its ﬂow is required.  2.3 Root Organ Culture Technique  The ROC system is the most attractive cultivation it uses root-inducing transfer- methodology for research; DNA-transformed roots of a host plant to develop the symbiosis on a speciﬁc medium in vitro  Becard and Fortin 1988 . The pathogenic condition known as “hairy root” occurs due to the transfer of root inducing Ri-plasmid from the bacterium Agrobacterium rhizogenes  Schenck 1992 . These techniques, though challenging have proved useful additions to our knowledge for various aspects of the AM fungal-host symbiosis  Douds 1997 . The problem of producing inoculum in bulk is addressed by the ROC of AM isolates, which provides pure, viable, contamination-free inoculum using less space and thus has an edge over the conventional mode of pot-culture multiplication. Pioneering work on in vitro cultures was initiated in the early 1960s  Chabot et al. 1992 . The use of Ri T-DNA transformed roots of Daucus carrota as host by A. rhizogenes has permitted an increase in spore production of Glomus mosseae  Mugnier and Mosse 1987 . Only few fungal species have being successfully grown using ROC mode such as Gigaspora margarita, Glomus fasciculatum, and G. macrocarpum, G. intraradices, Gigaspora gigantia, G. versiforme, G. caledonium, G. clarum, G. ﬁstulosum, and G. etunicatum  Chabot et al. 1992; Declerck et al. 1996a,b; Declerck et al. 1998; Diop et al. 1992; Douds and Becard 1993; Gryndler et al. 1998; Karandashov et al. 2000; Pawlowska et al. 1999; Souza and Barbara 1999 . Though process of bringing them is very difﬁcult, but the list of the new species under in vitro is increasing every day. Mass production of spores is prerequisite and mathematical models may be useful as descriptive and predictive tools of sporulation dynamics  Declerck et al. 2001 . This mode of culturing AM fungi also provides an opportunity for biochemical and molecular investigations of AM symbiosis, which are otherwise unclear.  Isolation and inoculum production of ectomycorrhiza  EM  and AM fungi present very different problems. Many EM fungi can be cultured on artiﬁcial media. Therefore, isolates of EM can be obtained by placing surface-disinfected portions of sporocarps or mycorrhizal short roots on growth medium. The resulting fungal biomass can be used directly as inoculum but, for ease of use, inoculum often consists of the fungal material mixed with a carrier or bulking material such as peat. They can now be produced in a fermentor and by entrapping the mycelium in alginate beads  Le Tacon et al. 1985; Mauperin et al. 1987 . Obtaining isolates of AM fungi is more difﬁcult because they will not grow apart from their hosts. Spores can be sieved from soil, surface disinfected, and used to initiate “pot cultures” on a susceptible host plant in sterile soil or an artiﬁcial plant-growth medium. Inoculum is typically produced in scaled-up pot cultures. Alternatively, hydroponic or aeroponic culture systems are possible; a beneﬁt of these systems is that plants can be grown without a supporting substrate, allowing colonized roots to be sheared into an inoculum of high propagule number.  3 BENEFITS OF MYCORRHIZAL  INOCULATION  The practical application of mycorrhiza in agriculture is relatively new, though its importance has been evident for some 400 million years. The unique advantage of mycorrhizal organisms is that they not only survive in the most stressful environments but also make the plant to do so. The role of mycorrhiza in land reclamation is most recognized these days. Application of mycorrhizal biofertilizer provides a most desirable solution to many such environmental problems. These phosphate-solubilizing biofertilizers are suggested as an alternative or supplements to chemical fertilizers. Some of the beneﬁts offered by mycorrhizal fungi to plants and general soil health improvement are listed below. However, these are not discussed in detail in the present review:  a  Alleviation of nutrient stress. Under deﬁciency conditions, mycorrhizal fungi can increase nutrient uptake. They facilitate the uptake of nutrients such as phosphorus. Difference among arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi  AMF  for plant P acquisition has also been associated with differences in development and function of hyphae like intraradical and extraradical mycelia  Boddington and Dodd 1998; 1999 . Many immobile trace elements such as N, S, Ca, Mg, K, Zn, Cu, etc, are also known thus providing better nutrition to the host plant  Clark 1997; Persad-Chinnery and Chinnery 1996 . Several reviews are available on the enhanced acquisition of mineral nutrients in plants with mycorrhization  Clark 1997; George et al. 1994; Smith and Read 1997 . Turnau et al.  1993  proposed that polyphos- phates in the fungal hyphae could sequester metals and minimize transfer to roots of the mycorrhizal plants in  b  Enhancement of rooting and stressed conditions, reduction of transplant shock. Mycorrhizal fungi stimulate root production and dramatically increase the volume of soil  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   the plant can explore. This is especially important on disturbed sites, where nutrients and water availability might otherwise inhibit plant growth,  c  Alleviation of drought stress. The increased root volume allows more water to be taken up. Mycorrhizal fungi also enhance the host’s osmotic adjusting capabilities, allowing some plants to continue extracting water from soils as they become drier  Ellis et al. 1985; Morte et al. 2000 ,  d  Stabilization and aggregation of soil. Mycorrhizal fungi encircle soil particles and glue larger soil particles together into aggregates. This increases the surface absorbing area of roots 10 to 100 times. They release powerful chemicals in the form of exudates into the soil that dissolve the hard to capture tightly bound soil nutrients. This improves soil structure, producing humic compounds and organic “glues” that bind soils into aggregates and improve soil porosity, increasing air and water movement though the soil while reducing erodibility. Reports are also available suggesting the presence of a protein called Glomalin, which seems to be involved in a very important hypha-mediated mechanism of soil aggregate stabilization  Borie et al. 2000; Degens et al. 1996; Rillig et al. 2002 ,  e  Suppression of disease. Mycorrhizae directly and or indirectly antagonize disease organisms, increase the number of biocontrol agents around the roots, occupy potential infection sites on the root, and increase host plant vigor to the extent that it can survive disease  Datnoff et al. 1995; St Arnaud et al. 1997; Thomas et al. 1994 . They act as biocontrol agent,  f  Enhancement of nutrient transfer between plants. This is especially important when nitrogen ﬁxing and non-nitrogen ﬁxing species are planted together. Mycorrhizal roots exploit the soil proﬁle beyond the depletion zone surrounding the absorbing root and its root hairs. Mycorrhizal modiﬁcations of the nutrient uptake properties are dependent on the development of extramatrical hyphae in soil, hyphal absorption of phosphate and other micronutrients, translocation through hyphae over considerable distances and subsequent transfer from fungus to root cells,  g  Enhancement of beneﬁcial interactions with other microbes. Mycorrhizal fungi increase the nitrogen made available to the plant by both symbiotic and free-living bacteria. They also increase phosphate uptake to the plant by PSB and support biocontrol agents that are antagonistic to pathogenic organisms,  h  Salt stress. The enhancement of mineral acquisition especially that of P, K, Zn, Cu, and Fe due to AMF inoculation is more pronounced under salt-stressed conditions. Studies indicate that AMF-inoculated plants have a greater tolerance to salt stress than un-inoculated plants  Al-Karaki and Hammad 2001; Cantrell and Linderman 2001 .  their  4 AM BIOFERTILIZERS HAVE AN EDGE  OVER OTHER BIOFERTILIZERS  This group of biofertilizers is the only among others having fungal system involved. Other biofertilizers exploit bacteria  most commonly. Also this offers wide applicability with a wide range of plants having little selectivity, which is commonly reported in other biofertilizers. Though some exceptions exist with certain nonmycorrhizal families like chenopodiaceae, brassicaceae, and few nonhost plants of nyctaginaceae etc. The storage conditions also are very simple with no extra infrastructural requirements like low temperature and moisture content. Shelf-life is comparatively long. Bacterial systems have short life and cause cell death easily.  The hyphae of fungal system can extend much beyond  a few meters away  the depletion zone and thus can acquire nutrients from a much wider area. The fungal system also produces vegetative structures like chlamydospores and zygospores, which become dormant during periods of environmental stress and germinate with the return of favorable conditions. Thus, they are better equipped for combating unfavorable conditions and have longer shelf- lives compared to bacterial systems. These biofertilizer organisms are broad-spectrum and nonspeciﬁc. A single species is known to colonize approximately 90% of land plants. These biofertilizers have broad ecological adapta- bility and are known to occur in deserts as well as arctic, tropical, and other habitats. They offer a temperate, 25 – 50% reduction in phosphorus fertilizer application depending on the plant.  4.1  Interaction of Natural Biofertilizers  Different biofertilizers have shown nitrogen-ﬁxing, phos- phorus-solubilizing, and phytohormone-producing abilities and are used as for increasing agricultural productivity, for e.g.,  Brady rhizobium for legumes  grain, fodder , plant growth promoting bacteria  PGPR  for cereals  wheat, rice, grasses, etc. , Azolla for the rice ecosystem, and actino- mycetes  Frankia spp.  for forest trees. The AM biofertilizer is known to increase the nitrogen-ﬁxing potential of the legumes when given together with Rhizobium  Chaturvedi and Kumar 1991  and Bradyrhizobium  Werner et al. 1994; Xie et al. 1995 . The mycorrhiza ﬁrst stimulates the nodule bacteria in a sequential process by increasing the tissue phosphorus content; this results in improved nodulation. There are also reports of positive interaction between Azotobacter Azospirillum, and AM fungi  Alnahidh and Gomah 1991 . The AM colonization favorably affects the population of these free-living N-ﬁxing bacteria and thus stimulates better growth of plants. The AM colonization also has a stimulatory effect with different nonlegume nitrogen- ﬁxing plant species. In Casuarina sp., the double inoculation of AM and Frankia improves plant growth and nodulation  Sempavalan et al. 1995 .  Two groups of bacteria, chemo-organotrophs like some Pseudomonas and Bacillus sp., and chemo-lithotrophs, such as Thiobacillus sp., are able to solublize insoluble phosphates.

The AM favors the early establishment and efﬁcacy of these bacteria. The synergistic effect of these fungi should thus be exploited on a large scale in the form of biofertilizers to increase the nitrogen-ﬁxing potential of legumes and nonlegume plant species as well as with different phosphate solubilizers. Mycorrhizal fungi interact with a wide assortment of organisms in the rhizosphere. The result can be positive, neutral, or negative on the mycorrhizal association or a particular component of the rhizosphere. For example, speciﬁc bacteria stimulate EM formation in conifer nurseries and are called mycorrhization helper bacteria. In certain cases these bacteria eliminate the need for soil fumigation  Garbaye 1994 .  5 ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERN ON CHEMICAL FERTILIZER USAGE  Fertilizer production is also an environmental concern. For every ton of phosphoric acid produced, ﬁve tons of phosphogypsum are generated. Phosphogypsum is a solid material that results from the reaction of phosphate rock with sulfuric acid. Although it is nearly identical to natural gypsum, it may contain small amounts of sand, phosphate, ﬂuorine, radium, and other elements present in phosphate ore. Federal regulations restrict both use and research involving phosphogypsum because of its radium content and require phosphogypsum to be stacked on the ground. A limited amount of phosphogypsum, with a minimal radium content, is used as an agricultural soil amendment. During the past 50 years, more than 700 MT have accumulated in Florida alone. These enormous stacks, some covering an area of more than 300 hectares and up to 60 m high, have settling ponds on top that contain highly acidic water that can overﬂow into waterways. New regulations have been enacted to guard against potential spills  Johnson and Traub 1996 .  Mycorrhiza offers an alternative to many problems in an ecofriendly, sustainable, and economical way besides creating employment and facilitating poverty reduction. In situations where the native mycorrhizal inoculum potential is low or ineffective, providing appropriate fungi for the plant production system is worth considering. With the current state of technology, inoculation is best for transplanted crops and in areas where soil disturbance has reduced the native inoculum potential. The ﬁrst step in any inoculation program will be to obtain an isolate that is both infective, and able to penetrate and spread in the root, and effective, or able to enhance the growth and stress tolerance of the host. Individual isolates of mycorrhizal fungi vary widely in these properties, so screening trials are important isolates that will perform successfully. Screening under actual cropping conditions is best because indigenous mycorrhizal fungi, pathogens, and soil chemical and physical properties will inﬂuence the result.  to select  6 MAJOR CONSTRAINTS AND SOLUTIONS  IN COMMERCIALIZATION OF AM BIOFERTILIZER  Perhaps the most important deterrent to the commercial use of mycorrhizal fungi globally is the lack of large-scale multi- location ﬁeld trials in a variety of agricultural soils and an absence of general lack of awareness among the users. Without such an activity it will be difﬁcult to establish a market for mycorrhizal inoculum. Without a market there is little incentive for a commercial setup to initiate the production of inoculum on a commercial scale, and only large-scale production will make large-scale ﬁeld trials possible. Other issues responsible for the general lack of trust amongst the users in its potential are:  a  The lack of cost-beneﬁt analysis to determine the economics of mycorrhizal applications, and  b  The general trend towards excessive fertilization to substitute for the lack of mycorrhizal fungi.  important  Once large-scale applications of  the potential of inocula are proven to common masses on mycorrhizal multi-location ﬁelds, lightweight commercial mycorrhizal formulations will need to be developed and new application methods will be devised. Most importantly, from large-scale ﬁeld tests, cost-beneﬁt analysis will be done accurately to determine the economic beneﬁt derived from the use of mycorrhizal fungi. In the end, this will be the determining factor in the commercial application of mycorrhizal fungi. Biological scientists are rarely able to critically assess the economic factors involved in the application of a new technology. It is important to design the total economic and infrastructure requirement for the setting up a production facility and strict regulatory norms for the quality assessment of the ﬁnished product before the release of the product in the market. The involvement of the scientiﬁc community is important to deﬁne such norms.  The ﬁeld of applied AM research has suffered for many years from the “chicken-and-egg” syndrome. The inoculum was not widely used because it was not readily available, and it was not available because it was not used. The recent boom in commercial AM inoculants will help break out of the cycle. There have been numerous inquiries about the quality of available inoculum. Unfortunately, only little data on which to base recommendations are available. To remedy this situation, the initiation of a quality control assay  QCA  for commercial AM products is essential which will involve conducting a standard mycorrhizal colonization percentage  MCP  assay on commercial AM inoculum received under before making them available in the market. This will need regular supervision and knowledge of the correct mode of production, formulation, and delivery.  Biofertilizers represent an affordable industry for many developing countries. In many African countries, the use of inorganic fertilizer has increased soil acidity, reducing the yield per fertilizer. Biofertilizers are cheap to manufacture, suitable for small-scale farmers if produced locally  eliminating distribution costs , and the investment in  ton of  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   technology is far lower than that of inorganic fertilizers. Biofertilizers have been produced, packaged, and sold commercially in India, while in a number of African and Latin American countries, biofertilizers have been produced at national research centers. Most importantly, the demand for biofertilizers has outstripped production in almost all these countries. It is estimated that about $40,000 – $50,000 is required to build a 100 – 150 MT biofertilizer plant. Alternatively, $500,000 for 10 plants in different locations could produce up to 1000 – 1500 MT to meet the demand by rural farmers. With increased production capacity, bioferti- lizers have a market locally and possibly internationally. Biofertilizers present developing countries with a unique opportunity to enhance their crop yields. Countries like Bangladesh, Brazil, Kenya, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, and Zambia have had successful pilot plants for the production of biofertilizers, and demand has often exceeded production. If any of these countries built a production plant with local and regional markets in mind, they could be exporting their products. India has developed many biofertilizers that are currently on the market for gardeners and farmers. If these products are coupled with crop rotation and irrigation, it is possible to increase crop yields of legumes and cereals. Biopesticides, too, could help increase crop yield, reduce import bills, and increase export earnings. Taken together, they could provide an affordable source of agricultural inputs that would challenge chemical use in rural areas. Chemical fertilizer and pesticide imports and exports from developing countries are low, and production yields are very poor, especially in Africa. Biotechnology will depend on renewable raw materials, and agriculture should play a big role in developing countries’ exports.  6.1 Mycorrhizal Commercialization Techniques  and Their Formulations  The use of AM fungi in plant biotechnology differs from that of other beneﬁcial soil micro-organisms because the fungi involved are obligate symbionts and therefore recalcitrant to pure culture. Thus speciﬁc procedures are required to culture and handle them; speciﬁc tools have to be developed and provided to biotechnological producers.   a   Inoculum technology. Plant inoculation with AM fungi results in the formation of a mycorrhizosphere with selective consequences on other important soil micro-organisms. Therefore the use of AM fungi in plant production needs an appropriate inoculum technology compatible with that used for other beneﬁcial soil micro-organisms. Development of second generation inocula, derived from mixing AM fungi with other inocula, is one such major activity. The use of such inocula will improve plant ﬁtness, and soil aggregation and stability, so increasing yield by biological means. Some of the important issues related to AM biofertilizer commercialization   b   and its long-term viability in the commercial sector are listed here. Inoculum registration. Concerns on ecological, biosafety, and bio-ethics demand the requirement for microbial inoculants to be approved and registered. There is need for a centralized govern- ment-regulated agency to provide the guidelines for AM fungi-speciﬁc standards of inoculum use.   c  Quality control. Speciﬁc protocols for quality control of AM fungal inoculum need to be developed and standardized for application. This is essential not only as a guarantee for producers and users but also for the protection of ecosystems. This would help in quality management and assessment of inoculum potential with every batch of inocula produced. Quality control of commercial AM inoculum is extremely important for developing faith in the user community for its effectively potential. Unless this is achieved, the potential will remain unexplored among the other biofertilizers.   d  Technology transfer. The product concept for AM fungal inoculum is particularly suitable for indus- tries. Scaling up of production and use of AM fungal inoculum is only economically feasible for them if structures to run concerted ﬁeld experiments is available. This needs to be offered by researchers working in the area through case studies in the areas of horticulture, fruit production, and revegetation of desertiﬁed ecosystems. In India, The Energy and Resources Institute, New Delhi has developed AM mass production technology, which was transferred to two leading industries, however, this is a small move for an agricultural country where economy is important and based on the yield production.  6.2 List of Producers and Formulators of  Commercial AM Inoculum  These bio-inoculants are now formulated in different formulations. These are designed on the basis of their application to different crops and locations. They are available in the form of powders, tablets pellets, gel beads, and balls. Intraradical forms of Glomus sp.  vesicles and mycelium fragments  were entrapped in alginate and used as inocula. Isolated intraradical material was found to regenerate in alginate beads and the regenerated mycelium infected roots under controlled conditions  Declerck et al. 1996a,b; Strullu and Plenchette 1991 . Glass beads have also been suggested an inoculum type with spores and mycelia inside  Redecker et al. 1995 . The application in nursery plantations is normally done using pellets or tablets placed just below the seeds or small plantlets initiating mycorrhization in the hardening phase. Alternative approaches for inoculum disbursement include broadcasting in the ﬁeld or mycorrhizal products often contain other ingredients designed to increase  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

For example, organic matter is often added to encourage microbial activity, soil structure, and root growth. Stress vitamins improve nutrient uptake and build root biomass. Water absorbing gels help “plaster” beneﬁcial mycorrhizal spores in close proximity to feeder roots and encourage favorable soil moisture conditions for mycorrhizae to form and grow. Organic biostimulants, in general, are effective ingredients in mycorrhizal products. By promoting ﬁeld competitiveness, stress resistance, and nutrient efﬁciency, biostimulants reduce barriers to rapid mycorrhizal formation especially during the critical period following root initiation or transplanting. A list of commercially available mycorrhizal inocula is provided in the table above.  Recent advances  in the in vitro mode of mass multiplication like optimizing various growth parameters  like pH, media manipulations  Douds 2002  can further increase the recovery of propagules.

This aspect of an alternative to conventional route to more food grain production in a sustainable manner especially gains signiﬁcance for a developing countries where judicious and large scale utilization of this technology can prove very useful for getting maximum and long-term gains in various wasteland reclamation, reforestation, and afforestation programs apart from giving a much desirable thrust in the production of important agricultural crops. The AM biofertilizer technology can be called poor man’s technology. Taking into account the amount of nutrient supplied, biofertilizers are many times cheaper than chemical fertilizers. Biofertilizers improve the quality of produce. They are cheap and economical, the cost beneﬁt ratio is more than 1: 10. It is an ecofriendly practice, improves natural characters of the soil. Uses of biofertilizers maximize ecological beneﬁts and minimize environmental hazards. The demand of biofertilizers is increasing at a tremendous pace, which necessitates the inculcation of the more units to be established in the ﬁeld to rope of the outgrowing demand potential and the challenges of fabulous future scope. Despite many lacunas in its commercialization and delivery to farmers for exploitation of its potential in agriculture, there is little doubt that AM fungi will emerge as a potential tool for improving crop plants as a promising biofertilizer. Future upgradations in the mode of the AM biofertilizer technology development, redeﬁning the rate- limiting factors and exploration of possible AM combinations along with other potential biofertilizers together as a single package for end users might bring a major boon to agriculture sector using nature’s biofertilizers.

Lopez-Llorca Universidad de Alicante, Alicante, Spain  1  INTRODUCTION  2.1 Plant-Parasitic Nematodes  Many nematodes are parasites of plants and animals causing severe damage to crops and livestock. Many antihelminthics used to control animal-parasitic nematodes have created resistance in the nematode population, resulting in decreased control efﬁciency  Nansen 1993 . Nematicides, the chemicals which are used to control plant-parasitic nematodes, are often toxic compounds causing both environmental and health problems. Several of these nematicides have been banned in many countries and the current process of phasing out the ozone-depleting substance, methyl bromide, which is an effective nematicide and insecticide, will increase the nematode problem in agriculture  Nordmeyer 1992 . There- fore, for nonhazardous biological control of parasitic nematodes should be encouraged.  the possibility to use nematophagous fungi  To be able to use nematophagous fungi for biocontrol on a larger scale we need to increase our research efforts to learn more about the life of these organisms, and their interactions with nematodes, plants, and other soil organisms, on ecological as well as cellular and molecular levels. In the present paper we will review and discuss some of the research, which has been performed on nematophagous fungi. Based on recent discoveries we will also speculate on new ways to use nematophagous fungi for nematode control.  2 WHAT ARE NEMATODES?  Nearly one hundred species of plant-parasitic nematodes have been described. They affect most crops causing important diseases. As plant pathogens, their effects are time-dependent and usually do not  unlike other pathogens  kill crops, but levels in spite of reduce crop yields to noneconomical “good agricultural” practices irrigation, agrochemicals, etc. .   fertilization,  Plant-parasitic nematodes differ regarding their feeding behavior  Figure 1 . Migratory ectoparasites  Figure 1A  remain in the soil and feed on the external cell layers of the root. These nematodes cause little damage. Sedentary ectoparasites remain feeding for long periods at the same place therefore causing severe root damage. Migratory endoparasites enter the root and periodically feed as they migrate through the root. Their damage to root tissue can be very important and may cause other soil pathogens, such as fungi or bacteria, to act synergistically causing complex diseases  Agrios 1997 . Sedentary endoparasites  Figure 1B  have developed complex feeding strategies. Essentially, their females become saccate once they start feeding and deeply modify the root tissue in their vicinity to obtain nutrients. The sedentary endoparasites consist of important plant-parasitic nematode groups: the root-knot nematodes  Meloidogyne spp.  and the cyst nematodes  Heterodera and Globodera spp. .  the most  roundworms occurring in most Nematodes are small environments  soil, aquatic, and marine . Most nematodes are saprotrophs or microbivores in the soil. Other nematodes live part or most of their life cycles as parasites of plants or animals. In the current review we will concentrate on parasitic nematodes, mainly those attacking plants.  2.2 Animal-Parasitic Nematodes  There is a large group of nematodes parasitizing both invertebrates and vertebrates. A number of insect-parasitic nematodes, e.g., Steinernema spp., are being developed and commercially used for biological control of plant-parasitic  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

Other animal-parasitic nematodes, e.g., Cooperia spp. and Ostertagia spp., cause severe infections and weight loss in animal husbandry  Larsen 2000 . Several tropical diseases of humans are also caused by nematodes, such as elephantiasis and river blindness  Poinar 1983 .  3 WHAT IS A NEMATOPHAGOUS FUNGUS?  Nematodes constitute a food source for the nematophagous  nematode-destroying  fungi. Living stages of nematodes  eggs, juveniles, vermiform adults, and feeding sedentary females  can be attacked, penetrated, and digested by several types of nematophagous fungi  Jansson and Lopez-Llorca 2001 . Dead nematodes  juveniles, vermiform adults, cysts, and root-knot nematode mature females  may also be invaded by nematophagous as well as other  saprotrophic  fungi, but the latter may not be regarded as proper nematode- destroying fungi. For instance, dead vermiform nematodes may be invaded by nematode-trapping fungi, but then the fungi enter the natural openings  mouth, anus, etc.  of the nematodes and never penetrate their cuticles  Nordbring- Hertz and Sta˚lhammar-Carlemalm 1978 , and thus represent the saprophytic growth stage of these fungi. Most  nematophagous fungi are facultative parasites and exist in both saprophytic and parasitic  with infection structures, proper lytic enzyme systems, etc.  stages induced by external and or internal signals.  The nematophagous fungi are divided into groups depending on their mode of infecting nematodes: nematode- trapping  Figure 2A , endoparasitic  Figure 2B , egg- and female-parasitic  Figure 2C , and toxin-producing fungi  Jansson et al. 1997 . Irrespective of the mode of infection, the ﬁnal result is always the same—a complete digestion of the host. Nematode-trapping fungi capture vermiform nematodes in special trapping organs formed on the hyphae  Barron 1977 . The traps can have either an adhesive function where the nematodes stick to the trap, or a mechanical function. These fungi, e.g., Arthrobotrys oligospora, are characterized by low host speciﬁcity and lower parasitic ability. The endoparasites, e.g., Drechmeria coniospora, use their spores to infect the nematode hosts. The spores of these fungi can either be motile, e.g., zoospores, or nonmotile, e.g., conidia of various fungi. The endoparasites have high host speciﬁcity and are mostly obligate parasites. The toxin- producing fungi, e.g., Pleurotus ostreatus, immobilize their victims using toxins prior to penetration. These three groups of fungi all attack vermiform nematode stages.

Verticillium chlamydosporium .  4 HABITAT OF NEMATOPHAGOUS FUNGI  4.1 Soil  The nematophagous fungi are soil inhabitants found in most soil types from tropical to arctic areas of the planet, although they are most frequent in organic soils. One to ﬁve species of nematophagous fungi are usually recovered from a soil sample. Their abundance varies from 1.8 – 150 propagules per gram of soil  Persmark et al. 1996 . These variations are due to “environmental factors,” e.g., soil type, organic matter, water content, temperature, and presence of nematode hosts. Since most nematophagous fungi are facultative parasites they also have the capacity to live saprophytically on dead organic matter in soil. Therefore, the soil should obviously be seen as the ultimate sink of nematophagous fungi. The nematophagous fungi, in spite of their saprophytic ability, are not especially good competitors in soil. Therefore, the capacity to invade other organisms—nematodes, other fungi, plant roots—is important for their survival in the soil. The interactions with these potential hosts will be discussed in the following sections.  4.2 Nematodes  By infecting nematodes the nematophagous fungi have the ability to thrive in a sheltered environment protected from other soil microorganisms. There are reports that nematophagous fungi form antibiotic compounds upon infection of nematodes  Barron 1977 . The vermiform nematodes are actively moving in soil and are chemically  attracted to the nematode-trapping and endoparasitic fungi  Jansson and Nordbring-Hertz 1988 . After contact with the infective structure  trapping organ or spore  the nematode becomes attached, which eventually leads to penetration of the host  Tunlid et al. 1992 . Since the nematodes move vigorously and also have high internal hydrostatic pressure the production of an efﬁcient adhesive is vital for successful infection, both as a holdfast and for sealing the penetration area. The nonmotile nematode eggs may be infected by egg-parasitic fungi, the hyphae of which actively grow towards the egg. Upon contact the fungus forms an appressorium that adhere to the eggshell. This stage is followed by penetration of the egg shell and digestion of the contents of the egg  premature or mature juveniles . Infected and dead nematodes may constitute a means for the nematophagous fungi to survive in soil during harsh environmental conditions.  4.3 Fungi  Several species of nematode-trapping fungi, including A. oligospora, can attack other fungi, e.g., Rhizoctonia solani  Persson et al. 1985 . This mycoparasitic behavior takes place by coiling of the hyphae of the nematode-trapping fungi around the host hyphae, which results in disintegration of the host cell cytoplasm without penetration of the host. Although this phenomenon has never been observed in soil it may increase the ﬁtness of the nematode-trapping fungi in soil by reducing competition and providing nutrients. Moreover it may extend the biocontrol capability of nematophagous fungi as biocontrol agents  BCAs  to fungal parasites as well as nematodes. Furthermore, P. chlamydosporia has been described infecting propagules of important plant pathogens, such as uredospores of rust fungi  Leinhos and Buchenauer 1992 , and oospores of Phytophthora and other oomycetes  Sneh et al. 1977 .  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   4.4 Roots  5 MODE OF ACTION OF  NEMATOPHAGOUS FUNGI  The rhizosphere is a habitat with high microbial activity due to release of nutrients from root exudates and decaying cells. Like other micro-organisms, nematophagous fungi are more frequent in the root zone, with up to 19 times more propagules than in the surrounding nonrhizosphere soil  Persmark and Jansson 1997 . Numbers of nematodes are also higher in the rhizosphere than in bulk soil. Since plant-parasitic nematodes attack their plant hosts in the root, understanding of the rhizosphere biology of nematophagous fungi is important in order to use nematophagous fungi for biological control of such nematodes. Nematodes are generally attracted to their host roots by speciﬁc or unspeciﬁc compounds, e.g., CO2  Green 1971 . Besides, some nematophagous fungi, e.g., A. oligospora, grow chemotropically towards plant roots  Bordallo et and nematode-trapping fungi have been found to invade and grow endophytically in epidermal and cortical cells of plant  Bordallo et al. 2002; Lopez- Llorca 2002b . Root colonization by nematophagous fungi will be further discussed in “Fungi—Root – Interactions.”  al. 2002 . Recently,  roots  Figure 1C   egg-parasitic  The interactions between nematophagous fungi and their hosts involve several steps from recognition  attraction phenomena, contact , production of adhesives and lytic enzymes, differentiation of infection structures, e.g., appres- soria and trapping organs, to host penetration and digestion of the host cell contents  Tunlid et al. 1992 . These events have been studied using a variety of techniques  microscopic, biochemical, and molecular . In the following section we will discuss some of these interactions in connection with two of the hosts of nematophagous fungi: the nematode and the plant.  5.1 Fungus – Nematode Interactions  5.1.1 Nematode-Trapping Fungi  Arthrobotrys oligospora forms so-called adhesive network traps on which vermiform nematodes are captured. The formation of traps in this fungus is induced chemically by  Figure 3 Top ﬁgures show infection of nematode egg by the egg parasite Pochonia sp. Germling of the fungus forms an appressorium after contact with the egg surface  left . An adhesive is formed and the fungus penetrates the egg shell, grows inside the egg, and digests its contents.

The middle ﬁgure  enlargement of left ﬁgure  shows the trap, covered with adhesive, penetration of the nematode cuticle, and formation of an infection bulb.

Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   small peptides, e.g., phenylalanyl valine  Nordbring-Hertz 1973  or by nematodes  Nordbring-Hertz 1977 . The presence of traps is a prerequisite for infection of living nematodes, and in fact increases the ability of the fungus to chemically attract nematodes  Jansson 1982 . After contact between the fungal trap and the nematode cuticle  Figure 3 bottom left  a possible contact recognition step occurs involving a fungal lectin binding to N-acetylgalactose amine  Gal-NAc  on the nematode surface  Nordbring-Hertz and Mattiasson 1979 . The nematode surface, the cuticle  Figure 3 bottom right , consists of several layers containing proteins  mainly collagen , lipids, and carbohydrates  Bird and Bird 1991 . Externally to the cuticle a surface coat  or glycocalyx  consisting of glycoproteins is found  Bird and Bird 1991 . The surface coat is probably the part of the nematode surface most relevant to recognition and adhesion of nematophagous fungi, since proteolytic removal of this structure results in reduced adhesion of bacteria and spores of endoparasitic nematophagous fungi  Bird 1985; Jansson 1993 .  The trapping organ of A. oligospora contains an adhesive material. Upon contact with the nematode surface, a recognition step possibly mediated, at least partly, by lectin  binding, induces changes in the structure of the adhesive leading to capture of the nematode  Veenhuis et al. 1985 . The adhesive undergoes changes from an amorphous material to a ﬁbrillar structure, more organized with ﬁbrils perpendicular to the nematode surface. This may anchor the nematode to the trap thus facilitating infection. In contrast, the adhesive of the endoparasitic fungus D. coniospora does not appear to change and has a ﬁbrillar structure even in the absence of nematodes  Jansson and Nordbring-Hertz 1988 . After the ﬁrm attachment to the host surface, A. oligospora penetrates the nematode cuticle and forms an infection bulb  Figure 3 bottom middle , from which trophic hyphae grow out to digest the nematode contents  Veenhuis et al. 1985 . In the trap and the infection bulb organelles, so-called dense bodies, now appear. These organelles are not present in ordinary hyphae and have been suggested to contain hydrolytic enzymes used for penetration of the cuticle and digestion of host  Jansson and Nordbring-Hertz 1988; Veenhuis et al. 1985 .  As in many other instances of fungal penetration of their hosts’ surfaces, nematophagous fungi appear to use both enzymatic and physical means. The nematode cuticle mainly  Figure 4 Hypothesis of interference with nematode chemotaxis.

A serine protease, PII, from A. oligospora, has been characterized, cloned, and sequenced  A˚ hman et al. 1996 . The expression of PII is increased by the presence of proteins, including nematode cuticles  A˚ hman et al. 1996 . PII belongs to the subtilisin family and has a molecular mass of 32 kDa  for review see Jansson et al. 1997 . Serine proteases will also be discussed in “Egg Parasites.” During decompo- sition of infected nematodes A. oligospora produces a lectin  A. oligospora lectin, AOL , which functions as a storage protein within the nematode host, and may constitute as much as 50% of the total fungal protein. AOL is a multispeciﬁc lectin, which binds to sugar chains common in animal glycoproteins, including those of nematodes  Rose´n et al. 1997 .  5.1.2 Egg Parasites  Egg-destroying fungi act on nematode eggs at two levels: directly as true parasites by penetrating and infecting eggs, and indirectly by causing distortions in the larvae or embryos they contain  Morgan-Jones and Rodrigues-Ka´bana 1988 . The former mode of action is well documented and is largely responsible for cases of soil supressiveness to nematodes. In this chapter we will describe the direct mode of fungal infection of nematode eggs mainly using the egg-parasitic fungi Pochonia rubescens  syn. Verticillium suchlasporium  and P. chlamydosporia  syn. V. chlamydosporium .  Upon growth of germ tubes the hyphal tips swell and differentiate into appressoria at contact with nematode eggs  Lopez-Llorca and Claugher 1990   Figures 2 and 4 , as well as on artiﬁcial, especially hydrophobic surfaces  Lopez- Llorca et al. 2002b . An extracellular material  ECM  probably functions as adhesive, but possibly also seals the hole caused by the penetration hypha  Figure 3, top . This ECM can be labeled with the lectin Concanavalin A, indicating that the ECM contains mannose glucose moieties probably on side chains of glycoproteins  Lopez-Llorca et al. 2002b . Most ECMs of fungal hyphae consist of proteins and carbohydrates  Nicholson 1996 .  of  Early  eggshell  evidence  penetration  by P. chlamydosporia came from studies of plant- and animal- parasitic nematode egg infection  Lysek and Krajci 1987; Morgan-Jones et al. 1983 . In eggshells, low electron dense areas were found in the vicinity of penetration hyphae of P. rubescens on cyst nematodes  Lopez-Llorca and Robertson 1992a  suggesting involvement of eggshell degradation enzymes. Nematode eggshells mostly contain protein and chitin  Clarke et al. 1967  organized in a microﬁbrillar and amorphous structure  Wharton 1980 . Therefore, a search for extracellular enzymes degrading those polymers was carried out. A 32-kDa serine protease  P32  was ﬁrst puriﬁed and characterized from the egg parasite P. rubescens  Lopez- Llorca 1990 . Involvement of the enzyme in pathogenesis was suggested by quick in vitro degradation of Globodera pallida egg shell proteins  Lopez-Llorca 1990 , but most of all by its  immunolocalization in appressoria of the fungus infecting Heterodera schachtii eggs  Lopez-Llorca and Robertson 1992b . Although pathogenesis is a complex process involving many factors, inhibition of P32 with chemicals and polyclonal antibodies reduced egg infection and penetration  Lopez-Llorca et al. 2002b . The similar species P. chlamydosporia also produces extracellular proteases  VcP1   Segers et al. 1994 , which are immunologically related to P32 and similar enzymes from entomopathogenic fungi  Segers et al. 1995 . VcP1-treated eggs were more infected than untreated eggs suggesting a role of the enzyme in eggshell penetration by egg-parasitic fungi. Recently, several chitinolytic enzymes of Pochonia spp. were detected. One of those accounting for most of the activity was a 43-kDa endochitinase  CHI43   Tikhonov et al. 2002 . When G. pallida eggs were treated with both P32 and CHI43, damage to eggshell was more extensive than with each enzyme alone, suggesting a co-operative effect of both enzymes to degrade egg shells  Tikhonov et al. 2002 .  5.1.3  Interference with Nematode Chemoreception  Carbohydrates present on nematodes are not only involved in the recognition step of lectin binding, but also appear to be involved in nematode chemotaxis  Jansson 1987; Zuckerman and Jansson 1984 . The main nematode sensory organs are the amphids and the inner labial papillae located around the mouth in the head region of the nematodes  Ward et al. 1975 . Figure 4  right  schematically depicts the structure of amphids in the nematode head. The chemoreceptors are thought to be located on the neuron membrane. There are 28 neurons in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, each with a passage to the environment, but the number of receptors is not known  Ward 1978 .  A hypothesis of the involvement of carbohydrates in nematode chemoreception was put forward by Zuckerman  1983 ; Zuckerman and Jansson  1984 . The chemoreceptors, purportedly glycoproteins, could be blocked  Figure 4B  by lectins  Concanavalin A binding to mannose glucose residues, and Limulin binding to sialic acid  resulting in loss of chemotactic behavior of bacterial-feeding nematodes to bacterial exudates  Jeyaprakash et al. 1985 . Furthermore, treatment of the nematodes with enzymes  mannosidase and sialidase  thus obliterating the terminal carbohydrates  Figure 4C  also resulted in decreased chemotactic behavior  Jansson et al. 1984 , demonstrating the importance of these carbohydrate moieties in nematode chemotaxis.  Interfering with nematode chemotaxis, thereby inhibiting their host-ﬁnding behavior, may be a possible way of controlling plant-parasitic nematodes. In a pot experiment using tomato as host plant and Meloidogyne incognita as parasitic nematode, addition of Concanavalin A and Limax ﬂavus agglutinin  sialic acid speciﬁc lectin  resulted in decreased plant damage by the nematode compared to controls  Marban-Mendoza et al. 1987 . Addition of lectins  or enzymes  on a ﬁeld is not feasible, but the possibility to use, for instance, lectin-producing leguminous plants have  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   been shown to reduce galling by root-knot nematodes  Marban-Mendoza et al. 1992 .  The endoparasitic nematophagous fungus D. coniospora infects nematodes with its conidia, which adhere to the chemosensory organs  Figures 2 and 4   Jansson and Nordbring-Hertz 1983 . Conidial adhesion was suggested to involve a sialic acid-like carbohydrate since treatment of nematodes with the lectin Limulin, and treatment of the spores with sialic acid, decreased adhesion  Jansson and Nordbring-Hertz 1984 . Furthermore, nematodes with newly adhered spores lost their ability to respond chemotactically to all attraction sources tested, i.e., conidia, hyphae, and bacteria, indicating a connection between adhesion and chemotaxis through carbohydrates on the nematode surface  Jansson and Nordbring-Hertz 1983 . The conidia of D. coniospora adhere to the chemosensory organs of Meloidogyne spp., but do not penetrate and infect the nematodes. Irrespective of the lack of infection the fungus was capable of reducing root galling in tomato in a biocontrol experiment  Jansson et al. 1985 , again indicating the involvement of chemotactic interference.  5.2 Fungi – Root – Nematode Interactions  roots, is important  Nematophagous fungi can infect, kill, and digest living nematodes. Most of these fungi can also live saprophytically and some even have mycoparasitic abilities. Since most plant- the rhizosphere parasitic nematodes attack plant biology of nematophagous fungi from a biological control point of view. We previously described that nematophagous fungi were more abundant in the rhizosphere than in bulk soil  Persmark and Jansson 1997 . In recent investigations we studied the colonization of internal cells of plant roots  Bordallo et al. 2002; Lopez-Llorca et al. 2002a . In these experiments we used axenic barley and tomato plants grown in vermiculite and inoculated with the nematode-trapping fungus A. oligospora or the egg-parasite P. chlamydosporia. Roots were sequentially sampled, cryo- sectioned, and observed under light- or cryo-scanning electron microscopes. Both fungi grew inter- and intra- cellularly, formed appressoria when penetrating plant cell walls of epidermis and cortex cells, but never entered vascular tissues  Figure 2C . In contrast to Pochonia spp., appressoria had never been observed previously in A. oligospora. Using histochemical stains we could show plant defense reactions, e.g., papillae, lignitubers, and other cell wall appositions induced by nematophagous fungi, but these never prevented root colonization. Callose depositions in papillae are shown in Figure 5. Nematophagous fungi grew extensively especially in monocotyledon plants producing abundant mycelia, conidia, and chlamydospores  P. chlamydosporia . Necrotic areas of initial stages of colonization by A. oligospora, but were never seen at later stages even when the fungi proliferated in epidermal and cortical cells. P. chlamydosporia colonized roots displayed higher proteolytic activity than uninoculated control roots  the roots were observed at  Figure 5 Arthrobotrys oligospora colonizing barley root. Callose deposition in cell wall papillae  arrow  stained with  Siroﬂuor. Bar ¼ 20 mm:  From Bordallo et al. 2002, courtesy of  Blackwell Science .   Montfort et al. unpublished . The signiﬁcance of this fact for biological control is under investigation in our laboratory.  The growth of the two nematophagous fungi in plant roots appears to be like that of an endophyte. Whether this endophytic growth induces systemic resistance to nematodes and or plant pathogens in plants is yet unknown, but worth further investigations. Endophytic rhizobacteria reducing plant-parasitic nematodes have been described  Hallmann et al. 2001 , as well as the reduction of root-knot nematodes by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi  Waecke et al. 2001 . If this is the case also in nematophagous fungi this will open up a new area of biocontrol using these fungi. The internal root colonization by egg-parasitic fungi, e.g., Pochonia spp., may give the fungi an opportunity to infect nematode eggs in egg sacks of root-knot nematodes inside the roots and reduce subsequent spread and infection of roots by the second generation of juveniles. Structures resembling trapping organs were observed in epidermal cells colonized by A. oligospora, and these may serve the purpose of trapping newly hatched juveniles escaping the roots. The ability to colonize plant roots may also be a survival strategy of these fungi and could explain soil suppressiveness to plant-parasitic nematodes in nature. The colonization of plant roots is a new area of research that deserves in-depth investigations, not the least for biocontrol purposes. This is presently underway in our laboratory.  6 BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF PLANT-  PARASITIC NEMATODES  The use of nematophagous fungi for biological control of plant-parasitic nematodes has a long history  for extensive review on earlier experiments see Stirling 1991 . The investigations have resulted in variable and confusing results—sometimes excellent control results, at other  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   occasions no control at all. The reasons for these varying results may be many, but the major reason is probably lack of knowledge, both on physiology and ecology of the nematophagous fungi. Their interaction in soil with nematodes, plants, other organisms, and the soil environment is little understood because of difﬁculties of working in the complex soil matrix and also lack of good methods for these purposes. We believe it is necessary to perform both laboratory experiments and ﬁeld studies using old and new techniques to understand the complexity of nematophagous fungi interactions with their environment. In the following section we will discuss some of the possibilities to use nematophagous fungi for biological control.  6.1 Sources of Antagonists to Nematodes  Just as the biodiversity of the planet is becoming more and more reduced, scientists and the general public are becoming more aware of its importance in “practical” terms. Microbial biodiversity is little known but even the most “humble” soil may contain strains of microorganisms with interesting antagonistic properties. In the past, the use of antagonists for biocontrol purposes was restricted to the culturability of the putative organisms detected. Nowadays, in the post-genomic era, our capabilitites of handling genetic material of organisms allow the detection of microorganisms or their metabolites in the environment. The classical approach for ﬁnding antagonists has been to search for them in places where their target did not cause damage or disease in spite of host presence. Clear examples of these places are suppressive soils.  The most studied sources for  fungal antagonists of nematodes are soils naturally suppressive to plant-parasitic nematodes. The ﬁrst example to be discovered was the decline of Heterodera avenae populations in cereal monocultures. Using previous data from nematode population dynamics and with a stepwise approach, Kerry  1987  and co-workers found fungal parasites of females  Nematophthora gynophila  and eggs  P. chlamydosporia  to be the biotic causes for nematode suppression. Similar situations have been found elsewhere in the world with soils suppressive to cyst nematodes. Root-knot nematodes have a much wider host range than cyst nematodes. Besides, many crop hosts of root knot nematodes are grown under intensive agricultural conditions with regular use of agrochemicals. Under these conditions soil antagonists are not favoured. Therefore, fewer examples of natural suppressive soils to root-knot nematodes have been found. Among these are tree orchards in the United States, where the egg-parasitic nematophagous fungus Dactylella oviparasitica was ﬁrst isolated  Stirling and Mankau 1978 . In a similar environment, ring nematodes  Criconemella spp.  were found to be suppressed by Hirsutella rhossiliensis, an endoparasitic nematophagous fungus  Jaffee and Zehr 1982 . Both antagonists are examples of organisms with an important ecological role but difﬁcult to use biotechnologically. Both fungi have a limited growth rate and sporulation. Soil  suppresiveness to nematodes is a very complex phenomenon. In a study to ﬁnd causes for nematode decline, Persmark et al.  1995  did not ﬁnd differences in nematophagous fungi populations between putative suppressive and conducive soils in Central America.  Searching for nematophagous fungi in agroecosystem soils have yielded fungal antagonists with potential as BCAs of plant-parasitic nematodes. For instance, cyst nematodes were infected by the entomopathogenic species Lecanicillium lecanii  syn. Verticillium lecanii  in the United States  Meyer et al. 1990 . In other instances, fungal antagonists have remained undescribed and their use halted for lack of sporulation, e.g., ARF-18, a sterile fungus infecting cyst nematodes in the United States  Kim and Riggs 1991 . The search for nematophagous fungi in natural “undisturbed” ecosystems is another approach for ﬁnding antagonistic potential, e.g., the Antarctic  Gray 1982  or the tropical rain forest. Costa Rica still offers protected areas where such studies can be carried out. Our laboratory is presently involved in such a survey.  Another approach of using fungi for nematode control is to identify nematophagous metabolites. These substances can be identiﬁed from nonpreviously described nematophagous fungi, e.g., cuticular disruption of Caenorhabditis elegans by Byssochlamys nivea  Park et al. 2001 . A search for nematicial molecules from Arthrobotrys and other fungi was carried out by Anke et al.  1995 . In the future, genes  e.g., toxins, enzymes  can be a source of antagonistic potential against nematodes, which can be used for improvement of BCAs.  6.2 Fungal Biocontrol Delivery Systems for  Nematodes  After isolation, antagonists of nematodes have to be developed for biocontrol. The ﬁrst step usually involves a screening program including traits relevant to the perform- ance of these organisms in the ﬁeld. Root colonization is considered as an important ability for biocontrol of plant- parasitic nematodes  Bourne et al. 1996 . Evaluation of pathogenicity, especially to nematode eggs, is difﬁcult since these stages are nonmotile. Several techniques have been used for this purpose  Gunasekera et al. 2000; Irving and Kerry 1986; Lopez-Llorca et al. 2002b . Once fungal antagonists have been rated, promising strains should be stored in a safe way. To this respect, an assessment of the existing methods of fungal preservation on nematophagous fungi should be carried out. Stirling  formulations of nematophagous fungi for use in laboratory  Stirling et al. 1998a,b  and ﬁeld experiments  Stirling and Smith 1998 . Control of root-knot nematodes was achieved in microcosms, but not in the ﬁeld. The authors stressed that formulations with greater activity should be developed for ﬁeld experiments. Other factors than formulation design could also be responsible  colleagues  developed  and  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   for poor performance of BCAs in the ﬁeld. Soil microfauna, e.g., enchytraeids  Jaffee 1999  and nematodes, have been found to consume the nematophagous fungi inoculum. Soil receptivity to inoculum of nematophagous fungi should be assessed before delivery of large amounts of inoculations are to be carried out  Wakelin et al. 1999 .  The effects of nontarget organisms beneﬁcial to the crop rhizosphere, e.g., mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobacteria, on nematophagous fungi have not yet been characterized. Such studies would improve the design of synergistic methods of approaching biocontrol of root diseases caused by nematodes and other pathogens.  7 CONCLUSIONS  To use nematophagous fungi for biological control of nematophagous fungi we need to know much more about their biology, on physiological as well as ecological levels. This is especially true for the tri-trophic interactions between the fungi, nematodes, and plant roots. While the invasion of roots by plant-parasitic nematodes is fairly well established, little is known about root colonization by nematophagous fungi. The endophytic growth of these fungi needs to be further investigated using cellular, molecular, as well as ecological studies, to ﬁnd out if the nematophagous fungi can induce, instance, systemic resistance in plants to nematodes and other plant pathogens. If this is true and can be developed further, it will add a new property of nematophagous fungi apart from their nematode-destroying ability, and selection of nematophagous fungi for their root colonizing capacity may have equal importance to their nematophagous ability.  for  Combinations of different types of nematophagous fungi, e.g., egg-parasitic and nematode-trapping fungi, which infect various stages of the nematode life cycles, have been rarely studied in biocontrol experiments. Good egg parasites will be able to destroy nematode eggs, even in root-knot nematode galls inside roots, and nematode trappers may capture juveniles entering or leaving roots. Such experiments need to be conducted in both laboratory and ﬁeld investigations for development of BCAs as a practical way to control plant-parasitic nematodes.  In the soil and root environment, nematophagous fungi are difﬁcult to study mainly due to lack of appropriate methods. New techniques therefore have been developed and used, especially for tracing fungi in the environment. Antibodies from spore or hyphal surfaces have been tried, but these usually show cross reactions between species and are difﬁcult to use. Molecular techniques probably need to be employed. These could involve, for instance, transformation with marker genes [e.g., the green ﬂuorescence protein  GFP ], or development of molecular beacons or similar approaches based on speciﬁc DNA sequences.  Development of proper delivery systems  production, formulation, application, etc.  and the effect on nontarget organisms are key factors involved in the good performance  of nematophagous fungi as BCAs. A fair deal of basic research should be invested in these ﬁelds. These efforts will also ﬁnd applications in other ﬁelds of root health.

Khachatourians  College of Agriculture, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada  1  INTRODUCTION  The concepts and practical applications of fungal bio- technology continue to make signiﬁcant contributions to food science. Several recent books and monograms have been dedicated to this topic  Hui and Khachatourians 1995; Khachatourians and Arora 2001; Khachatourians and Arora 2002; Khachatourians et al. 2002; Pointing and Hyde 2001; Rajak 2000; Singh and Aneja 1999 . Table 1 shows a few key food products and processes that depend on applied mycology and biotechnology. Without exception many aspects of food ingredient and process technologies involving fungi are impacted by research in biotechnology, for example, functional foods, nutraceuticals, value added foods, and food pathogen and safety detection systems. Inevitably, and beyond the laboratory level research, the development of food biotechnology depends on research and developments in engineering and down stream processing. It is in this context that the convergence of food science and engineering create crosscutting opportunities for the two disciplines, biotechnol- ogy and engineering. An obvious group of foods in this crosscut is the large-scale production of fermented foods, edible mushrooms, so called, single cell proteins  SCP . and fermented beverages. Finally, fungi in food technology have beneﬁted from intellectual property rights associated with both engineered fungi and process patents. Fungal biotech- nology should enjoy being a primary driver of world food production technologies.  2 CURRENT FOOD SUPPLY AND DEMAND  With the geometric doubling of population and marginally arithmetic doubling of food production, the ideas of Robert  Malthus proposed in 1798 remains as controversial as when they ﬁrst appeared. Malthus’s hypothesis remained an important unanswered question for years after the bicentennial of Malthus’s paper. Brown et al.  1999  point out what additional issues complicate the simplistic Malthusian thought are additional constraints of public health and global economy. One major intervening force has been the emergence of new and reemerging infectious diseases, which in the absence of global war have had an equivalent effect in terms of human suffering and death worldwide. Ironically, these epidemics are occurring again in spite of advanced medical technologies and accelerated methods of health care delivery and immunization. To further complicate the issue, the conventional practice of agriculture has not doubled and cannot double the production of plant and animal-based foods, which are still at the mercy of nature and its disasters. Presumably, biotechnology has emerged as a solution, or an option for one, at least for the moment.  Disciplinary crossover of biochemistry, genetics, micro- biology, nutritional sciences, engineering, and emergence of biotechnology set the stage for reconsidering the paradigm of agriculture from traditional breeding for food plants  Khachatourians 2002 . The strongest impact on agriculture in this area occurred after the discovery of in vitro genetic engineering and the use of transgenic plants. Biotechnology as a new era, 20 years into its development, is showing its positive impacts in production agriculture and new food crops.  It could be said that we still have some distance to travel before a larger contextual effect can be felt. In general there is conﬁdence that judicious and timely applications of modern genetics to plant science will be an important driver of world agriculture. Given the rising number of people it is also understood that abundance of transgenic food plants does not  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   Table 1 Food production through fungal biotechnology  Amino acids Beverages Dairy products Digestive aids Dough Ethnic foods  keﬁr, koji, miso, tempeh,  Food pigments Food enzymes Mushrooms Organic acids Single-cell protein  etc.   Vitamins  necessarily translate into abundant supply for people. To feed the world population, we must strive to overcome global deﬁciencies in food transportation, and storage in many countries as well as its affordability  Khachatourians 2002 . Certainly, agricultural biotechnology can provide part of the answer, but global sociopolitical factors, including ethics of farming, farmers, corporate agribusiness, world trade organizations and states, and international treaties and enforcement agencies, will also be inﬂuential.  3 THE BALANCING ROLE OF FOOD  TECHNOLOGY  Historically applications of agronomic practices have been the most signiﬁcant exploitation for food production. Many countries rely on importation of food grains, fruits, and vegetables. However, many nations have shortfalls of food crops that are exasperated by unpredictable global climate change. The world production of grains per person has remained at about 300 – 340 kg since 1970s. Of the three— wheat, rice, and corn—the world wheat carryover stock was at 78 days in 1999. The food security threshold is 70 days. The supply of rice stocks was down to 42 days of consumption; consumption had been on the rise for 26 consecutive years since 1973  Khachatourians 2002 . A decade has passed since the United Nations’ Framework Convention on Climate Change, and even with three major gatherings, Rio Earth Summit, Kyoto Protocol, and this year’s Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development, we are no where near adoption of a policy that would help sustain world development trends, whether food and agriculture, or food security and safety, or population increase.  If we add the role of water  The summer of 2002 brought drought to parts of the North America and ﬂooding to parts of Europe and Asia which seriously affected world wheat and other grains production, subsequent grain harvesting, and overall food production markets. in irrigation, sustainability of food and agriculture trends for production, and its scarcity, the outlook deteriorates dramatically. A total of 1000 ton of water is required to produce 1 ton of grain. Aquifer depletion or contamination is an ignored but real threat to plant based food production. Various contributions of biotechnology and construction of transgenic plants and applications of microbial biotechnology are one of the known  trends for building production capacity in the next 25 years  Khachatourians 2002; Khachatourians et al. 2002 .  food science,  It is becoming increasingly clear that the once known questions and hence answers of food production are no longer that well known or understood  Khachatourians 2001 . Other unknown elements of further increase in appropriate food production are the understanding of the shift that has occurred in the paradigmatic aspects of from the delicate balance of the interplay in organismic biology, Availability of germplasms, and Applications of biotech- nology to co-operation of environment and issues of food governance, science, safety, and economics  Phillips and Wolfe 2001 . While plant and animal biomass based food production is advancing more rapidly than in past decades, new understandings of the processes involved in production and post production events, especially by biotechnological means can and add value to post production agriculture to foods and new products by microorganisms. Innovation, invention, and investments in biotechnology will continue to impact the food industry and possibly help to maintain equilibrium of food production and consumption  Phillips and Khachatourians 2001 .  4 FUNGAL BIOTECHOLOGY IN FOOD  PRODUCTION  fungal  technology,  No matter how anecdotal the evidence, even the ancient societies recognized the use of in relationship with their agriculture and food. Knowledge of fungal diversity and distinguishing beneﬁcial fungi for the biotransformation of food ingredients, helped to sustain and extend our food source. In spite of the powerful toxic secondary metabolites of many fungi, humanity survived these fungi and through innovative use of the beneﬁcial micro and macro fungi found particular culinary and other uses of the mushrooms  see: this volume, chapter by Rai .  The importance of the fungi relates to their particular modes of growth and proliferation, production, and secretion of extracellular enzymes, peptides of novel functions  taste, functions, and antimicrobial activity  and physiological secondary metabolites and antibiotics consequential to prevention of infectious microbial growth. The molecular biologists of the day work with a few well-studied fungi,  Table 2  but many others from the 72,000 species wait in line to be studied  Hawksworth 1991 .  Through advances in the fungal biotechnology we understand fungal role in the new age of applied molecular biology. As we have a growing base of some 10,000 fungal species in various collections and the public domain literature we have some of the relevant knowledge to cross connect to biotechnology for exploitation of food and ingredients manufactured for human beneﬁt. The knowledge base in mycology is in a good position to lead the new biotechnology of food.  fungi  for  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

It is expected that efforts in the public and private sector research establishments should provide new inputs for food production. On the output side, it is expected that increased productivity, higher value added, improved quality and shelf life, and spoilage protection will impact market situation. These products and processes for food crops and agricultural practice are not only challenging for the scientiﬁc community interested in mycology but also for public health and commerce. From various estimates, the values of sales of mycology-based products can run into tens of billion of dollars, projected by this decade, certainly not an insigniﬁcant ﬁgure.  5 FOOD BIOTECHNOLOGY: PRODUCTS  AND PROCESSES  Whether through traditional or present day biotechnological routes, fundamental applications of fungi have made a substantial impact on our foods  Hui and Khachatourians  1995; Khachatourians and Arora 2001; 2002 . Historically, applications of mycology in agriculture and food have been exploited by many countries and ethnic groups and are now being enhanced by several tools and concepts of biotechnol- ogy  Hui and Khachatourians 1995; Pointing and Hyde 2001; Singh and Aneja 1999 . In recent years much are emerging in the developed countries that serves as new learning opportunities in application of fungal biotechnology for the food and environment. As it can be seen from chapters of this book, there are more rapid advances and new understandings of the processes and new products aided or deterred by fungal biotechnology. food technology, whether pre- or postharvest food crop manage- ment, transformation and value differentiation of commod- ities, increased production efﬁciency, increased value-in-use of animal and plant food and nonfood markets will be affected by fungal biotechnology.  In general, all areas of  As evident from the ﬁrst section of this compendium, a large proportion of the innovations in food biotechnology come from the renewed assessment of fungal physiology, biochemistry and genetics in order to determine methods and options for manipulations at the molecular level. Outside the natural sciences, agricultural biotechnology of today also requires the convergence of several disciplines from production strategies, process engineering, commerce, and international law. Indeed it is the entire process of science, investment, inventions, and innovations that are the interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary characteristics of the new biotechnology  Phillips and Khachatourians 2001 .  Advances in ingredient subdisciplines of mycology as in the past will remain the drivers of applied agricultural research. With new interests there will be major investment focused on generating discoveries and their applications towards both conventional and biotechnology oriented useful products and processes or services.  In the sections to follow we will present certain highlights of basic and applied mycology that are exciting developments and which impact the cross connection with biotechnology for applications to agri-food  Rajak 2000 . Needless to say speciﬁc developments in ﬁelds ancillary to mycology should continue to be of signiﬁcant impact on the new applied mycology and biotechnology products and processes.  5.1 Food-Use Enzyme Production  Speciﬁc enzymes create particular functional and hence value contributions in foods. The predominant source for global market demand of enzymes comes from fungi and bacteria. From a multitude of enzymes synthesized and many secreted extra-cellular, a few occupy the dominant role in food ingredient production  MacCabe et al. 2002 . Biotechnology continues to enhance the yield and functional attributes of fungal enzymes  see: this volume, chapters by Saxsena and Malhotra, and Viniegra-Gonzalez . The most important aspect of this realization has been in the application in the context of food production processing including  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   immobilization for catalysis and secondarily as a source for commercial “digestives” containing enzyme s  for con- sumption. Yoshimaru et al.  2000  describes improvement of the digestion in pigs by using microencapsulated aspartase from Aspergillus usamii and A. shiro-usamii. The production of these enzymes occurs by batch liquid or solid semisolid fermentations. The choice is often deter- mined by considerations for maximum quantity, activity, purity, or for cost and efﬁciency.  5.2 Organic Ingredients Production  Organic acids, vitamins, nonvolatile and volatile ﬂavor organic molecules  e.g., vanillin and 2-heptanone  are important compounds in food production and technology. They serve as food ingredients or as precursors for food ingredients. The major organic acids produced and used in the largest volumes function primarily as food acidulants. The means for organic acid and production methods rely on bacteria and fungi. If these ingredients are used as a food ingredient, they must have a GRAS  generally regarded as safe  status. Although the use of Penicillium was the primary source for many organic acids, in recent years Aspergillus niger has become the preferred organism and riboﬂavin oversynthesizing strains of Pichia guilliermondii the preferred source.  5.3 Fermented Foods and Beverages  Industrial yeasts are involved in the production of many foods and drinks. The edible products, cheese and bread, and the potable alcohol products, beer, wine, and spirits, depend on yeast-based fermentation. The techniques of biotechnology developed in recent years enable the engineering of industrial yeasts including the multiploid yeasts, which are extremely difﬁcult to manipulate by traditional genetics. Normal yeasts are unable to completely convert starch to alcohol because of their inability to degrade the starch beyond its branch points. Starch debranching-enzymes and their genes have been identiﬁed and engineered into the industrial yeast. As a result, it is possible to completely convert starch to alcohol, resulting in the production in a single natural step, light beer. Other genes could be incorporated into industrial yeasts to improve the efﬁciencies of manufacture of cheese, bread, wine, and spirits and to make other useful products  Hui and Khachatourians 1995 . New technology development in fermentation can be powerful in contributing to agri-food industries. Kourkoutas et al.  2002  described a high temperature alcoholic fermentation of whey using Kluyvero- myces marxianus cells immobilized on deligniﬁed cellulosic material under batch conditions. They found that volatile byproducts and higher alcohols in very low levels led to a product of improved characteristic aroma. The potential use of various agri-food enzymes in processing raw material for  the production of novel foods and drink represents an untapped resource for fungal biotechnology.  In certain food production schemes, food additives and ingredients obtained through fungal fermentation technology contribute much to aroma and ﬂavors. Fungi grown in either liquid cultures or in solid-state fermentation have the advantages of in situ contribution to the value of foods  see Arora 2004, chapters by Saxsena and Malhotra; Nigam, Robinson, and Singh; and Vinigera-Gonzalez . Several speciﬁc aspects of fungal biotechnology’s contribution to functional attributes including taste and smell of foods are discussed in depth in the following chapters  see: this volume, chapters Castrillo and Ugalde; Agrawal; and Hansen and Jakobsens; see also chapter by Avalos, Arora 2004 .  5.4 Fermentation Technology and Downstream  Processing  Yeasts and ﬁlamentous fungi were traditionally employed in the production of alcoholic beverages and fermented foods over centuries  Hui and Khachatourians 1995; Rajak 2000 . Yeasts  mainly Saccharomyces  have been used worldwide for brewing and baking for thousands of years. Likewise, ﬁlamentous fungi have been traditionally used for preparing mold-ripened cheeses  mainly Penicillium spp.  in Europe and soybean-based fermented foods  mainly Aspergillus spp.  in the Orient. On the other hand, edible mushrooms  such as Agaricus  have been used worldwide for direct consumption since times immemorial  Hudler 1998; Pointing and Hyde 2001; Rajak 2000; Singh and Aneja 1999 . With passing time, these fermentation techniques were scaled up and made more efﬁcient with respect to engineering theories and practices. Main outcomes of the evolution of food processing and production activities, have been the introduction of interdisciplinary natural and engineering concepts, for example, better equipment design, heat and mass transfer systems, feedstock supplementation system, product recovery, efﬂuent and waste management  Thassitou and Arvanitoyannis 2001, for an extended coverage see: this volume, chapter by Schliephak et al. , computerization and automation, and ﬁnally hazard analysis critical control points  HACCP  and quality assurance. Ancillary to the above developments has been the area of food packaging storage, transportation, and distribution system design. Overall, there has been incredible integration of food science, microbiolo- gical, engineering, and industrial R&D activities.  Fungi, because of their unique mycelial structures have challenged bioengineers to reinvent fermenters and down- stream processing instruments. Basic research aimed at better fungal uses for food production have synergistically aided many other aspects of fungal biotechnology from life sciences molecules to a variety of polymer sciences. More recently advances in natural science and engineering have led to the application of biosensors; computer control, logistics, and real  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

From the above, at least 20 are conﬁrmed producers of food related mycotoxins and antinutrients  see: this volume, Chapter 6 . Many vegetables, fruits, and seeds lose their nutritive and other qualitative values due to loss of moisture, infection with spoilage microorganisms, and senescence. These types of wastage can occur during transport, handling, and redistribution. Food crops and their products can be infected with single or multiple species of toxigenic fungi. As a result food commodities can be contaminated inadvertently with levels of toxic metabolite s  often ranging in PPB to PPM levels  Jones et al. 1995; Koshinsky and Khachatourians 1992; Koshinsky and Khachatourians 1994 .  Exposure to these metabolites whether singly or  in combination results in toxopathological manifestations and even death. Even at subthreshold levels, multiple mycotoxins, by their interactions with multiple sites and targets often produce devastating synergistic effects on living cells and whole animals  Koshinsky and Khachatourians 1992; Koshinsky and Khachatourians 1994; Koshinsky et al. 2000 . The historically signiﬁcant and still prevailing food consumption related threat to public health comes from the fungal alkaloids that lead to ergotism. The fungus, Claviceps purpurea is prevalent in the cool climates where rye is grown. Clavicepes africana has been found to spread through sorghum in North and South America, Australia, and Africa  Bandyopadhyay et al. 1998 . Sorghum is the ﬁfth most important cereal crop in the world.  Huge challenges are posed by mycotoxins such as aﬂatoxins, trichothecenes, and fuminosins that can be addressed by fungal biotechnology. Identiﬁcation of myco- toxin biosynthesis and their genes, mycotoxin catabolism and biotransformation and their genes could have tremendous value. So far, however, breeding of corn and cereal grain plants through conventional genetics for resistance have been attempted but remains unsuccessful  Medianer 1997 . This is possibly due to multiple modes of action of some of these toxins and hence polygenic nature of resistance  Khachatourians 1990; Koshinsky et al. 1998; Woytowich et al. 1997 . Perhaps with the isolation of target speciﬁc genes a better and fuller resistance could be achieved.  Saprophytic and pathogenic fungi are a major detriment to freshness of fruits and vegetables and safety. Application of antifungal peptides and antimicrobial peptides  Nigam et al. chapter in Arora 2004; Woytowich and Khatchatourians 2001; see: this volume, chapter by Ray and Liewen  could signiﬁcantly change our options in management of spoilage  fungi. A new avenue for applied research is the application of genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics towards intervention with fungal developmental genes for enhanced functionality, for controlled ingredient delivery, or spoilage of foods. As the knowledge of the regulation of fungal gene expression advances, is expected that strains will be designed for expression of commodities of high impact in world trade.  it  Recent advances in diagnostic biotechnology have revolutionized the procedures used in the identiﬁcation of food fungi. Biochemical identiﬁcation assays have been miniaturized and through automation and uses of robotics have become faster, reliable, and cost affordable. Rapid identiﬁcation of fungi and yeasts from foods has become less cumbersome because of ease in sequestering of target fungi from the food ingredients and interfering compounds. In addition, biochemical tests which traditionally have been used in the identiﬁcation of yeasts and ﬁlamentous fungi have been greatly aided by the introduction of polymerase chain reaction  PCR  technology.  Research and development work on understanding of fungal presence in food products and processes are advancing rapidly. For the most part, the goal of research in this area is to decrease process costs. However, fungal biotechnology will enable improvement in health and safety related issues of foods such as better shelf life, decreased threats to human health, and increased perceived healthfulness of the food.  7 CONCLUSIONS  Clearly as we move through the 21st century, the prospects for food production, storage, transportation, and processing will change by the same forces that are impacting on all other facets of economy. The beneﬁts of R&D in fungal biotechnology for enhanced food production; security and safety will beneﬁt everyone. The support for fostering a research environment conducive to the above goal must therefore be responsibilities for everyone whether in the public or private sector. Fungal biotechnology can ensure harnessing of the potential of fungi while ensuring our foods are free from fungal pathogens, mycotoxins, mold allergens, and other problems of quality loss during storage. Fungal biotechnology has the potential of being a primary driver of world food production and its quality.  REFERENCES  Arora DK ed.  2004 . Handbook of Fungal Biotechnology. 2nd ed.

Ng The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong, China  1  INTRODUCTION  2 ACID-FERMENTED LEAVENED BREAD  AND PANCAKES  Fermentation is a process in which complex compounds including carbohydrates, proteins, and fats are broken down to simpler forms under aerobic or anaerobic conditions and have been used by the food industry for centuries. The products of fermentation can be used as a food source itself or as an additive. Fermentation has many roles including detoxiﬁcation, adding nutritional value, creating aromas or ﬂavors, reducing cooking time and so fuel consumption, and some fermented foods may even have therapeutic value. A knowledge of microbiology, genetics, and biochemistry is important in the food fermentation industry as yeasts, molds, and bacteria play an integral role in food fermentation. these microorganisms by genetic manipulation may result in higher-quality fermented food and a considerable amount of work has been done in the screening of useful microorganisms. Further develop- ment of toxin measurement, prevention of food spoilage, nutritional analysis, ﬂavor and taste assessment, and addition of colors and additives are underway to attain the maximum potential from this process. Many of the issues are covered in a book edited by Steinkraus  1996  and in another two edited by Joshi and Pandey  1999 .  fermentation equipment,  Improvement of  Although some fungi are pathogenic to plants and animals and thus bring about economic losses, many of them are beneﬁcial to mankind especially in food production. In this chapter, different fermented food with fungal involvement in the fermentation process are described. It is worth noting that different countries may have some similar indigenous fermented food as well as varieties that are unique to that country.  types of  These are highly accepted as food. The acid fermentation makes the food resistant to spoilage and development of food toxins and less likely to transfer pathogens.   a  Indian Idli: Idli is the Indian equivalent of the Western sourdough bread. It differs from sourdough bread as ﬁrst leavening is achieved by bacterial instead of yeast activity and secondly wheat or rye is not used as source of protein to retain carbon dioxide during leavening. Idli is prepared by bacterial fermentation of batters produced from washed, soaked rice, and dehulled black gram. After fermentation overnight at around 308C, the batter is poured into cups of an idli steamer, placed in a covered pan and steamed for about 15 min until the idli cakes are soft and spongy. The texture and ﬂavor can be achieved by replacing rice by other cereal grains, and a variety of legumes can be used instead of black gram. The lactic acid bacterium Leuconostoc mesenteroides is important for batter leavening. Yeasts are not essential, although when added they will contribute to leavening, ﬂavor, and increasing levels of the vitamins thiamine and riboﬂavin. The yeasts used in fermentation for production of idli include Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Debaromyces hansenii, Hansenula anomala, Trichosporon beigelii, Oidium lactis, Torulopsis holmii, Torulopsis candida, and Trichosporon pullulans  Soni and Sandhu 1999 ;  b  Philippine Puto: Puto is similar to Indian Idli except that there are no legumes in Puto, so the ﬂavoring is excluded. It is produced by grinding soaked rice grains in water, adding sugar and a starter culture containing L. mesenteroides, Streptococcus faecalis, and S. cerevisiae, so allowing the mixture to ferment. This fermentation lasts for about 15 h, before adding sodium hydroxide  lye  and more  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   sugar. A second fermentation continues for about 5 h before steaming for 30 min. S. cerevisiae is a minor component until the ﬁnal stage of the fermentation in which it can reach as much as 18% of the total population, resulting in a small amount of ethanol. The yeast together with L. mesenteroides may play an important role in leavening the batter  Rosario 1987 ;  c  Sri Lankan Hopper: Rice and wheat ﬂour, either alone or mixed, are added to sugar, coconut water, coconut toddy, and inoculum  a collection of yeast and acid-producing bacteria  or baker’s yeast  S. cerevisiae . After the mixture has formed into a stiff batter, it is covered with a piece of wet cloth and allowed to stand at room temperature for about 12 h to allow carbon dioxide to be produced by the yeast. Following this fermentation, coconut milk and salt are added. Sodium bicarbonate may also be introduced to raise the batter during cooking. The mixture is then poured into an oiled hot pan and baked for about 4 min. A longer fermentation period produces a better ﬂavor. Nutritionally, the yeast provides proteins and B vitamins, and the coconut supplies some proteins, long-chain fatty acids, and ﬂavor  Ekmon and Nagodawthana 1977 ;  d  Ethiopian Enjera: Enjera, also known as injera, wanjera, manjeriya, and kissra habashiya, is made from teff  grain of a type of grass related to love-grass , wheat, barley, sorghum, corn or a mixture of them. It is a fermented sour leavened pancake-like bread. The teff ﬂour is mixed with water and starter culture before being incubated for 1 – 3 days to produce a paste. The fermented paste is then mixed with water, boiled, and cooled down before baking for several minutes to give enjera. A number of fungi including Aspergillus, Candida, Hormodendrum, Penicillium, Pullaria, Rhodotorula, and Torulopsis species have been identiﬁed as being used in this process. It has been suggested that Candida guilliermondii is the primary fermenting organism although evidence has been presented that gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria may be responsible for the initial fermentation  Stewart and Getachew 1962 ;  e  Ghanian Kenkey: Kenkey appears in the form of sour maize dough balls or cylinders enclosed by maize husks or plantain leaves. To prepare kenkey, maize kernels are washed and soaked in water before being ground into ﬁne particles. The powder is moistened with water, packed, and covered tightly to ensure anaerobic conditions before leaving to ferment for 1 – 3 days. A portion of the dough is then precooked, while salt is added to the rest of the mixture. The precooked dough is mixed with the remaining dough, made into balls and wrapped with maize husks or plantain leaves prior to thorough cooking. This fermentation process is uncontrolled and initially involves Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Rhizopus species. Saccharo- myces sp. have also been detected and as yeasts esterify organic acids and alcohols, they give a distinctive aroma to kenkey. Bacteria are also involved in this process. Gram- negative, catalase-positive bacteria appear in the beginning but soon disappear, to be replaced by gram-positive, catalase- negative bacteria. This microbial activity contributes to its nutritive value by increasing the content of thiamine, riboﬂavin, and protein in kenkey  Christian 1970 ;  f  Nigerian Gari: Gari is a fermented cassava product. Peeled  cassava roots are washed, grated, and packed into a bag that is weighted to squeeze the juice out. Natural fermentation is allowed to proceed for several days resulting in a lower cyanide content and softer mushy extreme of the cassava. The yeasts including Candida sp. together with bacteria  L. mesenteroides  are responsible for the ﬂavor and changes in acidity during fermentation  Oneyekwere et al. 1989 ;  vii  Nigerian Kamu: Kamu is a starch-cake food produced from fermented millet. The yeasts, S. cerevisiae and Candida krusei and the lactic acid bacteria are used in fermentation. The mixture of soaked millet grains, pepper, ginger, and fruit is wetmilled with water and sieved. Kamu is the sediment obtained after the ﬁltered liquor is allowed to settle for several hours and can be used to make porridge  Oyeyiola 1991 ;  h  Nigerian Ogi: Ogi is made by fermenting cereals including maize, sorghum, and millet that not only give them different ﬂavors, but also result in different colors. Fungi and bacteria are included in the fermentation. Aspergillus, Cephalo- sporium, Cerecospora, Fusarium, Oospora, Penicillium, Rhizopus, Rhodotorula, and Saccharomyces are fungi associated with fermenting maize. The yeasts contribute to the ﬂavor of Ogi. The bacteria involved are Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, Acetobacter sp., Coryne- bacterium sp., and Lactobacillus plantarium, which is the predominant organism producing lactic acid  Akinrele 1970 ;  i  Sudanese Kisra: Kisra is bread or stiff porridge prepared by fermenting sorghum ﬂour. To prepare Kisra, sorghum grains are subjected to dry milling and sieving before fortiﬁcation with wheat or millet grains. The mixture is then milled, and mixed with water before a starter culture is added to start fermentation. After half a day at around 378C, water is then added before baking. Many microbes are involved in this process, Yeasts, Candida intermedia, D. hansenii, and S. cerevisiae multiply throughout the fermentation. The the fungal genera Aspergillus, Penicillium, molds of Fusarium, and Rhizopus are also found. The bacteria involved include Erwinia ananas, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Acetobacter sp. Dough leavening is caused by Acetobacter converting alcohol to acetic acid and yeasts produce CO2  Mohammed et al. 1991 .  3 FERMENTED MILK PRODUCTS  The advantages include easy production, improved keeping quality, better digestibility and nutritive value, and thera- peutic potential. Only the acid-tolerant bacteria can grow during milk fermentation.   a  Egyptian Kishk is a fermented milk-wheat mixture that is stored as dried balls. To prepare kishk, wheat grains are softened by boiling, air-dried, and then ground. Milk is added to the ground wheat to produce a paste that is rolled into balls. Spices may be added to the balls before they are dried in the sun. The numbers of molds, yeasts, and bacteria have been examined. Penicillium and Mucor molds are found up to 21 concentration but 103 g bacteria make up the highest numbers, which also contribute  21. Yeasts are found in 104 – 106 g  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   21  Mahmoud to the aroma with Lactobacilli found in 108 g 1977 ;  b  Russian Keﬁr is an acidic, mildly alcoholic milk made from cow, goat, or sheep milk that is able to keep longer. The predominant yeasts involved in fermentation include T. holmii and S. delbrueckii although Candida keﬁr and S. cerevisiae are the yeasts that are commonly isolated  Marshall 1984 . During the preparation of keﬁr, Keﬁr grains are added to pasteurized milk and incubated at 18 – 258C for 1 – 2 days. The mixture contains Keﬁr grains, which consist of yeasts and lactic acid bacteria held together with the help of a polysaccharide gum and these are removed by sieving;  c  Russian Koumiss: This is produced from ass milk, camel milk, or mare milk. Lactic acid bacteria and the lactose fermenting yeasts Torula kumiss and Saccharomyces lactis cause fermentation  Kosikowski 1982 . Fresh milk is ﬁrst heated at about 908C for 5 min and cooled before inoculation of starter and incubation at 288C. The incubate is agitated every 24 h and then cooled to form koumiss. Koumiss has both nutritive and therapeutic values and has been reported to be effective in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis in Russia;  d  Lebanese Labneh: This is formed from goat or sheep milk. Lactose-fermenting yeasts and lactic acid bacteria cause fermentation;  e  Cheese: Cheese-making comprises several steps: preparation of milk; addition of starter and ripening  souring , renneting and coagulation, and ripening  curing of cheese curd into the ﬁnal product. Molds such as Penicillium roqueforti, P. glauceum, P. camenberti, Geo- trichum candidum, and Mucor racemosus are used in ripening. Different combinations of molds and bacteria are used for different varieties of cheese;  f  Indian Dahi: Dahi is produced by lactic fermentation of milk as a bioproduct of alcoholic fermentation by yeast. Raw milk is boiled for a period of a few seconds up to 10 min, then cooled before addition of starter and incubation at room temperature for 8 – 16 h  Baisya and Bose 1975 .  4 ALCOHOLIC FOOD AND BEVERAGES   MOSTLY CEREAL-BASED   These are primitive beers and wines prepared by villages in the developing countries. They are cloudy slurries containing residues and microorganisms including yeasts, and hence are a source of B vitamins, proteins, amino acids, and calories.   a  Ethiopian Tej: This is a home-processed honey wine fermented by Saccharomyces species present in the environment that convert sugars to ethanol. To make Ethiopian tej, honey, water, and hop stems are fermented in a pot for about 1 week at high ambient temperature or 2 weeks at low temperature with stirring daily. The mixture is then ﬁltered through cloth several times and the ﬁnal ﬁltrate is collected  Vogel and Gobezie 1977 ;  b  Kenyan Urwaga: This is a slightly sour drink prepared from bananas, maize, millet, or sorghum. Yeasts and lactic acid bacteria are involved in the process of fermentation. To make Urwaga, green bananas are ripened in a covered pit lined with banana  leaves. The peeled bananas are mixed with grass and the juice is forced out by squeezing by hand. A roasted ﬂour mixture made from maize, sorghum and millet is mixed with the banana juice and fermented in the covered pit for half a day or  c  African Kafﬁr  Kafﬁrcorn  one  Harkishor 1977 ;  Sorghum  Beer: This has a sour, yogurt-like ﬂavor. The brewing process involves lactic acid fermentation and an alcoholic fermentation. Lactic acid fermentation by lactic acid bacteria causes souring. The yeast S. cerevisiae is used for alcoholic fermentation  Hesseltine 1979 ;  d  Nigerian Pito: This is a slightly bitter, sweet-sour beverage with a fruity ﬂavor produced by fermentation of maize or sorghum. The molds Rhizopus oryzae, Aspergillus ﬂavus, Penicillium funiculosum, and Penicillium citrinum play an undeﬁned role in Pito fermentation. The bacteria Leuconotoc sp. and Lactobacillus sp. and the yeasts Saccharomyces and Candida spp. are also present during fermentation. Amylases from the germinated maize or sorghum grains and the molds present on the grains cause hydrolysis of starch in the grains to form maltose and glucose. The yeasts ferment the sugars to form ethanol. The lactic acid bacteria produce lactic acid  Ekundayo 1977 ;  e  South America fermented maize chichi: This has a ciderlike ﬂavor. Molds including Aspergillus and Penicillium spp., yeasts including S. cerevisiae, S. apiculata, S. pastorianus, and Mycoderma vini, and lactic acid bacteria are present. Amylase needed for hydrolysis of starch is produced from germinated maize or from human saliva. Chicha produced using saliva reportedly has a better ﬂavor  Gomez 1949 ;  f  Mexican Tesguino: This is prepared by fermentation of germinated maize or maize stalk juice. To make Mexican Tesguino, germinated maize kernels or maize cane stems are ﬁrst mixed with water and boiled. Catalysts, which include yeasts, vitamins, enzymes, or growth factors, are added before fermentation. S. cerevisiae, C. guilliermondii, and H. anomala are important in the alcoholic fermentation of Tesquino  Lappe and Ulloa 1989 ;  g  Philippine Basi: This is sugar cane wine. Sugar cane juice is boiled and fermented with a mixture of molds, yeasts, and bacteria in an earthenware jar for 6 months to 1 year  Sakai and Caldo 1984 ;  h  Philippine Tapuy: This is a sweet rice wine. To make Philippine Tapuy, the rice is washed, cooked, cooled, and placed in a clay pot. Powdered bubod is then inoculated for fermentation which lasts for 2 – 3 days. The rice and the liquid collected on top can be consumed separately or together. The amylase-producing yeasts Saccharomyces uvarum and Endomycopsis  Saccharomycopsis  and the lactic acid bacteria are the dominant organisms present  Sakai and Caldo 1983 ;  i  Japanese Sake: This is a rice wine made from steamed rice overgrown with Aspergillus oryzae mycelium. The yeast Saccharomyces sake also plays a role. The process of sake brewing ﬁrst involves the preparation of polished, steeped, and steamed rice, followed by the preparation of starter consisting of yeast and lactic acid bacteria. Consecutive addition of more steamed rice, rice koji  A. oryzae  and water are then followed by the main fermentation, which takes place in an open system without the exclusion of nonstarter microorganisms. The combination of  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   types of yeast  hydrolysis of starch by A. oryzae and slow fermentation by the yeast Saccharomyces sake at a temperature below 108C is referred to as parallel fermentation, which gives rise to the high  15 – 20%  ethanol content of sake  Murakami 1972 ;  j  Tea Fungus Kombucha: Several including C. guilliermondiil, Pichia membranefaciens, Saccharomyces sp., and Torulopsis formata are present in Japanese tea fungus. Candida obtuse and Kloeckera apiculata are present in Formosan tea fungus  Kozaki et al. 1972 . Reiss  1994  reported that tea fungus consists of Acetobacter xylimum and the following yeasts in symbiosis: Pichia sp., Saccharomyces ludwigii, and Saccharomyces pombe. The yeasts produce ethanol from the sugars added and Acetobacter oxidizes ethanol to acetic acid. It is believed that tea fungus enhances hepatic detoxiﬁcation and inhibits tumorigenesis;  k  Chinese Spirits, Wines, and Beers: Some are made from barley or wheat and brans overgrown with Aspergillus while others are made from rice or rice bean overgrown with Mucor or Rhizopus  Chen and Ho 1989 ;  l  Chinese Lao-Chao: This is made from fermentation of glutinous rice. The fungi and yeasts grown on rice ﬂour include R. oryzae, Rhizopus chinensis, and Amylomyces rauxii  Wang and Hesseltine 1970 . The yeasts ferment the starch;  m  Indian Ruhi: This is prepared by fermentation of boiled rice. Boiled rice is spread, cooled, and mixed with the inoculum, which is comprised of molds belonging to genera Rhizopus and Mucor and yeasts  Dahiya and Prabhu 1977 . It is then poured into a basket. The rice liqueﬁes upon fermentation and the liquid is collected in a pot beneath the basket.  n  Indian Madhu: This is made by fermentation of boiled rice by lactic acid bacterial spp., Mucor and Rhizopus spp.  Dahiya and Prabhu 1977 . Sugars formed by the hydrolysis of starch are fermented to form alcohol and lactic acid;  o  Whisky: S. cerevisiae is involved. Corn, rye, and barley are used. There are several types  a  Scotch whisky produced from water and malted barley to which only whole grains of other cereals may be added.  b  Irish whisky made from unmalted barley. Compared with Scotch whisky it has higher ethanol content and a stronger ﬂavor but lacks the peat characteristics.  c  Canadian whisky with a light ﬂavor and made from corn, rye, and barley malt. The spirits must be aged for a minimum of three years.  d  American rye whisky containing at least 51% rye, American corn whisky containing at least 80% corn, American light whisky containing a large percentage of corn, and Bourbon whisky containing at least 51% corn  Russell and Stewart 1999 .  5 FRUIT-BASED ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES  A variety of alcoholic beverages is made from fruits. The quality of fruit wine depends on the fruit variety, maturity of fruit, yeast strains, other viniﬁcation practices, and the method of preservation.   a  Mango Wine: Mangoes are ﬁrst pulped, Pectinase is then added followed by fermentation with S. cerevisiae var. ellipsoideus  Joshi et al. 1999 ;  b  Jambal wine: Crushed  Jambal fruits are diluted and the must ameliorated with cane sugar. Diammonium hydrogen phosphate, sulfur dioxide, and pectinol enzyme are introduced, then follows fermentation with the yeast S. cerevisiae  Joshi et al. 1999 ;  c  Coconut toddy: This is produced by naturally fermenting the inﬂuorescence sap of coconut palm in open pots for 2 days. Candida spp., Kloeckera javanice, Saccharomyces chevielier, S. exiguus, S. marxianus, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Pichia ohmeri are involved in the fermentation process;  d  Palm wine: S. cerevisiae is the yeast usually instrumental in including Schizosaccharomyces fermentation. Other fungi pombe, Candida, Mycoderma, Aspergillus, Mucor, Pichia sp., and Rhizopus sp. are detected together with lactic acid bacteria in Nigerian wine  Faparusi 1977 . Atputharajah et al.  1986  identiﬁed Candida, Pichia and Saccharomyces species as the major yeasts responsible for the natural fermentation of coconut palm sap. The wine is a milky suspension of live bacteria and yeasts. It has a sweet taste and exhibits vigorous effervescence due to fermentation. The wine is made from sap collected from a cut on middle-aged ﬂowering palm trees. It is collected in earthenware pots containing the bacteria and yeasts and any left-over toddy;  e  Indian jackfruit wine: To make jackfruit wine, seeds are removed from peeled ripe jackfruits and the pulp soaked and ground in a bamboo basket. The extract is collected in earthenware pots. A small amount of fermented juice is added as inoculum and the extract is allowed to ferment at 18 – 308C for a week. The yeast involved in fermentation appears to be Endomycopsis  Dahiya and Prabhu 1977 ;  f  Date wines: Different types of date wine involve different fungi that include Torulopsis, Saccharo- myces, and Candida spp. and also different bacterial species including Acetobacter, Bacillus, Gluconobacter, Klebsiella, and Leuconostoc. Dates are either soaked in lukewarm water and allowed to ferment for about 4 days, or boiled to form a syrup which is then allowed to ferment for about 3 days in a cloth bag of either sorghum malt or a mixture of ginger and cinnamon immersed in the syrup  Ali and Dirar 1984 ;  g  Plum wine: To prepare plum wine, water and starter culture are added to the plums and fermented for about 10 days before juice. The yeast S. pombe is used for pressing for deacidiﬁcation of the acidic plum pulp. S. cerevisiae is used for alcohol production  Joshi et al. 1999 ;  h  Mead  honey wine : S. cerevisiae is used for alcoholic fermentation in the production of mead and wine from apples, pears and plums where honey is utilized as a source of sugar  Joshi et al. 1999 ;  i  Kiwi fruit wine: Kiwi fruit juice is clariﬁed with the help of pectolytic enzyme with the resulting generation of an intense fruity aroma. The juice is highly acidic and has low sugar content, making it necessary to ameliorate the juice. S. cerevisiae is added to the must before fementation. The low ascorbic acid content concentration  Joshi et al. 1999 ;  j  Apricot wine, litchi wine, sparkling plum wine: S. cerevisiae is involved.  a  Apricot wine: made by diluting apricot pulp with water  1:2 by volume , addition of 0.5% pectinol and 0.1% diammonium hydrogen phosphate and fermentation with S. cerevisiae,  b  litchi wine: peeled litchi fruits are dipped in sugar solution for  is preserved by SO2 at  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   4 h at 508C. The fruits are pulped and water is added. Yeast is then added to the litchi juice and fermentation allowed to proceed, and  c  sparkling plum wine: plums preserved in sodium benzoate, a sugar concentration of 1.5%, a diammonium hydrogen phosphate concentration of 2% and the yeast S. cerevisiae strain UCD 595 are used to yield optimal results  Joshi et al. 1999 ;  k  Brandy: This refers to the distillate obtained by distillation of wine or any other fermented fruit juice or residue. Grape products are most commonly used, but apple, peach, plum, cashew apple, and apricot products can also be used. Various yeasts are involved in fermentation including S. cerevisiae, S. capensis, S. ludwigii, S. rosei, and S. uvarum. SO2 is not used in order to prevent formation of sulfuric acid which would considerably lower the pH  Joshi et al. 1999 .  6 SOY SAUCES  It is a dark-colored liquid that adds a meatlike and salty ﬂavor as well as color to food. It is made by the hydrolysis of soybeans with or without wheat added.   a  Japanese Shoyu: The molds A. oryzae or A. soyae are involved in fermentation. The yeasts Saccharomyces rouxii, Torulopsis versatile, or T. etchellsii are also involved. Salted cooked soybeans are mixed with ground roasted wheat and the mixture is inoculated with A. oryzae seed culture. Pure cultures of Pediococcus soyae and S. rouxii are added at the start and again one month later. Fermentation proceeds at ambient temperature for a period of up to 3 years. Filtration, pasteurization, and bottling are then carried out  Yokotsuka 1977 ;  b  Korean soy sauce Kanjang: Molds of the genera Aspergillus, Mucor, Penicillium, Rhizopus, and Sco- pulariopsis are involved in brine fermentation  Lee and Cho 1971 . The bacteria Bacillus subtilis, B. pumilis, and L. mesenteroides, and the yeasts Rhodotorula ﬂava, S. rouxii, and Torulopsis dattila are also present. Steamed soybeans are crushed and left to mold without addition of inoculum. Fermentation is allowed to proceed for a couple of weeks, before ﬁltration, pasteurization, and bottling  Lee and Cho 1971 ;  c  Chinese jiang: Molds of the Aspergillus type overgrow soaked, steamed soybeans coated with wheat ﬂour. Fermentation is carried out at high temperatures and in the presence of salt brine;  d  Malaysian soy sauce Kicap: Soybeans are boiled, mixed with wheat ﬂour, spread on bamboo trays to allow fungal growth without addition of inoculum, transferred to earthenware jars, covered with salt brine and incubated in the sun. After 3 months of fermentation, the sauce can be extracted. Brine can be added to the remaining mash for further extractions. Sugar, molasses, caramel, monosodium glutamate, and benzoic acid may be added to the sauce. A. oryzae, A. soyae, A. nigar, A. ﬂavus, Rhizopus sp., and Pencillium sp. are involved in solid-substrate fermentation in soy sauce factories  Ong 1977 ;  e  Indonesian soy sauce Kecap: The molds Aspergillus and Rhizopus spp. and various  yeasts are involved in fermentation  Poesponegoro and Tanuwidjaja 1977 .  7 FERMENTED SOYBEAN PASTES  The three soybean pastes described in the following are used in making soup or side dishes. Japanese Miso and Indonesian Tauco have greater economic signiﬁcance than Korean Doenjang and Kochuzang.   a  Japanese Miso: This is prepared by fermentation of soybeans, with or without addition of rice or barley, using A. oryzae or A. soyae and S. rouxii  Hesseltine and Shibasaki 1961 ;  b  Korean Doenjang and Kochujang: A. oryzae, Mucor sp., Penicillium sp., Rhizopus sp., R. ﬂava, and T. dattila are some of the essential microorganisms used in fermentation  Chang et al. 1977 ;  c  Indonesian Tauco: A. oryzae, Rhizopus oligosporus, and Hansenula sp. are involved. Soaked soybeans are boiled, dehulled, washed, boiled again, and covered to encourage fungal growth. Alternatively, they are inoculated with ragi tempe and mixed with rice ﬂour, and incubated for several days following the second boiling. They are then dried in the sun, put in salt brine, fermented for 3 – 4 weeks before the addition of palm sugar, cooked, then bottled or packed  Winarno et al. 1977 .  8 LEGUME-BASED FERMENTED FOODS  Legumes are used for food production mainly in Asia. Fermentation improves digestibility of legumes by hydro- lyzing proteins, and breaking down antinutritional molecules like trypsin inhibitors.   a  Tempe  Tempeh  Kedele: This is a fermented soybean- based food, popular with American vegetarians and also available in Canada, the West Indies, Holland, Indonesia, and Malaysia. It is supplied in the form of a white, moldy cake. The beans are cleaned, soaked, dehulled, partially cooked, drained, inoculated, packed in banana leaves or perforated plastic bags, and incubated for 2 days to produce tempe. A variety of fungi have been isolated from Malaysian tempe including various species of Aspergillus, Mucor, Penicillium, and Rhizopus by Yeoh and Merican  1977 . In tempe of other origins bacteria such as Bacillus and Micrococcus sp. may also be present;  b  Tempelike foods from broad beans and cowpeas: Rhizopus arrhizus is used in the production of tempe products from broad beans. R. oligosporus, R. oryzae, and R. arrhizus are used for tempe products from cowpeas. Different Rhizopus species give products with different aromas and ﬂavors  Djurtoft and Jensen 1977 ;  c  Oncom  Ontjon : A mixed culture of microorganisms with Rhizopus or Neurospora species predominating is used to produce this cakelike product formed by fermenting peanut presscake. Peanut presscake is soaked, drained, crumbled, mixed thoroughly with solid waste from tapioca production, steamed, cooled and formed into ﬂat cakes, inoculated with  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   molds, covered with banana leaves, and fermented at room temperature for about 2 days to form oncom  Fardiaz 1987 ;  d  West African Dawadawa: This is prepared by fermenting locust beans and consumed mainly in West Africa. Yeasts, spore forming bacilli and lactic acid bacteria are involved in the fermentation. The pulp is removed from the seeds before they are boiled and then dehulled. The dehulled seeds are soaked, washed, cooked, spread on a tray, and covered with leaves then fermented for 2 – 3 days  Padmaja and George 1999 .  e  Chinese Chee-fan: This is in solid form, prepared from soybean whey curd in China and eaten like cheese. Mucor spp. and A. glauca are involved in fermentation  Padmaja and George 1999 ;  f  Chinese Meitauza: This is Chinese soybean cake. It can be fried in oil or cooked with vegetables. Actinomucor elegans is the microorganism involved in fermentation  Padmaja and George 1999 ;  g  Chinese Sufu  Tau-hu-yi : Soybean milk is made from ground soybeans strained through cheesecloth and boiled. CaSO4 or MgSO4 is added to induce curdling  protein coagulation . The cake remaining after pressing is known as tofu. Sufu is a highly ﬂavored creamy bean paste prepared by growing soybean curd with Actinomucor, Mucor, or Rhizopus species and fermenting the curd in a salt brine rice wine mixture. Red sufu is colored with a derivative from the culture of Monascus purpureus on rice while the white sufu is untreated  Wai 1929 ;  h  Korean Meju: This is soybean paste used for seasoning. A. oryzae and Rhizopus sp. are involved in  i  Javan fermentation  Padmaja and George 1999 ; Bongkrek: This is coconut presscake popular in Central Java. R. oligosporus is involved in fermentation  Padmaja and George 1999 .  j  Indian Papadem: This is solid crisp condiment made from black gram  Phaseolus mungo  in India. Saccharomyces sp. is involved  Padmaja and George 1999 ;  k  Indian Warries: Dehulled black gram grains are ground to a paste, spiced, and molded into small balls. These are then fermented for 4 – 10 days at room temperature and air-dried. The yeasts Candida spp., Debaryomyces hansenii, H. anomala, Rhodotorula lactosa, S. cerevisiae, and Wingea roberstii are involved in warri fermentation in addition to bacteria  Soni and Sandhu 1999 ;  l  Indian Dosa: This is a fried pancake-like staple food of South India prepared by fermenting a paste formed from rice and dehulled black gram. S. cerevisiae is the most predominant yeast involved in fermentation followed by D. hansenii, H. anomala, Oosporidium margaritiferum, T. pullulans, Kluyerveromyces marxianus, Candida kefyr, and C. krusei. Bacterial species belonging to Leuconostoc, Bacillus, and Streptococcus genera are also involved  Soni and Sandhu 1999 ;  m  Yukiwari natto: This is a kind of fermented whole soybean product made by mixing Itohiki natto with salt and rice koji. Rice koji, prepared by using A. oryzae, is the source of enzymes to hydrolyze the soybean components in fermentation, produced by A. oryzae. Itohiki natto is produced by inoculating soybeans which have been soaked, steamed and cooled  with Bacillus natto, and allowing fermentation to occur for about a day at 40 – 458C  Kiuchi et al. 1976 .  9 CEREAL-BASED FERMENTED FOOD  Cereals including wheat and rice form the largest class of food. Bread is the most commonly found cereal-based fermented food.   a  Chinese Minchin: This is made from wheat gluten and used as a solid condiment. The fungal species involved in fermentation include Aspergillus sp., Chadosporium sp., Fusarium syncephalastum, and Paecilomyces sp.  Padmaja and George 1999 ;  b  Chinese red rice  Anka : This is produced by fermenting rice with various strains of M. purpureus Went. It is used to color foods such as ﬁsh, rice wine, red soybean cheese, pickled vegetables, and salted meats. To make Anka, polished rice is washed, steamed, cooled, inoculated with M. purpureas, and allowed to ferment for a few weeks. Anka has been reported to be effective in treating indigestion and dysentery  Su and Wang 1977 ;  c  Jalabies: These are syrup-ﬁlled confectionery available in India, Nepal, and Pakistan made from wheat ﬂour. Saccharomyces bayanus and bacteria are involved in fermentation  Padmaja and George 1999 ;  d  Indian Kanji: This is made from rice and carrots. It is a sour liquid added to vegetables.

H. anomala, C. tropicalis, C. guilliermondii, and G. candidum are involved in fermentation  Padmaja and George 1999 . The prevalence of bacteria and yeasts in Indian fermented foods during different seasons varies. Yeasts such as Candida vortiovaarai, C. krusei, and Kluyveromyces marxianus are frequently in the winter. H. anomala, P. membranefaciens, present S. cerevisiae, and T. beigelii are present in both summer and winter  Soni and Sandhu 1999 .  10 MIXED FERMENTED FOOD  They may give a higher protein content and a better balanced ratio of amino acids.  Nigerian Burukutu: This is a creamy drink made from sorghum and cassava. Candida sp. and S. cerevisiae are involved in addition to lactic acid bacteria  Padmaja and George 1999 .  11 TUBER CROP-BASED FERMENTED  FOOD  Tuber crops include cassava, yams, taros, potatoes, and sweet potatoes. With the exception of cassava, tuber crops keep well and hence not many fermented products are prepared.   a  African Fufu: This is made from cassava roots and eaten with soup, sauce, or stew. Peeled cassava roots are  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   washed, cut up, soaked in water to release HCN into water, disintegrated, and sieved. The ﬁltered starchy particles are allowed to settle and collected, rolled into balls, cooked, and formed into a paste called fufu. S. cerevisiae and various bacteria are involved in the fermentation  Padmaja and George 1999 ;  b  West African Gari: This is made from cassava roots and eaten as a staple food. Candida sp. and bacteria are involved in fermentation. Roots are fermented, broken up, sun-dried, milled into ﬂour and made into a paste with boiling water before consumption  Padmaja and George 1999 .  c  Nigerian Lafun: This is a ﬁne, powdery cassava product. Candida sp. and bacteria are involved in fermenta- tion  Padmaja and George 1999 ;  d  Indonesian Tape: This is a staple food made from cassava roots. To make Tape, cassava roots are peeled, cut up, boiled to soften, cooled, spread in trays, inoculated, covered with banana leaves, and fermented for a couple of days. The microorganisms involved in fermentation include S. cerevisiae, H. anomala, R. oryzae, Mucor sp., and Endomycopsis ﬁbuliger  Padmaja and George 1999 ;  e  Hawaiian Poi: This is made from taro corms. It is a semisolid dish served with ﬁsh or meat. Lactobacilli and Candida vini and G. candidum are involved in the fermentation process which is carried out for 1 – 3 days at room temperature  Padmaja and George 1999 .  12 FERMENTED FISH PRODUCTS  Fermented ﬁsh products, with their characteristic ﬂavors, introduce variety to the South-East Asian diet.   a  Japanese katsuobushi: This is made from ﬁsh and used for seasoning. A. glaucus is involved in the fermentation  Graikoski 1973 ;  b  Cambodian Phaak or Mamchas: This is a fermented paste produced from eviscerated salted ﬁsh. Glutinous rice pretreated with yeast is also added to the ﬁsh  Padmaja and George 1999 ;  c  Vietnamese Nuoc-mam: This is a brown liquid produced by fermentation of small marine or fresh water ﬁsh that are placed in earthenware vessels buried in the ground for several months. Bacteria and yeasts contribute to proteolysis and ﬂavor. Enzymes from A. oryzae can be used for reduced fermentation time to increase yield of nuoc-mam  Richard 1959 .  13 SALTED SEAFOODS  Seafoods including ﬁsh are nutritious and popular as food. However, they are highly perishable. Processes such as salting are used to preserve seafoods.  Korean Jeotkal: Fish such as herring and sardines, shrimps, cuttle ﬁsh, oysters, and clams are salted and stored to allow aging. Halophilic bacteria exhibiting protease, RNA -phosphodiesterase activities play a role. depolymerase, and 5 Saccharomyces and Torulopsis become dominant about 40 days after aging when halophytic bacteria disappear  Lee et al. 1977 . Differences in ﬂavor between different types of jeotkal are attributed to variations in the content of free amino acids  0  0  -mononucleotides. The protein content of jeotkal is and 5 higher than that in vegetable foods while the vitamin content is dependent on the type of jeotkal.  14 FERMENTED MEAT PRODUCTS   SAUSAGES   The starter culture used in meat fermentation may have bacteria, the yeasts Deboryomyces hansanii and Candida famata and the fungi Penicillium chrysogenum and P. nalgiovense. Yeasts encourage color development and improve aroma in sausages. Molds contribute to the characteristic aroma. During fermentation, the fall in pH due to glycolysis by lactic acid bacteria helps to preserve the fermented product and inhibit the growth of pathogenic microorganisms, and the production of nitric oxide due to activity of the nitrate and nitrite reducing bacteria results in the production of nitrosomyoglobin that accounts for the odor of the meat product. During ripening, proteolytic activity due to enzymes in meat and bacterial starter cultures, and lipolytic enzymes in molds and yeasts lead to products which may contribute to ﬂavor  Hammes and Knauf 1994 .  15 CONCLUSIONS  Fermented foods and drinks play a substantial dietary role in people living in afﬂuent nations as well as the people of developing countries. These foods and drinks are found in supermarkets and in wet markets. The prices of these products vary markedly: some wines may be expensive while some bean products are much cheaper. Man wisely exploited fungi in the production of tasty foods and drinks well before the advent of modern biotechnology. Today some of these fermentation procedures have developed into lucrative enterprises. Some of the fermented products, e.g., red wine, reportedly have health-promoting effects. Many of the fermented products have been found to be aﬂatoxin-free. Nevertheless, a few incidents of poisoning after consumption of fermented food have been reported. It is essential that aﬂatoxin-free raw materials and nontoxic cultures be used for food fermentation.  Recent research on fermented food has focused in several areas including the effect of fermented foods on health. The anka mold, Monascus anka, contains the antioxidant dimerumic acid  Aniya et al. 2000 . The hypocholesterolemic effect of fermented dairy products and their mechanism of action have been reported  St-Onge et al. 2000 . A principal ﬂavor component of soy sauce, 4-hydroxy-2 or 5 -ethyl-5 or 2 -methyl- 2H  furanone is a potent anticarcinogen in mice  Nagahara et al. 1992 . Both beneﬁcial and harmful effects due to kombucha  tea fungus  ingestion in animal experiments and in humans have been described  Greenwalt et al. 2000 .  Another area of recent research is the investigation of the chemical constituents and nutritive values of fermented foods.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   The changes in the major components of kombucha during prolonged fermentation have been followed  Chen and Liu 2000 . The nutritive value of the fermented Nigerian beverage, burukutu and the chemical changes have been examined  Odetokun 1997 . The levels of ethyl carbamate in alcoholic beverages and fermented foods  bread and cheese  have been determined  Dennis et al. 1989 . Microbial analyses have been conducted on fermented food and beverages  Cosentino et al. 2001 . The control of food- borne pathogens during sufu fermentation has been investigated  Shi and Fung 2000 . The stability of stored fermented foods e.g. gari has been studied  Sanni 1996 . this research will help food fermentation Hopefully all become a thriving industry which will introduce more varieties of food and also improve human health.

Rai National Research Centre for Mushroom, Solan, Himachal Pradesh, India  1  INTRODUCTION  sudden The world of mushrooms, owing to their appearance in numbers, groups, rings, bunches, and also in isolation as a single attractive and imposing structure, has fascinated the man since time immemorial and references are available in the scriptures of many ancient civilizations. Theofrastus  372 – 227 BC , the great Greek philosopher, wrote about food value of mushroom when the latter found its way in the royal dishes for Greek and Roman emperors. There are indications that mushroom existed long before the Homo sapiens appeared on Earth, as evident from the fossil records of the lower Cretaceous period, i.e., about 130 million years ago; it is assumed that the primitive man also consumed mushrooms. The collection and consumption of mushrooms from the wild is still a practice in many regions of the world but the scenario changed after successful artiﬁcial cultivation of mushrooms. Though the Chinese are reported to have like Auricularia, cultivated some specialty mushrooms Flammulina and Lentinula between 600 – 1000 AD but, undoubtedly, it was the artiﬁcial cultivation of the common button mushroom  Agaricus bisporus  in France around the year 1650 which transformed the world of mushroom production and consumption.  Not all mushrooms are edible, but some are highly poisonous. While edible ﬂeshy fungi are called mushrooms, poisonous ones are termed ‘toadstools.’ It has been estimated that out of 10,000 species of ﬂeshy fungi  Kendrick 1985  about half of them are edible  Chang 1993  and as many as 100 species are highly poisonous. Collection and consump- tion of wild mushrooms requires knowledge and adequate precaution. Rather it is one of the most important reasons for popularization of artiﬁcial cultivation of proven edible mushrooms.  Commercial production of edible fungi represents unique exploitation of the microbial technology wherein worthless wastes  agricultural, industrial, forestry, and household  are efﬁciently converted into nutritious food. Indoor cultivation of mushrooms utilizing the vertical space is the highest protein producer per unit area and time, almost 100 times more than the conventional agriculture and animal husbandry. It has promising scope to meet the worldwide food shortage, without undue pressure on land, for the human population increasing at an alarming rate of almost 2 lakh people per day. Of about 2000 edible ﬂeshy fungi, 20 types are being artiﬁcially cultivated and about ten are being produced and marketed in sizeable quantities: the common button mush- room  A. bisporus , oyster mushroom  Pleurotus spp. , shiitake  Lentinula edodes , black ear mushroom  Auricularia spp. , paddy straw mushroom  Volvariella volvacea , winter mushroom  Flammulina velutipes , silver ear mushroom  Tremella fuciformis , nameko  Pholiota nameko , monkey head mushroom  Hypsizygus marmoreus  and two famous medicinal mushrooms namely Maitake  Grifola frondosa  and the Reishi  Ganoderma lucidum .  2 WORLD PRODUCTION OF MUSHROOMS  The rapid rate of development of mushroom production technology from a primitive cave culture in France to a high- tech industry during the last three centuries is a success story which has kept pace with the ever-increasing demand for this commodity and there is every reason to be optimistic about its further growth in the years to come  Rai and Verma 1997 . From a meager 2 million tonnes in 1986, the world mushroom production has registered a 3-fold increase in a decade and was about six million tonnes in 1997, and ﬁve mushrooms, namely A. bisporus, Pleurotus spp., V. volvacea, L. edodes  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   and Auricularia spp., the so-called leaders, accounted for 82 per cent of the total mushroom production  Table 1 .  It is clear that the button mushroom  A. bisporus  is still the leader contributing 31.8% to the total mushroom production but its share that was 56.2% in 1986 has decreased over the years. China is the biggest producer of Lentinula, Pleurotus, Auricularia, Volvariella, Flammulina, and Tremella. Indonesia and Thailand are the other major producers of Volvariella. Japan produces signiﬁcant quan- tities of Lentinula and Flammulina and almost the whole quantity of Hypsizygus and Grifola produced in the world. Agaricus production is concentrated in three geographical regions—Europe, North America, and East Asia. In Europe, Netherlands, France, and UK; in America, USA and Canada, and in East Asia, besides the giant China, Indonesia and Taiwan are the other major producers of this mushroom. Asia accounts for major share of US imports. It is quite interesting that six countries called group of six or G-6 countries  USA, Germany, UK, France, Italy, and Canada  account for more than 80% of world consumption; per capita consumption in these countries is very high  2 – 3 Kg . One important indicator of demand for mushroom is the income level of populace in the G-6 nations. Rise in income level is a global phenomenon and the demand for mushrooms is expected to grow at a much faster rate.  3 NUTRITIONAL AND MEDICINAL VALUES  OF MUSHROOMS  It is primarily the ﬂavor and texture for which the mushrooms are devoured by the mankind, and scientiﬁc appreciation of their nutritional and medicinal attributes is a recent phenomenon. Mushrooms have, from nutrition point of view, a distinct place in human diet which otherwise consists of items either of plant or animal origin. Mushrooms are perhaps the only fungi deliberately and knowingly consumed by human beings, and they complement and supplement the human diet with various ingredients not encountered or deﬁcient in food substances of plant and animal origin. Besides the attributes understood in the terms of conventional nutrition, unique chemical composition of mushrooms makes  them suitable for speciﬁc groups suffering with certain physiological disorders or ailments like obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis, hypertension, hyperacidity, constipation, etc  Rai 1995; 1997 .  Nutritional value of mushrooms has been reviewed by many workers  Chang and Miles 1989; Crisan and Sands 1978; Rai 1995 . Only salient features will be brieﬂy but critically described here. It is a fact that there are wide variations in the nutritional values reported for the same species by different workers  Beelman and Edwards 1989; Rai et al. 1988 . However, certain generalizations do emerge. Owing to very high  90%  moisture content these are basically a low calorie food  25 – 35 cal per 100 g fresh weight  and this ﬁts in well in this era of healthy eating by reducing the intake of calories. However, fat content in mushrooms is very low, it is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acid and is cholesterol-free  Rai 1995 . Though carbohydrates constitute the major fraction  50% of dry matter , they are not nutritionally signiﬁcant as the chitin  fungus cellulose , a polymer of N-acetyl glucosamine, is the structural component of cell wall and constitutes the major fractions of the carbohydrates and ﬁber. Chitin-N is also reported to give inﬂated values of the protein content of mushrooms if estimated by quantifying nitrogen and multiplying by the usual factor of 6.25. The ﬁber content is high in all the mushrooms  10% of DW . Mushrooms, due to high quantity and quality of protein have been recognized by the FAO as food contributing to the protein nutrition of the countries depending largely on cereals. Expectedly, in the nutritional evaluation of mushrooms, proteins have been the focus of attention of the researchers, but wide variations in the values for protein content of the mushrooms have been reported  Beelman and Edwards 1989 . Rai et al.  1988  determined in seven Pleurotus species  Table 2  by protein content various methods of protein determination and found that protein values obtained with Folin-Phenol method of Lowry  were closest to N £ 4.38 values as suggested by Crisan and  Sands  1978 . In terms of protein quantity, mushrooms ranking below animal meats rank well above common vegetables and fruits. The quality of mushroom protein is far superior to the vegetable proteins and is as good as or slightly inferior to animal proteins. This is because all the essential  Table 1 World production of cultivated mushrooms  1986  Fresh   £ 1000 T   1997  Fresh   £ 1000 T   Mushroom  A. bisporus L. edodes Pleurotus spp. Auricularia spp. V. volvacea Others Total  Source: Chang  1999 .  1227 341 169 119 178 175 2182   %   56.2 14.4 7.7 5.5 8.2 8.0  3763  1956 1564 876 485 181 1096 6158   %   31.8 25.4 14.2 7.9 3.0  17.70 100.00  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

It is therefore, suggested that mushrooms can supplement the cereal-based diet of the developing countries  Chang and Miles 1989; Rai 1995 . Mushrooms are rich in B complex vitamins and special mention is to be made of the presence of folic acid and B12. Though vitamin C is present, it is vulnerable to postharvest losses due to very high phenol oxidase activity  Rai and Saxena 1989b . Potassium, sodium, phosphorus, and magnesium are the predominant minerals. Iron is present in appreciable quantity in the available form but mushrooms are comparatively deﬁcient in calcium.  Very signiﬁcant pharmacological activities have been observed in some mushrooms; a billion-dollar industry exists for the medicinal mushrooms namely Reishi  Ganoderma lucidum , Maitake  Grifola frondosa , Shiitake  L. edodes , Trametes versicolor, etc. The medicinal mushrooms have been recently reviewed  Rai 1997; Wasser and Weis 1999  and will not be dealt with here.  4 PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY OF EDIBLE  FUNGI  Production of edible fungi or mushrooms involves many steps, mainly the following:  a  Raising and maintenance of  mushroom culture,  c  Substrate preparation,  d  Growing or cropping, and  e  Postharvest handling   b  Seed or spawn preparation,  While step  a  and  b  are more or less common and similar for most of the mushrooms, it is the substrate preparation, crop raising, and post harvest technology which vary with the type of mushroom. In this article after brief treatment of the step  a  and  b , the cultivation technology of the so-called ﬁve leaders mentioned earlier will be brieﬂy described and reviewed. The successive steps of production of mushrooms are depicted in Figure 1.  4.1 Spawn Production  The term “spawn” is used for vegetative growth of mushroom mycelium on a suitable medium, to be used as inoculum or “seed” for the substrate in mushroom cultivation. Right kind and quality of spawn is very important in the cultivation of edible fungi. The technique of spawn preparation witnessed many developments before Sinden developed the currently used “grain spawn” on hard winter rye grain after addition of calcium salts and patented the process in 1932 and 1937. However, wheat grain is now most commonly used as the basal medium for spawn production. Kumar  1995  has described other substrates used for spawn.

If the spawn has not been made from a genetically suitable fruiting culture, or is too old and degenerated, the yield is likely to be poor. Ideal environmental conditions and management cannot compensate for the genetically inferior stock used to make spawn. In most parts of the world, there are specialized spawn manufacturing compa- nies, which not only multiply the spawn but also are engaged in genetic improvement of mushroom germplasm; many high-yielding varieties hybrids of mushrooms with superior quality attributes have been developed by them. The conventional techniques of growing mushroom mycelium on a sterilized substrate, often cereal grains, have been described by many authors  see Kumar 1995  but a revolution is taking place in the containers; it is no more glass bottles, but specially made polybags also called “breathing bags” which can withstand sterilization heat and allow limited gaseous exchange without chances  of microbial contamination have been developed. Some manufacturers have developed liquid spawn also. However, spawn for production of wood-decaying fungi is mostly prepared on wood chips and saw dust – cereal bran mixtures  Chang and Quimio 1982 . Technique of spawn production has been described in detail by various workers  Chang and Miles 1989; Chang and Quimio 1982; Kumar 1995 . Generally, wheat grains soaked in cold water are ﬁrst boiled until these swell and become soft but do not rupture. After draining out excess water and surface drying in shade, calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate are added in such proportions to bring pH of the substrate in the range of 7 – 7.5. The substrate is then ﬁlled in glass bottles polypropylene bags, cotton plugged, and autoclaved at 15 psi for 60 – 90 min. The substrate is inoculated with either pure culture for preparation of “mother spawn” or with mother spawn grains to prepare “planting spawn.”  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   4.2 Maintenance and Preservation of Fungal  Cultures  Pure culture of edible fungi is prepared either by multispore culture or tissue culture; the former is suitable for obtaining fruiting cultures of A. bisporus but is not a suitable technique for heterothallic species. Tissue cultures derived from the stipe or pileus of the mushrooms, both homothallic as well as heterothallic species, can be used to raise fruiting cultures. For multispore culture, a healthy and mature fruitbody of the mushroom is ﬁrst washed in sterile water, surface-sterilized with alcohol, and is placed on a spiral wire loop kept in sterile petriplate covered with a beaker. Mushroom sheds spores on petriplates from which a loopful of spores is transferred on suitable growth medium, generally malt extract agar in case of A. bisporus. Spores after germination give rise to multispore culture. In case of tissue culture, a piece from a suitable place of fruitbody is cut and after surface- sterilization, the piece is transferred onto sterile growth medium slants. Different mushrooms may require different growth medium and incubation temperatures; for example, A. bisporus grows best on malt extract agar medium between 24 – 288C while Volvariella spp. are best maintained on potato dextrose agar medium at 358C. It is desirable that the cultures are not maintained on the same type of medium in each subculturing for a long time. Degeneration of cultures or spawn, which refers to the loss of desired traits, survival, growth rate, and productivity, is not uncommon  Chang and Miles 1989; Stadelmann 1986  and has, of late, attracted the attention of the researchers to understand the reasons. Authentic pure cultures of mushrooms should preferably be obtained from the reputed mushroom germplasm banks. Now a days, mushroom strains of commercial importance are patented and thus free availability is restricted  Jong and Birmingham 1991 .  Though the pure cultures of mushrooms, once raised or obtained as described above, are traditionally maintained by periodic subculturing and or cold storing between 2 – 58C, however, better long-term preservation methods of fungal cultures are advisable and practiced now, which are required for maintenance of vigor and genetic characteristics especially related with productivity and quality  Chang and Miles 1989 . Frequent subculturing is not only time consuming but also costly and risky  Smith and Onions 1983 . Other methods of preserving fungal cultures including mushrooms have been described  Jong 1989; Singh and Upadhyay 2002; Smith and Kolkowski 1996; Smith and Onions 1983 , which include storage in mineral oil  parafﬁn wax , lyophilisation, cryopreservation at low temperatures  2 708C , in liquid nitrogen or in mechanical freezers. The choice of method depends on many factors like requirement, resources, cost, etc. It is advisable that each mushroom strain should be maintained by at least two different methods; liquid nitrogen and mineral oil preservation have been found highly suitable and are popular for preservation of mushroom cultures. Mushroom culture repositories banks play a vital  role in the supply of pure and authentic cultures to the spawn production units. American Type Culture Collection in USA; International Mycological Institute of Microbial Technology and National Research Centre for Mushroom in India are some of the reputed mushroom culture banks.  Institute in UK;  5 BUTTON MUSHROOM  AGARICUS  BISPORUS   Agaricus bisporus  Lange  Sing., popularly known as the white button mushroom, has the widest acceptability and still accounts for more than 30% of total production of all mushrooms. Limited quantities of A. bitorquis, a high temperature species, are also produced in some countries. Its cultivation technology has developed over the years from a primitive cave culture in France in the 16th century to a high- tech industry in America and Europe now. Still in many parts of the world, especially in developing Asian and African countries, sizeable quantities are being produced in low-cost structures like huts under the seasonal conditions. In some parts of the Europe, seasonal growing is done with arrangement for heating during the winters. Like any such venture, the production systems differ in the infrastructure, level of technology, automation, and mechanization but the basic principles and processes remain the same. The production technology of the white button mushroom  A. bisporus  has been described earlier by several authors  van Griensven 1988; Vedder 1978; Vijay and Gupta 1995 . Most important aspect of the button mushroom production is the preparation of the selective growth medium, called compost, in which Agaricus mycelium thrives at the practical exclusion of other competing organisms.  5.1 Substrate  Compost  Preparation  Substrate preparation technique for the button mushroom has witnessed evolutionary changes over the years, from the long- method of composting to the current environment-friendly indoor composting. However, the intermediate short-method of composting, is still the most popular method all over the world.  5.1.1 Long Method of Composting  Long method of composting is the oldest method and now exists only in few pockets of the world mainly because of poor productivity, proneness to attack by the competitors, and also due to more time and labor consuming process  Vijay and Gupta 1995 . This method is completely an outdoor process and takes about 28 days, though production of long-method compost in lesser duration has also been achieved. But the biomass loss in this process is very high  30 – 35%  and the quality as well as productivity is poor, besides the environmental problems it creates.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   5.1.2 Short Method of Composting  Based upon the observations of Lambert that productive compost came from the regions of the pile having temperature between 50 – 608C and adequate supply of oxygen, Sinden and Hauser  1950  developed the so-called short-method of composting mainly because it took lesser time than the long method. The concept and process was indeed a revolution in the cultivation of button mushroom. The short method of composting mainly consists of two phases: outdoor- composting for 10 – 12 days  Phase-I  followed by pasteuri- zation and conditioning for 6 – 7 days inside specialized insulated structures, called tunnels.  Based upon the temperature conditions maintained inside the tunnel, Phase-II can be divided into two sub-phases: pasteurization  57 – 608C for 6 – 8 h  and conditioning  45 – 488C for 5 – 6 days . Importance of conditioning has been linked with the growth of desirable thermophilic microorganisms; pasteurization and conditioning are essential for achieving the selectivity in the compost. Short method of composting has many advantages over the long method: more the ingredients, higher compost per unit weight of productivity of mushrooms, less chances for pests and diseases, shorter duration and less environment pollution.  5.1.3  Indoor Composting  The problems of environmental pollution related with production of stinking gases associated with long as well as short methods of composting drew the attention of the researchers to evolve an alternative “clean” process. Because ﬁrst time the work on such composting system started using completely indoor system, it was termed as indoor composting  Laborde 1992 ; other terms like environmentally-controlled composting, rapid indoor composting, and aerated rapid composting have also been used for this process. Based on the temperature conditions maintained inside the tunnel, the process could be divided into two categories, i.e., INRA method and Anglo-Dutch method. In the INRA method, which is popular in France, Italy, and Belgium, phase-I is carried out at constant temperature of 808C for 2 – 3 days followed by phase-II at 508C for 5 – 7 days  Laborde 1991 . As very high temperature attained during phase-I of this method kills most of the microbes including the desirable thermophiles, reinoculation with mature compost or thermophilic fungi becomes necessary in this process. However, in the bunker system used nowadays this can be dispensed with. In the Anglo-Dutch method, a weeklong conditioning at 418C follows a short pasteurization phase of 4 – 6 h at 608C. The method has attained popularity in several European countries and Australia, and compost with high selectivity and substantial savings on raw materials  Miller 1997  is reported to be produced. Indoor-composting has many advantages even over the short-method of composting: takes lesser time, gives higher yield, is environment-friendly, and conforms to civic laws, lesser loss of raw materials and thus increased  end-product and above all, very high degree of selectivity  Miller 1997 .  5.1.4 Growing or Cropping  Ready compost is seeded with spawn approximately at 0.5% on fresh weight basis after which the seeded substrate is either ﬁlled in polybags or in shelves and the temperature and humidity in the growing rooms are maintained at near 25 – 288C and 90 – 95% RH respectively for 12 – 15 days for mycelial colonization of the substrate called spawn-running. Mushroom mycelium derives nutrition from the substrate by secreting an array of extracellular degradative enzymes capable of degrading cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin-humus complex, and several bacteriolytic and mycolytic enzymes. Once the compost is completely colonized, various types of supplements, often suitably treated proteinaceous materials like soybean meal is thoroughly mixed at 1% in the upper one third area of the substrate which is then layered with 4 – 5 cm of casing material. Depending upon the availability and suitability, various types of materials are used as casing in different regions of the world; peat is of course the substrate of the choice in the developed countries while farmyard manure  FYM  in various combinations with soil and other materials are used in many countries. Recently, choir peat  specially decomposed and processed coir pith dust  has found acceptability as casing material in many Asian countries where coconut plantations abound. Many authors  Hayes 1974; Kurtzman 1997; Vijay and Gupta 1995  have discussed materials, techniques, and the role of casing in cultivation of the button mushroom. Though there are varied observations and opinions on the importance of some properties of casing materials, e.g., pH, conductivity, bulk density, water holding capacity, and associated microﬂora, but that the button mushroom requiring a layering  casing  above the colonized compost for fruiting is a fact well- established. After casing, growing rooms are again main- tained at high temperature  , 258C , humidity  , 90% , and CO2  . 5000 – 10000 ppm  for mycelium to colonize casing layer called case-run. “CaCing”  mixing of small quantity of colonized compost in casing material at the time of casing  and rufﬂing of partially colonized casing material few days before readying for fruiting are some of the improvisations practiced in high-tech mushroom production. After the complete colonization of the casing layer when white mycelium becomes visible between the clumps all over the room temperature is lowered down to casing surface, 16 – 188C, is introduced increased with slight decrease in the humidity  85% RH  i.e., the conditions not conducive for mycelial growth to continue. Under these “adverse” circumstances mycelial aggregation takes place to form pinheads or primordia which differentiate and develop into mushrooms  Figure 2 . After growth to the desired size, mushrooms are handpicked or mechanically harvested. It is common observation that during the commercial cropping of A. bisporus and also of some other mushrooms, there is heavy and synchronous appearance, called “ﬂushes,” of sporophores  fresh air  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   at appropriate intervals with very little fruiting between the ﬂushes called ﬂush break. Fructiﬁcation of mushrooms represents an interesting phenomenon to study the differentiation in multicellular eukaryotes  Rai and Saxena 1991 .  Varied levels of mechanization in composting and cropping and automation especially in the environment control of the growing rooms have been introduced in many developed countries in case of the button mushroom. However, old manual system of seasonal growing in makeshift cropping rooms is still practiced in many developing countries to feed the domestic market.  6 SPECIALTY MUSHROOMS  “Specialty mushrooms” is a term given to a group of cultivated mushrooms which are less common in a particular area or country, but the term has been used to practically encompass all mushrooms other than the common button mushroom  A. bisporus . In the United States, the term “specialty mushrooms” is used to cover all mushrooms other than the button mushroom, which accounted for 90% of total production of 346188 MT there in 1993 – 1994  Sharma 1997 . In Japan, however, the situation is reverse to that in the United States where 90% of total production was of the so-called specialty mushrooms and button mushroom contributed only 10%. Therefore, from the Japanese perspective button mushroom could be termed as specialty mushroom. Be that as it may, the term specialty mushrooms is now well established by usage to represent all mushrooms  other than the button mushroom. Production and consumption of the specialty mushrooms are very popular in the East Asian countries namely China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, and Indonesia and is picking up fast in many American and European countries where these are considered as novelty.  The scope,  importance, and cultivation technology of many specialty mushrooms has been covered brieﬂy by various authors  Royse 1997; Sharma 1997; Stamets 2000  but this review will cover the production technology of the economically most signiﬁcant specialty mushrooms namely, Pleurotus, Lentinus, Volvariella, and Auricularia which together accounted for 75% of the world production of specialty mushrooms in 1997  Table 1 .  6.1 Pleurotus spp.  Oyster Mushrooms   Unlike most of the cultivated mushrooms, which represent one species, a group of species of the genus Pleurotus are commercially cultivated and referred commonly as oyster mushrooms. Pleurotus ostreatus  Jack. ex.Fr.  Kummer, is best known species among oyster mushrooms and the speciﬁc epithet “oyster” obviously refers to its Oyster-shell like appearance of the fruitbodies. Pleurotus spp. are most versatile of all the mushrooms, representing about ﬁfteen species capable of growing over a wide range of temperature  58C to 308C  and on almost all the lignocellulosic wastes; P. sajor- caju, P. ﬂorida, P. ostreatus, and P. ﬂabellatus are most popular commercial species. It is a primary rot fungi and can degrade moistened substrates directly and does not require precomposted substrates like secondary rot fungus, e.g.,  Figure 2 Button mushroom  A. bisporus  cultivation in polybags.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   A. bisporus. Ease with which oyster mushrooms can be grown has manifested itself in the production statistics where the production of oyster mushroom registered 442% increase during the period 1980 – 1991  Chang 1993 .  Production of the oyster mushroom also involves the main steps of mushroom growing described earlier: selection of the substrate and its pretreatment, spawn preparation, spawning, incubation for spawn-run, and providing conditions for fruiting of mushrooms, i.e. cropping. Oyster mushrooms can be grown on a large variety of lignocellulosic wastes depending upon the availability and cost  Poppe 2000  but the cereal straws  wheat and paddy  are the most common substrates in many countries  Figure 3 ; cottonseed hulls are also popular in the United States. Substrate pretreatment is mainly aimed at moistening and so-called pasteurization  sterilization to give advantage to the mushroom mycelium and avoid contamination with moulds specially Trichoderma spp. Most commonly used pretreatments are hot water dip, pasteurization with steam, chemical pasteurization and steam sterilization  Jandaik 1997 . Zadrazil and Dube  1992  have described a method for special substrate preparation for oyster mushroom. Pretreated substrate is mixed with grain spawn at 2 per cent by wet weight of the substrate and then ﬁlled in suitable containers, most commonly polybags. Bottle cultivation of the oyster mushroom is done in Japan. In some countries delayed-release nutrients, mostly formal- dehyde-treated or polymer-coated soybean meal, is added in the substrate to increase the yield but the method involves risk of rise in bed temperature and contamination with moulds. Growth parameters for cultivation of Pleurotus differ from species to species, especially temperature requirement and  general parameters and have been described by Jandaik  1997 . There are wide variations among the growers about the method and style of opening of the containers for fruiting: complete removal of polycover, only top open like Japanese method of bottle cultivation, and slashes or holes in polycover. Average commercial yields obtained are 1 ton fresh weight of mushrooms per ton of dry weight of the substrate. One peculiar and serious problem with the cultivation of the oyster mushroom is spore allergy, which sometimes develops among workers for which facemasks are generally used during the operations.  6.2 Lentinula edodes  Shiitake   Shiitake is the second most important commercial mushroom; it contributed 25.4% of total mushroom production in 1997  Table 1 . Of late, production of this mushroom has become very popular due to not only its unique taste and ﬂavor but also its unique medicinal properties, such as antitumor, hyocholesterolemic, and antiviral properties; Lentinan, a polysaccharide, is now an established immunomodulator  Mizuno 1995 ; Though Japan is the leading producer of shiitake its cultivation ﬁrst started in China near 1100 AD, and the technology was perhaps passed on to Japanese growers by the Chinese.  Cultivation technology of the L. edodes has been described in detail by various authors  Harris 1986; Royse 2001 . Traditionally shiitake has been grown on natural logs of various species of trees but currently oak  Quercus  logs are most popular. The type, size, and quality of logs used have  Figure 3 Pleurotus ﬂorida on wheat straw blocks.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   been described by Royse  2001 . Generally, logs of 7 – 15 cm dia are cut into 1 m lengths. Holes are then drilled; one row of holes is drilled for each 2.5 cm of log diameter and are evenly spaced length-wise every 15 cm along the row. Holes are plugged with wood piece spawn or sawdust spawn, and then ﬁnally sealed with hot wax; plug spawn is however preferred for varied reasons. Spawn run may take 6 – 18 months which depends upon many factors. Logs, after the spawn-run, are transferred to a growing yard, which should be cooler and humid than the spawn-run area. One interesting treatment given to induce fruiting in logs is “shocking treatment” where logs are banged with a hammer or dropped on end  Chang and Miles 1989 . Production is very good during the spring and fall. Some growers, however, use green houses for winter production when the prices are considerably higher. In the green house cultivation technology, logs are generally soaked in water and vibrated mechanically prior to keeping in the houses. After taking the ﬁrst ﬂush, logs are reincubated for about 3 months and the process is repeated up to ﬁve times. Yields obtained from log system may be as high as 33%; best production occurs in second and third years. Shiitake production drops and is no longer possible after the bark is lost.  To make the shiitake cultivation more environment- friendly, synthetic log production system was developed where sawdust is the main ingredient; however, straw and corncobs are also used. Basal ingredients are supplemented with some starchy substance like cereal brans, maize, and some chemicals like calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate   gypsum , and sugar. Ingredients are mixed in a mixer and moistened to a level of 60%. Moistened substrate is generally ﬁlled in polypropylene bags  2.5 Kg . Little holes are either made in the polybags or special breather patch made of micro- porous plastic is preprovided. The bags are then sterilized for 2 h at 1218C in large autoclaves and, after cooling, seeded with spawn. The bags after heat sealing are shaken to evenly distribute the spawn; sawdust spawn or cereal grain spawn is used in this system. Spawn-run at 218C with 4 h of light per day takes 18 – 23 days for optimum growth. Colonized blocks are taken out by slicing and peeling off the polycover and kept for 4 weeks in the environment conducive for browning of the temperature of about 198C and exterior surface i.e., at 2000 – 3000 ppm CO2 and are watered once daily; and humidiﬁcation may also be resorted to. As the browning to form about process nears completion, pinheads start 1 – 2 mm beneath the surface. Primordia development is stimulated by soaking the blocks in cool water  128C  for 3 – 4 h; soaking is required for second and third ﬂushes also. Mushrooms are ready for harvesting approximately after 7 – 11 days of soaking  Figure 4 . Shiitake are harvested by gentle twisting by hand and stem cut with sharp knife like that for button mushroom. After harvesting, blocks are soaked again for 12 h, which may be 18 h in third soaking; ﬂush breaks in shiitake are 16 – 20 days long. The total production cycle on synthetic logs is just 3 – 4 months and biological efﬁciency achieved is also very high  75 – 125%  as against cycle of 5 – 6 years and B.E. of 33% in natural log cultivation  Royse 2001 .

All Rights Reserved.   6.3 Volvariella spp.  Paddy Straw Mushroom   Volvariella is a mushroom of the tropics and subtropics; it grows at a relatively high temperature of around 358C. This is a very fast growing mushroom, it takes about 10 days from spawning to ﬁrst harvesting, is easiest to cultivate with a cropping cycle of 3 weeks but does not give good economic yields and its shelf-life is poorest of all mushrooms. Understandably, its production in 1997 was only 0.18 million tonnes and it contributed only 3% to the world mushroom production while its share was 4.6% in 1986. Nevertheless, its signiﬁcance lies in East Asian countries where staple food is rice and paddy straw can be utilized for growing this mushroom mostly for self-consumption or trade in the domestic market. Commonly cultivated species are V. volvacea and V. bombycina.  There are two commercial substrates for growing this mushroom: traditional paddy straw bundles made into beds and the other involves the use of cotton waste compost after a short period of fermentation. The latter has many advantages  Quimio 1993; Quimio et al. 1990 . While outdoor seasonal farming is still done on paddy straw by small growers, modern indoor cultivation is done on fermented cotton waste. Grain  wheat, sorghum  or cereal straw spawn is used; however,  cotton waste þ tea leaves spawn has been found superior   Chang 1982 . Several techniques have been used for the cultivation of V. volvacea in the tropics, which thrives in the temperature range of 30 – 358C and R.H. of 75 – 85%  Quimio et al. 1990 . However, the traditional method of cultivation in South-East Asia is on straw beds, both outdoor and indoor,  while the more sophisticated indoor technique is preferred for industrial scale production on cotton waste compost; the latter gives higher yield but is capital-intensive process. While the traditional paddy straw cultivation has been described in detail by several authors  Chang 1982; Khanna 1997; Quimio et al. 1990 , modern indoor cultivation technology under controlled conditions on cotton waste compost will be dealt here  Chang 1982; Quimio 1993 . Since 1973, straw mushroom has been cultivated completely on cotton waste compost in controlled conditions in Hong Kong and the technology is now being practiced in Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Singapore, and some parts of Malaysia and Philippines. It takes about 4 days to make compost of cotton waste mixed with rice bran and water. Compost is ﬁlled  10 cm  on beds in a plastic mushroom house ﬁtted with blower and polyduct and pasteurized with live steam for 2 h at 60 – 628C, conditioned at 50 – 528C for 8 h and then allowed to cool to 34 – 368C suitable for spawning. The amount of spawn used is 1.4% of the dry weight of compost or 0.4% of wet weight. Full growth is achieved within 3 – 4 days at 32 – 348C of room temperature. During spawn-running no water and light is needed and a little ventilation is provided. Then white light is provided with ﬂuorescent lamps and fresh air is introduced. After removal of plastic sheets and sprinkling with water, growth of other fungi and actinomycetes retards while V. volvacea continues to grow. On the ﬁfth day after spawning primordia appear, which take about 4 days to reach the harvesting stage. Straw mushrooms are not allowed to grow to umbrella like structures but are picked for marketing at the stage before volva enclosing the cap breaks or just after  Figure 5 Proper stage for harvesting of V. volvacea.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   rupture; the former is “button stage” and the latter is “egg stage”  Figure 5 . The ﬁrst ﬂush usually lasts for 4 – 5 days; four days later second ﬂush starts but yield is just 10% of the ﬁrst ﬂush. For all purposes, only one ﬂush is commercially taken and in this way, one mushroom house can give two crops a month or at least three corps every two months. The shelf life of Volvariella is very short; it liqueﬁes even at 48C and also at high temperature. While canning is done at the industrial scale it is generally traded fresh or dried by small farmers in the developing countries.  6.4 Auricularia spp.  Wood Ear Mushroom   The species of Auricularia, commonly known as wood ear mushroom, are morphologically and, above all, texturally quite distinct from other mushrooms. With typical ear like morphology with cartilaginous texture and gelatinous surface, these are liked as well as disliked at the same time by different people. This mushroom is very popular in China and Southeast Asia but does not seem to attract western consumers. It has been reported to possess many medicinal attributes: treatment of piles, sore throat, anemia and hypocholesterolemic effect  Quimio et al. 1990; Royse 1997 . Out of about 10 recognized species of Auricularia two main commercially cultivated species are A. auricula and A. polytricha, the former is thin and light coloured while the latter is the thicker, longer, hairy, and darker. A. fuscosuccinea is also produced on a limited scale. Thailand and Taiwan are the main producers of this mushroom.  Like shiitake  L. edodes , Auricularia are also produced on natural logs as well as on synthetic logs  sawdust medium , the latter is more popular, productive and proﬁtable system. The cultivation of Auricularia on natural logs is popular in the areas where suitable trees are abundant. This mushroom, unlike Lentinula, is not fastidious about the type of tree species and almost any tree except pines can be used. A log diameter of 3-6 cm and length of 1 m is recommended. The time of season for log felling is similar to that for Lentinula log cultivation i.e., when leaves are just starting to dry in autumn then logs have sufﬁcient sugar and moisture to support mycelial growth. Holes are made, spawned, and sealed like that for Lentinula and incubated  20 – 288C  outdoors in the “laying yard” during which logs are turned upside down once a month. After about 2 months, logs are transferred to the cropping area which may be an open area in a forest or a green house or shed where logs are kept upright and frequently watered; ideal temperature for cropping is 15 – 258C which of course depends upon the strain used. Mushrooms can be harvested about 30 days after exposure to cropping conditions. During the winters, production ceases but logs are kept protected for getting fruiting next spring by resuming heavy watering. The logs should continue to produce mushrooms year after year unless they become heavily contaminated with some wood decaying fungi.  In the synthetic log cultivation, the substrate consists of sawdust, cottonseed hulls, bran, and other cereal grains.  The substrate may be composted for up to 5 days or used directly after mixing. Compost is prepared by mixing and watering the ingredients  sawdust 78%, bran 20%; CaCO3, 1%, sucrose 1%  in a large pile, which is turned twice at 2 days interval. Directly used substrate mainly has 93% cotton seed hulls, 5% wheat bran, and 1% each of sucrose and CaCO3 which is moistened to a level of 60% and then ﬁlled into polypropylene bags and sterilized at 1218C for 60 min. Spawning is done in cooled substrate either with grain or sawdust spawn, manually or mechanically. Bags are incubated at 25 ^ 28C for 28 – 30 days for spawn-run preferably in dark area  , 500 lux . Temperature is then lowered to 20 ^ 28C and light intensity increased to 2000 lux to promote pinning for which 5 – 8 holes of 2.5 cm are cut in the bags for emergence and maturation of mushrooms. Biological efﬁciency of 100% and above has been achieved. In India this mushroom has been successfully cultivated on wheat straw supplemented with wheat bran  Figure 6  and B. E. of as high as 140% has been recorded  Bhandal and Mehta 1989 .  Figure 6 Auricularia polytricha on wheat straw blocks  mark the slits .  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

Weight loss, blackening, veil- opening, and microbial spoilage are the common undesirable postharvest changes besides many physiological and bio- chemical changes  Bano et al. 1997; Rai and Saxena 1989a; Saxena and Rai 1989 . Mushrooms require utmost postharvest care like proper handling, packaging, precooling, cool-chain transport, and storage till consumed. Modiﬁed atmosphere packaging  MAP , controlled atmosphere packaging  CAP , and modiﬁed humidity packaging  MHP  of the button mushroom have been described by Anantheshwaran and Ghosh  1997 . Individual Quick Frozen  IQF  mushrooms are gaining popularity with other frozen vegetables in the super markets.  Postharvest technology of mushrooms has been dealt in detail by many authors  Bano et al. 1997; Lal Kaushal and Sharma 1995; Saxena and Rai 1989 . Mushrooms are delicate, contain 90% water, rich in phenolics and have very active phenol oxidase and protease activities. They lack protective covering of suberin or cuticle, unlike fresh fruits and vegetables. Postharvest physiological and biochemical changes do take place at very fast rate. Storage in package ﬁlms, sodium alginate coating, chemical preservation, lactic acid fermentation, irradiation, steeping preservations have been attempted to varied levels of success for short-term preservation of mushrooms. But dehydration and canning are the most common forms of long-term storage and trade in mushrooms; while canning is the most common method for the button mushroom, drying is resorted to for storage and trade of all the specialty mushrooms. Button mushrooms are also freeze-dried in limited quantities. However, in solar dehydration, cabinet tray drying, and tunnel drying technologies of mushrooms are needed to produce better product. Of late, many attempts have been made to produce value-added mushroom products like pickles, soup powder, ready-to-use mushroom curry, nuggets, biscuits, etc.; in future we may witness more of such products.  improvements  There are very few wastes of lignocellulosic nature of agro- forestry origin, which can not be used for growing one or the other mushroom. Poppe  2000  has compiled the information on various agro-wastes, which have been used for growing mushrooms. Residues left after obtaining the main product  e.g., grains, cotton, sugar  pose problems of their disposal and many may prove to be environmental hazards. Cultivation of various edible fungi on these wastes represents one of the unique recycling mechanisms where hardly any residue is left unexploited in one form or the other. The substrate left after growing the mushrooms is though often called “spent mushroom substrate”  SMS , which is a misnomer and “post-mushroom substrate”  PMS  is a more appropriate term because it is not “spent” and can be further decomposed by new set of organisms. Many efforts have been made towards proﬁtable utilization of the PMS. The subject has recently been reviewed  Ahlawat and Rai 2002; Levanon and Danai 1997a . PMS of one mushroom can be utilized for growing other mushroom after suitable treatments. The PMS of the oyster mushroom is fed to cattle as feed and the dung obtained is used for biogas production; slurry of biogas plant is used as casing material for the button mushroom and PMS of button mushroom including casing fraction is decomposed in composting pits to be used as manure for raising the crop which was used to grow the primary mushroom, in this case the oyster mushroom  Table 4 . In Israel, the above system of complete recycling of wastes has been successfully developed and adopted by the growers  Levanon and Danai 1997b . PMS, especially of the button mushroom, after suitable treatment like recomposting, has proved very good manure for raising not only the horticultural crops but also the major crops; it can also be used for biogas production. As mentioned earlier, the PMS of the oyster mushroom is a very good cattle feed with improved protein content and digestibility. Post- mushroom substrates have also been used for reclamation of soil and bioremediation of soil and water  Ahlawat and Rai 2002 . Cultivation of edible fungi has the above mentioned economic it represents the production of food  mushroom  feed, fuel  environmental  advantages;  as well  as  Table 4 Recycling mushroom substrates and wastes  Recycling course  Main product  Waste byproduct  Cultivation of cotton wheat Cultivation of oyster mushroom on straw SMS as cattle feed Manure for biogas production Cabutz as casing soil for button mushroom SMS composted for organic farming  Source: Levanon and Danai  1997a .

It promises to supply food with good quality protein produced from worthless lignocellulosic wastes of varied origins. In future, newer mushrooms are likely to be added to diversify the portfolio of the cultivated mushrooms and the production of the presently consumed mushrooms will increase with the genetic improvement of the strains and the advancements in the cultivation technology. Modern biotechnological tools and computer aided environmental control will break the yield barriers. Share of the specialty mushrooms including the medicinal mushrooms will rise further and mushroom cultivation is likely to spread all over the world. Newer methods of culture preservation, spawn and substrate preparation for the mushrooms are being worked upon. Modern developments in packaging, storage, transport, and processing including the value-addition of food items will be extended to mushrooms, which will further boost its consumption and production. Researches on the utilization of post-mushroom substrate have thrown light on immense usefulness of this venture for production of food, feed, fuel, and fertilizer from the wastes through mushroom cultivation.

Practically, every civilization has developed fermentation processes of one sort or another as the basis of their culinary traditions. However, the culture of microorganisms as a source of nourishment, rather than as food transformers, came with the advent of industrial fermentation technology. The ﬁrst recognition of the value of surplus brewer’s yeast as a feeding supplement for animals by Max Delbru¨ck  1910  was rapidly followed by the production of yeast for food during the ensuing First World War. The novel microbial foods may not have appealed to the conservative human palate, but this drawback was vastly outweighed by the logistic advantage of a high productivity of aerobic fermentations in relatively compact installations. This overriding feature motivated military strategists to draw plans to produce large amounts of yeast and fungal biomass during, as well as between, the two World War periods. The cessation of open worldwide hostilities in the second half of the 20th century could have meant an end to interest in microbial protein production for food. However, new preoccupations regarding malnutrition in third world countries, or political and economic isolation, as in the case of the Soviet Union and China, maintained the scope of microbial fermentations as a practical solution for the production of food, at least in emergency situations.  Spectacular developments in the ﬁeld of agriculture, later accompanied by important changes in international relations leading to the opening of the world food markets, overshadowed the worries of limited food supplies. This  rapid development rendered mass microbial food production uncompetitive against traditional agricultural food crops, which became readily available at comparatively lower prices. This fact also led to a progressive decline in Single Cell Protein research studies in the literature  Ugalde and Castrillo 2002 .  Notwithstanding this decline, biomass production tech- nologies evolved away from microbial protein as bulk food, towards new specialities, leading to a new revitalization in the ﬁeld  Figure 1 . Examples of this are a wide range of food ﬂavors and aromas produced by Burns Philp Food and Fermentation group  http:  www.bpfoods.com , and yeast products directed to human and animal consumption by Lallemand Inc  http:  www.lallemand.com . Most notable example of the evolution of microbial biomass into new products is perhaps that led by Rank Hovis McDougall  RHM  in cooperation with Imperial Chemical Industries  ICI , founding Marlow Foods  now part of the AstraZeneca group , a company which started producing mycoprotein and related products under trademark Quorne  http:  www.quorn.com . This company produces fungal biomass from Fusarium venenatum  formerly F. graminearum  in continuous culture and the resulting product is manipulated to achieve a texture and taste which are reminiscent of meat products, covering a market as a meat alternative for vegetarian formulations. The mycoprotein production process experienced an evolution of 20 years and an estimated Research and Development expenditure of $40 million, before unrestricted clearance by the UK Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Foods was granted in 1985.

The Quorn mycoprotein process is the main microbial protein production project directed to human consumption to date. Thus the Quorn project will be alluded in this review as the general example. Other projects will be speciﬁcally referred to.  2.1 Mycoprotein as Food  The microbial food product of the early 21st century does not base its market success solely on account of its protein content, as vegetable proteins sources are abundant in the market at competitive prices. The resemblance in texture to that of currently appreciated foods, and a bland taste and light color, which renders it susceptible to the addition of ﬂavoring and coloring agents, are also a prerequisite. The ﬁlamentous nature of the organism, a feature, which was considered as a technical difﬁculty for production at ﬁrst, was foreseen as an advantage in the case of Quorn, rendering the ﬁnal product a resemblance to animal or ﬁsh meat. Rarer features, but by no means less important ones, such as those favoring health in normal humans, or indeed rendering beneﬁcial effects in patients with high blood cholesterol levels or diabetes are certainly important, as will be discussed below.  Figure 1 Number of food patents including “mycoprotein” or “yeast” in their title or abstract.

In this review, we intend to highlight important developments that have taken place in the production and use of mycoprotein, deﬁned here as “microbial protein produced from microscopic fungi,” with mention of other specialities. The study includes relevant examples already present in the market and others, which have only been registered as patents. We will also conduct an exercise in determining what future lay ahead for mycoprotein and related products.  2 MYCOPROTEIN AS FOOD FOR HUMAN  CONSUMPTION  2.1.1 Composition  Although a number of species has been reported to present favorable characteristics for the production of microbial  Although fungal biomass can be considered principally as a source of protein, it also contains nucleic acids, carbohydrate cell wall material, lipids, minerals, and vitamins. These contributions are generally considered of little relevance, with  Table 1 Yeasts and ﬁlamentous fungi species accepted for production of protein compounds and food ingredients for the food industry  Yeasts  Filamentous fungi  S. cerevisiae  baker’s yeast  S. cerevisiae  brewer’s yeast  C. utilis  Torula yeast  K. marxianus  formerly K. fragilis, S. fragilis  K. marxianus var. lactis  K. lactis, formerly S. lactis  C. pseudotropicalis P. pastoris P. rhodozyma F. venenatum  formerly F. graminearum   Quorn products  P. variotii  Pekilo process, discontinued  A. niger; A. oryzae R. niveus; R. oryzae Mucor spp. Streptomyces spp. P. roquefortii  Data obtained from Hala´sz and La´sztity  1991 , Peppler  1983  and Centre for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition  CFSAN  and US Food and Drug Administration  FDA   http:  www.cfsan.fda.gov .

Approximately 80% of total fungal nitrogen is composed of essential amino acids required for human growth and nutrition  Table 2 . With reference to egg albumin, which is considered a perfectly balanced source of essential amino acids for human nutrition, mycoprotein presents a similar composition, although it is lower in sulfur containing amino acids. On the other hand, it is relatively rich in lysine and threonine if compared to other traditional protein sources of agricultural origin, such as wheat. A comparison with a wide range of protein sources is provided in Table 3.  2.1.2 Protein Value  The amino acid composition is only a theoretical indicator of the protein value of foods, since the degree of digestion and absorption of any one substance is determined by its susceptibility to be degraded and absorbed. The presence of inhibitors and multiple other factors in foods also modify their nutritional value. On the other hand, the digestive system of the organism in question is a key determinant in the  ð1Þ  ð2Þ  digestibility of various protein sources. Thus, empirical tests are usually required for feed evaluation, and the parameters used are: the total quantity of microbial nitrogen ingested  I , the nitrogen of faeces  F , and nitrogen in urine  U . From these parameters, Digestibility, Biological Value  BV , and Protein efﬁciency  PE  can be calculated. Thus, Digestibility  D  is the percentage of the total nitrogen consumed, which is absorbed from the digestive tract.  D ¼ 100 £ ðI 2 FÞ=I  Biological Value  BV  is the percentage of the total nitrogen assimilated, which is retained by the organism, taking into account the simultaneous loss of endogenous nitrogen through excretion in urine.  BV ¼ 100 £ ðI 2 ½F þ U cid:1 Þ=ðI 2 FÞ  Protein Efﬁciency  PE  is the proportion of nitrogen retained when the protein under test is fed and compared with that retained when a reference protein, such as egg albumin, is fed. Protein from yeast biomass such as Candida utilis has presented high digestibility values  81% , and BVs between 32 and 48%. Both parameters can be substantially increased when supplementation with 0.5% methionine is implemented  w w, 90% in both cases . The BV of yeast has been estimated to be of 0.9, and methionine supplementation increases it to a value of 2.3  Rivie`re 1977 .  Quorn mycoprotein presents very high PE values, reaching 75% with respect to egg albumin. In experimental tests where mycoprotein was supplemented with 0.2% methionine, this value rose to 100%. Quorn products are not supplemented with methionine, but egg protein as explained below. Thus, mycoprotein could be used as a total replacement for the human diet  Trinci 1992, 1994; US Patent 5935841 1999; WO Patent 9117669 1991 .  Toxicity testing of Quorn mycoprotein has shown that the product can be consumed as the sole source of protein on a continued basis, without any adverse effects. Given the unconventional nature of this product, the tests undertaken for  Table 3 Essential amino acid content  g per 100 g edible portion  of mycoprotein  Quorn , baker’s yeast, egg  whole raw fresh , beef  ground, regular baked-medium , soybeans  mature seeds, raw  and wheat  Durum   Amino acids  Myco protein  Baker’s yeast  Soybeans  Wheat  Histidine Isoleucine Leucine Lysine Methionine Phenylalanine Tryptophan Threonine Valine  0.39 0.57 0.95 0.91 0.23 0.54 0.18 0.61 0.60  0.22 0.48 0.67 0.69 0.17 0.41 0.11 0.44 0.51  Egg  0.30 0.68 1.10 0.90 0.39 0.66 0.15 0.60 0.76  Beef  0.78 1.02 1.80 1.89 0.58 0.89 0.26 0.99 1.11  0.98 1.77 2.97 2.43 0.49 1.90 0.53 1.58 1.82  0.32 0.53 0.93 0.30 0.22 0.68 0.18 0.37 0.59  Data from US Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service.

The mycoprotein product is approved for consumption in the European Union. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is currently in the process of publishing an ofﬁcial response to the Full Food Additive Petition submitted by the manu- facturers. This response will be made public in 2002  FDA, http:  www.fda.gov, GRAS Notice No. GRN 000091 . Products containing mycoprotein have been on sale in the United States since January 2002.  2.1.3 Nucleic Acid Content  Nucleic acids are a necessary component of all cells, and are found in relatively high levels in rapidly dividing cells. Thus, the nucleic acid content of yeast  around 10% of dry weight  is approximately ﬁve times greater than in the average mammalian organ. When nucleic acids are ingested, they are ﬁrst attacked in the duodenum by pancreatic nuclease. The resulting nucleotides are then attacked by nucleotidases in the intestine, resulting in nucleosides and phosphate. These in turn are further degraded to purine and pyrimidine bases. The degradation of purine bases in man results in the production of uric acid. Accumulation of uric acid beyond the excretion capacity of the kidney results in the formation of crystalline deposits in the joints and soft tissues, leading to goutlike manifestations and calculi in the urinary tract. Pyrimidines are degraded to orotic acid, the accumulation of which results in liver damage. The administration of foods of microbial origin is limited by the amount of nucleic acid contained within. The administration of 130 g of yeast daily for one week results in uric acid levels ranging between 4.8 and 8.3 mg 100 ml in human volunteers. Normal plasma levels of uric acid range between 2 and 7 mg 100 ml in males  Rivie`re 1977 .  Quorn mycoprotein is obtained from a ﬁlamentous fungus which proliferates at slower rate than yeast  Trinci 1994; Ugalde and Castrillo 2002 . Thus, the starting nucleic acid content subject to removal is also slightly lower  8 – 9% . The RNA content reduction of mycoprotein is further effected by a heat shock treatment that will be described below [see section “Mycoprotein production  Quorn products” ]. RNA levels are thus reduced well below the levels which limit consumption to 100 g per day per person  2% of dry weight , although this treatment also results in important losses in dry weight  Trinci 1992 .  2.1.4 Texture  Another favorable feature which differentiates Quorn products is the advantage taken from the ﬁlamentous nature of the microorganism in product design. Fusarium venenatum A3 5 ﬁlaments are aligned in parallel by a specially designed mechanical process which renders the product a texture very similar to that of meat ﬁbers once set in a light matrix of egg white protein and heated. The ﬁnal product has a bland taste, light color which renders it susceptible to the addition of ﬂavoring and coloring agents  Anderson et al. 1975 .  2.1.5 Additional Functionalities  incorporating realistic amounts of  In addition to the nutritional effects, consumption of mycoprotein under both controlled and free-living studies has been shown to beneﬁcially reduce total and low density lipoprotein  LDL  serum cholesterol levels. Studies by Homma et al.  1995 , Turnbull et al.  1992 , Udall et al.  1984  the product concluded that mycoprotein consumption has a beneﬁcial effect in serum lipid variables. Post-meal glycemia has been shown to be reduced after consumption of mycoprotein, by 13% with respect to controls. On the other hand, insulinemia is reduced by 19% thirty minutes after ingestion  Turnbull and Ward 1995 . Finally, a mycoprotein lunch has a signiﬁcant effect on the sensation of satiety, in ways that would help control the appetite of dieting patients, as proposed by Burley et al.  1993 , Turnbull et al.  1993 .  2.2 Mycoprotein Production  Quorn Products   In order to ensure that Quorn is produced according to approved health regulations, the fermentation process is currently supported on glucose  nearly all of which is obtained from maize  and approved inorganic medium constituents and vitamins. However, the process may also be applied with various sources of starch as the carbon source  Figure 2 Diagramatic representation of the Quorne air-lift fermenter used by Marlow Foods for the production of mycoprotein in continuous ﬂow culture,  Courtesy: P. Colllins, Marlow Foods, UK .  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.    Anderson et al. 1975; Steinkraus 1986 . The production of Fusarium venenatum strain A3 5 takes place in turbidostat culture using air-lift fermenters of 155 m3 in volume and 50 m tall, weighing over 250 tons each. The Quorn fermenters are the largest operating air-lift fermentation facility in the world to date  Marlow Foods communication 2002 .  Each fermenter operates as a loop where culture medium is circulating  Figure 2 . As the liquid ﬂows through the bottom of the loop, air is pumped in. Circulation is induced by a rising column of air bubbles providing good oxygen transfer conditions. This circulation is maintained due to mean density difference between riser and downcomer. The bottom of the downcomer hosts the glucose, biotin, and mineral salts intake. The nitrogen supply is delivered separately in the form of ammonia along with sterile air at the base of the riser. The supply of ammonia to the culture is regulated by a pH monitor set to give a culture pH of approximately 6.0. The dilution rate 21 and is of the process ranges between 0.17 and 0.2 h operated so that glucose is always in excess and the fungus always grows at mmax at a biomass concentration of 10 to 21  Trinci 1994 . The culture is kept at a temperature of 15 g L approximately 308C by a heat exchanger set into the riser.  The dilution rate of the fermenter results in an output of 30 tons of liquid per hour. Harvesting by ﬁltration and RNA reduction ensues. The harvested biomass  Figure 3  contain- ing 8-9%  w w  RNA is heated to 688C for 25 min at a pH of 5 – 6. This results in the reduction of RNA to ca. 1%  w w , at the expense of losing up to one third of the total mass, including dissolved salts, RNA, internal water, carbohydrates, and protein.  Studies on the incidence of the production phase duration on product cost and commercial viability had indicated that periods above 200 h operation can be necessary to result in consistent unit costs of production  Trilli 1977 .  In principle, a continuous culture may run indeﬁnitely, as long as contamination is kept under check. However, cultivation beyond 100 generations  about 400 h  of F. venenatum may result in the appearance of highly branched colonial mutants which can alter the texture of the ﬁnal product  Wiebe and Trinci 1991; Wiebe et al. 1992; Wiebe et al. 1995 .  The details behind the appearance of mutations in continuous culture, with speciﬁc reference to F. venenatum strain A3 5 have been studied by external research independent to the production process  Trinci 1992; Trinci 1994 . From these studies, the authors obtained the conclusion that spontaneous mutant appearance may be managed by careful manipulation of the selective pressure imposed through culture conditions. The above-described strategies however have been successfully tested in laboratory conditions. These strategies do not conform to the industrial production process and are not necessarily used commercially  Marlow Foods communication 2002 .  2.3 Related Products  Although there is a high variety of microbial protein formulations which can be used as food ingredients, apart from the major Quorn mycoprotein example a number of  Figure 3 Electron micrograph of F. venenatum A3 5 as collected from the outlet of the Quorne fermenter, illustrating the ﬁlamentous nature of mycoprotein,  Courtesy: P.

Since the techniques for production of yeast are well established  Peppler and Stone 1976; Ward 1992 , most of the new developments deal with post- production treatments of the biomass  Hala´sz and La´sztity 1991 . This aspect will be covered in detail in this chapter, therefore.  3.1 Active Formulations  The major microbial products used as feed additives are the two yeast categories approved to maintain their fermentative capacity, “active dry yeast”  96.2  and “yeast culture”  96.8   Peppler 1983; Ofﬁcial Publication of Association of American Feed Control Ofﬁcials 2002 . Active dry yeasts  are used as starters in the baking industry and in other traditional fermentation industries where the leavening activity, and ability to ferment different raw materials, is necessary to improve storability, taste and ﬂavor. At this moment, companies such as Beldem  http:  www.beldem. com , subsidiary of the Puratos group, manufactures active dry yeast for use in bakery and Lesaffre group  http:  www. lesaffre.com  and Lallemand Inc  http:  www.lallemand.com  commercialize a wide range of sourdough starters and yeast products for the baking, brewing and wine industry.  Yeast culture is the only ofﬁcially deﬁned feed yeast ingredient which is not composed of isolated dried yeast cells only. Yeast culture consists mainly of growth medium with a moderate content in crude protein. It is being used as an aid to the ensiling process  lactic acid formation by naturally present bacteria , which increases feed value and improves the quality and palatability of the resulting silage, but the greater portion is used to fortify feeds and feed concentrates administered to livestock and poultry  Peppler and Stone w 1976; Peppler 1983 . As an example, Diamond V produces active yeast cultures for fermenting liquid and cereal grain raw ingredients for animal feeds including dairy, beef, horse, poultry, aquaculture, and pet foods.  Yeast and fungi active cultures are also approved for production of commercial enzymes for the food industry. The FDA accepts the use of, among others: amyloglucosidase derived from Rhizopus niveus; carbohydrase from R. oryzae; lactase enzyme preparation from K. lactis and chymosin lactis or A. niger. New generally preparation from K. recognized as a safe  GRAS  fungi and yeasts are continuously under study with the objective of incorporation of new fungal enzymes into the food industry  Saxena et al. 2001; Wolf 1996 .  3.2  Inactive Formulations  Inactivated biomass from yeasts and fungi can be processed into a variety of different valuable products serving as ingredients for animal and human consumption. Due to their nucleic acid content and cell wall compounds which may cause undesirable effects, the main strategies entail cell lysis and extraction of the components, mainly proteins, and separation and concentration for the production of concen- trates and isolates. These can be used directly  e.g., Beldem produces inactive yeast for use in animal feed  or processed in order to get extracts, autolysates, and protein hydrolysates of speciﬁc functional properties.  Use of yeast protein concentrates and isolates in food processing is recommended in many scientiﬁc papers due to their favorable nutritional properties. However, due to the relative high cost of protein isolate production the use of these formulations is limited to meat products, meat, and milk substitutes.  Yeast and fungi autolysates and hydrolysates are obtained by hydrolysis of the proteic fraction. These can be used as natural ﬂavors under the deﬁnition of the FDA and Code of  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   Federal Regulations  21 CFR 101.22 3   and to improve the physical properties  texture, emulsifying properties  and nutritional value of food products  Hala´sz and La´sztity 1991 . Thus, yeast autolysates and hydrolysates are used as ﬂavor enhancers in sausage, meat, and cheese manufacture  Hala´sz and La´sztity 1991 . Examples of these applications are: the production of Aspergillus oryzae extracts by Diamond V, the autolyzed yeast ﬂavor used as a livestock feed, w ingredients, Provesta yeast extracts manufactured by Burns Philp  http:  www. bpfoods.com  for use in different food systems, sauces, soups, marinades, and many other food types. Lallemand Inc, Lesaffre group, and Beldem also produce a complete range of yeast extracts for animal feed and as ﬂavor enhancers for application in animal and human nutrition. At this moment, the studies are mainly focused on new developments and more tailored protein formulations whose acceptance by the consumer will depend on their functional characteristics.  ﬂavors from torula yeast, and Ohly  w  4 SAFETY AND QUALITY CONTROL OF  MICROBIAL PROTEIN PRODUCTS  The safety and acceptance of microbial protein products has to be strictly controlled, as in the case of all foods. The concepts underlying the acceptance and safety of novel protein sources including mycoprotein products were developed between 1970 and 1974 by the Protein Advisory Group of the United Nations  PAG , initially based on established toxicological experience. During the 70s the experience was accumulating with the incorporation of an increasing number of preparations of microbial origin, with more extensive trials in experimental and farm animals and preclinical and clinical testing  Scrimshaw 1985; Stringer 1985 . The main concepts contemplated in these guidelines  Anonymous 1975; Anonymous 1983a,b,c; Scrimshaw 1985 , which deﬁne the acceptance and quality control of microbial protein products are outlined below.   1  GRAS status organisms. Generally recognized as safe  GRAS  status may be granted to an organism by qualiﬁed experts either on the grounds of:  a  scientiﬁc studies which conﬁrm absence of toxic compounds and non-pathogenicity, and  b  in the case of a substance used prior to January 1, 1958, through experience based on common use in food  Code of Federal Regulations, 21 CFR 170.30, 182, 184, and 186 .  2  Absence of health hazards and toxic compounds in the product. No living cells derived from the fermentation process  original strain or contaminants  can be present in the ﬁnal product. Medium components that may be health hazards must also be absent. In case antifoams, detergents, or ﬂocculants are used in the fermentation process, they have to comply minimum safety requirements or be removed completely  Anonymous 1983c; Scrimshaw 1985 . Con- straints are placed upon the heavy metal content of the ﬁnal product. Typical maximum values are: ﬂuoride  F  150 ppm, lead  Pb  5 ppm, arsenic  As  2 ppm, mercury  Hg  0.1 ppm,  the product  although experience shows that the standard levels ﬁt well below these limits. In products of fungal origin, chemical analysis of absence of mycotoxins is considered essential  Scrimshaw 1985; Stringer 1985 .  3  Pathogenicity. The potential pathogenicity of a microorganism used for feeding, has been evaluated by the injection of the viable organism into the body cavity or body ﬂuids of a mammalian species. In this way the nonpathogenicity of a large number of microorganisms  S. cerevisiae, C. utilis; C. maltosa, C. lipolytica, and Torulopsis  has been evaluated  Stringer 1985 .  4  Integrity of the original strain. The maintenance of the integrity of the original strain and absence of undesirable contaminants has to be proved by speciﬁc microbiological and biochemical tests  Anonymous 1983c .  5  Continuous monitoring and control of process variables. To ensure quality and uniformity of the process variables  temperature, pH, aeration, cell concentration  have to be carefully monitored, and proof of such monitoring has to be presented.  6  Nucleic acid content. For animals or humans, nucleic acids coming from microbial protein sources added to the daily diet should not exceed 2 g per day  Anonymous 1975; Scrimshaw 1985 . This restriction does not apply for nonprimate mammalian species or other vertebrates  Stringer 1985 .  7  Toxicological and biochemical studies in animals. The required procedures for testing toxicology of microbial protein products are similar irrespective of whether the product is intended for animal and human feeding  Stringer 1985 . First, the tests include short and long-term classical animal toxicology tests, with rodents and other target species  e.g. broiler chicken and pig  and the species that will ﬁnally consume the product in its diet  Stringer 1985 . They consist of a complete battery of biochemical studies including effects on gross pathology, organ weight, and histopathological examination of the main organs and tissues  Anonymous 1983a .  8  Tolerance studies in humans. Clinical trials. Tolerance studies are used to determine the acceptance and the frequency of allergic and other undesirable reactions. The most common symptoms to be studied are gastrointestinal intolerance, skin rashes, and presence of other allergic reactions  Anonymous 1983b . The trials are conducted with a number of 50 or 100 individuals randomly assigned to experimental and control groups, stratiﬁed by sex, with careful report of all signiﬁcant effects, symptoms, changes in mood, appetite, libido or sleep patterns, monitored in a diary along two sets of four-week study periods  Scrimshaw 1985; Udall et al. 1984 . The ofﬁcial recommendations and guidelines of the PAG, part of them which have been brieﬂy described here, are made speciﬁc in the form of ofﬁcial speciﬁcations for each microbial protein product, which are ﬁnally referred in the Code of Federal Regulations, Codex Alimentarius  http:  www.codexalimentarius.net , AAFCO and other ofﬁcial publications, which are updated regularly. The ﬁnal control of the quality of the food product is regulated by speciﬁc ofﬁcial organizations and state food agencies through their respective directives. An example of the Food and Drug Administration  FDA, http:  www.fda.gov  in collaboration with the Association  this  is  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

The food agencies have to establish among others, the Compliance Policy Guides, current Good Manufacturing Practices  cGMP , ofﬁcial methods and mechanisms of inspection and control to be used to evaluate the quality and safety of food products. the AAFCO and FDA policy, a As an example of direct-fed microbial product listed by the AAFCO Ofﬁcial Publication and not labeled or promoted with any therapeutic function will be regulated as a “food” and usually will not require FDA regulatory attention.

In a global perspective, the existing regulations and quality control procedures, the compactness and high degree of control achieved in production of microbial protein processes, which can be manufactured under controlled factory conditions in compliance with GMP requirements, may provide a high degree of safety to the consumer, the uncertainties which regularly surround other food products.  taking into account  regulatory action,  against  5 CONCLUSIONS  Interest in mycoprotein and yeast biomass derived proteins has shifted since the mid twentieth century from a source of basic food, to specialty products which act as meat substitutes. This has been successfully achieved, and appears to be an expanding line. In addition, other products derived from biomass have been developed as food additives, which enhance the functional properties of other food-base formulations, such as ﬂavor, emulsifying properties, and texture. This tendency is likely to be reinforced in the foreseeable future, as the risk of new food episodes emerging from uncontrolled industrial production practices, such as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy  BSE , variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease  vCJD  or dioxin contaminations appear. In addition, some appreciated food stocks such as ﬁsh, appear to suffer increasing pressure, and limitations in catch quotas may in future bring in the development of mycoprotein-based ﬁsh substitutes. The increasing sophisti- cation of mycoprotein-based food technology will not only facilitate the appearance of diverse specialty products in the near future. It will remain, as it did before, an important technology base for the fast production of foods in logistically demanding conditions. These include war conﬂicts, famine crisis, or cases of declared but uncontrolled contamination of foods. The validity of these technologies for the production of food in the long term should be kept into consideration, given the practical advantages derived from compactness of the  installations, technique, and the recycling potential of the by-products.  the inherent safety of  the fermentation  The use of genetically modiﬁed fungi for the production of foods is an inspiring subject, given the massive potential that DNA technologies have provided for the generation of new products. However, the introduction of this technology into traditional industries is currently limited by public perception. An increasing number of research studies are focusing on the development of genetically modiﬁed fungi for application in the food industries  Dequin 2001; MacCabe et al. 2002 , but a very limited number of these studies have emerged in the form of new products or patents. Recently, a method of production of a fermented beverage using genetically modiﬁed yeast strains has been registered  US Patent 6326184 2001 . However, the majority of food companies avoid the use of genetically modiﬁed raw materials or strains, and traditional processes dominate the market. The application of these techniques into real products is still considered as a long term process, which will depend on public acceptance  Uzogara 2000 .  Our view is that there is a market for protein products of fungal origin, aimed at animal and human consumption, with the mycoprotein process  Quorn products  as a remarkable example. The success of the Quorn myco-protein process is determined by the product concept, where the business idea determines the design and development of process and product. Similar examples, applied to the production of new protein products from wild type and recombinant GRAS strains  Wolf 1996  will result in new processes and high value food products in the future.

Teresa Ferna´ndez-Espinar   Eladio Barrio University of Vale`ncia, Vale`ncia, Spain, Instituto de Agroquı´mica y Tecnologı´a de Alimentos, CSIC, Vale`ncia, Spain  1  INTRODUCTION  The ﬁrst use of yeast for winemaking is lost in the dawn of the ﬁrst agricultural civilizations. There are reports of wine- making as far as 7400 years ago. Until middle of the last millennium, wines were mainly produced around the Mediterranean Sea and the Caucasus. Since then, winemaking spread with the European colonizers throughout the temperate regions of the world  Pretorius 2000 . Until 1863, must fermentation was not well understood from a microbiological point of view. In that year, Pasteur showed that a living microorganism, the yeast, was responsible for the biotrans- formation of the sugar present in the must into ethanol and CO2. Although many genera and species of yeasts are found the genus Saccharomyces, and mainly the in the musts, species S. cerevisiae, is responsible for its biotransformation. Because of this, S. cerevisiae is referred as “the wine yeast”  Pretorius 2000 .  2 YEAST BIODIVERSITY IN WINERIES  2.1 Yeast Species Diversity During Viniﬁcation  All the investigations carried out on grape surfaces by direct isolation  without enrichment  have constantly shown that Hanseniaspora uvarum  anamorph: Kloeckera apiculata  is always the predominant inhabitant of the grape surface  75% of the cells ; this numerical supremacy may explain its initial domination in natural fermentations. Metschnikowia  pulcherrima is often present, followed by a group of ﬁlm- forming yeasts  Pichia anomala  or pigmented species  Rhodotorula sp. . In a general study of yeasts isolated from grapes, however, it was noticed that the proﬁle of yeast species may also vary from region to region  Martini and Vaughan-Martini 1990 . Numerous factors affect the total yeast population and the relative proportions of individual species on the grapes. These factors include climatological conditions, the grape variety and the degree of maturity at harvest, the use of fungicides and the physical damage of the grapes  Fleet and Heard 1992 . The yeast diversity found in wine-producing regions is strongly related to the the wine quality and organoleptic characteristics of produced from one year to another. However, the most signiﬁcant ﬁnding was that S. cerevisiae is practically absent  Martini and Vaughan-Martini 1990 . The presence or absence of S. cerevisiae on grapes is the subject of some debate. Some authors propose that this species is a “natural” organism present in plant fruits  Mortimer and Polsinelli 1999; Sniegowski et al. 2002 . Others argue that it is an artiﬁcial species that originated from the hybridization of other Saccharomyces species, and which then evolved over several centuries to become fully adapted to man-made environments such as wineries  Martini 1993 . Finally, some other authors postulate that S. cerevisiae is a domesticated species that originated from its closest relative, S. paradoxus, a wild species found all around the world that tree exudates, and fermenting plant extracts  Naumov 1996 .  from grapes and vineyard soils  is associated with insects,  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   2.2 Enzyme Activities of Non-Saccharomyces  Wine Yeasts  With respect to the role played by these non-Saccharomyces species in wine quality, they are known to have the capability to improve the wine aroma  Charoenchai et al. 1997; Esteve- Zarzoso et al. 1998 . The available aromas in the grape impart and deﬁne the characteristics and the ﬁnal quality of wine. Terpenic compounds account for most of these aromas. Grape processing liberates small quantities of aromatic terpenols; however, odorless precursors in the grape present a large, untapped reserve for wine aromas. Not only is the aroma an important quality factor in wine but also the intensity of the color is another very important quality factor in red wine, where anthocyanins are the main pigments. Various enzyme activities can improve the process of winemaking and enhance wine quality. The yeasts involved in wine making could be important producers of these enzymes  for a review see Table 1 .  3 MOLECULAR METHODS: INTER- AND  INTRA-SPECIFIC VARIABILITIES  The use of active dry yeasts is of particular interest to the wine industry, since the sensory properties of the ﬁnal product vary considerably from one year to another depending of the microbial ﬂora present on the grapes  Querol et al. 1990 . It is generally assumed that indigenous yeasts are suppressed by the starter; however, different studies show that indigenous yeasts can still participate in the fermentation  Schu¨tz and Gafner 1993; Querol et al. 1992a , although an implantation of only 50% was observed when fermentations were conducted by some commercial strains  Esteve-Zarzoso et al. 2000 . For these reasons, rapid and simple methods for the routine veriﬁcation of yeast strain present in fermentations would be useful to check the implantation of the starter.  Classical taxonomy is based predominantly on phenotypic characteristics, such as metabolic and or cell morphology  Kurtzman and Fell 1998 . However, nutritional character- istics have been shown to be highly variable as well as mutable, and genetic crosses have linked the characteristics to one or only a few genes  Petersen et al. 2000 , which in some  cases could lead to an incorrect classiﬁcation of a species or a false identiﬁcation of strains. Methods based on the analysis of total cell proteins  Guillamo´n et al. 1993  and long-chain fatty acids using gas chromatography have been used  Augustyn et al. 1991 , but their reproducibility is question- able because they depend on the physiological state of the yeast cells  Golden et al. 1994 .  Recent progress in molecular biology has led to the development of new techniques for yeast identiﬁcation and characterization  see Table 2 . Most of these techniques are useless for the routine identiﬁcation of yeasts and, most importantly, there is no available database to identify a large number of species. In addition, most of these techniques were applied to characterize only a few genera, and cannot be considered as a general method for yeast identiﬁcation. In the next sections, we review those methods that have been preferably applied in recent years and their application to the rapid identiﬁcation or speciﬁc characterization of wine yeasts in industrial practice.  3.1 Methods for Yeast Identiﬁcation  The speciﬁcity of nucleic acid sequences has prompted the development of several methods for rapid species identiﬁ- cation. The comparison of RNA  rRNA  and its template ribosomal DNA  rDNA  has been used extensively in recent years to assess both close and distant relationships among many kinds of organisms as a result of the existence of conserved sequences within this region, and the concerted evolution among units  Kurtzman and Robnett 1998 . Using the information from this region, different methods have been developed for yeast species identiﬁcation.  3.1.1 Ribosomal RNA Gene Sequencing  The determination and comparison of nucleotide sequences for the purpose of recognizing similarities or differences between organisms is at the heart of any molecular approach. Therefore, choosing the appropriate gene is paramount to the success or failure of any such sequence analysis between species. The 26S, 18S, 5.8S, and 5S ribosomal genes have undergone a relatively slow evolution, allowing for their use in the comparison of distantly related organisms.

The techniques have gained substantially from the introduction of the polymerase chain reaction, direct sequencing, and the availability of numerous nucleotide databases, which contain sequence information on a diverse range of organisms.  3.1.2 Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism  of RDNA  Recently, Esteve-Zarzoso et al.  1999  proposed a rapid and easy method for routine yeast identiﬁcation, based on RFLPs of the 5.8S rRNA gene and the internal transcribed spacers  ITS1 and 2 . They presented an initial database for the identiﬁcation of more than 132 yeast species belonging to 25 genera, most isolated from food. This is the ﬁrst available molecular method that provides information to identify a large number of yeast species in an easy and quick way. This  database has been improved to identify 300 yeast species  http.  motor.edinfo.es iata . Using this method, it is possible to identify yeasts from isolated colonies or directly from food samples  see Figure 1 . In addition, the anamorph and teleomorph forms yielded the same patterns and all the strains of the same species also exhibit the same pattern. Guillamo´n et al.  1998  used this method to identify 33 wine yeast species and Ferna´ndez-Espinar et al.  2000  identiﬁed all the species of the genus Saccharomyces, including the ﬂor yeast responsible for biological ageing in the process of making “ﬁno” sherry wine. The ﬂor S. cerevisiae strains exhibited restriction patterns different from those typical of the species S. cerevisiae, due to the presence of a 24-bp deletion located in the ITS1 region. Esteve-Zarzoso and Peris-Tora´n  2001  detected this speciﬁc “ﬂor” pattern in all the strains isolated from the velum of sherry wines from wineries located in Jerez, Spain.  Using the same methodology, but amplifying a different region  18S rRNA and ITS1  Dlauchy et al.  1999  also  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   constructed a database of restriction fragment patterns to identify 128 species associated mainly with food, and fermented drinks.  3.2 Methods for Yeast Characterization  Methods by which strains of the same species can be differentiated have been shown to be very important for yeast strain characterization. In winemaking, several studies have analyzed the diverse microﬂora of grapes and musts and several interesting methods have been developed  Figure 2 . PCR ampliﬁcation using intron splicing site  consensus sequences that ﬂank introns  displays polymorphism mainly at the within-species level  de Barros Lopes de et al. 1996 ; PCR ampliﬁcation of delta elements  repeat sequences that ﬂank the TY1 retrotransposons  has been widely used to characterize wine yeast strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae  Ness et al. 1993 . Another PCR-based approach, known as random ampliﬁed polymorphic DNA  RAPD , consists of the ampliﬁcation of random segments of DNA with a single and short  from 5- to 15-mer  primer of an arbitrary nucleotide sequence. The level of differentiation, either interspeciﬁc or intraspeciﬁc, depends highly on the primer used. However, one of the most important problems with this technique is the low stable  nonrepetitive  patterns obtained.  Figure 1 Scheme of the yeast identiﬁcation using Restriction fragment length polymorphism of the 5.8S rRNA and the internal transcribed spacers  Esteve-Zarzoso et al. 1999 .  The ampliﬁed fragment length polymorphism  AFLP  was used to investigate genetic variation in commercial strains and winery isolates  de Barros Lopes de et al. 1999 . It was proposed that AFLP is a very useful method for discriminat- ing yeasts at both species and subspecies levels, and also to characterize hybrids  de Barros Lopes de et al. 2002 . Although initially more labor intensive than other PCR techniques, the reproducibility of the results is the advantage over the previous PCR method described.  The analysis of mitochondrial DNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms  mtDNA-RFLP  has long been used as a method for characterizing wine yeast strains  Vezinhet et al. 1990 . However, due to the complexity associated with the procedure required to isolate a sufﬁcient amount of mtDNA, its use for routine analysis was limited until quite recently. The last decade has seen improvements in the process  Querol et al. 1992b , removing the need for specialized equipment and reducing the complexity and time scale, while retaining the discriminatory power and reproducibility  Figure 3 . This simpliﬁed technique has been used successfully to charac- terize yeast species belonging to genera Brettanomyces, Candida, Debaryomyces, Kluyveromyces, Saccharomyces, and Zygosaccharomyces  see Table 2 .  strains of  Chromosomal DNA proﬁle analysis  electrophoresis karyotyping . The analysis of chromosomal DNA poly- morphisms due to chromosome rearrangements has proved to be useful for the differentiation of species  and also strains  belonging to several genera, e.g., Candida, Kluyveromyces, Saccharomyces, and Zygosaccharomyces. In the case of wine yeast, it has been used for yeast characterization and was applied to analyse the dynamics of the yeast populations  Querol and Ramo´n 1996  and in the characterization of the industrial wine yeast  Ferna´ndez-Espinar et al. 2001 .  In the following section we will discuss the resolution of some of these techniques and their industrial application for the study of yeast population dynamics during natural and inoculated wine fermentations and for the characterization of S. cerevisiae strains of industrial interest.  3.3 Study of Yeast Population Dynamics During  Natural Wine Fermentations  Using mtDNA RFLP Querol et al.  1994  analyzed the population dynamics of Saccharomyces strains during spontaneous wine fermentations They found that despite the high diversity of strains observed at the beginning of the fermentation, very few dominated the process. However, when similarities in the mtDNA restriction pattern of the different S. cerevisiae strains  measured as the proportion of shared restriction fragments  were low, a clear sequential substitution of predominant strains was observed during each fermentation phase. When the similarity was high, even though a sequential substitution could also be observed between secondary strains, a clearly predominant strain was present during the whole fermentation process.

On the basis of chromosomal proﬁles, Frezier and Dubourdieu  1992  found that a small number of S. cerevisiae strains were capable of dominating fermenta- tions in the same winery over two vintages, independently of the grapevine cultivar. Vezinhet et al.  1992  investigated using mtDNA analysis and electrophoretic karyotyping the evolution of S. cerevisiae strains isolated during six consecutive years in the cellars of two vineyards. They concluded that the wide distribution of some strains in the  areas studied and their presence over a number of years constituted evidence for the occurrence of speciﬁc native strains representative of a particular wine region. Schu¨tz and Gafner  1994  proposed that the composition of yeast strain populations differs from must to must and from year to year. However, they also found strains isolated from two grape musts and from two vintages that presented very similar chromosome patterns to the commercial strain W27  Lallemand  isolated from the same region.  Figure 3 HinfI mtDNA restriction patterns of commercial wine yeast strains analyzed in Ferna´ndez-Espinar et al.  2001 .  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   Guillamo´n et al.  1996  have analyzed the correlation between genetic distance and ecological geographical factors using mtDNA restriction analysis and electrophoretic karyotyping. This constitutes the ﬁrst survey to investigate molecular variation among natural strains from different wine regions. They found signiﬁcant correlation between both ecological factors  e.g., grape varieties  and or geographical origin and the molecular relationships among strains. The analysis of genetic variation in natural years populations often results in the determination of the particular biological factors that inﬂuence population structure, hence population variations within and between wine regions have to be characterized to elucidate those factors that determine the distribution of variations in natural populations of S. cerevisiae.  3.4 Study of Yeast Population Dynamics During  Inoculated Wine Fermentations  Figure 4 Chromosomal proﬁles of commercial wine yeast strains analyzed in Ferna´ndez-Espinar et al.  2001 .  Using mtDNA restriction patterns, Querol et al.  1992a  conducted the ﬁrst study of population dynamics and the roles played by the active dry yeast strain and the natural Saccharomyces ﬂora during inoculated industrial fermenta- tions. It was demonstrated that the inoculated strains T73  Lallemand  compete with the natural strains but do not completely suppress their growth until three to six days after inoculation. However, the predominance of the inoculated strain was evident at the end of the fermentations.  Using physiological tests and karyotyping, Schu¨tz and Gafner  1993  analyzed the succession of three different dried yeasts at three different time points of wine fermentation. Hanseniaspora uvarum was present at the beginning of the fermentation, whereas only the inoculated strains of S. cerevisiae were observed in the middle and at the end of the fermentation. However, as a consequence of the few strains, these authors did not detect as much diversity as that observed by Querol et al.  1992a .  that  The use of active dry yeasts is of particular interest for the wine industry. It is generally assumed, as we discussed previously, indigenous yeasts are suppressed by the starter. However, some studies showed that native strains are better adapted to fermentation conditions than commercial strains  Esteve-Zarzoso et al. 2000; Esteve-Zarzoso and Peris-Tora´n 2001 .  3.5 Characterization of Commercial Wine Yeast  Strains  Since numerous yeast strains are being produced for the commercial wine market, it is interesting to study the degree of relatedness between commercial Saccharomyces strains. Ferna´ndez-Espinar et al.  2001  characterized 45 selected yeasts from 10 different yeast producers. Three molecular techniques, namely mtDNA restriction analysis  Figure 3 ,  electrophoretic karyotyping  Figure 4  and speciﬁc PCR of d sequences  Figure 2 , were used for this purpose. The maximum discriminatory power was obtained when the results of the three techniques were combined. The results showed evidence of mistakes during production or fraudulent practices by yeast producers, since the same strains commercialized under different names or the same name is used for different products by different companies.  3.6 Future Methods  The use of PCR in molecular microbiology has increased to the point where it is now accepted as the golden standard for detecting nucleic acids from a number of origins and has become an essential tool in the research laboratory. Real-time PCR has engendered wider acceptance of PCR, due to its improved rapidity, sensitivity, reproducibility, and the reduced risk of carry-over contamination  Mackay et al. 2002 . Traditional detection of ampliﬁed DNA relies upon electrophoresis of the nucleic acids in the presence of ethidium bromide and visual observation after irradiation by ultraviolet light. Southern blot detection of the amplicon using hybridization with a labeled oligonucleotide probe is also time consuming. The detection of the amplicon and the possibility of visualizing it as the ampliﬁcation progresses is the foundation of real-time PCR. The monitoring of the accumulation of the amplicon in real time has been made possible by the labeling of primers with ﬂuorogenic molecules. Due to the numerous advantages, these methods probably are an alternative to the techniques described previously, not only for the detection and identiﬁcation of spoilage yeast or for wine yeast monitoring during the alcoholic fermentation. Thus, this technology has also been applied in studies of yeast gene expression during the alcoholic fermentation.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

S. cerevisiae has a relatively small genome, a large number of chromosomes, little repetitive DNA, and few introns. Haploid strains contain approximately 12 – 13 megabases of nuclear DNA, distributed along 16 linear chromosomes whose sizes vary from 250 to 2000 kb  Barre et al. 1992; Pretorius 2000 . Most S. cerevisiae strains used in the laboratory are either haploid or diploid and have a deﬁned set of chromosome lengths. However, wine strains are mainly diploid, aneuploid, or polyploid  Codo´n and Benı´tez 1995 . Aneuploidy and polyploidy may confer advantages to adapt to variable external environments or, perhaps, is a way to increase the dosage of some genes important for fermentation  Bakalinsky and Snow 1990; Salmon 1997 . The meiotic segregants from wine strains diploidise with high frequency, indicating a high frequency of homothallism. Heterozygosity has been observed in both homothallic and heterothallic strains  Barre et al. 1992; Codo´n and Benı´tez 1995 .  Wine yeasts also show a high level of chromosome length polymorphism  Bidenne et al. 1992; Rachidi et al. 1999 . This polymorphism is generated mainly by illegitimate recombi- nation mediated by Ty transposons or subtelomeric repeated sequences. This feature has several practical consequences: sporulation ability is very variable, between 0 and 75% ascus formation can be observed on a sporulation medium and spore viability is also highly variable, ranging from 0 to 98%  Codo´n and Benı´tez 1995; Mortimer et al. 1994 .  4.2 Adaptive Evolution of Wine Yeast Strains  Although the origin of S. cerevisiae is a matter of controversy, its original genome has been subjected to strong selective pressures since its ﬁrst unconscious use in controlled fermentation processes. Useful phenotypic traits, such as fast growth in sugar-rich media, high alcohol production and tolerance, and good ﬂavor production, which have been selected over billions of generations, have had strong inﬂuences on the S. cerevisiae genome  Pe´rez-Ortı´n et al. 2002 . We now will analyze some of the molecular mechanisms that explain this wine yeast adaptation to viniﬁcation.  4.2.1 Stress Adaptation  During the alcoholic fermentation, yeast cells are subject to a number of stresses  Attﬁeld 1997 , the most important being osmotic and ethanol stresses. Osmotic stress is due to the high sugar content in the must and yeast cells must resist this stress  in order to start growing and to carry out the alcoholic fermentation. Ethanol stress is related to the progressive production of this compound throughout viniﬁcation. Alcohol is highly toxic to yeast metabolism and growth  Ingram and Buttke 1984  and the cell membrane is the primary target for its action. Also it is important to mention the stress due to glucose starvation, which could take place towards the end of the fermentation stage. Supraoptimal temperatures constitute another kind of stress conditions that can take place during fermentation, although it is not very signiﬁcant for most viniﬁcations, given the sophisticated temperature control systems currently used in wineries  Fleet and Heard 1992 . Similarly, adverse growth conditions, such as high ethanol and acetaldehyde concentrations and oxidative stress due to respiratory metabolism, can be found in the biological ageing of ﬁno sherry wine. Acetaldehyde is a known inhibitor of a wide range of metabolic activities and is more toxic than ethanol  Jones 1990 . Response to stress conditions requires transduction pathways, which the activation of signal involves the synthesis of protective molecules, including heat shock proteins. One of these proteins  Hsp104p  has been shown to be responsible for stress tolerance in laboratory yeast strains carrying out respiratory metabolism  Lindquist and Kim 1996 , but not for wine yeast strains growing under fermentation conditions in a glucose-rich medium  Carrasco et al. 2001  or for brewery yeast strains  Brosnan et al. 2000 . Aranda et al.  2002  analyzed the responses of several S. cerevisiae strains  some of them isolated during the production of ﬁno sherry wine  to several adverse conditions. In strains that are dominant during biological ageing, there was a clear correlation between resistance to ethanol and acetaldehyde, the high induction of HSP genes by these compounds and its presence as the predominant strain in most levels of several “soleras.” It is interesting to note that the dominant strains during biological ageing are the less resistant ones and the strains isolated during the alcoholic fermentation are more resistant to the osmotic stress.  4.2.2 Gene Expression Variability in Wine Yeast  The molecular basis of the technological properties of wine yeast strains are still largely unknown. However, the obvious possibility is that the adaptation of these strains to the enological environment is dependent on speciﬁc expression proﬁles of their genomes  for a review see Pe´rez-Ortı´n et al. 2002 . Comparative analyses of gene expression between industrial and nonindustrial strains and between different industrial strains could lead to the identiﬁcation of genes involved in the ﬁtness of in industrial environments. To date, the study of gene expression during wine fermentation has focused on genes induced in the stationary phase in order to express speciﬁc activities at the end of the process  Puig et al. 1996; Puig et al. 2000; Riou et al. 1997 .  the strains  Due to the different properties of the particular wine strains, it seems of great interest to study real commercial wine strains. Consequently, Puig et al.  1996 ; Puig and  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   Pe´rez-Ortı´n  2000  determined the levels and expression patterns of several genes during wine microviniﬁcations by using a commercial strain  T73, Lallemand . Genes such as POT1, HSP104, and SSA3, which are expressed late in laboratory culture conditions, are expressed in wine yeast cells only during the ﬁrst few days in microviniﬁcations. The reason for this could be the very different growth conditions used in microviniﬁcation  and therefore in real viniﬁcations  compared to those of laboratory conditions. Viniﬁcations are characterized by very high contents of glucose and fructose  20 – 25%  compared with the usual laboratory conditions  1 – 3% , and anaerobic conditions vs highly aerated laboratory conditions  Puig et al. 1996 .  the sequence of  The completion of  the genome of S. cerevisiae allowed the development of tools for the evaluation of the expression of the entire complement of genes encoded in the genome  transcriptome . The DNA microarray hybridization analysis was used to investigate how interesting genes change their expression during a biological process; several attempts have been made with wine yeast  Cavalieri et al. 2000; Backhus et al. 2001; Hauser et al. 2001 . The knowledge of genetic features as well as the speciﬁc expression proﬁles wine yeast strains under different growth conditions could help us to understand better the biological process of fermentation at the molecular level and how the gene expression is regulated in relation to changes in the physical and chemical properties of the growth medium. It is surprising that the genes involved in sulphur  SUL1-2  and ammonia  MEP2  transport  Cavalieri et al. 2000 , or that  sulphite efﬂux, SSU1  involved in sulﬁte resistance  Hauser et al. 2001 , were found to be overexpressed in wine yeast strains. They investigated in great detail the possible mechanisms for regulation of the expression of the SSU1 gene of the T73 wine yeast strain. A rearrangement of the promoter of SSU1 was detected, leading to up-regulation in its expression. This can be interpreted as being ﬁxed through its evolution as a result of the selective pressures imposed by winemaking procedures  Pe´rez-Ortı´n et al. 2002 .  4.2.3 Wine Yeast Genome Evolution  The ﬂexibility of the yeast genome to adapt to externally introduced environmental changes has been demonstrated in several experiments. Thus, it has postulated that an ancient duplication of the entire yeast genome may have been instrumental in its evolutionary adaptation to anaerobic, fermentative growth by providing new and specialized gene functions  Wolfe and Shields 1997 . Wine yeast strains have the ability to reorganize their chromosomes during mitotic growth  Longo and Vezinhet 1993 . In contrast to laboratory strains, wine yeast strains seem not to remain genetically uniform because of this exacerbated capacity to undergo genomic changes  Pretorius 2000 . A reason for this is the ability of many “natural” strains to change their mating type when haploid  homothallism . Using this capability, yeast cells could evolve very quickly by means of three successive steps: sporulation  producing haploid cells thorough meiotic  reduction , mating type switching of the daughter cells and conjugation with any of the mothers of the same single-spore colony  Mortimer et al. 1994 . This process  called “genome renewal”  would produce highly homozygous strains that eliminate deleterious mutations by natural selection. Yeast strains, however, are usually aneuploid  Bakalinsky and Snow 1990; Guijo et al. 1997  and heterozygous for many loci  Barre et al. 1992; Kunkee and Bisson 2000 , which is not in agreement with the genome renewal hypothesis  Puig et al. 2000 . There are several other ways in which wine strains change over time. Apart from spontaneous mutation, which occurs at comparatively very low rates, Ty-promoted chromosomal translocations  Rachidi et al. 1999 , mitotic crossing-over  Seehaus et al. 1985  and gene conversion will provoke faster adaptation to environmental changes  Puig et al. 2000 . Extra copies of chromosome XIII, which contains the alcohol dehydrogenase genes ADH2and ADH3, are found in ﬂor wine yeasts, these genes are of special interest to oxidize ethanol  Guijo et al. 1997 . Finally,  Pe´rez-Ortı´n et al. 2002  found that the SSU1-R allele, which confers sulﬁte resistance to yeast cells, is the product of a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes VIII and XVI due to unequal crossing-over mediated by microhomology between 0 upstream regions of the SSU1 very short sequences on the 5 and ECM34 genes, which put the SSU1 coding region under the control of the ECM34 promoter. They also showed that this translocation is only present in wine yeast strains, suggesting that the use of sulﬁte as a preservative in wine production over millennia could have favored its selection. This is the ﬁrst time that a gross chromosomal rearrangement has been shown to be involved in the adaptive evolution of S. cerevisiae.

Jakobsen The Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University, Frederiksberg, Denmark  1  INTRODUCTION  Yeast have been isolated from all kinds of dairy products  Fleet 1990; Fleet and Mian 1987; Jakobsen and Narvhus 1996; Rohm et al. 1992; Tilbury et al. 1974 . Yeast are used as important starter cultures in food products such as bread, beer, wine, traditional fermented foods  Fleet 1990; Fleet and Mian 1987; Jakobsen and Narvhus 1996  and seems to be the most important micro-organism exploited by man. The role of yeast as micro-organisms, which could have a positive inﬂuence on the quality of dairy products, especially cheese, has not been widely accepted  Fleet 1990; Jakobsen and Narvhus 1996 . Instead, yeasts have often been seen as spoilage organisms originating from poor hygiene and sanitation  Fleet and Mian 1987; Jakobsen and Narvhus 1996 . The nutritional requirement of yeast, the ability to grow at low temperature, low pH, low moisture content, and high salt or sugar concentrations together with their enzymatic activity make yeast a natural part of the microbiota in dairy products. In 1995 the ﬁrst symposium on “Yeasts in the dairy industry: Positive and Negative Aspects” was organized and held by the International Dairy Federation  IDF  expert group F47—Yeast. As reﬂected in the published literature the interest in the dairy industry has increased since and the knowledge of the positive and negative role played by yeast in dairy products has become more detailed. The key areas have been:  a  study of important technological characteristics of yeast, e.g., proteolytic and lipolytic activity, aroma formation and fermentation and or assimilation of residual sugars and lactate and citrate and pigment formation especially related to different kind of cheese;  b  properties affecting both the negative role of yeast as spoilage organism causing quality defects as well as the potential of yeast as highly controlled  in yeast  starter cultures;  c  yeast classiﬁcation and taxonomy based upon molecular methods. The present review will deal with the positive and negative aspects of yeast in the dairy industry.  A variety of yeast species has been isolated from milk and dairy products  Fleet 1990; Fleet and Mian 1987; Gadaga et al. 2001; Rohm et al. 1992; Roostita and Fleet 1996a,b; van den Tempel and Jakobsen 1998; Tilbury et al. 1974; Tudor and Board 1993; Westall 1998  but a few main species are frequently detected in dairy products. These yeast are representatives of the genea Debaryomyces, Klyveromyces, Yarrowia, Candida, and Saccharomyces  Viljoen 2001 . The yeast occur both in the teleomorphic and the anamorphic state in dairy products, depending on the yeasts’ ability to produce ascospores. Some of the most common yeast related to dairy products mentioned ﬁrst by their teleomorphic then by their anamorphic state are: Debaryomyces hansenii Candida famata, Galactomyces geotrichum Geotrichum candidum, Yarrowia lipolytic Candida lipolytica, Klyveromyces marxianus Candida Kefyr, Klyveromyces lactis var. lactis  Candida spherical, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Candida robusta.  To describe yeast occurring in dairy products and select and maintain yeast as a starter culture, identiﬁcation at subspecies level is a necessity. The taxonomy of yeast is mainly based on the criteria described in the third and fourth edition of the taxonomical study “The Yeasts” edited by Kreger van Rij  1984  and Kurtzman and Fell  1998 , respectively. The criteria includes micro- and macro- morphology in standard media, assimilation, and fermenta- tion proﬁles of standard carbohydrates, growth at different temperatures and under deﬁned osmotic pressure, develop- ment of pseudo or true mycelium, formation of ascospores as well as other phenotypic criteria. It takes time and experience  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   to conduct a correct classical identiﬁcation. Therefore, easier identiﬁcation systems like API-ZYM systems  Biomerieux, Macy l’Etoile, France  are widely used. The API-test is based on assimilation proﬁles of the yeast. The API-kit’s were originally made to offer a fast identiﬁcation of yeast of medical importance. Several investigations have found food- related yeasts that were not included in the reading key of the kit  Dea´k and Beuchat 1988 . The enlarged version of the test, API-kit 32C, has been found to be reliable in assisting in yeast identiﬁcation and acceptable for a rapid identiﬁcation of yeasts associated to cheese, as long as it is used in combination with the classical methods, especially when a reliable determination of the sexual form is required, for the identiﬁcation  van den Tempel 2000 . Other methods based on criteria such as proﬁles of volatile metabolites of the yeast  Magan et al. 2001; Westall 1998 , analysis of volatile proﬁles of yeast by an electronic nose  Magan et al. 2001  and identiﬁcation based on Fourier-transform of the speciﬁc infrared spectrum of the biochemical compounds of the dried yeast cell  Ku¨mmerle et al. 1998  have been reported as methods for fast identiﬁcation at species level.  The number of yeast genera and yeast species has increased 100% or more since 1970 where the ﬁrst edition of “The Yeasts” was published. At the same time yeast species described as belonging to different genera or species have been proven to belong to the same species. This shows the complexity of the yeast taxonomy but also the growing interest in yeast classiﬁcation. One of the major reasons for the changes in yeast classiﬁcation and taxonomy is the use of molecular methods including analyses of whole chromo- somes and as with other micro-organisms, the classiﬁcation of yeast is based more and more on genotypic rather than phenotypic criteria for yeast isolated from dairy products. Several methods have been reported for taxonomical use, for e.g., molecular techniques using SDS-gelelectrophoresis of whole-cell protein pattern, pulse ﬁeld gelelectrophoresis  PFGE   Montrocher et al. 1998; Esteve-Zarzoso et al. 1999; Gente et al. 2002; Jespersen and Ku¨hle 2000 , restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of mitochondrial DNA  DNA-RFLP   Petersen et al. 2002; Romano et al. 1996; van den Tempel and Jakobsen 2000 , internal genomic spacer sequences  IGS , 18S rRNA analysis  Cappa and Cocconcelli 2001  and polymerase chain reaction—restriction fragment length polymorphism  PCR-RFLP  analysis of the intergenic transcribed spacer region  ITS   Caggia et al. 2001; Petersen et al. 2001 . However, for many of the yeast genera related to dairy products the molecular methods are not yet fully developed or sensitive enough to separate strains on species or subspecies level.  2 PROTEOLYTIC ACTIVITY  Published results on the proteolytic activity of yeast isolated from dairy products are mainly based upon the ability to produce a clearing zone in casein and skim milk agar. It has been demonstrated  Hansen and Jakobsen 2001; Larsen et al.  that  the agar diffusion tests may not offer  1998  the sensitivities required to detect proteolytic activity. Methods such as gelelectrophoresis, high performance liquid chroma- tography  HPLC , or capillary electrophoresis  CE  give a different and more detailed picture, which also demonstrates that the proteolytic activity of yeast is strain speciﬁc  Hansen and Jakobsen 2001; van den Tempel 2000 . Several studies of strains of D. hansenii have indicated that the examined strains could not degrade casein  Hansen and Jakobsen 1997 . However, low proteolytic activity was observed in D. hansenii isolated from Picante cheese  Freitas et al. 1999  and blue veined cheese  van den Tempel 2000 . Similar variability in the proteolytic activity for strains of K. lactis has been observed  Grieve et al. 1983; Hansen and Jakobsen 1997; Roostita and Fleet 1996a . However, Grieve et al.  1983  did show that a strain of K. lactis was able to hydrolyze a-, b-, and k-casein, which indicates that some strains are able to contribute to the maturation of cheese.  Gueguen and Lenoir  1975  examined 30 strains of G. geotrichum and found that they produced extracellular and intracellular proteinases and peptidases. Extracellular activity was present in 66% of the strains, which could be divided into two groups of 25% showing high proteolytic activity and 75% having low proteolytic activity. Optimum pH for the proteolytic activity was close to 5.5. Other investigations of commercial strains of G. geotrichum used in cheese production showed that the proteolytic activity was weak when present.  Yarrowia lipolytica produces several proteinases and many of these are extracellular. The secretion of both alkaline and acid proteinases has been detected  Ogrydziak et al. 1982; Vasileva-Tonkova et al. 1996 . The activity of the extracellular acid proteinase at pH 5.2 was optimal at 158C but was signiﬁcantly reduced at 88C. Many investigations of Y. lipolytica have shown that different strains of Y. lipolytica have proteolytic activity and are able to breakdown all the casein components.  Freitas et al. 1999; van den Tempel and Jakobsen 2000; Wyder and Puhan 1999  and seems to be at the same level as a strong proteolytic strains of P. roqueforti  van den Tempel 2000 .  Candida catenulata seems to have a high proteolytic activity similar to the level of Y. lipolytica  Roostita and Fleet 1996a , but detailed studies have not been reported.  Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be proteolytic but  the majority of strains do not show proteolytic activity  Hansen and Jakobsen 1997; Hansen and Jakobsen 2001; Roostita and Fleet 1996a . The proteolytic activity was studied by Hansen and Jakobsen  2001  using CE for ﬁve selected Saccharo- myces spp. being a commercial starter cultures in blue veined cheese, an isolats from blue veined cheeses, a type strains of Saccharomyces spp. and two starter cultures of Saccharo- myces spp. used in other food fermentation. The CE results for the ﬁve strains showed that only the commercial blue cheese strain of S. cerevisiae could break down casein. The CE-proﬁles showed that S. cerevisiae was able to hydrolyze some of the as1-and b-casein. Differences in the CE-proﬁles indicated a synergistic effect in the degradation of casein by  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   S. cerevisiae and Penicillium roqueforti, seen as higher number and different grouping of peptides when grown together compared to growth of the individual culture.  3 LIPOLYTIC ACTIVITY  Almost all yeast related to cheese have esterase activity and are able to hydrolyze tributyrin  Fleet and Mian 1987; Hansen and Jakobsen 1997; Roostita and Fleet 1996a; van den Tempel and Jakobsen 1998 . This applies for D. hansenii, K. lactis, S. cerevisiae and Y. lipolytica, C. catenulata and C. geotrichum, all showing esterase activity.  The reported results on the esterase activity of D. hansenii, K. lactis, and S. cerevisiae are contradicting  Besancon et al. 1992; Fleet and Mian 1987; Hansen and Jakobsen 1997; Roostita and Fleet 1996a; van den Tempel and Jakobsen 1998 . But in general the activity is low. Tested in API-ZYM systems  Biomerieux, Macy l’Etoile, France , S. cerevisiae, D. hansenii, and K. lactis could hydrolyze the fatty acid with chain length of C:8, but not the fatty acid with a chain length of C:14  Hansen and Jakobsen 2001 . Lipolysis of long-chain fatty acids has been demonstrated for Y. lipolytica, C. catenulata, and C. geotrichum and the activity seems to be at the same level for the three yeasts  Roostita and Fleet 1996b; van den Tempel 2000 .  Isolation of several intra and extracellular lipases from Y. lipolytica has been reported and the strong lipolytic activity of Y. lipolytica seems mainly to be due to extracellular lipases with optimal activity at pH 6 – 10  Destain et al. 1997; Pereira- Meirelles and Rocha-Lea˜o 1997 . Some of the reported lipases are quite stable and are still active after 370 days at 58C  Pereira-Meirelles and Rocha-Lea˜o 1997 . To demon- strate the extent of the lipolytic activity of Y. lipolytica, ﬁve strains were compared with ﬁve different strains of P. roqueforti with medium to high lipolytic activity. It was found that the lipolytic activity was twice the activity of the strongest lipolytic strain of P. roqueforti  van den Tempel and Jakobsen 2000 . Investigations comparing lipolytic activity after growth under different condition showed that the lipolytic activity was depending on pH, temperature, and the growth media  Hansen and Jakobsen 1997; van den Tempel 2000 .  4 YEAST IN DAIRY PRODUCTS  4.1 Farm Milk  from cows with or without mastitis. Yeast were detected in more than 50% of samples from quarters with mastitis infections, but only in 25% of the samples from the noninfected quarters  Lagneau et al. 1996 . Yeast have been detected in the number of 103 cfu ml in pasteurized milk  Fleet and Mian 1987; Lagneau et al. 1996; van den Tempel and Jakobsen 1998  and most of the common species in raw milk were able to grow to 108 or 109 cfu ml in UHT milk even at low temperatures  Fleet and Mian 1987; Roostita and Fleet 1996b . Spoilage of raw milk and pasteurized milk by yeast are not reported as a very common problem. The occurrence of yeast in raw milk is assumed to be a contamination source of other dairy products. Reported investigations using molecular techniques to follow yeast at subspecies level through the whole production and to trace the origin of the yeast are limited.  In sweetened condensed milk the low water activity, due to high concentrations of sugar favor yeast as a potential spoilage organism while bacterial growth is inhibited. Yeasty taste and ﬂavor and gas production are known spoilage by yeast in this product  Walker and Ayers 1970 .  4.2 Cream and Butter  Yeast have been reported to cause spoilage such as yeasty ﬂavor and foamy appearance in all kind of cream products  Fleet and Mian 1987; Walker and Ayers 1970 . In an Australian study 48% of the examined cream samples in the range of 103 – 104 cfu ml while a contained yeast number of 104 – 105 were found in 14% of the samples  Fleet and Mian 1987 . The yeast identiﬁed in the study were mainly C. famata, Rhodotorula glutinis, C. difﬂuens, Cryptococcus laurentii, and R. rubra. These yeast species all showed high lipolytic activity and were able to grow at 58C.  An investigation from Italy showed yeast in 4 out of 5 butter samples examined  Minervini et al. 2001  The detected yeast included C. kefyr, C. guilliermondii, and S. cerevisiae in concentrations of 103 – 105 cfu g  Minervini et al. 2001 . In 1987 Fleet and Mian found yeast in 7 out of 16 butter samples. The yeast occured in numbers below 103 per gram and belonged mainly to the species R. glutinis and Rhodotorula rubra. Lipolytic yeast on the butter surface has also been reported  Walker and Ayers 1970 , but all together the literature on this subject is very limited.  4.3 Yoghurt  in raw milk is found to be Often the level of yeast 102 – 104 cells=ml  Lagneau et al. 1996; van den Tempel and Jakobsen 1998 . The dominant yeast species detected in raw milk in Denmark, Italy, and Belgium were found to be C. famata, C. lipolytica, and Trichosporon cutanum  Corbo et al. 2001; Lagneau et al. 1996; van den Tempel and Jakobsen 1998 . The study of raw milk in Belgium indicated that yeast count was depending on whether the milk came  Yoghurt is an acidic fermented milk product, which normally has acetaldehyde in the ﬁnal aroma. It is made of milk inoculated with thermophilic lactic acid starter cultures. During fermentation about 35% of the lactose is hydrolyzed to glucose and galactose. The glucose is metabolized to lactic acid while galactose remains in the environment of the yoghurt  Goodenough and Klein 1976 . Therefore, galactose  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   fermenting yeast strains in particular are known to cause spoilage of yoghurt  Caggia et al. 2001; Giudici et al. 1996 . Yoghurt is often added nuts, honey, preserved or dried fruit, containing sucrose and is a source of yeast infections. Yeast spoilage of yoghurt is seen as excessive gas production followed by swelling of the package, unpleasant yeasty odor and taste, changes in texture and color, and formation of visible yeast colonies  Caggia et al. 2001; Fleet and Yeasts 1998 .  With intervals, studies of yeast in retail yoghurt have been reported from different countries. It is not unusual to detect yeast in yoghurt in numbers of 103 cells g, and yeast count up to 108 cells g has been reported. The contamination rate of yeast in yogurt were in the order of 103 for 20% of the examined samples in United Kingdom  Davis 1975  and Canada  Arnott et al. 1974 .  The most common yeast species reported in yoghurt are famata D. hanseniil, Pichia anaomala, C. versalitilis, C. S. cerevisiae, and K. lactis. These yeast are able to assimilate and ferment several of the main carbohydrates in plain and fruit yoghurt. They are also able to assimilate lactate and citrate. They grow at low pH-values and temperatures below 108C. Further several are able to produce esterases and lipases, proteinases and peptidases hydrolyzing the milk fat and protein. Therefore the occurrence of yeast even in low numbers in yogurt will limit the shelf-life  Fleet 1990 .  The occurrence and growth of yeast in yoghurt are closely related to poor hygiene and sanitation  Fleet and Mian 1987 . As emphasized by Fleet  1990 ; Jakobsen and Narvhus  1996  spoilage should be prevented through implementation of general principles of good manufacturing practice. To extend the shelf-life of yoghurt the use of preservatives are permitted in some countries. However, yeast can be very tolerant to some preservatives. As an example C. famata and K. maxianus are still able to multiply in the presence of sorbate and benzoate at concentrations of 500 mg l  Fleet and Mian 1987 .  4.4 Kefyr  As a sign of immortality Allah granted a chosen tribe the ﬁrst kefyr grain and therefore the grains were called grains of the prophet. In another version of this tale the grains were given by the prophet Mohammed as a present as a sign of immortality together with the recipe of kefyr, but it was forbidden to give away the grains or the recipe otherwise the grains would lose their healing power. These tales has been used as an explanation why the preparation of kefyr was kept as a secret for so long. Even though, the history of this product is centuries old  Wouters et al. 2002  the ﬁrst production of retail kefyr was made in the former USSR in the 1930s  Wyder 1998 .  Kefyr originates from Caucasus in Central Asia, but has become popular in many countries especially in the Middle East. Kefyr is an acidic and mildly alcoholic fermented milk beverage with a high level of CO2. Traditional kefyr is prepared in bags from goat hides, from either cow, sheep, or  goat milk inoculated with kefyr grains  Motaghi et al. 1997 . Kefyr grains are white, yellowish hard granules with shape as cauliﬂower. They are a result of a symbiotic microﬂora that are encapsulated in grains made of a ﬁbrous matrix of coagulated casein, polysaccharides, fat and lysed cells. The polysaccharides in the kefyr grains differ from other known polysaccharides and are called kefyran  Wyder 1998 . The relative low temperature in the region of Caucasus where kefyr originated led to a natural selection of mesophilic yeast, lactic and acetic acid bacteria in the kefyr grains  Motaghi et al. 1997; Wyder 1998 . Interactions between the micro- organisms have been reported  Koroleva 1988 . The yeast stimulated the growth of the lactic acid bacteria releasing vitamins and amino acids and causing an increase in pH metabolizing lactic acid  Koroleva 1988 . Several different composition of the microbiota in kefyr grains has been detected. The composition depends on different cultivating techniques of the kefyr grain, which is connected to the origin and temperature of the production site  Berger et al. 1999 . The origin and temperature of the production site also have inﬂuence on the development of alcohol and CO2 and then the ﬁnal aroma and the viscosity of the kefyr. The main yeast species detected in Kefyr are K. marxianus, C. kefyr, S. cerevisiae, S. delbrueckii  Wouters et al. 2002 . In the industrial production of kefyr consistency in quality is a must. Therefore, retail kefyr is seldom produced using kefyr grains; instead commercial kefyr cultures are based on a mixture of pure cultures isolated from kefyr grains inoculated in milk. Commercial kefyr cultures contain only yeast in very low concentration if any. Gas production by the yeast causes the package to blow and consumers seem to ﬁnd swelling of the package undesirable in retail kefyr.  4.5 Other Fermented Milk Products  Another well-known fermented milk produced with a natural yeast microﬂora is koumiss. Koumiss is like a milk wine with an alcohol percentage around 2 and a ﬁnal pH about 4. In the beginning of the 1900 century koumiss was described as the greatest of the fermented milks as reviewed by Steinkraus  1996 . Koumiss originates from Khazakstan and is traditionally made from mare’s milk but variants made from cows milk has been reported  Steinkraus 1996 . The dominating microﬂora in koumiss is thermophilic lactic acid bacteria and Saccharomyces spp. especially S. unisporus and K. marxianus  Montanari et al. 1996 .  in several  Yeast are also present  indigenous African fermented milk products such as amasi hodzeko from Zimbabwe  Gadaga et al. 2001 , banik from Senegal  Gningue et al. 1991 , rob from Sudan  Abdelgadir et al. 2001 , nono from Nigeria  Okagbue and Bankole 1992 , and ergo and ititu from Ethiopia  Gonfa et al. 2001 . All traditional fermented milks are prepared by allowing raw milk to spontaneously ferment at ambient temperature. Lactic acid bacteria and yeast with S. cerevisiae, K. marxianus, K. lactis, and C. kefyr as dominating yeast are part of the natural  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   microﬂora and it is assumed that yeast play an important role in the microbial interactions between the different micro- organisms and development of the characteristic aroma in these products. Traditional fermented milks are made in many households daily. These milks products represent an important source for human of energy, protein, vitamins, and minerals  Loretan et al. 1998 . Because of the socio- economic changes that are taking place in Africa some of the traditional fermentation technologies might be lost together with the related microﬂora  Loretan et al. 1998 . Therefore, interest in traditional African fermented milk is increasing, especially examination and identiﬁcation of the high number of lactic acid bacteria and yeast and exploration of their role in the fermentation process of the milk  Loretan et al. 1998 .  4.6 Cheeses  Yeast are detected and isolated from all sorts of cheeses  Bockelmann and Hoppe-Seyler 2001; de Boer and Kuik 1987; Nooitgedagt and Hartog 1988; Roostita and Fleet 1996a; Schmidt and Lenoir 1980; van den Tempel and Jakobsen 1998; Tzanetakis et al. 1998; Vivier et al. 1994; Welthagen and Viljoen 1998 . The number of yeast can be in the range 104 cfu g or even higher. The most common yeast species in cheese are D. hansenii, Y. lipolytica, G. geotrichum, K. lactis, K. maxianus, and S. cerevisiae with D. hansenii as the most predominant. The development of yeast in cheese occurs spontaneously while controlled use of yeast as starter cultures in cheese is used for production of some kind of mold ripened cheeses and smear ripened cheeses, but seldom for other types of cheese.  Until recently it was assumed that the yeast in cheese primarily originated from the cheese brine. Cheeses are often salted in brines containing 22 – 25% NaCl  Hansen et al. 2001  and often the brine is not changed or pasteurized between the salting of different batches leading to accumulation of salt tolerant yeast  Tudor and Board 1993  in the range of 102 – 106 cfu g  Devoyod and Sponem 1970; Rohm et al. 1992; Seiler and Busse 1990; van den Tempel and Jakobsen 1998 . It has also been suggested that the yeast in cheese originated from raw milk because of the survival of yeast through pasteurization  van den Tempel 2000; Vadillo et al. 1987 . In a study carried out by Petersen et al.  2002  the successions of yeast on the surface of Danbo was followed using mtDNA RFLP. The investigation showed that the dominating ﬂora after 4 days belongs to D. hansenii and that the dominating strain did not originate from raw milk, brine, or the starter culture, but from the dairy “house microﬂora,” which also includes yeast from air in the ripening room, ripening pads and humans. This indicates that cheese quality depends on an intact “house microﬂora” where the balance easily can be disturbed because the cheese surface in many ways is exposed to the environment of the dairy with its inherent population of micro-organisms  Bockelmann and Hoppe-Seyler 2001 .  Examinations of different kinds of cheese showed that the yeast population often develops from a heterogeneous to a homogeneous population during the ripening period  Bockelmann and Hoppe-seyler 2001; Hansen et al. 2001; Petersen et al. 2002; van den Tempel and Jakobsen 1998 . Yeast need an energy source to grow, therefore the ability to assimilate or ferment residual carbohydrates and acids is important for the yeasts in order to survive in the cheese and to compete with other micro-organisms during ripening  Roostita and Fleet 1996b . But also the general tolerance towards NaCl of yeasts and the effect of NaCl on the uptake of lactate and other carbohydrates is important  Petersen et al. 2002 . The assimilation of different carbohydrates seems to be affected by the microenvironment in the cheese. Investigations of D. hansenii showed that the assimilation of lactate  Petersen et al. 2002; van den Tempel and Jakobsen 2000  and citrate  van den Tempel and Jakobsen 2000  was strain speciﬁc and that inhibitions for some strains occurred at 6%  w v  NaCl while other strains could assimilate both citrate and lactate in the presence of 14%  w v  NaCl  van den Tempel and Jakobsen 2000 . Similar results were seen for assimilation of lactose and galactose. The same pattern was observed for Y. lipolytica though inhibition already occurred at low levels of salt, i.e., 2 %  w v  NaCl for some of the strains examined  van den Tempel and Jakobsen 2000 .  4.6.1 Yeast in Surface Ripened Cheese  Semi-soft and soft cheeses that develop a smear of microbial growth on the surface during maturation are called surface ripened cheese. These cheeses have maturation times that vary from several days to month and at temperature ranging from 10 to 208C. Some examples of these cheeses are Limburger, Danbo, Brick, and Tilsiter  Fleet 1990; Bockelmann and Hoppe-Seyler 2001; Petersen et al. 2002 . The microbial smear on the surface of these cheeses is very important for the maturation process and play a major role for the ﬁnal cheese quality  Bockelmann 2002; Bockelmann and Hoppe-Seyler 2001; Fleet 1990; Jakobsen and Narvhus 1996 . The cheese smear is a bio-mass of yeast and bacteria  Bockelmann and Hoppe-Seyler 2001; Fleet 1990; Fleet and Mian 1987; Masoud and Jakobsen 2003 . The yeast species D. hansenii seems to be dominant and also the most important yeast during the whole maturation time but depending on the type of cheese other yeast such as Trichosporon spp., Y. lactis, and Candida spp. have been detected during the ﬁrst day of ripening  Bockelmann 2002; Fleet 1990; Petersen et al. 2002 . The bacterial ﬂora consists of Brevibacterium lines, Arthobacter spp., Corynebacterium spp., Micrococcus and Staphylococcus spp.  Bockelmann 2002; Bockelmann and Hoppe-Seyler 2001; Fleet 1990 .  lipolytica, K.  spp.,  The microbial ecology of the smear is very complex, but during the ﬁrst days of cheese ripening a natural selection takes place  Petersen et al. 2002 . The most suitable group of yeast in the surface ripened cheese, seems to adapt easily to the microenvironment with high NaCl concentration, low pH,  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   and lactate as a main carbon source. Among the yeast D. hansenii in most cases grow fast and become the dominant species. It has been observed a particular subspecies out range the other strains and become dominant of D. hansenii present  Petersen et al. 2002 .  The growth of D. hansenii on the surface of the cheese enhances the growth of the smear bacteria  Valde´s-Staber et al. 1997  by metabolizing the lactate  Le Clercq-Perlat et al. 1999 . After 4 – 7 days the pH increases from 5.2 to 5.7 allowing more acid-sensitive bacteria like B. linens to grow  Bockelmann and Hoppe-Seyler 2001; Petersen et al. 2002; Valde´s-Staber et al. 1997 . The number of yeast begin to decrease after one or two weeks of ripening while the bacteria dominates on the cheese surface during the last part of the ripening period  Bockelmann 2002; Petersen et al. 2002 . Furthermore, yeast appears to support the bacterial growth by release of vitamins and amino acids  Viljoen 2001 . Investigations carried out by Masoud and Jakobsen  2003  showed that D. hansenii had a signiﬁcant effect on the intensity of the reddish pigment produced by the bacteria ﬂora. Signiﬁcant differences were observed between the D. hansenii strains examined but also the NaCl content and pH played a important role in the pigment production.  4.6.2 Yeast in Blue Mold Cheeses  Blue mold cheeses are semi-soft cheeses primarily ripened by growth of the mold P. roqueforti. Blue cheeses normally have a signiﬁcally higher content of NaCl compared to surface ripened cheeses and white mold cheeses. The NaCl concentration in blue mold cheeses after brining is 0.2%  w w  in the core and 7%  w w  in the surface layer. After eight weeks of maturation NaCl concentration is approxi- mately 2.0%  w w  in the core and 4.0%  w w  in the surface layer. The pH after 24 hours is at the level pH 4.6 – 4.7. During ripening, pH in the core increases to about 6.5 and to 5.9 in the surface layer  Gobbetti et al. 1997; Godinho and Fox 1982; Hansen et al. 2001 .  To permit air into enter the cheese center and carbon dioxide to escape the cheeses are pierced before maturation which also affect yeast growth. In blue veined cheese, yeasts are detected in high levels, without affecting cheese quality negatively  Fleet 1992; Hansen et al. 2001; van den Tempel 2000 . The number of yeasts detected in blue mold cheese is in the order of 107 – 108 cfu g on the surface and 105 – 106 cfu g in the core, but higher concentrations have been observed  Hansen et al. 2001; van den Tempel and Jakobsen 1998 . The most common yeasts isolated from raw milk cheeses like Roquefort are D. hanseniiIC. lipolytica  C. lactis  C. spherica  Besanc¸on et al. 1992; Roostita and Fleet 1996a . In Mycella, which is made from pasteurized milk, the predominant yeasts isolated from both the core and the surface is D. hanseniilC. famata but in the beginning of like Zygosaccharomyces spp., the maturation other yeast G. geotrichum Y. lipolytica, and C. rugosa are seen, in low  lipolytica, C. kruseii, T. cutaneum, and K.  famata, C. catenulata, Y.  numbers  Hansen et al. 2001 . In four-week old Danablu, the most common yeast are D. hansenii  van den Tempel and Jakobsen 1998 . Examinations of Danablu produced at four different dairies and the Danish blue cheese Mycella showed that the yeast population developed from a heterogeneous ﬂora to a homogeneous ﬂora of D. hansenii during the ripening period  Hansen et al. 2001; van den Tempel and Jakobsen 1998 .  Yeast are considered to play an important role in the ripening of blue mold cheese and seems to contribute positively to microbial environment by assimilation of the residual carbohydrates and acids. Yeast are assumed to create a stable microenvironment, which prevent undesired microbial growth. The gas produced in the curd during fermentation is likely to create minor ﬁssures and chinks in the cheese curd, which is assumed to promote the development of P. roqueforti  Coghill 1979 . Positive interactions have been detected between D. hansenii and P. roqueforti under conditions simulating the environment in Danablu  van den Tempel and Nielsen 2000  The yeast S. cerevisiae is known to have a positive affect on growth and sporulation of P. roqueforti  Hansen and Jakobsen 2001; Hansen et al. 2001 . S. cerevisiae is also found to stimulate the release of free fatty acids  FFA  by P. roqueforti and a synergistic effect between P. roqueforti and S. cerevisiae has been demonstrated in the degradation of casein  Hansen and Jakobsen 2001; Hansen et al. 2001 . The positive interactions between P. roqueforti and S. cerevisiae were veriﬁed in a dairy trial. In the cheeses added S. cerevisiae improved growth and earlier sporulation of P. roqueforti was observed compared to the reference cheeses. Furthermore, positive contribution from S. cerevisae were also found in the aroma analysis, the degradation of casein, and by sensory analysis. The observed differences indicate the potential use of S. cerevisiae as an additional starter culture for production of Mycella  Hansen et al. 2001 .  In laboratory studies inhibition of P. roqueforti by Y. lipolytica, G. geotrichum and K. lactis have been observed. A negative effect of the yeast on the growth of P. roqueforti has not been veriﬁed in cheese, but should be kept in mind if the development of P. roqueforti is slow or absent. It should also be keep in mind that some of these yeast, e.g., D. hansenii and Y. lipolytica are known to produce reddish pigment on the cheese surface primarily from oxidation of tyrosine to melanin  Carreira et al. 1998; van den Tempel and Jakobsen 2000 .  4.6.3 Yeast in White Mold Cheese  White mold cheeses are semi-soft cheeses with growth of P. camemberti creating a white greyish mycelium on the surface on the cheese. The most famous variants are Brie and Camembert. In these cheeses pH is reduced to about 4.7 during the ﬁrst 24 hours by the primary lactic acid starter culture. P. camemberti metabolizes the lactate to water and CO2 resulting in an increasing pH, most pronounced on the surface of the cheese. A pH gradient of decreasing values will  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   be established towards the center of the cheese causing lactate to migrate towards the surface where it is used as a carbon source for P. camemberti. When all the lactate is depleted, casein will be degraded into amino acids and ammonia causing pH to increase further and the gradient to become stronger while the pH is still low in the center. The acid condition in the center causes soluble calcium phosphate to migrate towards the surface where it precipitates as a result of the higher pH  Karahadian and Linsa 1987; Vassel et al. 1986 . The establishment of the pH gradient caused by P. camemberti indirectly is the key factor in the maturation process  Lawrence et al. 1987 , but the desired soft texture of white mold cheeses is a direct result of the depletion of calcium phosphate in the center and the proteolytic activity of rennet, plasmin, and enzymes from the lactic acid bacteria and yeast. Yeast has been detected in several types of white mold cheeses and the positive role of yeast in the maturation and aroma formation of white mold cheese has been proposed  Schmidt and Lenoir 1980; Siewert 1986 . However, the exception rather than the rule in white mold cheeses. During ripening the yeast population increases to a level of 105 – 107 at the center and 106 – 108 at the surface. Several different yeast species have been isolated from white mold lactis, K. marxianus, and cheese and at G. geotrichum have been the dominant cultures while D. hansenii has been predominant in the center. S. cerevisiae and Zygosaccharomyces rouxii are also found, but less frequently  Baroiller and Schmidt 1990 . Except from G. geotrichum the role of yeast in the maturation process is still not clear, but it is assumed that their lipolytic and proteolytic activity and the capability to metabolize lactate and galactose, glucose and lactose play a role in the maturation. Further yeast have been mentioned to have an inhibitory effect on the undesired growth of Mucor spp. on the surface of Camembert cheese  Siewert 1986 .  the use of yeast as starter culture is still  the surface K.  a. The Role of Galactomyces Geothricum in White Mold Cheese. Galactomyces geotrichum is closely related to the production of white mold cheeses. G. geotrichum is often used as a co-culture together with P. camemberti in the production of white mold cheese  Addis et al. 2001; Molimard et al. 1995  and in a few variants of these cheeses G. geotrichum is used as the only culture. G. geotrichum is able to assimilate lactate and it grows faster on the surface of the cheese than P. camemberti. It seems to contribute strongly, along with different sulﬁdes, to the characteristic aroma proﬁle. Methanethiol and dimethyl is produced from methionine by two distinct pathways  Demerigny et al. 2000 . The formation of dimethyl disulﬁde, dimethyl trisulﬁde, and S-methyl thioesters are also well known for this yeast  Berger et al. 1999 . Further, G. geotrichum is able to produce volatile compounds like methylketones, alcohols, esters, and fatty acids  Jollivet et al. 1994 .  Some strains of G. geotrichum have anti-microbial activities. Production and excretion of 2-hydroxy-3-phenyl- propanoic acid, which have a broad anti-bacterial effect   Dieuleveux et al. 1998  and D-3-phenyllactic acids inhibiting Listeria monocytogenes  Dieuleveux et al. 1998  have been reported. G. geotrichum is known to inhibit contaminating molds on the surface of mold cheese and in studies where G. geotrichum was cultured together with P. commune, P. caseifulvum, P. verrucosum, P. solitum, and Aspergillus versicolor; it was found that mycotoxin were produced in signiﬁcantly lower concentration by the ﬁve molds compared to growth of the mold as single cultures  Nielsen et al. 1998a,b . All together, it indicates that G. geotrichum plays an important role in the inhibition of undesired micro- organisms in mold ripened cheese  Nielsen et al. 1998a,b . Many strains of G. geotrichum have been described and the diversity among the strains is very pronounced with regard to all their technological characteristics  Spinnler et al. 2001 .  4.6.4 Contribution and Spoilage of Yeast in Other  Types of Cheese  Besides the important role yeast play in surface-ripened and mold-ripened cheese, they may also have a desired inﬂuence on the maturation and ﬁnal quality of hard and semi-hard cheeses like Cheddar, Gouda, and Parmesan  Deiana et al. 1984; Viljoen and Greyling 1995 . Yeast are mentioned to accelerate the ripening process  Deiana et al. 1984 , but the role of yeast in these types of cheeses is not clear. A variety of yeast including, e.g., D. hansenii, Y. lipolytica, S. cerevisiae, K. marxianus, C. catanulata, T. delbruckii, and R. glutinis have been isolated from these types of cheese and seems primarily to be connected to spoilage, e.g., uncontrolled maturation, ﬂavor defects and blowing of the cheese, and undesired pigment formation. On the other hand, D. hansenii has been reported to have an inhibitory effect on the growth of Clostridium tyrobutyricum and C. butyricum, which is a well known spoilage organism in theses types of cheeses  Deiana et al. 1984; Fatichenti et al. 1983 .  In unripened cheese yeast only seems to cause spoilage. In cottage cheese, spoilage caused by, e.g., Y. lipolytica  C. lipolytica, Candidum sake, C. spherica, and K. maxianus has been reported  Brockelhurst and Lund 1985; Fleet 1990 . The spoilage appears as visible colonies on the surface of the cheese, ﬂavor and aroma defects and undesired production of gas  Brockelhurst and Lund 1985 .   Kaminarides  Several investigations have been reported on yeast in Feta cheese  Kaminarides and Laskos 1992; Tzanetakis et al. 1998; Vivier et al. 1994 . The dominant yeast in Greek Feta and the brine of Greek Feta is D. hansenii C. famata, S. cerevisiae, Torulaspora delbrueckii, Pichia farinosa, and Pichia membranaefaciens and Laskos 1992; Tzanetakis et al. 1998 . In Danish and Sardinian Feta, uncontrolled gas production by yeast caused swelling defects in the ﬁnal product  Fadda et al. 2001; Westall and Filtenborg 1998 . In Danish Feta with swelling defects Torulaspora delbrueckii was predominant while the responsible yeast in Sadinien Feta was found to be Dekkera anomala. Several other yeast species such as Y. lipolytica, D. hansenii, C. sake, K. marxianus, C. bututyri, and G. candidum, Dekkerar  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   bruxellensis, K. lactis were isolated from Feta cheese in these investigations. The yeast population in the Sardinian Feta was the same in the cheese from the two dairies investigated while the occurrence of yeast in Danish Feta seems to vary from dairy to dairy. The high concentration of yeast in the environment of the production area in the dairies indicated that the occurrence of yeast in these types of Feta was due to recontamination.  5 YEAST AS PROBIOTICS  i.e.,  According to the classical deﬁnition probiotic organisms regulate the microbial colonization in the digestive tract with a beneﬁcial effect on human health  Gedek 1991  In relation to current and future probiotic products this traditional deﬁnition seems to be too narrow  Jakobsen and Narvhus 1996 . The deﬁnition of a probiotic starter culture should be added a third-dimension, the extra nutritional – physiological values leading to a more general improvement of human health  Kurmann 1993; Lambelet et al. 1992 . As such, the role of yeast as probioticum in dairy products has been overlooked. Studies of probiotic yeast as starter culture in dairy product, so far, has been very limited even though yeast occur in many dairy-related products. Historically, yeast as a probioticum has been linked with livestock feed and to the genus Saccharomyces. As reviewed by Gedek  1991  S. boulardii is a nonpathogenic yeast and is used both as preventive and therapeutic agent for the treatment of different diarrhoeal diseases  McFarland and Bernasconi 1993; Surawicz et al. 1989 . S. boulardii was ﬁrst isolated in Indonesia in the 1950s. the taxonomical study “The Yeasts” edited by Kurtzman and Fell  1998 . S. boulardii is taxonomically classiﬁed under the name S. cerevisiae.  In the fourth edition of  Among few studies on the use of probiotic yeast in dairy products to be mentioned is that Lourens-Hattingh and Viljoen  2001  investigated the potential of adding S. boulardii to yoghurt. The result showed that S. boulardii was able to survive four weeks at 48C and even multiply to a level of about 106 in plain and fruit yoghurt. Gas and alcohol production were not observed, but it might be a constraint into retail bio-yoghurt  Lourens-Hattingh and Viljoen 2001 .  incorporating S. boulardii  for  Several speciﬁc interactions between S. cerevisiae and enteric pathogens, e.g., Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Shigella have been reported. Further, S. cerevisia is reported to bind enterotoxin from enterobacteria to the surface of the yeast through a mannose-speciﬁc reaction  Gedek 1991 . It has been reported that S. cerevisiae is able to survive the passage through the intestinal tract, with live cells detectable in the small intestine, which emphasize its potential as a probiotic.  Exploitation of killer factors as anti-microbial compounds could lead to another possibility for using yeast as probiotic. Killer toxins are proteins or glycoproteins secreted by the yeast cell and toxic to speciﬁc range of micro-organisms, e.g.,  enterobacteria  Brugier and Patte 1975; Polonelli and Morace 1986 . Many yeast also produces metabolites, e.g., short- chain fatty acids known to be toxic against undesired micro-organisms in the intestinal tract  Gedek 1991 .  Even though most yeast strains are considered to be safe, it is noteworthy that some strains found in dairy products, e.g., C. catenulata, G. geotrichum, and C. kefyr are seen as opportunistic pathogens  Radosavljevic et al. 1999 , and could represent a risk for human health especially for immunocompromised persons  Minervini et al. 2001; Radosavljevic et al. 1999 .  6 CONCLUSION  The present study has documented the positive as well as the negative aspects of yeast in the dairy industry, and the focus on yeast in dairy products seems to be more intensive than ever.  The negative role of yeast as spoilage organisms is still a problem and seen in all kind of dairy products. The most effective way to solve this problem is improvement of hygiene and sanitation, and tighter speciﬁcations for various ingredients, e.g., for yoghurt.  The technological characteristics of important yeast and the complexity of the microbiota of many dairy products have been discussed in several recent publications. Especially, the understanding of the positive role yeast play in maturation of surface-ripened cheese is increasing, but only to a very limited extent brought to the point of active use of yeast, i.e., the application of yeast as starter culture. New information on the technological characteristics of yeast and the diversity among strains of the same species is providing a better background for the selection and use of yeast as starter cultures in dairy products. The advantages of deliberate yeast addition to fermented and matured dairy products are evident. The advantages are mainly related to the proteolytic and lipolytic activity of yeast, their inﬂuence on aroma formation, and their acceleration of the ripening process. Further, yeast play an important role in microbial interactions resulting in improved performance of starter cultures and inhibition of undesired micro-organisms. Yeast also have probiotic properties.  The taxonomy for yeast is very complex. New methods, including molecular techniques are used increasingly, but for many of the yeast genera related to dairy products the molecular methods are not yet fully developed or sensitive enough to distinguish yeast strains at species or subspecies level. However, these techniques are a valuable supplement to the traditional methods of identiﬁcation and powerful tools in ecological studies including the microbiota from indigenous fermented dairy products and typing of starter cultures. New approaches for developing methods for typing yeast with potential as starter culture and characterization of yeast causing spoilage in dairy product should be given high priority in future research together with development of yeast starter cultures and the use of yeast as probiotics.

Fungal biotransformation of low- cost substrates to ﬂavor and aroma compounds having a high value appears to have great commercial potential. Such compounds have been accepted by the United States Drug Administration  USDA  and by the European Flavour Commission  88 388 EWG 1988; 91 71 EWa and 91 2 EWG 1991  as being natural and falling under the generally regarded as safe  GRAS  category  Janssens et al. 1992; Taylor and Mottram 1996 . The ﬂavor products obtained by microbial routes are optically pure, extra- cellular, and suitable for commercial exploitation because of easy down-stream processing and high yields. Extensive reviews on this subject have been published by Demyttenaere  2001 ; Hagedorn and Kaphammer  1994 ; Mestri  1997 . This chapter will deal with the description and discussion on fungal ﬂavors and aromas.   1994 ; and Van der Werf et al.  2 PRODUCTION OF MICROBIAL FLAVORS  Flavoring chemicals are produced either by biotrans- formation of precursor compounds to ﬂavour end-products, or by de novo synthesis. Fungi play an important role in this ﬁeld, as they can transform abundantly available substrates such as terpenes, and thereby make the process economical.  Terpenoids, constitute one of the largest groups of natural products and impart a wide variety of pleasant and ﬂoral scents. These compounds contain one, or more, basic isoprene units which are joined head to tail. Depending on the number of units, terpenes are classiﬁed as monoterpenes  2 units , sesquiterpenes  3 units , diterpenes  4 units , triterpenes  6 units , and polyterpenes  higher units . Terpenoids, produced from ﬁlamentous fungi are used by various food industries. Readily available monoterpenes, such as a-pinene and limonene, are used as substrates for conversion into ﬂavoring compounds  Berger et al. 1992; Van der Werf et al. 1997 .  2.1.1 Monoterpenes  a. Limonene Conversion. Limonene can be converted to major products like carveol and carvone by Penicillium italicum and P. digitatum  Bowen 1975 . When limonene concentration was increased there was a decrease in the quantity of end-products produced. Addition of sucrose increased microbial growth but the conversion was low. The conversion of limonene to carveol seems to be a single-step reaction, involving addition of a hydroxyl group at C-3  Figure 1 . Limonene biotransformation was ﬁrst carried out by Rama Devi and Bhattacharyya  1978  who studied the oxygenative and prototropic molecular rearrangements during terpene transformation by A. niger.  Abraham et al.  1985  investigated the biotransformation  of  R - þ   limonene to a-terpineol by P. digitatum. DSM  trans- 62840.

The biotransformation of a-pinene has con- siderable commercial importance. Hydroxylation of a-pinene by A. niger has been reported by several workers  Bhattacharyya et al. 1960 ; as also the references in their papers. Verbenol, verbenone, and sobrerol were obtained on biotransformation of a-pinene  Bhattacharyya et al. 1960 . Verbenone was probably a product of auto-oxidation, whereas verbenol was formed by microbial oxidation  Figure 2; Bhattacharyya and Ganapathy 1965 . Rama Devi and Bhattacharyya  1978  studied the conversion of a-pinene to 1-p-menthane, involving rupture of the cyclobutane ring in the bicyclic system.  Agrawal  1999  used an UV auxotroph of A. niger to increase the yield of verbenol from 10% obtained with a wild type to 25%. The enzyme a-pinene hydroxylase involved in a-pinene conversion to verbenol was NADPH dependent, and could be stabilized for 3 days using sorbitol along with DTT  Nazhat-ul-Ainn and Agrawal 2002 . No biotransformed products from a-pinene were found under nitrate reducing conditions  Pavlostathis and Misra 1999 . Optimization of growth conditions and media conditions can enhance the yield of verbenone  Agrawal and Joseph  2000a   from a-pinene using Penicillium sp. Major biotransformations of some terpene substrates to ﬂavoring compounds are given in Table 1.  2.1.2 Other Compounds  Many commercially important ﬂavouring constituents, like esters, lactones, aldehydes, ketones, tobacco ﬂavorings, and alcohols are produced with the help of fungi.  Figure 1 Biotransformation of limonene.  terpinolene to 1,2-trans-diols. They found that the inter- mediary epoxide could be cleaved by the hydroxyl groups present in the substrates. Noma et al.  1992  employed Aspergillus cellulosae to transform limonene to major products like carveol, perillyl alcohol, and a-terpineol. They reported the possibility of introducing an oxygen functional group into limonene at the C-3 position, utilizing citrus peel oil as C source. Demyttenaere et al.  2001  used a solid phase micro-extraction technique to study the conver- sion of limonene by P. digitatum, to obtain a-terpineol as the major product. For details refer to the review by Van der Werf et al.  1997 , which deals with terpene biotransformation, and  Figure 2 Biotransformation of pinenes.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

Ester. Various aliphatic esters could be obtained from lyophilized, whole cells of Rhizopus oryzae; such cells can tolerate high substrate concentrations, and hence allow the production of large amounts by semi-continuous or continuous addition of the substrate, e.g., geranyl butyrate  Molinari et al. 1995 . Lyophilized whole cells of R. Delemer were utilized to catalyze direct esteriﬁcation of primary alcohols  n-hexanol  to give a very high yield  98%  of hexyl caprylate  Molinari et al. 1998 . Agrawal et al.  2000  have demonstrated the production of dihydrocarvyl acetate from nerol, using Mucor sp. Although the metabolic pathway was not studied, it appears that ring closure through geranyl pyrophosphate led to the formation of dihydrocarvone, which may then be reduced to form dihydrocarveol and then acetylated to form dihydrocarvyl acetate. Regio-speciﬁc esters were obtained by using A. niger to form acetates of citronellol, geraniol, and linalool  Madhyastha 1988 . Patel et al.  1992  described a simple method of utilizing Geotrichum candidum to improve the optical purity of  S - 2  -4-chloro-3-hydroxy butanoic acid methyl ester by converting it to 4-chloro-3-oxobutanoic acid methyl ester. Cell extracts contained a single enzyme that catalyzed the reduction to the hydroxy product. Farbood et al.  1987  demonstrated the synthesis of terpene esters through an fragrans. Gatﬁeld  1988  amino acid precursor worked out the possibility of ester synthesis from lipase enzyme in Mucor michei; this process could improve upon the isolation and puriﬁcation steps, when compared to the aqueous fermentation systems.  in G.  d. Lactones, Aldehydes, and Ketones. Biogeneration of volatile lactones from fungi has proved to be industrially successful  Cardillo et al. 1990 . Lactone formation appears to be the result of a metabolic overﬂow. When the regular fatty acids is expanded to 4- or 3-hydroxylation of 5-hydroxylations, lactone formation takes place. These compounds impart fruit-like, buttery, sweet, or nutty odors.  Macrocyclic musks were produced from Ustilago zeae, using ustilagic acids as precursors  Gatﬁeld 1988 . Using octanoic acid, Gregory and Eilerman  1989  accomplished the bioconversion in Mucor sp. to delta-gamma octalactone. Farbood et al.  1990  obtained a mixture of saturated and unsaturated g-decalactones using g-keto acid as the substrate; the acid is reduced to g-hydroxy acid, which ultimately cyclizes to g-lactones. Serrano-Carreon et al.  1992  studied  the formation of g-d- and d-hydroxy acids in Trichoderma harzianum. Sporobolomyces odorus culture was able to produce an intense peach  g-decalactone  and mutton  cis-6- dodecen-4-olide  odors  Lee and Chou 1994 , P. roqueforti was employed for producing lactones, mainly 4-dodecanolide from hydrolyzed oils like soybean and copra  Chalier and Crouzet 1992 . The compound, 4-dodecanolide is formed by g-hydroxylation of the corresponding saturated acid, or by b-oxidation of oleic acid into 3-dodecanoic acid, followed by lactonization of the mentioned acids. The biosynthetic pathway in S. odorus, which results in the formation of 4-hexanolide as an oxidation product of linoleic acid, was studied by Taylor and Mottram 1996. It is possible that lactone is the result of b-oxidation of linoleic acid to 3,6-dodecadienoic acid, which is later hydrated and lactonized.  Production of 6-pentyl-a-pyrone by Trichoderma viride has been reported  Prapulla and Karanth 1992 . The addition of amberlite XAD-2 resin to the medium overcomes product inhibition. Kalyani et al.  2000  studied the formation of 6-pentyl-a-pyrone in surface cultures of T. harzianum, under submerged conditions. Characterization of 6-pentyl-a-pyrone also has been done using T. koningii  Benoni et al. 1990 .  Aldehydes are usually formed via a Strecker degradation of amino acids. This involves oxidative deamination and decarboxylation of a-amino acids, leading to the formation of an aldehyde containing one carbon atom less than the original amino acid  Mottram 1994 . Fungi have shown great potential in producing high yields of these ﬂavoring compounds. Among aldehydes, benzaldehyde  almond aroma  and vanillin, are widely used by food industries. Cis trans  Figure 3 Biotransformation of isoeugenol.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   isoeugenol  1:4  was converted by A. niger into vanillin  Figure 3; Robenhorst and Hopp 1991 .  Berger et al.  1987  studied the formation of a methoxy benzaldehyde in Ischnoderma benzoicum. Casey and Dobb  1992  reported the formation of aromatic aldehydes from aromatic amino acids, via a phenylpyruvic acid like benzaldehyde, using Trichosporon beiglii. Ketones are characterized by the presence of a carbonyl group, and are classiﬁed as aliphatic, aromatic, or phenol derivatives. They are synthesized by fungi in response to the presence of short- chain fatty acids, or as a means of recycling of COA. Mestri  1994  has discussed the production of nootkatone from valencene by an oxidation process involving P. camemberti and A. niger  Figure 4 .  Biotransformation of nerol, geraniol, and citral, in surface cultures of A. niger and P. digitatum, to 6-methyl-hept-5-en- 2-one  92 – 99%  has been studied by Demyttenaere and DePooter  1996  and Demyttenaere et al.  2000 . These workers indicated an oxidative pathway wherein the alcohol is oxidized to aldehyde, and then to 6-methyl-hept-5-en-2- one, with no intermediary products. The pathway of this biotransformation of geraniol into 6-methylhept-5-en-2-one by P. digitatum has been elucidated recently by Wolken and Van’ der Werf  2001 , who also point out that citral is converted into geranic acid in this process. Furthermore, they also detected a novel enzymatic activity, wherein citral lyase converts citral to methylheptenone and acetaldehyde, independently of cofactors.  e. Ionone. Tobacco ﬂavor is obtained by the transform- ation of ionone compounds. These compounds are widely distributed in nature, and are the constituents of many essential oils. Fungi, such as A. niger, converted ionone to a-cyclohomo-geraniol, 3-oxo-a-cyclohomo-geraniol, and benzofuran, as depicted in Figure 5  Krasnobajew and Helmlinger 1982 .  Figure 4 Biotransformation of valencene.  Larroche et al.  1995  have reported the formation of hydroxy and exo derivatives from b-ionone by A. niger. The recovery of the products was 100%, after 230 h of cultivation. This work paved the way for a possible fed-batch procedure, without replacement of the medium. When b-ionone was the only carbon source in the medium it stopped fungal growth, and was converted into hydroxy metabolites, probably by the action of a hydroxylase system. Grivel et al.  1999  made a dynamic model for biotransformation of b-ionone in A. niger. As the precursor is less soluble in water, it gave rise to a two- phase liquid system with high volatility and poor chemical stability. The products were 5,6-epoxy-5,6-dihydro-b-ionone, dihydro actinidiolide, and 4-oxo-b-ionone, with a molar yield of 32%; a high loss by stripping is a serious drawback of this process.  f. Acid Formation. The yields of acid produced by fungi are found to be commercially feasible, and are being utilized by industries. Armstrong et al.  1989  reported high yields of citric acid, which is perhaps the best known ﬂavor compound produced by A. niger. Fabritius et al.  1998  studied the conversion of palmitic acid to  R - Z -3- hydroxy-9-octadecendioic acid in Candida tropicalis; when ricinoleic acid was utilized as the sole carbon, optically pure  R - Z -7-hydroxy-9-octadecenedioic acid was obtained. As only one regio-isomer was obtained, the hydroxylation was regiospeciﬁc. Fatty acids are, therefore of great interest to the chemical industry, as they provide a new avenue for commercial exploitation.  g. Alcohols. Various alcohols, which are utilized widely as ﬂavors are produced by fungal conversions. The formation of sclareol, a labdoane diterpene used in foods, has been studied in C. albidus  Farbood et al. 1986 . Bioconversion of citronellol, leading to the formation of 2,6-dimethyl-1,8- octanediol and  E -2,6-dimethyl-2-octene-1,8-diol was stu- died with four strains of Botrytis cinerea in grape must  Brunerie et al. 1987 . The substrate was metabolized to the v-hydroxylation product  E -2,6 dimethyl-2-octene-1,8-diol and 2,6-dimethyl-1,8-octanediol. Regiospeciﬁc esters were produced by A. niger from acetates of citronellol, geraniol and, linalool  Madhyastha 1988 .The major product formed from citronellol acetate, was citronellol. Geraniol was produced from geranyl acetate while linallol and 8-hydroxy linalool were the major compounds from linalyl acetate. A bioreactor, based on an aqueous organic two-phase system, was designed by Doig et al.  1998  for the biotransformation of baker’s yeast to geraniol. Uzura et al.  2001 , using resting cells of Fusarium moniliforme, and propyl benzene as substrate, was able to form 1-phenylpropenol with high regio- and stereo-speciﬁcity. Lomascolo et al.  2001  worked out the possibility of producing 2-phenylethanol  rose ﬂavor  from A. niger, using as precursor phenyl alanine, which was synthesized as the sole aromatic product. Some examples of nonterpene fungal ﬂavoring compounds are given in Table 2.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   Figure 5 Biotransformation of ionone.  2.2 De Novo Synthesis  Unlike in the case of biotransformation, in de novo synthesis no speciﬁc precursors are needed in the medium. Products formed by using different micro-organisms include lactones, esters, and oxygenated terpenes  Table 3; Schindler and Schmid 1982; Scharpf et al. 1986 .  The fruity ﬂavor and aroma compounds produced by de novo synthesis depend on the media constituents like glucose, amino acids, and salts  Quehl and Ruttloff 1992 . In the de novo synthesis category most of the experiments carried out till now, were only on a laboratory scale, and the product yields were found to be low. However, they have helped in the study of the enzyme systems involved, and of their reaction pathways during the synthesis. Sarris and Latrasse  1985  demonstrated when Fusarium poae was grown on a solid malt medium till sporulation, it produced a lactone with a peach-like aroma; but under insufﬁcient aeration 2-methylbutanol and 3-methylbutanol were pro- duced. T. viride on a simple growth medium generated a  strong coconut aroma of 6-pentyl-2 pyrone  Welsh et al. 1989 .  Composition of the medium and age of culture generally inﬂuence the formation of ﬂavoring compounds in de novo synthesis. For instance, an intense banana aroma was formed by Ceratocystis ﬁmbriata when the growth medium was supplemented with several nutrients  Christen and Rainbault 1991 . Similarly, Lee et al.  1999  also reported formation of g-decalactone, in an optimized immobilized culture of Sporidiobolus salmonicolor.  2.3 Complex Flavors  Sharpell  1985  has discussed in detail some complex mixtures of ﬂavors and fragrances, which are associated with natural products. Microbial processes appear to be very promising for the production of complex dairy and mushroom like ﬂavors. Screening of different organisms made it possible  Table 2 Nonterpene fungal ﬂavoring constituents  Compound  Fungi  Products  References  Ester Lactones  Aldehyde  Acid Alcohol  R. delemer S. odorus T. viride I. benzoicum T. beigelii C. tropicalis B. cinerea A. niger  Aliphatic esters 4-Decalactone 6-Pentyl-a-pyrone Methoxy benzaldehyde Benzaldehyde 3-Hydroxydioic acid Octanediol 2-Phenylethanol  Molinari et al.  1998  Lee and Chou  1994  Prapulla and Karanth  1992  Berger et al.  1987  Casey and Dobb  1992  Fabritius et al.  1998  Brunerie et al.  1987  Lomascolo et al.  2001   Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

Kristofferson  1973  has studied the biogenesis of cheese ﬂavor. Maga  1974  investigated the formation of ﬂavor constituents by using Penicillium sp. on milk and bread. Similarly, formation of cheese ﬂavor, either by the enzymatic or route, has been studied by Law and Mulloholland  1991  who used fungal cultures.  the chemical  2.5 Mushroom Flavors  0  Sugihara and Humfeld  1954  who found that mushroom ﬂavor could be produced by Lepiota rhacodes when grown under submerged conditions. Gilbert  1960 ; Litchﬁeld et al.  1963 ; and Le Duy et al.  1974  studied the production of mushroom ﬂavor by Morchella crassipes. Lentinus edodes -amp, an intense mushroom ﬂavor produced 1-octen-3-ol, 5 when the medium was supplemented with ethanol  Sugimori et al. 1971 . Hamid et al.  1972  investigated the production from Trichoderma nudum under of mushroom ﬂavor submerged conditions, while Van Eybergen and Scheffers  1972  reported its production in the mycelium of Boletus edulis. Dijkstra  1976 , Pyssalo and Honkanen  1976 , and Card and Avisse  1977  the fermentation conditions as well as media constituents play a vital role in the production yield. Mushroom ﬂavors have also been obtained from A. oryzae  Scharpf et al. 1986 , Caprinus micaceus, Merulins rufus, and Poria vaillantu  Schindler and Schmid 1982 .  found that  Unilever Chemical Company UK; ethyl butyrate by Hercules, USA  Dziezak 1986 ; menthol by Nippon Mining Company, Japan  Watanabe and Inagaki 1978 ; and macrocyclic musk by Quest International  Jeffcoat and Willis 1988 .  4 CONCLUSIONS  In view of the increasing demand for natural ﬂavors, their production by microbial means seems to be a good preposition. The method is efﬁcient, effective, and also economical. Monoterpene substrates like limonene and alpha- pinene, which are produced in large quantities in nature, can be used for the production of ﬂavoring compounds of high value. The product yields obtained are high enough for industrial production, and many microbial processes are already operating. Newer genetic engineering techniques may still help in enhancing the product yield. There is also a need for metabolic pathways to be studied in detail so that high product yields can be obtained by its regulation. There is also need to investigate the effects of different parameters on a pilot plant scale which will lead to many more successful commercial technologies.

Liewen General Mills, Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA  1  INTRODUCTION  The problem of food spoilage has plagued humans throughout history. As early humans evolved from a gathering and hunting life style to raising crops and keeping animals, they were forced to store their own food. Early attempts to preserve foods involved use of sugars, spices, salts, and wood smoke. Today, however, preservation has used such factors as temperature, water activity, pH, gases, organic acids, salts, antibiotics, irradiation, packaging, and various combinations of these factors. No matter which factors are selected, use of the proper antimicrobial is dependant on the chemical properties of the antimicrobial; properties and composition of the food product; type of preservation system, other than the chemical, used in the food; type, characteristics, and number of microorganism; safety of the antimicrobial and cost effectiveness of the antimicrobial  Ray 2001 .  fungal growth. However,  Fungi are among the most challenging organisms to inhibit in foods given their ability to grow under a diverse range of environmental conditions. Environmental conditions such as water activity  aw , pH, temperature, and atmosphere can be manipulated to control these conditions often need to be taken to extremes to control fungi, since subgroups exist that have become adapted to extreme environmental conditions. Using water activity as an example, most molds are inhibited by an aw of 0.80 or lower, although some xerophilic molds can grow at aw values as low as 0.65. Most yeast are inhibited by aw values of 0.87, but some osmophilic yeasts can grow at aw values as low as 0.60  Farkas 1997; ICMSF 1980 .  Most fungi are little affected by pH over broad range, commonly 3 – 8. Some molds can grow at pH 2.0, and yeasts at pH 1.5  ICMSF 1980; Rahman and Labuza 1999 . However, as pH moves away from an organism’s optimum growth range, typically about 5.0 for fungi, the effect of other growth-limiting factors becomes more apparent.  Fungi are generally easily inactivated by heat treatments such as pasteurization, although some heat-resistant molds associated with fruits and fruit products can survive rather severe heat treatments and spoil products such as pasteurized juices and canned fruits. In addition, molds can grow over a wide range of temperature. Some mold can grow at temperatures less than 08C while other can grow at 50 – 558C. Molds have an absolute requirement for oxygen. Many species, however, are efﬁcient oxygen scavengers and can grow in atmospheres containing less that 1.0% O2  Cerny 1979 . From a practical standpoint, it can be difﬁcult to inhibit mold growth in foods solely by exclusion of oxygen from the package. Foods often contain dissolved oxygen, which slowly equilibrates with the package headspace, and oxygen can leach through all but the most impermeable packages. While mold growth can be delayed, it is not inhibited over long-term storage. Yeast have no requirement for oxygen and can grow in its complete absence.  Antifungal food additives are an efﬁcient, cost-effective, and often the only successful way to control fungal growth in foods. Antifungal food additives are basically chemicals that prevent or interfere with mold growth. These chemicals may be found naturally occurring in certain foods, such as some organic acids and essential oils, or may be added to food during processing  Naidiu 2000; Thompkin and Singh 2000 . The various antifungal food additives are brieﬂy overviewed in this chapter.  2 ORGANIC ACIDS  Organic acids have been used for years to control fungal spoilage of foods. They ﬁnd wide use because of solubility, taste, and low toxicity. The mode of action of organic acids is attributed to depression of intracellular pH by ionization of the undissociated acid molecule or disruption of substrate  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   transport, by alteration of cell membrane permeability. In addition to inhibiting substrate transport, organic acids may inhibit NADH oxidation, thus eliminating supplies of reducing agents to electron transport systems  Doors 1993; Liewen and Marth 1985 .  Since, the undissociated portion of the acid molecule is primarily responsible for antifungal activity, effectiveness is dependant upon the dissociation constant of the acid and pH of the food to be preserved. Because the dissociation constant of most organic acids is between pH 3 and 5, organic acids are generally most effective at low pH values. This along with solubility properties determines the foods in which organic acids may be effectively used.  A few fungal species possess mechanisms of resistance to organic acid preservatives. Saccharomyces baili is resistant to high concentrations of sorbic and benzoic acids  Warth 1977 . Some molds in the genus Penicillium can grow in the presence of high concentrations of sorbic acid and decarboxyated sorbic acid to 1,3-pentadiene, a volatile compound with an extremely strong kerosene-like odor  Liewen and Marth 1984; 1985; Tsai et al. 1988 . When resistance to or metabolism of an organic acid is a problem, other preservative systems must be used.  2.1 Sorbic Acid  Sorbic acid and its potassium salt are the most widely used forms of this compound and are collectively known as sorbates. The salt forms are highly soluble in water, as is true for all organic acids. Their most common use is preservation of food, animal feed, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical products, as well as technical preparations that come in contact with the human body. Methods of application include direct addition into the product; dipping, spraying, or dusting the product; or incorporation into the wrapper  Ranun 1999 .  Typical use levels in foods range for 0.02% in wine and dried fruits to 0.3% in some cheeses  Table 1 . Food in which sorbate has commercially useful antimicrobial activity  Table 1 Typical concentration  %  of sorbic acid used in various food products  Cheeses Beverages Cakes and pies Dried fruits Margarine Mayonaise Fermented vegetables Jams and jellies Fish Semimoist pet food Wine Fruit juice  0.2 – 3.0  0.03 – 0.10 0.05 – 0.10 0.02 – 0.05 0.05 – 0.10 0.10 0.05 – 0.20 0.05 0.03 – 0.15 0.1 – 0.30 0.02 – 0.20 0.05 – 0.20  include baked goods  cakes and cake mixes, pies and pie ﬁllings, doughnuts, baking mixes, fudges, and icing , dairy products  natural and processed cheese, cottage cheese, and sour cream , fruit product  artiﬁcially sweetened confections, dried fruit, fruit drinks, jams, jellies, and wine  vegetable products  olives, pickles, and relishes salads , and other miscellaneous products  certain ﬁsh and meat products, mayonnaise, margarine, and salad dressings   Sofos and Busta 1993 .  Environmental  type of microbial ﬂora,  factors such as pH, water activity, temperature, atmosphere, initial microbial load, and certain food components, singly or in combination can inﬂuence the activity of sorbate. Together with preservatives such as sorbic acid, they often act to broaden antimicrobial action or increase it synergistically. Use of other preservatives in combination with sorbate can broaden or intensify antimicrobial action. If growth of spoilage or pathogenic organisms is inhibited, but the microorganism is not killed, growth will eventually resume under proper conditions. The length of inhibition will vary with storage temperatures as well as with any of the other factors discussed.  little of  Sorbic acid is a broad-spectrum antimycotic that  is effective against yeast and molds. The antifungal effect of sorbate is greater at pH less than 5.0. Sorbic acid has little antifungal activity at pH values higher that 5.6. Above this pH, the acid is in the antimicrobially active dissociated form. However, sorbic acid has a relatively high dissociation constant compared to benzoic or propionic acids and is, therefore, usually the most effective of the organic acids at pH levels of 5.0 or higher. This is presented in Table 2  Luck and Jager 1997; Ray and Bullerman 1982 .  2.2 Benzoic Acid  Benzoic acid also has widespread use in the food industry. It occurs naturally in raspberries, cranberries, plums prunes, cinnamon, and cloves  Doors 1993 . As an antifungal food additives, the water-soluble sodium and potassium salts and the fat-soluble acid form are suitable for food and beverages with a pH below 4.5. Benzoates have little effect at neutral pH values. They are not as effective as sorbates at pH 5.0  Table 2 , but their effectiveness increases at lower pH values.  Table 2 Minimum concentration  %  of preservative required for inhibition of mold growth at pH 5.0  Compound  A. soini  P. citrinum  A. niger  Benzoic acid Propionic acid Sorbic acid  0.15 0.06 0.02  Species  0.20 0.08 0.08  0.20 0.08 0.08  Source: Liewen and Marth  1985 .

Benzoic acid is active against yeasts and molds, including aﬂatoxin-forming microorganisms  Ray and Bullerman 1982 . The acid form is often added to the fat phase and the sodium salt to the water phase of product such as salad dressings, mayonnaise, pickled vegetable, fruit products, and fruit drinks. Because benzoate can impart a fairly strong bitter off-ﬂavor, it is frequently used in combination with sorbate. This mixture is often more effective in inhibiting yeast and molds than a comparable level of either preservative alone  Luck and Jager 1997 . In addition, the mixture is less offensive organoleptically than benzoate alone.  2.3 Propionic Acid  This organic acid inhibits molds but not yeasts. It occurs in some foods as a result of natural processing. It is present in Swiss cheese at concentration up to 1%, where it is produced by the bacterium Propionibacterim shermanii  Beuchat 2000 . Since, yeast are typically unaffected, the acid can be added to bread dough without interfering with leavening  Ranun 1999 .  In the food industry, propionic acid is often used as a sodium or calcium salt  Ray 2001 . Propionates are used primarily to inhibit molds in bakery goods. In addition to their inhibit Bacillus antimycotic properties, propionates will mesntericus, the rope causing bacterium. Propionates are also used in a limited extent to inhibit mold growth in processed cheese.  The antifungal activity of propionic acid is weak compared to the other organic acids. Therefore, propionates must be used in relatively high concentrations to be effective. As with other organic acids, the pH value of the food to be preserved affects antimicrobial activity. Because of its low dissociation constant, propionic acid is active in a pH range similar to that of sorbic acid  Eckland 1990 .  2.4 Medium-Chain Fatty Acids  Generally, fatty acids are most effective as inhibitors of gram- positive bacteria and yeasts, although some fatty acids exhibit antimycotic activity. Chipley et al.  1981  observed that fatty acid derivatives reduced growth and aﬂatoxin production by Aspergillus spp.  Polyhydric alcohol fatty acid esters have great potential for use as emulsiﬁers in food formulations  Razani-Rohani and Grifﬁths 1994 . They also possess antifungal properties and, therefore, may exert a preservative effect in foods. Kato and Shibasaki  1975  demonstrated strong fungistatic activity of glycerol monocaprate and glycerol monolaurate toward Aspergillus niger, Penicillum citrinum, Candida utilis, and Saccharomyces cervisiae. Sucrose monocaparte and sucrose monolaurate were found to be slightly inhibitory to a spoilage ﬁlm-forming yeast inoculated into a soy sauce substrate  Kato 1981 . Six sucrose esters substituted to different degrees with a mixture of palmitic and stearic acids were examined by  Marshall and Bullerman  1986  for antifungal properties. Growth of Aspergillus, Penicillium, Cladosporium, and Alternaria spp. were inhibited in media containing 1% of the sucrose esters.  3 ANTIBIOTICS  3.1 Natamycin  Natamycin, formerly called pimaricin is an antibiotic that possesses strong antifungal properties, yet is not active against bacteria. Its use is currently allowed in several countries. Researchers have demonstrated that natamycin is active at very low concentrations against many of the fungi known to cause food spoilage. Levels of 10 ppm have been reported to be effective in Swiss cheese to control the growth of Penicillium citrinum while solutions of 1000 – 2000 ppm are effective as dips for cheese  Jay 1982; Pugazhenthi et al. 1999 . Natamycin inhibits aﬂatoxin formation by molds only when growth was completely inhibited  Ray and Bullerman 1982 .  3.2 Nisin  Nisin is active against gram-positive bacteria but has not been reported to be effective against yeasts and molds  Luchansky 1999 .  4 METABOLITES FROM LACTIC ACID  BACTERIA  fungi  in foods. However,  A wide variety of raw foods are preserved by lactic acid fermentation, including milk, meat, fruits, and vegetables. Reduction of pH and removal of large amount of carbohydrates by fermentation are the primary preservation actions that lactic acid bacteria  LAB  provide to a fermented food. These actions are largely ineffective in preventing the growth of it has also been recognized that LAB can produce inhibitory substances other than organic acid  acetate and acetate  that are antagonistic toward other microorganisms  Batish et al. 1997 . The antibacterial properties of LAB are well documented. Several LAB, typically of the genera Lactococcus and Lactobacillus produce antibacterial substances. Antifungal properties of LAB have received little attention, however, several metabolites of LAB have been reported to have antifungal activity.  Batish et al.   1989  screened different  lactic starter cultures for their antifungal activity with the goal of commercially exploiting their antifungal potentials. They found several strains of Streptococcus that inhibited a wide variety of molds. While the antifungal substances produced by the LAB were not identiﬁed of characterized, maximum production occurred at 308C and pH 6.8. Several speciﬁc LAB metabolites have been reported to have antifungal activity.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

Its antimicrobial action has been investigated by Jay who reported that a concentration of 200 ppm was inhibitory to yeast and 300 ppm was inhibitory to molds  Jay 1992 . Acidity of the growth medium was shown to have a direct effect on the antimicrobial activity of diacetyl. The compound was clearly more effective as an antifungal agent below 7.0 than above this value. Reasons for pH associated antifungal activity is not clear.  Since, effective concentration of diacetyl imparts a sharp odor of butter, potential for use in foods as an antifungal agent is limited. However, its use as a utensil sanitizer and in wash or rinse water for certain products is feasible.  4.2 Microgard  Microgard is grade A skim milk that has been fermented by Propionibacterium shermanii and then pasteurized  Hoover 2000 . The product prolongs the shelf life of cottage cheese by inhibiting psychotropic spoilage bacteria  Lyon et al. 1993 . The product is also antagonistic toward some yeast and molds. Microgard consists of proionic acid, diacetyl, acetic acid, and lactic acid  Al-Zoreky 1991 .  4.3 Reuterin  Reuterin is a low molecular weight nonproteinaceous, highly soluble, pH neutral metabolite produced by Lactoabacillus reuterii. The compound is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial with activity that encompasses yeast and molds as well as bacteria. It may have application in preservation of food by reducing populations of pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms  Daeshel and Penner 1992 .  5 HERBS AND SPICES  Herbs and spices are widely used to impart ﬂavor to foods. It is generally accepted that certain herbs and spices have antimicrobial activity and may inﬂuence the keeping quality of food to which they have been added. However, they are not currently used with the primary purpose of providing a preservative effect.  Hoffman and Evans  1911  were among the earliest to describe the preservative action of cinnamon, cloves, mustard, allspice, nutmeg, ginger, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. They found that cinnamon, cloves, and mustard were most effective and ginger, black pepper, and cayenne pepper were least effective.  Bachman  1982  studied the effect of spices and their essential oils on growth of several test organisms, including  Aspergillus and Penicillium species, and concluded that spices used in amounts as employed normally for ordinary food were insufﬁcient as preservatives. However, when used in larger amount, cinnamon, cloves, and all spices retarded mold growth. Bullerman  1974  reported that cinnamon in concentrations as low as 0.02% inhibited mold growth and aﬂatoxin production in culture media and cinnamon bread.  Combinations of different levels of potassium sorbate with cloves showed enhanced or possibly synergistic inhibitory effect on the growth of molds, indicating the possibility of using spices and commercial antifungal agents together in small amount to obtain antifungal activity  Azzouz and Bullerman 1982 .  In most  instances, herbs and spices are not effective antifungal agents when used in amounts normally added to foods. However, when used in combination with other preservative systems, they can be valuable contributors to an antifungal system consisting of interacting physical and chemical preservatives  Naidiu 2000 .  6 ESSENTIAL OILS  The antimicrobial activities of extracts from several types of plants and plant parts used as ﬂavoring agents in foods and beverages have been recognized for many years. Some of these essential oils have antifungal properties. Conner and Beuchat  1984  documented the effects of garlic and onion against yeasts and other investigators have shown these extracts to be inhibitory to molds. Alderman and Marth  1976  examined the effects of lemon and orange oils on Aspergillus ﬂavus and found when the citrus oils were added to grapefruit juice or glucose yeast extract medium at concentrations of 3000 – 3500 ppm, growth and aﬂatoxin production was suppressed. When orange oil was added to either medium at concentrations up to 7000 ppm, growth and aﬂatoxin production were greatly reduced although still evident. Recent publications have reported that the essential oils of anise, coriander, Roman chamomile, basil, and oregano were inhibitory to food and industrial yeasts  Chao et al. 2000; Elgayyar et al. 2001 .  7 PHENOLIC ACIDS  Phenolic antioxidants have been shown by several researchers to possess antifungal activity. Chang and Branen  1975  in a glucose salt medium, 1000 ppm demonstrated that butylated hydroxanisole  BHA  inhibited growth and aﬂatoxin production of Aspergillus parasticus spores, and . 250 ppm inhibited growth and aﬂatoxin production of A. parasiticus mycelia. However, they found that at 10 ppm of BHA, total aﬂatoxin production was more than twice that of the control, with virtually no effect on mycelial weight. These results indicate that at high levels, BHA may serve as an effective antifungal agent, however, at low levels BHA may actually stimulate aﬂatoxin production. The BHA has  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   been documented as inhibiting A. ﬂavus, A. parasiticus, Penicillium, Geotrichum, Byssochlamys species, and S. cerevisiae  Davidson and Naidu 2000 .  Since, the primary use of these compounds in foods is as antioxidants, their effectiveness as antifungal agents in food systems has not been adequately studied. While results of experiments in growth media indicate that these compounds exert antifungal effects, extrapolation of these resulting to food systems should be done with caution. Interaction of these compounds with food components will undoubtedly affect their antifungal properties.  8 GASES AND MODIFIED ATMOSPHERES  Elimination of oxygen is often used as a control measure for inhibiting the growth of molds. Exclusion of oxygen will not prevent growth of yeasts. Studies on bakery products have demonstrated that atmospheric O2 levels must be reduced to 0.1 – 1% to effectively inhibit growth of molds. In studies on toasted bread, Cerny  1979  demonstrated that visible mold would occur in 3 days in air; 5 days in 99% N2 – 1%O2; and . 100 days in 99.9% N2 – 0.1% O2, 99% CO2 – 1.0% O2, 99.8% CO2 – 0.2% O2, and 100% CO2. This study demonstrates that although molds are considered to be aerobic organisms, certain species have the ability to grow at very low levels of O2 concentrations. Effectively controlling mold by simple gas ﬂushing can be difﬁcult in practice. Chemical oxygen scavenger can be used in place of or to supplement gas ﬂushing  Farber 1991 . Oxygen scavengers will also give protection against package leaks and inﬁltrations of O2 through the package.  Carbon dioxide exerts antifungal action that supplements simple exclusion of O2 and, thus is more effective than inert gas such as nitrogen. The gas probably exerts antifungal activity by altering intracellular pH levels  Gorris 1994 .  Recent research has shown CO2 to have potential use with food. Carbon monoxide inhibits yeast and molds that causes postharvest decay in fruits and vegetables  Wagner and Moberg 1989 . The potential toxicity of this compound to workers requires special handling procedures.  Sulfur dioxide is broadly effective against yeasts and molds. It is used extensively to control growth of undesirable microorganism in fruits, fruit drinks, wines, sausages, fresh shrimp, and pickles. The antimicrobial activity of SO2 is associated with the unionized form of the molecule. Therefore, it is most effective at pH values , 4.0, where this form predominates  Weidzicha 2000 .  Ethylene oxide has been widely used to reduce microbial contamination and to kill insects in various dried foods. The gas has been used to treat gums, spice, dried fruits, corn, wheat, barley, dried egg, and gelatin  ICMSF 1980 . Concern over the toxicity of residues has limited the use of this gas in recent years.  Propylene oxide has been less studied than ethylene oxide. However, it appears that its antifungal effects are similar  Wagner and Moberg 1989 . Yeasts and molds are more  sensitive to the gas than bacteria. Propylene oxide has been used as a fumigant for control of microorganisms and insects in bulk quantities of goods such as cocoa, gums, processed spice, starch, and processed nutmeats  ICMSF 1980 .  Ozone  O3  is a strong antimicrobial agent with numerous applications in the food industry. It has been used for decades in many countries and was recently given GRAS status in the United States. Ozone in the aqueous or gaseous phase is active against a wide range of bacteria, molds, and yeasts. Most applications are targeted to decontamination of fruit and vegetable surfaces by washing in ozonated water  Xu 1999 . A second application is fruit and vegetable storage. Barth et al.  1995  assessed ozone exposure on storage of blackberries stored at 28C in air with 0.3 ppm ozone. Fungal development was suppressed while 20% of the control fruits showed decay. The effectiveness of ozone is inﬂuenced by the intrinsic factors of a food. It also oxidizes food surfaces when used at high levels. Further research may reduce some of these concerns so ozone can be used in broader food applications.  9  INTERACTION OF FACTORS  Many of the antifungal agents reviewed in this chapter need to be used at extreme concentrations or levels in a food to be effective when used alone. However, a variety of factors can prevent growth of fungi. While fungi tend to be more tolerant to adverse environmental conditions than bacteria, combining inhibitory factors such as temperature, water activity, or pH with antifungal agents can result in considerable improve- ment of the microbial stability of foods. Suitable combi- nations of growth-limiting factors at subinhibitory levels can be devised so that certain microorganisms can no longer proliferate.  Sorbic acid at 1000 ppm and pH 7.0 will not inhibit mold growth. However, if the pH is lowered to 5.0, growth of most molds will be inhibited  Liewen and Marth 1985 . Antioxidants such as BHA and BHT have been shown to potentiate the action of sorbic acid  Scott 1989 . In general, antifungal food additives become more effective as environmental conditions move away from the optimum for a particular organism.  factors are optimum.  The level of a single growth-limiting factor that will inhibit a microorganism is usually determined under conditions in which all other In preserving foods more that one factor is usually relied upon to control microbial growth. Addition of a substance, which in itself does not give full inhibition, can effectively preserve products in the presence of other subinhibitory factors. The effect of superimposing limiting factors is known as the “hurdles concept”  Leistner 1999 .  Little information is currently available on combining subinhibitory factors to preserve food. is very time consuming and expensive to design preservative systems using the hurdles concept by random design. Predicative modeling can be used to test the consequences of a number of factors changing at the same time. With proper design and  It  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   interpretation, preservative systems can be designed rapidly and efﬁciently  Whiting and Buchanan 1994 . However, product challenge studies should be conducted to verify the effectiveness of a combination of subinhibitory factors  Labuza and Taoukis 1992 .  10 CONCLUSIONS  Although antifungal food additives are, in general, the only successful way to control fungal growth in foods, they should never be used as a substitute for good manufacturing practices or proper sanitation procedures. Their proper use is as a processing aid. Obviously, antifungal food additive must be safe for human consumption, and their use is limited by law in most countries to relatively low levels and to speciﬁc foods. In addition, many of the traditional antifungal food additives are active only at high levels that adversely affect the taste of food and cannot be used commercially. However, with greater emphasis on the development and marketing of refrigerated foods by the food industry, some new preservation methods will become widely used and accepted.

Spoilage of foods and feeds is often the result of microbial activity from a variety of organisms. The microbial ﬂora that will develop depends very much on both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, modes of processing and preservation, and implicit parameters  Deak 1991; Van der Vossen and Hofstra 1996 . Yeasts and moulds can be found in a variety of environments because they can utilize a variety of substrates, and are relatively tolerant low temperature and preservatives. Consequently, although only a limited range of fungal species are responsible for the spoilage of a given food  Filtenborg et al. 1996 , contamination of foods and feeds by yeasts and moulds has been extensively reported  Huis in’t Veld 1996 . Fungi can contaminate foods and feeds at different stages including harvesting, processing and handling. Changes induced by spoilage of yeasts and moulds can be of a sensory nature, e.g., production of slime, pigmented growth, discoloration, rotting, development of off-odors and off-ﬂavors. The most important aspect of the formation of mycotoxins that may cause food poisonings. Although traditional morphological and physiological characters are fundamental parameters contributing to the identiﬁcation of microorganisms in foods and feeds, these criteria may be inﬂuenced by environmental conditions. To supplement classical methods, a number of nucleic acid-based methods have been developed in the past few years. These methods have the advantage over phenotypic methods of not being inﬂuenced by environmental conditions of the cells since the nucleotide sequence of DNA remains constant during growth. This review focuses on molecular methods developed for direct detection of fungi in different foods and feeds. First, we  food spoilage is, however,  will discuss two basic types of detection methods, those based on DNA hybridization, and those based on DNA ampliﬁca- tion. In the second part of the chapter, the possible nucleic acid targets of direct detection methods will be discussed.  2 METHODS USED FOR DETECTION OF  FUNGI  2.1 Hybridization-Based Methods  In its basic application, DNA or RNA is ﬁxed to a solid phase and a labeled probe is added and allowed to react with its complementary sequence  Southern 1975 . The direct hybridization techniques used for the detection of fungi include in situ hybridization and colony or dot blot hybridization methods  Geisen 1998; Sterﬂinger et al. 1998 . Besides DNA probes, peptide nucleic acid  PNA  probes have also been developed. Peptide nucleic acids are pseudopeptides in which the sugar phosphate backbone of DNA is replaced by a polyamide backbone. Due to the uncharged backbone, PNA probes have unique properties relative to oligonucleotides. These characteristics include faster hybridization kinetics, and the ability to form a stable PNA NA hybrid even at low ion concentrations, necessary to disrupt the secondary structure of nucleic acids such as rRNA  Perry-O’Keefe et al. 2001a,b; Stender et al. 2001 .  A recent development of hybridization-based techniques is the microarray technology. DNA microarrays are glass slides containing an ordered mosaic of the entire genome as a collection of either oligonucleotides  oligonucleotide micro- arrays  or PCR products representing individual genes  cDNA microarrays . The development of microarrays has been fuelled by the application of robotic technology to routine molecular biology. This technique allows a single hybridiz- ation to be performed against multiple replicates of a single  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   microbial genome, or against copies of several unrelated genomes on a single glass slide. Microarrays could be used to identify virulence genes as PCR products in food-borne bacteria  Chizhikov et al. 2001 . Similarly, they could also be used for fungi contaminating foods and feeds.  the direct detection of a variety of  Hybridization techniques have only rarely been used for direct detection of fungi in food matrices due to the lack of demanded sensitivity  Scheu et al. 1998 . Kosse et al.  1997  developed 18 S rDNA-based probes for the detection of yogurt spoilage yeasts, while Geisen  1998  developed suitable probes for the detection of fumonisin producing Fusarium species based on randomly selected sequences. Chemiluminescent DNA probe kits are available for the detection of some medically important including Blastomyces dermatitidis, Histoplasma capsulatum, Cocci- dioides immitis, and Cryptococcus neoformans  GenProbe, San Diego, USA . However, to our knowledge, such kits have not yet been developed for food-borne fungi.  fungi  2.2 Ampliﬁcation-Based Methods  the different  Sensitivity of detection can be greatly improved through the in vitro ampliﬁcation methods use of [polymerase chain reaction  PCR , ligase chain reaction or self-sustained sequence replication, nucleic acid sequence- based ampliﬁcation  NASBA ]. With the exception of PCR the above-mentioned in vitro ampliﬁcation and NASBA, methods have had only limited practical relevance in food monitoring  e.g., Stubbs et al. 1994 .  2.2.1 Polymerase Chain Reaction  Since its discovery, a considerable number of PCR-based assays have been developed, but they have been applied most often to clinical and environmental samples and more rarely for the detection of food-borne microorganisms. The PCR technique allows rapid and selective identiﬁcation and or detection of microorganisms in different matrices by amplifying speciﬁc gene fragments. The reaction cycle consists of three steps:  a  denaturation of the double-stranded DNA  dsDNA ,  b  annealing of short DNA fragments  primers  to single DNA strands, and  c  extension of the primers with a thermostable DNA polymerase. Following the completion of one cycle, the sample is denatured for the next annealing and extension steps during which not only the original target region is ampliﬁed, but also the ampliﬁcation product of the ﬁrst cycle, leading to an exponential increase of the number of copies of the target DNA. The detection of ampliﬁcation products is possible through gel electrophoresis, ethidium bromide staining and visual examination of the gel using ultraviolet light. To increase the sensitivity and to conﬁrm the identity of the ampliﬁcation product, Southern blotting and hybridization with a speciﬁc probe can also be carried out  Hendolin et al. 2000; Lo¨fﬂer et al. 2000; Sandhu et al. 1995 . Attempts have been made to increase the  speciﬁcity of PCR reactions using other methods, including post-PCR hybridization  Sandhu et al. 1995 , PCR-ELISA  enzyme linked immunosorbent assay  or ELOSA  enzyme linked oligosorbent assay  reactions  Grimm and Geisen 1998; Schnerr et al. 2001 , RFLP  restriction fragment length polymorphism  analysis of the PCR products  Yamagishi et al. 1999 , denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis  DGGE, Cocolin et al. 2001 , ﬂuorescent capillary electrophoresis  Turenne et al. 1999 , or nested PCR, where one set of primers is used to amplify DNA fragments from target DNA, and a second set of primers complementary to an internal sequence of the product of the ﬁrst PCR reaction is used to score and conﬁrm the results  Ibeas 1997 . In case of closely related species, single nucleotide differences can be visualized by using single strand conformation polymorphism  SSCP  analysis  Kumeda and Asao 1996 , heteroduplex mobility assay  Olicio et al. 1999 , heteroduplex panel analysis  Kumeda and Asao 2001 , or by sequence analysis  Cappa and Cocconcelli 2001 .  2.2.2 Nucleic Acid Sequence-Based Ampliﬁcation  An alternative to PCR analysis, NASBA has also been applied to detect fungi  Lo¨fﬂer et al. 2001; Widjojoatmodjo et al. 1999 . The NASBA is an isothermal nucleic acid ampliﬁ- cation technology that speciﬁcally ampliﬁes RNA sequences using T7 RNA polymerase  Compton 1991 . Major advantages of NASBA over PCR is that it is performed isothermally at 418C, no separate reverse transcription step is required for RNA ampliﬁcation, and since RNA is less stable than DNA – provides a better estimate of living cells in the sample analyzed.  2.2.3 Quantiﬁcation of Results  Besides qualitative detection of spoilage microbes, it is also often desirable to know their abundance in foods and feeds. Quantiﬁcation of the PCR results can be carried out by different approaches including limiting dilution of the DNA samples, densitometric measurement of PCR products, by HPLC with a UV detector  Katz 1996 , by quantitative competitive PCR  QC-PCR , or by real-time PCR  Cross 1995 . Two of them, QC-PCR and real-time PCR are the most promising tools for quantifying fungi in foods and feeds.  The QC-PCR using internal DNA standard provide the means for determining relative amounts of target DNA. The principle of QC-PCR is the coampliﬁcation of standard DNA together with target DNA. The competitor DNA is of known sequence  typically identical with the target DNA with added deletions or insertions  and has the same primer binding sites as the target DNA  Baek and Kenerley 1998; Haugland et al. 1999 .  During conventional PCR, an endpoint analysis is carried out by examining the ﬂuorescence of ethidium bromide stained ampliﬁcation products separated by gel electro- phoresis. With real-time PCR, the continuous analysis of ampliﬁcation-associated ﬂuorescence during the whole PCR  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   0  0  reaction gives a graphic display of the time course of ampliﬁcation of the PCR product of interest. Both direct and indirect methods are used for generating the ﬂuorescence monitored during the PCR cycle  Walker 2001 and references therein; Figure 1 . Indirect assays employ a system that yields ﬂuorescence generated during the process of primer extension during ampliﬁcation. This is employed in the Taqman system. nuclease activity of Taq Taqman probes utilize the intrinsic 5 DNA polymerase to digest a probe that has annealed to the speciﬁc gene of interest. The probe consists of quencher and reporter ﬂuorochromes separated by a speciﬁc DNA nuclease sequence. Taq DNA polymerase-associated 5 digestion of the probe results in degradation of the probe and separation of the ﬂuorochromes, so loss of quenching results in ampliﬁcation-associated production of ﬂuorescence. Direct methods refer to those systems in which ﬂuorescence is a direct result of some binding of a ﬂuorescence molecule to the ampliﬁed product or a direct incorporation of a ﬂuorescence interference probe into the ampliﬁed product. A simple direct method involves the use of a ﬂuorescent dye such as SYBR Green. This dye possesses selective afﬁnity to dsDNA. Binding of the dye to dsDNA enhances ﬂuorescence at 530 nm proportionally with dsDNA concentration. Speciﬁc hybridization probes can also be used that ﬂuoresce only when bound to the gene of interest. All these probes are based on ﬂuorescent resonance energy transfer  FRET; Walker 2001 . Molecular beacons are essentially hairpin probes that employ ﬂuorescence interference  Figure 1 . A variation on  the hairpin probe concept has been employed to develop unimolecular probe systems such as the Sunset or Scorpion primers, which are incorporated into the ampliﬁed sequence during the PCR reaction. A variety of PNA-based probes have also been developed for real-time PCR applications  Stender et al. 2002 .  The LightCycler hybridization probe system consists of a labeled donor and acceptor probe. Fluorescence from the acceptor will only be generated when both probes are annealed to the product  Figure 1 . The level of ﬂuorescence is proportional to the amount of DNA generated during the PCR reaction  Lo¨fﬂer et al. 2000 . The PCR reaction can be carried out in small volumes in a glass capillary that speeds up the heating process. The LightCycler technology combines rapid in vitro ampliﬁcation in glass capillaries with real-time determination and quantiﬁcation of DNA, enabling a 35 cycle PCR with 32 samples to be completed in 45 min.  2.2.4 Limits of PCR  One of the main drawbacks of PCR-based detection methods is that besides living cells, dead cells with relatively intact DNA are also detected, thus leading to false positive results. This limitation can be circumvented by including a propagation step prior to PCR analysis, or by using RNA as template in reverse transcription coupled with PCR, or NASBA reactions  Vaitilingom et al. 1998; Widjojoatmodjo et al. 1999 . Although the detection of dead cells is a  Figure 1 Fluorescence systems used in real-time PCR systems. S, SYBR Green; R, reporter ﬂuorochrome; Q, quencher ﬂuorochrome.

Mycotoxins are stable molecules, and detection of the producing fungi in a sample could be used as prediction for the presence of mycotoxins.  Much of the difﬁculty in implementing PCR for the analysis of food samples lies in the problems encountered during the preparation of template DNAs from food matrices. The DNA extraction method used must achieve two aims: efﬁciently purify fungal DNA with minimal loss, and remove compounds inhibiting the PCR reaction. Foods are complex matrices and may contain several compounds that interfere with the PCR reaction leading to false negative results. These compounds include nucleases, chelating agents, or inhibitors of the polymerase itself. Cheese was found to be an extremely problematic matrix  Scheu et al. 1998 . Several attempts have been made to develop a DNA extraction protocol to remove inhibitors from the samples  Dickinson et al. 1995; Lantz et al. 1999; Rossen et al. 1991; Rossen et al. 1992 . The use of additional reagents during DNA extraction was suggested by different authors  e.g., DNA binding agents such as hexadecyl-trimethylammonium bromide, or polyvinyl pyrro- lidon for elimination of polyphenols . Additionally, DNA samples can be further puriﬁed by dialysis, gel ﬁltration, or by other chromatographic methods. Besides careful extraction, other methods have also been suggested, including extensive dilution of the contaminating substances, or application of internal standard DNA in the PCR reaction  Geisen 1998 . Separation of the microbes from the food matrix can be carried out by subculturing, or by using magnetic beads coated with speciﬁc binding proteins  lectins, antibodies; Patel et al. 1993 .  including genes of  regions the rRNA gene cluster are targeted. Other targets the ergosterol could also be used, biosynthesis  Morace et al. 1997 , translation elongation factor genes  Vaitilingom et al. 1998 , and the chitin synthase gene  Jordan 1994 . For speciﬁc detection of a single genus or species, more variable regions of the genome, e.g., spacer regions of the rRNA gene cluster, or sequence characterized ampliﬁed region  SCAR  markers should be targeted. For the detection of mycotoxin producing fungi, sequences of the mycotoxin biosynthetic genes are the best targets. In the following, the targets used for molecular detection of fungi are dealt with, with special emphasis on mycotoxin producing fungi.  3.1 Targets Based on the Ribosomal RNA Gene  Cluster  The ribosomal RNA gene cluster occurs in fungi as tandem repeats of a structured unit comprising three ribosomal RNA subunit genes, internal transcribes spacers  ITS  and intergenic spacers  IGS   Figure 2 . The DNA sequences within the subunits in general contain some extremely conserved sequences useful for the development of broad- spectrum primers that allow ampliﬁcation of fungal sequences from mixed DNA samples. The resulting fragments can be further fractionated to obtain species or genus speciﬁc proﬁles by other techniques, e.g., nested PCR, SSCP, hybridization, ELOSA, RFLP analysis, or sequencing. The more variable spacer regions can be used for genus- or species-speciﬁc detection approaches.  3 MOLECULAR TARGETS USED FOR THE  DETECTION OF FUNGI  The choice of molecular target depends on the aim wished to be achieved. For panfungal detection, usually the conserved  3.1.1  18 S rRNA Gene As Target  There are several reports where 18S rDNA sequences have been used for the detection and identiﬁcation of fungi. Kappe et al.  1996 , Smit et al.  1999 , and Borneman and Hartin  2000  developed primer pairs based on this region for the  Figure 2 Organization of the ribosomal RNA gene cluster in ﬁlamentous fungi. ETS, external transcribed spacer; NTS, nontranscribed spacer; IGS, intergenic spacer; ITS1 and ITS2, internal transcribed spacer regions.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   detection of a wide range of fungi. Mayer  2002  also developed a primer pair and a Taqman probe based on 18 S rDNA sequences, which was used successfully for real-time PCR detection of fungi in black pepper, red pepper, corn, and cereal samples. Makimura et al.  1994  developed a PCR detection system based on 18S rDNA sequences for detection of Aspergillus and Penicillium species. Cappa and Cocconcelli  2001  developed an 18 S rRNA-based assay for the detection of fungi in food samples.  3.1.2  28 S rRNA Gene As Target  Although the DNA coding for the large  28S  ribosomal rRNA subunit is relatively conserved and is more commonly used for work at higher taxonomic levels, certain portions of it, particularly the eukaryotic D1 and D2 divergent domains 0 end are variable enough to detect species-speciﬁc near the 5 differences. The D1 – D2 region has extensively been used for phylogenetic studies of aspergilli, penicillia, and yeasts as well as other fungi  Peterson 2000; Rigo´ et al. 2001 . Universal 28S rDNA-based primers were developed by Sandhu et al.  1995 . These authors used species-speciﬁc probes in post-PCR hybridization reactions to detect the presence of fungi of interest even in situations containing mixed fungal species.  3.1.3 The ITS Region As Target  The ITS region has been most frequently used as target for species-speciﬁc detection of fungi in foods and feeds. This region was targeted for the detection of spoilage yeasts including Zygosaccharomyces sp. and Torulaspora delbrueckii  Sancho et al. 2000 , Saccharomyces cerevisiae  Arlorio et al. 1999 , Alternaria sp.  Zur et al. 1999 , Penicillia  Pedersen et al. 1997; Boysen et al. 2000 , and Fusarium avenaceum  Schilling 1995 . Olsson  2000  applied a QC-PCR approach using ITS-based primers for the detection of Penicillium species including Penicillium roquefortii in cereals. Grimm and Geisen  1998  developed ITS-based primer pairs for fumonisin producing Fusarium species. The sensitivity of the assay was increased using PCR-ELISA. Hendolin et al.  2000  developed a panfungal PCR technique coupled with multiplex liquid hybridization based on ITS speciﬁc primers for the detection of a number of fungi in clinical specimens.  the detection of  3.1.4 Other rDNA Regions Used As Targets  Although the ITS region allows for discrimination of closely- related species, it may not be sufﬁciently variable to distinguish sibling biological species or isolates. The intergenic spacer region of the nuclear rDNA  IGS  however, has been used for species determination when ITS regions lacked sufﬁcient variation  Spreadbury et al. 1993 . Ribosomal RNAs are also encoded in the mitochondria and have been used for molecular identiﬁcation  Wakeﬁeld et al. 1990 . Fulton and Brown  1997  developed a primer pair  based on sequences of an intron located within the 18 S rRNA gene for the detection of Monilinia fructicola. Montone and Litzky  1995  targeted the 5 S rRNA gene for the detection of different Aspergillus species.  3.2 Mycotoxin Biosynthetic Genes As Targets for  Detection of Fungi  fungal Mycotoxins are a chemically diverse group of secondary metabolites that are harmful to animals and humans. Several hundreds of different mycotoxins have been identiﬁed, but only about 20 of them are relevant to human health. Most of the mycotoxin-producing species are ﬁlamentous ascomycetes or deuteromycetes, Aspergillus, Fusarium and Penicillium are considered as being the most important mycotoxin-producing genera. Most mycotoxins are very resistant to physical or chemical treatments. Although well-documented cases of mycotoxicoses are rare, the constant uptake of small amounts of mycotoxins, especially those with carcinogenic activity, can have profound effects on human health. Apart from the use of speciﬁc rDNA gene- based or RAPD-based probes, mycotoxin biosynthetic genes can serve as ideal targets for the detection of the producing fungi. To date, a number of biosynthetic genes of mycotoxins have been isolated and characterized. These gene sequences could serve as targets for molecular detection of the producing fungi as detailed below.  3.2.1 Aﬂatoxins  Aﬂatoxins  ATs  are among the most carcinogenic naturally occurring compounds known. Aﬂatoxins are produced mainly by species of Aspergillus section Flavi, e.g., by A. ﬂavus, A. parasiticus, A. nomius, and A. bombycis. Sterigmatocystin, an intermediate of AT biosynthesis is also produced by other fungal species including, e.g., Aspergillus nidulans and A. versicolor. A. ﬂavus and A. parasiticus are closely related to the nonaﬂatoxigenic A. oryzae and A. sojae species, respectively, which are used in food industry for producing soy sauce and frequently applied as hosts for the expression of heterologous proteins. Since these species are both morphologically and physiologically very similar to the AT-producing species, molecular methods have been extensively surveyed for the differentiation of these species, and AT-producing and nonproducing A. ﬂavus isolates.  The biosynthetic pathway leading to AT production is one of the best known secondary metabolite pathways in fungi  Brown et al. 1996; 1999 . Criseo et al.  2001 , Fa¨rber et al.  1997 , Geisen  1996; 1998 , and Shapira et al.  1996  applied multiplex PCR targeting 3 – 4 genes of the gene cluster to identify AT-producing fungi. Bagnara et al.  2000  applied the real-time PCR system for the detection of an AT producing A. ﬂavus isolate in black pepper. Mayer et al.  2003  developed a Taqman probe based on sequences of the norsolorinic acid reductase  nor-1  gene for quantitative detection of AT-producing fungi in foods including black  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   pepper, red pepper, corn, and cereals. All authors found that some nonaﬂatoxigenic isolates gave false positive results. Even the AT nonproducing A. sojae and A. oryzae isolates were found to carry AT biosynthetic genes  Kusumoto et al. 2000; Matsushima et al. 2001 . However, mRNA of the aﬂR, the regulatory gene of AT biosynthesis was not observed in A. sojae  Matsushima et al. 2001 . These results indicate that a  multiplex  RT-PCR technique developed by Sweeney et al.  2000  for monitoring AT production in A. parasiticus could be used more efﬁciently for detection of AT producing fungi. Mayer et al.  2001  used Taqman-based real-time PCR for monitoring the expression of the nor-1 gene providing a possible mRNA-based method for the detection of AT-producing fungi in foods and feeds.  3.2.2 Trichothecenes  Trichothecenes are sesquiterpenoid mycotoxins produced by several fungal genera including Fusarium, Trichothecium, Acremonium, Gliocladium, Myrothecium, Trichoderma and Stachybotrys. More than 30 structurally related tetracyclic trichothecenes are known, among which T-2 toxin, diacetoxyscirpenol, deoxynivalenol, and nivalenol are economically the most important mycotoxins. The main producers of these toxins are in the genus Fusarium  e.g., F. acuminatum, F. culmorum, F. graminearum, F. poae, F. solani, and F. sporotrichioides . Trichothecenes have dermatotoxic, cytotoxic, and phytotoxic properties, and have been suggested to play a role in plant pathogenesis as virulence factors. Trichothecene biosynthesis genes were found to comprise a 25 kbp gene cluster including at least 10 genes in F. sporotrichioides and F. graminearum  Brown et al. 2001; Hohn et al. 1993 . Similar clustering of the trichothecene biosynthesis genes was found in Myrothecium roridum, which produces macrocyclic trichothecenes  Trapp et al. 1998 .  Fekete et al.  1997  determined the sequence of the Tri5 gene of Fusarium poae, and used a 378 bp fragment of it as a hybridization probe to detect similar sequences by dot blot hybridization in other fungi. Strong hybridization was observed to trichothecene producing Fusarium, Myrothecium and Stachybotrys species, but not to Trichoderma and Trichothecium DNAs. Niessen and Vogel  1998  developed a PCR method based on the ampliﬁcation of Tri5 sequences for the detection of trichothecene producing Fusarium species in wheat samples. The authors also applied the LightCycler system with Sybr Green I for quantitation of their results. For distinguishing nonspeciﬁc products such as primer dimers, melting point analysis was carried out  Schnerr et al. 2001 . Tri5 gene sequences were chosen as targets too in a quantitative competitive PCR approach developed for the detection and quantiﬁcation of trichothecene producing fusaria in cereals by Edwards et al.  2001 , and by Birzele et al.  2000 . Doohan et al.  1999  developed a reverse- transcription-based PCR assay to quantify the expression of the Tri5 gene in Fusarium species. Lee et al.  2001  developed primer pairs based on sequences of the Tri7  gene for distinguishing between deoxynivalenol and nivalenol producing isolates of Gibberella zeae  Fusarium graminearum .  3.2.3 Patulin  Patulin is an unsaturated lactone produced by a number of Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Byssochlamys  Paecilomyces  species. Representatives of other fungal genera, such as Mucor, Mortierella, Alternaria, Chrysosporium, Fusarium, and Trichoderma were also found to produce this mycotoxin  Steiman et al. 1989 . The economically most important producer of patulin is Penicillium expansum, the causative agent of soft rot of apples and other pomaceous fruits. Patulin is receiving worldwide attention because of its occurrence in unfermented apple juice. The biosynthesis of patulin is well known  Paterson et al. 2000 . Two genes of the biosynthetic pathway, the polyketide synthase gene, and an iso-epoxydon dehydrogenase  IDH  gene have been cloned and character- ized to date  Beck et al. 1990; Wang et al. 1991; Gaucher GM, and Fedeschko RW, unpublished results . The IDH gene product catalyzes the epoxydon – phyllostine oxidation step of patulin biosynthesis  Sekiguchi and Gaucher 1979 . Recently, a primer pair speciﬁc for the IDH gene  GenBank accession number AF006680  has been developed and used successfully to detect patulin-producing abilities of penicillia  Paterson et al. 2000 . Patulin production of Aspergillus species was also analyzed using analytical procedures  thin layer chromatography and HPLC , agar diffusion test, and a PCR-based approach using the primer pair developed for the detection of the IDH gene  Varga et al. 2003 . The analytical-, biological-, and PCR-based approaches used for patulin detection gave highly similar results indicating that the primers developed for a Penicillium IDH gene could also be used to detect patulin producing aspergilli in natural substrates. A quantitative PCR approach is also being tested for the detection of patulin producing organisms in foods including apple products and malt.  3.2.4 Other Mycotoxin Biosynthetic Genes  The PR-toxin is a sesquiterpenoid mycotoxin produced by P. roqueforti strains isolated from cheese and silage  Geisen 1998 . This mycotoxin has been implicated in incidences of mycotoxicoses resulting from the consumption of contami- nated grains  Proctor and Hohn 1993 . The gene sequence of aristolochene synthase  a sesquiterpene cyclase , the key enzyme of PR-toxin biosynthesis is known  Proctor and Hohn 1993 . Geisen  1998  developed a primer pair based on the sequence of aristolochene synthase, which was used successfully for the detection of PR-toxin producing fungi in cereals and cheese.  The ergot alkaloids are produced mainly by Claviceps purpurea and some other Claviceps species  e.g., C. paspali, C. fusiformis , although other species, e.g., Aspergillus fumigatus, A. clavatus, Penicillium species, and plants have also been described as producers of these mycotoxins. Since  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   Claviceps strains parasitize not only cereals but also different kinds of grasses, ergot poisoning of grazing animals is still an economic problem. Sequences of some of the biosynthetic genes responsible for ergot alkaloid production are known  Tudzynski et al. 1999 . Boichenko et al.  2001  developed a primer pair based on sequences of 4- g,g-dimethylallyl - tryptophane  DMAT  synthase, the key enzyme of the ergot alkaloid biosynthesis, and used successfully in PCR reactions to detect ergot alkaloid producing fungi.  Fumonisin B1 was discovered in 1988 in Fusarium moniliforme  F. verticillioides  isolates. Fumonisins are most frequently encountered from stored corn and other cereals, and are the causal agents of leucoencephalomalacia, a fatal brain disease of horses, pulmonary edema in pigs and suspected to be responsible for high incidences of esophageal cancer in South Africa and China. Fumonisins are synthesized through the polyketide biosynthetic route. Seo et al.  2001  identiﬁed four coregulated genes associated with fumonisin production in F. verticillioides. These data indicate that these gene sequences could be used for the development of gene probes for the identiﬁcation of potential fumonisin producing species in foods and feed products.  the occurrence of  Since biosynthetic genes of other mycotoxins, e.g., those of fumonisins  Proctor et al. 1999; Seo et al. 2001  and the tremorgenic mycotoxin paxilline  Young et al. 2001  have also been characterized, molecular detection methods can potentially be applied in these cases as well. Apart from the mycotoxins mentioned earlier, the nephrotoxic ochratoxins in cereals, coffee beans, and other agricultural commodities also poses serious hazard to human and animal health  Varga et al. 2001a,b . Experiments are in progress in some European laboratories to isolate and characterize genes responsible for ochratoxin biosynthesis in Penicillium and Aspergillus species, and to identify suitable molecular probes for the detection of ochratoxin- producing fungi in foods and feeds  Quality of life and management of living resources project number QLK1-CT- 1999-00433: Prevention of ochratoxin A in cereals; QLK1- toxigenic Fusarium CT-1999-01380: Early detection of species and ochratoxigenic fungi in plant products .  3.3 Other Sequences As Targets  One approach used for developing suitable species- or strain- speciﬁc probes for the detection of fungi is based on the random ampliﬁed polymorphic DNA technique  RAPD   Williams et al. 1990 . The RAPD is a variation of conventional PCR where one primer of arbitrary sequence is used, and the annealing temperature is low  usually 358C . Species- or strain-speciﬁc RAPD fragments are selected, sequenced, and suitable primers are devised to amplify the speciﬁc fragment in conventional PCR reactions. Such SCAR markers have been successfully used to develop species- for a number of Fusarium species speciﬁc probes  Chelkowski et al. 1999; Nicholson et al. 1996; Nicholson et al. 1998; Schilling et al. 1996; Young et al. 2001 ,  particularly fumonisin-producing fusaria  Geisen 1998 , and for Aspergillus fumigatus  Brandt et al. 1998; Varga et al. 2002, unpublished results . Murillo et al.  1998  developed a primer pair based on the sequence of a random genomic clone for the detection of Fusarium moniliforme.  For the detection of Fusarium graminearum, another target, the galactose oxidase  gaoA  gene has been used  Niessen and Vogel 1997 . This enzyme is produced by only a limited number of fungi including F. graminearum, Gibberella fujikuroi, and Beltraniella portoricensis. Niessen et al.  1998  also developed a solid phase PCR with detection of immobilized ampliﬁed product in a one-phase system  DIAPOPS  to speciﬁcally amplify and quantify a DNA fragment of the gaoA gene from F. graminearum.  Microsatellite-based probes were developed for  the detection of Epichloe¨ species in different grasses  Groppe and Boller 1997 . Mayer  2002  developed a Penicillium nordicum speciﬁc primer pair and a Taqman probe based on a polyketide synthase gene sequence for the detection of this species in cereal samples. Pearson and McKee  1992  developed a multiplex PCR method based on plasmid sequences the detection and discrimination of S. cerevisiae, Zygosaccharomyces bailii, and Z. rouxii in foods. Pearson et al.  1995  designed a PCR-based assay to detect retrotransposon long terminal repeat elements for the detection of Pichia membranefaciens.  for  4 CONCLUSIONS  responsible for  Fungi food spoilage cause signiﬁcant economic losses for food manufacturers. In order to minimize food spoilage and be able to predict the quality and shelf-life of a particular food, a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying food spoilage is essential. To achieve this goal, there is a need for the development of direct detection methods for spoilage organisms including fungi. The main aim being to develop a rapid, sensitive, robust, and speciﬁc method to use directly on the sample for the detection of food spoilage organisms. Rapid identiﬁcation of spoilage organisms is of profound importance to the food industry. This will enable intervention with appropriate measures to prevent serious economic losses. Rapid molecular techniques are valuable tools for screening foods and feeds for fungi. Among these, hybridization techniques have only rarely been used for direct detection of fungi, although novel develop- ments in this ﬁeld, including the application of PNA probes, and microarray techniques are encouraging. Ampliﬁcation- based methods are frequently applied for direct detection of spoilage organisms. Most PCR-based detection methods target part of the ribosomal RNA gene cluster, although SCAR markers are also widely used. For the detection of mycotoxin producing fungi, the most direct procedure is targeting of the mycotoxin biosynthetic genes. Such approaches have been used recently for the detection of a number of fungi-producing mycotoxins such as ATs, patulin, PR toxin, and trichothecenes, and projects for the detection of  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   fungi producing ochratoxins and fumonisins are in progress. The recent development of real-time PCR methodology has made it possible to quantify the amount of organisms in foods and feeds.  Sensitivity of a molecular method depends not only on the detection system, but also to a great extent on the food matrix. In order to increase sensitivity, adequate protocols have to be established in order to discern potential PCR inhibitors. The speed, accuracy, and reliability of detection methods can greatly be enhanced by enrichment procedures including the use of magnetic particles coated with speciﬁc binding proteins  antibodies or lectins ; by optimizing the DNA extraction protocol; or by using internal standard DNA in the PCR reaction. One of the main drawbacks of PCR-based detection methods is that DNA from dead cells can also be ampliﬁed leading to false positive results. This limitation can be addressed by including a propagation step prior to PCR, by using mRNA as template in NASBA or RT-PCR reactions. On the other hand, this disadvantage is only relative, since detection of dead mycotoxin producing fungi in a food matrix can serve as a prediction for mycotoxin contamination of the food.  The detection of microorganisms in food is still a time- consuming method particularly in the case of large-scale testing. The increasing availability of molecular kits for the detection of food-borne pathogenic bacteria is a step toward standardization of the molecular techniques. The develop- ment of similar kits for fungi causing food spoilage would be a further necessary step for the authorization of molecular methods as accepted detection methods in food microbiology.

The ripening seed is no exception and is contaminated by a wide range of bacteria, yeasts, and ﬁlamentous fungi via the air, insects, rain splash, equipment, and agronomic practices. When seeds cereal grains are harvested they thus carry a wide range of microbial contaminants. Postharvest treatment of such seeds and the prevailing environmental factors are key determinants of the impact that they may have on the quality of the seeds, including germinability. It is important to remember that both the harvested seeds grains and contaminating microorganisms are alive and respiring slowly under dry, safe storage conditions.  Poor postharvest management can lead to rapid deterio- ration in quality characteristics and severely decrease germinability and nutritional value of the seeds. Microbial activity can cause undesirable effects in grains including discoloration, contribute to heating and losses in dry matter through the utilization of carbohydrates as energy sources, degrade lipids and proteins or alter their digestibility, produce volatile metabolites giving off-odors, cause loss of germina- tion and baking and malting quality, affect use as animal feed or as seed, and ﬁlamentous fungal spoilage organisms may also produce mycotoxins that are highly toxic or carcinogenic or cause feed refusal and emesis  Christensen 1973 . The spores of some fungi can also cause respiratory disease hazards to exposed workers  Lacey and Crook 1988 .  Estimated losses of seeds, especially staple cereal grains in store from all causes varies widely. They may amount to 10% worldwide  Anon 1979  but can reach 50% in tropical regions  Hall 1970 . Vassan  1980  estimated losses of high moisture  paddy in southern India exceeded 15 – 25% in only 9 days, while Rohani et al.  1985  found storage losses of paddy in West Malaysia of only 1%.  Deterioration of grain by microorganisms is determined by several factors which can be classiﬁed into four main groups: intrinsic factors  those which depend on the characteristic of the growth substrate , extrinsic factors  those imposed from the outside , processing factors  those resulting from the agronomic practices and food processing, which primarily modify the composition of the microﬂora , and implicit factors  those depending on the particular dominant microbial ﬂora that initially develop in response to the intrinsic, processing, and extrinsic factors   Sinha 1995 . Figure 1 summarizes the factors affecting fungal colonization of the grain.  Wallace and Sinha  1981  in the 1970s were the ﬁrst to consider stored seeds as a man-made ecosystem which needed to be examined in a more holistic and ecological manner to enable a proper understanding of the processes occurring and to improve postharvest management of stored seeds of all types. This in many respects enabled prevention strategies to be developed and implemented to avoid microbial and pest infestation from damaging seeds. Generally, since most seeds are stored dry, bacteria seldom cause biodeterioration problems. At intermediate moisture content levels fungal spoilage and pests are of major concern. This Chapter will endeavor to examine some of these important abiotic and biotic factors and their interactions that determine whether deterioration will occur and the dominant fungal species which may be involved. This is important as the fungal community structure inﬂuences the type of deterioration and whether mycotoxins are produced. Cereal grains particularly wheat, barley, maize, and rice are used as examples of seed systems, since they represent the key staple seeds worldwide.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

Figure 1  Integration of the most important abiotic and biotic factors impacting on grain spoilage.  2 ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS WHICH  INFLUENCE FUNGAL ACTIVITY IN THE STORED SEED ECOSYSTEM  2.1 Water Availability—The Concept  2.1.1 Fundamental Principles  The extent to which seeds and grain are susceptible to spoilage fungi depends, above all, on the presence of water in the system. In fact, many authors have written about the fundamental requirement for water in microbial growth   Cooke and Whipps 1993; Grifﬁn 1981; Scott 1957 . Most stored products such as seeds and grain are hygroscopic in nature, i.e., they will either take up or release moisture until they reach a dynamic equilibrium with the surrounding environment. It is straightforward to express this water in terms of the percentage moisture content, based on the ratio of the dry weight to the wet weight  expressed either on a wet weight or dry weight basis . This, however, implies that the stored material consists of dry matter plus a certain amount of “attached” liquid water. In fact the situation is more complex than this. This is principally because the water in these substrates is not all equivalent, but held in a number of  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   different “states.” Broadly speaking, three main states of water can be identiﬁed in a hygroscopic material:  a  constitutive water; water that is chemically linked to the substrate material and forms part of its structural makeup,  b  adsorbed water, which is closely linked with the substrate surface by physical interactions, and  c  absorbed water, which is loosely associated with the substrate surface  Pixton 1967 . In practice, probably there is no clear demarcation between these different states; the relative proportions of each type will depend on the overall moisture content of the material. The absorbed water fraction will become more weakly bound as further layers of water molecules accumulate on the surfaces  i.e., as the substrate becomes wetter . It is the loosely held water that provides the “free” or “available” water, since it is the fraction that is most readily available for microbial growth, although its overall availability will be inﬂuenced by the presence of solutes. The important implication here is that microorganisms, including spoilage fungi, respond not to water content but to water availability. Therefore, the concept of water availability is of fundamental importance in relation to microbial growth and spoilage.  2.1.2 Water Activity  Water availability itself can be expressed in a number of ways, one of the most convenient being water activity  aw . The free water in a system is the proportion of the total water that is immediately available to reach equilibrium with the surrounding atmosphere. This will be reﬂected in the equilibrium vapor pressure or equilibrium relative humidity  ERH  exerted by the system. Water activity is deﬁned as the ratio of the vapor pressure of the water in a substrate to that of pure water at the same temperature and pressure  Scott 1957 . It is, therefore, directly linked to the ERH by the expression:  aw ¼ p=p0 ¼ ERHð%Þ=100 ðLabuza 1974Þ  where p is the vapor pressure of water in solution or solid substrate, p0, vapor pressure of pure water at experimental temperature and pressure, and ERH  %  is equilibrium relative humidity at which a solution or solid substrate neither gains nor loses moisture to the atmosphere.  Water activity can, therefore, be seen to be a measure of the ability of water to evaporate from a substrate and humidify the immediate environment, and is measured in the range 0 – 1.0 with 1.0 representing the aw of pure water. Most importantly it should be noted that aw is a function of temperature, and for a given substrate and moisture content, aw will increase with increasing temperature. This is primarily the consequence of the general increase in thermal motion  Multon 1988 .  2.1.3 Water Potential  Water availability may also be expressed as water potential  c . Water potential approaches the concept of water  availability in terms of the thermodynamics of systems, and considers the movement of water along gradients of potential energy. The term “water potential” is actually an abbreviation of “potential energy of water” and is deﬁned as “the free energy of water in a system relative to the free energy of a reference pool of pure free water having a speciﬁed mass or volume,” and is measured in J m3 or Pa  Papendick and Mulla 1985 . The reference state of pure free water is assigned zero. Water which is “constrained” in a system, i.e., the constitutive, adsorbed and  to a lesser extent  absorbed water is, therefore, at a lower  negative  water potential, and any microorganism must expend energy to lower internal water potential values relative to the exterior to make water available. The numerical value of water potential may be related to water activity using the formula:  c ¼ ðRT=V wÞ ln aw  ðPapendick and Mulla 1985Þ:  where R is gas constant, T, absolute temperature  K , and Vw is molecular weight of water.  Although c and aw are interconvertible by this expression, measurement of the separate components that make up total water potential cannot be carried out using water activity measurement, since water activity is not a sufﬁciently sensitive parameter.  2.1.4 Moisture Sorption Isotherms  The relationship between water content and aw in a given substrate may be usefully expressed by moisture sorption isotherms. These are curves produced by plotting water content against water activity, or ERH at constant temperature  hence, the term “isotherm” . They are highly speciﬁc to substrate type and condition but generally sigmoidal in shape show a steep rise in the curve above 80% ERH. The importance of moisture sorption isotherms is that they establish the relationship between moisture content and water availability for speciﬁc product types and, therefore, allow water availability to be set to safe levels from knowledge of moisture content alone. For most stored seed products safe moisture levels will typically correspond to water activity levels of around 0.7 water activity or 70% ERH. The actual moisture content which it corresponds to will vary greatly between seed types, and particularly between starchy and oily types. Moisture sorption isotherms are complicated by a hysteresis effect that inﬂuences the position of the curve depending on whether the material is being wetted or dried as each equilibrium point is plotted. This effect may account for a difference of as much as 0.5%  Pixton 1967  and always shows a higher water activity for a given moisture content where water is being sequentially added. This indicates that the “history” of the material is important and probably reﬂects irreversible and permanent changes occurring after wetting.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

For example, Penicillium species such P. aurantiogriseum and P. verrucosum can grow over the  range 2 4 to þ 358C while Aspergillus fumigatus has a very wide tolerance of 10 – 558C and Humicola lanuginosa in the range 30 – 608C. The majority of involved in deterioration in stored grain ecosystems thrive over the range 10 – 408C with optima in the range 25 – 358C. Lowering temperature reduces the metabolic activity of fungi and the grain, enabling longer mold-free storage periods. However, moist grain can be prone to slow deterioration by the genera Alternaria, Penicillium, and Fusarium, with species in each able to produce mycotoxins. Temperature of grain is a good indicator of quality during storage. Pockets of moisture can allow initiation of fungal activity that produces metabolic heat resulting in a succession of fungi becoming dominant and ending with spontaneous heating and dominance by thermotolerant thermophilic fungi and actinomycetes  Lacey and Magan 1991 .  3 POSTHARVEST FUNGAL COLONIZATION  OF CEREAL GRAINS  3.1 Factors  Conditions in the stored grain are more stable and controlled than those in the ﬁeld. Stored cereal grain offers a good ecological niche for fungi. The aw, temperature, O2 level, interactions with other organisms like insects, chemical preservatives, and storage time are considered the most important factors that control the growth of fungi in grains but cannot be considered in isolation. All these factors interact with each other during storage. For instance, ﬂuctuations in temperature can cause condensation of water that increases the water activity in pockets of stored grain. Damage to the kernels not only increases susceptibility to fungal invasion, especially if this occurs near the embryo, but also increases the likelihood of visible molding  Perez et al. 1982; Tuite et al. 1985; Lacey et al. 1991 .  2.3 Gas Composition  3.2 Mycoﬂora  While fungi involved in biodeterioration of grain are considered to be obligate aerobes, many are actually microaerophilic, being able to survive and grow in niches where other species cannot grow and, thus dominate specialized grain ecosystems. In many cases, decreasing O2 to , 0.14% is required before growth can be substantially reduced. Increasing CO2 to . 50% is required for inhibition of growth  Magan and Lacey 1984a . Some species, e.g., P. roqueforti, are able to grow and infect grain at . 80% CO2 provided at least 4% O2 is available. The use of integrated postharvest systems for prevention of deterioration entails modifying O2 and CO2 simultaneously and the use of  O2 free  N2. The tolerance to low O2 and high CO2 is also inﬂuenced by interactions with grain water availability. The treatment is more effective if the grain is dry. Controlled atmosphere storage is used for both control of molds and insects in moist stored seed systems. Regimes sufﬁcient for molds may not, however, be effective against some storage insects that can survive and grow over a wide ERH range.  In summary, from the whole range of factors that can affect the colonization of seeds by microorganisms, aw is the most important single factor limiting their activity. Each microorganism has a speciﬁc range over which they can develop. Fungi are the most important group of micro- organisms with capacity to colonize seeds because special- ized groups can grow at intermediate and low aw levels. Fungi contribute greatly to seed losses, either alone or together with insects. Because the environment and other factors can change during seed grain ﬁlling, harvest, and storage the  The number of fungal species that can be found colonizing stored grain is very wide. These represent a high number of genera and include psychrotolerant, mesophilic, thermophilic, xerophilic, and hydrophilic species  Hill and Lacey 1983; Lacey et al. 1980; Magan and Lacey 1984a,b,c . The most characteristic of these are species belonging to the genus Aspergillus and Penicillium. In addition, it is possible to ﬁnd species of Eurotium, Fusarium, Rhizopus, and thermophilics like Talaromyces thermophilus, Rhizomucor pusillus, and Thermomyces lanuginosus  Figure 2 . All these species are widespread in their occurrence throughout the world and they cover almost the whole range of environmental conditions likely to be found in stored grain.  The aw and temperature are very important factors that determine the mycoﬂora present in stored grains. The fungi present in the ﬁeld such as Alternaria species that need high levels of aw to grow, decrease in importance when the grain is stored and subjected to processing practices directed to decrease the water activity. On the other hand, genera such as Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Eurotium that have a low importance in the ﬁeld, become very important during the storage of the grains. Another factor that determines the mycoﬂora in grain is the oxygen concentration, because the fungi are generally very sensitive to low oxygen concentrations. Under these conditions Magan and Lacey  1984  reported that Fusarium culmorum, P. roqueforti, and A. candidus were the most tolerant, which is consistent with the fungal community found on cereals under airtight storage.

Figure 2 Succession of dominant fungi found in stored grain depending on it initial water activity and temperature [adopted from Lacey et al.  1980 ].  Both climatic conditions and geographical location can explain the differences found in the mycoﬂora of different grains in the ﬁeld. During storage, however, the mycoﬂora is very similar for all grains  Pelhate 1988 . Many of the species found on maize, sorghum, rice, and other cereals in tropical climates are the same as those found in temperate regions except for a small number of additional species and, perhaps, a greater frequency of Aspergillus and fewer or different Penicillium spp.  4 ECOLOGY OF GERMINATION, GROWTH,  AND MYCOTOXIN PRODUCTION  To colonize grain, fungi need to be capable of germinating and growing under the prevailing environmental conditions If conditions are appropriate, found in the substrate. establishment can also result in the accumulation of mycotoxins. Consequently, it is very important to understand the interacting ecological conditions that can avoid fungal colonization of the grain. The main environmental factors that affect germination, growth, and mycotoxin production by fungi are aw, temperature, and intergranular atmosphere. Species differ in their ecological requirements and in their tolerance of low aw and marginal temperatures. Germination of conidia and mycelial growth of isolates of some  Penicillium, Aspergillus, and Fusarium spp. isolated from maize grain have been found to be signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by aw, temperature, and their interactions. The effects of aw and temperature on germination can be quantiﬁed in two ways:  a  the minimum aw for germination and  b  the lag time before germination.  Fungi normally found in stored grain can germinate at lower aw levels than the fungi present in the ﬁeld, especially in temperate grains  Table 1 . Changes in tolerance to low aw occur when changing temperature level. A. niger germinates only down to 0.95 at 108C, but down to 0.90 at 158C, and to 0.80 at 258C. P. hordei germinates down to 0.90 at 58C, but down to 0.85 at 258C. F. verticillioides germinates only down to 0.96 at 58C, but down to 0.88 at 258C  Marin et al. 1996, 1998a .  In general, the lag time before germination increases with decreasing aw. With water readily available  . 0.98  the lag time can range from a few hours to a few days, while at very low aw it can extend for months or even years  Magan and Lacey 1984a; Marin et al. 1998a; Pitt 1975 . For example, the shortest lag phases for species of Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Fusarium are at 0.994 and 0.95 aw over a wide range of temperatures  Marin et al. 1996, 1998a   Figure 3 . At marginal temperatures the lag phases increases, more markedly for P. aurantiogriseum and P. hordei at . 308C and , 158C  Marin et al. 1998a .

Also, conidia can survive for long periods of time depending on the relative humidity and temperature. All of this information gives us an idea about the potential capability to colonize the stored grain ecosystem if the conditions change and become favorable for fungal development.  Figure 3 Effect of water activity and temperature on the germination rate of A. ﬂavus, A. niger, P. aurantiogriseum, and P. hordei on MMEA. Water activity levels are 0.994  W , 0.95  K , 0.90  A , 0.85  X , and 0.80  O . Error bars show standard error of estimated parameters [from Marin et al.  1996 ].  Successful spore germination results in the formation of extending hyphae that are able to colonize the substrate. Hydrolytic enzymes are produced to utilize the rich nutritional substrate. Water activity and temperature are very important factors impacting on the level of infection of the grain and the extent of colonization. The interaction between these factors is critical in developing an under- standing of their interrelationship with one another, and their role in initiation of molding.  individual species,  the ecology of  The range of aw temperature conditions for germination is generally found to be wider than that for mycelial growth, as recently shown for fumonisin-producing species of Fusarium from maize, and for other Aspergillus and Penicillium spp.  Magan and Lacey 1984a; Marin et al. 1996 . Changing aw at different steady-state temperatures affected growth rates of all the species examined  Marin et al. 1996, 1998a . Fusarium species grow faster on irradiated maize at 258C than at 158C. Maximum growth rates of about 3.6, 3.5, and 10.4 mm d were obtained for F. verticillioides, F. proliferatum, and F. graminearum, respectively, at 0.98 aw and 258C. However, these three species had a growth rate of about 0.4, 0.5, and 1.2 mm d at 0.93 aw and 158C, respectively  Marin et al. 1998b .  While most fungi grow optimally close to 1.00 aw at their optimum growth temperature, others grow better at lower aw. For instance, Eurotium amstelodami, E. repens, A. niger and A. versicolor and A. ochraceus all grow faster at 0.90 – 0.95 aw at optimum temperatures  Ayerst 1965; Magan and Lacey 1984a; Ramos et al. 1999a,b . Some Penicillium spp. also grow better nearer to 0.98 than at 1.00 aw  Hocking and Pitt 1979 . However, at marginal temperatures for growth, optima are almost always close to 1.00 aw. The effects of aw and temperature on fungal growth and other activities in stored grain may be further modiﬁed by changes in the concentration of O2 and CO2 in the intergranular atmosphere resulting from respiration  Magan and Lacey 1984b , and the addition of preservatives  Marin et al. 1999b .  The production of mycotoxins has been studied mostly at optimum aw and temperature levels on either rich laboratory media or on autoclaved wheat, barley, or rice. Few studies have considered the effects of environmental factors, especially water stress on mycotoxin production. The conditions of aw temperature that permit mycotoxin pro- duction differ from those for the fungal growth  Table 2 . For instance, F. verticillioides and F. proliferatum, at minimum aw temperature for growth  e.g., 0.89 – 0.91 aw  did not produce detectable levels of FB1  Marin et al. 1999a . The minimum aw allowing growth of 12 species of fungi was usually lower and the temperature range wider than those permitting aﬂatoxin, patulin, penicillic acid, ochratoxin, or fumonisins production  Marin et al 1999a,c; Northolt 1979 . Moreover, the effect of these factors can differ for two toxins produced by the same species. For instance, ochratoxin production by A. ochraceus on poultry feed was greatest at 308C and 0.95 aw while penicillic acid production was favored by 228C and 0.90 aw.

It interspeciﬁc and intraspeciﬁc interactions will occur depending on the nutritional substrate of the grain. Furthermore, environmental factors may exert a selective pressure inﬂuencing community structure and dominance of individual species. It is important to understand the type of interactions that occur between fungi under different environmental regimes in grain to enable better prediction of not just dominance by key spoilage fungi, but also the potential for production of mycotoxins. Wicklow  1988  used the in vitro interactions between hyphae of different fungi based on:  a  intermingling of hyphae,  b  inhibition on contact, inhibition at a distance, and  d  dominance by one species over another on contact, and  e  inhibition by one species at a distance with the dominant species continuing to grow. They used these categories to develop an index of antagonism by giving numerical scores to each interaction type. This enabled antagonistic interactions between A. ﬂavus and a range of species to be identiﬁed. However, these studies did not examine the dynamics of interacting environmental factors and dominance of species. Subsequent studies by Magan and Lacey  1984c, 1985  modiﬁed this scoring system to give a higher numerical score to fungi able to dominate in vitro than antagonism and developed an index of dominance  ID  to assist with interpreting patterns of colonization and dominance in grain ecosystems. The ID was found to signiﬁcantly change with aw and temperature and also with nutritional grain substrate. Of the 15 species, the most competitive species in wheat grain in United Kingdom were found to be P. brevicompactum, P. hordei, P. roqueforti, A. fumigatus, and A. nidulans.  Decreasing the aw conditions increased competitiveness of P. brevicompactum. Only F. culmorum could compete with storage molds, at . 0.93 – 0.95 aw. They also found that rate of growth was not directly related to dominance. Previously, Ayerst  1965  had suggested that speed of germination and growth were key determinants of colonization of nutrient rich matrices such as grain. The ID approach has been adapted over the years for many food-based ecosystems.  that  More recently, alternative approaches have been utilized to try and understand the relative competitiveness of different species within fungal communities colonizing grain. It was suggested by Wilson and Lindow  1994a,b  the coexistence of microorganisms particularly on plant surfaces may be mediated by nutritional resource partitioning. Thus in vitro carbon utilization patterns could be used to determine niche overlap indices  NOI  and, thus the level of ecological similarity. Based on the range of similar c-sources utilized and those unique to an individual isolate of species they suggested that NOI values of . 0.9 were indicative of coexistence between species in an ecological niche, while scores of , 0.9 represented occupation of separate niches. This approach was modiﬁed by Lee and Magan  1999a,b  and Marin et al.  1998c  to include a multifactorial approach by including water availability and temperature into the system. This approach demonstrated that based on utilization of maize c-sources the NOIs for F. verticillioides and F. proliferatum were . 0.90 at . 0.96 aw at 25 and 308C, indicative of coexistence with other species such as Penicillium species, A. ﬂavus and A. ochraceus. However, for some species pairing with F. verticillioides resulted in NOI values , 0.80 indicating occupation of different niches. Interestingly, no correlation could be found between ID and NOI methods. The results suggested that niche overlap was in a state of ﬂux and signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by both temperature and water availability. The nutrient status is very important as Lee and Magan  1999  demonstrate that comparison of c-sources in a standard BIOLOG test plate with only those relevant to maize  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   grain gave very different results in terms of niche size and NOI under different environmental conditions. This approach conﬁrms that interactions and dominance are dynamic and not static and emphasizes the importance of taking account of such ﬂuxes in any integrated approach to control the activity of spoilage molds in the stored seed ecosystem.  5 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MOLD  DETERIORATION OF CEREAL GRAIN AND CALORIFIC LOSSES  It is surprising to note that few studies have been conducted if poor postharvest practices can result in the nutritional quality loss of grain due to the activity of spoilage fungi  Sinha 1982 . Different grains have different levels of intrinsic caloriﬁc values and, thus deterioration by different spoilage fungi will affect these values to different extents. Elegant studies by Demenyk and Sinha  1988 , Sinha  1995 , and Sinha et al.  1986  demonstrated that the bioenergetics of insects feeding on different grain types enables energy budgets to be established and provided useful information on the impact that pests have on actual caloriﬁc value of stored cereals. However, in stored grain ecosystems factors such as aw, temperature, gas composition, and level of fungal contami- nation will all have a signiﬁcant impact on caloriﬁc losses and provide a useful link with quantiﬁable levels of dry matter losses for different cereals.  Studies by Prasada and Prasad  1982  reported changes in linseed  Linum usitatissimum;  L ¼ 1:896 kJ=g  due to seed-borne infection by spoilage  the caloriﬁc value of  fungi. They found that A. niger infection resulted in maximal caloriﬁc losses of 25.2% within 15 days, and almost 50% in 30 days at 288C on surface sterilized seeds. Losses from autoclaved and inoculated seeds were higher. However, water availability was not monitored or controlled. More recent studies where both aw and temperature were carefully controlled have examined the effects caused by the mycotoxin producing species of F. verticillioides and F. proliferatum and A. ochraceus  Marin et al. 1999c; Ramos et al. 1999a,b . The Fusarium spp. were found to maximally cause caloriﬁc losses  of maize based substrates  ¼ 19.69 kJ g  at 0.98 aw  17 – 64%   after 4 weeks depending on temperature of incubation, but negligible at 0.92 aw  0 – 9% . An inverse correlation was found between caloriﬁc losses and fungal biomass and fumonisin production. For A. ochraceus caloriﬁc losses were maximal at 0.95 aw and 20 – 308C on similar maize-based substrates. Losses were in the region of 10 – 17% over 4 weeks with much lower losses at 0.85 aw  0 – 7% . There was a direct relationship between increase in fungal biomass and caloriﬁc losses. As each grain type has a different intrinsic caloriﬁc value it is critical that these studies are expanded to include rice and other staple cereals to enable the relationship between the activity of spoilage fungi in stored cereals to be quantiﬁed both on the basis of the signiﬁcance of nutritional losses and in terms of dry matter losses.  6 RESPIRATION AND DRY MATTER  LOSSES  Harvested grain carries a wide range of bacterial and fungal contaminants. Depending on effectiveness of storage conditions, and the climatic region of the world the level and type of contamination will vary. Grain itself and the microbial contaminants respire slowly when stored dry. However, if the water availability is increased to 15 – 19%  moisture content  ¼ 0.75 – 0.85 aw  predominantly spoilage  fungi, particularly Eurotium spp., Aspergillus, and Peni- cillium species grow resulting in a signiﬁcant increase in respiratory activity, resulting in increased temperature and sometimes spontaneous heating that results in colonization by thermophilic fungi and actinomycetes  Fleurat-Lessard 2002; Lacey and Magan 1991 . The chemical process involved in heat generation is predominantly aerobic oxidation of carbohydrates such as starch. The energy is released by the following equation:  C6H12 þ 6O2 ! 6CO2 þ 6H2O þ 2835 kJ  Heating occurs when this energy is released faster than it can escape from the cereal substrate. In contrast, little energy is released in anaerobic respiration and little or no heating occurs in the absence of oxygen. The requirement for oxygen increases with temperature to a maximum of 408C but does not decrease greatly until the temperature exceeds 658C. At this temperature, microbial growth is largely inhibited and heating results from exothermic chemical oxidation. Thus, the respiratory quotient may be 0.7 to 0.9 up to 658C but less than 0.5 at higher temperatures.  By utilizing the respiratory quotient CO2 production can be translated into dry matter loss. Typically, complete respiration of carbohydrates gives a respiratory quotient, i.e., ratio of O2 consumed to CO2 produced of 1.0, and it has been calculated that 14.7 g CO2 kg grain will be released for every 1% loss of grain dry matter. During anaerobic fermentation, only about 0.493 g CO2 is evolved from a kilogram grain for every 1% dry matter loss. Alternatively, a respiratory quotient below 1.0 may result from lipid or protein metabolism. For example, tripalmitim has a quotient of 0.7. The higher the CO2 production, the shorter the safe storage period without loss of dry matter. Studies by Jonsson et al.  2000  utilized respiratory rates over a wide range of aw levels and temperatures to examine development of molds such as P. verrucosum in stored grain and also effects on germinability, fungal biomass, and maximum safe storage times in days. They suggested that the maximum storage time without mold growth was probably halved if moisture content  at harvest was increased by 1 – 3%  ¼ 0.05 aw  or if storage temperature was increased by 58C. Fleurat-Lessard  2002  in his excellent review has suggested that for the modeling and prediction of global quality changes the rate of CO2 production can be used as a “storability risk factor.”  The ratio of contribution of spoilage molds and grain to total respiration has been argued for many years. A range of  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   studies has demonstrated that grain deterioration and by implication dry matter loss is predominantly determined by fungal activity. Wheat deterioration has been measured and models developed based on germination rates, visible mold growth, or respiration of grain and microorganisms  Fleurat- Lessard 2002 . Kreyger  1972  pointed out, from previous work with wheat that dry matter loss was unimportant, provided there was no visible molding. However, his own  work showed that barley of 24% water content  ¼ 0.94 aw  stored at 168C for 10 weeks lost 2% dry matter with visible molding. With maize showed that fungal invasion and aﬂatoxin content could be unacceptable before the grain had lost 0.5% dry matter and mold growth became visible  Seitz et al. 1982 . Latif and Lissik  1986  proposed a model for respiration based on the rate of dry matter breakdown, but was not related to important environmental factors such as aw and temperature. This worked suggested that Kreyger’s assump- tions were not completely accurate. White et al.  1982  noted that 0.1% was unacceptable for ﬁrst grade wheat and proposed an absolute level of 0.04%. However, when 55 days safe storage was predicted for grain stored at 18.4% mc   ¼ 0.86 aw  visible molding occurred after 23 days of storage.  Recently, Karunakaran et al.  2001  determined deterioration rates in wheat stored at constant or step decreases in temperature. Deterioration rates at 17% mc for wheat were 5, 7, and 15 days at 35, 30, and 258C, respectively. Interestingly, they found that respiration rates of 17 – 19% mc wheat at 258C increased while germination percentages decreased with storage time. Dry matter losses were about 0.05% and visible mold was observed when dry matter loss was about 0.1% at these w.c.s.  There are problems with the use of visible molding as a criterion of deterioration  Hamer et al. 1991; Lacey et al. 1994 . While Kreyger  1972  used this extensively, a clear deﬁnition was not produced. Many workers have questioned this subjective index of the safe storability of grain  Hamer et al. 1991; Lacey and Magan 1991 . Magan  1993  pointed out as an early indicator, microscopic growth may be a more effective measurement of fungal activity than visible molding.  7 BIOCHEMICAL TESTS  A wide variety of methods have been used to quantify the fungal activity in stored grain. Chitin, ergosterol, adenine triphosphate, immunoﬂuorescence, immunoassays, and DNA probes have all been developed  Fleurat-Lessard 2002; Magan 1993 . Since, ergosterol is the predominant sterol in most spoilage fungi  ascomycetes and deuteromycetes  and not found in insect pests it has been utilized extensively as an indicator of whether deterioration has occurred in grain. The method was ﬁrst described by Seitz et al.  1977  and can now be performed relatively quickly and routinely using simple extraction and HPLC. It has thus been used extensively for the in vitro quantiﬁcation of biomass of spoilage fungi which demonstrated that this does change with culture age  Marﬂeet  the ergosterol content  et al. 1991 . Cahagnier and Richard Mollard  1991  suggested that in storage fungi was not signiﬁcantly affected by environmental factors such as aw. They thus suggested that ergosterol could be used as an “index” of the level of fungal biomass and the length of storage of the grain. Tothill et al.  1993  showed that there was a signiﬁcant positive correlation between ergosterol content and total CFUs at 0.95 aw, while in grain of 0.85 aw there was no signiﬁcant correlation. Grain inoculated with individual species  Alternaria alternata, E. amstelodami, and P. aurantiogriseum  at 0.95 0.85 aw and 258C showed a signiﬁcant correlation between CFUs and ergosterol although the content for an individual species varied considerably. Overall, levels of , 5 – 6 mg g can be found in fresh wheat grain, with that having microscopic growth containing about 7.5 – 12 mg g. This correlates with a threshold of 105 CFUs g grain as a spoilage threshold indicator. Fleurat-Lessard  2002  has suggested that perhaps modeling of ergosterol production rates under different environmental conditions using sigmoid curves similar to those used for insect population dynamics may enable the use of an ergosterol index in the future when correlation models become available. It may also be possible to use both ergosterol and the production of mycotoxins in predicting potential environmental factors over which spoilage mycotoxins may be produced. Two-dimensional models for growth and fumonisin production have already been developed  Marin et al. 1999a,b,c  and such information may be useful in further development of predictive models for risk assessment of spoilage and toxin contamination. Perhaps, modeling of cumulative ergosterol production by spoilage fungi and associated mycotoxins in relation to aw, temperature, time, gas composition  modiﬁed atmosphere storage , and time may allow more effective and precise risk assessment of mold contamination and mycotoxin occurrence to the consumer.  8 ENZYME CHANGES AS AN INDICATOR  OF DETERIORATION  Changes in grain enzyme concentrations, e.g., amylases, due to fungal deterioration are important as they have an impact on processing and bread making quality of ﬂour and dough. However, studies which examined a-amylase, b-amylase, and total amylases of wheat found no correlation with the time to microscopic visible molding  Magan 1993 . Fleurat- Lessard  2002  suggested that for both wheat and malting barley enzyme changes are too small and occur to late as functions of storage conditions and duration, especially with regard to incorporation in a model for decision support systems.  However,  there are other studies which suggests the opposite. Fungi colonizing the rich grain substrate under conducive environmental conditions produce a battery of hydrolytic enzymes for degrading the grains and causing the dry matter losses discussed earlier in this Chapter. Flannigan  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   and Bana  1980  and Magan  1993  showed that aw and temperature affect the production of enzymes by fungi during grain colonization, including cellulases, polygacturonase, pectin methyl esterase, 1-4-b-glucanase, b-glucosidase, b-xylosidase, and lipases. Jain et al.  1991  were the ﬁrst to demonstrate that by using chromogenic 4-nitrophenol substrates in an ELISA well format, rapid quantiﬁcation could be carried out for a range of hydrolytic enzymes, provided that substrates were available for them. They demonstrated that in both barley and wheat grain at different aw levels  0.85, 0.90, and 0.95  signiﬁcant increases in N-acetyl-b-D-glucosaminidase were produced when com- pared to nonmolded dry harvested grain. Grain inoculated with the xerophile E. amstelodami also showed marked increases in a-D-galactosidase.  Fusaria  producing  Magan  1993  extended this and examined stored dry grain with that at different aw levels and temperatures of incubation. This showed that a signiﬁcant change in the production of some enzymes was evident at times of microscopic and visible molding. Of seven enzymes examined signiﬁcant changes in b-D-glucoaminidase, b-D-glactosidase, and b-D-glucosidase were observed by the time microscopic growth had occurred. Similar results were obtained with verticillioides, fumonisin F. proliferatum  by Marin et al.  1998d . Changes could be monitored within 72 h of storage. They also suggested that these enzymes could be used as an early indicator of infection of maize grain by such species and that these enzymes were important in enabling rapid colonization over a wide range of environmental factors. Recent work by Keshri and Magan  1998  and Keshri et al.  2002  have also suggested similar hydrolytic enzymes are an early indicator of fungal activity in vitro on wheat ﬂour-based media and in bread substrates. Thus, potential does now exist for the use of such relatively simple enzyme assays to be used as a possible tool for early detection of fungal activity in cereal grain.   F.  9 VIABILITY AND DEGRADATION OF  GRAIN  Fungal activity inevitably leads to deterioration and loss in viability of grain to be used as seed. Whether seed death occurs directly due to fungal activity or due to degradation of key grain nutritional components is, however, unclear. Under some circumstances fungi have been shown to be key components in deterioration of viability. The grain embryo is sometimes preferentially invaded by some fungi, especially species of Aspergillus and Penicillium. In most early classical work it was demonstrated that spoilage of stored grain resulted in seed viability being rapidly reduced to practically zero. Hill and Lacey  1983  found a linear relationship between initial moisture content and percentage viability. However, few studies in the last decade have examined the detailed changes in nutritional components of grain. Thus, we are reliant on other earlier work for such information.  9.1 Carbohydrate Degradation  Starchy cereal grains contain 75% carbohydrates that are hydrolyzed during respiration by amylases. As indicated earlier, while fungal invasion does lead to increases in reducing sugars these changes are not early enough as an early indicator of deterioration  Magan 1993 .  9.2 Protein Degradation  Total proteins represents about 14.5% of the grain dry matter in wheat and quality can vary considerably  Aspinall and Greenwood 1965 . Protein type, quality, and amount are all important for bread and baking quality. It is thus surprising that, although protein quality is important to human nutrition few studies have attempted to analyze in detail the impact that fungal activity might have on this component. No changes in total protein during spoilage and heating, while others found an increase in total protein. Colonization of wheat grain by fungi such as A. tenuis, A. ﬂavus, A. niger, and F. solani resulted in an increase in total protein although aw or temperature considerations were not considered. More research is needed on the potential changes, particularly in storage proteins that may occur due to fungal invasion of grain.  9.3 Lipid Degradation  Starchy grains contain about 2.5% lipids while oil rich seeds contain much more  Aspinall and Greenwood 1965 . Lipids can be degraded endogenously and via fungal invasion, both by oxidation and by hydrolysis, with lipoxygenases and lipases, respectively  Zeleny and Coleman 1938 . Usually an increase in free fatty acids in the seeds is indicative of utilization by spoilage fungi. Indeed Magan et al.  1993  demonstrated that free fatty acid values for different spoilage fungi varied considerably with aw and temperature in in vitro studies with rape seed oil and with rape seed. Farag et al.  1985a,b  had earlier showed that fungal lipases degraded different classes of lipids by degrading triglycerides to mono diglycerides and free fatty acids.  10 FUNGAL VOLATILES AS AN EARLY  INDICATOR OF DETERIORATION  The production of volatiles by fungi when colonizing grain has been quantiﬁed and the key components identiﬁed in vitro and in situ  Kaminski et al 1974; Magan and Evans 2000; Schnurer et al. 1999 . Key volatiles indicative of spoilage include 3-octanone, methylheptanone, 2-methyl-1-propanol, cyclohexanone, trimethylbenzene, undecane, naphthalene, and dodecane. Previous in situ studies have demonstrated that measurement of such volatiles show promise in early  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

The rapid development of electronic nose technology, which uses a variety of sensor arrays for giving qualitative information on changes in patterns of volatile production, has enabled this technology to be examined in detail for practical applications in the grain commodity chain. Evans et al.  2000  demonstrated that it was possible to classify grain samples in real time into categories of good quality, molded, or suspect grain using an automated computer controlled system coupled with radial based models. The potential for using odor classiﬁcation from grain as a spoilage indicator has also been demonstrated  Magan and Evans 2000 . Work has also shown that e.nose technology could be used for differentiating between different isolates of the same spoilage species on the basis of qualitative volatile production patterns, which may differ due to speciﬁc biosynthetic pathways for isolates producing mycotoxins in Fusarium section Liseola species  Keshri and Magan 2001 ; and in naturally contaminated grain samples  Olssen et al. 2002 .  11 BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF SPOILAGE  IN MOIST CEREALS  Storage of moist cereals for animal feed is quite common in temperate climatic regions. Usually to achieve this, cereals are kept sealed to allow a build up of CO2 to inhibitory concentrations with very low O2 concentrations. Sometimes, improper sealing enables spoilage to proceed rapidly, especially by microaerophilic species such as P. roqueforti, P. carneum, and P. paneum. This results in poor quality animal feed with potential contamination with mycotoxins  Petersson and Schnurer 1998 . Recent studies in Sweden have approached this problem by the use of antagonistic and competitive yeasts such as Pichia anomala which can be inoculated onto wheat, barley, or oats prior to storage. This yeast effectively colonizes the stored cereal and prevents spoilage molds from causing deterioration in feed grain quality. P. anomola has been found to be effective at controlling growth of P. roqueforti in moist cereals  Petersson and Schnurer 1998 . Recent studies indicate that antagonistic yeasts such as P. anomala may also affect ochratoxin A accumulation by P. verrucosum, and other important toxigenic species in cool temperate climates  Petersson et al. 1998 . This approach has not been examined for moist tropical cereals destined for animal feed where often spoilage fungi can invade preharvest and thus make postharvest control more difﬁcult. This could, however, be a promising area for inoculant treatments, especially for animal feedstuffs free of mycotoxin contamination.  future commercialization of natural  12 CONCLUSIONS  In many areas of research, a better understanding of the science of the spoilage fungi and their role in deterioration of  seeds has been achieved in the last decade. Certainly, the key role of spoilage molds, the conditions under which they may produce mycotoxins, early detection systems and predictions of dry matter losses, and an understanding of the complex interactions that occur in the stored seed ecosystem are better understood. In certain areas, particularly with regard to quantifying nutritional losses generally and quantifying degradation of grain components needs to be moved forward in the coming years. It is critical that such studies are linked to and correlated with other measures of quality loss of stored seeds, especially staple grains. This would enable us to realize the goal of developing realistic and accurate decision support systems for effective conservation of seeds postharvest. In the coming years we will need to build on this sound foundation in developing strategies for the prevention of spoiled grain and mycotoxins entering the human and animal food chain.

They encompass a considerable variety of low molecular weight compounds with diverse chemical structures and biological activities. Some mycotoxins could also be toxic to plants or other microorganisms; but these compounds are not classiﬁed as antibiotics of fungal origin. Like most microbial secondary metabolites, the fungi themselves is still not clearly deﬁned. In considering the effects of mycotoxins on animals, to distinguish between “mycotoxicosis” and “mycosis.” Myco- toxicosis is used to describe the action of mycotoxin s  and is frequently mediated through a number of organs, notably the liver, kidney, lungs, and the nervous, endocrine, and immune systems. On the other hand, “mycosis” refers to a generalized invasion of  CAST 2003; Chu 1998 . Due to their diverse chemical structures, mycotoxins may exhibit a number of biological effects, including both acute and chronic toxic effects as well as carcinogenic, mutagenic  genotoxic, teratogenic, and immunotoxic effects  Bhatnagar et al. 2002; Chu 1998; 2002; Wogan 1992 . Modulation of the animal immuno- system, either immunosuppressive  most often  or immuno- stimulatory, also plays an important role for the overall toxic effects  Bondy and Pestka 2000 . The interaction of mycotoxins with cellular macromolecules plays a dominant  living tissue s  by growing fungi  role in their toxic actions  Chu 2002; Hussein and Brasel 2001 . Recent studies on the effect of mycotoxins on apoptosis have further revealed their mode of action at the cellular level  Chu 2002 . The complexity of the biological effects of mycotoxins has led to a scientiﬁc discipline named “mycotoxicology” for the study of various issues that are encountered with this group of toxins.  Mycotoxins have been the subject of many reviews, and recently several comprehensive reviews have discussed various aspects of this topic  Bhatnagar et al. 2002; CAST 2003; Chu 2002; Scudmore 2000 . Due to a limitation of space, in this chapter we have tried to cover, as much as possible, the most recent advances achieved in the ﬁeld, and refered primarily to reviews listing all the previous landmark references in the ﬁeld.  1.2 Historical Background  Although mycotoxicoses have been known for a long time, identiﬁcation of a speciﬁc mycotoxin as a causative agent for these illnesses was unknown in most of the incidences [reviewed in Bhatnagar et al.  2002 ]. For example, at least one of the 10 plagues in ancient Egypt recorded in Exodus  and as early as 430 B.C.  could have been associated with mycotoxin-contamination of food. Since the ninth century, ergot-infected rye has  ergotism  afﬂicted large-populations in Europe, when ergotism was called ignis sacer  sacred ﬁre  or St. Anthony’s ﬁre, because it was believed that a pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Anthony would bring relief from the intense burning sensation caused by the mycotoxin  Van Dongen and DeGroot 1995 .  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   Outbreaks of toxicoses associated with the ingestion of moldy foods and feeds by humans and animals have also been recorded in last century. Deaths of livestock were reported earlier from consumption of moldy corn in feed of horses in Illinois, Russia and swine in Southeastern United States  Christiansen and Kauffman 1969  in the 1930s. A well-documented example is the disease called alimentary toxic aleukia  ATA  that resulted in more than 5000 deaths in humans in the Orenberg district of the USSR during World War II, and the cause of later was found to be trichothecene mycotoxins. Modern myco- toxicology was not developed until the discovery of aﬂatoxins in the early 1960s as the causative agent in the peanut meal causing the “Turkey X” disease that killed more than 10,000 turkeys fed with the contaminated meal. Because aﬂatoxins are a series of highly potent carcino- gens produced by commonly occurring Aspergillus ﬂavus and A. parasiticus, research has focused new attention on mycotoxins. In the last 40 years, many new mycotoxins and their have been identiﬁed and characterized, biosynthetic origin in various fungi elucidated. It has been estimated that at least 25% of the world’s agricultural product is contaminated with mycotoxins and certain diseases have been linked to ingestion of food and feed contaminated with mycotoxins. Recent evidence that indoor air pollution from toxigenic fungi may play a role in illnesses may implicate mycotoxins as having a more widespread role in chronic disease than was previously thought possible  CAST 2003 .  2 PRODUCTION OF MYCOTOXINS BY  TOXICOGENIC FUNGI  2.1 General Consideration  Invasion by fungi and production of mycotoxins in commodities can occur under favorable conditions in the ﬁeld  preharvest , at harvest, and during processing, transportation and storage  Bhatnagar et al. 2002 . Fungi that are frequently found in the ﬁeld include A. ﬂavus, Alternaria longipes, A. alternata, Claviceps purpura, Fusarium verti- cillioides  previously called moniliforme , F. graminearum, and a number of other Fusarium spp. Species most likely introduced at harvest include F. sporotrichioides, Stachy- botrys atra, Cladosporium sp., Myrothecium verrucaria, Trichothecium roseum, as well as A. alternata. Most penicillia are storage fungi. These include Penicillium citrinum, P. cyclopium, P. citreoviride, P. islandicum, P. rubrum, P. viridicatum, P. urticae, P. verruculosum, P. palitans, P. puberulum, P. expansum, and P. roqueforti, all of which are capable of producing mycotoxins in grains and are: A. parasiticus, A. ﬂavus, A. versicolor, A. ochraceus, A. clavatus, A. rubrum, A. chevallieri, F. verticillioides, F. tricinctum, F. nivale, and several other Fusarium spp. the mycotoxin- producing fungi belong to three genera: Aspergillus, Fusarium, and Penicillium. However, not all species in these genera are toxicogenic.  is apparent, most of  foods. Other  fumigatus, A.  toxicogenic  storage  fungi  It  1.3 Economic Impact of Mycotoxin  Contamination  The most obvious negative economic impact of myco- toxins is an outright loss of crops and affected animals, particularly when a severe outbreak occurs. However, even lower mycotoxin levels in feed affect animal health by causing feed refusal and an increased susceptibility to infection. Crops contaminated with mycotoxins at certain levels cannot be sold for human animal consumption in countries, which have rigorous regulatory requirement for acceptable level of these compounds. However, humans and animals may encounter severe health hazard or high mortality rates regulation or monitoring programs as result of exposure to higher levels of toxins in foods and feeds. In addition, costs of chemical analyses, quality control and regulatory programs, research development, extension services, lawsuits, and the cost of treatment of human illness must be considered in the overall economic burden of mycotoxins on the economy worldwide. Thus, the negative economic impact  crop boss  resulting from mycotoxin contamination is certainly very signiﬁcant  CAST 2003 , and estimated to be $932 million annually from aﬂatoxins, fumonisins, and deoxynivalenol contamination of crops.  in countries with less  2.2 Factors Affecting Mycotoxin Production  factors  Genetics and environmental and nutritional factors greatly affect the formation of mycotoxins. Depending on the susceptibility of the crop, geographic and seasonal factors, as well as cultivation, harvesting, storage, and transpor- tation practices, mycotoxins are found worldwide  D’Mello and MacDonald 1997 . In the ﬁeld, weather conditions, plant stress, invertebrate vectors, species and spore load of infective fungi, variations within plant and fungal species, and microbial competition all signiﬁcantly affect myco- toxin production. Physical time of exposure, temperature during exposure, humidity, and extent of insect or other damage to the commodity prior to exposure determine mycotoxin contamination in the ﬁeld or during storage. Chemical including the nutritional status of the crops or chemicals  such as fungicides  used in crop management could affect fungal populations, and consequently toxin production. The temperature and relative humidity range for optimal mycotoxin production may differ from that supporting fungal growth. In general, mycotoxins are optimally produced at 24 – 288C, but some toxins such as T-2 toxin is maximally produced at 158C.

During storage and transportation, water activity  aw , temperature, crop damage, time, blending with moldy components, and a number of physical and chemical factors, such as aeration  O2, CO2 levels , types of grains, pH, and presence or absence of speciﬁc nutrients and inhibitors are important.  3 NATURAL OCCURRENCE AND TOXIC  EFFECTS OF SELECTED MYCOTOXINS  3.1 Aﬂatoxins  3.1.1 General Considerations  Aﬂatoxins  AF , a group of polyketide-derived bisfurans containing dihydrofuranofuran and tetrahydroﬁnan  rings   Figure 1 Chemical structure of aﬂatoxins.  A  The B-type aﬂatoxins are characterized by a cyclopentane E-ring. These compounds have a blue ﬂuorescence under long-wavelength ultraviolet light.  B  The G-type aﬂatoxins, with a green ﬂuorescence, have a xanthone ring in place of the cyclopentane.  C  Aﬂatoxins of the B2 and G2 type have a saturated bis-furanyl ring. Only the bis-furan is shown.  D  Aﬂatoxin of the B1a and G1a type have a hydrated bis-furanyl structure.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   fused with substituted coumarin  Figure 1  are the most characterized class of mycotoxins  Cole and Cox 1981; Eaton and Groopman 1994 . At least 16 structurally related toxins in this group are produced by A. ﬂavus and A. parasiticus  Bhatnagar et al. 1992; 1993  and infrequently by A. pseudotamarii and A. nominus  Goto et al. 1996; Ito et al. 2001 . A. ochraceoroseus has also been found to produce aﬂatoxins  Klich et al. 2000 . The optimal temperatures and aw for the growth of A. ﬂavus and A. parasiticus are around 35 – 378C  range from 6 – 548C  and 0.95  range from 0.78 – 1.0 , respectively; whereas for aﬂatoxin production, they are 28 – 338C and 0.90 – 0.95  0.83 – 0.97 , respectively. Aﬂatoxin B1 is most toxic in this group and is one of the most potent naturally occurring carcinogens; other AFs are less toxic  B1 . G1 . B2 . G2 . Other signiﬁcant members of the aﬂatoxin family, such as M1 and M2, are metabolites of AFB1 and AFB2, respectively, and originally isolated from bovine milk [reviewed in Cary et al.  2000 ; Spahr et al.  1999 ].  The major steps and the corresponding genes of the AFB1 biosynthesis have been elucidated [extensively reviewed in Bhatnagar et al.  2003 ]. Starting with the polyketide precursor, acetate, there are at least 23 enzymatic steps in the AFB1 biosynthetic pathway. AFB2, G1, and G2 are synthesized from pathways that diverge from the B1 pathway. The genes for almost all the enzymes have been cloned and a regulatory gene  aﬂR  coding for a DNA-binding, Gal 4-type 47 kDa protein has been shown to be required for transcriptional activation of all the structural genes. A defect in aﬂR expression in the koji mold A. sojae causes to turn-off the expression of AF genes that produce AF  Matsushima et al. 2001 . It has also been shown by restriction mapping of cosmid and phage DNA libraries of A. ﬂavus and A. parasiticus that all the AFB1 pathway genes are clustered within a 75-kb region of the fungal genome  Bhatnagar et al. 2003 . G-protein signaling has recently been found to be involved in the biosynthesis of AF  Tag et al. 2000 .  3.1.2 Natural Occurrence  Aﬂatoxins have been found in corn, peanuts and peanut products, cotton seeds, peppers, rice, pistachios, tree nuts  Brazil nuts, almonds, pecans , pumpkin seeds, sunﬂower seeds and other oil seeds, copra, spices, and dried fruits  ﬁgs, raisins , and yams [see CAST  2003  for a detailed list]. Among these products, frequent contamination with high levels of AF in peanuts, corn, and cottonseed, mostly due to infestation with fungi in the ﬁeld, are of most concern. Soybeans, beans, pulses, cassava, sorghum, millet, wheat, oats, barley, and rice are resistant or only moderately susceptible to AF contamination in the ﬁeld. It should be reiterated that resistance to AF contamination in the ﬁeld does not guarantee that the commodities are free of AF contamination during storage. Inadequate storage conditions, such as high moisture and warm temperatures  25 – 308C , can create conditions favorable for the growth of fungus and production of AF.  3.1.3 Toxic Effects and Mode of Action  Aﬂatoxins are mutagenic, teratogenic, and hepatocarcino- genic in experimental animals [reviewed in Eaton and Groopman  1994 ]. Since AFB1 is one of the most potent naturally occurring carcinogen, extensive research was primarily done on this toxin. The main target organ of AF is the liver. Typical symptoms of aﬂatoxicoses in animals include proliferation of the bile duct, centrilobular necrosis, and fatty inﬁltration of the liver, generalized hepatic lesions, and hepatomas. AFB1 also affects other organs and tissues including the lungs and the entire respiratory system. The susceptibility of animals to AFB1 varies considerably with species in the following order: rabbits  most , ducklings, mink, cats, pigs, trout, dogs, guinea pigs, sheep, monkeys, chickens, the carcinogenic effects, rainbow trout, monkeys, and ducks are most susceptible and mice are relatively resistant. Consumption of AFB1-contaminated feed by dairy cows results in the excretion of AFM1 in milk. AFM1, a hydroxylated metabolite of AFB1, is about 10 times less toxic than AFB1; but its presence in milk is of concern for human health  Chu 2002 .  rats, mice, and hamsters   least . For  rats,  Metabolism plays a key role for the toxic action of aﬂatoxins. AFB1 must ﬁrst be activated by mixed-function oxidases to a putative short-lived AFB-8.9-exo-epoxide [reviewed in Eaton and Groopman  1994 ; Sinha and Bhatnagar  1998 ]. This intermediate can either be converted to hydroxylated metabolites, conjugated to glutathione or glucuronic acid etc; and then be excreted, or it can bind to DNA, RNA, and protein to exert its carcinogenic, mutagenic, and toxic effects. Glutathione S-transferase serves as a key enzyme in the detoxiﬁcation process for AFB1. Formation of AF dialdehyde by aldo-keto reductases and subsequent reaction with proteins also plays a role against AFB1 toxicity  Guengerich et al. 2001 . Adduct this intermediate with DNA occurs at the N-7 guanine position leading G-C to T-A or to A-T nucleotide substitutions, which results in defective repair and DNA damage, mutations and ultimately carcinomas in many animal species  Chu 2002; Eaton and Gallagher 1994; Wild and Hall 2000; Wogan 2000 . Aﬂatoxin-induced G:C mutations, both G to T and G to A, have been implicated in the inactivation of human p53 tumor suppressor gene at third position of codon 249; and the identiﬁcation of mutations inactivation of p53 at this site, has been used as a biomarker for AFB-induced liver cancers in humans  Groopman et al. 1995; Harris 1996 . Activated AFB1 and AFG1 also formed adducts with albumin  Skipper and Tannenbaum 1990  excreted in urine, which has been used as an index of human exposure to AFs  Sabbioni and Wild 1991; Turner et al. 2000 .  formation of  3.1.4  Impact on Human Health  Whereas AFB1 has been found to be a potent carcinogen in many animal species, the role of AF in carcinogenesis in humans is complicated by hepatitis B virus  HBV  infections  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   in humans  Hsieh 1989; Wild et al. 1992 . Epidemiological studies have shown a strong positive correlation between AF levels in the diet and primary hepatocellular carcinoma  PHC  incidence in some parts of the world, including certain regions of the People’s Republic of China, Kenya, Mozambique, Philippines, Swaziland, Thailand, and Transkei of South Africa [reviewed in Eaton and Groopman  1994 ]. Adducts of AF, i.e., AFB1-DNA and AF-albumin as well as several AF metabolites, mainly AFM1 have been detected in serum, milk, and urine of humans in these regions. However, the prevalence of HBV infection is also correlated to liver cancer incidence in these regions. Since multiple factors are important in carcinogenesis  Wogan 2000  and environmental contaminants such as AFs and other mycotoxins may, either in combination with HBV or independently, be important etiological factors. Recent data on the enhancement of mutation of p53 gene suggest the synergistic effect of these two risk factors for PHC in humans  Jackson et al. 2001; Smela et al. 2001 .  3.2 Ochratoxins  3.2.1 General Considerations  frequently in nature. Other  Ochratoxins, a group of dihydroisocoumarin-containing mycotoxins  Figure 2 , are produced by a number of fungi in the genera Aspergillus and Penicillium [reviewed in Bhatnagar et al. 2002; Chu 2002; Ono et al. 1995; Petzinger and Ziegler 2000 . The largest amounts ochratoxins are made by A. ochraceus and P. cyclopium. A. ochraceus and P. viridicatum  reclassiﬁed as P. verrucosum , two species that were ﬁrst reported as ochratoxin A  OA  producers, occur most fungi, such as Petromyces alliceus, A. citricus, and A. fonsecaeus  both in A. niger group , have also been found to produce OA. Most of the OA producers are storage fungi and preharvest fungal infection and OA production is not a serious problem. Although most OA producers can grow in a range from 48C to 378C and at aw as low as 0.78, optimal conditions for toxin production are narrower with temperature at 24 – 258C and aw values . 0.97  minimum aw for OA production is about 0.85 . Ochratoxins are produced primarily in cereal grains  barley, oats, rye, corn, wheat  and mixed feed during storage in temperate climatic conditions, with levels higher than 1 ppm being reported. OA has been found in other commodities, including beans, coffee, nuts, olives, raisin, cheese, ﬁsh, pork, milk powder, fruit juices wine  Filali et al. 2001; Pietri et al. 2001 , beer, peppers  Thirumala et al. 2001 , and bread  Van Egmond and Speijers 1994 . OA can be carried through the food chain because of the presence of OA residues in animal products as result of its binding with serum albumin. Natural occurrence of OA in kidneys, blood serum, blood sausage, and other sausage made from pork has been reported [reviewed in CAST  2003 ].  Figure 2 Structure of the ochratoxins. These metabolites form different classes depending on the nature of the amide group  a – c , and the presence or absence of a chlorine moiety at R2 in the phenyl group.  3.2.2 Toxicological Effects and Mode of Action  the most  Ochratoxin A, toxic member of this group of mycotoxins, has been found to be a potent nephrotoxin causing kidney damage as well as liver necrosis and enteritis in many animal species [reviewed in Bhatnagar et al. 2002; Chu 2002 . Although OA is primarily considered a weak nephro-carcinogen because a high level of toxin and an extended period of exposure are necessary to induce the tumors, it also causes liver tumors in rats  Boorman et al. 1992; Schlatter et al. 1996 . The OA is also an immunosuppessor  Bondy and Pestka 2000; Boorman et al. 1992; Simon 1996  and has teratogenic, mutagenic, weak genotoxic properties  Dirheimer 1996; deGroene et al. 1996 . Several mechanisms have been postulated for the mode of action for OA  Chu 2002 . Whereas OA – DNA adducts have been found in kidney, liver, and several other organs of mice and rats, their structures and functions have not been deﬁned  Grosse et al. 1995; Pfohl-Leszkowicz et al. 1993 . Formation of a reactive intermediate such as of those for AFB1 is less  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   likely to be involved in the action of OA  Gautier et al. 2001a, b; Zepnik et al. 2001 . The OA inhibits carboxypeptidase A, renal phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, phenylalanine- tRNA synthetase, and phenylalanine hydroxylase activity. Formation of free radicals has been considered as one of the mechanisms for the carcinogenic toxic effects of OA  Baudrimont et al. 1994; Gautier et al. 2001a; Hoehler and Marquardt 1996; Rahimtula et al. 1988 . Studies on the OA induced apoptosis revealed that interacts with distinct members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, e.g., c-jun amino-terminal-kinase, which can lead to direct or indirect caspase 3 activation and subsequently to APT  Gekle et al. 2000; Schwerdt et al. 1999 . OA may impair cellular Ca2þ cAMP homeostasis. In the renal epithelial cells, OA interferes with hormonal Ca2þ signaling, leading to altered cell proliferation.  it  3.2.3 OA and Human Health  Although the role of ochratoxins in human pathogenesis is still speculative, the pathological lesions of nephropathy in humans were reported to be similar to those observed in porcine nephropathy  Krogh 1976 . Outbreaks of kidney disease  Balkan endemic nephropathy  in rural populations in Bulgaria, Romania, Tunisia, and the former Yugoslavia has been associated with OA  Maarouﬁ et al. 1996; Wolff et al. 2000 .  3.3 Fumonisins  3.3.1 General Considerations  Fumonisins  Fm  are a group of toxic metabolites produced primarily by F. verticillioides, F. proliferatum and other related species readily colonize corn all over the world  Dutton 1996; Jackson et al. 1996; Marasas 2001 . Although F. anthophilum, F. nupiforme, and F. nygamai are capable of producing Fms, they are not commonly isolated from food and feed. Other related fusaria, including F. subglutinans, F. annulatum, F. succisae, and F. beomiforme, are not Fm producers  Nelson et al. 1993 . More than 11 structurally related Fms  B1, B2, B3, B4, C1, C4, A1, A2, etc. , have been found since the discovery of FmB1  diester of propane-1,2,3-tricarboxylic acid of 2 amino-12, 16-dimethyl- 3,5,10,14,15-pentahydroxyicosane  in 1987  Figure 3  [reviewed in Bhatnagar et al.  2002 ; Chu  2002 ]. Several hydrolyzed derivatives of Fms, resulting from removal of the tricarballylic acid and other ester groups, have also been found in nature. Fumonisins are chemically similar in structure to toxins  AAL  produced by A. alternata. furnonisins by Alternaria has also been Production of reported, and some fumonisin-producing Fusaria have been known to produce AAL toxins.  Fumonisins are most frequently found in corn, corn-based foods, and other grains  such as sorghum and rice  but peanuts and soybeans are poor substrate. The level of contamination varies considerably with different regions and year, ranging  Figure 3 Chemical structures of different classes of fumoni- sins. The R residue is 3-hydroxypidinium in fumonisins, B1 – B3 while the others are tricarballyl esters.  from negligible to more than 100 ppm; but is generally reported to be between 1 and 2 ppm. FmB1 is the most common Fm in naturally contaminated samples; FmB2 generally accounts for 1 3 or less of the total. Although production of the toxin generally occurs in the ﬁeld, continued production of toxin during postharvest storage also con- tributes to the overall levels.  Chu 2001; 2002; 2001 May issues of Environmental Health Prospective, Vol. 109 .  The biosynthesis of the 20-carbon chain backbone of Fms resembles those for fatty acids and linear polyketides [reviewed in Desjardins et al. 1996; Proctor 2000 . Five loci  designated as fum 1, fum 2, fum 3, and fum 4 and fum 5  have been identiﬁed by classical genetic analyses utilizing Gibberella fuijikuroi, the sexual stage of F. moniﬁforme  Proctor 2000 . At least 15 genes are associated with the fumonisin production and these genes are clustered together on chromosone “1”  Proctor 2000; Xu and Leslie 1996  including a polyketide synthase gene   fum5 . Gene Fum2 and Fum3 are associated with the interconversion of different fumonisins  Proctor 2000 .  3.3.2 Toxicologic Effects  Fumonisin B1 is primarily a hepatotoxin and carcinogen in rats  Class 2B carcinogen . Feeding culture material from  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   F. verticillioides or pure FmB1 to rats resulted in cirrhosis and hepatic nodules, adenoﬁbrosis, hepatocellular carcinoma- ductular carcinoma, and cholangiocarcinoma  Gelderblom et al. 2001; Haschek et al. 2001 . Kidney is also a target organ, and tubular nephrosis was found both in rats and in horses of ﬁeld cases associated with equine leukoencephalomalacia  ELEM . In addition to FmB1, which was originally found to be a potent cancer-causing agent, FmB2 and FmB3 have also been found to be carcinogens and have cancer initiation and promoting activities in rats. The effective dose of FmB1 for cancer initiation in rat liver depends both on the levels and on the duration of exposure. In cell culture systems, FmB1 has been demonstrated to be mitogenic and cytotoxic, without genotoxic effects  Gelderblom et al. 2001 . Kidney cells have also been shown to be targeted by these toxins.  Fumonisin B1 was identiﬁed as an etiological agent responsible for ELEM in horses and other Equidae  donkeys and ponies  and for porcine pulmonary edema  PPE  [Jackson et al. 1996; reviewed in Summerell et al.  2001 ]. ELEM is characterized primarily by neurotoxic effects, including uncoordinated movements and apparent blindness showing as violent blundering into stalls and walls. The levels of FmB1 and FmB2 in feeds associated with conﬁrmed cases of ELEM ranged from 1.3 to 27 ppm. In pigs, PPE occurs only at high FmB levels  175 ppm , while liver damage occurs at much lower concentrations with a NOAEL of , 12 ppm. FmB1 resulting in left-sided heart failure alters cardio- vascular function. In the cattle, renal injury, hepatic lesions, and alteration of sphingolipid in various organs was observed  Haschek et al. 2001 . Similar to AAL toxin, Fms are also  Figure 4 Chemical structure of different trichothecenes. MC ¼ Macrocyclic; ISV ¼ isovalerate; OH-ISV ¼ hydroxyisovalerate.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   toxic to some plants such as, jimsonweed, black nightshade, duckweed, and tomatoes  Abbas and Riley 1996 .  3.3.3 Mode of Action  regulation,  Mechanistically, Fms are inhibitors of ceramide synthase  sphinganine sphingosine N-acyltransferase , a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of sphingolipids, which are heavily involved in cellular including cell differentiation, mitogenesis and apoptosis  Merrill et al. 2001; Riley et al. 2001 . The primary amino group of Fms is essential for its inhibitory and toxic effects  Norred et al. 2001 . The inhibitory effect of Fms on ceramide synthase appears to be related to interference with sphingolipid biosynthesis in multiple organs, such as brain, lung, liver, and kidney of the susceptible animals  Garren et al. 2001 . Increased lipid peroxidation has also been considered as a mode for its effect on initiation of cancer  Gelderblom et al. 2001 . The mode of action of FmB becomes more clear from recent data of its effects on apoptosis  Zhang et al. 2001  and the tumor necrosis factor  TNF  pathway is important in inducing tumors  He et al. 2001; Zhang et al. 2001; Sharma et al. 2001 , but the tumor suppressor gene p53 was not required  Jones et al. 2001 . The ability of FmB1 to alter gene expression and signal transduction pathways are considered necessary for its carcinogenic and toxic effects. FmB1 is a good example of an apparently nongenotoxic  non-DNA reactive  agent producing tumors through the regulation of apoptosis  Dragan et al. 2001 .  3.3.4  Impact on Human and Animal Health  While Fms are commonly detected in corn-based foods and feeds, the impact of low levels of Fms in human foods is not clear. Although several reports have indicated a possible role of FmB1 in the etiology of human esophageal cancer in the regions of South Africa, China, and northeastern Italy where Fusarium species are common contaminants, more data are necessary to sustain this hypothesis  Groves et al. 1999 . The co-occurrence of Fms with carcinogenic mycoroxins such as AFB  da-Silva et al. 2000; Vargas et al. 2001  or nitrosamines may play an important role in carcinogenesis in humans. Current data suggest that Fms may have greater effect on the health of farm animals than on humans [Bhatnagar et al.  2002  for review].  3.4 Selected Trichothecenes  TCTCs   3.4.1 General Considerations  Several species of Fusaria infect corn, wheat, barley, and rice. Under favorable conditions, they elaborate a number of different types of tetracyclic sesquiterpenoid mycotoxins that are composed of the epoxytrichothecene skeleton and an oleﬁnic bond with different side chain substitutions  Figure 4 . Based on the presence of a macrocyclic ester or ester – ether bridge between C-4 and C-15, trichothecenes  TCTCs  are  generally classiﬁed as macrocyclic  Type C  or nonmacro- cyclic  Types A and B   Figure 4 . Although more than 100 TCTCs have been identiﬁed, only a few frequently found in foods and feeds are potentially hazardous to human and fungal genera are Myrothecium, animal health. Other Trichoderma, Trichothecium, Cephalosporium, Verticimono- sporium, and Stachybotrys. In addition to fungi, extracts from a Brazilian shrub, Baccharis megapotamica, also contain macrocyclic TCTCs. The term TCTCs is derived from trichothecin, the ﬁrst compound isolated in this group  Chu 1997; Jarvis et al. 1995; Miller and Trenholm 1994; Vesonder and Golinski 1989 .  Similar to other sesquiterpenes, TCTCs are biosynthesized via the mevalonate pathway: the TCTC skeleton is formed by cyclization of farnesyl pyrophosphate via the intermediate trichodiene by an enzyme trichodiene synthase. The isovaleroxy side chain in T-2 toxin is derived from leucine. Several key enzymes in the TCTC biosynthetic pathway have been identiﬁed. At least six genes  Tri1 to Tri6  involved in the biosynthesis of these mycotoxins have been cloned, and these genes are clustered together on a chromosome. Genes Tri3, Tri4, and Tri5, which encode a transacetylase  15-O-acetyltransferase , a cytochrome P-450 monooxy- genase, and trichodiene synthase, respectively, are contained within a 9-kb region, while Tri5 and Tri6  a regulatory gene  are in a 5.7 kb region  Proctor 2000 .  in animals and humans  The structural diversity of TCTCs results in a variety of toxic effects [reviewed in Bhatnagar et al.  2002 ]. The TCTC mycotoxicoses affect many organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, hemato- poietic, nervous, immune, hepatobiliary, and cardiovascular systems. Outbreaks of several types of mycotoxicoses in including moldy corn toxicosis, humans and animals, red-mold, or akakbi-byo scabby wheat disease, or scabby barley poisoning , feed refusal and emetic syndrome  swine , fusaritoxicoses, hemorrhagic syndrome, and alimentary toxic aleukia  ATA  have been reported. Mechanistically, inhibition of protein synthesis is one of the earlier events in manifestation of TCTC toxic effects and they act at different steps in the translation process. these mycotoxins vary considerably with the chemical the side chain [see review in Chu  2002 ].  Inhibitory effects of  structure of  toxicosis   or  3.4.2 T-2 Toxin and Related Type A TCTCs  T-2 toxin, a highly toxic type A TCTC, is produced by F. tricinctum, F. sporotrichioides  major , F. poae, F. sulphureum, F. acuminatum, and F. sambucinum. Unlike most mycotoxins, which are usually synthesized near 258C, the optimal temperature for T-2 toxin production is around 158C. Higher temperatures  20 – 258C  are needed for the production of related metabolites, such as H-T2 toxin. Although T-2 toxin occurs naturally in cereal grains, including barley, corn, corn stalk, oats, wheat, and mixed feeds, contamination with T-2 toxin is less frequent than with deoxynivalenol  DON . However, T-2 toxin  LD50 in  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   mice: 2–4 mg kg mice  is much more toxic to animals, perhaps also to humans, than DON  LD50 in mice: 50–70 mg kg .  Almost all the major TCTCs, including T-2 toxin, are cytotoxic and cause hemorrhage, edema, and necrosis of skin tissues. Inﬂammatory reactions near the nose and mouth of animals are similar to some lesions found in humans suffering from ATA disease. The severity of lesions is also related to chemical structure. Compared with other types of TCTCs, group A toxins  T-2 toxin  are less toxic than macrocyclic toxins but more toxic than type B toxins. Neurologic dysfunctions, including emesis, tachycardia, diarrhea, refusal of feed anorexia, and depression have also been observed. T-2 toxin and some TCTCs also induce pathological lesions in the gastrointestinal system. However, the major lesion of T-2 toxin is its devastating effect on the hematopoietic system in many mammals, including humans. T-2 toxin and related TCTCs are the most potent immunosuppressants of the known mycotoxins and cause signiﬁcant lesions in lymph nodes, spleens, thymus, and the bursa of Fabricius  Bondy and Pestka 2000 . The heart and pancreas are other target organs for T-2 toxin intoxication. Urinary and hepatobiliary lesions induced by T-2 toxin and DAS are secondary.  3.4.3 Deoxynivalenol  DON   The DON is a major type B TCTC mycotoxin produced by F. graminearum  major  and other related fungi such as F. culmorum and F. crookwellense. Because DON causes feed refusal and emesis in swine, the name “vomitoxin” is also used for this mycotoxin. Although DON is considerably less toxic than most other TCTC mycotoxins, the level of contamination of this toxin in corn and wheat is generally high, usually above 1 ppm, sometimes greater than 20 ppm. Contamination of DON in other commodities, including barley, oats, sorghum, rye, safﬂower seeds, and mixed feeds has also been reported. Worldwide frequent natural occurrence of DON in cereal grains has been reported  Miller and Trenholm 1994 . Although inadequate storage may lead to the production of some TCTC mycotoxins, infestation of fusaria in wheat and corn in the ﬁeld is of most concern for the DON problem. With wet and cold weather during maturation, grains are especially susceptible to F. graminearum infection, which causes so-called “scabby wheat” and simultaneously produces the toxin. The optimal temperature for DON production is about 248C. Outbreaks of DON in winter wheat in the United States, Finland, and Canada usually occur when continental chilly and humid weather favoring the fungal infection is followed by a humid summer favorable for toxin production.  Toxicologically, DON induces anorexia and emesis both in humans and animals [reviewed in Bhatnagar et al.  2002 ; Chu  2002 ]. Swine are most sensitive to feed contaminated with DON. Whereas most TCTCs are immunosuppressors, DON is a hyperinducer of cytokines and IgA. Induction of expression of mRNA of Ils-2, 4, 5, 6 in a T-cell model EL4.IL-2 by DON was found at levels required for partial or maximal protein synthesis inhibition. A single oral gavage  with DON was sufﬁcient to induce these mRNA levels in Peyer’s patches and spleen  Bondy and Pestka 2000 .  3.4.4 The Impact of TCTC on Human and Animal  Health  Because of their toxicity and their frequent presence in foods and feeds, TCTCs are potentially hazardous to human and animal health. Among the many types of TCTC myco- toxicoses, only ATA and scabby wheat toxicosis have been demonstrated in human populations. ATA, which has symptoms including skin inﬂammation, vomiting, damage to hematopoietic tissues, leukocytosis, and leukopenia, was attributed to the consumption of overwintered cereal grains colonized by F. sporotrichioides and F. poae; it caused the deaths of hundreds of people in the USSR between 1942 and 1947  Ueno 1986 . TCTCs may also be involved in the so-called “sick building syndrome  SBS ” in humans  Mahmoudi and Gershwin 2000; Vesper et al. 2000 . S. atra and S. chartarum were isolated from a badly water-damaged home or building where the occupants complained about headaches, sore throats, hair loss, ﬂu symptoms, diarrhea, fatigue, dermatitis, and general malaise as well as pulmonary hemorrhage cases. Several TCTCs were found in these cases, but other molds and mycotoxins were also found in the mold damaged buildings  Toumi et al. 1993 .  3.5 Other Selected Mycotoxins  In addition to the mycotoxins discussed above, a number of other mycotoxins occur naturally. The impacts of some of these mycotoxins on human and animal health are discussed in the following sections.  3.5.1 Other Mycotoxins Produced by Aspergillus  Sterigmatocystin  ST  is a naturally occurring hepatotoxic and carcinogenic mycotoxin produced by fungi in the genera Aspergillus, Bipolaris, and Chaetomium as well as P. luteum [see Bhatnagar et al.  2002 ]. Structurally related to AFB1  Figure 5 , ST is known to be a precursor of AFB1  Bhatnagar  Figure 5 Structure of sterigmatocystin. The bis-furanyl structure is similar to that of the aﬂatoxins except that the E-ring is a substituted phenol.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   et al. 2003 . Although the carcinogenicity of ST is less  10 – 100 times  than that of AFB1 in test animals  van der Watt 1977 , ST is a mutagen and genotoxin and has been found in cereal grains  barley, rice, and corn , coffee beans, and cheese  Chu 2002 . A. terreus and several other fungi  e.g., A. ﬂavus and A. fumigatus and some Penicillia  have been found to produce the tremorgenic toxins, territrems, aﬂatrem, and fumitremorgin. These mycotoxins contain both the indole ring of tryptophan and a dioxopiperazine ring formed by condensation of two amino acids. A. terreus, A. fumigatus, and Trichoderma viride also produce gliotoxin, an epipolythiopiperazines -3,6-diones-sulfur containing piperazine antibiotic, that may have immunosuppressive effects in animals  Waring and Beaver 1996 . In addition, A. ﬂavus, A. wentii, A. oryzae, and P. atraovenetum are capable of producing nitropropionic acid  NPA , a mycotoxin causing apnea, convulsions, congestion in lungs and subcutaneous vessels, and liver damage in test animals  Burdock et al. 2001 . Production of NPA in sugarcanes by Arthrinium sacchari, Arth. saccharicola, and Arth. phaeo- spermum has been found to be involved in fatal food poisoning in humans  Liu et al. 1988 .  3.5.2 Other Mycotoxins Produced by Penicillium  Other than OA, Penicillia produce many mycotoxins with diverse toxic effects. Cyclochlorotine, luteoskyrin  LS , and rugulosin  RS  have long been considered to be possibly involved in the yellow rice disease during the Second World War. They are hepatotoxins and also produce hepatomas in test animals. However, incidents of food contamination with these toxins have not been well documented. Several other mycotoxins, including patulin  PT, Figure 6 , penicillic acid  PA, Figure 7 , citrinin  CT , cyclopiazonic acid  CPA, Figure 8 , citreoviridin, and xanthomegnin, which are produced primarily by several species of Penicillia, have attracted some attention because of their frequent occurrence in foods. PT and PA are produced by many species in the genera Aspergillus and Penicillium. Byssochlamys nivea also produces PT  Tournas 1994 . Both toxins are hepatotoxic and  teratogenic. Patulin is frequently found in damaged apples, apple juice, apple cider and sometimes in other fruit juices and feed. PA has been detected in “blue eye corn” beans and meat. Due to its highly reactive double bonds that readily react with sulfhydryl groups in foods, patulin is not very stable in foods containing these groups  Scott 1975 . As a hepatotoxin but not known as a carcinogen, PT is considered a health hazard to humans  CAST 2003 .  Frequently associated with the natural occurrence of OA, citrinin, also a nephrotoxin, is produced by P. citrinum and several other penicillia, aspergilli  Cole and Cox 1981  and Monocuus ruber and M. purpureus  Pastrana et al. 1996 . The presence of citrinin in the diet with low quality corn could lead to chronic, hard to diagnose kidney disease in susceptible individuals and animals  CAST 2003 . One of the mycotoxins closely associated with the natural occurrence of AF in peanuts is CPA, which causes hyperesthesia and convulsions as well as liver, spleen, pancreas, kidney, salivary gland, and myocardial damage  CAST 2003 . CPA inhibits the calcium- dependent ATPase  Chu 2002; Petr et al. 1999 . The toxin is the genus Penicillium, produced by several species of including P. cyclopium, P. crustosum, P. griseofulvin, P. puberulum, P. camemberti, and Aspergilli including A. versicolor, A. ﬂavus but not by A. parasiticus and A. tamarii [in Bhatnagar et al.  2002 ]. Other than peanuts, CPA has been found in corn, cheese and fermented meat sausage, and sometimes along with aﬂatoxin  Fernandez-Pinto et al. 2001; Lopez-Diaz et al. 2001 .  Penicillium rubrum and P. purpurogenum produce two highly toxic hepatotoxins  LD50, 3.0 mg kg mice, IP  called rubratoxins A  RA, minor  and B  RB, major , which are complex nonadrides fused with anhydrides and lactone rings. Rubratoxin B has synergistic effects with AFB1  CAST 2003 . In addition, penicillia produce many neurotoxic mycotoxins. In many cases these mycotoxins do not cause noticeable toxicity, but in some cases have strong tremorgenic activity. Animals will also refuse food, and will have lowered resistance to disease. For example, P. crustosum and P. cyclopium produce tremorgenic indolediterpenes called penitrems A-F. Penitrem A, the major toxin in this group, causes tremorgenic effects in mice. Roquefortines A-C  C is  Figure 6 Structure of patulin showing the closed-ring tautomeric form.  Figure 7 Chemical structure of penicillic acid showing both tautomeric forms. The open-chain form is in equilibrium with the closed form shown on the right in the ﬁgure.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

Fusarium verticillioides and related species, in addition to Fms, also produce several other mycotoxins, including fusarins A-F, moniliformin, fusarioic, and fusaric acid, fusaproliferin and beauvericin  CAST 2003; Chu 2002 . Although the impact of these mycotoxins on human health is still not known, fusarin C  FC  has been identiﬁed as a potent mutagen and is also produced by F. subglutinans, F. graminearium and several other Fusaria. Moniliformin, which causes cardiomyopathy in test animals, may be involved in the Keshan disease in humans in regions where dietary selenium deﬁciency is also a problem  Liu 1996 . In comparing their ability to form DNA-adducts, beauvericin forms a more stable complex with DNA than fusaproliferin  Pocsfalvi et al. 2000 . Among many fungi, F. verticilioides is also most capable of reducing nitrates to form potent carcinogenic nitrosamines. These observations further suggest that the contamination of foods with this fungus could be one of the etiological factors involved in human carcinogenesis in certain regions of the world.  3.5.4 Mycotoxins Produced by Alternaria Species  tetramic acids,  Alternaria has been known for centuries to cause various plant diseases. Species of this fungus are widely distributed in soil and on aerial plant parts. More than 20 species of Alternaria are known to produce about 70 secondary metabolites belonging to a diverse chemical group, including dibenzo-[a]-pyrones, lactones, quinones, cyclic peptides. However, only alternariol  Figure 10 , tenuazonic acid, altertoxin-I, alternariol monomethyl ether  AME , altenuene are common contaminants in consumable items like fruits  apples , vegetables  tomato , cereals  sorghum, barely, oat , and other plant parts  such as leaves   Jelinek et al. 1989 . Natural occurrence of isoaltenuene, altenuisol, altertoxins II and III  also called stemphyltoxin  are less common. The most common species of Alternaria, A. alternata  formerly known as A. kikuchiana  produces all important Alternaria toxins including the ﬁve mentioned above and tentoxin, alteniusol, alternaric acid, altenusin, dehydroaltenusin  Bottalico and Logrieco 1998; Chelkowski  Figure 8 Chemical structure of cyclopiazonic acid.  most toxic , which are produced by P. roqueforti and several other penicillia, have neurotoxic effects in animals and have been found in cheese. Tremorgens in the paspalitrem group  paspalicine, paspalinine, paspalitrem A and B, paspaline and paxilline  are produced by C. paspali and some penicillia  Plumlee and Galey 1994; Steyn 1995; Yamaguchi et al. 1993 .  3.5.3 Other Mycotoxins Produced by Fusarium  Some fusaria are capable of producing mycotoxins other than TCTCs and Fm. Zearalenone  ZE   Figure 9  [6- 10-hydroxy- 6-oxo-trans-1-undecenyl -b beta -resorcyclic acid lactone], a mycotoxin produced by the scabby wheat fungus, F. graminearum  roseum , is of most concern. Also called F-2, ZE is a phytoestrogen causing hyperestrogenic effects and reproductive problems such as premature onset of puberty in female animals, especially swine. ZE has been shown to bind with the estrogen and steroid receptors, and stimulates protein synthesis by mimicking hormonal action  Zepnik et al. 2001 . Zearalenone can be toxic to plants; it can inhibit seed germination and embryo growth at low concentrations. Natural contamination with ZE primarily occurs in cereal grains such as corn and wheat. Contamination of feed with ZE  Figure 9 Stucture of zearalenone.  Figure 10 Structure of alternariol.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   1992 . As mentioned previously, A. alternata f sp. lycopersici produces a group of host-speciﬁc toxins named AAL toxins with structure and functions similar to Fms. Although most of the compounds produced by Alternaria are generally nontoxic, AME has been shown to be mutagenic in Ames test  Woody and Chu 1992 . Tenuazonic acid is a protein synthesis inhibitor and is capable of chelating metal ions and forming nitrosamines. This mycotoxin is also produced by Phoma sorghina and Pyricularia oryzae and may be related to “Onyalai,” a hematological disorder in humans living south of the Sahara in Africa.  3.5.5 Mycotoxins Produced by Other Fungi  Sporidesmines, a group of hepatotoxins discovered in the 1960s, are also worthy of mention. These mycotoxins, causing facial eczema in animals, are produced by Pithomyces chartarum and Sporidesmium chartarum and are very important economically to the sheep industry. Slaframine, a signiﬁcant mycotoxin produced by Rhizoctonia leguminicola  in infested legume forage crops , causes excessive salivation or slobbering in ruminants as a result of blocking acetylcholine receptor sites  CAST 2003 .  4 PREVENTIVE MEASURES  4.1 Management of Mycotoxin Contamination  The economic implications of the mycotoxin problem and its potential health threat to humans have clearly created a need to eliminate or at least minimize mycotoxin contamination of food and feed. While an association between mycotoxin contamination and inadequate storage conditions has long been recognized, studies have revealed that seeds are contaminated with mycotoxins prior to harvest  Lisker and Lillehoj 1991 . Therefore, management of mycotoxin contamination in commodities must include both pre- and postharvest control measures  CAST 2003 .  4.1.1 Preharvest Control  Mycotoxin contamination can be reduced somewhat by using of resistant varieties  most effective, but not all are successful  and earlier harvest varieties, crop rotation, adequate irrigation, control of insect pests, etc [reviewed in Bacon et al.  2001 ; Chen et al.  2002 ; Duvick  2001 ; Sinha and Bhatnagar  1998 ]. Signiﬁcant control of toxin contami- nation is expected to be dependent on a detailed under- standing of the physiological and environmental factors that affect the biosynthesis of the toxin, the biology and ecology of the fungus, and the parameters of the host plant – fungal interactions. Efforts are underway to study these parameters primarily for toxins, namely AFs, Fms, and TCTCs [reviewed in Brown et al.  1998 ; Duvick  2001 ; Sinha and Bhatnagar  1988 ].  the most agriculturally signiﬁcant  Use of atoxigenic biocompetitive, native A. ﬂavus strains to out-compete the toxigenic isolates has been effective in signiﬁcantly reducing preharvest contamination with aﬂa- toxin in cotton and peanuts  Cotty and Bhatnagar 1994; Dorner et al. 1992 . However, the aﬂatoxin contamination process is so complex  Payne 1998  that a combination of approaches will be required to eliminate or even control the preharvest toxin contamination problem  Bhatnagar et al. 1995 .  4.1.2 Postharvest Control  After harvest, crop should not be allowed to overwinter in the ﬁeld as well as subjected to bird and insect damage or mechanical damage. Grains should be cleaned and dried quickly to less than 10 – 13% moisture and stored in a clean area to avoid insect and rodent infestation  Trenholm et al. 1988 . Postharvest mycotoxin contamination is prevalent in most tropical countries due to a hot, wet climate coupled with subadequate methods of harvesting, handling, and storage practices, which often lead to severe fungal growth and mycotoxin contamination of food and feed  Birzele et al. 2000; Phillips et al. 1994 . Sometimes contaminated food has been diverted to animal feed to prevent economic losses and health concerns. However, this is not a solution to the contamination problem. Irradiation has been suggested as a possible means of controlling insect and microbial popu- lations in stored food, and consequently, reducing the hazard of mycotoxin production under these conditions [reviewed in Sharma  1998 ]. Signiﬁcant emphasis has been placed on detoxiﬁcation methods to eliminate the toxins from the contaminated lots or at least reduce the toxin hazards by bringing down the mycotoxin levels under the acceptable limits.  a. Removal or Elimination of Mycotoxins. Since most of the mycotoxin burden in contaminated commodities is localized to a relatively small number or seeds or kernels [reviewed in Dickens  1977 ], removal of these contaminated seeds kernels is effective in detoxifying the commodity. Methods currently used include:  a  physical separation by identiﬁcation and removal of damaged seed; mechanical or electronic sorting; ﬂotation and density separation of damaged or contaminated seed; physical screening and subsequent removal of damaged kernels by air blowing; washing with water or use of speciﬁc gravity methods have shown some effect for some mycotoxins, including DON, FmB, and AFB1  Trenholm et al. 1992 ,  b  removal by ﬁltration and adsorption onto ﬁlter pads, clays, activated charcoal, etc.,  c  removal of the toxin by milling processes,  d  removal of the mycotoxin by solvent extraction  CAST 2003; DeVries et al. 2002 .  b. Inactivation of Mycotoxins. When removal or elimin- ation of mycotoxins is not possible, mycotoxins can be inactivated by  a  physical methods such as thermal inactivation, photochemical or gamma irradiation,  b   Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   chemical methods such a treatment of commodities with acids, alkalies, aldehydes, oxidizing agents, and gases like chlorine, sulfur dioxide, NaNO2, ozone and ammonia,  c  biological methods such as fermentations and enzymatic digestion that cause the breakdown of mycotoxins. The commercial application of some of these detoxifying mechanisms is not feasible because, in a number of cases, the methods will be limited by factors such as the toxicity of the detoxifying agent, nutritional or aesthetic losses of commodities during treatment, and the cost of the sophisticated treatment [reviewed in Sinha and Bhatnagar 1998]. Although several detoxiﬁcation methods have been established for aﬂatoxins, only the ammoniation process is an effective and practical method  Piva et al. 1995 . Other chemicals such as ozone, chlorine, and bisulﬁte have been tested and some effect for some mycotoxins was shown in it  Doyle et al. 1982 . Solvent extractions have been shown to be effective but are not economically feasible.  Food  of Mycotoxins During  c. Removal Pro- cessing. While cooking generally does not destroy myco- toxins, some mycotoxins can be detoxiﬁed or removed by certain kinds of food processing. For example, extrusion cooking appears to be effective for detoxifying DON but not AFB. FmB1 can form Schiff’s bases with reducing sugars such as fructose under certain conditions  Murphy et al. 1995  and lose its hepato-carcinogenicity  Liu et al. 2001 ; but the hydrolyzed FmB1 was found to be still toxic  Voss et al. 1996 . Loss of FmB1 occurs during extrusion and baking of corn-base foods with sugars and nixtamalization  alkaline cooking  and rinsing in the preparation of tortilla chip and masa  Dombrink-Kurtzman et al. 2000; Voss et al. 2001 . PT can be removed from apple juice by treatment with certain types of active carbons  Leggott et al. 2001 . The effect of food processing on various mycotoxins has been recently reviewed by several authors in an ACS symposium  DeVries et al. 2002 .  4.2 Avoiding Human Exposure  4.2.1 Role of Rigorous Monitoring Programs  While it is impossible to remove mycotoxins completely from foods and feeds, effective measures to decrease the risk of exposure depend on a rigorous program of monitoring mycotoxins in foods and feeds. Consequently, governments in many countries have set limits for permissible levels or tolerance levels for a number of mycotoxins in foods and feeds. Over 50 countries of the world have developed such guidelines  Van Egmond 2002 . For example, levels varying from zero tolerance to 50 ppb have been set for total AFs. Other than AFs, a tolerance level of 1 ppm for DON in grains for human consumption has been set by a number of countries, including the United States. The FmB1 levels established by FDA in 2000 are limited to 5, 20, 60 100, 30, and 10 ppm, in corn and corn by-products to be used for horse and rabbit, catﬁsh and swine, ruminants and mink, poultry,  breeding stock  ruminant, poultry, and mink , and others  dogs and cats , respectively. Among 77 countries which have regulations for different mycotoxins, eight have speciﬁc regulations for OA, with limits ranging from 1 to 20 mg kg in different foods. Regulatory guidelines to limit the presence of PT to 50 mg kg in various foods and juices have been established by at least ten countries worldwide. Details on worldwide regulatory issues and permissive levels of mycotoxins in foods and feeds have appeared in a number of recent reviews  Park and Troxell 2002; Van Egmond 2002; Chu 2002 .  4.2.2 Detection and Screening of Mycotoxins  Because of the diverse chemical structures of mycotoxins, the presence of trace amounts of toxins in very complicated interfere with analysis, and the uneven matrices that distribution of the toxins in the sample, analysis of mycotoxins is a difﬁcult task  Chu 1995; Coker 1998; Richard et al. 1993; Wilson et al. 1998 . Because many steps are involved in the analysis, it is not uncommon that the analytical error can amount to 20 – 30%  Horwitz et al. 1993 . To obtain reliable analytical data, an adequate sampling program and an accurate analytical method are both important  Whitaker et al. 1994; 1995; Wilson et al. 1998 . To minimize the errors, studies have led to many improved and innovative analytical methods for mycotoxin analysis over the years  Chu 1991; Gilbert 1999; Maragos 1997 . New, more sensitive TLC, HPLC, and GC techniques are now available. Sensitive and versatile high resolution MS and GC tandem MS MS are coming to the market. The MS methods have also been incorporated into HPLC systems. New chemical methods, including capillary electrophoresis and biosensors are emerging and have gained application for mycotoxin analysis  Maragos 1997 .  After a number of years of research, immunoassays have gained wide acceptance as analytical tools for mycotoxins in the last decade  Chu 2001 . Antibodies against almost all the mycotoxins are now available. Some quantitative and qualitative immunoassays have been approved as AOAC methods. Many immunoscreening kits, which require less than 15 min. per test, are commercially available  Trucksess and Wood 1997 . Rather than analysis of toxin, PCR methods, based on the primers of key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of mycotoxins, have been introduced for the determination of toxicogenic fungi present in foods  Birzele et al. 2000; Edwards et al. 2001 . Detailed protocols for mycotoxin analysis can be seen in several of the most recent reviews and books and the most recent edition of AOAC  Gilbert 1999; Trucksess and Pohland 2001; Van Dolah and Richard 1999 .  4.2.3 Dietary Modiﬁcations  Dietary modiﬁcation greatly affects the absorption, distri- bution, and metabolism of mycotoxin and subsequently affect its toxicity [reviewed in Bhatnagar et al.  2002 ]. For  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   example, the carcinogenic effect of AFB1 is affected by nutritional factors, dietary additives, and anticarcinogenic substances. Diet containing chemoprotective agents and antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, BHA, BHT, ethoxyquin, oltipraz, penta-acetyl geniposide, Kolaviron biﬂavonoids, and even green tea, have also been found to inhibit carcinogenesis caused by AFB1 in test animals. The toxic effect of OA and FmB to test animals was minimized when antioxidants such as vitamins C and E are added to the diet. Ascorbic acid also provided protective effect against AFs. Aspartame, which is partially effective in decreasing the nephrotoxic and genotoxic effects of OA, competes with OA for binding to serum albumin. L-phenylalanine was found to have some protective effect for the toxic effects of OA because it diminishing OA’s inhibitory effect to some of enzymes discussed earlier.  Most mycotoxins have a high afﬁnity for hydrated sodium calcium aluminasilicate  HSCAS or NovaSil  and other related products. Diets containing NovaSil and related absorbers have been found effective in preventing absorption of AFB1 and several other mycotoxins in test animals, thus decreasing their toxicity [ see Bhatnagar et al. 2002; Huwig et al. 2001; Philips et al. 2002 ]. Likewise, several other adsorbants such as zeolite, bentonite, and superactive charcoal have been found to be effective in decreasing the toxicity of other mycotoxins such as T-2 toxin.  5 CONCLUSIONS  insect, or other animal  Mycotoxins are low molecular weight secondary metabolites of fungi that are contaminants of agricultural commodities, foods, and feeds. Fungi that produce these toxins do so both prior to harvest and during storage. Although contamination of commodities by toxigenic fungi occurs frequently in areas with a hot and humid climate  i.e., conditions favorable for fungal growth , they can also be found in temperate conditions. Production of mycotoxins is dependent upon the type of producing fungus and environmental conditions such as the substrate, water activity  moisture and relative humidity , duration of exposure to stress conditions, and microbial, interactions. Although outbreaks of mycotoxicoses in humans have been documen- ted, several of these have not been well characterized, neither has a direct correlation between the mycotoxin and resulting toxic effect been well established in vivo. Even though the speciﬁc modes of action of most of the toxins are not well established, acute and chronic effects in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems, including humans have been reported. The toxicity of the mycotoxins varies considerably with the toxin, the animal species exposed to it, and the extent of exposure, age, and nutritional status. Most of the toxic effects of mycotoxins are limited to speciﬁc organs, but several mycotoxins affect many organs. Induction of cancer by some mycotoxins is a major concern as a chronic effect of these toxins. It is nearly impossible to eliminate mycotoxins from food and feed in spite of the regulatory efforts at the national  and international levels to remove the contaminated commodities. This is because mycotoxins are highly stable compounds, the producing fungi are ubiquitous, and food contamination can occur both before and after harvest. Nevertheless, good farm management practices and adequate storage facilities minimize the toxin contamination problems. A combination of natural biocontrol competition fungi and enhancement of host-resistance against fungal growth or toxin production could prevent toxin formation to a very signiﬁcant extent. Rigorous programs for reducing the risk of human and animal exposure to contaminated food and feed also include economically feasible and safe detoxiﬁcation processes and dietary modiﬁcations. Although risk assessment has been made for some mycotoxins  Coker 1998; DeVries et al. 2002 , additional, systematic epidemiological data for human exposure is needed for establishing toxicological parameters is for mycotoxins and the safe dose for humans. unreasonable to expect complete elimination of the mycotoxin problem. But multiple approaches will be needed to minimize the negative economic impact of the toxins on the entire agriculture industry as well as their harmful effects on human and animal health.

Mycotoxins are low-molecular weight, nonproteinaceous, organic secondary metabolites produced by fungi from amino acids, shikimic acid, or malyonyl CoA. These compounds are toxic, mutagenic, teratogenic, and carcinogenic to animals and humans  Bennett 1987; Bhatnagar et al. 2002; Eaton and Groopman 1994; Hall and Wild 1994; Squire 1989 . Over 300 mycotoxins have been identiﬁed, but only those implicated in mycotoxicoses involving humans have been studied in detail with respect to the biochemistry and genetics of their biosynthesis. Research on the natural occurrence, identiﬁ- cation and characterization, biosynthesis and genetic regulatory control of mycotoxins, as well as prevention and control of mycotoxin contamination of food and feed gained momentum after the incidence of “Turkey-X” disease in 1960 when 10,000 turkeys died due to aﬂatoxin contamination in the peanut-meal feed. Due to the risk of mycotoxin contamination of foods and feed on human health and livestock productivity  Brown et al. 1998; Eaton and Groopman 1994 , regulations have been established in over 50 countries for acceptable levels of mycotoxins in commodities for commerce or food and feed for human and animal consumption  Bhatnagar et al. 2002; Sharma and Salunkhe 1991 . Within the last decade, signiﬁcant progress toward the understanding of several mycotoxins in the world has been made. In this chapter, the genetics and biochemistry of only the most economically signiﬁcant mycotoxins, aﬂatoxins, sterigmatocystin  ST , trichothecenes, and fumo- nisins, are summarized and discussed. For other mycotoxins such as alternaria toxins AAL toxins, AK-toxin, ochratoxins, citrinin, cyclopiazonic acid  CPA , patulin, paxilline, zearalenone, ergot alkaloids and related toxins, and other neurotropic mycotoxins, kindly refer to the most recent  2 AFLATOXINS AND  STERIGMATOCYSTINS  2.1 Occurrence and Toxicology  Aﬂatoxins are toxic and carcinogenic secondary metabolites produced primarily by Aspergillus ﬂavus and A. parasiticus as well as A. nomius. One isolate of each of A. tamarii  Goto et al. 1996  and A. ochraceoroseus  Frisvad and Samson 1999  have been reported to produce aﬂatoxins  Klich et al. 2000 . The aﬂatoxins consist of a group of at least 16 structurally related toxins  Goldblatt 1969  characterized so far. Amongst these, aﬂatoxins, B1, B2, G1 and G2  AFB1, AFB2, AFG1 and AFG2  are the major toxins. Aﬂatoxins are polyketide- derived, bis-furan-containing dihydrofuranofuran and tetra- hydrofuran moieties  rings  fused with a substituted coumarin  Figure 1 . A. ﬂavus produces aﬂatoxins, B1 and B2; while A. parasiticus produces the four major aﬂatoxins, B1, B2, G1 and G2. The aﬂatoxins, M1 and M2, are modiﬁed forms of aﬂatoxin B1 found in bovine milk. Aﬂatoxin B1  AFB1  is the most potent naturally occurring toxin and carcinogen known  Squire 1989 . The toxicity of the major aﬂatoxins has been established in the following order: B1 . G1 . B2 . G2. Aﬂatoxin M1 is 10-fold less toxic than AFB1, but its presence in milk is of concern in human health  Cullen et al. 1987; Galvano et al. 1996; Van Egmond 1989b . Due to the toxic and carcinogenic properties of aﬂatoxins  Busby and Wogan 1981; Eaton and Groopman 1994 , these compounds are the most thoroughly studied of all the mycotoxins, and signiﬁcant research has been conducted on their biosynthetic pathway  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

Sterigmatocystin and dihydrosterigmatocystin  DHST  are produced by various Aspergilli including A. nidulans; several genera Bipolaris and Chaetomium, and Penicillium luteum are also reported to produce ST  Cole and Cox  1987  . Aspergillus nidulans is an industrial fungus and has been the model organism for the study of ST biosynthesis. ST and DHST are the penultimate precursors of AFB1, AFB2, AFG1 and AFG2, respectively  Figure 1; Betina 1989; CAST 1989; Chu 1991 . Like aﬂatoxins, ST and DHST are hepatotoxic and carcinogenic mycotoxins. However, their carcinogenicity is far less than that of aﬂatoxin B1 in animal test  Mori and Kawai 1989; Van der Watt 1977 . ST contaminates cereal grains  barley, rice and corn , coffee beans and cheese  Jelinek et al. 1989  and is considered a health hazard as well. Since ST and DHST are aﬂatoxin precursors, they share a common biochemical pathway, homologous genes and regulatory mechanism. For these reasons, aﬂatoxins and ST are discussed together.  2.2 The Clustering of Aﬂatoxin Biosynthetic  Pathway Genes  Signiﬁcant progress has been made in the last decade in deciphering aﬂatoxin biosynthetic pathway  Bennett 1981; 1987; 1986; 1994; Bhatnagar et al. 1988; 1991; 1992; 1993; 1998; Bhatnagar and Cleveland 1990; Cary et al. 2000a,b; Chang et al. 1992; 1993; 1995a,b; 2000b; Cleveland and Bhatnagar 1992; 2002; Dutton 1988; Minto and Townsend 1997; Papa 1982; 1984; Payne 1998; Payne and Brown 1998; Silva and Townsend 1996; Silva et al. 1996; Townsend 1997; Trail et al. 1995a; 1995b; Yu et al. 1993; 1995a; 1997; 1998; 2000a,b . As many as 15 structurally deﬁned aﬂatoxin intermediates have been identiﬁed in the aﬂatoxin ST biosynthetic pathway starting with the acetate, the polyketide precursors. At least 23 enzymatic steps involved in the aﬂatoxin biosynthesis have been characterized or proposed  Figure 1 .  It has been long proposed that the aﬂatoxin pathway genes may be clustered with a common regulator  Cleveland and Bhatnagar 1991 . The ﬁrst experimental evidence showing the potential clustering of aﬂatoxin pathway genes was, however, demonstrated by Trail et al.  1995b  when they found that the nor-1 and ver-1 genes were linked in a cosmid clone  NorA  with the regulatory gene aﬂR and a putative aﬂatoxin pathway gene, uvm8  now named fas-1  in between. This observation provided evidence that at least the early stages of the pathway may be linked. By mapping overlapping cosmid clones in A. parasiticus and A. ﬂavus  Yu et al. 1995a , a linkage of genes involved in aﬂatoxin formation, from early stage nor-1 gene to later stage omtA, was established indicating that the entire aﬂatoxin biosynthetic pathway genes may be clustered. This observation and subsequent discoveries of pathway genes led to a consensus cluster map consisting of at least nine aﬂatoxin pathway genes pksA, nor-1, uvm8  now named fas-1 , aﬂR, ver-1, omtA and three additional open reading frames  ORFs  with unknown function  ord-1, now named avnA; ord-2, now named ordA; and aad, now named norA   Yu et al. 1995a . The concept of aﬂatoxin pathway gene cluster greatly accelerated the rate of gene discovery  Cary et al. 1996; Chang et al. 1995a; 2000b; Chang and Yu 2002; Feng and Leonard 1995; Mahanti et al. 1996; Silva et al. 1996; Silva and Townsend 1996; Yu et al. 1997; 1998; 2000a,b,c . It was identiﬁed that at least 23 genes  Cary et al. 1996; Chang et al. 1992; 1993; 1995a; 2000b; Chang and Yu 2002; Cleveland et al. 1997; Meyers et al. 1998; Motomura et al. 1999; Prieto and Woloshuk 1997; Silva et al. 1996; Silva and Townsend 1996; Yu et al. 1993; 1995a; 1997; 1998; 2000a,b  or ORFs involved in aﬂatoxin biosynthesis including the regulatory genes, aﬂR and aﬂJ, were clustered together within approximately 80 kb DNA regions in the A. parasiticus and A. ﬂavus genomes respectively. Most of these genes on the aﬂatoxin pathway gene cluster have been cloned and characterized. The cloning of cypX and moxY genes  Yu et al. 2000a , the ordB gene  potentially for an oxidoreductase, Yu, unpublished , and the sugar utilization gene cluster  Yu et al. 2000c  deﬁned one end of the aﬂatoxin pathway gene cluster  Figure 1, panel A . The norB, cypA and aﬂT might possibly mark the other end of  Figure 1 Proposed and generally accepted pathway for aﬂatoxin B1, B2, G1 and G2 biosynthesis and the corresponding genes and their enzymes are presented. The aﬂatoxin biosynthetic pathway gene cluster in A. parasiticus and A. ﬂavus  panel A , sterigmatocystin biosynthetic pathway gene cluster in A. nidulans  panel B , and the non-functional, partially duplicated aﬂatoxin gene cluster in A. parasiticus  panel C  are shown. The gene names are labeled on the side of the cluster. Arrows indicate the direction of gene transcription. The homologous genes between the sterigmatocystin pathway gene cluster in A. nidulans and aﬂatoxin pathway gene cluster in A. parasiticus and A. ﬂavus is connected by line. The four sugar utilization genes linked to the aﬂatoxin pathway gene cluster are on the bottom of panel A. Abbreviations for the intermediates are: norsolorinic acid  NOR , averantin  AVN , 5 -hydroxyaverantin  HAVN , averufanin  AVNN , averuﬁn  AVF , versiconal hemiacetal acetate  VHA , versiconal  VAL , versicolorin B  VER B , versicolorin A  VER A , demethylsterigmatocystin  DMST , sterigmatocystin  ST , O-methylsterigmatocystin  OMST , aﬂatoxin B1  AFB1 , aﬂatoxin G1  AFG1 , DMDHST, dihydrosterigmatocystin  DHST , dihydro-O-methylsterigmatocystin  DHOMST , aﬂatoxin B2  AFB2 , and aﬂatoxin G2  AFG2 , Methyltransferase  M-transferase .  0  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   this cluster  Yu et al., unpublished; Chang et al., unpublished; Figure 1, panel A . Using a similar strategy, Brown et al.  1996b  deﬁned ST biosynthetic pathway gene cluster consisting of 25 coregulated transcripts in A. nidulans. The ST gene cluster contains probably a complete set of ST genes within approximately 60-kb DNA fragment  Brown et al. 1996b . The aﬂatoxin pathway gene clusters between A. ﬂavus and A. parasiticus are identical in term of the sequential order of the genes, the sizes of these genes and the direction of gene transcription. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the aﬂatoxin pathway genes are also highly conserved  . 95%  between A. parasiticus and A. ﬂavus  Yu et al. 1995a . Analyzing the corresponding genes and their enzymes for a speciﬁc pathway conversion step between A. ﬂavus  A. parasiticus for aﬂatoxin synthesis and A. nidulans for ST synthesis, it has been shown a high degree of similarity with respect to the genes, the enzyme encoded by these genes and their enzyme function. However, the order of these genes on the chromosome between the two clusters are totally scrambled  Figure 1, panel A & B .  In A. parasiticus, duplication of aﬂatoxin genes ver-1 and aﬂR was ﬁrst suggested  Mehigh et al., unpublished; Liang and Linz, unpublished  and reported by Liang et al.  1996 . This partial duplicated aﬂatoxin gene cluster consisting of seven duplicated genes, aﬂR2, aﬂJ2, adhA2, estA2, norA2, ver1B, omtB2, has been cloned and characterized by Chang and Yu  2002 . The genes within this partial duplicated cluster, due possibly to the chromosome location  Chiou et al. 2002; Yu et al., unpublished , were found to be unfunctional under normal conditions even though no apparent defects are identiﬁed in some of these genes  aﬂR2, aﬂJ2, adhA2, estA2 .  2.3 The Biosynthetic Pathways of Aﬂatoxins and  2.3.1 Acetate to Norsolorinic Acid  NOR  Trail et al.  Sterigmatocystin   1995b   Molecular evidence supports the plausible hypothesis that two fatty acid synthases  FAS  and a polyketide synthase  PKS  are involved in the synthesis of polyketide from acetate  Bhatnagar et al. 1992; Brown et al. 1996a; Townsend et al. 1984; Trail et al. 1995a . Complementation of an aﬂatoxin blocked UV mutant, UVM8, Mahanti et al.  1996  identiﬁed a gene named uvm8, which is required for NOR biosynthesis and aﬂatoxin production in A. parasiticus. The predicted amino acids of the gene uvm8 shares high degree of similarity  67%  and identity  48%  to the beta-subunit of FASs  FAS1  from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Yarrowia lipolytica  Trail et al. 1995a,b . Complementation, metabolite feeding and disruption experiments by Mahanti et al.  1996  conﬁrmed that the 7.5-kb large transcript of the gene uvm8 encodes one subunit of a novel FAS directly involved in the backbone formation prior to nor-1 of aﬂatoxin synthesis. For the proposed function, the gene uvm8 was renamed fas-1A. The fas-1A gene was renamed fas-1 encoding FAS-1 in the  aﬂatoxin biosynthetic pathway gene cluster  Figure 1, panel A . Sequence analyses have shown that there are two large genes, fas-1A and fas-2A, encoding for beta- and alpha- subunit of FAS, respectively  Mahanti et al. 1996, unpublished, personal communication . The gene fas-1A and fas-2A were renamed fas-1 and fas-2 in the aﬂatoxin pathway gene cluster encoding for FAS-1  FASa  and FAS-2  FASb , respectively  Payne and Brown 1998 . Brown et al.  1996a  proposed the involvement of FAS in ST biosynthesis in A. nidulans. They identiﬁed two genes, stcJ and stcK in the ST cluster, that are homologous to FASs, fas-2 and fas-1 of aﬂatoxin pathway genes, respectively. Disruption of stcJ and stcK encoding FASa and FASb subunits  FAS-2 and FAS-1 , respectively in A. nidulans, stopped ST synthesis. Watanabe et al.  1996  provided the biochemical evidence for the role of a FASs and PKSs in the biosynthesis of aﬂatoxin. The N-acetylcysteamine thioester of hexanoic acid could be incorporated into NOR in a disrupted fas-1 transformant. identiﬁed a gene wA Mayorga and Timberlake  1992  encoding the PKS in A. nidulans. Chang et al.  1995a  conﬁrmed that a PKS is required for aﬂatoxin biosynthesis by cloning the pksA gene encoding a PKS for the synthesis of polyketide from A. parasiticus. Feng and Leonard  1995  also isolated a pksL1 gene for PKS, the equivalent of pksA gene, by PCR from a pool of 19 A. parasiticus clones. Disruption of the pksL1 gene produced no aﬂatoxin or any aﬂatoxin intermediates. The pksL1 gene is 99% identical to pksA and they are believed to be the same gene. The 1% sequence discrepancy may possibly be due to strain variation and sequencing errors. Yu  1995  isolated a gene, pks ST that encodes a PKS from A. nidulans. The nucleotide sequence of pks ST from A. nidulans is identical to stcA  Brown et al. 1996b . However, no signiﬁcant sequence homology was found between wA and stcA   pks ST . The predicted amino acid sequences of these PKS contains a typical four conserved domains common to other known PKS proteins: b-ketoacyl synthase  KS , acyltransferase  AT , acyl carrier protein  ACP , and thioesterase  TE . The gene for PKS from A. parasiticus   pksA or pksL1  was designated as pksA  Yu et al. 1995a  in the aﬂatoxin pathway gene cluster and its homolog in A. nidulans was designated as stcA  Brown et al. 1996b . NOR is the ﬁrst stable intermediate in the pathway  Bennett 1981; Bennett et al. 1997; Papa 1979; 1982 . However, the predicted conversion product of PKS in the aﬂatoxin pathway is believed to be a noranthrone. The conversion for noranthrone to NOR is poorly deﬁned, but it has been proposed to occur by a noranthrone oxidase  Vederas and Nakashima 1980 , a monooxygenase  Bhatnagar et al. 1992 , or spontaneously  Dutton 1988 .  2.3.2 NOR to Averantin  AVN   Using NOR-accumulating mutants, it was demonstrated by Papa  1979 ; Papa  1982  in A. ﬂavus and by Bennett  1981 , Detroy et al.  1973  in A. parasiticus that NOR was an intermediate in aﬂatoxin biosynthetic pathway  Bennett et al. 1997 . It was found that the NOR-accumulating mutants were  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   always leaky without completely blocking aﬂatoxin bio- synthesis. Bhatnagar et al.  1992  proposed the involvement of dehydrogenase in the conversion of NOR to AVN and Chang et al.  1992  identiﬁed and cloned the gene, nor-1, that complemented a NOR-non-producing mutant in A. parasiticus. Trail et al.  1994  further characterized this gene to encode an enzyme that functions as a ketoreductase for the conversion of NOR to AVN. Cary et al.  1996  characterized a gene, norA encoding an aryl-alcohol dehydrogenase in the aﬂatoxin pathway gene cluster, which were involved in the conversion of NOR to AVN  Bennett et al. 1980; Bennett 1981; Bhatnagar et al. 1992 . An additional gene, norB, which was also found to be homologous to the nor-1 and norA genes in the aﬂatoxin pathway gene cluster in A. parasiticus  Yu et al. unpublished . The enzymatic function, and coordinated genetic regulation of the three NOR-converting genes are to be further investigated. The nor-1 homologous gene in A. nidulans is stcE  Brown et al. 1996b .  unclear. Woloshuk and Payne  1994  identiﬁed an alcohol dehydrogenase gene, adh1, in A. ﬂavus that is expressed concurrently with aﬂatoxin pathway genes. The adh1 gene in A. ﬂavus and adhA gene in A. parasiticus shares no signiﬁcant homology at both DNA and amino acid level. The involvement of the adh1 from A. ﬂavus in aﬂatoxin synthesis is to be investigated.  2.3.5 AVF to Versiconal Hemiacetal Acetate   VHA   The conversion from AVF to VHA is thought to involve an oxidase  Bhatnagar et al. 1992 . Yu et al.  2000b  cloned the avfA gene from both A. parasiticus and an AVF-accumulating A. ﬂavus strain as well as A. sojae strain that was shown by gene complementation experiment to encode for an enzyme  homologous to oxidase  responsible for the conversion from AVF to VHA. The avfA gene homolog in A. nidulans was identiﬁed to be stcO  Yu et al. 2000b .  2.3.3 AVN to 5  hydroxyaverantin  HAVN   2.3.6 VHA to Versiconal  VAL   0  Earliest evidence for the conversion of AVN to HAVN was elucidated via radiotracing by Bennett et al.  1980 , McCormick et al.  1987 . Subsequently, Yabe et al.  1991b , based on the enzymatic studies, proposed three enzymatic steps in two possible routes involved in the conversion of aﬂatoxin intermediates from NOR to AVF:  a  conversion from NOR to AVN catalyzed by a dehydrogenase;  b  conversion from NOR to HAVN by a monooxygenase;  c  HAVN then would be converted to AVF by a second dehydrogenase. Yabe et al.  1991b  also proposed that this reaction was reversible and that the NADPH was the preferred cofactor. Bhatnagar et al.  1992  proposed two alternate routes requiring 3 – 4 enzymes for the conversion of NOR to AVF. Yu et al.  1997  cloned and disrupted a gene that encodes a P-450 monooxygenase  previously named ord-1, Yu et al. 1995a . Using disruption and substrate feeding it was deﬁned that HAVN and averufanin  AVNN  are the conversion intermediate products from AVN to averuﬁn  AVF . This gene was designated avnA, which has high sequence similarity to the stcF gene in the A. nidulans ST cluster  Brown et al. 1996b .  2.3.4 HAVN to AVNN and AVF  In the proposed scheme by Yabe et al.  1991b; 1993 , AVNN was considered a shunt metabolite and not an aﬂatoxin intermediate. Bhatnagar et al.  1992  proposed both AVN and AVNN were the intermediates from NOR to AVF based on radiolabeling experiment. Chang et al.  2000b  cloned and characterized a gene, adhA, encoding an alcohol dehydro- genase in A. parasiticus. Gene disruption and feeding experiments demonstrated that AVN might be converted directly to AVF or indirectly to AVF through an intermediate substrate AVNN. The exact nature of the enzymatic function and the possible involvement of additional enzymes are still  The evidence for the involvement of an esterase in the conversion of VHA to VAL in aﬂatoxin biosynthesis was demonstrated by Bennett et al.  1976 , Fitzell et al.  1977 , Schroeder et al.  1974 , Yabe et al.  1991a,b , and Yao and Hsieh  1974 , when the A. parasiticus was treated with the organophosphorus pesticide dichlorvos. The esterase has been puriﬁed in A. parasiticus by Hsieh et al.  1989 ; Kusumoto and Hsieh  1996 . Yu et al.  2003  cloned a gene, estA, which could well be the gene for this esterase. The homologous gene in A. nidulans ST biosynthetic gene cluster is stcI. Attempts to disrupt the estA or stcI have not resulted in any conclusive evidence for these genes in toxin synthesis.  the involvement of  2.3.7 VAL to Versicolorin B  VER B   Yabe and Hamasaki  1993  provided enzymatic evidence for the conversion of VAL to VER B. Silva et al.  1996 , Silva and Townsend  1996 , and McGuire et al.  1996  cloned, characterized and expressed the vbs gene in the aﬂatoxin pathway gene cluster in A. parasiticus. It was demonstrated that the VER B synthase catalyzes the side chain cyclodehydration of racemic VHA to VER B. This is a key step in the aﬂatoxin formation since it closed the bisfuran ring of aﬂatoxin for binding to DNA. The homologous gene in A. nidulans ST biosynthetic gene cluster is stcN.  2.3.8 VER B to Versicolorin A  VER A   In the aﬂatoxin biosynthetic pathway, the VER B is a critical branch point  Bhatnagar et al. 1991  leading either to AFB1 and AFG1 or to AFB2 and AFG2. The conversion of VER B to VER A was proposed to require a desaturation of the bisfuran ring of VER B  Bhatnagar et al. 1993; Yabe and Hamasaki 1993 . Disruption of stcL in A. nidulans by Kelkar et al.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.    1997  stopped ST synthesis but resulted in the accumulation of VER B. The stcL gene, for a P-450 monooxygenase, was shown to be required for the conversion of VER B to VER A. A homologous gene to A. nidulans stcL in the aﬂatoxin pathway gene cluster, verB, encoding a P-450 mono- oxygenase desaturase, was cloned from A. parasiticus and A. ﬂavus strains  Bhatnagar et al., unpublished, GenBank accession numbers: AF106958, AF106959, and AF106960 respectively .  2.3.9 VER a to Demethylsterigmatocystin  DMST   and VER B to Demethyldihydrosterigmatocystin  DMDHST   Another cloned gene involved in a key step aﬂatoxin synthesis is the ver-1 gene  Skory et al. 1992  in A. parasiticus, this gene was shown by complementing the ver-1 mutant to be required for the conversion of VER A to DMST in A. parasiticus. Keller et al.  1994  identiﬁed a gene stcU  formerly named verA  in A. nidulans, which is a homolog of ver-1 in A. parasiticus for a ketoreductase, required for the conversion of VER A to DMST. Double mutation of stcU and stcL resulted accumulation of only VER B. Keller et al.  1995a  also identiﬁed stcS formerly named verB, Keller et al. 1995b , which is homologous to P-450 monooxygenases, to be involved in the conversion of VER A to DMST. Disruption of this gene resulted in the accumulation of VER A. Thus, both stcU and stcS are required for the conversion of VER B to DMST. The stcS homolog, named verA in A. parasiticus strain, was also identiﬁed  Yu, unpublished .  2.3.10 DMST to ST and DMDHST to DHST  Yabe et al.  1989  demonstrated a distinct methyltransferase activity in A. parasiticus for the conversion of DMST to ST. This enzyme may also be responsible for the conversion of DMDHST to DHST. The enzyme was puriﬁed and characterized  Yabe et al. 1998; Yabe et al. 1999 . Disruption of stcP in A. nidulans by Kelkar et al.  1996  showed the requirement of this gene for the conversion from DMST to ST. The gene responsible for the conversion of DMST to ST and DMDHST to DHST were cloned by Motomura et al.  1999 , named dmtA for O-methyltransferase in A. parasiticus and concurrently by Yu et al.  2000b , named omtB for O-methyltransferase B in A. parasiticus, A. ﬂavus and A. sojae.  I  2.3.11 ST To O-methylsterigmatocystin  OMST   and DMST to Dihydro-O- methylsterigmatocystin  DHOMST   Several researchers  Bhatnagar et al. 1988; Keller et al. 1993; Yabe et al. 1989  reported the presence of an O-methyltransferase for the conversion of ST to OMST and DHST to DHOMST. Yu et al.  1993  cloned the cDNA  sequence from A. parasiticus  initially named omt-1, later renamed as omtA  by reverse genetics. The enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli and its activity to convert ST to OMST was demonstrated by substrate feeding studies. The genomic DNA sequence of this gene  omtA  was cloned from A. parasiticus and A. ﬂavus  Yu et al. 1995b . This omtA gene homologue was also detected in other aﬂatoxigenic and nonaﬂatoxigenic Aspergillus species  Klich et al. 1995 .  2.3.12 OMST to Aﬂatoxin B1  AFB1  and Aﬂatoxin  G1  AFG1  and DMDHST to Aﬂatoxin B2  AFB2  and Aﬂatoxin G2  AFG2   By feeding experiments, Yabe et al.  1988a  proposed the relationship between B-Group  AFB1 and AFB2  and G-Group  AFG1 and AFG2  aﬂatoxin biosynthesis. It was also predicted by Bhatnagar et al.  1992  that in the late stages of aﬂatoxin biosynthesis, a NADPH-dependent mono- oxygenase is required for the conversion of OMST to AFB1. Prieto et al.  1996 , Prieto and Woloshuk  1997  reported in A. ﬂavus that a P-450 monooxygenase gene, ord-1, is required for this reaction. Yu et al.  1998  cloned the P-450 monooxygenase gene, ordA, from A. parasiticus and an A. ﬂavus mutant strain and demonstrated by expression and substrate feeding in yeast system that this gene is responsible for the conversion of OMST to AFB1 and AFG1, and DHOMST to AFB2 and AFG2. In this study, the critical amino acids for the enzymatic activity and heme-binding motif were identiﬁed by site-directed mutagenesis as well. Yu et al.  1998  also demonstrated that additional enzyme s  is the G-group  AFG1 and AFG2  aﬂatoxin required for synthesis. However, the enzyme s  and corresponding gene s  have not been isolated as yet. It should be noted that the functions of three additional genes in the aﬂatoxin pathway gene cluster, cypA Yu, unpublished , cypX   cypX ¼ stcB  and moxY  moxY ¼ stcW  encoding cyto-  chrome P-450 monooxygenases and monooxygenase  Yu et al. 2000a , have not yet been assigned. Keller et al.  2000  examined several characterized cytochrome P-450 mono- oxygenases and proposed the functions for some of the identiﬁed genes or ORFs encoding monooxygenases in aﬂatoxin ST synthesis. However, there is a possibility that these genes might be involved in the G-group toxin formation.  2.4 Factors Affecting Aﬂatoxin ST Biosynthesis  2.4.1 Genetic Regulation  Since the aﬂatoxin and ST biosynthetic pathway genes are found to be clustered on a single chromosome in both A. parasiticus and A. ﬂavus and in A. nidulans, respectively,  Brown et al. 1996b; Woloshuk and Prieto 1998; Yu et al. 1995a , these genes are presumably expressed concurrently in the genome. In both the aﬂatoxin and ST gene clusters, there is a positive regulatory gene, aﬂR, for activating pathway gene transcription located in the middle of the gene clusters.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   0  0  -TCGN5CGA-3  The aﬂR gene, coding for a sequence speciﬁc zinc binuclear DNA-binding protein, a Gal 4-type 47 kDa polypeptide, has been shown to be required for transcriptional activation of most, if not all, the structural genes  Chang et al. 1993; 1995b; 1999a,b; Ehrlich et al. 1998; Flaherty and Payne 1997; Payne et al. 1993; Yu et al. 1997; Woloshuk et al. 1994  by binding in the to the palindromic sequence 5 promoter region of the structural genes  Ehrlich et al. 1999a,b; Fernandes et al. 1998  in A parasiticus, A. ﬂavus, and A. nidulans  Yu et al. 1996 . In A. sojae, a nontoxigenic strain used in industrial fermentations, was found to contain a defective aﬂR gene in addition to potential other defects  Matsushima et al. 2001a,b; Takahashi et al. 2002 . Thus, with the absence of the functional regulatory protein, no induction of aﬂatoxin can occur in this food grade Aspergillus. Additional factors involved in regulation of aﬂatoxin synthesis were evidenced by Flaherty and Payne  1997 . Adjacent to the aﬂR gene in the aﬂatoxin gene cluster, a divergently transcribed gene, aﬂJ, was also found to be involved in the regulation of transcription  Meyers et al. 1998; Chang, personal communication . The exact mechanism by which aﬂJ modulates transcription of these pathway genes in concert with aﬂR is to be studied. A gene, aﬂT, encoding a membrane bound protein with homology to antibiotic efﬂux genes presumed to be for transporting aﬂatoxin out of the fungal cell, was discovered in A. parasiticus  Chang and Yu, unpublished, GenBank accession number: AF268071 . The aﬂT gene might be involved in someway in aﬂatoxin secretion.  2.4.2 Nutritional Control  Carbon and Nitrogen  Sources   The best-known nutritional factors affecting aﬂatoxin biosyn- thesis are carbon and nitrogen sources  Adye and Mateles 1964; Bennett et al. 1979; Luchese and Harrigan 1993 . It is clear that simple sugars such as glucose, sucrose, fructose, and maltose support aﬂatoxin formation, while peptone and lactose are not  Buchanan and Stahl 1984; Payne and Brown 1998 . Woloshuk et al.  1997  reported the connection between alpha amylase activity and aﬂatoxin production in A. ﬂavus. Yu et al.  2000c  identiﬁed a group of four genes that constitute a well-deﬁned gene cluster related to sugar utilization in A. parasiticus next to the aﬂatoxin pathway gene cluster. The expression of the hxtA gene, encoding a hexose transporter protein, was found to be concurrent with the aﬂatoxin pathway cluster genes in aﬂatoxin- conducive medium. This is the ﬁrst evidence that primary metabolism  sugar metabolism  and secondary metabolism  aﬂatoxin biosynthesis  are genetically linked on the chromo- some. A close physical linkage between the two gene clusters could point to a relationship between the two clusters in reference to the processing of carbohydrates leading to the induction of aﬂatoxin biosynthesis. Lipid substrate was shown to be a good carbon source to support aﬂatoxin production  Fanelli and Fabbri 1989; Fanelli et al. 1983; 1995 . A lipase lipA, was cloned by Yu et al.  unpublished  in gene, A. parasiticus and A. ﬂavus. It was demonstrated that this  lipase gene expression and subsequent aﬂatoxin production are induced by lipid substrate. Nonaﬂatoxin-conducive peptone medium supplemented with 0.5% soybean oil induces lipase gene expression and leads to aﬂatoxin formation  Yu et al. unpublished .  Nitrogen source plays an important role in aﬂatoxin production. Asparagine, aspartate, alanine, ammonium nitrate, ammonium nitrite, ammonium sulfate, glutamate, glutamine, and proline containing media support aﬂatoxin production; while sodium nitrate and sodium nitrite containing media do not  Davis et al. 1967; Eldridge 1964; Payne et al. 1983; Reddy et al. 1971; 1979 . Studies by Kachholz and Demain  1983 , Niehaus and Jiang  1989  suggested that nitrate represses AVF and aﬂatoxin formation. It was shown that while high temperature and nitrate support ST production in A. nidulans, the opposite was seen with A. parasiticus where these culture conditions repress synthesis of aﬂatoxin  Feng and Leonard 1998 . Studies by Chang et al.  1995b  demonstrated that nitrate has suppressive effect on aﬂatoxin production and overexpres- sion of aﬂR gene by additional copies of aﬂR could be required to overcome the negative regulatory effect on aﬂatoxin pathway gene transcription in the nitrogen control circuit. Chang et al.  1996  cloned a nitrogen utilization gene two genes, niaD and niiA from cluster consisting of A. parasiticus, A. oryzae, A. niger and A. nidulans and a nitrogen regulator, areA  Chang et al. 2000a  from A. parasiticus. In the intergenic region between aﬂR and aﬂJ several AreA binding motifs have been identiﬁed  Chang et al. 2000a . The AreA binding could prevent AﬂR binding. It seems that the aﬂatoxin formation and nitrogen metabolism are closely linked.  2.4.3 Environmental Inﬂuences  Aﬂatoxin production are also affected by many environmental factors  Bennett and Papa 1988; Demain 1972; Kale et al. 1994; Kale et al. 1996; Yabe et al. 1988b  such as physiological pH, temperature and water activity in the environment, volatile metabolites produced in host plant in response to fungal invasion, and developmental stages of the fungi.  Fungi have the ability to maintain internal pH and respond to the environmental changes. Studies by Cotty  1988  demonstrated the pH effect on aﬂatoxin formation and sclerotia development. Acidic pH condition favors aﬂatoxin biosynthesis in response to pH  Espeso et al. 1993; Keller et al. 1997 . It is believed that pacC is a major transcriptional regulatory factor  Keller et al. 1997 . In the promotor region of the regulatory gene, aﬂR, at least one pacC binding site has been identiﬁed  Ehrlich et al. 1999a . In the nonaﬂatoxin- inducing peptone medium, it was shown to be inhibitory to aﬂatoxin formation  Cotty 1988 . The regulatory mechanism might be due to the binding of pacC to the PACC site in the aﬂR promoter region to repress the transcription of acid- expressed gene aﬂR and the aﬂatoxin formation  Espeso et al. 1993  since such medium keeps the medium  pH 7.4  at alkaline condition  Cotty 1988 .

However, severe aﬂatoxin outbreak in corn was documented under hot weather and drought conditions  Brown et al. 1998 . The mechanism of A. ﬂavus infestation in corn under these conditions is not well understood. The possible scenarios may include a combination of these factors:  a  the plant defense mechanism is weakened under feeding and water stress conditions; associated injuries to plant thus providing entry opportunities for fungal invasion; and  c  more fungal spores dispersed in the air under drier climate conditions.   b  higher tissues,  insect  Plant metabolites also play some role on aﬂatoxin formation. Zeringue  1991; 1996; 1993  reported plant metabolism and aﬂatoxin production. Wright et al.  2000  reported that at certain conditions, n-Decyl aldehyde reduces not only fungal growth of A. parasiticus but also aﬂatoxin production by over 95% compared with control. Octanal reduces fungal growth by 60%, however, increases aﬂatoxin production by 500%, while hexanal reduces fungal growth by 50%, but shows no effect on aﬂatoxin production. A relationship between fungal development  production of reproductive spore and survival structure sclerotia  and aﬂatoxin synthesis was studied  Garber and Cotty 1997 . Wilson et al.  2001  reported that the 13 S -hydroperoxide derivative of the reaction product of lipoxygenase  encoded by L2 LOX gene from maize , involved in reducing aﬂatoxin production. The fungal morphology was signiﬁcantly altered and toxin synthesis was inhibited during strain degeneration studies. The effect included the inhibition of expression of the toxin pathway genes, including aﬂR.  linoleic acid,  3 TRICHOTHECENES  3.1 Occurrence and Toxicology  The trichothecenes constitute a class of over 80 different members of sesquiterpenoid compounds produced by a number of genera of ﬁlamentous fungi. Based on the presence of a macrocyclic ester or ester-ether bridge between C-4 and C-15, trichothecenes are generally classiﬁed as macrocyclic  Type C  or non-macrocyclic  Types A and B . The trichothecenes, including diacetoxyscirpenol  DAS , deoxy- nivalenol  DON , and T-2 toxin, are mainly produced by Fusarium species  Bhatnagar et al. 2002; Brown et al. 2001; Chu 1997; Proctor 2000; Sharma and Kim 1991 . The more structurally complex macrocyclic trichothecenes are pro- duced by the fungal genera Myrothecium, Stachybotrys, and Trichothecium. Trichoderma, Cephalosporium, and  Verticimonosporium are also found to produce the trichothe- cenes. The most potent trichothecenes are contact toxins and cause severe blistering and necrosis of the target tissue. Their cytotoxicity parallels their acute toxicity in animals with T-2 toxin being more potent than nivalenol. Nivalenol is much more potent as an acute toxin than is DON. These trichothecenes are of great concern for food and feed contamination. DON is of considerable importance to agricultural economies because animals refuse to eat contaminated grain. F. sporotrichioides and F. graminearum are the best studied among the trichothecene producing fungi which are responsible for trichothecene contamination of grains such as maize, wheat, barley, and rye  Brown et al. 2001; Chu 1997; Proctor 2000 .  3.2 Clustering of Trichothecene Biosynthetic  Pathway Genes  trichothecene pathway,  ten genes with the designation,  The trichothecene biosynthesis involves multiple enzymatic reactions controlled by multiple genes. Biochemical and genetic studies of initially in F. sporotrichioides using overlapping cosmid clones has resulted in establishing the consensus map of the trichothe- cene pathway gene cluster on a 25 kb region of the F. sporotrichioides chromosome  Brown et al. 2001; Hohn et al. 1993a; Proctor 2000; Trapp et al. 1998 . This gene cluster consists of in sequential order, TRI8, TRI7, TRI3, TRI4, TRI6, TRI5, TRI10, TRI9, TRI11, and TRI12, respectively  Figure 2, Brown et al. 2001 . In F. graminearum, a similar gene cluster has been identiﬁed except that TRI7 in F. graminearum is nonfunctional  Brown et al. 2001; Matsumoto et al. 1999; Proctor et al. 1995a; 1997. The gene organization and direction both in F. In both F. sporotrichioides and F. graminearum, the eleventh gene involved in trichothecene biosynthesis, TRI101, was isolated outside the established trichothecene pathway gene cluster by Kimura et al.  1998a , McCormick et al.  1999 . Wuchiyama identiﬁed the TRI12 counterpart gene in et al. F. graminearum designated, TRI102, which encodes a trichothecene efﬂux pump. Lee et al.  2001  identiﬁed a similar trichothecene gene cluster in Gibberella zeae in the order of, TRI8, TRI7, TRI3, TRI4, TRI6, TRI5, TRI10, TRI9, TRI11, and TRI102, respectively. The TRI102 in Gibberella zeae shares signiﬁcant homology with the TRI12 and TRI102 in F. sporotrichioides and F. graminearum. However, the TRI102 in Gibberella zeae was found to be nonfunctional  identical and F. graminearum.  sporotrichioides  transcription   2000   are  of  Figure 2 Biochemical pathway and the speciﬁc genes and their enzymes involved in trichothecene biosynthesis in Fusarium species.

All Rights Reserved.    Lee et al. 2001 . Note that TRI1 and TRI2 were named based on UV-generated nontrichothecene-producing mutants. So far no corresponding gene or DNA sequences on molecular level have been identiﬁed yet and the location of these mutated loci are still unclear  Robert H. Proctor, personal communication . The functions of most of the identiﬁed genes have been proposed or characterized except TRI9 which encodes the smallest peptide consisting of only 43 amino acids with its function unknown  Figure 2, Brown et al. 2001 .  3.3 Biosynthetic Pathways of Trichothecenes  From the ﬁrst trichothecene skeleton, trichodiene, to the ﬁnal product, T-2 toxin, through a series chemical modiﬁcations of isomerization, cyclization, and esteriﬁcation oxidation, least 16 know stable intermediates, which reactions, at constitute the various members of the trichothecenes including the branch products DON and nivalenol, have been identiﬁed. The biochemical conversion scheme of these compounds are trichodiene, 2-hydroxytrichodiene, 12,13 epoxy-9,10-trichoene-2-ol, isotri- chodermol, isotrichodermin, 15-decalonectrin, calonectrin, 3,15-DAS, 3,4,15-triacetoxyscirpenol, 3-acetoxyscirpenol, 3-acetyl T-2 toxin, T-2 toxin. The DON is thought to have branched from 15-decalonectrin and the nivalenol is thought to have branched from 3,15-DAS  Brown et al. 2001; Proctor 2000 . DON could be converted directly to nivalenol  Figure 2 .  isotrichodiol,  trichotriol,  The initial step of the trichothecene biosynthesis involves the incorporation of three molecules of mevalonate into the trichothecene nucleus of trichothecin with the cyclization of farnesyl pyrophosphate to produce trichodiene. TRI5 is the ﬁrst characterized pathway gene that encodes a trichodiene synthase involved in this initial step of trichothecene biosynthesis  Hohn and Beremand 1989 . Hohn and Desjardins  1992  isolated a gene, named Tox5, encoding a trichodiene synthases for the synthesis of trichodiene from farnesyl pyrophosphate. The Tox5 gene  renamed TRI5  was characterized in great detail by Desjardins et al.  1987 , Desjardins et al.  1993 , Cane et al.  1995 , and Hohn et al.  1993b . The predicted amino acid sequences of the TRI4 and TRI11 gene products were similar to those of cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases  Alexander et al. 1998; Hohn et al. 1995 . TRI4 was found to catalyze the oxygenation of trichodiene at the C-2 position to yield 2-hydroxytrichocdiene  Hohn et al. 1995 . The most signiﬁcant oxidation step in trichothecene biosynthesis is provided by this cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase encoded by TRI4 to introduce the C-12, 13 epoxide. Alexander et al.  1998  demonstrated that the TRI11 is involved in the conversion of isotrichodermin to 15-decalonectrin by oxygenating the C-15 position of isotrichodermin. Studies by McCormick et al.  1999  indicated that the acetylation of isotrichodermin is catalyzed by TRI101. This gene may also play a role in self-protection against the toxic effect of trichothecene to the fungus by modulating trichothecene production  Muhitch et al. 2000 .  By gene disruption experiment, the TRI3 gene was found to encode an acetyltransferase catalyzing the conversion of 15-decalonectrin to calonectrin via acetylation at the C-15 position  McCormick et al. 1996 . Gene disruption and precursor feeding studies in F. sporotrichioides by Brown et al.  2001  demonstrated that TRI7 might function as C-4 acetylase or acetylesterase involved in the conversion from 3,15-DAS to 3,4,15-triacetoxyscirpenol. However, no func- tional enzyme encoded by TRI7 was predicted in F. graminearum due to the lack of initiation codon, six possible frameshifts, and early stop codon  Brown et al. 2001 . Brown et al.  2001  demonstrated that disruption of the TRI8 gene failed to produce T-2 toxin instead accumulated 4,15-DAS. The chemical reaction was presumably involved in the 3-deacetylation of 3,4,15-DAS. Since the predicted amino acid sequence is homologous to lipase, the TRI8 might encode an esterase oxygenase and be responsible for esteriﬁcation of the C-8 oxygen for the conversion some- where between 3,4,15-triacetoxyscirpenol and 3-acetyl T-2 toxin. TRI12 encode a toxin efﬂux pump  Alexander et al. 1999 . TRI6 is a regulatory gene  Desjardins et al. 1993; Hohn et al. 1999; Keller and Hohn 1997; Matsumoto et al. 1999; Proctor et al. 1995b; Proctor 2000; Trapp et al. 1998 . TRI10 encodes a polypeptide of 420 amino acids for another regulatory protein  Tag et al. 2001 . The regulatory function of the TRI6 and TRI10 genes will be discussed in more detail in the next section. The enzymes responsible for some of the biosynthetic steps, such as the last step for the synthesis of T-2 toxin from 3-acetyl T-2 toxin by a deacetylase, have been proposed. However, the genes for those enzymes have not yet been identiﬁed  Brown et al. 2001 . Most recently, two additional new genes, TRI13  from Gibberrella zeae  and TRI14  from F. sporotrichioides , involved in trichothecene biosynthesis, have been isolated and deposited in the GenBank database  Daren W. Brown et al., personal communication .  Synthesis of the structurally more complex macrocyclic trichothecenes such as roridin E, verrucrin, and baccharinoid B7 is most commonly by the genus Myrothecium. The macrocyclic trichothecenes exhibit about 10-fold more toxic than the Fusarium trichothecenes. Trapp et al.  1998  identiﬁed, in M. roridum, the homologues of the F. sporotrichioides TRI5  MrTRI5 , TRI4  MrTRI4 , and TRI6  MrTRI6  genes which were located within a region of about 40 kb in M. roridum compared to only 8-kb in the F. sporotrichioides. The deduced amino acid sequence of the MrTRI5 product demonstrated a homology of 72% to 75% to trichodiene synthases from four Fusarium species. The predicted MrTRI6 gene product was twice as large as that of the FsTRI6 with low amino acid homologies except in the C-terminal region of MrTRI6  78%  where the zinc-ﬁnger motifs reside.  3.4 Regulation of Trichothecene Biosynthesis  The TRI6 gene is located in the middle of the trichothecene gene cluster in both F. sporotrichioides and F. graminearum  Proctor et al. 1995b . The TRI6 gene encodes a pathway-  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   0  YNAGGCC-3  regulatory gene that  speciﬁc regulatory protein required for the expression of trichothecene biosynthetic pathway genes  Desjardins et al. 1993; Hohn et al. 1999; Keller and Hohn 1997; Matsumoto et al. 1999; Proctor et al. 1995b; 2000; Trapp et al. 1998 . The predicted polypeptides encoded by TRI6 in both F. sporotrichioides and F. graminearum consist of 217 and 218 amino acids, respectively. In the C-terminus of this protein, the Cys2His2 type zinc-ﬁnger motifs, which deﬁne the function of this particular enzyme as a gene expression regulator, were identiﬁed. TRI6 was shown to bind to the promoter regions of nine pathway genes at the minimum 0  Hohn et al. 1999 . TRI6 as consensus site 5 a regulatory gene for binding of the protein to promoter region was supported by the study using site-directed mutagenesis in the predicted zinc-ﬁnger motif of the C- terminus of TRI6. Studies by Tag et al.  2001  showed that TRI10 is another novel regulates trichothecene gene expression and trichothecene synthesis. TRI10 gene encodes a protein consisting of 420 amino acids, which does not match signiﬁcantly to any proteins of known or predicted function or to motifs except a single transmembrane domain  Tag et al. 2001 . Disruption of TRI10 in F. sporotrichioides signiﬁcantly decreased the transcript accumulation of the ﬁve tested genes, TRI4, TRI5, TRI6, TRI101, and the farnesyl pyrophosphate synthethase  Fpps  gene, and abolished T-2 toxin production. Com- plementation of TRI10 into the disrupted mutant elevated the transcript accumulation of the above ﬁve genes and signiﬁcantly increased T-2 toxin production  Tag et al. 2001 . Interestingly, disruption of TRI6 decreased transcrip- increased tion of other trichothecene pathway genes but TRI10 transcription. TRI10 is required for the full expression of trichothecene pathway genes including the regulatory gene TRI6 and the expression of primary metabolic pathway genes the trichothecene biosynthetic pathway. TRI6 is not required for TRI10 expression but inhibits TRI10 expression. TRI10 may also be involved in self protection of trichothecene toxin  Tag et al. 2001 . TRI12 encodes a trichothecene efﬂux pump with sequence similarities to known members of the major toxin transporters. Characterization of the TRI12 gene by Alexander et al.  1999  showed that disruption of TRI12 resulted in reduced growth on complex media and reduced levels of trichothecene biosynthesis. Expression of TRI12 and TRI3 in yeast mutant  defective in the PDR5 transporter which is believed to be for toxin the role of TRI12 in resistance in yeast  indicated that F. functions as self-protection against trichothecenes compared with the expression of TRI3 alone in this yeast mutant. An additional gene, TRI101 from F. graminearum, which is located outside the established trichothecene gene cluster, appears to play a role in self- protection against trichothecenes  Kimura et al. 1998b; McCormick et al. 1999 . Disruption of TRI101 in F. sporotrichioides  FsTRI101  leads to reduced-growth on trichothecene-containing media compared to the wild- role for FsTRI101 in type strain suggesting a similar  sporotrichioides  that precedes   Fpps   self-protection against trichothecenes  Kimura et al. 1998b; McCormick et al. 1999 .  4 FUMONISINS  4.1 Occurrence and Toxicology  Investigation of the association of human esophageal cancer and the consumption of Fusarium verticillioides  formerly called F. moniliforme  infested maize by South African Researchers suggested that fumonisins were a new group of mycotoxins  Bezuidenhout et al. 1988; Gelderblom et al. 1988 . Even though the fumonisins were originally identiﬁed from F. verticillioides, these toxins have been reported in cultures of F. anthophilum, F. dlamini, F. napiforme, F. oxysporum, and F. proliferatum  Desjardins et al. 2000; Munkvold and Desjardins 1997; Musser and Plattner 1997; Seo et al. 1996 . No other genera have been reported to produce fumonisins other than fungi. Production of fumonisins by Alternaria has also been reported  Mirocha et al. 1992; Mirocha et al. 1996. Some fumonisin-producing Fusaria have been known to produce AAL toxins, a compound with its structure closely related to fumonisins  Mirocha et al. 1992 . The Alternaria alternata, a tomato pathogen, was found to produce AAL toxin  Wang et al. 1996 . The fumonisins produced by F. verticillioides and F. proliferatum pose the greatest health hazard to human and animals since these species readily colonize corn all over the world  Bhatnagar et al. 2002; Dutton 1996; Proctor 2000; Riley et al. 1996; Scott 1993 .  Nine structurally related fumonisins, including FB1, FB2, FB3, FB4, FA1, and FA2, have been identiﬁed. Fumonisin B1  FB1  is the most abundant in maize. Chemically, FB1 is a derivative  diester  of propane-1,2,3-tricarboxylic acid of 2-amino-12,16-dimethyl-3,5,10,14,15-pentahydroxyicosane  Gelderblom et al. 1988; 1992a,b; Marasas 1995; Nelson et al. 1993; Riley et al. 1996; Scott 1993; Shier 1992 . Other B series fumonisins such as fumonisin B2  FB2 , B3  FB3 , and  FB4 , occur at low levels. Related structurally to B series fumonisins, the four other series of fumonisins  A, AK, C, and P  also occur at low levels  Proctor 2000 . The other fumonisins are resulted from removal of tricarballylic acid and other ester groups  Musser et al. 1996; Seo et al. 1996 .  Fumonisins have been shown to have diverse biological and toxicological effects. The mechanism of fumonisin toxicity is not well understood. Studies have shown that fumonisins inhibit ceramide synthase. Fumonisins have been shown to be hepatotoxic and carcinogenic in rats resulting in liver cirrhosis and hepatic nodules, adenoﬁbrosis, hepato- cellular carcinoma, ductular carcinoma, and cholangio- carcinoma  Gelderblom et al. 1988; 1991; 1992b; 1993; 1994; Marasas 1996 . Studies on rats by Riley et al.  1996  suggested that fumonisin B1  FB1  might act primarily as a tumor promoter. The tumor promoting activity of fumonisins has also been proposed by Huang et al.  1995 , Wattenberg et al.  1996  to have been resulted from the stimulation or  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   suppression of signal transduction enzymes, the mitogen- activated protein kinase and protein kinase C. The mechanism of toxicological effect is a subject of intense study.  4.2 Genetics and Biosynthesis of Fumonisins   1996b  established that  Genetic and biochemical studies on fumonisin biosynthesis are fairly recent. No comprehensive biosynthetic pathway and genetic and enzymatic establishments like aﬂatoxins or trichothecenes are available currently. Fumonisin biosyn- thesis has been of signiﬁcant research interest in the last few years  Desjardins and Proctor 1999; Proctor et al. 1999a; Proctor 2000 . A linear 19- or 20-carbon chain is the fumonisin backbone that is substituted at various positions with hydroxyl, methyl, and tricarballylic acid moieties and an amino group at C-2  Proctor 2000 . Carbon labeling studies suggested that a PKS, alanine, methionine and other amino acids are involved in fumonisin synthesis  Desjardins et al. 1996a . Classical genetic analyses do provide some insight into the fumonisin biosynthesis and genetic control. Desjardins et al. the genes responsible for fumonisin biosynthesis are closely linked on chromosome 1 when they studied on the FB1-non-producing mutant of G. fujikuroi MP-A. By complementation analysis in FB1-non-producing mutant of G. fujikuroi MP-A using fum5-containing cosmid clone, Proctor et al.  1999b  the fum5 is involved in fumonisin demonstrated that biosynthesis. The predicted amino acid sequence of fum5 showed high degree of similarity to fungal type I PKSs. Disruption and complementation analysis of the cloned G. fujikuroi gene, fum5, encoding a PKS, Proctor et al.  1999b  concluded that fumonisins are synthesized from polyketide rather than fatty acids. In order to identify additional genes that are potentially involved in fumonisin production near fum5, the DNA regions approximately 7-kb downstream and 15-kb upstream of this fum5 gene have been sequenced  Proctor 2000 . A total of 8 ORFs, 5 ORFs in the upstream and 3 ORFs in the downstream have been identiﬁed. Based on sequence homologies to known genes and proteins, four of the ORFs appear to encode proteins that would be expected to be involved in fumonisin production. One of these ORFs encodes a putative cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase. Even though none of the fumonisin biosynthetic genes was isolated except fum5 for the PKS, classic genetic analysis using Gibberella fujikuroi  sexual stage of F. moniliforme  have identiﬁed four loci involved in fumonisin biosynthesis designated fum1, fum2, fum3, and fum4  Desjardins et al. 1995; Desjardins et al. 1996a,b; Plattner et al. 1996; Seo et al. fum1, might be 2001 . Studies indicated that involved in regulation of fumonisin production  Plattner et al. 1996 ; the allele, fum2, might be involved in hydroxylation of fumonisin at C-10 position  Desjardins et al. 1996b ; the allele, fum3, might be involved in hydroxylation of fumonisin at C-5 position  Desjardins et al. 1996b ; an additional UV generated mutant  uv26  has similar phenotype like fum3  the allele,   Proctor et al. 1997 . Xu and Leslie  1996  mapped fum1 onto the chromosome 1 in F. moniliforme and the other fum loci were also mapped onto chromosome 1. Based on the recombination frequencies, a relative distance and linear relationship of the fum loci and some other gene loci have been established  Proctor 2000  to be in sequential order, ald1, fum1, fum3  uv26 , fum2, and OPA16.  5 CONCLUSION  Within the last decade, signiﬁcant advances have been made in mycotoxin research with respect to their identiﬁcation, biochemistry, and genetics of their biosynthesis and regulation of toxin formation as well as mycotoxicosis and prevention and control. This is especially true for those mycotoxins such as aﬂatoxins, ST, fumonisins, and trichothecenes that are economically important in agriculture and pose greatest health hazard for human beings and livestock. The biosynthetic pathways, the clustering of these genes on the chromosome, the function of these genes and enzymes involved in the formation of these toxins have been elucidated in great details. Scientists have also acquired signiﬁcant knowledge on the gene expression and regulation of toxin synthesis within the corresponding gene cluster. A better understanding of the nutritional and environmental factors that affect the production of these mycotoxins has been examined in greater details.  There remains, however, a vast gap in our understanding of the coordinated global regulation on toxin formation, the potential existence of signal transduction pathways under- lying primary and secondary metabolisms, the effects of environmental factors, biotic and abiotic, on the toxin formation, the mode and regulation of plant-microbe  crop and fungi  interaction during infection. With the development and application of Expressed Sequence-Tag  EST  and microarray technologies, we will be able to study the whole organism on the molecular genetic level to address those unanswered questions. Only when we have a thorough and comprehensive understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of mycotoxin formation, will we be able to develop effective strategies to control mycotoxin contamination of food and feed on a consistent basis, resulting in a sustainable, nutritious, and healthy food supply for the entire increasing world population.

Niamke   Nam Sun Wang University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland, USA  1  INTRODUCTION  2 BIOMASS AS A SUGAR SOURCE  Cellulose and hemicellulose comprise about 50 and 30%, respectively, of the biomass the nature produces through photosynthesis and are by far the most abundant carbon polymers on earth. Lignin and minor amount of ash make up the remainder of the biomass. In addition to that which already exists in natural settings  especially in trees , cellulose hemicellulose is a large component of wastes originating from municipal, agricultural, forestry, and certain industrial sources. Its abundance alone supports the conten- tion that it is a valuable raw material for food production, energy generation, and chemical feedstock. Although only a small portion of what the nature produces is presently converted into useful products, this picture will likely change in the future, as the world population must ultimately depend on limited renewal resources for food, energy, and material goods  Millet et al. 1976 . Except for directly burning wood and wastes for energy generation, most cellulose-derived products ﬁrst require degrading of cellulose to constituent sugars before subsequent conversion, usually through microbial fermentation, of the sugars into a wide range of useful products, including ethanol, acetic acid, lactic acid, and antibiotics. Besides generating valuable chemical products, degradation of cellulose also reduces the waste disposal problems associated with landﬁlls and burning forests  Katzen and Monceaux 1995 . After several decades there are two main routes to of cellulose degradation: chemical  alkaline or acid  and biological  enzymatic or microbial . Of the latter route, fungi and anaerobic rumen bacteria are excellent candi- dates. In this chapter, we speciﬁcally focus on cellulose degradation by fungi and compare the economics of alternative processes.  research worldwide,  Cellulose is a long linear polymer ranging from 1000 to 1000 000 D-glucose units. Glucose monomers are linked together with b-1,4-glycosidic bonds to form highly stable chains, and these chains further aggregates together via hydrogen bonds to form a rigid crystalline structure that is water-impermeable, water-insoluble, and resistant to enzy- matic hydrolysis  Linko 1987 . The boundary and sequence structure of the molecules determine the chemical properties of cellulose  Alen and Sjostrom 1985 . On the other hand, hemicellulose, which is alkali-soluble, is composed of short, highly branched copolymer of both six-carbon and ﬁve- carbon sugars. The branched structure allows hemicellulose to exist in an amorphous form that is more susceptible to hydrolysis. Compared to cellulose, which is similar across all biomass sources, hemicellulose is quite diverse in structure and composition, depending on the source. The hydrolysis product of hemicellulose is typically a mixture of xylose, arabinose, galactose, mannose, glucuronic acid, and other sugars. The ratios of ﬁve-carbon and six-carbon sugars depend on the source species of the biomass. Compared to hardwoods and agricultural residues, softwoods generally contain more six-carbon sugars  D-glucose, D-galactose, and D-mannose  but less ﬁve-carbon sugars  D-xylose and L-arabinose   Alen and Sjostrom 1985 . With cellulose, a chief engineering challenge is degradation; whereas, with hemicellulose, a major limitation lies in microbial fermenta- tion of some sugars. Although there exists signiﬁcant variations in the composition among species, biomass roughly consists of 50% cellulose, 30% hemicellulose, and 20% lignin.  Cellulose material obtained from waste sources  is to degrade. Certain  typically inexpensive but difﬁcult  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

In order to remove this nonbio- degradable component and other impurities from cellulose feedstock, we must pretreat the feedstock with mechanical, thermal, or enzymatic means. Of the many possible products derived from cellulose, ethanol manufactured via microbial fermentation has long captured the attention of many researchers in the following areas of applications:  a  potable ethanol for beer, wine, and distilled beverages,  b  solvent ethanol for laboratory and pharmaceutical applications, and  c  as a fuel additive blend to reduce harmful emissions or as a complete substitute for gasoline. Lactic acid, which is a specialty chemical utilized mainly in the food industry as an acidulent and preservative, ﬁnds use in the chemical processing industry as a metal deliming agent  Iyer and Lee 1999; Schmidt and Padukone 1997 .  A number of processes have been developed to degrade cellulose and to produce ethanol, although successful commercial units to date remain few in number. The most well known is simultaneous sacchariﬁcation and fermentation  SSF , where the bioreactor brings together cellulose, glucose, cellobiose, cellulase enzymes, yeast  but not fungi , and nutrients to produce ethanol  Philippidis 1992 . This process involves a number of different steps all carried out in one vessel. To avoid the setback associated with SSF, another process known as mixed culture and fermentation was developed, where a consortium of fungi and bacteria, or fungi and yeast, rather than simply yeast alone as was in SSF, convert cellulose into ethanol in one combined step  Wilke et al. 1983 . We will review cellulose pretreatment and focus on fungal conversion of cellulose into ethanol, and ﬁnally we will touch upon the economic aspects of ethanol production.  2.1 Fungal Strains  Since the early days of civilization, humans have been practicing converting hexose to ethanol with yeast, speciﬁ- cally Saccharomyces species for alcoholic beverages. Thus, it is only natural that this process technology is proven and quite advanced. More recently, many studies have focused on utilizing bacteria, especially Zymomonas mobilis, to produce industrial ethanol from hexose where taste is not at all a factor. In comparison, converting pentose and other sugars to ethanol is a much more recent development and still faces many unresolved challenges.  The most intensively studied fungus capable of cellulose degradation is Trichoderma reesei, which was originally named T. viride but later renamed in honor of a pioneer in cellulase research, E. T. Reese. This fungus prodigiously produces an excellent ensemble of three major classes of cellulase enzymes that function synergistically to convert cellulose all the way to glucose:  a  endoglucanases, which attack at  b  exoglucanases or glucanhydrolases, which liberate glucose dimer cellobiose from the end of the cellulose chain, and  c   random locations in the cellulose chain,  b-glucosidases, which release constituent glucose monomers from cellobiose and soluble cellodextrins. Many less suitable fungi also produce cellulases, but not necessarily in an optimal ensemble. Although T. reesei is efﬁcient in degrading cellulose, it alone cannot convert cellulose directly to a useful ﬁnal product, unless glucose happens to be the target product. In fact, only a few ﬁlamentous fungi are known to convert cellulose efﬁciently into useful ﬁnal products. The following are among the few ﬁlamentous fungi that are capable of hydrolyzing cellulose as well as converting the sugars liberated from hydrolysis to ethanol or acetic acid: Monilia, Neurospora crassa, and Fusarium oxysporum; the following fungal species are capable of converting xylose to ethanol: Fusarium, Mucor, and Paecilomyces  Singh et al. 1992 . The disadvantage of direct conversion is the slow conversion rate compared to yeast, although conversion efﬁciency can be as high as yeast  Krishna et al. 2001 . Thus, economic considerations generally preclude converting cellulose to ethanol with these fungi. Technical feasibility does not translate to economic feasibility. Table 1 summarizes the different types of fungi responsible for converting cellulose to either ethanol or acetic acid.  2.2 Cultivation Conditions and Nutrient  Requirements  2.2.1 Carbon Source  Since, substrate represents a major cost item  estimated to be anything from 30 to 70% , waste will not be tolerated if the process is to have a chance to be economically viable. Since D-xylose is a major component of cellulosic biomass and since few organisms can convert it at all—and those who do usually do so inefﬁciently, the cellulolytic strains that can convert D-xylose to ethanol represent a great opportunity  Schneider 1989 , and they should be scrutinized further in future studies. Especially notable are the cellulolytic strains of Monilia, which are capable of producing ethanol from both D-glucose and D-xylose. In a study, this fungus converted more than 40% of D-xylose into ethanol in 7 days  Kumar  Table 1 Fungi responsible for cellulose degradation  Organism  Features  F. oxysporum F3  Direct conversion of cellulose into  F. oxysporum DSM 841  Efﬁcient direct conversion of waste  Monilia sp.

Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   et al. 1991 . Like Monilia, the fungus F. oxysporum also successfully converts a variety of carbon sources: glucose, xylose, cellobiose, with a yield of 5.0 – 9.1 g l of ethanol. N. crassa is yet another species that biologically transforms cellulose all the way to ethanol  Singh et al. 1992 . It should be noted that many fungal cellulose degradation studies and fungal cellulase production studies employ well-deﬁned model substrates such as carboxymethyl cellulose  CMC , Avicel  which is more crystalline , or xylan. The synthetic media are further supplemented with minerals and yeast extract. Although deﬁned media tend to yield more reproducible laboratory results, they do not realistically approximate commercial processes. On a related point, these model compounds also serve as substrates for standardized cellulase activity measurements. For example, a common gauge of endoglucanase activity is decreased CMC viscosity. Note that a decrease in the CMC viscosity does not linearly correspond to an increase in the reducing sugar level.  2.2.2 Nitrogen Source  Nitrogen is a major cellular constituent of any organism, and fungi are certainly no exception. Any successful media formulation must carefully balance microorganism’s inherent need for nitrogen. Nitrogen limitation usually leads to slow or no growth or even death of fungi, slow xylose consumption, and retarded ethanol production. Table 2 summarizes the different sources of nitrogen and the typical concentration levels present in fungal growth media in a laboratory setting. In a deﬁned media formulation, typical nitrogen sources are ammonia, nitrates, and urea. In complex media, peptone, tryptone, yeast extract, wheat bran, and an array of protein digests supply other crucial but less understood set of nutrients. Metabolic pathways trace the fate of carbon rather than nitrogen sources. Nonetheless, nitrogen sources’ effect on fungal metabolism can be pronounced. For example, Sale  1967  reports that ammonium ions stimulate glycolysis by counteracting ATP’s inhibition of phosphofructokinase, and they stimulate pentose phosphate pathway by derepressing glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. However, the effects of nitrogen sources are generally not as well understood. From  Table 2 Nitrogen sources in lignocellulosic conversion processes by fungi  Nitrogenous compounds  Concentration  g l   Ammonium nitrate Ammonium dihydrogen phosphate Potassium nitrate Sodium nitrate Urea Peptone Yeast extract Potato protein liquor  Source: Singh et al.  1992 .  1.0 2.0 2.5 2.0 2.0 5.0 0.25  40  economic feasibility viewpoint, supplementing nitrogen from complex sources is undesirable because the practice adds signiﬁcantly to the cost. A future challenge is to eliminate completely the need for nitrogen addition and to satisfy fungi’s nitrogen demand entirely from natural lignocellulosic sources. At least, one would consider cheaper sources of nitrogen.  2.2.3 Minerals and Vitamins  Minerals, trace elements, vitamins, and growth factors play a vital role in the growth of fungi and their biosynthesis of metabolites. There has been no systematic study on the effect of minerals and trace elements such as Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn, Cu, Co, and Mn on growth of fungi and ethanol production by fungi. The present strategy is to provide sufﬁcient quantity of these compounds, estimated based on information gathered from other microbial fermentation, such that they do not become rate limiting. However, it is unclear what constitutes an optimal level. The large number of compounds involved immediately translates to unpractical number of runs. For example, if one were to conduct brute-force experiments by varying one variable at a time, say, each variable set at three separate levels  high, medium, and low , n variables yields 3n combinations if the variables interact with one another, or 3n combinations if the variables do not interact. To appreciate the magnitude of this undertaking, 10 trace compounds  translates to 310 ¼ , 300,000 possible combinations! And  that does not count the unsuccessful runs. Although a sound experimental design can reduce the number of runs, the number of runs required remains utterly unpractical if the variables interact.  2.2.4 Aeration  Under aerobic conditions, the fungi listed in Table 1 grow well but are unable to produce ethanol. On the other hand, under anaerobic or microaerobic conditions, they are able to produce ethanol but grow only slowly. Thus, if one is to pursue cellulose-to-ethanol with a single fungal species, a common strategy is to cultivate fungi ﬁrst under aerobic conditions, followed by ethanol production under anaerobic conditions. For example, in a study utilizing N. crassa, the mold grew ﬁrst aerobically for 48 h. Subsequently, the content of the growth ﬂask was transferred to a special ﬂask that had a capillary opening at the top to exclude oxygen from entering while allowing carbon dioxide to escape as ethanol is produced  Singh et al. 1992 .  Compared to higher organisms, fungi are more susceptible to changes in their surrounding environments. However, the cytoplasmic pH of the fungi tends to change very little over a wide range of extracellular pH. In most prior studies, which have been conducted without active pH control, the initial pH values are within the range of 5 – 6. Both the rate of cellulose degradation and product distribution depend on the pH. For example, Enari and Shihko  1984  report an optimal pH of 5.5 for ethanol production for F. oxysporum, but acetic acid  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   production increased considerably at pH 6.0. For N. crassa, maximum ethanol production occurred in the range of 5.0 – 6.0, which coincided with maximum cellulase activity  Deshpande et al. 1986 .  their growth. In general,  In nature, fungi may be exposed to different environmental conditions that can inhibit the intrinsic enzyme  including cellulase  reaction rate and its deactivation rate both increase with temperature. As temperature increases, the rate of enzyme deactivation surpasses that of enzyme reaction temperature; the apparent enzyme reaction rate exhibits a maximum with respect to temperature. Deshpande et al.  1986  show that N. crassa works best at 378C. It converts more than 90% of cellulose into ethanol within 4 days at 378C. However, above this optimum, the production of end product, such as ethanol, decreases. Table 3 shows optimum pH and temperature needed for the conversion of cellulose by different fungi.  the cellulase activity increases but  thus,  Light plays an important role in the growth of ﬁlamentous fungi. It can hinder or arouse the emergence of mycelia, and sensitivity to light is species dependent. In Trichoderma, the most efﬁcient wavelengths to induce growth are 310, 430, 455, and 480 nm.  3 DEGRADATION OF COMPLEX  MOLECULES  3.1 Cellulose Degradation  In a simplistic summary, there are four major steps in generating bioethanol and other biomass-derived products:  a  generate biomass through photosynthesis,  b  process raw biomass to a form suitable for microbial fermentation,  c  ferment biomass into ethanol  or other products , and  d  recover product and recycle unfermented residual biomass. We will not dwell here on the ﬁrst step that takes place in nature. We present the remaining steps to place in proper perspective fungi based cellulose degradation. Pretreatment of the cellulosic biomass is necessary in the yeast and bacteria based cellulose conversion, because these microorganisms do not easily hydrolyze woods and agricultural residues. If they did, biomass material would not long nor accumulate  and wood would be totally unsuitable as a  remain for  Table 3 Optimum pH and temperature range  Organism  Optimum pH  Optimum temperature  8C   F. oxysporum F. oxysporum F. oxysporum Monilia sp.

In order for organisms to digest biomass efﬁciently and productively, it must be pretreated by mechanical, chemical, or biological means to break down the stable polymeric structure of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. For this purpose, there are presently four major upstream processing technology platforms, and many variations exist around these basic technologies:  a  concentrated acid hydrolysis carried out at low temperature,  b  dilute acid hydrolysis carried out at high temperature,  c  enzymatic  cellulase  hydrolysis, and  d  biomass gasiﬁcation  pyrolysis . The two acid technologies are old developments; whereas, the enzymatic process is relatively newer, and the gasiﬁcation process is much more recent. Enzymatic hydrolysis alone is normally insufﬁcient in degrading cellulose; thus, mechanical and chemical pretreatment becomes necessary. Finally, the fermentation step normally is further subdivided into two steps:  a  conversion of cellulose to glucose and  b  conversion of glucose to ethanol  Blazej and Kosik 1985 . A separate organism is usually responsible for each one of these two steps. Only a few microorganisms in nature can perform tasks in both steps.  Physical pretreatments can be either mechanical or nonmechanical  Fan et al. 1987 . In the mechanical process, the force applied in pretreatment breaks lignocellulosic materials into small highly digestible particles for enzymatic hydrolysis, where soluble enzyme works on insoluble cellulose mainly at the liquid – solid interface and the observed reaction rate is not necessarily limited by the intrinsic reaction rate but by mass transfer. Thus, breaking down particles increases the surface area for reaction. In addition, the nonmechanical pretreatment with high tempera- ture steam causes disruption in the fundamental molecular and crystalline structure of the cellulose.  Ball Milling: Ball milling is one of the best methods to enhance enzymatic hydrolysis. In this process, shear and mechanical forces break down the particle size in order to facilitate the digestion of cellulose. Ball milling, although highly efﬁcient, cannot be operated on a large scale because of the high cost and the lengthy time it takes to break down the molecular structure of cellulose. Like ball milling, two-roll milling also decreases the particle size.  To facilitate digestion, chemical agents such as alkali or acid solutions have long been utilized to pretreat cellulose. Acid treatment increases the reduction power of the reactive groups along the cellulose polymer chain, and cellulose is thus destabilized and rendered more susceptible to subsequent attacks  Fan et al. 1987 . Concentrated acid disrupts the hydrogen bonds between cellulose chains, thus, it breaks the otherwise highly stable crystalline structure of cellulose and dissolves cellulose into a thick, hydrogel-like solution. Cellulose is now in an amorphous state and is readily digested. Addition of water dilutes the acid and rapidly breaks the b-1,4-glucosidic linkage, leading to complete hydrolysis of cellulose to glucose  known as sacchariﬁcation  with an yield that is close to the theoretical value. At the end of sacchariﬁcation, glucose molecules remain intact. Concen- trated sulfuric acid is the acid of choice, although other acids  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.    hydrochloric, nitric, and phosphoric  are also employed in some laboratory studies. In a typical process, ﬁve parts of , 75% sulfuric acid is added to four parts of dried biomass containing , 10% moisture at 508C. This is followed by diluting with water to , 25% acid and holding at 1008C for 1 h. The following schematic shows the fate of cellulose in concentrated acid.  cellulose ! acid complex ! oligosaccharides ! glucose  High temperature dilute acid process works in two stages, with the ﬁrst stage optimized for the more readily hydrolyzed hemicellulose and the second stage’s conditions speciﬁcally tuned for the tougher cellulose. Typical conditions are 0.7% sulfuric acid at 1908C for the ﬁrst stage and 0.4% at 2158C for the second stage. The residence time for each stage is approximately 3 min. A dilute acid process exposes cellulose to acid for a shorter time compared to a concentrated acid process, but only about 50% of the glucose is recovered in a dilute acid process compared to nearly 100% recovery for a concentrated acid process. In hot dilute acids, hydrolysis of cellulose proceeds as follows.  native cellulose ! stable celluloseðhydrocelluloseÞ ! soluble polysaccharides ! glucose  Under certain conditions, alkaline solutions can degrade cellulose by breaking down its long molecular chain at random interchain locations and generate a number of shorter molecules of cellulose. Many alkalis such as metal hydroxides, salts in a strong alkali solution, inorganic salts, a number of amines, and related compounds break the hydrogen bonds between cellulose molecules. Alkalis commonly employed in practice include sodium hydroxide and ammonia. The cellulose structure resulting from alkaline treatment is more amorphous. The swollen cellulose structure allows subsequent enzymatic degradation to proceed more readily because enzyme molecules can gain access to its interior region. Unlike acid treatment, alkaline treatment alone is usually insufﬁcient in releasing constituent monomer sugars to theoretical yield. As a result, it is normally only a  pretreatment step that is followed by an enzyme step. Table 4 shows the sugar yields from different alkali pretreated biomass sources after enzymatic digestion.  Biological degradation of cellulose features prominently in the nature’s carbon cycle. Cellulase refers generally to the enzymes that degrade cellulose. Most known cellulases are of fungal origin. Instead of simply one enzyme, cellulase from most fungi is actually a collection of several distinct enzymes that work synergistically to accomplish the overall task of cellulose degradation. We can classify cellulase-secreting fungi into different groups: brown rots, white rots, and red rots. Unlike white and red rots that degrade cellulose and lignin, brown rots degrade mainly cellulose  Kirk 1976 .  Several microorganisms are known to produce cellulase that hydrolyzes cellulose and hemicellulose. The best known is the ﬁlamentous fungi T. reesei. This microorganism generates at least three well-known enzymes known as:  a  b-1,4-D-glucan glucanohydrolase  an endo-enzyme ,  b  b-1-4-D-glucan cellobiohydrolase  an exo-enzyme , and  c  b-glucosidase  Jeffries 1987 . The most common cellulase, b-1,4-D-glucan glucanohydrolase or Cx, has several constituents. One of these constituents acts as the initiator of cellulose hydrolysis. The second enzyme, b-1,4-D glucan cellobiohydrolase, has two constituents: b-1,4-glucan gluco- hydrolase excises one glucose molecule from the nonreducing end of the cellulose chain, and b-1,4-glucan cellulobio- hydrolase removes two glucose units at a time from the end of the cellulose chain. further divided into two subcomponents CBHI and CBHII. The third class of enzyme, b-glucosidase, does not act directly on cellulose. It is nonetheless important because it hydrolyzes the glucose dimer cellobiose, which yeast cannot ferment, to liberate two glucose monomers, which yeast can readily utilize. Furthermore, cellobiose inhibits cellulase enzymes much more strongly than glucose does. The presence of sufﬁcient quantities of b-glucosidase helps reduce feedback product inhibition.  is  It  Through pyrolysis, biomass is gasiﬁed into synthesis gas. Above 3008C, cellulose is degraded into volatile, gaseous products such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. At intermediate temperatures, decomposition is  Table 4 Yield of sugars from enzyme hydrolysis  5 wt% suspension  of acid and base treated solid based on 100 lb of original material  Conversion of available carbohydrate  Material  Glucose  Poly glucose  Xylanose  Arabinose  G & PG  Pentose  Sugar  Barley Corn stover Cotton gin trash Rice hulls Rice straw Sorghum straw Wheat straw  16 13.8 6.9 7.5 15.6 13.9 14.6  Source: Wilkes et al.  1983 .  2.4 8.1 1.8 1.2 8.3 9.7 3.5  0.21 0.93 0.32 0.01 0.55 1.8 2.07  0.06 0.07 0.05 0.01 0.16 0.23 0.10  47.7 66.4 44.8 27.2 66.9 80.8 57.5  2.2 35.7 6.1 0.3 15.8 22.8 36.5  36.7 64 35.6 21.7 60.8 67.3 53.4  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

In the presence of oxygen, dehydrogenation and depolymerization occur quickly. On the other hand, in the presence of inert substances, depolymerization is slow, and unwanted byproducts appear  Wilke et al. 1983 . In subsequently steps, the synthesis gas is bubbled into a submerged culture, and anaerobic microorganisms  e.g., bacteria Clostridium ljungdahlii  convert into ethanol  Klason et al. 1990 . The chief obstacle of this technology is the high cost of energy  mainly electricity  to heat the biomass, and the low value of the synthesis gas thus produced. Pyrolysis treatment may be economically viable if the fermentation product is valuable.  the pyrolysis product  3.2 Simultaneous Sacchariﬁcation and  Fermentation  In late 1970s, Gulf Oil Company developed a process for simultaneous sacchariﬁcation of cellulose and fermentation of the hydrolysis product to ethanol  Katzen and Monceaux 1995 . Researchers at the University of Arkansas later improved upon the SSF process, summarized in Figure 1. Conceptually, we simply replace the acid hydrolysis step with an enzymatic one and carry out the combined operations of hydrolysis and fermentation in a single reactor to convert biomass into ethanol.  Most reports on the SSF process cite combining two separate reactors for sacchariﬁcation and fermentation into one reactor as an advantage; however, this claim is misleading. Perhaps because the researchers may have simply obtained the cellulase enzyme off the shelf for their studies, they ignore the fact that the enzyme has to be produced separately in an economical fashion  Shin et al. 2000 . In practice, there is an additional cellulase production step, which is nontrivial from the operational and economic  viewpoint. Fermenting biomass with the fungus T. reesei to produce the cellulase needed in SSF is perhaps just as complex and expensive an operation as the cellulose-to- ethanol conversion portion.  3.2.1 Process Description  We give the description of a typical SSF process that aims to recycle solid waste into ethanol, which functions as an alternative fuel. The solid utilized in this process is approximately two-thirds urban waste and one-third pulp mill waste. This solid mixture contains approximately 57% in cellulose. The waste is pretreated, sterilized, and then forwarded to three reactors of 2500 gal each. A culture of mutant fungus T. reesei is inoculated into each reactor. The fungus continuously produces a full complement of cellulases that degrade cellulose. The total residence time for each cellulase production strain is 48 h. Ninety percent of the cellulose introduced into the reactors is degraded into sugars, such as pentose, xylose, arabinose, and glucose. Sub- sequently, the degraded cellulose is cooled in a heat exchanger and sent into 12 reactors for fermentation into ethanol. In this system, one can shut down four reactors while continuing operating the remaining reactors in full swing. The four reactors have an effective residence time of 48 h and are maintained at 408C. The initial feed to the reactors contains 8% of intact cellulose, and the remaining 92% is degraded cellulose, which is hydrolyzed to glucose. The yeast simultaneously ferments the glucose generated to produce 2 – 3.6 w v% ethanol beer slurry. Any unconverted material is recycled back to the process.  In Szczodrak’s study  1989 ,  the ﬁlamentous fungi T. reesei produced the cellulase, and a thermotolerant yeast strain Kluyveromyces fragilis FT 23 carried out the conversion of sugars to ethanol. Table 5 gives a summary of the percentage of ethanol produced.  Figure 1 The SSF process ﬂow chart. From So and Brown  1999 .  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

One unit of enzyme activity  U  is deﬁned as the amount of the enzyme that liberates one moles of reducing sugars  calculated as glucose  per minute under the assay conditions. bGdase stands for endo b-1,4-D-glucanase.  3.2.2 Mixed Cultures and Fermentation  One disadvantage of the SSF process is the number of steps because of the separate steps needed for cellulase generation. In the original SSF process, cellulase, yeast, cellulose, and other nutrient supplements are all thrown into one bioreactor. To reduce the number of steps and cost, a modiﬁed process termed mixed cultures and fermentation has been developed. In this process, more than one organism coexist in the same reactor. While one organism degrades cellulose into sugars, another ferments sugars into ethanol, acetic acid, and lactic acid. This process is more efﬁcient because it eliminates the steps associated with the separation of the enzyme from the products. In the process shown in Figure 2, C. thermocellum sacchariﬁes cellulose into glucose and cellobiose; the same organism also hydrolyzes hemicellulose to xylose and xylobiose. Furthermore, it ferments glucose and cellobiose to ethanol, acetic acid, and lactic acid. The second organism C. thermosaccharolyticum cannot degrade cellulose, but it ferments glucose, cellobiose, xylose, and xylobiose to ethanol, acetic acid, and lactic acid  Wilke et al. 1983 . Mixed culture fermentation is performed under anaerobic conditions, at a temperature of 608C and pH 7. In summary, C. thermocellum efﬁciently degrades cellulose and hemi- cellulose, and C. thermosaccharolyticum then metabolizes xylose to generate ethanol and useful byproducts.  4 ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF ETHANOL  PRODUCTION  Ethanol has been used as a fuel in the United States since the beginning of the 20th century. However, it was quickly  replaced by lower priced gasoline. With the oil crises in the 1970s and increasing environmental concerns, ethanol has regained some appeal as an alternative motor fuel  Linko 1987  or as an additive to be blended with gasoline. Because ethanol reduces vehicle exhaust is environmentally friendly  Bollok et al. emissions, 2000 . To remain successful the cost of production must be low compared to gasoline. In this part, the economic aspect of ethanol production will be discussed.  is an oxygenate that  in that  role,  it  4.1 Economic Analysis of Ethanol Conversion  Technologies  Several technologies have been developed in order to convert efﬁciently cellulose to ethanol. The best-known processes that we discuss in the earlier section are:  a  SSF,  b  dilute sulfuric acid hydrolysis and fermentation, and  c  fast pyrolysis and fermentation. We will brieﬂy describe the dilute sulfuric acid hydrolysis process and the fast pyrolysis process, and then compare the cost and the production of ethanol among the three processes.  Figure 3 illustrates the process of ethanol production by dilute sulfuric acid hydrolysis and fermentation. In the hydrolysis step, cellulose is pretreated in 0.05 g l of sulfuric acid at 1808C. For the purpose of economic comparison, we consider the concentration of sugars yielded to be 103.7 g l. Following hydrolysis, a strain of fungus is responsible for the continuous fermentation of sugars  pentose and hexose  into ethanol  So and Brown 1999 .  Figure 4 shows the Waterloo fast pyrolysis and fermentation process. Its pretreatment step uses 5% hot sulfuric acid. In the fermentation step, fungi degrade cellulose  Figure 2 Mixed culture hydrolysis and fermentation.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   Figure 3 Dilute sulfuric-acid hydrolysis and fermentation process. From So and Brown  1999 .  into sugars while bacteria ferment the different types of sugars  pentose and hexose  to ethanol.  The capital cost analysis given in Table 6 shows that fast hydrolysis, SSF, and acid hydrolysis all have fairly similar total capital costs; the small differences are probably within the error of estimates. Likewise, the operating cost analysis presented in Table 7 also shows similar numbers, albeit the cost of ethanol is the lowest with the SSF process.  4.2 Costs and Beneﬁts of Ethanol Production  The production cost of ethanol must be low for it to be competitive with other existing fuels on the market. Presently, tertiary butyl ether the competition comes from methyl  MTBE  for comparison will shift.

Although from time to time the government may provide tax incentives to jump-start an interest in renewable energy resources—which in practice is synonymous with ethanol the production process must be inherently competitive for it to be sustained in the long run. Table 8 shows a study of ethanol production in California. It gives the price of different feedstocks at near-term and mid- term operation at a large scale. The target price takes into account the debt, and return on investment. The target price decreases from near-term to mid-term, as the technology improves and forces down the production cost. Even when the cellulosic feedstock is inexpensive, conversion into ethanol may be costly. Cellulase enzymes cost 45 cents gal of ethanol and are, therefore, too expensive at the commercial level.  the operating costs,  The critical factors that contribute to the cost of ethanol are  summarized below.   a  The cost of collected feedstock such as municipal and commercial wastes must be low. Thus, the production facilities should be located near the source of biomass material. Furthermore, we can cross the break-even point easier with higher cellulose content in the municipal and commercial wastes.  b  Ideally, the production site should be close to the consumption site to minimize shipping. Ethanol absorbs moisture very quickly and attacks rust spots in the transportation system. This attack provokes corrosion along the distribution system.  c  Because feedstock constitutes a major fraction of the overall cost, we must efﬁciently utilize not just cellulose but all components in the feedstock, especially xylose and lignin. This is especially true for  Table 7 Operating cost comparison with cost ﬁgures expressed in millions of 1997 US$  Fast pyrolysis  Acid hydrolysis  Total capital Annual operating cost Wood Steam Electricity Operating labor Supervisory Maintenance and repair Indirect operating costsa General expensesb Annual capital Charge Total annual operating costs Production cost of ethanol  $ gal   69  11.09 1.15 1.20 0.27 0.04 3.52 3.67 4.40 13.80 39.21 1.57  Source: So and Brown  1999 . a Indirect operating costs include overhead, local taxes, and insurance. b General expenses include administrative, distribution, selling, research, and developments costs.

Furthermore, unutilized residues incur a disposal cost. Strain improvement and recycling of residuals move us closer toward fulﬁlling this goal.  d  For processes that depend on fungi-derived cellulase for cellulose degradation, the cost of the enzyme must be dramatically reduced. Other commer- cially viable processes that utilize cellulase  e.g., stone- washed jean in textile processing  deal with high-valued products and require only partial hydrolysis. In contrast, ethanol production from cellulose deals with bulk commodity products and requires nearly complete hydrolysis. Thus, relative to the price of the product, the cost of cellulase looms high. Advances in biotechnology and genetically engineered organisms offer possible solutions to lower prices for the enzymes.  e  For processes that utilize acid for cellulose degradation, acid poses a signiﬁcant cost. Thus, recovering acid and separating sugars efﬁciently and inexpensively become critical. Advances in separation and membrane technologies should help.  There are several major issues that reach beyond the simple economics in evaluating the future of bioethanol. From the national security standpoint, heavy dependence on imported oil restricts our options in dealing with international matters. Bioethanol should be an integral part of an overall picture showing other forms of energy: natural gas, coal, nuclear, hydroelectric, and, of course, oil. Energy diversity and ﬂexibility is a prudent course that the government should be encouraged to take. Energy plays a central role in the economic health of a society. Finally, production of ethanol from biomass impacts both positively and negatively on the environment. Thinning forests to reduce the risk of wildﬁres generates biomass as the feedstock to ethanol production. By reducing the number of trees, the severity of wildﬁres will be reduced; so will the concomitant emission of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide generated by the ﬁres. When blended with gasoline, ethanol reduces the various harmful emissions:  5 CONCLUSION  The most important commercial product of cellulose degradation is ethanol, which has the potential of ﬁlling the national energy and raw material needs. Furthermore, burning bioethanol has the advantage that it does not contribute to green gas emission from the viewpoint of overall carbon cycle. The present technology derives carbon mainly from corn in a two-step process: hydrolysis of starch to sugar followed by fermentation of sugar to ethanol. In the future, starch is perhaps better saved for food or chemical raw material. To make the process competitive against existing sources of energy and raw materials, we must expand the feedstock to include lignocellulosic biomass. Economics play a major role in deciding which process is ultimately commercially viable. To this end, future research must focus on minimizing unfermented residual biomass, especially lignin and hemicellulose. We must attack an old problem systematically with a multipronged approach and with newly discovered tools in biotechnology: genetic engineering, site directed mutagenesis, and metabolic engineering.

White University of Abertay, Dundee, Scotland, United Kingdom  1  INTRODUCTION  This chapter considers the role of wood-decay fungi in forest ecosystems in the broadest sense, embracing examples of fungi displaying wood and litter degradative activities, even if only transiently. The aim is to emphasize the fundamental signiﬁcance and pervasiveness of wood-decay activity as an integral process in ecosystem functioning. I therefore present a coherent text of diverse themes, but not a comprehensive treatise of any. Each individual topic presented offers an overview of material that has formed the basis of many individual and extensive texts. I have therefore been selective, have tried to avoid lists of species and instead attempted to highlight important ecological activities, features, trends, and concepts. In examining the current status of knowledge, I have on occasion restated familiar works, thus providing pro- gression to more recent research. As a result of my own background and interests examples are mostly drawn from the Northern Hemisphere and information regarding, for example, important tropical biomes, has largely been omitted. The chapter aims to identify some general concepts underpinning wood-decay fungal ecology, and provide guided access to pertinent literature where possible. I conclude by identifying neglected arenas of study and speculating on future research trends. After-all, continued investigation concerned with wood-decay fungi and their role in forest ecosystems is an academically challenging and immensely important process in biological, ecological as well as practical terms.  2 WOODLAND ECOSYSTEMS AS A GLOBAL  RESOURCE  Woodland ecosystems are a major planetary resource, involving about a third of the land surface. Forests and  woodlands provide a habitat for biological diversity. They contribute substantially to the global carbon cycle and are the natural venue for many derived pharmaceutical, practical, and edible products. Woodlands are also an environment for indigenous peoples, and provide much aesthetic and amenity value. Alarmingly, our forests are being lost at a rate of  around 14:6 £ 106 ha=yr due to pollution, disease, and  excessive exploitation  Anon 2001 .  Wood accounts for around 80% of the global organic carbon reservoir. About 70% of woodland net primary production is deposited annually as litter, whilst the remaining 30% accumulates at least transiently as woody biomass  Boddy 1991; Rayner and Boddy 1988 . Below ground, persistent ligniﬁed roots may contribute between 18 and 22% to the total subterranean biomass  Boddy and Watkinson 1995 . Thus, approximately 2 ton of plant biomass may be deposited annually per hectare of forest in temperate regions due to the accumulation of leaf litter, fallen branches and periodically, whole trees. Together with carbon reserves, deadwood litter fall is estimated to retain between 1.1 – 3.7 and 0.1 – 0.8 kg  ha yr  of nitrogen and phosphorus, respect- ively, which serves to immobilize essential nutrients until decay is achieved  Boddy and Watkinson 1995; Dighton and Boddy 1989 . Without decay, nutrient reserves would accumulate and eventually halt ecosystem productivity.  Saprotrophic wood-decay fungi play a pivotal role in the ecology of forests as they are the principal agents of wood and chitin decomposition and hence nutrient and energy ﬂuxes  Dighton 1997 . Unsurprisingly, fungi therefore represent the dominant microbial biomass of the forest ﬂoor and soils of many forest ecosystems, of which 60% may be due to decomposer basidiomycetes. Energy ﬂow through woodland ecosystems is ultimately dependent on a limited mineral nutrient availability. Consequently, the balanced cycling of mineral nutrients within woodlands is central to ecosystem  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

Fungi have been shown to be capable of all major nitrogen transformations except nitrogen ﬁxation, although certain fungi may sequester nitrogen from nitrogen ﬁxing bacteria within wood and fungal sporocarps  Barron 1992 . Fungi can utilize organic  during decay  and inorganic  solubilized by organic acids and siderophores  phosphorus sources and many fungi produce siderophores to sequester limiting supplies of bioavailable iron  Cromack and Caldwell 1992 . Mineral resources are transformed into new fungal biomass, organic acids, and humic substances. Indeed signiﬁcant quantities of nutrients may be immobilized as fungal biomass, and this immobilization has resulted in the adoption of management practices such as burning to eliminate woody debris from forestry sites prior to re-plantation, thereby reducing potential competition for mineral nutrients between fungal biomass and tree transplants  Dighton 1995 . Nutrients sequestered as fungal biomass may be released subsequently as a result of processes such as interactions with other fungal individuals or bacteria, by physical damage or invertebrate grazing and withstanding these, by senescence and death of the mycelium  Boddy and Watkinson 1995 .  The biological diversity contained within woodland ecosystems may be exploited for practical and aesthetic gain. Traditional methods of exploitation have involved collection or cultivation of fungi for food, e.g., trufﬂe fungi, Lentinula edodes  Shii-take , and Pleurotus ostreatus  oyster mushroom  as well as many other edible woodland fungi. Wood colonized by certain fungal species may be employed to generate valuable timber products. For example, “Brown oak” veneer timber   pourriture rouge dur  is produced by Fistulina hepatica colonizing heartwood, Chlorosplenium aeruginascens is used in the commercial production of Tunbridge ware, and wood containing interaction zone lines is turned to produce decorative artifacts. Novel methods of exploitation may involve the application of fungal decay systems to convert a range of renewable lignocellulosics into protein, to bioremediate certain recalcitrant pollutants. Appreciation and understanding of fungal activities, relationships, and distributions in natural ecological contexts may provide insight into methods of searching and screening for useful products and conversion systems, and support the manage- ment and conservation of our valuable global resource. As Hawksworth and Colwell  1992  succinctly expressed as part of the Microbial Diversity 21 statement, saprophytic fungi, in common with other microbes, “are vital to the function of the Earth’s ecosystems and biosphere. As major contributors in biogeochemical cycles, they perform unique and indispen- sable activities in the circulation of matter in the world, on which all larger organisms, including humans, depend. They constitute a genetic resource of great potential for contribut- ing to the sustainable development of the planet as well as human, animal, and plant health. Urgent attention is required  fermentable sugars, and other products, or  to redress our ignorance on many key aspects of their scientiﬁc understanding, their distribution and functions.”  3 THE FUNGAL HABIT  Filamentous fungi are immobile but may achieve motility by virtue of apical growth of hyphae from a supporting substratum. The indeterminate and versatile development of fungal mycelia is directed by interactions with the dynamic abiotic and biotic environments, the latter involving both inter- and intra- speciﬁc interactions between fungi and between fungi and other organisms. As heterotrophs fungi are nutritional opportunists, having evolved an array of optionally programmed developmental pathways to take advantage of changing local circumstances and resource ﬂuxes  Rayner 1996 . Fungi often possess a more restricted degradative repertoire compared with many bacteria, but fungal mycelia possess clear advantages over unicellular or short-chained growth morphs for invading and degrading solid substrata. Fungal mycelia absorb nutrients through a high contact surface area and may penetrate substrata by generation of mechanical pressure and extracellular degradative enzymatic and chemical activity. Mycelia are capable of nutrient translocation to a greater or lesser extent, and therefore have the capacity to support exploration from one nutrient rich source to another, thereby transcending regions of nutrient deprivation.  Highly specialized multihyphal structures such as rhizomorphs and mycelial cords are produced by a variety of wood decay, root pathogenic, and ectomycorrhizal fungi, such as Armillaria spp., Phanerochaete velutina, Hypholoma fasciculare, Phallus impudicus, Tricholomopsis platyphylla, and ectomycorrhizal Leccinum scabrum  see Boddy 1992; 1999; Rayner and Boddy 1988 for review . These linear organs are often evident at the interface of surface litter and soil in boreal, deciduous and tropical woodlands, where they may contribute to stabilizing woodland litter against weather erosion particularly on steep slopes  Lodge and Asbury 1988 . Some may even form networks within the tree canopies of tropical forests  Hedger et al. 1993 . Cords are organs of migration and exploration, with more efﬁcient rates of biomass deployment and translocation of water and nutrients, compared to a more diffuse hyphal network, allowing the individual to transcend vast distances of often hostile regions or inhospitable nutrient deserts. Cords also provide resistance to the damaging effects produced by the soil microbial and microfaunal communities. The voracious opportunistic scavenging and persistent biomass involved may also facilitate nutrient storage. Cord formers are commonly particularly combative and are capable of producing rapid decay in nature, thereby making signiﬁcant contributions to nutrient cycling  Boddy 1999; Boddy and Watkinson 1995; Chapela et al. 1988; Coates and Rayner 1985a .  Cord formation may be promoted by resource depletion  low C:N ratios and nutrients such as copper and calcium , recognition or contact with an antagonist, and reduced water  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   foraging strategies, subject  potential  Rayner and Webber 1984; Watkinson 1999 . Directional growth of cords towards resource baits may possibly be mediated by volatiles or soluble diffusates, and involves coordinated redeployment of mycelial biomass following detection of localized resource base. Different species display different to resource quality, quantity and distribution, biotic factors and microclimate  e.g., Boddy 1999; Donnely and Boddy 1998; Wells et al. 1999; 2001; Zakaria and Boddy 2002 . These linear organs can interconnect heterogeneously dispersed nutrient sources to form coordinated resource distribution networks  Boddy 1999 , and may translocate different nutrients independently even bi-directionally, e.g., certain ectomycorrhizal cords may translocate carbon from tree roots to the growing mycelium, and mineral nutrients and water in the opposite direction.  4 FUNGAL ASSOCIATIONS AND DECAY  Fungal communities occupying forest ecosystems are dynamic and usually diverse, consisting of assemblages of organisms that interact with their surrounding abiotic and biotic environment  Boddy 1992; Rayner and Boddy 1988; Shearer 1995; Widden 1997; Zak and Rabatin 1997 . Nevertheless, the unit community for each resource type often reveals distinct dominants and recurring associations of species during degradation  Dighton 1997; Frankland 1992 . Consequently, prominence has often been given to the sophistication of the nutritional physiology of individuals when attempting to understand or explain fungal community development and successions. Thus, many explanations have centered around leagues of simple substrate groupings, or assemblages of individuals with particular degradative repertoires, simply following changes in resource quality as decay proceeds  e.g., Park 1968 . Such a simplistic view should be considered with caution, as it tends to obscure other important ecological adaptations. It is also suggested that the term succession itself should be used with caution when describing fungal community development, particularly within certain resources such as wood. Terms such as substratum succession  Park 1968 , and resource succession  Frankland 1992  may be misleading in suggesting simple order, thereby obscuring the actual complex multi- dimensional dynamics involved, which may follow a diverse array of optional pathways  Boddy 1992; Cooke and Rayner 1984; Renvall 1995 . However, Frankland  1992  emphasized that the term succession should “accommodate a multi- dimensional phenomenon not a simple linear process” so as to include features such as environmental ﬂuctuation, cycles and disturbance, life-cycle changes, and mycoparasitism without replacement.  But how should fungal ecology be best studied? Synecological studies are valuable in investigating the range and complexities of fungal communities, particularly when underpinned with appropriate sampling techniques and statistical analysis. Considered autecological approaches can  then target speciﬁc hypotheses. However, the indeterminate nature of the fungal mycelium clouds palpable identiﬁcation of an appropriate scale of study, as interactions occur within a continuous hierarchy of spatial and temporal scales  see “Modeling Fungal Decay Communities” . Many patterns identiﬁed at a small scale may become less evident or signiﬁcant at larger scales and vice versa. Furthermore, such features may be relatively insigniﬁcant under a particular set of environmental conditions, but ecological change or disturbance may augment their importance. Thus information derived at a variety of temporal and spatial scales is clearly most likely to contribute to a genuine understanding of fungal ecology. The future challenge will be linking information derived from differently scaled studies in an appropriate manner.  5 DESCRIBING THE ROLES OF FUNGI  Understanding the pattern of occurrence of an organism or population is largely a problem of identifying its realized niche. This task involves the identiﬁcation of not only the space – time occupied by the organism in nature but also the role within that space – time during interaction with the biotic environment  Cooke and Rayner 1984 . In turn, this leads to the problem of how best to classify the role of an organism. Apropos, appreciating the ecological  Andrews 1992; Pugh and Boddy 1988  and nutritional strategies displayed by individual fungi is a useful ﬁrst consideration. Here I will consider the latter only.  An individual ﬁlamentous fungus may achieve an absorptive heterotrophic life-style via biotrophy or necro- trophy, either exclusively or sequentially. Fungal residents of woodland ecosystems exhibiting biotrophy include the  neutralistic to mutualistic to parasitic  endophytes and  mutualistic to parasitic  mycorrhizae, whereas archetypal necrotrophic representatives include certain  parasitic  pathogens and the decay saprotrophs of dead wood- and litter-tissues. These broad activity categories represent convenient but sometimes restrictive descriptors for the ecologist because they may obscure the dynamic nature of the relationship. In the next section I wish to avoid discussion on the boundaries of classiﬁcation schemes, but will consider the wood-decay activities displayed by the associations men- tioned above, so as to illustrate the spatio-temporal complexity and versatility of ﬁlamentous fungi. We as mycologists often focus on the wood-decay activities of true wood and litter saprotrophs, sometimes at the expense of recognizing the prevalence of such activities to other association habits. These association categories merely represent distinct points within a continuum of overlapping activity groups. Therefore, certain individuals may be classiﬁed simply as wood or inhabitants or as mycorrhizae, but others may decay both wood and litter, or may be mycorrhizal but also cause lignocellulose decay. Moreover, the nature of interactions between individuals may alter with life-cycle stage or environmental circumstances. An  litter  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

The speciﬁcity of relationships also varies. Consequently, some fungi will be restricted to a particular biome, geographic area, speciﬁc resource, host species, part or cell-type within a host species. Others may be nonselective, ubiquitous generalists, such as the opportunistic decomposers. Furthermore, mycelial patterns may operate over a range of scales, from an individual pine needle  Kendrick and Burges 1962 , to an entire forest  Smith 1999  or even at a global scale  Arnolds 1997 .  Finally, the heart rot and active pathogenic activities of fungi causing death and decay of standing trees was described in the ﬁrst edition of this text and will therefore not be considered here  Boddy 1991 . The structural, chemical, and microclimatic features prevalent in living wood and the biology, ecology, and epidemiology of fungi causing its decay have been reviewed elsewhere  Butin 1995; Rayner and Boddy 1988; Schwarze et al. 2000; Smith et al. 1992; 1999; Tainter and Baker 1996; Vasiliauskas 2001; Woodward et al. 1998 .  5.1 Endophytes  Endophytes are deﬁned as organisms that grow within a living host plant but not strictly within living cells, thereby deriving nutrition without detrimental symptoms for the host. It is believed that the living stems, twigs, and leaves of most woody plants contain symptomless endophytes, but because of their clandestine nature their prevalence is ambiguous, and identiﬁcation of their presence relies on arduous techniques such as careful isolation from surface sterilized tissues and histological studies  Petrini 1991 . Numerous endophytic species may be potentially allied with an individual host  e.g., 85 different fungal taxa have been isolated from root and stem tissues of Alnus . Moreover, host speciﬁcity varies, with some endophytes displaying little host speciﬁcity  e.g., Phomopsis has been isolated from Buxus, Ilex, Hedera, Ruscus, Ulex, Pinus, Fagus, Juniperus, Fraxinus, and Quercus; and anamorphs of Xylaria isolated from Fagus, Fraxinus, and Quercus  whereas others, such as Peniophora and Vuilleminia comedens tend to be more stringent  Grifﬁth and Boddy 1990; Fisher and Petrini 1990 . Although resident endophytes may not produce disease symptoms as such, their occupation is not without effect on the host.  The leaves or needles of many if not most plants contain fungal endophytes, estimated at a supporting cost of up to 0.5% of annual needle production in the case of conifer needle endophytes  Carroll 1992 . However, the presence of some endophytes, such as Phomposis oblonga in elm stems  Carroll 1991 , may confer a selective advantage on the plant host, either due to secondary metabolite production or conceivably due to competitive exclusion, thereby protecting against pathogen invasion particularly insect attack or larvae development. Some may even be potential pathogens of  other competitor plants, with obvious consequences for the plant community, and have therefore been investigated as a potential biological control system  Leuchtmann and Clay 1988 .  Endophytes may also be involved with initiation of decay following stress or death of host tree tissues. Many endophytes, such as the Xylariaceae and their anamorphs, Daldinia and Hypoxylon spp. and Nodulisporium, are known wood-decay species. Some are observed to fruit extensively on very recently dead fallen logs, or form extensive primary decay columns or strip cankers  e.g., by Eutypa spinosa in European beech  very rapidly following host tree stress, particularly after drought  Hendry et al. 1998 . Observation of such rapid and massive decay column formation has identiﬁed the role of endophytic morphs or latent invaders, distributed as somatically compatible or clonal latent propagules, dispersed within functional sapwood of standing trees. Such propagules may then be rapidly activated due to host stress such as declining wood water content and the growing spatial domains of individual genets may then converge and merge, thereby securing early and spatially extensive infection of dead wood  Boddy 1992; 1994 . Latent presence of propagules in living bark tissues allows rapid and extensive invasion of dead attached twigs or recently felled logs  Grifﬁth and Boddy 1990 . However, detection of propagules does not necessarily implicate that species in initiating decay, as some endophytes have been isolated from host species known infrequently to support decay columns of these latent colonizers  Boddy 1994; Petrini 1991 . This seemingly destructive activity within stressed and functionally redun- dant tissues may also be of ecological advantage to the tree, resulting in natural pruning of expensive nutrient sinks and the subsequent mobilization of nutrient resource.  5.2 Mycorrhizae  Mycorrhizae are mutually beneﬁcial associations formed between the majority of plant and tree species and certain biotrophic soil fungi. The evolution of such a symbiosis provides a means through which the mycobiont can acquire most of its carbon from the photobiont mainly in the form of hexose, whilst donating mineral nutrients, particularly phosphorus and nitrogen, and supplementing plant water requirements. Plant resource acquisition and uptake is enhanced by the presence of a massive mycobiont hyphal surface-area, the activity of which improves mobile resource uptake and is usually solely responsible for uptake of most immobile resource. Afﬁnity for and uptake of nitrogen as ammonia and phosphorus as phosphate is greater for the mycobiont than for the uninfected root. Fungi as mycorrhizal associates may protect against soil pathogens and environ- mental stress and contribute to the survival of most plants within the natural woodland environment  Smith and Reid 1997 .  Some mycorrhizal  fungi show little host speciﬁcity; e.g., Amanita muscaria may associate with conifers such as  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   Pinus and Picea, and with deciduous species such as Betula. Such nebulous speciﬁcity may allow formation of connecting networks, linking individual plants of the same and different species, in source – sink relationships via communal mycor- rhizal fungi. Such conducting and communicating networks may be most signiﬁcant during for e.g., the translocation of nutrients by a more mature plant community, to support the adjacent growth of stressed or shaded seedling plants  Trappe and Luoma 1992 . The ecological signiﬁcance of such resource sharing in sustaining primary production in natural forests, heathlands, and grasslands is currently the focus of research attention  e.g., Simard et al. 1997 . Other mycorrhizal fungi exhibit more strict host speciﬁcity; for e.g., Alpova diplophloeus will only associate with Alnus spp. the development of general successions of Nevertheless, mycorrhizal fungi are often recognized during forest maturation, the individual occupants of which have been associated with r- and s-selected strategies and the nature of the litter resource. The ecological strategies of individual mycorrhizae have important forestry practices with respect to choice of mycorrhiza inoculum for plantation within woodlands at different stages of development.  implications for  Four broad types exist; the vesicular-arbuscular-  VAM  or arbuscular-  AMF , orchid-, ericoid-, and ecto- mycorrhizae. The VAM or AMF generally occupy environments where phosphorus is the main growth limiting nutrient. They dominate forests in tropical climates, but some temperate trees such as sycamore, ash, and poplars have AM, and some such as willow can form both AM and ectomycorrhizal associations. Ectomycorrhizae, however, are supreme in forests on moder, mull, or brown earth soils in temperate regions of moderate latitude and altitude  e.g., Read 1991 , and in relatively infertile soils particularly where nitrogen and phosphorus uptake is curtailed. The ectomycorrhizal fungal mycelium sheaths root cortical cells, forming a Hartig net, and extends through the litter and surface soil layers forming a ramifying network. The substantial mycelial foraging, investment involved implies that prolonged associations tend to occur. The biology, ecology, and biotechnological application of mycorrhizae have been reviewed and described in many excellent texts, for e.g., Allen and Allen  1992 ; Carroll  1992 ; Smith and Reid  1997 ; Podila and Douds  2000 . This section will focus only on the saprophytic activity of mycorrhizae in temperate forest soils.  fungi.  Conventional belief has been that the main function of mycorrhizal fungi is uptake and translocation of mainly immobile mineral nutrients released by free-living sapro- trophs and that saprotrophy is generally lacking in mycorrhizal Indeed, nutrient ﬂow between plant roots, ectomycorrhizae, and interacting saprotrophic non- mycorrhizal species has been demonstrated. For example, the wood-decay species Hypholoma fasciculare evidently lost phosphorus to mycorrhizal Suillus variegatus  Lindahl et al. 1999 , whereas, carbon donation from Pinus sylvestris seedlings to mycorrhizal partner Suillus bovinus was visualized and declined in the presence of the decomposer  species Phanerochaete velutina. This latter species sub- sequently accumulated the labeled carbon source  Figure 1; Leake et al. 2001 . Other examples of competition between mycorrhizae and saprotrophs have been reported  Shaw et al. 1995 . However, the extreme mycorrhizal dependency exhibited by achlorophyllous plants is testimony to the role of fungal associates in translocating carbon to host plants  Leake 1994 . The signiﬁcance of similar carbon donation by  Figure 1  a  Localized proliferation of mycelium of Paxillus involutus in mycorrhizal association with Pinus sylvestris on entering discrete patches of nonsterile forest litter in trays placed in an otherwise homogeneous peat substrate.  b  A digital autoradiograph of the microcosm shown in Figure a, 5 days later.

Thus, it is becoming increasingly evident that, particularly in more acidic woodland environments, mycorrhizal fungi inﬂuence the degradation of leaf litter and woody debris. For example, mycorrhizal activity is stimulated by addition of litter to microcosms, and is maximal in temperate and boreal forests when nutrient litter supply peaks  Leake and Reid 1997; Unestam 1991 . Furthermore, visual evidence of penetration of litter material by ectomycorrhizal hyphae  Leake et al. 2001; Figure 1; Ponge 1990 , and nutrient release measurements following ectomycorrhizal  Suillus bovinus or Thelephora terrestris with Pinus sylvestris  colonization of litter patches  Bending and Reid 1995 , all implicate a saprotrophic role for the mycobiont. Ericoid- and some ecto- mycorrhizal fungi, commonly found dominating ecosystems where nitrogen and phosphorus reserves often reside within accumulated organic matter, are known to produce extra- cellular enzymes capable of decaying complex carbon polymers present in litter and soil, thereby exposing and mobilizing otherwise trapped mineral nutrient reserves  Leake and Reid 1997 . Proteins, amino acids, chitin, nucleic acids, phospholipids, and sugar phosphates all serve as nitrogen- and phosphorus-rich organic materials. Enzyme capacities so far identiﬁed include proteinase, peptidase, chitinase, acid and alkaline phosphatase, phytase, DNAase and RNAase, polygalacturonase, cellulase, xylanase, tyrosi- nase, peroxidase, polyphenoloxidase  including laccase , and ligninolytic activity  see Leake and Reid 1997 . The hydrolytic capability of different individual ectomycorrhizal fungi is diverse  Hutchinson 1990 , some being capable of degrading lignocellulose  Trojanowski et al. 1984 , while others utilize protein for carbon and nitrogen and translocate derivatives to host plants  Abuzinadah et al. 1986 . The latter capabilities are of primary importance where successful mycorrhizal associ- ations are established within ecosystems where the carbon may be supplied to the mycobiont often entirely by the plant symbiont, but available nitrogen and phosphorus supplies are growth limiting to the fungus and then ultimately to the plant host.  holocellulose,  lignin,  and  It has been estimated that maintenance of the mycorrhizal association costs the host between 9 and 28% of the total photosynthetic production annually  Finlay and So¨derstro¨m 1992; Leake et al. 2001; Vogt et al. 1992 . The beneﬁts of such a costly relationship to the photobiont are not only limited to nutrient scavenging and mobilization, and to the saprotrophic release of otherwise unavailable resource, but extend to the ability of the mycobiont to construct extensive and persistent mycelial networks. This allows retention of a mineral budget within a ﬂuctuating and discontinuous nutritional environment, as the mycorrhizal rootlets undergo dynamic degradation and formation, thereby preventing leaching of important nutrient reserves to the surrounding rhizosphere. Leake and Reid  1997  discuss the ecological signiﬁcance of degradative activities of mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal fungi. They argue that the massive mycelial biomass and localized degradative activities produced within  woodlands by mycorrhizal species, together with donation of carbon supply by host plant species, may render the degradative role of mycorrhizal fungi as signiﬁcant compared to nonmycorrhizal saprotrophs, at an ecosystem scale.  5.3 Saprotrophs of Attached and Fallen Wood  and Litter  Saprotrophic fungi are the principle decomposers of nonliving plant and animal detritus in the natural environment, thus recycling chemical elements back to the environment in a form other organisms may utilize. Filamentous fungi usually dominate wood and litter decomposing communities, but under particular ecological circumstances, for e.g., for wood in tropical ecosystems termites may predominate, and under waterlogged conditions bacteria may prevail  Rayner and Boddy 1988 . Other wood and litter residents may include yeasts, bacteria, Myxomycetes and invertebrates such as Insecta, Oligochaeta, Acaria, and Nematoda. These may inﬂuence fungal community dynamics and consequently affect overall decay rates, either via direct interaction, such as antibiosis or grazing of fungal mycelium or spores, or by indirect interaction through impact on the abiotic environ- ment  Dighton 1997; Rayner and Boddy 1988 . Thus, invertebrate activity can increase the exposed surface area for decay activity, may provide channels for mycelial invasion, and also improve aeration. Invertebrate waste and remains will also increase local available nitrogen supplies. Therefore, decay of litter and wood in forest systems are ecologically signiﬁcant and complex processes, produced by intricate and dynamic communities.  5.3.1 Leaf-Litter Decomposition at the Substratum  Community Scale  Estimates for litter production in temperate woodlands range from 3.8 ton ha yr for oak  Quercus petraea  and 5.7 ton ha yr for Norway spruce  Picea abies , although tropical forest litter production may be twice this. Leaves form the bulk of litter material, representing 65 – 75% of the total nonwoody input to forest ecosystems. The overall process of leaf decomposition involves the activities of fungi, bacteria, and animals, to produce a humic product, which becomes incorporated into the mineral soil fraction. Litter decompo- sition may take months  e.g., for Ulmus and Fraxinus excelsior  or years  e.g., for Pinus sylvestris, Quercus, Fagus sylvatica , and may accumulate to form layers if litter production is high and decomposition rates are low. Fungal successions on leaves as they mature, senesce, die and fall, are well characterized and described in detail elsewhere  Andrews and Hirano 1991; Frankland 1984; 1998; Dix and Webster 1995; Kinkel 1991; Ponge 1991 . Unfortunately, investigations tend to focus on the generation of lists of species rather than enquiry into the underlying processes involved.

Fungal spores deposited from the atmosphere must ﬁrst survive stressful conditions, such as desiccation and rapid wetting, and intense UV and visible light as well as other environmental and climatic factors. Subsequently, primary colonizers overcome leaf inhibitory structures and compounds as well as microbial competition, whilst deriving nutrients via absorption of simple atmospheric nutrient supplies and leaf cell exudates.  Phylloplane and litter studies usually involve cultural methods: either plating of macerated portions or washings from leaf tissue, or of surface-sterilized portions  to distinguish between true colonists and nonviable propagules . However, Frankland  1998  cautioned that plate isolations might generate misinformation by merely selecting certain species from a complex of substratum successions. The isolation of certain species may better indicate the prevalence of dormant survival propagules, than their actual activity within the substratum. Direct observation following brief incubation in damp chambers is also useful, or following staining of leaf surface impressions produced in nail varnish or clear sticky tape, or even via electron microscopy. These different techniques have revealed that many incidental spores are in fact not viable, and that the pattern or succession of true colonizers is remarkably consistent for any particular leaf species, despite the diversity of propagules present. Early colonizers tend to be weak parasites or epiphytic saprophytes, e.g., certain yeasts and the cosmopolitan species Aureobasi- dium pullulans and Cladosporium herbarium, their activity often being restricted to the phylloplane until the onset of leaf senescence. The status of some species may indeed change from epiphyte to endophyte or even to weak parasite, depending on the interaction dynamic with the host plant defenses. Endophytes, pathogenic, parasitic or symptomless, may occupy up to 75% of leaves within a site. However, despite the diversity of endophytic genera involved, which may include Phomopsis, Cryptosporiopsis, and Phoma, the dominant mycoﬂora appear to be characteristic of the host species, regardless of host geographical distribution, thereby indicating a close evolutionary relationship between plant and fungus  Petrini 1991 . Frankland  1998  also recognized the inﬂuence of host substrate on fungal species composition. Comparison of successions on different litter and nonwoody plant debris, revealed that the main differences in species composition were the early stage weak parasites, and that the duration of the decay succession, could be attributed to  resource quality, particularly nitrogen content and also to levels of fungi-inhibitory tannins. So, Quercus litter with the highest C:N ratio and tannin content was the slowest litter to decay, whereas Fraxinius with the lowest, produced the shortest decomposition period. In fact, during the decompo- sition of litter collected from a single source, but allowed to decay in adjacent but environmentally dissimilar habitats, similar successions were observed but with different temporal scales  Frankland 1998 .  is never  Senescent leaves together with resident mycoﬂora will eventually fall to the litter or soil surface. Some phylloplane  Aurobasidium spp. and Cladosporium spp.  may fungi persist, and some may even complete their  sexual  life cycle during this phase. However their consequential net decompo- sition may be very low. Litter is rapidly colonized by certain soil-inhabiting fungi  e.g., Penicillium, Trichoderma, and Fusarium spp. , which appear to cause little direct litter decomposition, but may produce signiﬁcant indirect effects, such as synergistically increasing decay rates with litter- agarics. The early ruderal strategists are progressively replaced by saprotrophic communities, which decay leaf surface waxes, pectins, and the lignocellulose complex itself. Later signiﬁcant decay stages are associated with the litter- such as Mycena, basidiomycetes, especially agarics Marasmius, and Clitocybe, which form a signiﬁcant portion of fungal biomass within litter. Such species are capable of cellulose and hemicellulose hydrolysis and often also ligninolysis, as well as the detoxiﬁcation of litter phenolics. Mycena galopus is often prevalent in temperate litter, displaying little resource speciﬁcity and causing typical white-rot, but found in bulky woody debris. Evidently, factors other than lignocellulose decay potential are signiﬁcant in determining the part an individual may play in litter decomposition. For example, explanation of an apparent paradox co-existence of two litter saprotrophs M. galopus and Marasmius androsaceus both utilizing the same resource but possessing different colonizing vigor, involved microclimatic factors and another trophic level, i.e., preferential grazing by a mycophagous collembolan  Frankland 1998 . Certain basidiomycetes show preferences for particular to the stimulatory effect that certain litter ﬂavenoids have on their growth. So, for example, the growth of certain Clavaria, Collybia, Marasmius, and Mycena species is stimulated by addition of minute quantities of taxifolin glycoside to growth media. However, differences between representative com- munities occurring on angiosperm and coniferous litter, were attributed more to pH than to leaf phenolic properties  see Carlile et al. 2001 for references . Agarics are also most signiﬁcant within deeper litter layers, where the improved moisture regime is conducive to basidiomycete growth and they are sheltered from ﬂuctuating climatic conditions. The signiﬁcant involvement of small soil animals in nutrient cycling, promoting litter decomposition via leaf fragmenta- tion, nitrogen input, and detoxiﬁcation of phenolics is reviewed elsewhere  Dix and Webster 1995; Ingham 1992 .  types, possibly due in part  litter  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

The heterogeneous and polymeric nature of wood together with low nitrogen and phosphorus content limits decay of woody resources to certain fungi and less signiﬁcantly to a few bacteria.  The 1980s and early 90s saw major advances in our understanding of the ecology of wood-decay fungi. This is comprehensively reviewed in several extensive and excellent texts  Boddy 1992; Rayner and Boddy 1988; Renvall 1995 . Here I will simply present a brief outline. Investigations of indeterminate fungal growth within most natural environ- ments present the ecologist with numerous constraints and practical challenges. However, the colonization of wood by fungi, particularly the higher fungi, provides the ecologist with an unparalleled opportunity to map the spatial activity domain of individuals in situ. Such systems can therefore provide a superb experimental system and conceptual framework for mainstream ecology. Competitive interactions dominate fungal communities within wood  Boddy 2000 . Consequently, distinct territories prevail and are delineated within the wood by the production of antagonistic reactions such as pigmented zone lines, and colored activity domains indicated by different types of decay. Moreover, careful examination of wood sections may also reveal relic zone lines indicating the former occupants of woody domain. The community structures of colonized wood at various stages of decay have been mapped and the features affecting community development have been studied, using an astute but simple method based on these principles  Boddy 1992; Rayner and Boddy 1988 . Essentially the technique involved sectioning wood, and recording the delineated boundaries of spatial domains occupied by individuals, prior to their isolation onto agar media. Isolates were identiﬁed and somatic compatibility of Basidiomycota and Ascomycota assessed using pairing techniques to map the presence of individuals. Interspeciﬁc pairing studies were used to assess antagonism and to rank species within a hierarchy of combative ability, to aid inference regarding the order of colonization and replacement  succession  of individuals. Thus, a 3D map may be constructed by aggregating information from serial wood sections. This basic method has also been complemented with other studies involving manipulation of drying regime, temperature, water potential, and gaseous environment. The approach has been used to study the community structure of attached branches and twigs of oak  Quercus petraea and Q. robur , Ash  Fraxinus excelsior , beech  Fagus sylvatica , and birch  Betula pendula   Boddy 1992; Grifﬁth and Boddy 1991a; Rayner and Boddy 1988 . The majority of wood-decay studies have been concerned with basidiomycetes from early stages of decomposition, and with ascomycetes, moulds, and zygo- mycetes particularly from later decomposition stages   Chapela 1989; Crane et al. 1996; Crawford et al. 1990; Lumley et al. 2000; Rayner and Boddy 1988 . Host-wood species, physico-chemical properties, and microclimate govern the basic fungal community dynamics, as does the prior history of the substratum  Barron 1992; Butin and Kowalski 1986; Chapela et al. 1988; Grifﬁth and Boddy 1990; Keizer and Arnolds 1990 . Water distribution and its reciprocal relationship with aeration, were identiﬁed as principal determinants of colonization patterns  Rayner and Boddy 1988; Grifﬁth and Boddy 1991b . Thus, the moisture relations of living trees inhibit fungal growth and decay by the majority of for certain pathogenic and endophytic species. However, to overcome this, some fungi apparently employ a strategy of active wood desiccation to achieve appropriate conditions for establishment and decay  Hendry et al. 1998 .  fungi, except  The decay process often commences in the standing tree, in attached lower or stressed branches  Rayner and Boddy 1988 . Fungi may gain access either through wounds, tissues following microbial or stress damage or via lenticels or leaf scars. Studies have indicated that pioneer species such as Stereum gausapatum, Phlebia rufa, Phellinus ferreus, Exidia glandulosa, and Vuilleminia comedens in oak or Daldinia concentrica, Hypoxylon rubiginosum, and Peniophora limitata in ash, can colonize living or recently dead wood. The host tree may instigate a response to this invasion, by accelerating localized premature heartwood tissue formation, which contributes to restriction of the invading front. The identiﬁcation of massive decay columns comprising a single individual extending for several meters along branches known to have been dead for a single growing season only, indicated the involvement of invaders  see “Endophytes”  initially distributed within functional sapwood as “dormant” hyphal fragments or propagules. Mycelial growth and colonization would then activate from multiple inoculum sites, following stress alleviation for the fungus  usually drying sapwood , imposed by stress aggravation for the host. Ramets of an individual genet could then grow and unite by anastomoses thereby forming extensive decay columns apparently occupied by a single individual. Secondary invaders such as Coriolus versicolor, Phlebia radiata, Sterium hirsutum, and Peniophora lycii in oak, and Radulomyces conﬂuens in ash, could invade and replace pioneers in already dead or decaying wood.  latent  Decomposing dead wood gradually releases sources of nutrients  Harmon et al. 1994 . Exposed stumps of felled trees, fallen branches and twigs, or cut timbers may become rapidly colonized by large numbers of individuals of fairly nonselective saprotrophs, thereby forming numerous smaller decay columns. Community structure and development is affected by the degree of exposure, contact with the ground or with other wood, and is inﬂuenced by microenvironmental conditions and the arrival mode of individuals. Exposed surfaces may be colonized by established air-borne spores of Coriolus versicolor, Bjerkandera adusta, Stereum hirsutum, Chondrostereum purpureum basidiomycetes or ascomycetes in the genus Hypoxylon or Xylaria commonly on hardwoods.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   Such a mode of establishment often produces slower expansion of decay columns compared to that from ground contact, presumably due to the more stressful drying regimes. Buried or ground contact wood may be colonized by soil- derived spores, mycelia, or cords. Later decay stages may involve Mycena galericulata and Pluteus cervinus on hardwoods, or Tricholomopsis rutilans and Paxillus atrotomentosus on conifers. On very wet, well-decayed wood Dacrymycetales such as Dacrymyces stillatus, or discomycetes such as Mollisia cinerea may occur.  That different individuals produce different types and rates of decay is now evident  Worrall et al. 1997 . Furthermore, the spatio-temporal combination of extracellular enzymes secreted by a fungus is dependent not only on its evolutionary heritage, but also on the local environmental and biotic conditions  Grifﬁn 1994; White and Boddy 1992a,b . Few studies have related community structure and development with the decomposition process itself. This seems to be a little imprudent as both are obviously intricately linked. Notable exceptions  Coates and Rayner 1985a,b  have demonstrated that inoculation via large numbers of individuals produce slower net decay rates when compared with that for low spore loads, probably due to expression of alternative metabolic pathways related to antagonism between numerous small domains. However, several authors have observed enhanced decomposition rates by mixtures or sequences of fungi  Boddy et al. 1989; Deacon 1985 .  5.3.3 Community Studies at the Forest Ecosystem  Scale  is a traditional method of  Direct examination of twigs, branches, and logs for fruiting structures surveying for basidiomycete and ascomycete activity. But the ﬂora detected using this approach is often very different to that isolated by plating wood portions from interior wood regions. Inferences regarding community dynamics if based on sporophore surveys should be made with extreme caution as their appearance may bear little relationship to the arrival, activity or decline of the supporting mycelia and the relationship will vary for different individuals. Thus, the time taken for the mycelium to derive sufﬁcient resource to devote to sporophore production may be one or more seasons but may be evident only temporarily and the active mycelium of some fungi may not produce sporophores until their ﬁnal stages of colonization. Some, such as Ganoderma and Fomes produce perennial fruit bodies, which may survive for several years, whereas others may produce seasonal and or ephemeral fruit bodies. For example, soft-rot fungi such as Chaetomium spp. are prevalent colonizers frequently only detected via plating techniques. Similarly, the dominant ectomycorrhizal species Tylospora ﬁbrillosa in a Sikta spruce plantation was not detected in sporophore surveys, and species indicating most abundant fruiting represented only a very small abundance in association with sampled roots  Taylor and Alexander 1991 . Therefore the phenology  climate and time of appearance  and abundance of fruit-bodies for different species must be  considered when interpreting survey data. However, careful experimental design and statistical treatment of such data can provide the ecologist with a useful approach to investigating factors inﬂuencing fungal community dynamics and decay at the forest ecosystem scale.  Microclimate, substrate quality determined by host species and decay stage, and forest history are cited as being the most signiﬁcant determinants of fungal community structure in decaying wood  Lindblad 1998; Lumley et al. 2001; Rayner and Boddy 1988; Sippola and Renvall 1999; Vogt et al. 1992; Zhou and Hyde 2001 . Other factors affecting species compositions include soil chemical properties  Ruhling and Tyler 1990 , and vegetation type  Wasterlund and Ingelog 1981 . Furthermore, the initial heterotroph community  bark beetles, ambrosia beetles, moulds, or decay fungi  has been found to inﬂuence decomposition or carbon ﬂux in freshly cut Douglas ﬁr  Progar et al. 2000 . Multivariate analysis of survey data, such as detrended correspondence analysis  DCA , can indicate the relative importance of these variables for community structure and development within forest ecosystems. In dead-wood, decay state and microclimatic stress have been identiﬁed as most inﬂuential with some impact of soil conditions  Heilmann-Clausen 2001 . Cluster analysis and ordination of microfungus communities in white spruce  Picea glauca  and trembling aspen  Populus tremuloides  fallen logs in disturbed and undisturbed boreal woodland sites revealed tree species to be most inﬂuential, followed by stage of decomposition and moisture content  Lumley et al. 2001 . From the foregoing, the importance of appropriate moisture regime for decay community develop- ment is evident, indeed particularly wet forests have revealed relatively depressed respiration and decomposition rates  Progar et al. 2000 . Community analysis can also suggest general trends relating to species diversity and community development. Communities develop relatively quickly and predictably at early decay stages, but become slower and more diversiﬁed at later stages as the impact of ﬂuctuating microclimatic stress become more signiﬁcant due to increasing wood porosity  Heilmann-Clausen 2001 . Bio- diversity is greatest in undisturbed deadwood, and tends to increase as decay proceeds  Lumley et al. 2001; Norden and Paltto 2001; Renvall 1995 . Moreover, some late-stage decay species may be prone to local extinction due to strict successional associations formed between certain species  Niemela¨ et al. 1995 .  The DCA of sporophore data from decomposing conifer trunks in northern Finland indicated the development of regular successions of wood-decay fungi. Differences observed among successions were due to associations with the prevailing microclimate and dependent on the resource capture strategies and combative ability of individuals  Renvall 1995 . In short, environmental stress created succession pathways for speciﬁc saprotrophic groups. Such an inference is very much in accordance with the concept presented by Cooke and Rayner  1984 , that community development pathways are initiated under varying degrees of high abiotic stress and or low stress conditions following  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   disturbance and is subsequently directed by four inﬂuences; disturbance, stress aggravation, stress alleviation, and intensiﬁcation of combat  Boddy 1992 .  6 FUNGAL DIVERSITY, ENVIRONMENTAL  CHANGE, AND CONSERVATION  Biodiversity is generally considered to be fundamental to ecosystem functioning and stability. Thus, if this tenet is extrapolated to fungi in forest ecosystems, fungal biodiversity is critical to global geochemical cycles. A well-cited global estimate for fungal biodiversity is in the range of 1.5-M species  Hawksworth 1991; 2001 . However, at a local level, appropriate monitoring of fungal diversity can identify ecological and climatic trends, provide a database for spatio- temporally predictive biodiversity models, and inform appropriate conservation strategies at both the regional and global scale  Arnolds 1997 .  Most  local diversity studies are based on survey of conspicuous fruit bodies of higher fungi, either represented as presence, number, or biomass within a plot. Diversity studies of ephemeral and sometimes sensitive fruit bodies will only represent a partial account of the resident fungi. Nevertheless, such studies are often valid because of their ease of  usually nondestructive  analysis over extensive sampling domains. Fruit body surveys are further justiﬁed because of the ecological signiﬁcance of spore dissemination for the establishment of new genets, and due to the involvement of sporocarps in soil mineralization processes owing to developmental regulation of extracellular enzyme activities  Ohga et al. 1999 . Moreover, the fruit bodies of many species are a valuable edible resource. However, sporocarp inventories of species with varying resource allocation to reproduction, especially for comparison of taxonomically and ecologically different groups, are fallible as a bioindicator of diversity. Thus, ruderal strategists are generally likely to fruit more frequently and transiently than combative strategists. Moreover, sporocarp productivity of different species are known to vary spatially  clustered or dispersed and associated with distributed substrata , temporally  yearly, seasonally or weekly , can mature at differing rates and persist for varying time periods  Egli et al. 1997; Vogt et al. 1992 . Fruiting may also be inﬂuenced by environmental factors such as temperature and precipitation, natural and artiﬁcial amend- ments to soil and by local or nonlocal ecological disturbance  Straatsma et al. 2001; Watling 1995 . In the case of certain mycorrhizal fungi fruit body development is affected by host genotype, age, provenance, edaphic factors, climatic factors, and supporting photosynthetic activity  Dix and Webster 1995 . The relationship between individual visible fruiting structures and mycelium activity within substrata is therefore varied and complex, and considerable disparity has been identiﬁed between the two in numerous studies  Cotter and Bills 1985; Gardes and Bruns 1996; Yamada and Katsuya 2001 . Notably, only about half of the ectomycorrhizal  community has been indicated by production of conspicuous epigeous fruit bodies  Dahlberg et al. 1997; Peter et al. 2001 . Sampling plot size, frequency, and distribution are also likely to inﬂuence the data set, as different ecological groups will operate over a range of spatio-temporal scales  Newton and Haigh 1998; Schmit et al. 1999 . Indeed, it has been suggested that different ecological guilds would require differently sized and spatio-temporally distributed sampling protocols  Villeneuve et al. 1991 . To compound such problems, Tofts and Orton  1998  declared that 21 years of recording species accumulation was insufﬁcient to reliably estimate  extrapolate  the fungal biodiversity of the site, as the species accumulation-time curve had not yet started to plateau. At a practical level, the quality of a data set is even dependent on the expertise of the collector  Straatsma et al. 2001 . However, sporophore surveys may be justiﬁed as a suitable method for warning of species disappearance due to detrimental external factors within a site, as evidence suggests that fruiting may be more sensitive to environ- mental stress than survival of the supporting mycelium itself  Termorshuizen and Schaffers 1991 .  Despite these limitations evidence accrues, particularly from Europe and more recently the United States, suggesting that fungal biodiversity is in decline. The likely causes of decline are due to habitat loss and or pollution. Harvesting of wild edible mushrooms is believed to have little detrimental effect on fungi, except where collection has involved damaging or exhausting the mycelium, or trampling or raking the soil  Arnolds 1995 . Nevertheless, the environmental impact of large-scale commercial harvesting remains a contentious issue. Fungal habitat may be lost, with implicit reduction of fungal species diversity, either by deforestation, or because of commercial forestry management practices, such as the conversion to less-mixed or monoculture plantations, stand felling of a particular age, and the removal of course woody debris  Fridman and Walheim 2000; Høiland and Bendiksen 1996; Lindblad 1998; Norden and Paltto 2001; Ohlson et al. 1997; Straatsma et al. 2001 . Red-List  endangered, vulnerable, or rare  species may be particularly sensitive, often showing a preference for large diameter logs in late decay stages, of which managed forests are largely deﬁcient  e.g., Humphrey et al. 2000; Kruys et al. 1999 .  Pollutants such as lead, sulfur dioxide, ozone, and oxides of nitrogen  direct or as acid precipitation  are known to affect biodiversity  Wainwright and Gadd 1997 . Ectomycorrhizal communities are particularly threatened by pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and NHx, probably due to forest soil acidiﬁcation and nitrogen input, thereby rendering any potential mycorrhizal association less advantageous to the host plant community  Arnolds 1995 . Elevated sulfur dioxide levels are known also to affect the phylloplane community, although some pigmented species may be less susceptible, thereby favoring their population growth  Magan 1993 . The resulting impact on community interactions may have implications in the dynamics between pathogens and saprotrophs and the consequent natural limitation of plant diseases, and even on the subsequent decay rates of litter and  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   hence nutrient cycling  Newsham et al. 1992 . Similarly, high levels of radioactivity occurring around the Chernobyl site have produced altered fungal community structures  Zhdanova et al. 1994 .  Considering the absolute and relative diversity, funda- mental ecological importance, some host-speciﬁcity and -exclusivity, and established and potential biotechnological  Hawksworth and Colwell 1992; signiﬁcance of Oberwinkler 1992 , limited conservation seems unjustiﬁed and surprising. For example, only four fungal species are protected by UK law, comparing pitifully with over a hundred ﬂowering plants  Marren 2001 .  fungi  their  7 MODELING FUNGAL DECAY  COMMUNITIES  From the foregoing it is evident that signiﬁcant limitations exist in both ﬁeld- and laboratory-based studies of wood-decay fungal communities. Moreover, much of the information reported is qualitative and at best semi- quantitative. A complete understanding of the natural environment based on observation alone is probably unattainable due to its complexity, the appreciation of which may be approached in several ways. Conventional methods often involve an empirical or ﬁeld based approach to investigate the activities of individual decay fungi and their temporal relationship with the abiotic and biotic environment. These may be analyzed statistically or further complemented with laboratory experiments. More rarely, fungal ecological investigation may involve the development of conceptual and experimental models based on general ecological theory  Carroll and Wicklow 1992 . The use of conceptual representations or models has been instrumental in expanding the boundaries of our knowledge and understanding of the natural environment. A model in its broadest sense is a partial, simpliﬁed version of a real entity or system. The main value of models is that they allow us to ﬁrst represent and then make measurements and predictions that would be otherwise awkward. Theoretical or mathematical models based on experimentally observed characteristics of fungi are increas- ingly being used, for e.g., in formulating hypothesis about their population dynamics and epidemiology  which will not be considered here and the reader is directed to Worrall 1999 . A particular advantage of linked models is the interplay between quantitative experimental data and theoretical predictions. It is therefore possible to test and validate the theoretical model by predicting the result of, for e.g., changing an environmental factor in the experimental system and then observing whether the predicted result occurs.  The development of theoretical or mathematical models to describe any real ecological system will always be contentious, given the inevitable simpliﬁcation or reduction of the system inherently required by such an approach. However, appropriate theoretical models should allow inferences to be made regarding the underlying mechanisms  or processes driving ecological systems. Thus, the biological processes that regulate and generate patterns of organisation in fungal communities may be elucidated through the understanding of the interactive and feedback control steps involved within a working theoretical model. So, as Moorhead and Reynolds  1992  reasoned, “the process of developing a model tests our understanding of the system, identiﬁes areas of uncertainty and, importantly, provides a means of examining alternative conceptual frameworks.” Furthermore, mycology may offer important systems to study and test the suitability of general ecological theories and laws usually developed for determinate organisms, for application to indeterminate biological behavior. Rare examples of this approach include consideration of the ecological strategies of individual fungi  Andrews and Harris 1986; Boddy 1992 , and testing the relevance of Island theory, and the Species- area curve, to certain fungal communities  Andrews et al. 1987; Newton and Haigh 1998; Wildman 1987 .  The majority of natural environments display both spatial and temporal heterogeneity or patchiness in terms of both abiotic and biotic factors, which may profoundly effect the functioning and development of fungal communities  Ritz and Crawford 1999 . So models that address environmental heterogeneity are the most likely to produce realistic theory. Certain distinctive biological attributes displayed by the fungal form should also be incorporated into any reasonable theoretical model. Features such as indeterminacy, inter- connectedness, variation, and versatility  genotypic and phenotypic plasticity , all contribute to varying degrees and at different scales, to the success of ﬁlamentous fungi within the natural heterogeneous environment. As indeterminate life-forms the growth of ﬁlamentous fungi is potentially unlimited, unlike that of determinate life forms such as unicells and animals, which possess genetically programmed limits in both space and time. However this statement may be an oversimpliﬁcation of the fact, as the longevity of indeterminate individuals and species does vary. Ruderals, for e.g., may persist only brieﬂy for a few weeks, whilst some such as Ganoderma and Armillaria are renowned to persist for years. Nevertheless, the indeterminacy displayed by eucarpic fungi facilitates success within a heterogeneous environment, as hyphae have the potential to temporally sustain or spatially extend great distances, often spanning inhospitable conditions in time or space to encounter new resource bases. Indeterminacy may generate versatile responses to environmental unpredictability in a way that determinate organisms can only engage with by way of evolutionary selection or social behavior.  Indeterminate and modular  life forms show some analogies and have sometimes been treated as theoretically equivalent  Trinci 1978; Prosser 1994 . However, modular organisms develop by repeated addition of the same organizational unit to a pre-existing one, whereas mycelia are nonadditive as they operate as dynamic ﬂow systems with branching, anastomosing and radiating components com- municating at different scales and to varying degrees  Rayner 1996 . Therefore, the temptation to apply modular models,  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   which incorporate iterative steps at a single reference scale, to indeterminate systems, should be considered with caution. The challenge will be to develop modeling frameworks that can link biological processes operating over multiple scales and with varying constancy, to large-scale or ecosystem behavior. Developing and therefore understanding this complexity would make a major contribution to both fungal and general ecoevolutionary theories.  7.1 Modeling the Growth of Hyphae and Mycelia  Many mycological models have attempted to represent and explain the growth and development of hyphae and mycelia in relation to their abiotic environment. The reader is directed to Ritz and Crawford  1999  for a review of some of the experimental approaches and mathematical models devel- oped to date, and so these will not be considered in any detail here. Most have focussed on the foraging and space-ﬁlling properties of mycelia developing on resources distributed discretely or as gradients. Reaction-diffusion models have been derived to reﬂect hyphal growth and branching  Regalado et al. 1996  and different colony morphologies  Davidson et al. 1996 . More recently a simple stochastic model accommodating some biological processes  inhibition by toxic metabolic products and nutrient uptake  was able to reproduce a variety of fungal growth patterns observed on solidiﬁed media  Lopez and Jensen 2002 . However, there is a paucity of theoretical models that accommodate environ- mental topography, translocational source – sink relationships, and exploitation vs. exploration growth morphs, either individually or in combination. In an attempt to address these issues, work is currently being undertaken to develop a  generic spatially explicit model adopting a process-based approach, in which the fungal individual is deﬁned by a set of measurable traits that describe physiological processes such as nutrient uptake, redistribution and growth  Figure 2 . Each individual may be described by a characteristic set of traits and therefore community diversity may be accommodated within the model. Being spatially explicit where biomass is located in cells on a discrete spatial grid, the model permits regions of mycelia to interact within a neighborhood and change according to the local environment and context. Thus, the ethos of the modeling framework is that any system can be described by a set of processes that can approximate the system. By linking these processes to parameters that may be measured experimentally  physiological traits , a mechanistic understanding of those parameters inﬂuencing the overall organisation of the system can be obtained.  7.2 Modeling Fungal Community Dynamics  Modeling approaches for fungal communities, have received far less attention, perhaps because this is a most ambitious project, summed-up by Frankland  1998  as “unravelling the unpredictable.” Indeed, the work of Halley et al.  1996  represents one of the few attempts to model interactions within a multispecies fungal decay community. In this work, a computer based simulation model known, as a “cellular automaton” was developed to predict the decomposition of wheat straw by four saprotrophic fungi. The model was based on real experimental data obtained by Robinson et al.  1994  during studies on resource capture by interacting fungal colonisers of straw. Although this model was capable of reproducing some of the behaviors exhibited during the  Figure 2  a  Image showing the underlying soil pore space derived from real data using a CAT scan—with white to black scale representing pore to solid respectively.  b  Image showing the resulting fungal biomass gradient distribution obtained from the theoretical model with the mycelium growing from a single point and resource  bottom right hand corner  with white to black scale representing high to low biomass, respectively. The model is based on a set of biological processes, intended to characterize any fungal individual. By linking these processes to parameters that can be measured experimentally, a mechanistic understanding of which parameters are inﬂuencing the overall organization of the system can be obtained  Falconer R, Bown J, Crawford JW, and White NA, unpublished data .  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   experimental study, validation of the model was only possible on a qualitative basis. Furthermore, the model admittedly ignored important aspects of the fungal community such as sporulation and the coordinated behavior of the mycelium.  local and nonlocal  More recent modeling studies have attempted to examine and accommodate the complex and coordinated behavior exhibited by indeterminate mycelia. A stochastic cellular automaton for modeling the dynamics of two-species microcosm communities of differing patch size, revealed the signiﬁcance of interactions in generating the emergent behavior of mycelial systems  Bown et al. 1999 . Importantly, the experimental system allowed for detailed quantitative spatial analysis of the community. This revealed that despite the predictability of the ﬁnal interaction outcome irrespective of patch size, the ﬁner- scale dynamics were highly dependent on non-local interactions  Bown et al. 1999; Sturrock et al. 2002 . Furthermore, experimental studies indicate that fungi occupying large domains commonly display a higher combative success compared to those occupying smaller domains when challenged by the same species, and in vitro that younger mycelia may be less combative than more mature growth  Holmer and Stenlid 1993; Stahl and Christensen 1992 . Consequently, despite the beneﬁts of in vitro interaction studies in understanding the factors that inﬂuence the community dynamics of fungi, a major limitation exists in how such small-scale studies relate to the behavior at larger community scales. At larger scales it is probable that contrasting emergent behaviors may arise  because individuals in a group or patch behave differently to individuals that are isolated. Processes such as modiﬁcation of the environment, resource translocation and hyphal network- ing or anastomosis  Rayner 1996  may all inﬂuence community development. Issues relating to scale have been a central problem in ecology over the last ﬁfty years. Nevertheless, the importance of appreciating the relationships across different scales should be emphasized, as under- standing and predicting large-scale ecosystem events, will have origins in and consequences for ﬁne-scale phenomena  Levin 1992 . Therefore, in the development of a complete understanding of fungal ecology it is necessary to address issues relating to scale and to adopt a hierarchical framework  Allen and Hoekstra 1992; Swift 1976 .  In vitro mycelial interaction studies, particularly those evident on agar media, have often formed the basis of understanding or predicting ex situ fungal community dynamics. Furthermore, these have often centred on the pair-wise interaction between a limited number of individuals under experimentally deﬁned environmental conditions  Boddy 2000 . Data produced from combative interaction studies are often used to rank species in order of their combative ability, and hence to indicate sequences of fungal colonisation in the ﬁeld. Correlation between antagonistic behavior in artiﬁcial culture and in the natural environment is mixed, and may be related to the spatial or temporal scale at which the data are collected or aggregated. Nevertheless, such studies represent a valuable approach to understanding fungal ecology, providing that any limitations are recognized,  Figure 3  a  –  c  Example maps showing the spatial distribution of fungal species in a 3 £ 3  equal proportion  tessellated agar tile interaction array at the onset of the experiment.

According to general ecological terminology combative hierarchies may be either transitive  following a strict linear order of hierarchy  or intransitive  no strict linear hierarchical order   Boddy 2000 . Consequently, predicting the interaction outcome of more than two species may become extremely difﬁcult, if not impossible, if the species under investigation display an intransitive hierarchy  White et al. 1998 . Thus, the expansion from two-species interactions to three or more species may allow for the emergence of “higher-order interactions” involving greater complexity and even different biological phenomena, often resulting in shifts in interactive functioning  Culver 1992 . Furthermore, the initial spatial conﬁguration of three-species communities of equal inoculum and patch size, has been shown to impact on community development and reprodu- cibility, and may contribute to the persistence of individuals which would otherwise be expected  based on binary pairings  to be eliminated from the system  Figure 3; Sturrock et al. 2002 . In addition, fungal individuals can often display a variety of responses when subjected to ostensibly the same set of conditions  Figure 3; Halley et al. 1996; Rayner et al. 1995; White et al. 1998 . Such stochasticity may be interpreted as offering the mycelium an ecological advantage within a dynamic and unpredictable heterogeneous environment. The complex stochastic and sensitive nature of community interactions is particularly evident within experimental community systems involving more than two species, which tend to demonstrate more heterogeneity among replicates with the same initial arrangement compared to binary-pairings  Sturrock et al. 2002; White et al. 1998 . Agreement between agar based studies and those occurring in natural substrata is also likely to be inﬂuenced by environmental complexity  Boddy 2000 . Water potential, gaseous regime, temperature, and resource quality have all been shown to signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the outcome of interactions. Importantly, the sensitivity of the interaction outcome may not be solely associated with inﬂuence on colony extension rate, and that improved growth temperature regimes are not necessarily conducive to superior combative physiology  Sturrock et al. 2002 .  From the above the limitations implicit within fungal models are clear. Frankland  1998  remarked that community development would become “predictable only when the mechanisms are understood and can be related to the multivariate situation.” However, the contrary approach should be considered, explicitly that the process of developing a working model, will highlight the important underlying biological processes and mechanism driving community development, and identify new hypotheses for further investigations.  8 CONCLUSIONS  The roles of wood-decay fungal activities are therefore diverse and fundamental to forest ecosystem functioning. The fungal communities operating within the woodland resource  have been studied at a range of spatio-temporal scales. The future challenge will involve linking information derived at a range of scales in an appropriate manner. Theoretical modeling approaches have value here, the development of which can highlight the important biological features driving community dynamics and identify further hypotheses for testing. Such models may one day even have predictive value, an important asset in view of changing management land use, climate, and other environmental practices, pressures. However, future experimental studies and theo- retical models should attempt to link fungal diversity, community structure, and dynamics to function, either in terms of nutrient cycling or biological control. The fungal ecologist is faced with challenging and exciting opportunities to study what is one of mankind’s most valuable assets.

Dosoretz Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel  1  INTRODUCTION  Lignocelluloses are deﬁned as plant or wood cell walls in which celluloses and hemicelluloses are intimately associated with lignin. The role of lignin is to provide strength, serve as barrier against microbial attack, and act as water impermeable seal across the cell walls in the xylem tissue  Argyropoulos and Menachem 1997 . Lignin is a phenylpropanoid polymer synthesized from the phenolic precursors, coniferyl, synapyl, and p-coumaryl alcohols  Sarkanen and Ludwig 1971 . Free radical condensation of these precursors initiated by plant cell wall peroxidases results in the formation of a heterogeneous, amorphous, optically inactive, random, and highly branched polymer with at least 12 different types of linkages such as aryl – ether and carbon – carbon bonds connecting the aromatic nuclei. Such structural features impose unusual restrictions on its biodegradability  Hatakka 1994; Higuchi 1990; Kirk and Farrell 1987 . Most biological macromolecules such as cellulose are largely linear polymers whose subunits are linked together by a repeating bond, and thus the mechanism of polymer degradation is generally centered around the common bonds. The complexity of the lignin polymer means, however, that it is not subject to enzymatic hydrolysis and the initial attack must be oxidative, nonspeciﬁc, nonhydrolytic, and extracellular  Hatakka 1994; Higuchi 1990; Kirk and Farrell 1987 . Since lignin is particularly complex to biodegrade, the cellulose, hemicellulose, and other cell wall constituents with which it is intimately associated are  *Current afﬁliation: Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel  protected from degradation and as a result their bioavail- ability is very low. Lignin degradation, therefore, plays a central role in the earth’s carbon cycle, since most renewable carbon is either in lignin or in cellulose and hemicellulose. This chapter will focus on the biodegradation of lignin by fungi, with particular emphasis on white rots, which are the most efﬁcient degraders and the only known organisms that can completely breakdown lignin to carbon dioxide  CO2  and water  H2O   Kirk and Farrell 1987 .  2 BROWN ROT AND SOFT ROT FUNGI  Brown rot  Only a few organisms are capable of degrading the aromatic polymer lignin, the most efﬁcient of which are fungi. Three groups of fungi are capable of lignin degradation  Eriksson et al. 1990 : White rot, brown rot, and soft rot fungi  Table 1 . fungi belonging to the basidiomycetes extensively degrade cell wall carbohydrates and only modify the lignin  Eriksson et al. 1990 . Demethylation is the most obvious consequence of attack on lignin by these fungi. The brown rot fungi grows mainly in the cell lumen next to the secondary wall and cause a generalized, diffuse rot  Blanchette 2000 . The residual wood is brown and often cracks into cubical pieces when dry. Brown rot fungi have an obvious preference for coniferous substrates  gymnosperms , which are softwoods. A survey of substrate relationships reported that 19% of North American basiodiomycetes are brown rot fungi,  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

They commonly cause decay of timber in buildings  Blanchette 2000 . One of the most destructive brown rot fungi is Serpula lacrymans, which is well adapted to attacking timber in service and can spread rapidly on wood and traverse non-nutritional surfaces. Commonly, this type of decay has been referred to as dry rot. This term, apparently ﬁrst used to describe any deterioration of dead wood or wood in service is misleading because moisture must be present for the decay to occur.  rot  Soft  fungi are taxonomically classiﬁed in the subdivisions, Ascomycota and Deuteromycota. They are active in environments that are too severe for white- or brown-rot fungi, generally in wet environments, but they also decompose plant litter in soils  Blanchette 1995 . Soft rots are relatively unspecialized cellulolytic fungi in the genera Chaetomium, Ceratocystis, Phialophora, etc., that readily degrade cellulose and hemicellulose, but only modify lignin. They penetrate the secondary wall of the wood cell, forming cylindrical cavities in which the hyphae propagate. The rot is of limited extent, being closely associated with the fungal hyphae, because the cellulase enzymes do not diffuse freely through the wood.  Two distinct types of soft rot are currently recognized  Blanchette 2000 . Type I is characterized by longitudinal cavities formed within the secondary wall of wood cells and Type 2 results in erosion of the entire secondary wall. The middle lamella is not degraded in contrast to cell wall erosion by white rot fungi, but may be modiﬁed in advanced stages of decay. As decay progresses, extensive carbohydrate loss occurs and lignin concentrations increase in the residual wood.  3 WHITE ROT FUNGI  White rot fungi are the only known organisms that can completely break down lignin to CO2 and H2O  Kirk and Farrell 1987 . However, lignin cannot be degraded as a sole  source of carbon and energy by white rot fungi. Degradation of lignin enables them to gain access to cellulose and hemicellulose, which serve as their actual carbon and energy source. White rot fungi predominantly degrade wood from deciduous trees  angiosperms , containing hardwood. In a survey of 65 central European wood-decaying basidiomy- cetes: four were reported to only attack coniferous wood, 34 attacked angiosperms exclusively, and 27 attacked both  Rypacek 1977 .  The many species that cause white rots are a hetero- geneous group that may degrade greater or lesser amounts of a speciﬁc cell wall component. Some species preferentially remove lignin from wood, leaving pockets of white degraded cells that consist entirely of cellulose. This is referred to as selective deligniﬁcation  Blanchette 1995; Eriksson et al. 1990 . Other species degrade lignin and cellulose simul- taneously which is referred to as nonselective deligniﬁcation. Among the best-studied white rot fungi are Phanerochate chrysosporium and Phlebia radiata, which degrade lignin selectively, and Trametes versicolor which degrades lignin nonselectively. There are fungi such as Ganoderma applanatum and Heterobasidion annosum, which are capable of both forms of degradation  Blanchette 1995; Eriksson et al. 1990 . The ratio lignin – hemicellulose – cellulose decayed by a selective fungus can differ enormously and even different strains of the same species, e.g., of P. chrysosporium and Ceriporiopsis subvermispora, may behave differently on the same kind of wood.  White rot fungi typically colonize the cell lumen and cause cell wall erosion. Degradation is usually localized to cells colonized by fungal hyphae and substantial amounts of undecayed wood remains. Progressive erosion of the cell wall occurs when components are degraded simultaneously during nonselective deligniﬁcation and eroded zones coalesce as decay progresses forming large voids ﬁlled with mycelium. During selective deligniﬁcation a diffuse attack of lignin occurs and white pocket or white-mottled type of rot results  Blanchette 1991; 2000 .  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   Electron microscopy studies have revealed that lignin is degraded at some distance from the hyphae and is removed progressively from the lumen towards the middle lamella, which is also degraded  Blanchette 1984; Blanchette et al. 1987 . Sheaths, often composed of b-1,3-glucans, appear to be produced during early stages of wood colonization and facilitate its degradation  Blanchette et al. 1989; Nicole et al. 1995; Ruel and Joseleau 1991 . These hyphal sheaths may play an important role in transport and presentation of wood- degrading enzymes from the hyphae during the decay process, thus establishing a point of attachment to the site of degradation. The association of peroxidases to the glucan matrix is in favor of the role of the sheath as a supporting structure  Ruel and Joseleau 1991 . Furthermore, the fact that the sheath was hydrolyzed during the attack demonstrated its active role both in providing the H2O2 necessary for peroxidase activity and in providing a mode of transport for fungal enzymes to their substrates at the surface of the wood cell wall.  3.1 Screening for Lignin Degradation by White  Rot Fungi  Lignin-degrading ability is commonly evaluated by measuring 14CO2 evolution from 14C-labeled lignin preparations, such as 14C-ring-labeled dehydrogenation polymerizate  DHP . The measurement of 14CO2 evolution is the most sensitive and accurate method for testing ligninolytic activity  Eriksson et al. 1990 . The evolution of 14CO2 and the modiﬁcation of DHP has been employed for determining ligninolytic activity in many white rot fungi as well as for elucidating the role of different enzymes and other constituents in lignin degradation  Boyle et al. 1992; CostaFerreira et al. 1996; Eggert et al. 1997; Hatakka 1994; Hatakka and Uusi-Rauva 1983; Hatakka et al. 1983; Hofrichter et al. 1999; Perez and Jeffries 1992; Reid and Deschamps 1991; Sethuraman et al. 1999; Silva et al. 1996; Umezawa and Higuchi 1989; Yoshida et al. 1998 . Methods to study the degradation of polymeric lignin such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy have been developed  Davis et al. 1994; Gamble et al. 1994 , but they are not easily amenable for detailed physiological studies with microorgan- isms or biochemical studies with enzymes.  A simple and reliable screening procedure that dis- tinguishes between fungi that cause decay by selectively removing lignin and those that degrade both cellulose and lignin simultaneously has been developed involving staining of lignin with astra-blue, which stains cellulose blue only in the absence of lignin, and safranin, which stains lignin regardless of whether cellulose is present  Srebotnik and Messner 1994 .  3.2 Metabolic Studies  Unfortunately, the complexity of the lignin polymer makes it difﬁcult to study microbial ligninolysis. The lack of well- characterized model substrates that can be used to identify  ligninolytic reactions in vivo has been a long-standing difﬁculty for mechanistic studies  Crawford 1981 .  Dimeric model compounds that represent the principal substructures of lignin have been used successfully to characterize the ligninolytic systems of white rot fungi. Models of this type provided some of the ﬁrst evidence that P. chrysosporium and T. versicolor cleave the lignin isopropyl side chain between Ca and Cb  Crawford 1981 . Dimeric models played a large role in revealing that fungal lignin peroxidase  LIP  cleaves lignin between Ca and Cb, which represent 7% of the linkages in the lignin polymer  Gold et al. 1989; Hammel et al. 1993; Kirk and Farrell 1987 . Furthermore, oxidation of a b-O-4 model compound, which represents 50 – 60% of the bonds within the lignin molecule demonstrated that LIP can cleave the predominance of linkages in lignin  Glenn et al. 1983; Tien and Kirk 1983a,b . The main product is the corresponding benzaldehyde. Dimeric models have also been used to detect LIP activity in situ in fungus-colonized wood, where extraction and conventional assay of the enzyme is technically difﬁcult  Srebotnik et al. 1994 .  Degradation of a  b-O-4 - 5-5    type trimer, arylglycerol- b- dehydrodivanillyl alcohol  ether  I  by LIP showed that during its degradation by the enzyme, Ca – Cb cleavage, b-O-4 bond cleavage, and b-etheriﬁed aromatic ring  B-ring  opening products were formed  Umezawa and Higuchi 1989; Yokota et al. 1991 . The results showed that the B-ring of substrate  I , which must be sterically hindered more than those of arylglycerol-b-guaiacyl and arylglycerol-b- 2,6- dimethoxyphenyl  ethers was oxidized by LIP  Umezawa and Higuchi 1989; Yokota et al. 1991 .  0  to determine whether  Dimeric lignin model compounds have the disadvantage of low molecular weight. Unlike lignin, they can be taken up and metabolized intracellularly by microorganisms, which can the degradation make it difﬁcult products observed really reﬂect ligninolytic activity  Crawford 1981 . Ideally, lignin model compounds should be macromolecular like lignin, but to facilitate product analysis, they should have simpler structures than those of the natural polymer. For this reason dimeric lignin compounds attached to a polymer backbone such as polystyrene and polyethylene glycol have been developed  Kawai et al. 1995 .  4 LIGNINOLYTIC SYSTEM OF WHITE ROT  FUNGI  In order to degrade lignin, the white rot fungi have developed an unspeciﬁc ligninolytic system consisting of peroxidases and laccases  phenol oxidases; LAC , which degrade lignin in an oxidative process  Hatakka 1994 . The peroxidases are heme-containing enzymes and require the presence of hydrogen peroxide  H2O2  to oxidize lignin and lignin- related compounds. Three types of peroxidases have been discovered in white rot fungi: LIP, manganese peroxidase  MnP , and more recently versatile peroxidase  VP   Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

Laccases are multicopper phenol oxidases, which oxidize phenols and aromatic amines. Rather than H2O2, these enzymes utilize dioxygen  O2  as an oxidant, reducing it by four electrons to water  Call and Mucke 1997 . The enzymes involved in lignin degradation along with the roles they play are given in Table 2.  White rot fungi have been classiﬁed according to the ligninolytic enzymes they express. Whereas Hatakka suggested that they can be classiﬁed into three categories  Hatakka 1994 , Tuor et al. classiﬁed them into ﬁve categories as follows  Tuor et al. 1995 :  a  White rot fungi expressing LIP, MnP, and LAC,  b  white rot fungi simultaneously producing MnP and LAC, but not LIP,  c  white rot fungi producing LIP and either MnP or LAC,  d  white rot fungi reported to produce LIP without MnP or LAC,  e  a group which is incompletely characterized and in which neither of the oxidative enzymes have been identiﬁed.  However, the continual discovery of enzymes in different white rot fungi species means that classiﬁcations of this type are subject to ongoing changes. In particular, the recent the novel VP in Pleurotus eryngii and discovery of  Bjerkandera adusta  Camarero et al. 1999; Mester and Field 1998; Ruiz-Duenas et al. 1999; 2001 , warrants re-evaluation of the classiﬁcation scheme. Selective white rot fungi and the ligninolytic enzymes that they produce are given in Table 3.  4.1 Lignin Peroxidase  4.1.1 Properties  Lignin peroxidase is secreted as a series of glycosylated isoenzymes with pIs ranging from 3.2 to 4.0 and molecular masses ranging from 38 to 43 kDa, with each isoenzyme containing 1 mol heme per mole of protein  Farrell et al. 1989; Gold and Alic 1993; Leisola et al. 1987 . It possesses a higher redox potential and a lower pH optimum than that of any other isolated peroxidase or oxidase  Call and Mucke 1997; Hammel et al. 1986; Kersten et al. 1990 . Like other peroxidases, LIP is capable of oxidizing most phenolic compounds through the generation of phenoxy radicals. However, due to its exceptionally high redox potential and low pH optimum, it is able to oxidize nonphenolic aromatic  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   substrates, typically not oxidized by other peroxidases including the nonphenolic phenylpropanoid units of lignin  Hammel et al. 1986; Hatakka 1994; ten Have et al. 1998b; Kersten et al. 1990 . Stable cation centered radicals formed during the oxidation of nonphenolic aromatic nuclei may serve as redox mediators for LIP-catalyzed oxidations, effectively extending the substrate range. Reactions catalyzed by LIP include benzyl alcohol oxidations, side-chain cleavages, ring-opening reactions, dimethoxylations, and oxidative dechlorinations. The ability of LIP to attack such a variety of linkages suggests that it plays a key role in lignin degradation.  4.1.2 Catalytic Cycle  The catalytic cycle of LIP is similar to that of other peroxidases  Renganathan and Gold 1986; Tien et al. 1986 .  the physiological roles of which is believed to protect LIP from H2O2-dependent inactivation by reverting LIPIII to the native state. This is of particular signiﬁcance, since during oxidation of certain chemicals such as phenols, LIPIII has been shown to accumulate, indicating that they are either poor substrates for LIPII or they lack the ability to revert LIPIII to the native state  Chung and Aust 1995; Harvey and Palmer 1990 . Thus, oxidation of such chemicals is inefﬁcient at high H2O2 concentrations.  Veratryl alcohol has also been shown to act as a charge- transfer mediator in LIP catalyzed reactions  Goodwin et al. 1995; Harvey et al. 1986 . During the catalytic cycle of LIP,  , which in the VA is oxidized to VA cation radical  VA presence of suitable reducing substrate is reduced back to VA and ready for another LIP catalyzed charge-transfer reaction. The roles played by VA in the catalytic cycle of LIP are highlighted.  þ†  Reaction of native ferric enzyme [Fe-LIP; Fe3þ , P  porphyrin ] with H2O2 yields LIP-compound I  LIPI  a complex of high valent oxo-iron and porphyrin cation radical  Fe4þ ¼ O; P  . One-electron-oxidation of a reducing substrate  SH  by LIPI yields a radical cation  S†  and the II  LIPII; Fe4þ ¼ O; P . A single one-electron oxidation of a  one-electron-oxidized enzyme intermediate, LIP-compound  †þ  second substrate molecule returns the enzyme to Fe-LIP completing the catalytic cycle.  However, in the absence of suitable reducing substrate or, at high H2O2 concentrations, LIPII is further oxidized by †2 ; P , a  H2O2 to LIP-compound III  LIPIII; Fe3þ ¼ O2  species with limited catalytic activity.  Lignin peroxidase is unique from other peroxidases in that it exhibits an unusually high reactivity between LIPII and H2O2  Cai and Tien 1989; 1992; Wariishi and Gold 1990; Wariishi et al. 1990 . Since, LIPIII is inactivated rapidly in the presence of excess H2O2, if it is not rapidly reverted to the native state, the enzyme has a “suicidal” tendency.  4.1.3 Role of Veratryl Alcohol During  LIP-catalyzed Oxidation  The LIPIII has been shown to readily return to the native ferric state in the presence of H2O2 and veratryl alcohol  3,4-dimethoxybenzyl alcohol; VA   Barr and Aust 1994; Cai and Tien 1989; 1992; Wariishi and Gold 1990 . Ligninolytic cultures of P. chrysosporium normally produce VA, one of  Low molecular weight redox mediators such as VA are believed to be essential for degradation of lignin, since theoretical and electron microscopic studies have demon- strated that enzymes as large as peroxidases and LAC cannot have direct contact with lignin, since they appear to be too large for the penetration of the cell wall or the middle lamella  Call and Mucke 1997 . Pine decayed by wood rotting fungi was inﬁltrated with a concentrated culture ﬁltrate of the white fungus P. chrysosporium and labeled for LIP by rot postembedding immunoelectron microscopy. This method demonstrated that enzymatic attack on pine by LIP and presumably also other enzymes of the same size is restricted to the surface of the wood cell wall  Srebotnik and Messner 1988 .  Measurements of the stability of VA  have led to the suggestion that it would be unable to act as a diffusable oxidant without some form of stabilization  Candeias and Harvey 1995; Khindaria et al. 1996 . It was suggested that a complex acts as the redox partner, with the cation LIP – VA radical being stabilized by a protein microenvironment of acidic character  Khindaria et al. 1996 .  þ†  þ†  Nonphenolic aromatic compounds other than VA, such as 3,4-dimethoxycinnamic acid, 1,2-dimethoxybenzene, and 2-chloro-1,4-dimethoxybenzene have also been shown to be capable of mediating oxidation  Teunissen and Field 1998; Ward et al. 2002 . The mediation phenomenon appears to be driven by the difference in the oxidation potential  OP  and site-binding afﬁnity of the mediators  possessing higher OP values and higher afﬁnity  and the target substrates  possessing lower OP values and lower afﬁnity   Ward et al. 2002 .

Similar to LIP, each isozyme contains 1 mol of iron per mole of protein  Leisola et al. 1987; Paszczynski et al. 1986 . To date, ﬁve isozymes have been detected in P. chrysosporium MP-1  Kirk and Cullen 1998 .  4.2.2 Catalytic Cycle  Manganese peroxidase, like LIP has the same catalytic cycle as other peroxidases, involving a two-electron oxidation of the heme by H2O2, followed by two subsequent one-electron reductions to the native ferric enzyme. The primary reducing substrate in the MnP catalytic cycle is Mn2þ , which efﬁciently reduces compound I and compound II, generating Mn3þ , which then serves to oxidize phenols to phenoxy radicals  Hatakka 1994 .  Whereas it has been shown that cation radicals of aromatic substrates such as that of VA maintain the active form of LIP by oxidatively converting compound III to the native enzyme and preventing H2O2-dependent inactivation  Barr and Aust 1994 , Mn3þ has similarly been shown to convert MnP compound III to native enzyme  Timofeevski et al. 1998 . Additionally, Mn2þ also reactivated compound III and although this reaction was slower, it could prevent compound III accumulation when excess Mn2þ  was present.  4.2.3 Role of MnP in Lignin Degradation  In many fungi, MnP is thought to play a crucial role in the primary attack on lignin, because it generates Mn3þ , a strong diffusable oxidant able to penetrate the small “molecular pores” between cellulose microﬁbrils, which precludes the action of LIP because of steric hindrances  Flournoy et al. 1993 . Organic acids, such as oxalate  Kuan and Tien 1993 , and fumarate and malate  Hofrichter et al. 1999 , which are also produced by white rot fungi, chelate Mn3þ . These stable complexes then deliver the oxidizing power. Although MnP does not oxidize nonphenolic lignin structures during normal turnover, these structures have been shown to be slowly co-oxidized when MnP peroxidizes unsaturated fatty acids  Jensen et al. 1996; Kapich et al. 1999a . Bao et al. described the oxidation of a nonphenolic lignin model by a lipid peroxidation system that consisted of P. chrysosporium MnP, Mn2þ , and unsaturated fatty acid esters  Bao et al. 1994 . Substrate oxidation occurred via benzylic hydrogen abstrac- tion and it was suggested that this process might enable the white rot fungi to accomplish the initial deligniﬁcation of wood. The importance of Mn2þ and the involvement of lipid peroxidation in depolymerization and mineralization of 14C-labeled, polyethylene glycol linked, b-O-4 lignin model compound by C. subvermispora in wood block cultures and  deﬁned medium has been demonstrated  Jensen et al. 1996 . Lipid peroxidation has been suggested as the mechanism involved in the oxidation of the nonphenolic lignin structures by white rot fungi that do not produce LIP.  4.3 Versatile Peroxidase  A heme peroxidase different from other microbial, plant, and animal peroxidases, termed VP has recently been discovered in Pleurotus and Bjerkandera species  Camarero et al. 1999; Mester and Field 1998; Ruiz-Duenas et al. 1999; 2001 . The VP is characterized by catalytic properties of MnP and LIP. The enzyme exhibits high afﬁnity for Mn2þ , hydroquinones, and dyes, and also oxidizes VA, dimethoxybenzene, and lignin dimers  Ruiz-Duenas et al. 2001 . Molecular models show a Mn2þ -binding site formed by three acidic residues near the heme internal propionate accounting for the ability of VP to oxidize Mn2þ  Ruiz-Duenas et al. 1999 . Concerning aromatic substrate oxidation, VP shows a putative long-range electron transfer pathway from an exposed trytophan to heme, similar to that postulated in LIP  Ruiz-Duenas et al. 2001 . Mutagenesis and chemical modiﬁcation of this tryptophan and the acidic residues forming the Mn2þ -binding site conﬁrmed their role in catalysis.  4.4 Laccase  4.4.1 Properties  Laccases are multicopper phenol oxidases that oxidize phenols and aromatic amines. Rather than H2O2, these enzymes utilize O2 as an oxidant, reducing it by four electrons to H2O  Call and Mucke 1997 . LACs are generally larger than peroxidases, having molecular weights of approximately 60 kDa and above  Call and Mucke 1997 . As with other extracellular enzymes, LACs are glycosylated.  4.4.2 Role of LAC in Lignin Degradation  Laccase oxidizes phenolic lignin model compounds directly  Kawai et al. 1988 . Although it is a phenoloxidase and its redox potential is too low to directly oxidize the nonphenolic components of lignin, it has been shown to degrade lignin efﬁciently in the white rot Pycnoporus cinnabarinus, which does not produce MnP or LIP  Eggert et al. 1997 . To overcome the redox potential barrier, P. cinnabarinus produces a metabolite, 3-hydroxyanthranilate that can mediate the oxidation of nonphenolic substrates by LAC  Eggert et al. 1996 . It is believed that natural mediators, such as 3-hydroxyanthranillic acid in the white rot P. cinnabarinus act as diffusable lignin-oxidizing agents. In the presence of the mediators 3-hydroxyanthranillic acid, hydroxybenzotria- -azinobis 3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate  zole, or 2,2  ABTS , LAC has been shown to oxidize nonphenolic lignin, VA, and PAH  Bourbonnais et al. 1995; Collins et al. 1996; Eggert et al. 1996; Majcherczyk et al. 1998; 1999 .  0  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   4.5 H2O2 Generating Enzymes  In addition to the enzymes mentioned earlier, the ligninolytic includes extracellular H2O2 system of white rot fungi generating enzymes, essential for peroxidase activity. To date, a number of oxidase enzymes have been shown to lead to the production of H2O2, including glyoxal oxidase  GLOX , glucose 1-oxidase, methanol oxidase, and aryl-alcohol oxidase  AO   Zhao and Janse 1996 . White rot fungi that lack H2O2 generating oxidases may rely on the oxidation of physiological organic acids such as oxalate and glyoxalate, which indirectly results in H2O2 production  Urzua et al. 1995 .  4.6 Cellobiose Dehydrogenase  , Cu2þ  Cellobiose dehydrogenase  CDH  is an extracellular enzyme produced by many white rot fungi  Henriksson et al. 2000 . It oxidizes soluble cellodextrins, mannodextrins, and lactose efﬁciently to their corresponding lactones by a ping-pong mechanism using a wide spectrum of electron acceptors including quinones, phenoxy radicals, Fe3þ , and triodide ion. The function of CDH is not obvious, but P. chrysosporium produces relatively high levels of the enzyme, approximately 0.5% of the secreted protein on a mass basis, suggesting it plays an important role. Many functions have been suggested for CDH, some of which are related to cellulose degradation, but in the current context only those that are relevant to lignin biodegradation will be discussed. It has been suggested that CDH reduces aromatic radicals formed by ligninolytic enzymes, thereby preventing their repolymerization and supporting lignin degradation  Ander et al. 1990; Temp and Eggert 1999 . In addition, it has  been shown that CDH can generate hydroxyl radicals  OH†   1994 . The modiﬁcation of lignin by OH† radicals produced  by CDH may result in hydroxylation of nonphenolic structures to phenolic ones, facilitating MnP and LAC action and suggesting that the enzymes may form a pathway in lignin biodegradation  Hilden et al. 2000 . It has also been suggested that CDH may support MnP by reducing precipitated MnO2, which is common in rotten wood to Mn2þ . It might also aid MnP by producing cellobionic acid, which should complex Mn3þ   Roy et al. 1994 .  or Mn3þ  4.7 Reactive Oxygen Species  Reactive oxygen species and the suggested roles that they play in lignin degradation are given in Table 4.  The production of OH† radicals by white rot fungi is well Tanaka et al. 1999a,b . OH† radicals are very reactive and  documented  Barr et al. 1992; Kutsuki and Gold 1982;  can attack the subunits of lignin by both abstracting aliphatic Ca-hydrogens and by adding to aromatic rings  Hammel et al.  2002 . Typical reactions of OH† radical with the major  arylglycerol-b-aryl ether structure of lignin can result in demethoxylation, b-O-4 cleavage, hydroxylation, or Ca-oxidation  Hammel et al. 2002 . The oxidation of lignin  by OH† radicals, therefore, results in diverse reactions, some remains unclear whether any wood decay fungus uses OH†  of which are expected to degrade the polymer. However, it  radical to oxidize lignin. Hydroxylation of both phenolic and nonphenolic lignin resulting in new phenolic substructures on the lignin polymer may make it susceptible to attack by LAC or MnP  Hilden et al. 2000; Tanaka et al. 1999a .  If white rot fungi produce OH† radicals, then it is also necessary to consider the effects that peroxyl  ROO†  and hydroperoxyl  HOO†  radicals have on lignin, since both of these ROS are expected as secondary radicals when OH†  in a fenton type reaction, which can modify cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin  Henriksson et al. 1995; Wood  radicals oxidize wood polymers  Hammel et al. 2002 . fungi peroxidizes Manganese peroxidase of white rot  Table 4 Reactive oxygen species and their role in lignin degradation by white rot fungi  Reactive oxygen species  Hydroxyl  radicals  OH†   Peroxyl radicals   ROO†   Superoxide radicals  O2  †2     Role in lignin degradation  References  Demethoxylation, b-O-4 cleavage, hydroxylation, or Ca-oxidation of nonphenolic structures; hydroxylation of nonphenolic lignin results in the formation of phenolic structures, making it susceptible to attack by MnP and LAC Oxidation of nonphenolic lignin.

ROO†  unsaturated fatty acids, which results in the formation of ROS that radical-generating systems including MnP in the presence of unsaturated fatty acids were shown to oxidize a nonphenolic b-O-4-linked lignin model dimer to products indicative of hydrogen abstraction  Kapich et al. 1999b . Since, white rot fungi do produce extracellular lipids  Enoki et al. 1999 , the  formation of ROO† radicals by an MnP dependent does seem reasonable. The involvement of ROO† radicals in  mechanism and their involvement  in lignin degradation 0  known ROO† radical reductant Mn2þ  -dimethoxyphenyl  the chemical consumption of 1- 3 propene  DMPP  by LIP was conﬁrmed by using the well-  ten Have et al. 2000 . This metal ion severely inhibited the DMPP consumption rate under air, but did not affect the lower enzymatic DMPP consumption rate under N2. In the absence of O2, the Ca – Cb cleavage of DMPA to veratryl aldehyde was strongly inhibited and side-chain coupling products  dimers  were formed instead. As a whole, these results suggest that during LIP-catalyzed oxidation of aromatic substrates, O2 is responsible for the formation of reactive ROO† intermedi-  ,4  0  ates, which can directly react with other substrate molecules and thereby accelerate consumption rates and also prevents coupling reactions by lowering the pool of carbon-centered radicals accumulating during LIP catalysis.  In contrast to OH† and ROO†, superoxide anion radicals †2 †2   are unable to oxidize lignin units. However, O2  O2 produced by white rot fungi can participate in the production of H2O2 via both dismutation ð2O þ ¼ H2O2 þ O2Þ †2 oxidation with concomitant production of Mn3þ and Mn2þ 2 þ ¼ H2O2 þ Mn3þÞ  Archibald and Fri- ðO †2 dovich 1982 .

Subsequent dismutation of O2 †2  evolves from the cleavage of oxalate via oxalate decarboxylase  ten Have and Teunissen 2001 . Oxalate is produced as a major aliphatic acid by white rot fungi  Makela et al. 2002 . Its decomposition results in the †2  , formation of CO2 and the formate anion radical  CO2 †2 which is further oxidized by O2 to give CO2 and O2 or resulting in the formation of H2O2 indicates that oxalate may serve as a passive sink for production of the latter. Both LIP and MnP are also capable of decomposing oxalate in the presence of VA and Mn2þ , respectively  Akamatsu et al. 1990; Shimada et al. 1994  and indeed other organic acids  Hofrichter et al. 1998; Urzua et al. 1998 . These reactions account for the observed oxidation of phenol red and kojic acid by MnP in the presence of Mn2þ , without exogenous addition of H2O2  Kuan and Tien 1993; Urzua et al. 1995 . The reduction of þ† þ or Mn3þ by oxalate suggests that as long as oxalate VA coexists with LIP and MnP, lignin degradation. Indeed, oxalate has been shown to strongly  it would inhibit  †2  reduce the rate of lignin mineralization in ligninolytic cultures of white rot fungi  Akamatsu et al. 1990; Ma et al. 1992; Shimada et al. 1994 .  5 PHYSIOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR LIGNIN DEGRADATION BY WHITE ROT FUNGI  Lignin is unable to serve as the sole carbon and energy source for white rot fungi. In order for lignin degradation to proceed, white rot fungi require an additional more readily utilizable source of carbon  Ander and Eriksson 1975; Kirk et al. 1976 . It has been hypothesized that the normal mode for white rot fungi to degrade wood is by simultaneous attack of polysaccharides and lignin  Boominathan and Reddy 1992 . Degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose provides glucose for the fungus and when the ﬂow of sugar ceases, the fungus starves and thereby goes from primary to secondary metabolism.  White rot  the onset of  fungi degrade lignin at  the secondary growth phase, when utilizable nutrients are depleted and primary fungal growth ceases  Bonnarme et al. 1991 . However, it should be considered that the concepts of primary and secondary metabolism might be an over- simpliﬁcation regarding lignin degradation during natural conditions where fungal growth and lignin degradation can occur at the same time. Carbon, nitrogen, and manganese are all critical nutritional variables in triggering secondary metabolism and the production of ligninolytic enzymes including LIP and MnP by P. chrysosporium and other white rot fungi  Bonnarme et al. 1991 . Considering that the nitrogen content of wood is very low  C N 350-500 1   Cowling and Merrill 1966 , it is no surprise that nitrogen plays an important role in growth and metabolism  Buswell and Odier 1987; Kirk and Farrell 1987 . In P. chrysosporium, limitation of nitrogen, carbon, or sulfur  Jeffries et al. 1981  can trigger secondary metabolism and lignin degradation. Fungal degradation of lignin in wheat straw was affected by the amount of nitrogen  NH4NO3 , which appears to repress lignin degradation, by most fungi on this substrate  Zadrazil and Brunnert 1980 . However, nutrient nitrogen only had a moderate inﬂuence on lignin mineralization by T. versicolor and almost no inﬂuence on P. ostreatus and Lentinus edodes  Leatham and Kirk 1983 . In general, nitrogen repression of lignin degradation in white rot fungi is common but it is not always a rule.  The ligninolytic activity in P. chrysosporium is also triggered in cultures where carbon becomes limiting. The activity appears when the carbon source is depleted, and this activity is associated with a decrease of mycelial dry weight. The amount of lignin degraded depends on the amount of carbohydrate provided, which in turn determines the amount of mycelium produced during primary growth  Jeffries et al. 1981 .

The lignocellulose complex in straw and other plant residues is degraded very slowly by ruminants, because of the physical and chemical barrier imposed by lignin polymers, preventing free access of hydrolytic enzymes, such as cellulases and hemicellulases to their substrates. Normally, the rate of decay of plant debris is proportional to its lignin content. Deligniﬁcation of straw by white rot fungi seems to be the most promising way of improving its digestibility  Kamra and Zadrazil 1986; Streeter et al. 1982; Zadrazil and Reinger 1988 . The role of fungi in agricultural waste conversion by different fungi species has been recently reviewed  Cohen and Hadar 2001 .  6.2 Biopulping  The objective of pulping is to extract cellulose ﬁbers from plant material, generally hard or soft wood trees. Mechanical and chemical pulping are usually employed for this process. However, a biological approach involving white rot fungi could replace environmentally unfriendly chemicals  e.g., chlorine  save on mechanical pulping energy costs and improve the quality of pulp and the properties of paper  Breen and Singleton 1999 . The ligninolytic enzymes of white rot fungi selectively remove or alter lignin and allow cellulose ﬁbers to be obtained. Recent data suggest that biopulping has the potential to be an environmentally and economically feasible alternative to current pulping methods  Akhtar et al. 2000; Scott et al. 1998 .  6.3 Mushroom Production  Several of the white rot fungi that can utilize lignocellulose are edible mushrooms. They have been successfully cultivated at a commercial level worldwide using ligno- cellulosic wastes as the main substrate  Wood and Smith 1987 . Agaricus bisporus, known as the “button mushroom,” L. edodes known as “Shiitake,” and P. ostreatus, known as the “oyster mushroom” are just this agricultural – biotechnological crop. Bioconversion of ligno- cellulosic residues through mushroom cultivation also offers the potential for converting these residues into protein-rich palatable food, reducing the environmental impact of the wastes.  three examples of  recycling the carbon of  Lignin degradation plays a central role in the earth’s carbon cycle, since it hinders decomposition of the most renewable carbon sources, cellulose and hemicellulose. White rot fungi able to cause complete wood decay are the most efﬁcient lignin degraders known and they are perhaps nature’s major agents for ligniﬁed tissues. Considerable research has been devoted to understanding the chemistry, biochemistry, and genetics underlying the degradation of lignin by these fungi. Many enzymes and several small molecules including reactive oxygen species and organic acids have been described as playing a role in lignin degradation by white rot fungi in nature. However, a major breakthrough is still required to understand the relative contribution of the individual components of the ligninolytic system and the synergism that exists between them. Overcoming the difﬁculties associated with studying the degradation of such a complex polymer could enable this. Obviously, progress in these directions would have far reaching implications and could be of considerable aid in developing the many potential biotechnological applications that have been proposed for the ligninolytic system of white rot fungi.

Dilorio Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, Massachusetts, USA  1  INTRODUCTION  For well over a century, metal-contaminated industrial wastewaters have been released into the environment by industry, agriculture, sewage treatment, and mining opera- tions worldwide. Since the WWII era, the nuclear fuel cycle has contributed an additional and unique waste burden of uranium and other radioactive metals. Metal ions, unlike most organic chemicals, can persist in the environment indeﬁnitely, posing threats to organisms which are exposed to them  Volesky and Holan 1995 . Governmental control of such discharges has only been energetically regulated in the past two or three decades. Many toxic inorganic chemicals have, over time, accumulated in soils, sediments, and impound- ments throughout the world. Metal-bearing liquid wastes may be of known and predictable composition if generated by a single industry, e.g., electroplating wastewaters, or in other cases may be a heterogeneous mix of many dissolved metal ions and organic compounds at various pH values and ionic strengths, with colloidal and particulate matter present as well. Governments are now regulating this problem by mandating preventative actions and forcing industries and laboratories and other waste generators to intercept toxic metals before they are discharged. Most heavy metal containing wastewaters are treated using remediation technologies that have been borrowed primarily from the unit operations of the chemical industry which rely on a mixture of physical and chemical processes  Table 1  to render the metal ion contaminants less toxic or more easily handled. Unfortunately the chemical form of the converted metal  e.g., a gelatinous precipitate  is itself often in need of careful and expensive disposal, and conventional treatment becomes less efﬁcient and more expensive when metal ion  *Current afﬁliation: Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA  concentrations fall into the 1 – 10 mg l range. Table 2 provides a listing of discharge limits of metal ﬁnishing wastewaters in the United States, and as such represents goals that must be met by any new technology or existing technologies. Discharge limits for municipal wastewater treatment plants in the United States are much stricter than those listed in Table 2. Inﬂuent levels of Cu2þ in wastewaters arriving at municipal sewage treatment plants range from 100 to 250 mg l, but efﬂuent levels of 6 – 25 mg l are expected to be attained under new U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guidelines  Amer 1998 . Regulations governing aqueous metal discharges in the United Kingdom have been reviewed by Forster and Wase  1997  who also discussed the toxic biological effects of several of the important heavy metals. A genuine need now exists for new and certainly more cost- effective technologies to replace or supplement the physico- chemical approaches currently in use for removing metal contamination at existing sites and for preventing future contamination of natural waters by heavy metals. There is hope that biotechnology may provide new insights to solving these problems  Crusberg et al. 1994; 1996; Gretsky 1994 . Biotechnology has been successfully exploited as a remedy for many types of discharges of organic wastes and for in situ bioremediation of sediments at contaminated sites and in fact is the preferred remedy for many instances  Alexander 1999 . There is hope that some of the physiological processes and genetic adaptations that protect organisms against toxic metals and other inorganic contaminants can be identiﬁed and exploited for the removal and recovery of those metals from aqueous waste streams  Crusberg et al. 1991; 1996; Hartley et al. 1997; Nies 1999; Ow 1996; 1997 . Systems which use renewable biomass to extract metal ions from solutions may be an environmentally friendly alternative to physico-chemical  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

This discussion will center on heterotrophic microorganisms, primarily yeast and fungi as possible candidates for development as heavy metal biosorbents or “biotraps.” Biotraps in this review are deﬁned as any organism  living or nonliving  or component of an organism, which can alter the form of, or bind with a toxic metal or metal ion allowing its removal and recovery from a waste stream, or rendering it harmless.  2 POTENTIAL OF FUNGAL  BIOTECHNOLOGY  It has been recognized for decades that many micro- organisms have a physiology, which allows them to act on  Table 2 Pretreatment standards based upon Best Practical Control Technology  BPT  for existing sources of metal ﬁnishing wastewaters.

In fact, genetic adaptation to survival of microorganisms in heavy metal-rich environments is not at all unusual in nature  Nies 1999; Ow 1996 .  One aim of biotechnology is to put that special physiology to use and produce a commercial product  cell or cell component  for remediating heavy metal contamination. Biological materials that can accomplish this mission may be therefore termed biotraps and can be grouped into three major categories based on function:  a. Biosorption or the process by which individual cells  or cell components bind or take up metals a. Adsorption of ions onto a surface, including ion  exchange and complexing with ligands, and  b. Uptake into the cell and sequestration by  cytoplasmic components,  b. Transformation by oxidation reduction into a less  toxic or volatile form, and  c. Precipitation by forming insoluble salts, or by a  combination of these processes.  This review discusses general heavy metal bioremediation processes rather than have to deal with each group of organisms individually.  3 FUNGAL-MEDIATED HEAVY METAL  REMOVAL FROM AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS  3.1 Biosorption  Biosorption is a term that describes the broad range of processes by which biomass removes metals  and other substances  from solution, yet it can also be used in a stricter sense to describe uptake by dead  detritus  or living biomass by purely physico-chemical processes such as adsorption or ion exchange  White et al. 1995 . Metabolic processes inherent in living biomass may contribute to the uptake mechanism. Ideally a biosorbent has the ability to be recycled and the sorbed metal ions recovered for reuse or safer disposal. Choice of a suitable biotrap is at times made easier if certain genetic and biochemical characteristics of an organism are known. That fungi and yeast can serve as biotraps for heavy metals has been the subject of a great deal of research as evidenced by several prior reviews on the subject  Blackwell et al. 1995; Kapoor and Viraraghavan 1995; 1997 .  Predicting the effectiveness of a biotrap requires that some of its chemical composition be understood. For example, chitin and chitosan are well known metal-ion adsorbers due to the presence of both carboxyl and amine groups which make up these biopolymers  Ashkenazy et al. 1997; Cuero 1996; Fourest and Roux 1992; Juang et al. 1999 . In fungi, the cell walls present a multilamillar architecture where up to 90% of the dry weight consists of amino- or nonamino- polysaccharides  Farkas 1980 . The fungal cell wall is in essence a two-phase system consisting of a ﬁbrous  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   chitin-based skeletal framework embedded within an amorphous polysaccharide matrix  Grifﬁn 1994 . Yeast and higher fungi such as the deuteromycetes Trichoderma viride have cell walls composed primarily of chitin and glucan polymers while the lower fungi such as Rhizopus arrhizus have cell walls of chitosan and chitin  Morley and Gadd 1995 . Although chitosan does bind metal ions, the more highly polymerized and cross linked chitin performs better as a metal biotrap. However, Crusberg et al.  1994  reported that chitin, derived from a marine invertebrate source, was capable at best of binding 14.7 mg Cu2þ  g biotrap at pH 4.0, with a binding constant of 27 mM, and concluded that this system was not likely to be developed commercially. There were better alternatives.  There is virtually no standardization in the literature for reporting details of metal-binding experiments with biotraps. Concentrations of metal ions are reported in several variations of mass per unit volume  mg l, parts per million or ppm, and mg l, parts per billion or ppb , as well as in moles per unit volume, millimolar  mmol l  and micromolar  mml l . For example, copper ion  Cu2þ   at 63 mg l  ppm  may also be expressed as 1 mM but a uranium concentration of 1 mM would be almost four times larger in terms of mass per unit volume, at 238 mg l. In fact, Cu2þ is often chosen as the model heavy metal in initial studies on a potential biosorbent because there are many quite sensitive analytical techniques available for its analysis. Most regulatory agencies mandate permissible metal ion concentrations in wastewater dis- charges in terms of mass per unit volume, e.g., ppm or ppb  parts per billion or mg l . Other issues that should be properly addressed by investigators, but are often omitted in scientiﬁc reports, are effects of pH of an experiment on metal ion solubility, and ionic strength effects on equilibrium constants. For example, Cu2þ at 10 mg l precipitates  as Cu OH 2  when the pH rises above 6.3, and precipitates at 1 mg l when the pH rises above 6.8, based on a Ksp of 5 £ 10220  13*, 3*, 24 .  Ionic strength may affect rate constants which comprise an equilibrium constant according to Debey – Huckle theory. Even buffers used to maintain pH during uptake binding studies should be chosen to minimize their chelating potential for the metal ions under consideration.  3.2 Heavy Metal Biosorption  Fungi and yeasts  Puranik et al. 1995; Sag and Kutsal 1996; Volesky and May-Phillips 1995; Zhao and Duncan 1998  have in the past received the most attention in connection with metal biosorption systems, particularly because plentiful amounts of fungal biomass are generated as by-products of several types of industrial alcohol and antibiotic fermenta- tions  Omar et al. 1996; Sag et al. 2000; Volesky and Holan 1995 . One such system consisting of Aspergillus niger waste from citric acid production was shown to remove zinc  as dust , magnetite, and metal sulﬁdes from wastewater  Singleton et al. 1990; Wainwright et al. 1990 . This process was shown to be independent of metabolism but was favored  by cell growth, with the particles eventually becoming entrapped within the matrix of the fungal hyphae. Al-Asheh and Duvnjak  1992  demonstrated that living mycelia of Aspergillus carbonarius were able to adsorb copper and chromium and noted that an increase in uptake correlated with an increase in pH. Sag et al.  1999  recently reported the simultaneous adsorption of chromate and divalent copper ions by living R. arrhizus in packed columns operated in continuous mode. Other fungal adsorbents were successfully demonstrated by Suhasini et al.  1999  to remove nickel ion from aqueous solutions, achieving uptake capacities of 214 mg Ni2þ   g dry wt fungus.  Yeast similarly have proven to be effective research models for metal sorption studies. The abundant brewery and bakery yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been the object of numerous biosorption studies. Wilhelmi and Duncan  1995  showed that immobilized cells of this yeast had the capability to adsorb Cu, Co, Cd, Ni, Zn, and Cr with an uptake averaging around 40 mmol g in continuous ﬂow packed bed columns through 8 repeated adsorption – desorption cycles. Optimum chromate removal from electroplating efﬂuents has been recently demonstrated in ﬁxed-bed columns at pH 2.5 using formaldehyde cross-linked S. cerevisiae  Zhao and Duncan 1998 . Lead was found to adsorb at pH 5.5, to a nonliving cell mass of Saccharomyces uvarum, up to a maximum of 48.9 mg Pb g dry wt biotrap. Given that carboxyl and amine groups served as the ligand to which the metal bound, it was assumed that chitin was the most likely provider of these groups  Ashkenazy et al. 1997 .  Several authors now propose that biosorption processes utilizing whole cell biomass can realistically be considered as replacement technologies for existing metal-removal pro- cesses, or even as an effective polishing unit in place of existing treatment  Kapoor and Viraraghavan 1995; Volesky and Holan 1995 . One recent promising report noted that dried powdered mycelium of Fusarium ﬂocciferum can take up 19.2 mg Cd and 5.2 mg Ni, and between 4 and 6 for Cu, for each 100 mg of fungus  Delgado et al. 1998 . Rather severe treatment regimens also may produce a biomass more capable of metal ion uptake. For example Brady et al.  1994  showed treatment of yeast biomass increased that hot alkali accumulation of divalent cation adsorption but limited success in removing chromate was reported. Formaldehyde treatment also was found to render baker’s yeast more efﬁcient in binding Cr VI   Zhao and Duncan 1998  but only a disappointing 6.3 mg Cr g treated biomass was achieved. However Kapoor et al.  1999  recently reported that A. niger biomass was more effective than biomass treated by boiling in 0.1 N NaOH for the removal of Ni by biosorption. A number of questions regarding the behavior of dead vs. living biomass in the biosorption process was recently examined by Yetis et al.  2000  in a study of Pb II  uptake by dead, resting and living Phanerochaete chrysosporium mycelia. Table 3 provides a comprehensive listing of a wide variety of biotraps  including some of bacterial origin as a comparison  capable of speciﬁcally sorbing copper from aqueous solutions.

All Rights Reserved.   3.3 Extracellular Precipitation of Metals  Exceeding a solubility product leads to precipitation of an insoluble salt of the reacting species. Sulﬁde anion  S22   and oxalate anion ðC2O22  Þ are produced by some species of  4  micro-organisms and these anions can form very insoluble salts with heavy metal ions which exhibit very small solubility products as noted by Veglio and Beolchini  1997 . Copper phosphate precipitation occurring within the matrix of mycelia of the fungus Penicillium ochro-chloron after 4 days of incubation in shake ﬂask cultures at pH 4, was demonstrated using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray microanalysis  Crusberg et al. 1994 . Wrinkled 40 – 50 mm dia. spheres of insoluble copper phosphate, inferred from EDX analysis, are trapped within the mycelia of the fungus grown for 4 days in aerated cultures in the presence of 100 mg l Cu2þ . Penicilllium and Aspergillus have been shown to produce extracellular acid phosphatases which correlate with copper removal from solution  Haas et al. 1991; Tsekova et al. 2002 . It is likely that the extracellular phosphatases are localized in the periplasmic space, sandwished between the membrane and cell wall materials. There they can act on extracellular organophosphates, hydrolyzing the phosphate and organic moieties for uptake via specialized transport systems. As a means of detoxiﬁcation, the free phosphate anions can then react with and precipitate heavy metal ions as insoluble heavy metal phosphates before those ions enter the cell. A. niger has also been recently shown to immobilize metals as insoluble oxalate salts  Cunningham and Kuiack 1992; Sayer and Gadd 1997 . In fact, oxalate is a common secondary metabolite of Penicillium spp.  Sayer and Gadd 1997  and is known to precipitate calcium oxalate under natural conditions in litter  Tait et al. 1999 . Lead oxalate precipitation between pH 4 and 5 has also been demonstrated as a means of detoxiﬁction using living A. niger biomass  Sayer et al. 1999 . Fungi therefore possess two mechanisms to protect themselves against extracellular heavy metals involving the precipitation of heavy metals as insoluble salts. Recently, Mukherjee et al. ions by  2001  Verticillum sp.

However some biomolecules function speciﬁcally to bind metals and are even genetically induced by their presence  Macaskie and Dean 1990 . In S. cerevisiae the low molecular weight cysteine-rich polypeptide metalothionein  þ2 and Zn  þ2 as well as Zn binds Cu through detoxiﬁcation of metal natural environment  Turner and Robinson 1995 .  þ2 and provides resistance ions encountered in the  3.5 The Special Case for Uranium  A serious effort has gone into ﬁnding biological means to reduce forms of more soluble uranium [U VI ] compounds from aqueous waste streams, which appear at various stages of the nuclear fuel cycle. By exploiting the physiology of several different groups of microorganisms it has been shown that U VI  can be adsorbed to microbial surfaces or biochemically converted to the very insoluble reduced [U IV ] oxidation state, usually the uranite form  UO2 . Several organisms have been reported to carry out reduction of U VI  to U IV  anaerobically. A nonviable preparation of a thermotolerant ethanol producing strain of Kluyveromyces marxianus was found to rapidly take up uranium VI  with an efﬁciency of up to 150 mg U g dry wt biomass, but with lower binding at lower pH values  Bustard and McHale 1997; Bustard et al. 1997 . Likewise, a cross-linked immobilized residual biomass from distillery spent wash was found capable of sorbing over 200 mg U g dry wt biomass  Bustard and McHale 1997 . A proprietary method using processed granules of the fungus R. arrhizus proved successful for uranium ion immobilization  Brierley and Brierely 1993  at 50 mg U g biomass dry weight, in batch uptake studies. Complete uranium removal was demonstrated for dilute uranium ore bioleaching solutions  , 300 mg l  with eluate concentrations after desorption approaching 5000 mgU l.  3.6 COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS  Most living cell systems exploited to date have been used for decontamination of efﬂuents containing metals at concentrations below toxic concentrations  Kapoor and Viraraghavan 1995; White et al. 1995 . Some of those technologies employ a consortium of undeﬁned micro- organisms as well as higher plants. The “Meander System” used at the Homestake lead mine  MO, USA  passes efﬂuents containing Pb, Cu, Zn, Ni, Fe, and Cd ions through various ditches or channels containing autotrophic cyanobacteria, algae, and higher plants. Metal ion removal is achieved with an efﬁciency greater than 99%  Erlich and Brierley 1990; Jennet and Wixson 1983 . These complex systems likely utilize precipitation and entrapment of particulates, in addition to biosorption and uptake into cells and plant tissues, in the removal process and concentrate the metals in the sediment in forms which greatly reduce environmental mobility and bioavailability  Brierley and Brierely 1993 . In order to render sparse minerals in low grade ores soluble, those involved in biohydrometallurgy have exploited other micro-organisms to facilitate metal recovery  Brombacher et al. 1997  with the aim of mobilizing precious metals, Au, Ag, and sometimes Pt, but Ga, Ge. Patents  described in the  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   above references  outlining various processes employ reactor technology and the most simple heap-leach or in situ operations to strip metals from their ores. Bioleaching of metals from ores has successfully employed bacteria such as Thiobacilli, Sulfobacilli, and Sulfolobus, as well as consortia of organisms and some unidentiﬁed indigent species. The same practices, which are in use in the mining industry to liberate metals from ores perhaps have applications in the remediation of soils contaminated with those same metals by mobilization, followed by biosorption. Commercial processes using biosorbents for metal ion removal from aqueous waste streams are still in their infancy.  4 BIOREACTOR DESIGN  Bench-scale shake ﬂask experiments rarely mimic the complexities encountered in unit operations where large volumes and short reaction times must be employed to ensure the economy of scale. Unit operations are preferred in the chemical industry since the process can usually be subject to computational modeling and thereby more predictable. Also, many industrial wastewaters contain several heavy metal contaminants and therefore competitive adsorption to sites on the surface of fungi has to be accounted for as described in a recent study involving Penicillium chrysogenum and Streptoverticillium cinnamoneum by Puranik and Paknikar  1999 . Biomass used in a reactor has to be either inexpensive and disposable or preferably in any case reusable after adsorbed metal ions are eluted. Yeast and fungi present somewhat difﬁcult materials for carrying out column separation studies as the biomass often forms an impervious mat. However, the use of polyurethane foams as supports for biomass may help to overcome this problem  Dias et al. 2002; Tsekova and Ilieva 2001 . Reaction times of biomass with metals to achieve sorption of metal ions must be short, yet many reports in the literature allow incubations to run for days to achieve suitable and reportable metal ion uptake. A typical experiment requires a 4-day incubation to prepare sufﬁcient mycelia of A. niger for study and then another 24 hr for adsorption in shake ﬂask following addition of metal ion  Price et al. 2001 . However there are report of more rapid equilibration requiring from 10 to 30 min of contact  Puranik and Paknikar 1999 . Immobilizing A. niger biomass within a polyurethane foam within an adsorption column increased copper uptake threefold compared with free mycelia studied in batch adsorption experiments  Tsekova and Ilieva 2001 . Computational methods applied to unit operations permit the economy of a process to be predicted  Al-Asheh and Duvnjak 1992; Sag et al. 2001; Schiewer and Wong 1999 . However, commercial scale bioreactors must address the problem of how a particular biotrap can render the inﬂuent metal concentration less harmful as the efﬂuent is discharged. If it is to succeed, new biotrap technology must compete economi- cally with those already at hand in the chemical industry. Sophisticated approaches have been reported for mathe- matical modeling of metal-biotrap sorption and precipitation   Figueira et al. 1997; Schiewer and Volesky 1996; Veglio and Beolchini 1997 . A mathematical Langmuir model has was recently developed for the prediction and performance of the simultaneous biosorption of Cr VI and Fe III  by R. arrhizus in a semi-batch reactor. Likewise Sag et al.  2000  have recently reported the theoretical approach to and use of a continuous-ﬂow stirred tank reactor for removing lead, nickel and copper from aqueous solution by nonliving R. arrhizus biomass.  5 LIMITATIONS AND POTENTIAL  The economic threshold for commercial selection of a biological process to replace a physico-chemical process for heavy metal removal from a waste stream as assessed by Macaskie  1991  is that a metal-loading capacity greater than 15% of the biomass dry wt must be demonstrated. Before the selection of any technology, it is imperative to note the hierarchy of hazardous waste management options: reduce; reuse; recycle.  The option of last resort is to treat and dispose of the waste in safe landﬁlls, while minimizing the resultant volume, since disposal sites are few and space is precious not to mention expensive. A given bioremediation technology should be able to perform on a large scale in order for it to be commercially viable. The organism or biomaterial selected to accomplish the goal of removing or altering a heavy metal or metal ion rendering it less toxic must be very efﬁcient in performing its intended function. The literature is rich with reports of studies attesting to the “potential” of a particular biomass or biomaterial to carry out bioremediation of metal- contaminated waste streams, but few have actually ventured beyond the laboratory bench scale. What is clear is the apparent dearth of genetic engineering reports in the literature. Classical genetic selection methods have proven useful, for e.g., for isolating a strain of S. cerevisiae out of 240 tested, capable of uptake of 3.2 mg chromium  Cr VI   per g dry wt of yeast cells  Liu et al. 2001 . Genes which carry out certain functions in micro-organisms that provide them with resistance to heavy metals may be exploited for the development of new bioremediation technologies. Hunts for metal-resistant and metal ion-binding microorganisms appear to be very successful, but the investigators nearly always neglect to pursue the genetics behind their discovery. Silver recently reviewed the genetics of metal resistance by bacteria and noted several speciﬁc genes involved in metal uptake  Silver 1998 . Many of these genes are located on plasmids and although not directly relevant to fungi and yeast they may have some characteristics in common with Eukaryotes. Ow  1996  has suggested that that employing Schizosaccharomyces pombe as a model system, and understanding of yeast metal tolerance genes may become clearer. Newly developed technologies can also be used to immobilize or encapsulate an isolated biotrap into gels where it can function in an in vitro manner if desirable. For example, gel-immobilized metal-binding proteins could then trap metal  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

Recovery of heavy metals from contaminated soils and sediments by in situ bioremediation, however, remains elusive. To mobilize metals in those environments would likely threaten local groundwater, and when necessary the technology in current use, excavation and soil washing, may remain the only viable but expensive alternative. However, under certain conditions it may be possible to introduce metal-binding organisms or nonliving metal biotraps into soils and sediments to enhance the stability of metal ions at contaminated sites. Likewise, it may be possible to even enhance the population of indigenous metal-binding bacteria at contaminated sites by providing to them ﬁxed carbon in gaseous form, e.g. methane or other volatile organics, essentially the reverse in situ bioremediation process known as biosparging. For the immediate future then, new heavy metal bioremediation technologies may be limited to the development of industrial applications for meeting regulatory agency requirements for pretreating wastewaters for later discharge.  6 CONCLUSIONS  Commercially feasible technologies involving traditional physico-chemical and chemical engineering principles are not at all simple or inexpensive, yet they are usually chosen over the few technologies using biological solutions currently available for heavy metal removal and recovery from industrial wastewaters. It is not to be expected that any bioremediation option will itself prove inexpensive. Perhaps it is not surprising that industry has been somewhat reluctant to adopt biological processes for use in metal-removal technologies. The chemical industry requires, and for good reason, reliable processes which are predictable, scalable, and controllable by plant operations personnel. Plant and laboratory aqueous efﬂuents must consistently comply with discharge limits set by governmental regulators. As basic science reveals more and more about how biotraps behave, and as the number of potential materials reported in the scientiﬁc literature increases, many new opportunities for commercial adoption of a suitable biotechnology should begin to appear. Perhaps bioremediation of metal- contaminated sites and wastewaters will then be developed to its full potential and realize the promise of new and reliable technologies. The success will probably depend upon blending of the best technologies the chemical and biological ﬁelds have to offer.

Baker   Greg T. Lonergan Environment and Biotechnology Centre, Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, Australia  1  INTRODUCTION  2 ORGANISMS DEGRADING LIGNIN  Large quantities of toxic and intensely colored waste efﬂuents are produced by a range of industrial processes. These efﬂuents are treated by processes ranging from aerobic to anaerobic and physico-chemical techniques. More innovative technologies using white-rot fungi have also been studied  Kahmark and Unwin 1996 . The use of microorganisms to detoxify environmental pollutants is generally referred to as bioremediation. Environmental issues are now of increasing concern and biological methods are being directed towards technologies to minimize pollution or remedy it if it occurs. White-rot fungi and their ligninolytic enzymes appear to have wide industrial potential. Phanerochaete chrysosporium and Coriolus versicolor can degrade lignin and a number of related chlorinated compounds. They are also able to efﬁciently decolorize and dechlorinate such efﬂuents  Archibald et al. 1990; Fukui et al. 1992; Sundmann et al. 1981 . Efﬁcient color removal from sulﬁte pulping efﬂuents has also been observed with C. versicolor  Bergbauer et al. 1991; Royer et al. 1983 . Furthermore, white-rot fungi are showing signiﬁcant potential to biodegrade a large number of xenobiotic compounds and hazardous wastes  Field et al. 1993; Glaser 1990; Hammel 1989 . Lignin peroxidase, manganese dependent peroxidase, and laccase are the three main ligninolytic enzymes  Leisola and Garcia 1989; Schoemaker et al. 1989  and have been well-studied but several other enzymes are involved in further degradation of the products resulting from their action.  This chapter describes the rationale and results for three related case studies using a white-rot fungus to  a  treat efﬂuent wastewater to reduce color,  b  to decolorize dye solutions used in industrial processes, and  c  to determine the enzyme involved in the decolorization process.  Lignin is an amorphous, highly aromatic heterogenous, 3-D branched polymer  Buswell and Odier 1987; Higuchi 1985  with its substituents connected by carbon – carbon and ether linkages. There are different lignin structures consisting of various amounts of the three cinnamyl alcohol precursors present: p-coumaryl, coniferyl, and synapyl alcohols. These alcohols give rise to p-hydroxyphenyl units, guaiacyl units, and syringyl units, respectively, in lignin  Higuchi 1985; Kirk and Farrell 1987 . The lignin cinnamyl alcohol precursors produce phenoxy radicals which randomly couple.  White-rot is characterized by the bleached white color of advanced wood decay due to fungi  white-rot fungi  and other organisms. White-rot can totally degrade all major wood polymers, including lignin  Crawford and Crawford 1980; Kirk 1971 . Lignin is signiﬁcantly de-aromatized. The degradation follows two general patterns  a  simultaneous attack on lignin and polysaccharides or  b  preferential or selective removal of lignin and or hemicellulose without extensive depletion of cellulose  Buswell 1991 . White-rot fungi degrading lignin in preference to polysaccharides are Pycnoporus cinnabarinus, Pleurotus ostreatus, Phlebia radiata, and Phlebia  Merulius  tremellosus  Ander and Eriksson 1977 .  Other organisms degrading lignin include the brown-rot fungi, the soft-rot fungi, which seem capable of some demethylation and possibly degradation of side chains and aromatic rings  Ander and Eriksson 1978; Buswell 1991  and some bacteria associated with the Actinomycetes and Eubacteria  Kirk 1971 . Bacteria may extensively degrade, demethoxylate, and side chains.  and modify aromatic  rings  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

A necessary criterion for the application of these dyes is that they resist photodegradation and wash- ing processes. In addition, these dyes are also resistant to microbial degradation and are not easily removed from wastes during conventional biological treatment  Meyer 1981; Shaul et al. 1991 . The removal of synthetic dyes from waste- waters is mainly achieved by elimination of the dye stuffs using adsorption, chemical oxidation, and ﬂocculation.  removal of color  Azo linkages and aromatic sulfo groups do not occur naturally and they resist oxidative degradation. Partial degradation has been observed for anthraquinone and azo dyes during aerobic activated sludge treatment, but substantial from the wastewater was attributed to adsorption of the intact dye onto the sludge  Athanasopoulos 1991 . The dyestuffs are generally more susceptible to anaerobic sludge degradation. The anaerobic reduction of azo dyes to colorless products by bacteria has been reported  Meyer 1981 . The initial step in this transformation is the reductive ﬁssion of the azo group, resulting in the formation and accumulation of toxic and possibly carcinogenic rapid decolorization of a number of textile dyes and efﬂuents by an immobilized anaerobic consortium had also been demonstrated  Nigam et al. 1996; Oxspring et al. 1996 .  amines. The  aromatic  The ability of P. chrysosporium to decolorize polymeric dyes, such as Poly B-411, Poly R-481, and Poly Y-606, has been correlated with its lignin degrading system  Glenn and Gold 1983; Gold et al. 1983; 1988 . Strains of P. ostreatus have also been shown to effectively decolorize Poly B-411  Platt et al. 1985 . P. pulmonarius increased Poly B decolorization, as well as enhanced laccase production. Laccase is often produced by Pleurotus sp. as part of their ligninolytic system but dye decolorization by this fungus  Table 1 Dyes decolorized by Phanerochaete chrysosporium  appears to be unrelated due to increased laccase secretion  Masaphy and Levanon 1992 .  The utilization of the white-rot fungi and their nonspeciﬁc ligninolytic enzyme system for the biodegradation of other industrial dyes has found increased interest, since it has also become known that P. chrysosporiurm is able to degrade and decolorize a range of azo, sulfonated dyes, heterocyclic, and triphenylmethane dyes  Bumpus and Brock 1988; Cripps et al. 1990; Paszczynski et al. 1992; Spadaro et al. 1992   Table 1 . The triphenylmethane dye, crystal violet, has been decolorized by P. chrysosporium. Three metabolites were identiﬁed and the dye was N-demethylated by puriﬁed lignin peroxidase providing further evidence that the ligninolytic system is at involved in oxidative biodegradation  Bumpus and Brock 1988 . Pararosaniline and cresol violet and cresol red were also decolorized.  least  A number of other azo, sulfonated azo, triphenylmethane, and heterocyclic dyes can also be degraded by various strains of P. chrysosporium  Table 1 . This further demonstrates the usefulness of the ligninolytic system in biodegrading and decolorizing wastewaters contaminated with dyes from textile and other industries  Cripps et al. 1990 . Fluorescein acid  Gogna et al. 1992  and thiazine dyes  Kling and Neto 1991  have also been degraded by P. chrysosporium or lignin peroxidase. Many studies have used P. chrysosporium, although a H2O2-dependent enzymatic decolorization by P. ostreatus has also been shown  Vyas and Molitoris 1995 . Knapp et al.  1995  suggests that more work on the effect of the decolorizing capacity of other members of the Basidiomycetes is warranted.  4 LIGNINOLYSIS AND DECOLORIZATION  BY ENZYMES  A number of white-rot fungi and or their enzymes have been used successfully in detoxiﬁcation and degradation of  Organism  Dye class  Dye  References  P. chrysosporium BKM 1667  ATCC 24725  P. chrysosporium OGC 101  Sulfonated azo dyes Azo dyes  Paszczynski et al.  1992  Spadaro et al.  1993   P. chrysosporium BKM-F-1767  Azo dyes  Cripps et al.  1990   P. chrysosporium ME-446  Glenn and Gold  1983   Heterocyclic dyes Polymeric dyes  Synthesized dyes Disperse yellow 3 Disperse orange 3 Solvent yellow 14 Tropabolin O Orange II Congo red Azure B Poly B-441 Poly R-481 Poly Y-606 Crystal violet Rose Bengal  P. chrysosporium BKM-F-1767 P. chrysosporium BKM-1667  ATTC 24725   Triphenylmethane dyes Fluorescein acid dye  Bumpus and Brock  1988  Gogna et al.  1992   Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

The result is the formation of opened-ring products, small aromatic fragments, and quinones and these can be further metabolized.  4.1 Lignin Peroxidase  it  is now generally known as  A lignin-degrading enzyme from P. chrysosporium was identiﬁed in 1983 by two independent research teams  Glenn et al. 1983; Tien and Kirk 1983 . This enzyme was termed ligninase, but lignin peroxidase. The enzyme was shown to partly depolymerize lignin, but can cleave Ca – Cb linkages in side chains suggesting that the depolymerizing and ring cleavage ability of this enzyme constitutes its main function in lignin degradation  Chen and Chang 1985; Eriksson et al. 1990 . The enzyme has also been found in other fungi including C. versicolor  Dodson et al. 1987; Jo¨nsson et al. 1987; Waldner et al. 1988 , P. radiata  Hatakka et al. 1987; Kantelinen et al. 1988; Niku-Paavola 1987; Niku-Paavola et al. 1988  and P. tremellosus  Biswas-Hawkes et al. 1987 .  4.2 Manganese Dependent Peroxidase  A similar enzyme,  One year after detection of lignin peroxidase, Kuwahara et al.  1984  reported the isolation of another enzyme fraction from P. chrysosporium strain ME 446. This fraction showed Mn II , H2O2 and lactate dependency and stimulation by increased protein concentration in reaction mixtures. The enzyme can oxidize a variety of dyes, including phenol red, o-dianisidine, and Poly R. Puriﬁcation and characterization of this manganese dependent peroxi- dase was subsequently carried out  Glenn and Gold 1985 . tentatively named vanillylacetone peroxidase was puriﬁed from P. chrysosporium strain BKM-1767  Paszczynski et al. 1985 . This enzyme oxidized various low-molecular weight phenols and an aromatic amine in the presence of Mn II  and H2O2. It did not oxidize phenol red and was not activated by lactate. The enzyme oxidized NADPH and reduced glutathione  GSH  thereby, possibly, indicating a link with xenobiotic metabolism. Hydrogen peroxide was formed in this reaction. Generation of hydrogen peroxide from GSH occurs with a manganese dependent peroxidase from Lentinus edodes  Forrester et al. 1988 .  Manganese accumulation in the decayed residue of wood  Blanchette 1984  supported the hypothesis that manganese dependent peroxidases participated in lignin degradation  Paszczynski et al. 1985  via oxidation to a higher oxidation state  Glenn et al. 1986; Paszczynski et al. 1986 . Manganese  4.3 Laccase: Role and Function in Lignin  Biodegradation  Laccases classiﬁed as polyphenoloxidases are now widely accepted as p-diphenoloxidases  EC 1.10.3.2   Tuor et al. 1995  and are widespread. The enzyme is found in many plant species  Mayer and Harel 1979  and is widely distributed in fungi  Mayer 1987  including wood-rotting fungi where it is often associated with lignin peroxidase, manganese dependent peroxidase, or both  Nerud and Misˇurcova´ 1996; Tuor et al. 1995 . They are remarkably nonspeciﬁc as to reducing substrates and show much in common with another copper-containing oxidase, tyrosinase  monophenol mono-oxygenase; EC 1.14.18.1 .  Laccases are blue copper oxidases and participate in electron transfer in biological systems by catalyzing the four- electron reduction of dioxygen to water with the simul- taneous oxidation of organic substrates  Reinhammar and Malmstro¨m 1981; Thurston 1994 . A minimum of four copper atoms, distributed in three spectroscopically distinct binding sites, appears necessary to facilitate efﬁcient catalysis. The Type I  blue  copper center has a strong absorbance near 600 nm and gives rise to the enzyme’s blue color. The other two copper centers known as the Type II  normal  and the Type III involve a pair of magnetically coupled cupric ions  Farver and Pecht 1981; Li et al. 1992; Morpurgo et al. 1993 . Studies into the mechanism of the reduction of O2 to H2O by laccases have shown that a bridge between the coupled binuclear center and the Type II center deﬁnes a trinuclear cluster as the active site  Solomon 1988 .  Plant laccase mechanism and function has been investi- gated predominantly on Rhus vernicifera. It is thought that the enzyme has a protective function, possibly causing formation of a natural polyphenolic polymerisate in the case of tree damage  Reinhammar and Malmstro¨m 1981 . A plant laccase has also been found to be involved in ligniﬁcation  Bao et al. 1993  and the role of laccase in ligniﬁcation has been reviewed extensively by O’Malley et al.  1993 .  Fungal  laccases oxidize phenols and phenolic sub- structures of lignin with subsequent polymerization or depolymerization  Higuchi 1989 . These pathways are considered to proceed via phenoxy radicals of the phenolic units. The role of laccase in lignin biodegradation remains largely unresolved, since strains of the extensively studied fungus, P. chrysosporium, and several other white-rot Basidiomycetes are active in lignin degradation but do not produce laccase under the ligninolytic conditions employed in laboratory studies  Nerud and Misˇurcova´ 1996; Thurston 1994; Tuor et al. 1995 .  In some fungi, laccase has a function seemingly unrelated to ligninolysis. For example, in Aspergillus nidulans, the  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   enzyme appears to be essential for the synthesis of the spore pigments  Clutterbuck 1972 .  5 CASE 1—DECOLORIZATION OF AN  INDUSTRIAL WASTE  5.1 The Composition of the Waste  The initial problem was to decolorize the complex waste- water from an industrial site. The waste originated in a pigment plant and advice indicated that it contained low molecular weight alkyd  sic  polyester resins derived from the reaction of triglycerides and anhydrides like phthalic anhydride along with epoxide resins, derived from bisphenol, and epichlorohydrin and amine resins from melamine and formaldehyde. Lesser quantities of higher molecular weight materials, from polymerization of vinyl, acrylate, or methacrylate monomers were also present. The efﬂuent had a total organic carbon content  TOC  of 2770 mg l and a total suspended content  TSC  of 7429 mg l.  5.2 Selection of Decolorizing Organisms  In view of the numerous reports of involvement in dye decolorization and lignin degradation  Sections 2 and 3  the white-rot fungi were considered the organisms of choice for this work. It was essential that the organism could either grow on or metabolize the efﬂuent. Plates of malt extract agar  MEA  were prepared in the efﬂuent diluted to contain 695, 1389, 2083, and 2770 mg l TOC, respectively. They were adjusted to pH 4.5 to aid fungal growth. Plates were centrally inoculated with several white-rot fungi that had been collected in Victoria, Australia, and some standard strains. The plates were grown under high humidity and examined daily.  The most appropriate organism was judged to be a strain of a Victoria isolate of P. cinnabarinus, identiﬁed according to Fuhrer  1985  and Macdonald and Westerman  1979 . In the presence of a primary carbon source  and a TOC of the efﬂuent of 1385 mg l  this fungus covered the entire plate in 96 h. This TOC concentration was also used in bioreactor experiments.  5.3 Conditions in a Packed-Bed Bioreactor  Most degradation studies employing Phanerochaete have been carried out in solid cultures or in shallow liquid stationary or shake cultures  Ander and Eriksson 1977; Hatakka 1985 . Packed-bed bioreactor conﬁgurations have been mainly used to study the ligninolytic enzymes and degradative abilities of P. chrysosporium  Lewandowski et al. 1990; Linko 1988 . In view of this it was decided to examine the effect of the fungus on the industrial waste in a 2 l packed-bed reactor.  w  The strain of P. cinnabarinus was inoculated onto a nylon web cube support  0.5 cm3 of Scotchbrite  . The efﬂuent was prepared in a deﬁned medium  Tien and Kirk 1988  which was modiﬁed by increasing the ﬁnal concentration of diammonium tartrate to 0.8 g l to give a carbon to nitrogen ratio of 38.3:1. Although it stimulated phenoloxidase activity, veratryl alcohol  40 mM  was omitted in this trial because it retarded mycelial growth, inhibited glucose and nitrogen utilization and delayed decolorization. Addition of veratryl alcohol at the time of inoculation may interfere with fungal metabolism  Tonon and Odier 1988 .  The medium was circulated through the reactor at 0.45 l h and samples were taken daily and analyzed for glucose concentration, available nitrogen, and oxidative enzyme activity which at this stage was termed phenoloxidase. A control reactor lacking the efﬂuent was also used.  5.4 Decolorization in the Reactor  The results are summarized as follows for a 15-day reactor cycle. The desirable characteristics of vigorous growth and rapid decolorization  Joyce et al. 1984  were achieved by omitting veratryl alcohol from the medium in the reactor cycle. In this case, the nitrogen was consumed in 24 h and glucose in 48 h. The phenoloxidase reached a level of 4.8 units of ABTS* oxidized ml on day 9 and then declined to remain at a relatively steady level of 1.85 U ml for the rest of the cycle. This decrease broadly coincided with detection of autolytic activity and reappearance of nitrogen in the medium. The dark efﬂuent was rapidly decolorized during the ﬁrst 24 h. The fungal mycelium was originally dark suggesting the adsorption of some of the solid by the mycelium. This intensity decreased over the 15-day cycle until the mycelium became indistinguishable from the control. The ﬁnal efﬂuent was a light yellow.  There were differences in the spectra at different stages of decolorization of the efﬂuent and some of these are shown in Figure 1. In this increased decolorizing effect three stages are suggested. Firstly some of the color adsorbs to the enhanced mycelial mass formed in the absence of veratryl alcohol. Secondly, the phenoloxidase acts to decolorize the soluble dye components of the efﬂuent and thirdly the phenoloxidase acts on the adsorbed color of the mycelium in situ. Evidence that the phenoloxidase was most probably a laccase is reported in Section 6.  6 CASE 2—DECOLORIZATION OF  CHICAGO SKY BLUE  6.1 Structure of the Dye  Chicago Sky Blue  Figure 2  is a disazo dye used extensively in dyeing cotton and cellulosic ﬁber material. It is often  *One unit  U  of enzyme activity is deﬁned as the amount of enzyme causing a change in absorbance of 1.0 min  Bourbonnais and Paice 1990 .  21 at room temperature  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

It belongs to the largest class of commercially produced water-soluble dyes that are characterized by up to three azo linkages which link phenyl and naphthyl groups containing combinations of functional groups  sulfonic acid, sodium salt; amino; chloro; hydroxyl; methyl and nitro  on the rings.  Decolorization and degradation of azo dyes have been demonstrated with P. chrysosporium  Cripps et al. 1990; Ollikka et al. 1993; Pasti-Grigsby et al. 1992; Paszczynski et al. 1991; 1992; Spadaro et al. 1992 . A lignin peroxidase of this organism catalyses the decolorization of azo, hetero- cyclic, triphenylmethane, and polymeric dyes  Ollikka et al. 1993 .  Much less is known about the role of laccases in the decolorization of synthetic dyes, although several wood- rotting fungi produce laccase as well as peroxidases and have been shown to decolorize a range of structurally different dyes  Knapp et al. 1995 . A mechanism for degradation of phenolic azo dyes by laccase from Pyricularia oryzae  Chivukula and Renganathan 1995  is similar to the one proposed for degradation of phenolic azo dyes by a lignin peroxidase  Chivukula et al. 1995 . In the latter case formation of novel sulfophenyl hydroperoxides was postu- lated and the elimination of the azo linkage as molecular nitrogen. However, in the case of laccase, electron-rich  Figure 2 Structural formula of Chicago sky blue  CSB .  phenolic rings adjacent to the azo linkage appeared necessary for oxidation and phenoxy radical formation. Mass spectral  MS  and electrospray ionization  EI  – MS analyses con- ﬁrmed the release of azo linkages as molecular nitrogen. This prevented aromatic amine formation.  6.2 Decolorization of CSB Using Pycnoporus  cinnabarinus  The isolate of P. cinnabarinus was examined for its ability to decolorize CBB on plates initially, then in shake ﬂasks and subsequently in 2 and 10 l packed-bed bioreactors. In every case the dye was decolorized at relatively high concentrations  500 mg l .  6.3 Enzymes Involved in the Degradation  The decolorization of the dye by P. cinnabarinus led to a search for the responsible enzymes. In the early experiments, solutions had been tested in the presence of a catalase from Aspergillus niger. Despite the catalase the ABTS was still oxidized. This suggested an involvement of laccase in the decolorization reaction and a search was undertaken to see whether it acted alone or whether it required other mediators.  6.4 Production and Puriﬁcation of Laccase from  Pycnoporus cinnabarinus  In the 10 l packed-bed bioreactor, P. cinnabarinus used glucose at a constant rate. The ammonia content of the medium was exhausted by day 4. Laccase activity was ﬁrst detected on day 4 and had reached 0.28 U ml by day 10 when the culture broth was harvested for laccase puriﬁcation.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   The isolation procedure follows that of Schliephake et al.  2000 . Laccase was puriﬁed from 7.9 l of culture ﬂuid in two ultraﬁltration steps followed by concentration, dialysis, and column chromatography on Sephadex G 75. Fractions absorbing at 614 nm were analyzed for laccases activity, pooled, dialyzed against 20 mM histidine buffer pH 6, and again concentrated. The concentrate was chromatographed on a 5 5 Mono Q anion exchange column with a sodium chloride gradient of 0 – 0.5 M over 50 min at 1 ml min. Fractions absorbing at 614 nm were pooled and stored at 2 858C in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture. A 45-fold increase in speciﬁc activity was obtained on puriﬁcation. Capillary electrophoresis estimated purity at greater than 95% with minor peaks  areas 0.079 and 4.596%  at longer elution times.  6.5 Characterization of Laccase  The enzyme contained 510 amino acid residues and was a single polypeptide of a molecular size of 63 kDa. It contained 11% carbohydrate that is consistent with other laccases  Coll et al. 1993 . The ﬁrst 10 amino acids at the N-terminal were A, I, G, P, V, A, B, L, T, and L and differed from the enzyme from P. cinnabarinus PB, also isolated in Australia, only in the B for D in residue 7  Eggert et al. 1996 . It also showed considerable homology to the laccase of P. ostreatus  Youn et al. 1995 , C.  Trametes  versicolor  Bourbonnais et al. 1995 , and Coriolus hirsutus  Kojima et al. 1990 .  A major band and two minor bands were observed at pH 3 and pH 2.85 and 2.65, respectively, on isoelectric focusing  IEF . Each band stained the laccase substrate guaiacol  10 mM . One band only, corresponding to laccase activity, was obtained on electrophoresis  4 – 20% gradient gel  under nondenaturing conditions. This band, stained with 10 mM guaiacol, corresponded with the co-electrophoresis protein band.  6.6 Properties  The ultra-violet visible  UV Vis  absorption spectrum of laccase was similar to that observed of other fungal laccases  Coll et al. 1993; Eggert et al. 1996  with a Type I band at 614 nm, corresponding to the blue copper of laccases  Reinhammer and Malstro¨m 1981  and a broad band at 330 nm indicative of a Type III binuclear copper center  Malkin et al. 1969; Reinhammer 1984 . The EPR spectrum of puriﬁed laccase had two superimposed signals of Type I and Type II copper centers.  The laccase was stable at 608C for1 h and still retained much activity after 2 h incubation at 808C. It differed from the laccase of P. cinnabarinus PB  Eggert et al. 1996  which was inactivated after incubation at 808C for 1 h. The enzyme was still active in bioreactors run at 378C for 25 days but lost activity on prolonged treatment at the higher temperatures.  The pH optimum for syringaldazine was between pH 4.4 and 5 and for guaiacol between pH 4 and 4.5. The Km was  0.03 mM for syringaldazine and 0.33 mM guaiacol. Activity was irreversibly inhibited by 0.1 mM sodium azide and by ascorbic acid at 1 mM.  6.7 Decolorization Using Puriﬁed Enzyme  In degradation studies, the absorbance of the dye at 618 nm  25 mg CSB l  was monitored against a heat treated blank. The rate of decolorization was initially linear  0.82 – 25 mg protein , and proportional to enzyme concentration but equilibrium was reached after 2 h. The major CSB peak at 618 nm and minor peak at 320 nm disappeared and a new peak appeared at 550 nm.  The dye had a retention time of 22 min on HPLC  C18 reversed phase column   Schliephake et al. 2000 . After 20 h reaction time the 22 min peak disappeared and two new peaks appeared with retention times of 1.28 and 3.96 min, respectively. Their molar absorptivities were an order of magnitude lower than CSB. Thus, the disazo dye CSB had been clearly degraded by the activity of the laccase. The products have not been characterized so far.  7 CASE 3—DECOLORIZATION OF  REMAZOL BRILLIANT BLUE  7.1 Laccase and Remazol Brilliant Blue  Laccase was shown to be a major extracellular enzyme of P. cinnabarinus and responsible for decolorization of CSB and most likely the pigmented wastewater. A number of successful trials of the strain P. cinnabarinus in decolorizing the vinyl sulfonyl industrial dye, Remazol Brilliant Blue R  RBBR   Figure 3 , were carried out on the laboratory scale  Jones et al. 1993; Lonergan et al. 1993 . Remazol Brilliant Blue R is used for dyeing jeans. Subsequently a puriﬁed laccase from P. cinnabarinus was also shown to be involved in the decolorization of industrial grade and puriﬁed RBBR  Lonergan et al. 1996 .  It therefore seemed appropriate to monitor the laccase development of P. cinnabarinus during a dye decolorization reactor cycle on a pilot scale prior to an industrial scale up. A 200 l packed-bed bioreactor was designed for the pilot scale run  Lonergan et al. 1995a,b . This pilot reactor trial provided much larger and more active samples from which laccase could be puriﬁed.  Figure 3 Structural formula of RBBR.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   7.2 The Pilot Scale Bioreactor  w  The fermentation was conducted in a 200 l aerated polythene drum, packed with 2 cm3 nylon  Scotchbrite   cubes  Lonergan et al. 1995 b . A reactor cycle of 25 days was used in this instance with the medium continually recycled at 36 ^ 18C. P. cinnabarinus rapidly colonized the packing. Veratryl alcohol  4 mM  was used as a laccase inducing agent. The RBBR was added  500 mg l  to the medium on day 3 after inoculation. Daily samples were analyzed for glucose, nitrogen, and phenoloxidase  laccase  activity. A sample was also taken 30 min after addition of the dye and is termed  D3 þ 30.  7.3 Decolorization of Dye in Bioreactor  The dye  595 nm  was decolorized by 80% within 24 h and almost completely decolorized within 48 h after addition. The nitrogen in the reactor was exhausted in 7 days and the glucose exhausted in 12 days whereupon more glucose was added to the reactor  Lonergan et al. 1995b . There was a small increase in nitrogen towards the end of the cycle due to autolysis.  Laccase activity was detected on day 2, peaked at a very large 60 U ml on day 8 and fell to a minimum on day 12. It then rose again towards the end of the cycle as the additional glucose was added.  In this series of experiments laccases were puriﬁed from 100 ml samples removed during the reactor operation on day  3, D3 þ 30, 4, 20, 23, and 25 by a slight modiﬁcation to the  method reported  Schliephake et al. 2000 . The elution proﬁles for all samples were similar to those of the laccase puriﬁcation carried out on the Mono Q anion exchanger. The elution pattern for days 4 and 23 are shown in Figure 4. The anomaly in enzyme elution times  day 4, 18.5 min and day 23, 15.5 min  was examined.  7.4 Variation in Enzyme  The apparent molecular weight of laccase, previously estimated at 63 kDa by SDS-PAGE  Schliepake et al. 2000   was consistent in the laccase from days 3, D3 þ 30 min, 4,  and 20. The protein bands from samples on days 23 and 25 migrated further in the gel and gave a molecular weight of 54,620.  On electrophoresis of the puriﬁed reactor samples, under native conditions, and visualizing laccase active bands with guaiacol, signiﬁcant variation occurred in the migration of the enzyme through the gel from different days. Electro- phoretic migration of proteins under nondissociating buffer conditions occurs on the basis of both size and charge  Hames 1990 . This variation in migration indicated that physical transformation of the enzyme may have occurred during the reactor cycle without loss of the enzyme activity.  Figure 4 Elution proﬁle of laccases from day 4  A  and day 23  B . The 100 ml sample was concentrated to 5 ml, passed through Sephadex G 75 and active fragments pooled. The active solution was concentrated through Centricon ultraﬁlters and the concentrate passed through a Bioscale 5 anion exchange column, using the same gradient as for the Mono Q column but spread over 35 min and at a same ﬂow rate of 1 ml min.  Puriﬁed laccases were subjected to IEF and stained for activity. The enzymic banding pattern showed signiﬁcant variation on days 3, 4, 20, 23, and 25. The activity stain showed that on day 3, prior to the addition of the dye to the reactor, ﬁve bands stained for laccase activity, with the strongest staining bands towards the anode. On day 4, six bands were observed and the band closer to the cathode had the stronger stain. A similar pattern was also observed on day 20 of the reactor cycle. On day 23 and 25, however, there were only four bands and the band nearest the anode was again the strongest staining band. Such a pattern of laccase on IEF was considered artifacts due to the nature of the gel  Eggert et al. 1996 . The variations, together with the migration on the native PAGE, however, did not exclude modiﬁcation of the enzyme over the reactor cycle.  The decolorizing activity of  laccases during a 7 h incubation varied substantially for the different days investigated  Figure 5 . Day 4 laccase decolorized RBBR at the fastest rate. This particular enzyme had been isolated from the reactor one day after the addition of the dye. The second most active laccase was isolated from day 3, i.e., before dye  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

On puriﬁcation the phenoloxidase of the enzyme showed all the characteristics of a laccase. The puriﬁed laccase from the white-rot fungus rapidly decolorized both dyes. There appeared to be some charge to size variations of laccase during the reactor cycle. It may be hypothesized that the dye may have acted on a proportion of laccase molecules in such a way that it modulated the protein. This could give rise to a conformational change, which may optimize the catalytic site of the enzyme in such a way that it is more easily accessible. As the dye molecule  is very small ðFW , 625Þ and contains a free aromatic  amino group, there could be a possible reaction occurring between a possibly free carboxyl groups of an exposed amino acid of laccase and the amino group of the dye. This would mean that such amino-containing molecules under certain circumstances might behave like amino acids. Such a modulation could possibly explain the presence of an additional acidic band appearing closer to the cathode upon exposure to the dye.  REFERENCES  Ander P and Eriksson K-E  1977 .

Laccases from days 23 and 25 were initially less efﬁcient. However, the spectra after 20 h reaction showed the extent of removal of the peak around 595 nm and the most efﬁcient color removal was observed for laccases from day 4 and 25  Figure 6 . Although the rate of decolorization for day 25 laccase had appeared slower over the ﬁrst 7 h  Figure 5 , its decolorization efﬁciency had proceeded further after 20 h. This observation is probably related to the observed differences in electrophoretic properties.  Figure 6 UV Vis spectra of solutions shown in Figure 5 after a 20 h reaction time.

After the distillation process all the ingredients of the original fermented mash or liquid, except volatiles, remain in the waste, called stillage, spent wash, slop, or vinasse. The composition of this distillery waste depends on the original raw materials used: sugarcane- or sugar beet molasses, corn, wheat, barley, cassava, potato, rice, fruits, etc. These materials have to be prepared for alcoholic fermentation by dilution or mashing, including eventual hydrolysis and or addition of nutrients. Stillages remaining after distilling off the alcohol are troublesome wastewaters that are either pulpy materials or clear ﬂuids containing settling particles. The stillages are about 10 – 14 times the volume of the alcohol produced and have a high content of organic substances  Shojaosadati et al. 1999 . The pollution load is quantiﬁed by biochemical oxygen demand  BOD  and chemical oxygen demand  COD . Distillery stillages are characterized by a very high BOD, very high COD, and a low pH value. In addition, with certain types of distillery wastewater such as fruit slops, the separation of solids from the liquid is almost impossible  Friedrich et al. 1986 . There are substantial pressures to develop a proper treatment for making wastes acceptable. A text on organic waste conversion  Bewick 1980 , as well as several review articles, discusses the problem of distillery wastewater  Costa Ribeiro and Castello Branco 1980; Sheehan and Greenﬁeld 1980; Weathers 1995; Wilkie et al. 2000 . There are many potential solutions for these problems, including simple disposal, sewage treatment, and recovery of useful ingredients. In addition, many attempts have been made to exploit the organic compounds from stillages in biotechnological processes for the production of commercially valuable products. Industrial and experimental utilization and disposal  of efﬂuents and properties of stillage of different origins have been reviewed and compared by Wilkie et al.  2000 .  The presence of a large amount of organic substances of natural origin opens up the possibility of bioconversion by microorganisms. While bacteria participate in anaerobic processes producing biogas, fungi are suitable for aerobic bioconversion. There have been several attempts to use fungi for treating distillery wastewaters. The aim of microbiological treatment is to purify the efﬂuent by consumption of organic substances, thus, reducing its COD and BOD, and at the same time to obtain some valuable product, such as fungal biomass for protein-rich animal feed, or some speciﬁc fungal metabolite. The present review deals with the application of fungi for treating distillery stillages or slops. Suitable fungi, the bioconversion process, possible products and effects, together with economic considerations are described.  2 DISTILLERY WASTE  Distillery stillages have a complex organic and inorganic composition. The most important characteristics, in terms of their organic strength and nutrient content are given in Table 1.  As can be seen, the values of BOD and COD may vary signiﬁcantly and may reach extremely high values of over 300 and more than 150 g l, respectively. The pH ranges from 3 to 5. The waste can contain different amounts of solids up to more than 400 g l. For cultivating microorganisms, the content of carbon and nitrogen sources is the most important factor. The ratio of C:N varies with the raw material used for alcoholic fermentation. In addition to the components given in Table 1, there are different amounts of organic and amino acids, polyols, vitamins, phenolics, etc. Minerals include potassium, phosphorus, sulfates, and some heavy metals. These components may also have an important inﬂuence on  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

The organism has to be able to utilize the substrate effectively and at the same time its biomass has to have a high nutritive value, especially in its protein content. According to Tomlinson  1976a  the lower and higher fungi are the most suitable for bioprocessing distillery wastes.  3.1 Yeasts  Yeasts have been chosen in the great majority of cases for cultivation in distillery stillages of different origin. They have been commonly used in food preparation for thousands of years so there are no prejudices regarding their use for food or feed, as is the case with bacteria and molds. The quick growth of yeasts lead to advantages of time and low cost, as well as limited possibility of contamination by other microorganisms. The fermentation process is easy to handle and continuous cultivation is possible. The use of yeast is interesting because of its low price and its high protein and vitamin content. However, some facts must be taken into account  Huyard et al. 1986 :  a  the yeast should not contain high levels of contaminants, if it is to be used for feed,  b  energy is needed for separating the yeast from the substrate,  c  effective aeration is necessary, and  d  the remaining efﬂuent still has a high COD and needs to be treated in a sewage treatment facility.  Candida  Torula  is the fungal organism most used for molasses stillages and to a lesser extent for other distillery efﬂuents. Other yeasts are also suitable for bioconversion of  molasses stillage. In screening for a useful yeast, Hansenula, Debaromyces, and Rhodotorula were selected out of 203 strains  Akaki et al. 1981 . Hansenula spp.  Moriya et al. 1990; Shojaosadati et al. 1999  and Debaromyces sp.  Selim et al. 1991  were also successful as were Saccharomyces cerevisiae  Selim et al. 1991 , Kluyveromyces spp.  Braun and Meyrath 1981; Selim et al. 1991 , Pichia tainania  Chang and Yang 1973; Lin et al. 1973  and Phafﬁa rhodozyma  Fontana et al. 1997 . Rhodotorula glutinis produced biomass for fodder rich in vitamin B on raisin vinasse  Aran 1977; Yaziciog˘lu et al. 1980 . A distillery efﬂuent from rice spirit production could be successfully reused by a S. cerevisiae strain  Yang and Tung 1996 .  3.2 Filamentous Fungi  Compared to yeasts, ﬁlamentous fungi have been used less frequently for bioconversion of distillery wastes. The reasons might be that they are slower growing and more susceptible to infection. However, ﬁlamentous fungi have some advantages as they produce a series of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes and are therefore able to exploit complex carbohydrates without prior hydrolysis; this property enables them to grow in starch and cellulose substrates. The second advantage is in their ﬁlamentous morphology that allows separation of the biomass by simple ﬁltration. Compared to yeasts, ﬁlamentous fungi have lower sensitivity to variations in temperature, pH, nutrients, and aeration, and they also have a lower nucleic acid content in the biomass  Arau´jo et al. 1977 . Various species of fungi were used for distillery stillage fermentations, among them Aspergillus spp. being the most popular ones. Aspergillus oryzae  Arau´jo et al. 1977; De Lamo and De Menezes 1978  and Aspergillus niger  De Lamo and De Menezes 1978  were selected out of several ﬁlamentous fungi due to their high biomass yield, rapid ﬁltration, and substantial COD reduction in cane molasses stillage. A. niger was also suitable for bioconversion of rice spirit  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.    Yang and Lin 1998 . Aspergillus awamori var. kawachi and Aspergillus usami mut. shirousami were used for bioconver- sion of distillery waste of a Japanese alcohol beverage, shochu  Kida et al. 1995; Morimura et al. 1991; 1992; 1994a . Filamentous fungi were chosen for conversion of stillage, due to their texture, protein proﬁle, and easy harvesting, and Aspergillus phoenicis was the most promising among isolates from contaminated stillage  De Gonza´les and De Murphy 1979 . Aspergillus species were also suitable for converting fruit based distillery stillages, A. niger biomass produced in vinasse from raisin brandy has a good amino acid content  Aran 1977; Yaziciog˘lu et al. 1980 , while cellulolytic Aspergillus species were very effective in improving ﬁltration and reducing COD of apple brandy slops  Friedrich et al. 1983; 1986; 1987; Gunde-Cimerman et al. 1986; Perdih et al. 1991 . Many other fungi proved promising in treating and converting different kinds of stillages. For example, Penicillium species were chosen for utilization of white wine vinasse, due to their good adaptation, utilization of the medium, and development at low pH values  Magny et al. 1977 . Penicillium oxalicum produced the highest biomass amount with high protein content in raisin brandy vinasse  Aran 1977; Yaziciog˘lu et al. 1980 . Geotrichum candidum was selected from a variety of soil microorganisms for whisky stillage conversion  Quinn and Marchant 1979a,b; 1980  and for decolorizing molasses stillage, since it was able to reduce the phenolic compounds  Fitzgibbon et al. 1995; 1998 . Compared to several yeasts, molds, and bacteria, Paecilo- myces varioti was very effective in aerobic treatment  Nudel et al. 1987  and for producing single cell protein  SCP  from cane molasses stillage  Azzam and Heikel 1989; Cabib et al. 1983 . Gliocladium deliquescens performed best among different fungi in rum distillery wastewater  Rolz et al. 1975 . Acremonium fusidioides was isolated from soil, treated with stillage, and it clariﬁed and decolorized the efﬂuent and produced the highest biomass amount  Rosalem et al. 1985 . Trichoderma species were successfully utilized in aerobic treatment of cane molasses stillage  Nudel et al. 1987  and for bioconversion of fruit distillery slops; the fungi degraded raw ﬁbers, exhibited high cellulolytic activity, and produced high protein content in the biomass  Friedrich et al. 1986; Perdih et al. 1991 . Fusarium moniliforme grown in vinasse from raisin brandy produced high lipid biomass  Aran 1977; Yaziciog˘lu et al. 1980 . Myrothecium verrucaria was effective in reducing organic substances in apple distillery slop as well as in improving its ﬁlterability  Friedrich et al. 1986 . Aureobasidium sp. could produce a biopolymer pullulan from corn condensed distiller’s solubles  Leathers and Gupta 1994 . Among the microorganisms tested for the treatment and bioconversion of shochu, a Japanese distilled spirit, zygomycetous fungi, Absidia atrospora and Gongro- nella butleri strains were selected and used in a cost effective procedure for chitosan production in the wastewater  Yokoi et al. 1998 .  The development of basidiomycetous fungi  mushrooms  in submerged culture is interesting because of their probable suitability as cheap substitutes for mushroom fruiting bodies  in certain kinds of food. Falanghe  1962  investigated the suitability of stillage for growing mushroom mycelia as a source of protein and fat. Among ten strains cultivated in submerged conditions, Agaricus campestris and Boletus indecisus were chosen as the two most suitable. A. campestris was more effective in producing mycelial protein content. B. indecisus, however, exhibited a greater ability for mycelial production. The dried mycelia had a pleasant slight ﬂavor and they seemed to have adequate characteristics for improving foods; their growth in pellet form enabled easy separation from the medium. In apple distillery slop, Phanerochaete chrysosporium grew successfully; it reduced the amount of ﬁber and improved protein content in the biomass  Friedrich et al. 1986 . Coriolus versicolor and P. chrysosporium could be used for reducing pollution and decolorizing the diluted molasses spent wash  Fitzgibbon et al. 1995; 1998 . Other white rot fungi, Funalia trogii and Trametes versicolor were used for producing plant growth hormones in vinasse from molasses and, in addition, partial COD and color were removed  Yu¨rekli et al. 1999 .  3.3 Mixed Cultures  Some research was done on the use of mixed cultures of different microorganisms to improve the utilization of nutrients in stillage and to obtain better yields of biomass. Combinations of different yeasts, yeasts and bacteria, yeasts and molds or different molds were studied. Biomass yield of the mixed cultures can be substantially higher than that of pure cultures. A two-step fermentation proved to be very effective. Yeast was used in the ﬁrst step to produce large amounts of biomass, and a ﬁlamentous fungus in the second step markedly reduced the COD of the efﬂuent  Azzam and Heikel 1989; Bottaro Castilla et al. 1984; Nudel et al. 1987 . In malt whisky spent wash a three-membered mixed culture of G. candidum, Hansenula anomala, and Candida krusei constituted a stable population. The relative proportions of the three organisms were dependent on the dilution rate during continuous cultivation  Barker et al. 1982 . Thirteen different yeast species, mainly Candia spp. and Trichosporon spp., were used in a mixed culture for treating the vinasse of beet molasses  Malnou et al. 1987 . Mixed cultures of two ascomycetous fungi, A. awamori and Trichoderma reesei, were tested in apple slops; they expressed the positive properties of both genera: Aspergillus improved the ﬁltration time and COD reduction whereas Trichoderma decreased ﬁber and increased protein content in the biomass  Friedrich et al. 1987 .  4 BIOCONVERSION PROCESS  The stillage may be used as a fermentation medium directly after distillation, or it may be pretreated by clariﬁcation, dilution, pH adjustment, and sterilization. In certain cases, supplementation with additional sources of nitrogen and or  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Sometimes enrichment of stillage with an easily metabolizable carbon source can improve growth and substrate utilization  Cabib et al. 1983; Wang et al. 1977 . The proportions of elements C:N:P of 50:5:1 were used in growing ﬁlamentous fungi in sugarcane stillage  Arau´jo et al. 1977; De Lamo and De Menezes 1978 , while 40:10:1 was optimal for A. fusidioides in the same substrate  Rosalem et al. 1985 . Cells from agar slants can be used directly as inocula for stillage fermentation, or the relevant microbes can be precultured under submerged conditions. The usual quantity of inoculum for inoculation is 10% of the microbial strain to the stillage may have a positive effect on bioconversion. Submerged aerobic processes are used with laboratory experiments carried out in shake ﬂasks and fermentors. In large-scale experiments culture volumes of 9 m3  Cabib et al. 1983  and even 80 m3  Wang et al. 1980  have been reported. Batch, fed batch, or continuous operation modes are employed in trial fermentation. In addition to single fungus inocula, mixed cultures of microorganisms or a two-stage cultivation with successive cultivation of two different microorganisms have been used. Cell recycling proved to be beneﬁcial for higher yields of biomass as well as for better consumption of organic substances  Staheeu et al. 1985; Wang et al. 1980 . Cultivation temperatures were kept between 22 and 388C, suitable for mesophilic microorgan- isms; pH control at the predetermined value often proved to be beneﬁcial to the microorganism. The fermentation broth required vigorous aeration to ensure good growth. Aeration values of 0.5 – 1.0 vvm generally were employed; exceptions being the very high aeration rates in small bioreactors or lower aeration rates of 1 vvh  Wang et al. 1980  in large scale experiments. Agitation rates range from 200 to 1000 rpm. In 21  Yang and continuous cultivation, dilution rates of 0.016 h 21  Wang et al. 1980  were employed. Tung 1996  to 0.383 h The dilution rate could be increased by the use of a cell- recycling technique  Wang et al. 1980 . In batch processes the fermentation time is dependent on the microorganism and ranged from several hours to 2 days with yeasts, to several days with molds, and up to 12 days with mushrooms. After fermentation the yeast biomass is generally harvested by centrifugation, whereas with ﬁlamentous fungi simple ﬁltration is possible.  5 PRODUCTS AND EFFECTS  Bioconversion of distillery waste by means of fungi brings a double beneﬁt: the efﬂuent is substantially puriﬁed and, in addition, it is possible to obtain useful products, such as protein-rich fungal biomass, ethanol, enzymes, etc. Results of bioconversion by yeasts are given in Table 2.  In most experiments C. utilis was used as the chosen microorganism, especially for cane molasses stillage  Friedrich et al. 1992 . The quantity of cells produced varied signiﬁcantly with the concentration of the substrate and with the addition of N sources. With increasing nitrogen   1980   supplementation a concentration of biomass of up to 25 g l could be obtained with C. utilis in cane molasses stillage  Cabib et al. 1983 . The high quantity of C. utilis biomass of 22 g l obtained by Wang et al. in continuous fermentation was a result of cell recycling. Crude protein content in the biomass of Candida utilis accounted for 28 – 58% of the cell mass. With the same species the maximal COD reduction in the efﬂuent was 52%  Nudel et al. 1987  and the highest BOD reduction was 55%  Matsuo et al. 1965 . Among yeasts shown in Table 2, other than C. utilis, outstanding biomass concentration of 70 g l was produced by S. cerevisiae during continuous cultivation in enriched rice spirit stillage  Yang and Tung 1996 . In general, concen- trations of about 20 g l were relatively high. The biomass of Candida brumptii showed the highest protein content of 53%. Kluyveromyces marxianus seemed to be outstandingly efﬁcient, considering the COD reduction of 60 – 70%, while its biomass concentration of 10 g l was low in comparison with C. utilis. The results of reduced COD and BOD are given in terms of relative values and the absolute reduction is dependent on the initial value.  Filamentous fungi are cultivated mostly in batch processes. Results of bioconversion of distillery waste by ﬁlamentous fungi are given in Table 3.  When compared with yeasts, ﬁlamentous fungi are more effective in consuming polluting substances, since COD and BOD reductions of over 80 and 90%, respectively, have been recorded. A. oryzae  Arau´jo et al. 1977  and G. deliquescens  Rolz et al. 1975  in sugarcane stillage, Penicillium strains in wine vinasse  Magny et al. 1977 , and G. candidum in malt whisky stillage  Quinn and Marchant 1980  proved to be the most promising in this respect. The highest amount of biomass was reached with A. awamori var. kawachi in rice- shochu distillery wastewater  Morimura et al. 1994a . It was observed that on average the protein content in the biomass of ﬁlamentous fungi was lower than that of yeasts. G. candidum, however, was found to produce the highest protein content; there was 45.5% “true” protein in the biomass as determined by the biuret method  Quinn and Marchant 1980 .  An overview of the bioconversion products and effects using mixed cultures of different microorganisms is given in Table 4.  In general, mixed cultures were the most effective in substrate utilization, based on COD values. A co-culture of 15 yeast strains in a high-loaded beet molasses stillage of initial 74.5 g l COD, produced the highest amount of biomass, 28.9 g l, in batch culture. When diluted medium was applied, the biomass yield was much lower  Huyard et al. 1986 . A successful approach seems to be a two-step separated cultivation of C. utilis and P. varioti by which a total amount of 22 g l cell material and a COD reduction of as much as 90% were obtained. During the ﬁrst step, C. utilis was used mainly for SCP production, whereas P. varioti in the second step consumed the reducing organic substances in the liquid phase  Azzam and Heikel 1989; Bottaro-Castilla et al. 1984 . Similar results were observed in a two-step continuous cultivation of C. utilis and A. niger grown separately  Nudel  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

In general, it was observed that the combination of yeast with ﬁlamentous fungi resulted in improvement of COD reduction, and improved wastewater puriﬁcation.  While the batch cultivation mode is most frequently used, continuous cultivation of fungi in stillages can have some advantages regarding the product yield  Table 5 .  As shown in Table 5, an outstanding biomass yield of 70 g l was produced by S. cerevisiae in enriched stillage from rice spirit distillation when the dilution rate was low  Yang and Tung 1996 . On the other hand, dilution rates of over 21 with cell recycling resulted in a productivity of over 0.36 h 4 g l h Candida biomass and a steady-state biomass concentration of 18 – 22 g l  Wang et al. 1980 . In continuous culture, COD was reduced most effectively by using K. marxianus  Braun and Meyrath 1981 . A serial culture of a yeast and a ﬁlamentous fungus in two steps gave the most promising results with respect to both biomass yield and efﬁcient consumption of organic matter  Bottaro Castilla et al. 1984; Nudel et al. 1987 . Two-step cultivation of G. candidum also seemed to be very suitable, with the steady-state biomass of 31 – 34 g l  Quinn and Marchant 1980 . The continuous cultivation process could lead to a in the biomass and enhance the higher protein content stability of resistance to contamination  Barker et al. 1982 .  the culture as well as  its  Microbial biomass rich in protein is the main product of fungal bioconversion of stillages. Some information is available about cell material composition. It appears that C. utilis biomass composition is similar to that of other yeasts grown in carbohydrate media. Microbial protein has a good balance of amino acids with the exception of those containing sulfur, such as cysteine and methionine; the content of the latter amino acids is generally low in microbial biomass  Cabib et al. 1983; Quinn and Marchant 1979b; Yaziciog˘lu et al. 1980 . However, lysine is in excess when compared to the recommended level of the FAO standards  Quinn and Marchant 1979b . Yeast biomass from vinasse is rich in nitrogen, vitamins, and other biologically active substances. The vitamin B complex of yeast is very efﬁcient and could not be adequately substituted by a mixture of analytically pure vitamins  Cabib et al. 1983; Yaziciog˘lu et al. 1980 .  Nutritional evaluation of yeast biomass grown in malt whisky distillery slop showed that it was suitable for nonruminants with a net protein utilization value of 0.40, and a digestibility of 0.67. The biomass was not toxic, as conﬁrmed by toxicological tests  Barker et al. 1982 . When molasses stillages were used, K and Mg contents could have laxative effects  Arau´jo et al. 1977 . The nucleic acid content in cell material should be as low as possible; ﬁlamentous fungi have an advantage over yeasts in this respect  Arau´jo et al. 1977 . It has been observed that levels of DNA and RNA were lower in batch than in continuous cultures  Quinn and Marchant 1979b . Feeding experiments of Aspergillus biomass in a diet for chicks, demonstrated excellent  acceptability, good weight gain, and no toxicity; the biomass had a very good protein efﬁciency ratio, being comparable to meat and soya meal  Arau´jo et al. 1977 . A 1% methionine addition to Candida yeast biomass increased the biological value, which was not much lower than that of casein  Cabib et al. 1983 .  With the use of fungi for bioconversion of distillery wastewaters, not only fungal biomass but also other products can be obtained. Secondary ethanol can be produced by the original yeast used in a primary alcohol fermentation, if the distillation is performed at low temperatures in vacuum  Teramoto et al. 1993; Ueda and Teramoto 1995; Ueda et al. 1991 . Microbial polysaccharides can be produced, such as pullulan with Aureobasidium sp.  Leathers and Gupta 1994  or chitosan with A. atrospora or G. butleri strains  Yokoi et al. 1998 . Hydrolytic enzymes can be produced by ﬁlamentous fungi. Cellulases and other glucosidases can be products of bioconversion when cellulolytic fungi are grown in fruit distillery slops  Friedrich et al. 1986; 1987; Gunde-Cimerman et al. 1986 . Some ascomycetes, especially A. awamori var. kawachi, are able to produce starch saccharifying enzymes from shochu distillery wastewater  Morimura et al. 1991; 1992 . Acid proteases are produced mainly with Aspergillus species in rice  Morimura et al. 1994a; Yang and Lin 1998  and barley  Morimura et al. 1994a  shochu stillages. Possible products are a yeast pigment, astaxanthin, from P. rhodozyma  Fontana et al. 1997  and plant growth hormones, obtained by growing white rot fungi, such as F. trogii or T. versicolor  Yu¨rekli et al. 1999 .  6 ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS  Little information is available concerning the economics of the bioconversion process. Only rough estimates of costs were given by Maiorella et al.  1983  and Tomlinson  1976b . The main costs are high capital investment  Tomlinson 1976b , energy needed for aeration, agitation and cooling  Maiorella et al. 1983 , biomass separation  Tomlinson 1976b , nutrient supplementation, sterility problems, limited production, and irregularities in raw material composition. However, capital cost may not be too high, as was shown in the cost evaluation for molasses stillage treatment methods, where aerobic yeast growth was estimated to require the lowest capital investment  Maiorella et al. 1983 . Separation of cell materials from the broth would be easy with the application of ﬁlamentous fungi. The addition of nutrients is not always required. Sterility problems could be managed or at reduced by maintaining a low pH  Cabib et al. 1983; Huyard et al. 1986; Matsuo et al. 1966 , and the use of mixed cultures  Barker et al. 1982 . The problem with large-scale plants is the need for a continuous and relatively homogeneous supply of stillage. Comparison of cost with that for conventional biological treatment has shown that annual savings could be increased by applying fungal bioconversion of stillages  Tomlinson 1976b . Similarly, rough estimates of capital and operating costs for molasses stillage treatment by fungi show  least  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   that savings could be gained, even though wastewater would still have to be puriﬁed. Comparison of different treatment methods for molasses stillage showed that aerobic Candida yeast growth was the most suitable option. The same method was proposed for sulﬁte waste liquor and wood hydrolysis stillages  Maiorella et al. 1983 .  7 CONCLUSIONS  The use of fungi for bioconversion of distillery waste into microbial biomass or some useful metabolites is reviewed. Stillages remaining in alcohol distilleries, although based on different raw materials have the common characteristic in that they are highly loaded efﬂuents, which are difﬁcult to purify. They are harmful to the environment due to the high content of organic substances and low pH. However, these properties facilitate their use as substrates for fungal growth. Sugarcane molasses stillages have been used for the most part. Among fungi, yeasts, especially C. utilis, predominate. To a minor extent ﬁlamentous fungi, including Basidiomycetes, as well as mixed fungal or mixed fungal and bacterial cultures have been used. Laboratory, pilot scale, and industrial scale experiments have been performed, and batch or continuous, single- or two-step fermentations have been introduced. The end products of bioconversion are fungal biomass and substantially puriﬁed and decolorized efﬂuents. A well- balanced amino acid composition makes the biomass suitable as an animal feed supplement. In addition to biomass other products can be obtained, such as ethanol, enzymes, polysaccharides, pigments, and plant growth hormones. The economics of stillage bioconversion with fungi is dependent on many different factors and can vary from country to country. However, the conclusion is that fungi have a great potential in helping to solve pollution problems and, at the same time, producing marketable products.

Sutherland National Center for Toxicological Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Jefferson, Arkansas, USA  1  INTRODUCTION  Hydrocarbons are ubiquitous in the environment, but they are most abundant where coal and petroleum fuels are stored, processed, or burned  Tuha´cˇkova´ et al. 2001; Warshawsky 1999 . Because many hydrocarbons are toxic, their biological effects have been studied extensively. Occupational exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  PAHs  in the aluminum, coke, and steel industries has been linked to lung and bladder cancer  Mastrangelo et al. 1996  and exposure to hydrocarbon fuels may produce neurotoxic effects  Ritchie et al. 2001 . Mammalian metabolites of benzo[a]pyrene, the most important carcinogen in natural PAH mixtures, form adducts with macromolecules and interfere with cellular signaling pathways  Miller and Ramos 2001 . Some PAHs are either weakly estrogenic or antiestrogenic  Santodonato 1997 . The widespread ability of yeasts and ﬁlamentous fungi to transform hydrocarbons suggests that they may be involved in the recycling of naturally occurring hydrocarbons in the environment as well as in the biodeterioration of liquid fuels  Lindley 1992 . Their versatility in degrading hydrocarbons is due to the broad substrate speciﬁcity of their enzymes  Cerniglia and Sutherland 2001 . Selected fungi are now being exploited for the bioremediation of soils contaminated with hydrocarbon wastes  Atlas and Cerniglia 1995; Cerniglia and Sutherland 2001  and other species are used for the biotransformation of hydrocarbons to higher-value compounds  Trudgill 1994 .  The recycling of hydrocarbons by fungi  is probably common, though usually unnoticed, in the environment. For instance, certain yeasts can utilize the methane produced in lakes  Wolf and Hanson 1979; 1980 . Fungi that are pathogenic to insects can degrade the hydrocarbons found in the epicuticular waxes of their hosts  Crespo et al. 2000;  Napolitano and Jua´rez 1997 . Many ﬁlamentous fungi and yeasts grow abundantly in soils contaminated by petroleum residues  April et al. 1998; 2000; Ekundayo and Obuekwe 2000 . Fungi also degrade hydrocarbons in streams and lakes  Grifﬁn and Cooney 1979; Romero et al. 2001  and in oil- polluted seawater  Cerniglia 1997; Zinjarde et al. 1998 . Filamentous fungi, especially Hormoconis resinae [the anamorph of Amorphotheca resinae], may contaminate aviation fuels when water is present  Parbery 1971 . Yeasts are responsible for biodeterioration of liquid fuels at the interface with water and mycelial fungi may physically block the fuel lines of ships and aircraft  Lindley 1992 . The ability of fungi to metabolize hydrocarbons is now being exploited to clean up the environment. Several fungi are used to remove PAHs from wastewater  Giraud et al. 2001; Liao et al. 1997  and yeasts are used to decompose petroleum residues in estuaries  Nwachukwu 2000 . Fungi have been used to inoculate contaminated soils to degrade hydrocarbons  May et al. 1997; Novotny et al. 1999; Rama et al. 2000 . Cultures that grow on toluene, ethylbenzene, and styrene can be used in bioﬁlters to remove these compounds from industrial waste gases  Cox et al. 1996; Garcı´a-Pen˜a et al. 2001; Prenafeta- Boldu´ et al. 2001 .  Many puriﬁed hydrocarbons can be transformed stereo- speciﬁcally by fungi to produce higher-value products. The monoterpenes a- and b-pinene  Prema and Bhattacharyya 1962 , b-myrcene  Yamazaki et al. 1988 , and limonene  Noma et al. 1992; de Oliveira and Strapasson 2000  as well as several sesquiterpenes  Abraham et al. 1992; Miyazawa et al. 1995; 1997; 1998  are transformed to chiral metabolites.   þ  -Limonene can be transformed to perillyl alcohol, an  anticancer drug  de Oliveira and Strapasson 2000 . Ethyl- benzene and propylbenzene are transformed stereospeciﬁ-  cally to  þ  -1-phenylethanol and  þ  -1-phenylpropanol,  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   which may be used as chiral building blocks for chemical synthesis  Uzura et al. 2001 . Some species of fungi are more abundant in sites with hydrocarbon deposition  Tuha´cˇkova´ et al. 2001 . The fungal genera that have been studied most extensively for use in the biotransformation of hydrocarbons are the white-rot basidiomycetes Phanerochaete, Pleurotus, and Trametes, the zygomycete Cunninghamella, the hypho- mycetes Aspergillus and Penicillium, and the yeast Candida. Several of these fungi have been used in the experimental bioremediation of soils contaminated with oil  Atlas and Cerniglia 1995; Colombo et al. 1996 . Phanerochaete chrysosporium causes a white rot of wood by degrading lignin  Hammel 1995 . It oxidizes PAHs to trans-dihydro- diols, phenols, quinones, glucoside conjugates, aromatic acids, and eventually CO2  Bumpus 1989; Cerniglia and Sutherland 2001; Sutherland et al. 1991 . Several enzymes are responsible, including lignin peroxidase, manganese per- oxidase, and cytochrome P450  Bogan et al. 1996; Cerniglia and Sutherland 2001; Hammel et al. 1991; 1992 . P. chrysosporium also cometabolizes single-ring aromatic compounds, such as benzene and toluene, to CO2  Yadav and Reddy 1993 . P. laevis, another species which oxidizes PAHs to polar metabolites  Bogan and Lamar 1996 , produces manganese peroxidase and a small amount of laccase but not lignin peroxidase.  Pleurotus ostreatus, the cultivated oyster mushroom, is another white-rot fungus with the ability to mineralize PAHs to CO2  Bezalel et al. 1996a; Wolter et al. 1997 . Other metabolites include trans-dihydrodiols, quinones, and aro- matic acids  Bezalel et al. 1996b . Evidence supports the involvement of a cytochrome P450 and an epoxide hydrolase in the early steps of PAH metabolism; manganese peroxidase and laccase may be involved in the later steps  Bezalel et al. 1996b; Schu¨tzendu¨bel et al. 1999 . P. pulmonarius, a related species, produces a cytochrome P450 that hydroxylates benzo[a]pyrene  Masaphy et al. 1999 . Trametes versicolor, another basidiomycete that causes a white rot of wood, also degrades PAHs in soil  Rama et al. 2000 . It produces a manganese peroxidase that oxidizes ﬂuorene and phenan- threne  Collins and Dobson 1996 . T. versicolor also produces laccases, which can oxidize anthracene and benzo[a]pyrene in the presence of chemical mediators  Collins et al. 1996; Johannes and Majcherczyk 2000 . A second species, T. hirsuta, produces a laccase that has been shown to oxidize phenanthrene in the presence of linoleic acid and the mediator 1-hydroxybenzotriazole  Bo¨hmer et al. 1998 . Cunning- hamella elegans, a zygomycete, oxidizes biphenyl and a large variety of PAHs to metabolites with higher water solubility  Cerniglia 1992; 1993; 1997; Dodge et al. 1979; Cerniglia et al. 1992; Sutherland 1992; Pothuluri and Cerniglia 1994; Cerniglia and Sutherland 2001 . C. elegans ﬁrst oxidizes a PAH to an arene oxide by a cytochrome P450 monooxygen- ase reaction  Cerniglia 1992; 1997 . It then quickly hydrates the arene oxide, forming a trans-dihydrodiol, by an epoxide hydrolase reaction  Sutherland et al. 1995 . Alternatively, the arene oxide may rearrange nonenzymatically to form a phenol. The trans-dihydrodiols and phenols may be  conjugated later with sulfate or glucoside  Casillas et al. 1996; Pothuluri et al. 1990; 1996 . Another species, C. blakesleeana, oxidizes cyclohexylcyclohexane  Davies et al. 1986 .  Aspergillus niger and A.  fumigatus both metabolize terpenes and PAHs. A. niger converts the terpene b-myrcene to dihydroxylated derivatives  Yamazaki et al. 1988 . Another strain of this species oxidizes the PAHs phenanthrene and pyrene to phenols and methyl ethers  Sack et al. 1997a , and there is even a report of the ability of A. niger to cleave the rings of naphthalene, anthracene, and phenanthrene cellulosae  Yogambal [A. hydroxylation, double-bond reduction, and ketone formation  Noma et al. 1992 . A. fumigatus also produces a cytochrome P450 that hydroxylates benzo[a]pyrene  Venkateswarlu et al. 1996 . Penicillium glabrum oxidizes pyrene to mono- and dihydroxylated derivatives, quinones, methyl ethers, and a sulfate  Wunder et al. 1997 . P. digitatum hydrates one of the  transforms  þ  - and  2  -limonene by  double bonds in  þ  -limonene to form  þ  -a-terpineol  and Karegoudar  1997 . A.  fumigatus]   Demyttenaere et al. 2001; Tan et al. 1998  and a different Penicillium sp. strain transforms a-pinene to verbenone  Agrawal and Joseph 2000 . P. janthinellum oxidizes high- molecular-weight PAHs to phenols and quinones  Boonchan et al. 2000; Launen et al. 2000 . Candida maltosa, a yeast that grows on n-alkanes, and some other Candida spp. produce cytochrome P450 monooxygenases that hydroxylate n-hexadecane and n-octadecane  Scheller et al. 1996 . Alkane-utilizing Candida sp. strains from oil-polluted soils may produce biosurfactants as well as oxidative enzymes  Ekundayo and Obuekwe 2000 . A strain of C. utilis that utilizes n-alkanes has been used for the bioremediation of mangrove sites  Nwachukwu 2000 . Among the hydrocarbons that can be transformed by fungi are alkanes  Lindley 1992; Morgan and Watkinson 1994 , terpenes  Trudgill 1994 , monocyclic aromatic compounds  Prenafeta-Boldu´ et al. 2001; Yadav and Reddy 1993 , and PAHs  Cerniglia 1992; 1993; 1997; Cerniglia and Sutherland 2001; Cerniglia et al. 1992; Juhasz and Naidu 2000; Hammel 1995; Mu¨ncnerova´ and Augustin 1994; Pothuluri and Cerniglia 1994; Sutherland 1992; Sutherland et al. 1995 . This chapter will emphasize the recent research on hydrocarbon transformation by fungi.  2 ALKANES AND ALKENES  Many soil fungi, such as Aspergillus terreus, Pseudal- lescheria boydii, and the yeast Candida tropicalis, degrade the mixtures of n-alkanes found in crude oil  April et al. 1998; 2000; Colombo et al. 1996; Nwachukwu 2000 , often with the help of biosurfactants  Lindley 1992 . Candida utilis has also been used for the bioremediation of n-alkanes in aquatic ecosystems  Nwachukwu 2000 .  Methane, the major component of natural gas, is produced by a variety of methanogenic Archaea. It is utilized for growth by methanotrophic yeasts  Wolf and Hanson 1979; 1980  that  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   lack the ability to grow on methanol, formaldehyde, or formate. Ethane, propane, and n-butane, which are also found in natural gas, are oxidized by Acremonium sp. and some other fungi to alcohols that can be utilized for growth  Davies et al. 1976 .  in C.  Straight-chain alkanes, from n-decane to n-octadecane, are utilized for growth by several yeasts  Ekundayo and Obuekwe 2000; Iida et al. 2000 . They are hydroxylated by inducible tropicalis, cytochrome P450 monooxygenases C. maltosa, and C. apicola  Scheller et al. 1996  and Yarrowia lipolytica  Iida et al. 2000 . Several genes encoding cytochromes P450 have been identiﬁed in the alkane- metabolizing yeasts  van den Brink et al. 1998; Iida et al. 2000 . n-Hexadecane induces conversion of the mycelial form of Y. lipolytica to the yeast form  Zinjarde et al. 1998 . Cladosporium resinae [H. resinae], a ﬁlamentous fungus which grows on n-alkanes, produces an NADH-dependent alkane monooxygenase located in the cytosol  Goswami and Cooney 1999 . The insect pathogens Metarhizium anisopliae and Beauveria bassiana grow on n-hexadecane, n-tetracosane, n-pentacosane, and n-octacosane, apparently by b-oxidation  Napolitano and Jua´rez 1997; Crespo et al. 2000 .  The branched alkanes pristane  2,6,10,14-tetramethyl- pentadecane  and phytane  3,7,11,15-tetramethylhexadecane  are usually considered recalcitrant to microbial attack but can be degraded by several fungi, including P. boydii  April et al. 1998; Grifﬁn and Cooney 1979 . 3,11-Dimethylnonacosane, another branched alkane, is degraded to shorter-chain hydrocarbons by M. anisopliae  Napolitano and Jua´rez 1997 .  Cyclohexane, which occurs in petroleum and is used as a solvent, is transformed cometabolically by several fungi  Grifﬁn and Cooney 1979 . A Cladophialophora sp. has been  found to make limited growth on cyclohexane  Prenafeta- Boldu´ et al. 2001 . The synthetic compound cyclohexyl- cyclohexane is cometabolized to a diol by B. bassiana, Cunninghamella blakesleeana, and Gongronella lacrispora  Davies et al. 1986 .  Alkenes, produced during the cracking of petroleum and natural gas, have seldom been investigated as possible substrates for fungal degradation. Hexadec-1-ene and heptadec-1-ene are oxidized by Candida lipolytica [Y. lipolytica] via three different pathways  Figure 1  to epoxides, alcohols, diols, and carboxylic acids  Klug and Markovetz 1968 . 1,13-Tetradecadiene is utilized for growth by unidentiﬁed fungi  Grifﬁn and Cooney 1979 . Cyclo- hexene is transformed via 2-cyclohexenol to 2-cyclohexenone and 1-methylcyclohexene is transformed via 3-methyl-2- cyclohexenol to 3-methyl-2-cyclohexenone by Aspergillus cellulosae [A. fumigatus]  Noma et al. 1992 .  3 TERPENES  Terpene hydrocarbons  Figure 2  are plant products, synthesized from isoprene units, that are found in the essential oils of plants  Trudgill 1994 . Several mono- terpenes, sesquiterpenes, and triterpenes are transformed stereoselectively by fungi.   þ  -a-Pinene from oil of turpentine is transformed by A. niger to  þ  -verbenone,  þ  -cis-verbenol, and  þ  -trans- mellea to  þ  -trans-sobrerol,  þ  -trans-verbenol, and  þ  -verbenone plus seven minor metabolites  Draczyn´ska  sobrerol  Prema and Bhattacharyya 1962 ; by Armillariella  et al. 1985 ; and by Penicillium sp. to verbenone  Agrawal and Joseph 2000 .  2  -a-Pinene is converted by A. mellea  Figure 1 Pathways for the oxidation of 1-alkenes by the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica  adapted from Klug and Markovetz 1968 .

The triterpene squalene  Figure 2  and steroid hydro- carbons, such as stigmasta-3,5-diene, are among the lipophilic extractives in eucalyptus wood that have been found to be partially degraded by Phlebia radiata and other white-rot fungi  Martı´nez-I´n˜igo et al. 2000 .  4 MONOCYCLIC AROMATIC  HYDROCARBONS  The BTEX compounds  benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and the xylene isomers  are toxic components of liquid fuels  Ritchie et al. 2001 . They are also commonly used in industry as solvents and chemical feedstocks. Toluene and ethyl- benzene support the growth of a few fungi, which have consequently been used for the bioremediation of the volatile components of toxic wastes  Prenafeta-Boldu´ et al. 2001 . Benzene and xylenes do not appear to serve as carbon or energy sources for fungi, although there are reports of the fungal cometabolism of benzene to phenol  Grifﬁn and Cooney 1979  and even of its mineralization to CO2  Yadav and Reddy 1993 .  Toluene is utilized as a carbon and energy source by Cladosporium sphaerospermum, Scedosporium apiospermum [the anamorph of P. boydii ], Cladophialophora sp., Exophiala sp., and Pseudeurotium zonatum; these fungi may be used in bioﬁlters to clean up toluene in waste gases  Garcia-Pen˜a et al. 2001; Prenafeta-Boldu´ et al. 2001; Weber et al. 1995 . In high-nitrogen media, P. chrysosporium cometabolizes toluene to CO2  Yadav and Reddy 1993 .

Fusarium moniliforme [F. verticillioides] oxidizes ethylbenzene and  propylbenzene to  þ  -1-phenylethanol and  þ  -1-phenyl-  propanol, respectively  Uzura et al. 2001 .  The o-, m-, and p-isomers of xylene are all cometabolized by P. chrysosporium but the products are unknown  Yadav and Reddy 1993 . Several other dialkylbenzenes, such as 1,4-di-tert-butylbenzene, are hydroxylated on the methyl  groups by Sporotrichum sulfurescens [B. bassiana]  Johnson et al. 1973 .  Styrene  C6H5CHvCH2  serves as a growth substrate for Exophiala jeanselmei, C. sphaerospermum, and Cladophialophora sp.  Cox et al. 1996; Prenafeta-Boldu´ et al. 2001 . is oxidized by a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase to styrene oxide, which is converted to phenylacetaldehyde and phenylacetic acid  Cox et al. 1996 . P. ostreatus oxidizes styrene to  jeanselmei,  In E.  it  Figure 3 Structures of several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

Several yeasts cometabolize biphenyl to 4-hydroxybiphenyl, which Debaryomyces vanrijiae, Rhodo- torula glutinis, and Y. lipolytica convert further to 4-phenyl-2- pyrone-6-carboxylic acid  Lange et al. 1998; Romero et al. 2001 . The yeast Trichosporon mucoides cometabolizes biphenyl to 2-, 3-, and 4-hydroxybiphenyl, eight dihydroxy- lated biphenyls, three trihydroxylated biphenyls, and a quinone  Sietmann et al. 2000; Sietmann et al. 2001 . It further transforms the di- and trihydroxylated biphenyls to eight different ring-cleavage products  Sietmann et al. 2001 .  6 POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC  HYDROCARBONS  fungi  The ﬁrst step in the biotransformation of PAHs  Figure 3  by most is initiated by a cytochrome P450 mono- oxygenase; white-rot basidiomycetes may also employ lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase, or laccase  Hammel 1995; Cerniglia 1997; Cerniglia and Sutherland 2001; Sutherland et al. 1995 . Later steps may involve conjugation to form sulfates, glucosides, glucuronides, or xylosides  Casillas et al. 1996 . Although PAHs do not generally serve as growth substrates for fungi, the yeast R. glutinis is reported to utilize phenanthrene for growth  Romero et al. 1998 . The ability of fungi to transform PAHs has been exploited for the bioremediation of contaminated soil  Juhasz and Naidu 2000; Cerniglia and Sutherland 2001 .  Naphthalene is oxidized by C. elegans to 1- and 2-naphthol, naphthalene trans-1,2-dihydrodiol, 4-hydroxy-1- tetralone, the 1,2- and 1,4-naphthoquinones, and sulfate and glucuronide conjugates  Cerniglia and Gibson 1977; Cerniglia 1992 . Both constitutive and inducible hydroxylases appear to be involved in the pathway  Faber et al. 2001 . A. niger has been reported  Yogambal and Karegoudar 1997  to metabolize naphthalene via gentisate, a naphthalene metabolite produced by some bacteria. Naphthalene is removed from wastewater by the immobilized mycelia of P. chrysosporium  Liao et al. 1997 .  Acenaphthene is oxidized by C. elegans to 6-hydro- xyacenaphthenone, 1,2-acenaphthenedione, acenaphthene trans-1,2-dihydrodiol, and four minor metabolites  Pothuluri et al. 1992 . The laccase of Coriolopsis gallica oxidizes acenaphthene and biphenylene in the presence of an artiﬁcial 0 -azinobis- 3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6- mediator compound, 2,2 sulfonate   ABTS   Pickard et al. 1999 , and the laccase of T. versicolor oxidizes acenaphthene and acenaphthylene in the presence of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid  Johannes and Majcherczyk 2000 .  Fluorene is oxidized by C. elegans to 9-hydroxyﬂuorene, 9-ﬂuorenone, and 2-hydroxy-9-ﬂuorenone  Pothuluri et al. 1993 . The ﬁrst two are also produced by P. chrysosporium, P. ostreatus, and other fungi  Bezalel et al. 1996c; Bogan et al. 1996; Bumpus 1989; Garon et al. 2000; Schu¨tzendu¨bel et al. 1999 . The oxidation of ﬂuorene to 9-ﬂuorenone requires manganese peroxidase activity in P. chrysosporium and T. versicolor  Bogan et al. 1996; Collins and Dobson 1996  but not in P. ostreatus or Bjerkandera adusta  Schu¨tzendu¨bel et al. 1999 . The laccases of C. gallica and T. versicolor are also able to oxidize ﬂuorene  Bressler et al. 2000; Johannes and Majcherczyk 2000 .  Anthracene is transformed by C. elegans to a trans-1,2- dihydrodiol and 1-anthryl sulfate  Cerniglia and Yang 1984 ; 9,10-anthraquinone has also been reported  Lisowska and  Dlugonski 1999 . Rhizoctonia solani produces the  þ   and  2   trans-1,2-dihydrodiols and three xyloside conjugates  Sutherland et al. 1992 . Absidia cylindrospora, Rhizopus arrhizus, Ulocladium chartarum, A. niger, Cryphonectria parasitica, and several white-rot fungi also transform anthracene  Field et al. 1996; Giraud et al. 2001; Gramss et al. 1999; Krivobok et al. 1998; Schu¨tzendu¨bel et al. 1999; Yogambal and Karegoudar 1997 . P. chrysosporium degrades anthracene via anthraquinone and phthalate to CO2, presumably with the involvement of lignin peroxidase  Hammel et al. 1991 . P. ostreatus produces anthraquinone and anthracene trans-1,2-dihydrodiol  Andersson and Henrysson 1996; Bezalel et al. 1996c; Novotny et al. 1999; Schu¨tzendu¨bel et al. 1999 ; incorporates the products into humus  Bogan et al. 1999  or degrades them to CO2  Ma´rquez-Rocha et al. 2000 . Pleurotus sajor-caju [P. pulmonarius], T. versicolor, and other fungi also produce anthraquinone  Andersson and Henrysson 1996 . Phanero- chaete laevis produces manganese peroxidase and degrades anthracene without accumulating anthraquinone  Bogan and Lamar 1996 . The laccases of C. gallica and T. versicolor oxidize anthracene to anthraquinone  Collins et al. 1996; Johannes and Majcherczyk 2000; Pickard et al. 1999 ; that of Nematoloma frowardii, in the presence of glutathione, can mineralize it  Sack et al. 1997b .  in soil,  it  Phenanthrene is oxidized by C. elegans, Syncephalastrum racemosum, and A. niger to trans-dihydrodiols, phenanthrols, and sulfate conjugates  Cerniglia and Yang 1984; Casillas et al. 1996; Sutherland et al. 1993 . Glucoside and glucuronide conjugates may also be produced  Casillas et al. 1996 . A. niger is reported to produce 1-methoxy- phenanthrene  Sack et al. 1997a  as well as a ring-cleavage product, protocatechuate  Yogambal and Karegoudar 1997 . P. chrysosporium degrades phenanthrene  Bumpus 1989 , producing trans-9,10- and 3,4-dihydrodiols, 9-, 3-, and 4-phenanthrols, and a glucoside in high-nitrogen media  Sutherland et al. 1991; Sutherland et al. 1993  and -diphenic acid in low- phenanthrene-9,10-quinone and 2,2 nitrogen media  Hammel et al. 1992 . P. ostreatus also degrades phenanthrene  Bezalel et al. 1996a; Ma´rquez-Rocha et al. 2000; Schu¨tzendu¨bel et al. 1999 , producing the trans-9,10-dihydrodiol and 2,2 -diphenic acid  Bezalel et al.  0  0  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

Several other fungi, including white-rot and ectomycorrhizal fungi, degrade phenanthrene  Colombo et al. 1996; Braun- Lu¨llemann et al. 1999; Gramss et al. 1999; Field et al. 1996; Lisowska and Długon´ski 1999; Schu¨tzendu¨bel et al. 1999 . The manganese peroxidases of P. laevis  Bogan and Lamar 1996 , T. versicolor  Collins and Dobson 1996; Rama et al. frowardii  Sack et al. 1997b  all oxidize 2000 , and N. phenanthrene. The laccase of Trametes hirsuta, in the presence of the mediator 1-hydroxybenzotriazole and linoleic 0 -diphenic acid, oxidizes phenanthrene via the quinone to 2,2 acid  Bo¨hmer et al. 1998 ; that of C. gallica, in the presence of ABTS, also oxidizes it  Pickard et al. 1999 . Unlike other the yeast R. glutinis has been reported to utilize fungi, phenanthrene as a sole carbon and energy source  Romero et al. 1998 .  Fluoranthene is metabolized by C. elegans to a trans-2,3- the 8- and 9-hydroxyﬂuoranthene trans-2,3- dihydrodiol, dihydrodiols, and two glucoside conjugates  Pothuluri et al. 1990 . A. cylindrospora, A. niger, U. chartarum, the yeast Cryptococcus albidus, and the white-rot fungi P. chrysosporium, P. ostreatus, and B. adusta also degrade ﬂuoranthene  Liao et al. 1997; Giraud et al. 2001; Gramss et al. 1999; Salicis et al. 1999; Schu¨tzendu¨bel et al. 1999 . P. ostreatus binds ﬂuoranthene metabolites to humus in soil  Bogan et al. 1999 .  Pyrene is metabolized to 1-hydroxypyrene, 1,6- and 1,8-pyrenequinones, and three glucoside conjugates by C. elegans  Cerniglia et al. 1986 . A. niger produces 1-methoxypyrene and 1-hydroxypyrene  Sack et al. 1997a  and P. glabrum produces these two products plus 1-pyrenyl sulfate, 1,6-dimethoxypyrene, 1,6- and 1,8-dihydroxypyrene, and both quinones  Wunder et al. 1997 . Penicillium janthinellum and other fungi found in sediments also degrade pyrene  Launen et al. 2000; Ravelet et al. 2000 . P. ostreatus hydroxylates pyrene to the trans-4,5-dihydrodiol and partially mineralizes it  Bezalel et al. 1996a; Bezalel et al. 1996c; Wolter et al. 1997 , even in soil  Novotny et al. 1999; Ma´rquez-Rocha et al. 2000 . Crinipellis sp., Marasmius sp., and Marasmiellus sp. metabolize it to 1-hydroxy- pyrene, 1,6- and 1,8-dihydroxypyrene, both quinones, pyrene trans-4,5-dihydrodiol, and three sulfate conjugates  Lange et al. 1996 . Several other wood-decay and fungi mineralize pyrene  Braun-Lu¨llemann mycorrhizal et al. 1999; Field et al. 1996; Gramss et al. 1999; in der Wiesche et al. 1996; Schu¨tzendu¨bel et al. 1999; Song 1999 , as does the manganese peroxidase of N. frowardii in the presence of glutathione  Sack et al. 1997b .  Benz[a]anthracene, a carcinogen,  is hydroxylated by C. elegans to the trans-8,9-,10,11-, and 3,4-dihydrodiols and the 8,9,10,11-tetraol  Cerniglia et al. 1994 . P. janthinellum and the white-rot fungi P. chrysosporium, P. ostreatus, P. sajor-caju [P. pulmonarius], and T. versicolor also degrade it  Andersson and Henrysson 1996; Wolter et al. 1997; Boonchan et al. 2000 .

Benzo[b]ﬂuoranthene and benzo[k]ﬂuoranthene, which are both carcinogenic, are degraded in soil extracts by Bjerkandera sp.  Field et al. 1996  and in wheat straw by P. ostreatus  Wolter et al. 1997 .  Benzo[a]pyrene, a potent carcinogen, is oxidized by a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase in C. elegans, which transforms it to at least 13 compounds  Figure 4   Cerniglia and Gibson 1979; Cerniglia 1997 . The cytochromes P450 of Aspergillus fumigatus and other fungi also hydroxylate it  Juhasz and Naidu 2000; Venkateswarlu et al. 1996 . Several white-rot and ectomycorrhizal fungi degrade benzo[a]pyrene  Bezalel et al. 1996a; Bumpus 1989; Braun-Lu¨llemann et al. 1999; Kotterman et al. 1998; Ma´rquez-Rocha et al. 2000; Rama et al. 2000; Wolter et al. 1997; Wunch et al. 1999 . P. chrysosporium has been used to remove it from water  Liao et al. 1997 , and both P. chrysosporium and P. ostreatus form quinones that can be polymerized in soil  Bogan et al. 1999; May et al. 1997 . P. laevis produces manganese peroxidase and transforms benzo[a]pyrene to polar products  Bogan and Lamar 1996 ; the manganese peroxidase of N. frowardii can mineralize it in the presence of glutathione  Sack et al. 1997b . The laccases of T. versicolor, Pycnoporus cinnabarinus, and C. gallica oxidize benzo[a]- pyrene to quinones in the presence of ABTS  Collins et al. 1996; Pickard et al. 1999; Rama et al. 1998 .

Indeno[1,2,3-cd ] pyrene, which is also considered carcinogenic, is metabolized by Bjerkandera sp. in solvent extracts of contaminated soil  Field et al. 1996 . The methylated PAHs, many of which are carcinogenic, can be oxidized to a variety of metabolites. Methylnaphthalenes, methylanthracenes, methyl- and dimethylbenz[a]anthracenes, and 3-methylcholanthrene are transformed by C. elegans  Cerniglia et al. 1982a; 1982b; 1983; 1984; 1990; Wong et al. 1983 .

Pyrene mineralization by Dichomitus squalens and Pleurotus sp. was  enhanced by soil microorganisms  in der Wiesche et al. 1996 . The mineralization of benzo[a]pyrene by Bjerkandera sp. more than doubled after the addition of activated sludge  Kotterman et al. 1998 .

Figure 4 Benzo[a]pyrene and the metabolites that have been identiﬁed in cultures of Cunninghamella elegans  adapted from Cerniglia and Gibson 1979; Cerniglia et al. 1992; Cerniglia 1997 . The absolute stereochemistry of some of the compounds and the structures of the glucuronide and sulfate conjugates are not known.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

At one time, most of the industrial research on hydrocarbon metabolism consisted of attempts to produce yeast single-cell protein from petroleum, which was cheap and widely considered to be surplus  Lindley 1992 . Little of that type of research is being done now, but there has been extensive progress on the biotransformation of the production of ﬂavors, fragrances, and drug intermediates  Trudgill 1994  and on the degradation of PAHs and other toxic hydrocarbons during the bioremediation of soils  Atlas and Cerniglia 1995 .  terpenes for  Many of  the hydrocarbons contaminating soils and groundwater near leaking fuel tanks, oil spills, and chemical waste dumps can be degraded by fungi  Atlas and Cerniglia 1995; Cerniglia and Sutherland 2001; Colombo et al. 1996 . Most of the recent work in this ﬁeld has been done on PAHs, but some of it has been on BTEX compounds  Yadav and Reddy 1993  and on alkanes  Nwachukwu 2000 . Although gigantic oil spills from marine supertankers and offshore oil wells attract immediate public concern, smaller spills from fuel storage tanks are numerous and usually more amenable to bioremediation  Atlas and Cerniglia 1995 . The fungal bioremediation of contaminated soils may be accomplished either by removing soil for off-site treatment  May et al. 1997  or by using organic solvents to extract hydrocarbons from the soil for later degradation  Field et al. 1996 . On-site bioremediation may be done with fungi that can grow through the soil mass to reach the PAHs  Cerniglia 1997; Novotny et al. 1999 . Since few soil microorganisms have the ability to degrade high-molecular-weight PAHs alone  Juhasz and Naidu 2000 , fungi and bacteria are now being added together to achieve bioremediation  Boonchan et al. 2000 . Fungi have also been used to remove PAHs from wastewater  Liao et al. 1997  and bioﬁlters containing selected fungi have been used to remove toluene and other hydrocarbons from waste gases  Garcı´a-Pen˜a et al. 2001 .  Another application of  fungal biotechnology is the transformation of renewable resources, such as the terpenes a-pinene, b-pinene, and limonene, to valuable metabolites that are in demand by the ﬂavor and fragrance industries  Prema and Bhattacharyya 1962; Tan et al. 1998; van Dyk et al. 1998 . Fungi usually transform monoterpenes to  hydroxylated derivatives and ketones. For instance,  þ  - limonene may be hydrated to  þ  -a-terpineol, a widely  used fragrance chemical  Demyttenaere et al. 2001; Tan et al. 1998 , or oxidized to perillyl alcohol, which not only inhibits the growth of some tumor cells but also is a precursor of the artiﬁcial sweetener perillaldehyde oxime  de Oliveira and Strapasson 2000 . a-Pinene can be oxidized to verbenone, which is used by the ﬂavoring industry  Agrawal and Joseph 2000 . Sesquiterpenes are transformed by fungi to a variety of products  Abraham et al. 1992; Miyazawa et al. 1995; 1997; 1998 . Other hydrocarbons may be transformed by fungi to inter- mediates that are useful in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals  9 CONCLUSIONS  Fungi are capable of cometabolizing most hydrocarbons. However, only a few fungi are known to grow on hydrocarbons, such as methane, n-hexadecane, toluene, styrene, or phenanthrene, as sole carbon sources. Since various fungi oxidize hydrocarbons, often in a stereoselective manner, some strains have been selected to carry out speciﬁc biocatalytic transformations to produce higher-value pro- ducts. Many fungi transform toxic hydrocarbons to oxidized derivatives and a few strains are able to cleave aromatic rings; thus these fungi have the potential for use, preferably together with bacteria, for the bioremediation of toxic wastes in the environment. Several research on the fungal degradation of hydrocarbons are likely to be productive in the future. These include:  a  Investigating the roles of yeasts and ﬁlamentous fungi in transforming naturally occurring hydrocarbons at the concentrations usually found in the environment.  b  Finding additional ways to transform abundant renewable resources, including by-products from agriculture and forestry, into chiral drug precursors and other high-value products.  c  Developing practical combinations of fungi and bacteria that can be used for the large-scale bioremediation of soils contaminated with mixtures of hydrocarbons.  lines of  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  I am grateful to Carl E.

Bumpus University of Northern Iowa, Cedar Falls, Iowa, USA  1  INTRODUCTION  The manufacture and use of dyes and pigments is a multibillion-dollar industry. The use of these substances is an integral part of almost all manufacturing processes. Interestingly, the widespread use of synthetic colorants and the modern dye industry dates only to 1856 with the synthesis of mauveine by W.H. Perkin  Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology 1992 . Of all the different types of dyes, azo dyes are the most useful and widely used colorants. In 1858, J. P. Griess synthesized a yellow azo dye that was commercialized brieﬂy  Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology 1992 . Other azo dyes that saw early commercialization included Chrysodine  in 1875 , Congo Red  in 1884 , and Bismark Brown. Following these early syntheses, numerous azo dyes have been made and it is estimated that over 2,000 are in use  Colour Index, 3rd Ed. . Wastewaters are produced during the synthesis and use of dyes. Such wastewaters must be treated. The most important criterion for treatment of wastewater is that associated toxicity is reduced to acceptable levels. Similarly, odors must be reduced and the amount of dissolved material must be reduced. Decolorization of water is also a primary goal of water puriﬁcation processes and one that to dye-containing wastewaters.  is critical  There are several reasons for the popularity and use of azo dyes. Azo dyes are available in almost every color across the spectrum, as a group they are colorfast and many can be structurally modiﬁed to bind to a variety of natural and synthetic fabrics  Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology 1992 . Unfortunately, azo dyes are resistant to biological degradation. This is likely due to the fact that azo linkages are rarely found in nature. Thus micro-organisms have not often been exposed to compounds containing this functional group and there have been few instances in which  selective pressures on micro-organisms would have favored survival of those species that evolved enzymes capable of speciﬁcally destroying azo dyes. The toxicity of azo dyes makes it important that ways be found to treat wastewaters that contain these substances.  there were few reports of  This review focuses on the ability of fungi to degrade azo dyes. Before, 1990, the biodegradation of azo dyes by aerobic micro-organisms. Cripps et al.  1990  showed that three azo dyes were extensively, degraded by the white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium under aerobic conditions. Since that time, many manuscripts have been published documenting degradation of azo dyes by P. chrysosporium and other fungi. Like P. chrysosporium, most of the other fungi studied and shown to degrade azo dyes are white rot fungi. Interestingly, however, a few fungi that are not white rot fungi have been reported to have some ability to degrade this important class of compounds. The ability of white rot fungi and other micro-organisms to degrade azo dyes was reviewed by this author several years ago  Bumpus 1995 . A number of reviews addressing, at least in part, the biodegradation and or biodecolorization of azo dyes in water by white rot fungi have appeared recently  Stolz 2001; Fu and Viraraghavan 2001; Knapp et al. 2001; Robinson et al. 2001; McMullan et al. 2001 . This review summarizes this area of research and important recent observations while attempting to keep overlap with other reviews at a minimum.  2 DECOLORIZATION AND  BIODEGRADATION OF AZO DYES BY WHITE ROT FUNGI  The remarkable biodegradative abilities of the white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium  Bumpus et al. 1985   Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   led Cripps et al.  1990  to study the ability of this fungus to degrade azo dyes. It was shown that Orange II, Tropaeolin O, and Congo Red were all extensively decolorized in nutrient nitrogen limited cultures of this fungus. Nutrient nitrogen  limited conditions were selected because, in this fungus, such conditions promote expression of the lignin degrading system and it is this system that is thought to be instrumental in biodegradation of xenobiotics. Involvement of the lignin  Figure 1 Representative azo dyes degraded by white rot fungi.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

Although initial studies  Cripps et al. 1990  suggested that lignin peroxidases did not oxidize Congo Red, subsequent investigations  Tatarko and Bumpus 1998  showed that this dye is indeed, a substrate for these enzymes.  Decolorization as measured by visible spectroscopy is an exceptionally easy and inexpensive way to monitor degradation of dyes by micro-organisms. However, other techniques are required in order to obtain a true picture of the extent of degradation that occurs. Degradation of azo dyes to carbon dioxide by P. chrysosporium was demonstrated by  Figure 1  continued   Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   Spadaro et al.  1992  who showed that 23.1 – 48.1% of the aromatic ring labeled carbon atoms in 7 azo dyes 0 -  4-phenylazophenol, 4-phenylazo-2-methoxyphenol, 2- 4 acetamidophenylazo -4-phenylazophenol  Disperse Yellow 3 , 4-phenylazoaniline, N,N-dimethyl-4-phenylazoaniline,  -nitrophenylazo -aniline  Disperse-Orange 3 , and 4- 4 1-phenylazo-2-naphthol  Solvent Yellow 14  were oxidized to carbon dioxide by P. chrysosporium. Paszczynski et al.  1992  synthesized several ring-labeled sulfonated azo dyes and showed that substantial quantities  17.2 – 34.8%  of  0  Figure 1  continued   Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   the labeled carbon atoms in the dyes were degraded to carbon dioxide by P. chrysosporium. Among the dyes degraded to carbon dioxide were Acid Yellow, Orange I, Orange II, 4- 3- methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylazo benzenesulfonic acid, and 4- 2-sulfa-3  -methoxy-4-hydroxyazobenzenesulfonic acid.  0  P. chrysosporium has served well as a model micro- organism for the study of the degradation of azo dyes and other environmentally persistent organic pollutants. However, it has been shown that a number of other white rot fungi are able to degrade hard-to-degrade compounds, including azo dyes. Representative azo dyes degraded by white rot fungi are illustrated in Figure 1.  As discussed below, some of these fungi have degradative abilities and other properties that will likely make them superior to P. chrysosporium for use in bioremediation systems. White rot that have been reported to degrade decolorize azo dyes are listed in Table 1.  fungi  Several Myrothecium spp. and Ganoderma spp. were shown by Mou et al.  1991  to be able to decolorize Orange II as well as two other diazo sulfonated dyes designated as RS WC  and lOB H C . Several experiments were performed using M. verrucaria. Results showed that this fungus was more effective than activated sludge in decolorizing wastewater from a dye-manufacturing plant. Decolorization of wastewater from a textile-dyeing factory was also studied. Five of six highly colored wastewaters were substantially decolorized. It is interesting to note that some experiments were performed at high pH values, one as high as pH 11. In some wastewaters, the concentration of sodium chloride was as high as 15%  w v . Adsorption to mycelium was shown to be an important mechanism for wastewater decolorization. In some experiments, adsorption was followed by slow decolorization of the mycelium. However, it should be noted that decolorization of mycelium was not observed in all experiments even after extended  1 month  incubation.  The effect of carbon source on the decolorization of water containing Amaranth and Orange G was studied by Chao and Lee  1994 . Both dyes as well as the heterocyclic dye Azure B were decolorized by two strains of P. chrysosporium and another unidentiﬁed white rot fungus. Interestingly, decolor- ization was reported to occur if fungal strains were pre- cultured in a high nitrogen medium in the presence of glucose. This is of interest as high nitrogen conditions might be expected to repress expression of lignin peroxidases and manganese peroxidases, enzymes that would be expected to mediate decolorization of these dyes.  to degrade a variety of dyes,  Knapp et al.  1995  compared the ability of 7 wood-rotting fungi including the azo dyes, Mordant Yellow 10, Cibacron Brilliant Yellow 3G-P, Cibacron Brilliant Red 3B-A, Orange II, Brilliant Yellow, Chrysophenine, Chlorazol Yellow, and Acid Red 106. Results were variable in that all of the fungi were able to degrade extensively some of the dyes. No strain was able to degrade extensively all of the dyes. It is interesting to note that P. chrysosporium, was able to mediate 99 – 100% decoloriza- tion of 4 of the 14 dyes and 27 – 69% decolorization of the other 10. Nevertheless, P. chrysosporium was among the least effective of the fungal strains investigated. This study shows clearly that the biodegradative abilities of P. chrysosporium are substantial, but it is necessary to assess the biodegradative abilities of other white rot fungi as many will have even greater abilities. These investigations also showed that no one species of fungus was best for all of the dyes studied.  Dye decolorization may be achieved using intact fungal cultures or by using selected fungal enzymes. This may have important implications in bioreactor development. Young and Yu  1997  showed that a variety of dyes, including four azo dyes  Acid Violet 7, Reactive Black 5, Acid Orange 74, and Acid Black 24  were decolorized in culture by P. chrysosporium and Trametes versicolor. Of interest,  Table 1 Representative manuscripts documenting biodegradation of azo dyes by white rot fungi  Fungus  P. chrysosporium Myrothecium spp. T. versicolor  Strain F29 P. ostreatus B. adusta  T. hirsuta P. sanguineus I. lacteus  P. sajorcaju F. trogii  Dye  Congo Red, Orange II, Tropaeolin O Orange II, RS H S , 10B H C  Acid Violet 7, Reactive Black 5,  Acid Orange 74, Acid Black 24  Orange II Congo Red, Methyl Orange Reactive Violet 5, Reactive Black 5,  Reactive Orange 96, Reactive Red 198  Reference  Cripps et al.  1990  Mou et al.  1991  Young and Yu  1997   Knapp et al.  1997  Shin and Kim  1998  Heinﬂing et al.  1998a,b   15, Remazol Brilliant Orange 3R, Tropaeolin O  Amaranth, Remazol Black B Orange G, Amaranth Congo Red, Methyl Orange, Reactive Orange  16, Reactive Black 5  Amaranth, New Coccine, Orange G Astrazon Red FBL  Swamy and Ramsay  1999a,b  Pointing and Vrijmoed  2000  Novotny et al.  2001   Chagas and Durrant  2001  Yesilada et al.  2002   Bjerkandera BOS55  Amaranth, Remazol Black B, Reactive Blue  Swamy and Ramsay  1999a,b   Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

For example, 6.6% decolorization of the azo dye Acid Orange 74 was observed in solid agar cultures of P. chrysosporium. However, when incubated in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and lignin peroxidase from this fungus, 79.1% decolorization was observed. In some cases, the opposite was observed. In solid agar culture, 98% decolorization of Acid Black 24 occurred whereas when this dye was incubated with lignin peroxidase in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, only 25.4% decolorization occurred.  Shin and Kim  1998  showed that a peroxidase isolated from Pleurotus ostreatus decolorized several types of dyes including the azo dyes Congo Red and Methyl Orange. After 4 min, 77 and 26% decolorization of these dyes was noted. Of interest was the observation that addition of veratryl alcohol did not enhance the rate and extent of decolorization. This is in contrast to the observations by Ollikka et al.  1993  for lignin peroxidase from P. chlysosporium.  [2-methoxyphenol  Martins et al.  2001  synthesized several azo dyes having substituent groups  guaiacol  and 2,6-dimethoxyphenol  syringol ] that would be expected to be found in lignin. Such groups were designated as bioaccessible as they would be expected to be attacked by enzymes from lignin degrading fungi. Not unexpectedly, the extent of dye degradation depended on the concentration of sucrose used as a growth substrate and on the structure of the dye. Interestingly, degradation also depended on the structure of the dye present in cultures of P. chrysosporium that were allowed to grow in the presence of the dye and, presumably, the fungus became acclimated to the dye. This is similar to the approach taken by Paszczynski et al.  1991  who synthesized from Acid Yellow 9 and from sulfanilic acid two azo dyes having guaiacol groups. In this study, P. chrysosporium degraded these dyes more readily than the parent compounds that lacked the guaiacol group. Interestingly, none of the Streptomyces spp. degraded the parent compounds and only 5 of the 9 Streptomyces spp. degraded the new guaiacol-linked azo dyes.  Pasti-Grigsby et al.  1992  synthesized 16 azo dyes and assessed there ability, along with 6 commercially available azo dyes  Methyl Orange 52, Ethyl Orange, Acid Yellow 9, Acid Orange 12, Orange 1, and Orange 2 , to be degraded by P. chrysosporium and by Streptomyces spp. P. chrysosporium decolorized all of the newly synthesized dyes and the commercially available azo dyes. Most of the newly  i.e.,  85%  synthesized dyes underwent substantial decolorization when the initial concentration of dye was 150 mg L. However decolorization ranged from 27 to 99% at this concentration and from 15 to 97% when the initial concentration was 300 mg L.  Novotny et al.  2001  studied the biodegradative ability of 103 strains of wood-rotting fungi. A strain of Irpex lacteus and a strain of P. ostreatus were selected for further investigation to decolorize several different types of dyes including the azo dyes Congo Red, Methyl Orange, Reactive Orange 16, Reactive Black 5, and Naphthol Blue Black. Both  of these fungal strains substantially degraded representative azo and diazo dyes as well as anthraquinone, heterocyclic, triphenylmethane, and phthalocyanine dyes. is worth mentioning, however, that the diazo dye, Congo Red appeared to be one of the dyes that was comparatively more resistant to degradation. I. lucteus caused only 58% decolorization of this dye during 14 days of incubation.  It  Recently, several other white rot fungi have been shown to be able to degrade azo dyes. Heinﬂing et al.  1998a,b  showed that Bjerkundera adusta is able to degrade azo dyes. These authors have also puriﬁed and characterized manganese peroxidases and lignin peroxidases from this fungus and have documented their involvement in azo dye degradation. Azo dyes degraded by B. adusta include Reactive Violet 5, Reactive Black 5, Reactive Orange 96, and Reactive Red 198. is worth noting that B. adusta is the most common It Bjerkandera species in Europe  Heinﬂing et al. 1998a .  Swamy and Ramsay  1999a,b  studied the ability of P. chrysosporium, Bjerkandera sp. BOS55, P. ostreatus, Trametes hirsuta and T. versicolor to decolorize 6 dyes, including 4 azo dyes, in solid plate cultures. P. ostreatus was not able to decolorize any of the dyes  the azo dyes Amaranth, Remazol Black B, Tropaeolin O, and Remazol Brilliant Orange 3R and the phthalocyanine dye Reactive Blue 15 and the anthroquinone dye Remazol Brilliant Blue R  under investigation. Bjerkandera sp. BOS55 and Trametes versi- color were most effective in their ability to decolorize these dyes. Both were able to decolorize all of the dyes to some extent. P. chrysosporium and T. hirsuta possessed inter- mediate decolorization ability. P. chrysosporium did not decolorize Remazol Brilliant Orange 3R and only marginally decolorized Tropaeolin O. This fungus did cause substantial decolorization of Amaranth, Remazol Black B, and Reactive Blue 15. T. hirsuta decolorized Amaranth and Remazol Black B. T. hirsuta did not decolorize Remazol Brilliant Orange 3R and only marginally decolorized Reactive Blue 15 and Tropaeolin O. It appears that the ability of a given fungus to decolorize a dye depends on certain culture conditions. For example, P. chrysosporium did decolorize Remazol Brilliant Orange 3R in solid culture. However, in agitated  200 rpm  pelleted cultures substantial  85% in 18 days  decolorization occurred. Similarly, it was shown that decolorization occurred more rapidly in agitated liquid cultures, in which fungi formed pellets, than in stationary cultures in which the fungi were present as mycelial mats. Although Bjerkundera sp. BOS55 was superior in its ability to cause decolorization in solid agar cultures, T. versicolor was superior in agitated pelleted liquid cultures. This will be problematic for reactor development because selection of micro-organisms to be used cannot necessarily be based on their performance in solid agar culture. Thus the effectiveness of a micro-organism for dye decolorization will have to be judged on the basis of conditions similar to those under which it will be used in actual wastewater treatment systems. Swamy and Ramsay  1999a,b  also assessed the ability of Bjerkandera sp. BOS55, P. chrysosporium and T. versicolor to decolorize the 5 dyes added sequentially, each after the dye last added had been  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   completely decolorized. In the last step of this experiment all of the dyes were added as a mixture. In this experiment, only T. versicolor was able to degrade all of the dyes. Indeed, P. chrysosporium and Bjerkandera sp. BOS55 lost their decolorization ability following decolorization of Amaranth and Remazol Black. This investigation demonstrates that the most effective fungal system for decolorization will depend on several things including the choice of fungus, the buffer, the dyes to be degraded, and culture agitation.  Knapp et al.  1997  showed that strain F29, obtained from an unidentiﬁed fruiting body from a white rot fungus found growing on rotting willow wood was able to cause substantial  98%  decolorization of water containing up to 1000 mg L of Orange II in only two days. This is remarkable as Pasti- Grigsby et al.  1992  showed that it took P. chrysosporium 15 days to achieve 53 and 99% decolorization of water containing 300 and 150 mg L Orange II, respectively. Knapp et al.  1997  reported that a carbon source other than Orange II was required for decolorization and that a small amount of 21  seemed optimal and necessary nutrient nitrogen  0.25 g dm to maintain decolorization ability in long-term experiments. A pH of 5.3 – 6.3 appeared to be optimal. Addition of veratryl alcohol provided a slight in the rate of decolorization. However, addition of Mn II  resulted in a decolorization rate 70% greater than that of controls to which no additional Mn II  was added. These results led this research group to use this fungus in the development of bioreactors  Zhang et al. 1998  as discussed elsewhere in this review.  improvement  Pointing and Vrijmoed  2000  studied the ability of Pycnoporus sanguineus to decolorize two triphenylmethane dyes  Bromophenol Blue and Malachite Green  and two azo dyes  Orange G and Amaranth . These investigators also found that the azo dyes were more resistant to degradation than the other dyes studied. Complete or nearly complete decolorization of the triphenylmethane dyes occurred while only partial  up to 60%  decolorization of the azo dyes was observed. Adsorption of dye to mycelium was not a major factor in decolorization by this fungus.  Yesilada et al.  2002  showed that Funalia trogii  in pelleted form could decolorize relatively high concentrations  264 mg L  of Astrazon Red FBL. Astrazon dyes are widely used basic dyes. In these investigations, which were the ﬁrst to study biodegradation of Astrazon dyes by a white rot fungus, it was shown that at a dye concentration of 13 mg L,  fungal pellets could be reused up to ﬁve times with great effectiveness  i.e., 92 – 98% color removal occurred . At higher concentrations  264 mg L  similar color removal was observed only when an increased amount of fungal mass was used. However, in these experiments, repeated use of the fungal pellets resulted in lower amounts  0 – 73%  of decolorization. It appears that the dye is toxic to the fungus at high concentrations. Nevertheless, it is clear that fungal pellets can be reused several times to remediate water containing dyes at concentrations that might be expected to be present importance was the observation that dye degradation occurred over the pH range 6 – 11. It should also be noted that, like several other white rot fungi, dye adsorption by fungal mycelium was followed by decolorization of the mycelium.  in wastewater. Also of  Chagas and Durrant  2001  compared the ability of P. chrysosporium and Pleurotus sajorcaju to decolorize four azo dyes. P. chrysosporium in solid culture medium partially decolorized Amaranth, New Coccine, Orange G, and Tartrazine. P. sarorcuju decolorized Amaranth, New Coccine, and Orange G. It did not decolorize Tartrazine. In liquid cultures of P. chrysosporium total decolorization of Amaranth, New Coccine, and Orange G and 60% decolorization of Tartrazine was observed. P. sajorcaju mediated total decolorization of Amaranth and Coccine, 50% of Orange G and 20% of Tartrazine. In these investigations, lignin peroxidase activity was not observed. However, manganese peroxidase activity was observed in cultures of P. chrysosporium and laccase activity was found in cultures of P. sajorcaju suggesting that these enzymes are important in dye degradation.  3 DECOLORIZATION AND  BIODEGRADATION OF AZO DYES BY FUNGI OTHER THAN WHITE ROT FUNGI  In recent years there have been many reports regarding biodegradation of azo dyes by white rot fungi  Bumpus 1995; Stolz 2001; Yuzhu and Viraraghavan 2001; Knapp et al. 2001; Robinson et al. 2001; McMullan et al. 2001 . In contrast, there have been only a few reports focusing on biodegradation and or decolorization of azo dyes by fungi that are not white rot fungi. Some of these fungi are listed in Table 2.  Table 2 Manuscripts describing adsorption of or biodegradation of azo dyes by fungi other than white rot fungi  Fungus  N. crassa A. sojae B-10 A. foetidus  C. inaequalis  Dye  Reference  Vermelho Reanil P8B Amaranth, Sudan II, Congo Red Drimarene Red, Drimarene Blue Drimarene Black Chicago Sky Blue 6B  Corso et al.  1981  Behung-Ho and Weon  1992  Sumanthi and Phatak  1999  Sumanthi and Manju  2000  ten Brink et al.  2000   Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   incubation period in water  As noted by Chung and Stevens  1993  an early report by Riedel  1942  showed that azo dyes were reduced by yeasts but that pure culture isolations were not reported in this study. In a study focusing on the use of fungi to treat industrial efﬂuents containing an azo dye it was shown by Corso et al.  1981  that the Ascomycete Neurospora crassa was able to decolorize water containing Vermelho Reanil P8B. In these studies 91.3 – 89.1% decolorization was achieved during a 24-hr in which the dye concentration was 16 – 32 mg L. These dye concentrations are typical of those that would be found in wastewater. Behung-ho and Weon  1992  reported that the Ascomycete Aspergillus sojae B-10 was able to mediate substantial decolorization of Amaranth, Sudan III, and Congo Red. The effect of several nutrient nitrogen sources on decolorization was assessed. Nitrogen containing salts  ammonium tartrate, sodium nitrate, ammonium nitrate, and ammonium sulfate  appeared to promote decolorization relative to biologically derived nitrogen sources  peptone, malt extract, and yeast extract . It was also shown that decolorization decreased as a function of sodium nitrate concentration for all three dyes that were studied. Adsorption contributed to the decolorization that was observed. However, the authors assert that biodegradation was also important in this process. If this decolorization is, indeed, due to biodegradation and not simple adsorption it will be interesting to determine the mechanisms by which biodegradation occurs as they will almost certainly be different than those which occur in white rot fungi.  Sumanthi and Phatak  1999  and Sumanthi and Manju  2000  showed that Aspergillus foetidus was able to decolorize in culture several azo dyes  Remazol Red, Remazol Dark Blue HR, Remazol Brown GK, Drimarene Red, Drimarene Blue, Drimarene Black, Procion Green, and Procion Turquoise . However, these investigators noted that decolorization was due primarily to biosorption and that little biotransformation occurred.  Curvularia spp. are members of the Ascomyctes and include animal and plant pathogens. Unlike the other fungi discussed in this review, Curvularia inaequalis produces a peroxidase that contains vanadate rather than heme  ten Brink et al. 2000 . This vanadium containing peroxidase requires hydrogen peroxide as a cosubstrate and mediates oxidation of halides to hypohalous acid. It also mediates the sulfoxidation of organic sulﬁdes to sulfoxides and the one-electron -azino-bis 3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic oxidation of 2,2 acid  to its free radical product  ten Brink et al. 2000 . It has been shown that the vanadate-containing peroxidase from this fungus mediates oxidation of the azo dye Chicago Sky Blue 6B  ten Brink et al. 2000 .  0  4 SELECTED ASPECTS OF THE ENZYMOLOGY OF AZO DYE DEGRADATION BY WHITE ROT FUNGI  White rot fungi are so named because they are able to preferentially degrade lignin in wood. When this occurs in  nature substantial amounts of cellulose often remain giving the decayed wood a white appearance. Conversely when brown rot fungi attack wood residual lignin, which is brown in color, remains. Thus one of the consequences of biodegrada- tion by white rot fungi is decolorization of naturally occurring substances. The enzymes responsible for the initial stages of biodegradation and decolorization are oxidative enzymes, primarily lignin peroxidases  ligninases , manganese peroxi- dases, and laccases  Kirk and Farrell 1987 . Lignin peroxidases and manganese peroxidases have reaction mechanisms similar to those of other peroxidases  e.g., horseradish peroxidases and lactoperoxidase   Dunford 1999 . These peroxidases contain a heme prosthetic group and require hydrogen peroxide as an oxidizing cosubstrate. In the ﬁrst step of the peroxidase reaction mechanism the enzyme undergoes a two-electron oxidation in which it is converted to compound I. Compound I is an activated form of the enzyme in which the heme iron exists as an oxyferryl  species in the 4 þ oxidation state. The other equivalent exists  as a porphyrin cation radical or, in some cases, as another radical species. The oxygen atom in the oxyferryl species is donated by hydrogen peroxide. The other oxygen atom originally present in hydrogen peroxide is reduced to water. Compound I is a good oxidant and is able to mediate the one- electron oxidation of a variety of organic pollutants, including several azo dyes. During the one-electron oxidations mediated by compound I, this activated peroxidase inter- mediate is reduced to compound II, which is also an activated oxyferryl peroxidase intermediate. Unlike compound I, which has an oxidation state that is two electron equivalents greater than the ferric resting state, the oxidation state of compound II is one electron equivalent greater than the ferric resting stating. Thus another one-electron oxidation of an azo dye or other reducing substrate converts compound II back to the resting state thereby completing the reaction cycle.  Lignin peroxidases and manganese peroxidases are relatively nonspeciﬁc in that they are able to oxidize a variety of substrates. On the other hand, these enzymes also exhibit some speciﬁcity. This has been demonstrated nicely by Pasti-Grigsby et al.  1992  who showed that some azo dyes are preferentially oxidized by lignin peroxidases whereas others are preferentially oxidized by manganese peroxidases. Veratryl alcohol is an endogenous substrate for lignin peroxidases produced by Phanerochaete chrysosporium. When this compound serves as substrate it undergoes two successive one-electron oxidations to form veratraldehyde. Of interest to this review is the fact that veratryl alcohol enhances oxidation of some substrates, including some azo dyes. It appears that some azo dyes  e.g., Biebrich Scarlet and Tartrazine  can undergo a one-electron oxidation by lignin peroxidase compound I forming the one-electron oxidation product of the dye and lignin peroxidase compound II  Paszyzynski and Crawford 1991 . However, compound II does not appear to be able to mediate oxidation of the azo dye. This results in accumulation of lignin peroxidase compound II and the reaction ceases. When veratryl alcohol is added, compound II oxidizes it and returns to the ferric resting state  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   of the enzyme which may then participate in another round of catalysis. By preventing accumulation of compound II veratryl alcohol enhances oxidation of the azo dye.  Wu et al.  1996  showed that nutrient carbon or nutrient nitrogen limited cultures of P. chrysosporium are able to decolorize Reactive Red 22. It was also reported that a crude preparation of lignin peroxidases mediated decolorization of Reactive Red 22 and another azo dye, Evan’s Blue. Similar to the observations of Paszyzynski and Crawford  1991  it was found that the presence of veratryl alcohol enhanced decolorization of Reactive Red 22.  Manganese peroxidases are so named because they mediate the one-electron oxidation of Mn II  to Mn III   Kuwahara et al. 1984; Glenn et al. 1986; Wariishi et al. 1988 . In vitro, this reaction is often performed in the presence of a metal chelator such as lactate or tartrate, the purpose of which is to facilitate dissociation of Mn III  from the enzyme in the form of a Mn III -lactate or Mn III -tartrate complex  Wariishi et al. 1992 .  In vivo, oxalate or malonate likely performs this function. This is of interest because Mn III -complexes are relatively good oxidants. They are also relatively stable. It is thought that Mn III -complexes are stable enough to diffuse away from the active site and mediate oxidation of lignin and other materials that are inaccessible or otherwise not amenable to direct oxidation by laccases, lignin peroxidases, or manganese peroxidases. Recent studies have shown that the speciﬁcity of manganese peroxidases varies considerably between fungal species. For example, Heinﬂing et al.  1998a,b  showed that Reactive Orange 96 and Reactive Red 198 were not oxidized by manganese peroxidase P1 from P. chrysosporium and that oxidation of Reactive Blue 5 by this enzyme was negligible. This enzyme slowly oxidized Reactive Violet 5 and activity was increased by.approximately ﬁve-fold when 0.3 mM MnSO4 was present in the reaction mixture. In contrast, the presence of 0.3 mM MnSO4 did not enhance oxidation of the other azo dyes studied. The ability of manganese peroxidases from other white rot fungi to oxidize these azo dyes was also studied. Of importance is the observation that substantial rates of dye oxidation occurred in reactions that were independent of manganese. Indeed, Mn II  was shown to function as a noncompetitive inhibitor of Reactive Black 5 oxidation by MnP1 from B. adusta. Manganese peroxidases from these fungi allow a strategy of direct oxidation  i.e., by the enzyme  or indirect oxidation  by Mn III -complexes  to be pursued. This may become important in bioreactor design and strategy development.  In addition to lignin peroxidases and manganese peroxidases, white rot fungi often produce laccases. These oxidases are also important in lignin degradation but unlike peroxidases, they do not contain heme. Laccases are more formally known as benzenediol:O2 oxidoreductases, EC 1.10.3.2 . Instead of heme, laccases require active site Cu II  ions for activity. During laccase-mediated reactions, diphe- nolic compounds undergo a four-electron oxidation. During this reaction, Cu II  is reduced to Cu I . During the next step in the reaction, Cu I  reduces molecular oxygen  O2  to  produce two molecules of water. During this reaction Cu I  is oxidized back to Cu II  thus completing the reaction cycle. Laccases can mediate other reactions. Wong and Yu  1999  showed that Trametes versicolor decolorized Acid Violet 7. Of interest was the observation that laccase did not directly oxidize this azo dye. However, in the presence of a low molecular weight compound substantial oxidation  i.e., decolorization  of this dye occurred. It was proposed that the low molecular weight compound was oxidized by laccase producing a reactive radical species, which then oxidized the dye molecule resulting in a colorless product.  Pointing and Vrijmoed  2000  have presented evidence implicating laccases produced by Pycnoporus sanguineus in the oxidation of the azo dyes Orange G and Amaranth and the triphenylmethane dyes Bromophenol Blue and Malachite Green. Evidence for this, however, was indirect as oxidation of these dyes was only correlated with laccase activity in cultures of this fungus. It should be noted, however, that P. sanguineus did not produce lignin peroxidase or manganese peroxidase.  Yesilada and Ozcan  1998  studied the ability of crude culture ﬁltrates to decolorize Orange II. It was shown that ﬁltrates from Coriolus versicolor but not P. chrysosporium, were able to mediate substantial decolorization of water contaminated with this dye. Decolorization was dependent on the age of the culture and was not dependent on the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Decolorization activity was inactivated by heat. Given the fact that C. versicolor produces laccase in abundance it is reasonable to suggest that this enzyme is responsible for the decolorization observed.  Production of veratryl alcohol  radical and Mn III  complexes may be of importance in lignin degradation as it has been suggested that these low molecular weight reactive species may be stable enough to diffuse into the 3-D lignin structure and mediate oxidations that are not accessible by direct enzymatic oxidation by lignin peroxidases, manganese peroxidases, or laccases  Barr and Aust 1994; Harvey et al. 1986; Glenn et al. 1986 . Veratryl alcohol radical may be too unstable and short-lived to accomplish this. However, Mn III  complexes do appear to be sufﬁciently stable for this purpose. Mn III  complexes appear to be able to oxidize phenolic units in lignin. They do not appear to be able to oxidize nonphenolic units  Popp and Kirk 1992; Wariishi et al. 1992 . However, when unsaturated fatty acids are added to reaction mixtures containing manganese peroxidase, Mn II  com- plexes, and hydrogen peroxide, lipid peroxidation occurs  Kapich et al. 1999 . Of interest is the observation that oxidants are produced, in such reaction mixtures, which are capable of oxidizing nonphenolic subunits in lignin as well as selected organic pollutants such as phenanthrene. Kapich et al.  1999  suggest that peroxyl radicals are produced that are responsible for the oxidations that occur.  Lignin peroxidases, manganese peroxidases, and laccases are by far the most studied oxidases found in white rot fungi. Because of their ability to degrade a wide range of organic compounds, it was reasonable to suspect that cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases may be responsible for some of  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   the oxidations that have been observed. Indeed, some of the documented oxidations that are mediated by P. chrysosporium have not been attributed to lignin peroxidases, manganese peroxidases, or laccases. As a case in point, during DDT degradation, the parent compound undergoes hydroxylation, forming dicofol  Bumpus et al. 1985 . To date, the enzyme responsible for this oxidation has not been identiﬁed and may well, indeed, be a cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase. This family of enzymes has not been extensively investigated in white rot fungi. Studies by Knapp et al.  1997  and by Yadav and Loper  2000  showed that P-450 monooxygenase genes exist in this fungus. Substantial evidence for P-450 mediated hydroxylation of benzo a pyrene was presented by Masaphy et al.  1996  who showed that microsomal and soluble fractions from P. chrysosporium exhibited characteristic reduced carbon monoxide difference spectra. Benzo a pyrene hydroxylation was shown to be dependent on NADPH and was inhibited by carbon monoxide. Furthermore benzo a pyr- ene caused a type I spectral shift  indicative of substrate binding  when added to soluble and microsomal preparations. A cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase is also thought to be responsible for phenanthrene oxidation during biodegradation of this compound by Pleurotus ostreatus  Bezalele et al. 1996 . Most recently, the genome of P. chrysosporium has been sequenced at the U.S. Department of Energy’s facility at Walnut Hill, California. This fungus is the ﬁrst basidiomycete whose genome has been sequenced. The genome is about 30 Mb and is comprised of 10 chromosomes. Of interest is the observation that this fungus may have the genetic potential to produce over one-hundred P-450 monooxygenases  Nelson 2001 . Clearly, elucidation of the contribution of P-450 monooxygenases to azo dye degradation and xenobiotic metabolism, in general, will be an area of considerable research interest.  5 METAL IONS AND THE POSSIBLE ROLE  OF SIDEROPHORES IN BIODEGRADATION OF DYES  Kirk et al.  1986  developed culture media for Phanerochaete chrysosporium containing certain supplemental nutrient mixtures of metal salts that enhance the level of lignin peroxidase activity produced in cultures of this fungus. Pointing et al.  2000  studied the ability of P. chrysosporium  IMI 284010 , Pycnoporus sanguineus  HKUCC 4065 , Trametes versicolor  HKUCC 4063 , and an unidentiﬁed fungal strain  HKUCC 4062  to decolorize several azo, triphenylmethane, heterocyclic, and polymeric dyes. All four strains were described as sub-tropical basidiomyceteous fungi. P. chrysosporium, T. versicolor, and the unidentiﬁed strain completely decolorized in liquid cultures the azo dyes Amaranth, Amido Black, Aniline Blue, Congo Red, Methyl Orange, Orange G, Ponceau 2R, and Trypan Blue during a 14-day incubation period. P. sanguineus decolorized Amido Black, Aniline Blue, Methyl Orange, Orange G, and Trypan  these fungi  to decolorize several  Blue. This fungus did not decolorize Amaranth, Congo Red, and Ponceau 2R. These investigators also studied the ability of triphenylmethane, heterocyclic, and polymeric dyes. Several dyes were decolorized. However, in general, the azo dyes appeared to be more resistant to degradation. Also studied were the inhibitory effects of three metal ions [Cd II , Cu II , and Zn II ] on dye degradation. These studies were performed using Poly R 478. It was shown that T. versicolor  HKUCC  and the unidentiﬁed strain  HKUCC 4062  decolorized this dye in the presence of 0.1 mM Cu II , and Zn II . Cd II  appeared inhibitory to T. versicolor at this concentration. Interestingly, the unidentiﬁed strain was able to mediate decolorization of Poly R 478 at a Cd II  concentration of 0.25 mM. In contrast, when P. chrysosporium was studied, decolorization was inhibited by metal ion concentrations of 0.1 mM. Although Poly R 478 is not an azo dye, this study suggests that the presence of metal ions in dye containing wastewater is one of the factors that must be taken into consideration in developing bioreactors based on the use of basidiomycetaceous fungi.  Fungi often grow in conditions where iron concentrations are vanishingly low. Iron is essential for metabolism  i.e., electron transport system . Thus fungi have evolved ways of sequestering this essential element. To do this, fungi secrete siderophores having very high afﬁnities for iron and certain other polyvalent cations and it is in the form of these metal siderophore complexes that metals are absobed by fungi  Fekete et al. 1989 . In addition to their role in sequestering metals, siderophores may have another important role as some siderophore – metal complexes appear to exhibit phenoloxidase-like activity. Some siderophore iron com- plexes are reduced from the ferric  III  to the ferrous II  oxidation state. When lignin is the electron donor, measurable lignin degradation takes place. Minussi et al.  2001  have studied this phenomenon using several dyes and have presented circumstantial evidence that siderophore – metal complexes might be involved in the decolorization of Reactive Blue 19, Reactive Red 195, Reactive Yellow 145, and Reactive Black 5 by wood rotting fungi. Although these studies are inconclusive, the involvment of metal – side- rophore complexes in the decolorization of azo dyes is an area that deserves further scrutiny.  6 DEVELOPMENT OF BIOREACTORS USED  FOR REMEDIATION OF AZO DYE CONTAINING WASTEWATER  White rot fungi have been proposed for remediation of soils contaminated with toxic organic pollutants such as DDT, polychlorinated phenols, and polycyclic aromatic hydro- carbons  Bumpus 1993 . However, decolorization and remediation of wastewater from a variety of industries that produce colored wastewater may be the most promising place for use of these fungi in bioremediation systems. Processes  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   developed to remediate colored wastewaters have been the subject of considerable research that has been reviewed recently by Knapp et al.  2001 . Although many investi- gations have focused on the ability of white rot fungi to decolorize degrade azo dyes, only a few investigations have speciﬁcally focused on development of bioreactors that could be scaled up and used for this purpose. Zhang et al.  1998  showed that an unidentiﬁed basidiomycete designated F29 was able to extensively and rapidly decolorize high concentrations of the azo dye Orange II in three different bioreactor conﬁgurations. Continuous packed-bed, fedbatch ﬂuidized-bed, and continuous ﬂuidized-bed bioreactors were studied. All of the bioreactors studied proved suitable for bioremediation of water-containing Orange II. Concen- trations of dye up to 1000 mg L were removed relatively rapidly  1 – 3.5 days  and the mycelium could be used repeatedly. Particular success was achieved with the fedbatch ﬂuidized bed-immobilized reactor. In this system average 21 hr 21 were achieved decolorization rates of 40 – 50 mg l resulting in 97% color removal in 24 hr. This study is signiﬁcant as it demonstrates that rapid degradation occurs and the fungal mycelium are robust and unaffected by exposure to high concentrations of Orange II during repeated exposure over 1 – 2 months.  Swamy and Ramsay  1999a,b  studied conditions, which promote azo dye degradation by Trametes versicolor, Bjerkundera adusta and Phanerochaete chrysosporium sequentially in batch reactors. Only T. versicolor proved to be able to maintain its ability to cause decolorization of water following repeated addition of the several dyes and dye mixtures.  Wang and Yu  1998  studied the ability of T. versicolor to decolorize water containing an anthroquinone dye, an indigo dye, and the azo dye Acid Violet 7. All of the dyes were degraded. These investigators also showed that adsorption to mycelium followed by dye degradation occurred. Adsorption was rapid and occurred with living mycelium and with heat killed controls. With live fungi, mycelium was regenerated by physical desorption and enzymatic degradation. The authors suggest that a sequential treatment system could be developed in which dyes in wastewater could be ﬁrst adsorbed on fungal mycelium followed by decolorization degradation. is reasonable to suggest that sequencing batch reactor technology might function well in this situation. Indeed, Borchert and Libra  2001  have used T. versicolor in 4-L sequencing batch stirred tank reactors to decolorize water containing the azo dyes Reactive Black 5 and Reactive Red 198 and the anthroquinone dye Brilliant Blue R. Reactors were cycled repeatedly over the course of the experiments. During long-term  200 days  experiments under sterile conditions, 18 dye additions occurred. In each case substantial color removal occurred. When the initial concentration of dye was 100 mg L, 97 – 99.5% decolorization occurred. When the initial concentration was 500 mg L, 91 – 99% decolorization occurred. When similar experiments were performed under nonsterile conditions, only 5 decolorization cycles  during a 55-day experiment  were possible due to bacterial  It  contamination, which appeared to interfere with peroxidase activity, resulting in decreased decolorization. Biodegrada- tion of Acid Violet 7 was also studied in liquid batch cultures and in a ﬂuidized bed reactor  Zhang and Yu 2000 . In both cases, the ability of mycelial pellets to degrade this dye was studied. An interesting aspect of this research was that added activated charcoal had a positive effect on biodegradation. It was shown that fungal mycelium surrounded a core of activated charcoal to form complex pellets. These complex pellets appeared to enhance biodegradation by adsorbing both the dye and fungal enzymes responsible for biodegradation. Furthermore, decolorization by the complex pellets was superior to that observed for fungal pellets without activated charcoal, for fungal pellets to which activated charcoal was added  after pellet formation  and to activated charcoal alone. It was also shown that reactors operated in repeated-batch-fed mode resulted in greater and more efﬁcient decolorization than reactors operated in a continuous ﬂow mode. In one experiment a repeated-batch-fed reactor was able to decolorize 9 additions of dye over a period of 130 h. Batch-fed additions of dye ranged from 100 to 500 mg L.  Mielgo et al.  2001  studied the use of immobilized P. chrysosporium in continuous ﬂow packed bed bioreactors. 21 greater than 95% At dye loading rates of 0.2 g l decolorization was achieved at hydraulic retention times of 24 h. In these experiments, the temperature was maintained at 378C and oxygen was supplied in a pulsed ﬂow.  21 d  Trametes hirsuta was shown to effectively decolorize the azo dyes Reactive Black 5 and Direct Blue 71 as well as representative triphenylmethane, indigoid, and anthraquinone dyes  Abadulla et al. 2000 . All of the dyes were decolorized by the laccase isolated from T. hirsuta. This research is important as it addressed the issue of recycling dye- contaminated water. Water decolorized using the intact fungus or laccase in solution was not suitable for reuse in dyeing operations due, presumably, to interference by soluble protein. However, when a reactor containing immobilized laccase was used, the recycled decolorized wastewater was suitable for dyeing operations as the laccase was retained in the bioreactor.  7 CONCLUSIONS  It is clear that white rot fungi are able to mediate extensive and often rapid degradation of azo dyes. Although several micro-organisms  other fungi and some bacteria  have been reported to be able to degrade this class of pollutant, it appears that white rot fungi have superior biodegradative abilities in this regard. The enzymes  lignin peroxidases, manganese peroxidases, traditionally associated with the lignin degrading system of this fungus are important. However, is likely that other oxidative enzymes, especially cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases may also be important and they require further scrutiny for a better understanding of how azo dyes  and other organic pollutants  are degraded by these fungi. There is substantial interest in  laccases, and other enzymes   it  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

Nicklin DSTL, Sevenoaks, Kent, United Kingdom  1  INTRODUCTION  it  is now a requirement  Explosive compounds are very signiﬁcant environmental contaminants. Their production, testing, use in conﬂict, and disposal has led to contaminated soils, sediments, and water around the world  Spain et al. 2000 . These materials are intrinsically toxic to microbes, plants, animals, and man. In the United States, that sites contaminated by these compounds are risk assessed and remediated to acceptable standards determined by site- speciﬁc clean-up goals  Jerger and Woodhull 2000 . Various remediation strategies have been adopted to date, and these have involved physical, chemical, and biological approaches  Newcombe and Crawford 2002 . Physical techniques such as incineration, activated carbon absorption, and ﬁltration are effective, but generate unwanted residues that still have to be treated. Chemical treatments have been tried, for example precipitation using surfactants and solvent extraction  Kaplan 1990  but again these approaches generate further residues that have to be disposed of. Biological treatments have included biostimulation of existing indigenous microﬂora and bioaugmentation where an explosive degrading microbial inoculum is added to the contaminated environment  Kaplan 1990 . Biological approaches appear to be cost effective alternatives to other methods, but they have had limited success because of microbial sensitivity to toxic levels of explosive, toxic by-products of incomplete degradation and the length of time biological clean-up of a contaminated environment can take  Reddy 1995 . This review seeks to summarize available information about the metabolic path- ways involved in fungal biodegradation of explosives and to evaluate the distribution of these pathways across the taxonomic groups.  2 EXPLOSIVES AS SUBSTRATES FOR  MICROBIAL DEGRADATION  2.1  2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene  TNT   The nitro-aromatic compound 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene  TNT  is of greatest concern as an environmental contaminant  Figure 1a . It is intrinsically difﬁcult for microorganisms to mineralize as the three symmetrically placed nitro- groups on the aromatic ring reduce its electron density and limits attack by electrophilic di-oxygenase enzymes  Nishino et al. 2000 . Moreover, TNT is poorly soluble in water  140 mg l at 258C , relatively stable and persistent in the environment  Gorontzy et al. 1994 . Its partial breakdown products are more hazardous, recalcitrant, carcinogenic, and mutagenic than the parent compound  Bennett 1994; Whong and Edwards 1984; Won et al. 1976 .  Natural decomposition is often the result of co-metabolic bio-transformation but not mineralization and breakdown products include mutagenic reduced amines  Yinon 1990 . Nitroaromatic compounds such as TNT are very rarely produced in nature. A few antibiotics containing nitro- aromatic groups are produced by Pseudomonas sp., for example nitropyrrolluteorin  Ohmori et al. 1978  and oxypyrrolenitrin  Hattari et al. 1970 . Streptomyces venezuelae has also been reported to produce chloramphe- nicol, and bryozoans have been reported to produce the antibiotic phidolophin  Tischler et al. 1986 . Nitrophenolic compounds such as aristolochic acid can be produced by plants  Williams and Barnaby 1977  and this compound has been identiﬁed as a potent carcinogen, intercalating or forming adducts with DNA leading to oncogensis  Arlt et al. 2000 .  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   RDX production with a higher melting point than RDX. This explosive has a very low aqueous solubility of 5 mg l at 258C. These compounds are truly xenobiotic, and do not occur naturally. Nitramines are acutely toxic and are class C carcinogens  Hawari et al. 2000a .  2.3 Origins and Evolution of Degradation  Pathways  The xenobiotic nature of these compounds and their poor aqueous solubility may help explain why, to date, they have accumulated in the environment. However, within the last decade, after considerable exposure, bacteria are now being isolated from contaminated environments that are capable of mineralizing some of these explosives. For example, a TNT degrading Pseudomonas sp. has been isolated from contaminated water samples from a nitrobenzene production site  Parales 2000 . Examination of the gene clusters associated with the nitroarene degradation pathway of this bacterium indicates that the evolution of the pathways is a recent event. This is suggested by the fact that the pathway is not optimized, there are vestigial genes, a lack of co-ordinated regulation, and long acclimatization times  Parales 2000 .  3 BIODEGRADATION OF TNT BY FUNGI  the fungi  the sensitivity of  In contrast to the newly evolved pathways we see in the bacteria, fungi have the capability to biodegrade explosives using existing, initially co-metabolic, pathways that lead to mineralization. Parrish  1977  published the results of a screen of the explosive degrading capability of 190 fungi. fungi were capable of TNT This study showed that degradation, but to levels exceeding 20 ppm was such that Parrish discounted their use in bioremediation. Bennett  1994  comments that the interpretation of results from this work appears to have delayed more serious consideration of fungi as explosive degraders for some years. However, more recent screens have shown that the ability to degrade TNT to some degree was distributed across many genera within the Zygomycota, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota  Scheibner et al. 1997b; Weber et al. 2002 . Recent data suggests that under the right conditions fungi are capable of achieving mineralization of TNT at rates far higher than bacteria  Hawari et al. 2000a . The best studied fungal TNT decomposer is the lignin decomposing Basidiomycete Phanaerochaeta chryso- sporium. This fungus was ﬁrst noted for its lignolytic capabilities when it was found to cause the overheating of woodchip piles  Burdsall 1981  but to date its natural niche is unknown. It has been demonstrated in numerous studies to be capable of TNT degradation  Esteve-Nunez et al. 2001; Fernando et al. 1990 . The initial reduction of TNT is independent of the ligninase enzymes associated with its mineralization, and is mediated by nonspeciﬁc nitro- reductases that catalyze the conversion of highly oxidized  Figure 1 Chemical structures of the major classes of explosives.  a  TNT.  b  PETN.  c  Nitrocellulose.  d  RDX.  e  HMX.  2.2 Nitrate Esters and Methylene Nitramine  Cyclic Esters  including glycerol  trinitrate  nitroglycerin  Nitrate esters, and pentaerythritol tetra nitrate  PETN   Figure 1b  are pharmacologically active at low concentrations and at high concentrations they are acutely toxic  Gorontzy et al. 1994 . Other nitrate esters, like cellulose nitrate  Figure 1c , are nontoxic and relatively stable. Naturally occurring, biologi- cally generated, organic nitrate esters appear very rarely. There is a single report of an insect sex pheromone that contains a nitrate ester  Hall et al. 1992 .  Another group of energetic compounds that are signiﬁcant environmental contaminants are cyclic trimers of methylene nitramine  Gorontzy et al. 1994   Figure 1d and e . This group includes the most powerful military explosives in use today, RDX  cyclotrimethlenetrinitramine  and HMX  octahydro- 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine . RDX is often mixed with TNT and is therefore a common environmental co-contaminant. It also has a limited aqueous solubility of 42.3 mg l at 208C  Gorontzy et al. 1994 . HMX is used in shaped charges or as a rocket propellant and is a by-product of  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

Stahl and Aust reaction is dependent on the presence of a living mycelium and appears to be associated with a membrane bound redox system. This work was recently conﬁrmed by Van Aken et al.  1999 . However, Michels and Gottschalk  1995  have dependent TNT reported intracellular NADPH reductase activity. A further mechanism was reported by Eiler et al.  1999 . Using Bjerkandera adusta, they observed TNT breakdown was associated with a microsomal cytochrome P 450.  þ  þ  H  The initial co-metabolic reactions increase the electron density of the aromatic ring and facilitate electrophilic attack by lignin-degrading enzymes  Field et al. 1993 . Lignin and TNT degradation occurs by a series of co-metabolic, synergistic reactions that involve three enzymes, manganese peroxide  MnP , lignin peroxidase  LiP , and laccase. The peroxidase enzymes are haem-containing glycoproteins that require hydrogen peroxide to function and they catalyze single electron oxidations that generate free radicals. Hydrogen peroxide is generated by oxidase enzymes including glyoxyl- and aryl-oxidase. Laccase is a copper containing phenol oxidase, which uses molecular oxygen as its terminal electron acceptor  Fritsche et al. 2000 . Laccase can catalyze both polymerization and depolymerization reactions via oxidation  Harvey and Thurston 2001 . Subsequent mineralization steps of TNT reduction products,  including nitroso-toluene  NST , ortho-hydroxyl amino 2,4- dinitrotoluene  HADNT , ADNT, and DANT are illustrated in a putative pathway constructed by Hawari et al.  2000a   Figure 2  where the initial products are azo, azoxy, phenolic, and acylated derivatives. These compounds are already known to be mineralized by white rot fungi  Esteve-Nunez et al. 2001 . However in P. chrysosporum, HADNT is known to inhibit veratryl alcohol oxidation by LiP  Bumpus and Tartako 1994 . The veratryl alcohol to veratryl aldehyde conversion is essential for the production of free radicals that are involved in the oxidation of primary substrates of LiP. Thus biodegradation of TNT will be inhibited if levels of HADNT are allowed to accumulate. Bumpus and Tatarko  1994  reported that levels as low as 30 mM will inhibit enzyme activity. This sensitivity is regarded as a key limitation to the use of this fungus in biodegradation in the ﬁeld  Michels and Gottschalk 1995 .  For several years, research concentrated on P. chryso- sporium as a prime candidate for explosive degradation. However, other fungi have been screened and Table 1 summarizes published work to date. In some of the other fungal species screened, tolerance to TNT and its breakdown products can be much higher than that of P. chrysosporium. For example, Rhizopus nigricans was reported as being able to remove TNT from a medium containing 100 mg ml TNT  Klausmeier et al. 1974  and Irpex lacteus tolerated up to 50 mg ml of TNT, and was able to degrade TNT by more than one route, forming transient hydride-Meisen- heimer complexes  Kim and Song 2000 .

Glycerol tri-nitrate saturates at 1.5 g l, whilst fully substituted nitro-cellulose is completely insoluble in water  Williams and Bruce 2000 . Although these compounds are relatively stable, there is some evidence that in the natural environment they can be reductively transformed, forming alcohols and nitrates  Williams and Bruce 2000 . There is a dearth of published literature on fungal biodegradation of nitrate esters and the possible pathways by which such degradation could occur. The few fungi reported as having some degradative effects on nitrate esters are distributed across the mitosporic fungi and wood rotting Basidiomycete genera. Geotrichium candidum was shown to have denitration capability, generating glycerol dinitrate and glycerol mono-nitrate with glycerol-2 mono- nitrate the predominant product  Ducroq et al. 1990 . This work demonstrated a regio-speciﬁcity in the de-nitration, and they suggested that different enzymes were involved in the de-nitration reactions. P. chrysogenum appears also to have the ability to denitrate nitrate esters and in this Basidio- mycete, the enzymes responsible for these reactions appear to be glutathione-S-transferases  GST   Servent et al. 1991; 1992 . Glutathione-S-transferase enzyme activity has been located in the cytosol. Furthermore, these workers also identiﬁed a cytosolic and microsomal P450-like enzyme with similar activity. There are therefore at least two different classes of enzymes involved in the de-nitration of GTN, an oxygen insensitive glutathione-dependent enzyme that liberates nitrate, and an oxygen-sensitive NADPred dependent P450-like activity that liberates nitrous oxide. In all cases of fungal degradation of nitrate esters, additional carbon sources have had to be supplied, and degradation is only partial. Even when a cellulolytic species is combined in co-culture with a de-nitrating species  Sclerotium rolfsii plus Fusarium solani  decomposition is incomplete  Sharma et al. 1995; Sundaram et al. 1995 .  5 BIODEGRADATION OF RDX HMX BY  FUNGI  In contrast to TNT, RDX and HMX are intrinsically less recalcitrant. Once there is a change in the ring structure, for example by cleavage of a N – NO2 bond or C – C bond, the ring structure undergoes spontaneous decomposition, producing small nitrate and carbon containing compounds that are easily mineralized by many species of microorganisms  Hawari 2000 . However, there is only a limited literature on biodegradation of cyclic triamines. Bayman et al.  1995 ; Bayman and Redkar that mycelium of P. chrysogenum, Cladosporium resinae, Cyathus pallides, and Cunninghamella echinulata var elegans were not inhibited by 50 – 100 mg ml RDX, and that the RDX “disappeared” when incubated with these fungal species.   1997   report  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   However, it was not possible to trace the breakdown products or to determine if the disappearance was due to mineralization reactions or bio-transformations. Fernando and Aust  1991  reported that P. chrysogenum could mineralize RDX, and they provided some evidence that a free-radical chain mechanism was involved in the degradation, but again were unable to identify the initial products of decomposition.  6 USE OF FUNGI IN BIOREMEDIATION IN  THE FIELD  in soil without amendments or  A number of different strategies have been adopted where attempts have been made to exploit fungi in bioremediation. Early ﬁndings demonstrated that attempts to establish wood rotting species soil sterilization failed. Like the early failures in establishing biological control agents in soil  Faull 1986 , the indigenous micro ﬂora out-competed the inoculants unless there were large additions of substrates such as wood chips and other ligno-cellulosic materials to the soil  Bennett et al. 2002; Cerniglia and Sutherland 2002; Radtke et al. 1994 . Currently, a number of approaches are being tried, including soil piles and windrows  where “composting” may occur , soil farming, soil slurry reactors, and ﬁxed ﬁlm reactors  Rogers and Bunce 2001 .  6.1 Soil Piles and Windrows  Soil piles and windrows are created by mixing soil with wood chips, corn cobs, or other ligno-cellulosic materials and adding fungal inoculum on a lignocellulosic base. The pile is then left for an extended period of time with regular turning and wetting for composting, or no turning for the static pile. This approach can lead to a rapid disappearance of explosive contaminants. A number of different fungal inoculants have been tried. For example, Jerger and Woodull  2000  used Trametes versicolour and P. chrysosporium as soil pile inoculants, Fritsche et al.  2000  used Stropharia rugosoannulata and Spreinart et al.  1998  used B. adusta. This approach is being widely used in the United States for the clean up of military sites  USAEC 1999 . However, criticisms of this technique include the long incubation times needed for complete disappearance of the target substrate, and the high costs of set-up and maintenance. The process is further criticised for being based on unknown biological processes that may produce toxic breakdown products that bind to soil organic matter and undergo no further mineralization  Hawari 2000 . Furthermore, in many cases it has been shown that added microbial inoculants did not persist in the environment and it was the indigenous micro ﬂora that achieved much of the degradation  Gerth et al. 2001 .  6.2 Landfarming and Soil Slurry Reactors  Land farming, where inoculants and moisture are ploughed into soil on a large scale, has had little success using fungal inoculants and soil slurry reactors have also proven to work better with bacterial inoculants than fungal  Hawari et al. 2000b . However, Fritsche et al.  2000  remain optimistic about the potential of the land farming approach using fungal inoculants.  6.3 Bioreactors  Fungal inoculants have also been used in aqueous-based systems using ﬁxed fungal ﬁlms. They may be attached to  Sublette et al. 1992  rotating discs in a bioreactor  P. chrysosporium to degrade TNT and RDX  or in continuous culture air lift fermenters  Rho et al. 2001   P. chrysosporium with TNT .  7 FUTURE PROGRESS  is possible to identify some key features that  limit It successful use of fungi in bioremediation processes and identify possible strategies that might be employed to overcome them.  7.1 Use of Photocatalysis to Reduce Toxic Effects  of Breakdown Products  There is a sensitivity of key fungal enzymes to explosive degradation products that currently limits the use of fungi in bioremediation of contaminated materials. This is exempli- ﬁed by the sensitivity of veratryl alcohol oxidase activity of P. chrysosporim LiP to HADNT. A solution to this problem may be in the use of combined photo-catalytic and biological processes. The photo catalytic process degrades the toxic intermediates of breakdown and allows the fungal enzymes to continue mineralizing the products of photo-catalytic breakdown  Hess et al. 1998 .  7.2 Use of Anti-Oxidants to Control Quenching  There is evidence that one of the key elements of the degradation process, the production of free radicals via the activity of Lip and MnP, is quenched by the presence of humic compounds  Hawari 2000 . The use of fungi in controlled environments  particularly in ﬁxed ﬁlm reactors , where reduced glutathione and other thiols can be added to reverse the quenching effects, has produced promising results  Scheibner and Hofrichter 1998; Fritsche et al. 2000 .  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   7.3 Screening for New Fungal Species Strains  Strain selection for effective explosive-degrading fungi is far from complete. The rather random screening approach used to date has shown that the ability to degrade substrates like TNT is widespread across fungal genera  Scheibner et al. 1997a,b . Most of the species studied have been from temperate regions. However, the tropical species may well have greater lignolytic capabilities as they are able to decompose far more woody litter per year than the temperate species can  Swift et al. 1976 . Furthermore, many species of fungi with no lignin- degrading capability seem able to partially biodegrade TNT and other explosives by unknown metabolic routes. Understanding of the enzymology associated with these reactions would seem to be a priority. This would lead to a more rational screening approach.  7.4 Matching Colonization Strategies with  Bioremediation Requirements  It is essential to understand the way in which different fungi colonize and function in different niches. The initial phase of substrate colonization has little to do with ligninases  Evans and Hedger 2001 . Lignin has such a low caloriﬁc value that it cannot act as a sole carbon source, therefore white rot fungi only degrade lignin when they cannot utilize cellulose. For example T. versicolour enters wood through cuts in vessels or tracheids and it colonizes rapidly through these structures, utilizing soluble materials whilst sequestering and retaining substrate. Only after colonization and substrate possession is complete does cellulose availability become limited, and as nitrogen levels reduce to below 200:1 C:N lignin degradation begins. Other members of the Aphyllophorales, including Ganoderma sp., Fomes sp., and lnonotus sp., are slow to colonize and the onset of lignin degradation is even slower, but very recalcitrant molecules can be degraded  Evans and  Hedger 2001 . Species from the Sphaerales are slow lignin degraders with great tolerance to water stress. It is essential to understand such ecological effects and to match these biodegradative abilities with the desired end result before selecting a species of fungus to use in bioremediation of a particular substrate.  7.5 Use of Sorption Strategies  Bioattenuation humiﬁcation strategies are currently being seriously considered as alternatives to mineralization  Hawari et al. 2000a,b; Isbister et al. 1984; Weber et al. 2002 . In many experiments, mass balance equations prove that mineraliz- ation does not occur, but TNT breakdown products “disappear.” The process appears to be due to irreversible binding  sorption  of TNT breakdown products with the soil humic and clay fraction  Achtnich et al. 1999; Elovitz and Weber 1999; Weber et al. 2002 . Sorption mechanisms include electrostatic interactions and co-valent bonding  Head 1998   Figure 3 . Sorption interactions will also depend on the chemistry of the pollutant, and the amount of clay and organic content of the soil. Binding can also be mediated via oxido- reductive enzymes including laccase  Bollag et al. 1992 . The driving force behind accepting that “disappearence” is a satisfactory end point in bioremediation is the poor results so far obtained from in situ remediation of soil using fungal inoculants. Such an approach needs careful evaluation as Palmer et al.  1997  found that apparently irreversibly bound products could release sufﬁcient residues under certain conditions to be detectable in mammalian bioassays. The presence of these pollutants was not detectable by conventional analytical chemical techniques. Sorption is inﬂuenced by pH and high will release sorbed molecules  Head 1998 . Natural surfactants produced by indigenous soil microbes can also release sorbed products. There is an irreversible binding may not increasing awareness that  Figure 3 Interaction of TNT degradation products with materials in soil.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   actually occur, and there are many on-going studies on the use of toxicity assays to monitor composts produced by bioremediation  Gundersen et al. 1997; Rocheleau et al. 1999 .  8 CONCLUSIONS  There is clearly a pressing need for new approaches to bioremediation of explosives-contaminated soils and sedi- ments. There is increasing evidence that co-metabolically produced products of the incomplete degradation of explosive compounds such as TNT are not as tightly bound to clays and organic matter as was ﬁrst thought. Their presence in an ecosystem can be detected by bioassay even though, in terms of chemical analysis, they have disappeared. Current techniques have failed to fully exploit the capacity of fungi to mineralize these compounds via naturally occurring pathways. This appears to be because a limited selection of strains and species of fungi have been screened for their explosive degrading capability. We have an incomplete understanding of metabolic pathways involved in the strains that have been selected. We do not fully understand the microbial ecology of these fungi when used in bioremedia- tion. Further work is needed within all three of these areas before large scale, ﬁeld-based trials are undertaken that may create as many challenges as they overcome.

Allen Center for Conservation Biology, University of California, Riverside, California, USA  1  INTRODUCTION  Mycorrhizae are mutualistic symbioses between plants and fungi. As such, mycorrhizal fungi play an important role in structuring plant communities by improving the performance of individual plants. Improved growth and survival of host plants is mostly attributed to the ability of fungal partners to improve plant nutrition and rooting structure  Allen and Allen 1986; Allen et al. 1989; Lewis 1973  and enhance resistance to environmental stresses and soil pathogens  Sylvia and Williams 1992 . However, a variety of mycorrhizal types differentially affects their host plants. If the appropriate group of fungi is unavailable to form the type of mycorrhizal association to which a plant belongs, that group of plants may not remain or recover from a disturbance  Allen et al. 1993 . Disturbance alters fungal communities in different ways and fungal recovery typically occurs after initial plant establish- ment. As a consequence, functional mycorrhizae may require decades or may never occur.  the formation of  The importance of mycorrhizae to the restoration of arid plant communities has received considerable attention, most notably because successful establishment of mycorrhizae has implications to rates and patterns of plant succession  Allen and Allen 1990 . It is critical, therefore, to understand the key factors that regulate the natural reestablishment of mycor- rhizae  Allen et al. 1992 , and determine whether mycorrhizal inoculation is a viable alternative to managing existing fungal populations or manipulating their natural reinvasion. Although the speciﬁc factors that regulate natural reestablish- ment of mycorrhizae are not entirely known, they involve survival of residual fungal propagules, dispersal of propagules from adjacent undisturbed areas or from local sites of residual survival, and available microsites where plants and fungi  can survive and contact each other  Allen et al. 1992 . Alternatively, inoculations of a disturbed site with native or exotic fungi facilitate formation of mycorrhizae in a shorter period, given certain circumstances. The simple application of inoculum, however, does not guarantee the formation of a functional mycorrhiza. The potential beneﬁts of inoculation could be outweighed by cost and efﬁciency limitations, the probability of plants beneﬁting from mycorrhizae is low  Findlay and Kendle 2001 . Under- standing mycorrhizal function and limits of mycorrhizal function are critical in studying ecosystem response to disturbance and recovery from disturbance  Allen et al. 1999 .  if  In addition to examining the integral role of mycorrhizal fungi in ecosystem restoration, there has been considerable interest in determining the inﬂuence of mycorrhizal fungi on revegetation of severely polluted soils. The use of mycorrhizal fungi in bioremediation of metal-polluted soils has received increasing attention. Recent studies suggest that mycorrhizal fungi may exhibit some degree of heavy metal tolerance and as a result, confer heavy-metal tolerance in host plants. However, under natural conditions, the extent to which mycorrhizal associations beneﬁt plants, in terms of alleviating metal remains largely uncertain  Leyval et al. 1997 . In this chapter, we will address in more detail the response of mycorrhizal fungi to disturbance and the factors that inhibit or facilitate their natural recovery. We will also discuss management options for enhancing native fungal reestablishment and the potential beneﬁts and drawbacks of using mycorrhizal inoculum. Lastly, we will brieﬂy discuss the potential role of mycorrhizal fungi as bioindicators and their application to bioremediation.  toxicity,  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

Mycorrhizal associations are considered mutualistic because they are both the normal state  Smith and Read 1997  and a constant feature  Smith 1995  of most plants under most ecological conditions. There are several types of mycorrhizae characterized with respect to the organisms involved in the symbiosis and their anatomy and function. The most common is called an arbuscular mycorrhiza  AM . The AM fungi  Glomales, Zygomycetes  occur in most terrestrial environ- ments  Allen et al. 1995; Janos 1980  and are the dominant association in grassland, shrubland, and agricultural eco- systems. These fungi are characterized by the formation of arbuscules, thinly branched hyphal structures within root cortical cells responsible for transfer of immobile nutrients such as phosphorous  P  from fungi to plant. Arbuscular mycorrhizae fungi are obligate biotrophs, obtaining all of their carbon from a host plant, which makes culturing and mass-producing fungal isolates for large-scale inoculation efforts extremely difﬁcult. The second most common mycorrhizal type is ectomycorrhiza  EM . The majority of EM fungi are basidiomycetes and ascomycetes, with few species of zygomycetus fungi in the genus Endogone  Smith and Read 1997 . These fungi associate almost exclusively with woody plants in the Pinaceae and Fagaceae  Allen et al. 1995 . Ectomycorrhizae fungi do not penetrate the plant cell walls but surround them forming a Hartig net and encase individual roots with a mantle of fungal tissue. These fungi are used extensively in forest reclamation worldwide, the most common being Pisolithus tinctorius  Marx and Cordell 1989; Marx et al. 1976 , Rhizopogon spp.  Trappe 1977 , and Suillus spp.  Chapela et al. 2001 . Lastly, other less dominant mycorrhizal form important species-speciﬁc associations with ericaceous and orchidaceous plants should also be included in their restoration efforts.  types that  3 MYCORRHIZAL DIVERSITY  3.1 Fungal and Plant Species Richness  While plants vary in their dependence on mycorrhizal fungi, the fungi are generally obligate mutualists  Lewis 1973 . Interestingly, patterns of mycorrhizal diversity do not always follow those of plant diversity  Allen et al. 1995 . There are approximately 150 species of AM fungi  Morton et al. 1995; Schenck and Perez 1990  forming associations with about 70% of plants worldwide. Virtually any AM fungus can associate with any vascular plant capable of forming an AM  Allen et al. 1995 . Despite low fungal species richness, many AM communities can exhibit high plant species diversity. In Wyoming sagebrush-steppe, 11 species of AM fungi were found where plant species richness exceeded 150 species  Allen et al. 1993 . In a survey of 80 sites across the Great Basin in the western United States, Allen et al.  1993  found  only 48 species of AM fungi, with no one site containing more than 12 species. In a seasonal tropical forest, Allen et al.  1998  found approximately 25 – 30 species of AM fungi in a forest with plant species richness exceeding 1,000.  Unlike AM fungi, the formation of EM involves a greater fungal species  . 5400 species , exhibiting diversity of varying degrees of host speciﬁcity  Molina et al. 1992 . For example, the EM fungal genera, Hydnangium, is found only on Eucalyptus and Suillis and Rhizopogon are restricted to Pinaceae, while Amanita and Laccaria associate with most EM hosts  Molina et al. 1992 . Further, EM fungal diversity can be high in areas where plant community diversity is low. Early studies by Trappe  1977  estimated 2000 species of EM associated with Douglas Fir alone. In the Jarrah forest of southwestern Australia dominated by Eucalyptus marginate and E. calophylla, 90 species of EM fungi were found  Hilton et al. 1989 . Over 50 species of EM fungi were identiﬁed in a Quercus agrifolia stand near Temecula in southern California. These included trufﬂe fungi in the genera Hydnotryposis, Hydnotrya, and Tuber, as well as epigeous mushrooms such as Amanita, Boletus, Cortinarius, Laccaria, and Russula. Still, most studies underestimate EM diversity because many of these fungi fruit irregularly, and fungi with abundant sporocarps may not form functional EM  Gardes and Bruns 1996; Gehring et al. 1998 .  4 MYCORRHIZAL FUNCTION  4.1 Nutrient Uptake  Despite the differences in associations among mycorrhizal types, the function of all mycorrhizal systems depends on the ability of the fungal mycelium to absorb available inorganic or organic nutrients from the soil and translocate them to the host roots  Smith and Read 1997 . Hyphae outside the root may form an extensive network extending several centimeters from the root surface  Friese and Allen 1991 , enabling plants to obtain resources well beyond depletion zones  Nye and Tinker 1977  and to forage effectively for patchily distributed resources  Cui and Caldwell 1996 . Fine, highly branched hyphae increase the absorptive surface area of the root  Harley and Smith 1983; Rousseau et al. 1994 , produce enzymes for mineralization of nutrient sources that are normally unavailable to plants  Abuzinadah and Read 1986; Bauer et al. 2000 , and because of their extremely ﬁne diameter they are considerably less expensive than roots. As a result, mycorrhizal plants undergo physiological changes which include increased rates of growth and seed production, increased nutrient status, enhanced water uptake and drought tolerance, and improved resistance to plant pathogens.  4.2 Carbon Allocation  Arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi are obligate symbionts and must obtain carbon  C  from the host plant, whereas EM fungi  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   primarily uses host plant C. Yet, some taxa are capable of supplementing host C with supplies from the soil  Durall et al. 1994; Smith and Read 1997 . Studies have estimated that 10 – 85% of net photosynthate is allocated to mycorrhizal fungi depending on the ecosystem  Allen 1991 . Mycorrhizal plants consistently transfer more C belowground than nonmycorrhizal plants. Under low light or high nutrient conditions, mycorrhizae may suppress plant growth and the fungal partner has sometimes been considered a drain on the host  Johnson et al. 1997 . However, a number of studies have shown that photosynthetic rates are enhanced in mycorrhizal plants to compensate for the cost of mycorrhiza development, regardless of nutrient availability  Allen 1991 .  Mycorrhizal fungi are an important link in the chain of C transfer from plant to soil. We now realize the important role of mycorrhizae in sequestration of C in soil  Bonkowski et al. 2000; Rillig et al. 2001; Treseder and Allen 2000  and the potential for mycorrhizae to inﬂuence C cycling rates. Estimates of AM fungal biomass can account for 1 – 17% of the root weight  Fujiyoshi et al. 2000  and EM can comprise 20 – 30% of the root volume  Harley and McCready 1952 . Processes involved in the cycling of fungal C include production, survivorship, and decomposition rates of fungal tissue  Treseder and Allen 2000 . The production and turnover of ﬁne hyphal networks exceeds the turnover rates for both root and shoot material  Fitter et al. 2000 . However, a substantial amount of the C allocated to mycorrhizal tissue could remain in the soil for a longer period. Chitin, a recalcitrant polysaccharide, can constitute 60% of fungal cell walls and may persist years to decades in the soil. The functioning hyphal mycelium also secretes an insoluble glycoprotein called glomalin  Wright and Upadhyaya 1996  that sloughs from hyphae during the life span of root colonization  Wright and Upadhyaya 1999; Wright et al. 1996 . Glomalin is important in forming water-stable aggregates and in soil fertility; measurement of this protein concentration in soils will help with the comparison of soils of different compositions and or tillage or disruption practices  Wright and Upadhyaya 1996 . Because hyphal productivity varies among AM fungi, glomalin production also varies  17 mg mg hyphae – 63 mg mg hyphae   Wright et al. 1996 . Glomalin levels can be present in soil as high as 1.5% of the soil dry weight  Wright and Upadhyaya 1996  and constitute 30 – 60% of the recalcitrant carbon in undisturbed soils  Treseder and Allen 2000 . Carbon dating of glomalin indicates that turnover occurs at time scales of several years to decades, much longer than the turnover estimates for AM hyphae  Rillig et al. 2001 .  4.3 Soil Stabilization  In addition to direct beneﬁts of plant growth and health, the contribution of fungal mycelium to soil aggregation and soil organic matter development may be a critical component to most restoration programs  Miller and Jastrow 1991 . The role of fungi in enhancing soil stabilization is two-fold. First,  the extraradical hyphae of AM fungi, together with ﬁne roots, physically bind soil particles into larger macroaggregate units  Miller and Jastrow 1990 . Second, AM fungi channel a signiﬁcant amount of carbon into the soil by which soil particles and organic material become bound, contributing to soil aggregation and stability  Rillig et al. 1999 . Typically, there are between 1 – 20 m of AM hyphae g of soil  Sylvia 1990 . In cold deserts, Allen and MacMahon  1985  reported hyphal length of 2 – 6 m g of soil. Treseder and Allen  2001  reported similar values  2 – 4 m of live AM hyphae g of soil  in a chaparral ecosystem. In contrast, Miller et al.  1995  found that soils associated with mycotrophic plants in tallgrass prairie had 111 m cm3 and Allen and Allen  1988  reported that in Wyoming sagebrush steppe, AM fungi produced 28 – 54 m total hyphae g of soil. The signiﬁcant contribution of fungal hyphae to the formation of stable soil aggregates that prevent wind and water erosion which may be crucial to restoration success  Miller and Jastrow 1991  and carbon sequestration  Jastrow et al. 1996 .  5 MYCORRHIZAL RESPONSE TO  DISTURBANCE  The fundamental role of mycorrhizal fungal hyphae is to provide a direct physical link between the plant community and surrounding soil resources  Miller and Jastrow 1992 . Disturbance to soil systems always alter in some way the spatial heterogeneity between soil fungi and plants, organic matter, and nutrient pools  Allen and MacMahon 1985; Allen et al. 1999 . Major disturbances usually reduce mycorrhizal inoculum densities. Disturbance to hyphae can occur through compaction of soil pores or physical destruction of the hyphae  Allen and MacMahon 1985  and through vegetation removal or loss of plant cover. The impact of disturbance on mycorrhizal infectivity has been the topic of numerous studies  Jasper et al. 1989; Jasper et al. 1991; McGonigle et al. 1990 .  6 RECOVERY OF MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI  inﬂuential  The reestablishment of mycorrhizal fungi following disturb- ance has been extensively studied  Allen et al. 1999 . Factors that are most to the recovery of mycorrhizae include the dispersal of plant and fungal propagules, the physicochemical soil environment, and the survival of fungal residuals. Plant and fungal propagules typically disperse independently of one another and then must encounter each other in a suitable microsite favorable to their survival. Plant and fungal propagules arriving at that microsite must also be viable and germinable  Cooke and Whipps 1993 . Soil fertility, especially artiﬁcially high levels of available nitrogen  N  and P, could inhibit formation of mycorrhizae and slow the recovery of fungal propagules densities in soil. Therefore, survival of infective residual fungal propagules would greatly enhance mycorrhizal reestablishment  Allen and MacMahon 1985; Allen et al. 1992 .  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

In work undertaken by Miller et al.  1998 , EM fungi persisted on dying roots following ﬁres for over a year after the trees were dead: new seedling roots could tap this resource if it remains intact. Since most mycorrhizal fungi are present in the upper soil proﬁle, topsoil serves as a reservoir of fungal inoculum, as well as a hospitable environment for invading propagules. Therefore, the careful management of topsoil should alleviate the need for intense inoculation efforts after disturbance. For example, when possible, disturbance to soil should be minimized by limiting or eliminating activities that exacerbate the level of impact  Allen et al. 1999 . This allows mycorrhizae associated with plants and organic matter to stabilize soil and reduce erosion. It also protects intact hyphal networks that can rapidly form mycorrhizae on uncolonized roots of neighboring plants  Francis et al. 1986; Smith and Read 1997 . In situations where land is to be eventually disturbed, the most effective means to preserve mycorrhizae may include salvaging the topsoil before disturbance and respreading it afterwards or transferring it away from the site to another disturbed area  Allen et al. 1999 . Top-soiling can be a signiﬁcant source of microbes, plant propagules, and organic matter  Allen and Allen 1980 ; however, critical to the beneﬁts of top-soiling is the length of time, the soil spends without plant cover necessary to sustain symbiotic relation- ships. Soil may be stockpiled for several years, during which time organic matter  Schwenke et al. 2000 , chemical composition  Kundu and Ghose 1997 , and infectivity of mycorrhizal propagules can change greatly  Miller et al. 1985 . Even after soil reapplication, slow or poor seedling recruitment may further hinder mycorrhizal establishment. Planting a dense cover crop of the appropriate plants on soil stockpiles could enhance the survival and subsequent establishment of mycorrhizal fungi on restoration sites.  7.2 Soil Amendments  Improving the structure of soil organic matter is an important management option for enhancing mycorrhizal development  Allen et al. 1999 . Compost, bark, or some other recalcitrant carbon source provides a slow release of nutrients while increasing soil moisture, facilitating inﬁltration, and reducing soil compaction. These conditions are not only beneﬁcial to mycorrhizal fungi, but also many other microorganisms that improve nutrient availability and plant performance. For EM particularly, the absence of organic matter following severe disturbance limits the establishment of mycorrhizae despite adequate dispersal onto the site  Allen et al. 1992; Read 1984 . The use of soil amendments could therefore alleviate the need for further mycorrhizal inoculation.  The ability of mycorrhizal propagules to colonize disturbed sites from across relatively long distances supports the need to maintain source areas with diverse and abundant mycorrhizal populations. The natural recovery of mycorrhizae was ﬁrst presumed to be a limited process, relying heavily on the slow recolonization of plants and animals from disturbance edges. However, Allen et al.  1989 ; Warner et al.  1987  have demonstrated that both wind and animals can disperse AM spores quite rapidly and as far as 2 km across disturbed arid landscapes. On Mount St. Helens, wind rapidly dispersed EM inoculum, but animals were necessary for dispersal of AM  Allen et al. 1992 .  7.4 Managing Natural Reinvasion  Of the diverse array of AM and EM fungi that could potentially inhabit a site, relatively few are used to replace the hundreds that are lost with disturbance. Managing a site to facilitate natural reinvasion may therefore be critical to the restoration process. In arid habitats, mycorrhizal propagules are dispersed across sites by both wind and animals  Warner et al. 1987 . Evaluating and manipulating these two factors could potentially enhance the rate of mycorrhizal recovery. For example, Allen et al.  1989  found that wind dispersal and deposition patterns of fungal spores were predictable given an understanding of the physical and biological characteristics of a site. Knowing potential source and sink areas, it is possible to enhance the trapping of wind- blown propagules using artiﬁcial barriers such as snow fences or by manipulating the distances between individual plants thereby creating islands of fungal inoculum  Allen et al. 1997 .  Animal activity on disturbed sites is also important to mycorrhizal recovery. Animals disperse fungal propagules, either by directly feeding on them  Allen 1988; Allen et al. 1997; Blaschke and Ba¨umler 1989; Rabatin and Skinner 1985  or by moving soil and root material containing propagules  Allen and MacMahon 1988; Friese and Allen 1993 . Numerous animals consume the hypogeous fruiting bodies  trufﬂes  of some EM fungi and deposit these in new locations, a critical element to the reforestation of many habitats  Allen et al. 1997 . Pocket gopher  Thomomys talpoides  and harvester ant  Pogonomrymex occidentalis  move substantial amounts of soil, bringing spores, root fragments, and plant propagules to the surface  Allen et al. 1984 . Their mounds provide refuge and favorable microsite conditions for late-seral obligately mycorrhizal plant species  Allen 1987 . Interestingly, the dispersal of mycorrhizal propagules via animal activity could play an inﬂuential role in determining rates and patterns of plant reestablishment success.  the establishment of  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

Plants exhibit different degrees of mycotrophy, primarily based on their capacity for nutrient uptake and their growth response to fungal colonization. In early work by Stahl  1900 , plants were divided into nonmycotrophic, facultatively mycotrophic, and obligately mycotrophic categories, forming a continuum from the least to most responsive mycorrhizal fungi  Allen and Allen 1990 . Studies conducted along successional sequences have demonstrated that early-seral plant species are often nonmycorrhizal, followed by facultative and late-seral obligate species  Janos 1980 . Interestingly, many pioneer species and Amaranthaceae  Gerdemann 1968  are nonmycotrophic and persist on disturbed soils where mycorrhizal inoculum densities are low  Allen and Allen 1980 . For most restoration projects, the goal is to establish late-seral plant species in early-seral soils. The appropriate mycorrhizal association must be considered. Because mycorrhizae are generally adapted to local plant populations  Weinbaum et al. 1996 , using locally adapted seeds for the revegetation of a particular species could facilitate mycorrhiza formation. Transplanting mycorrhizal seedlings onto disturbed sites can quickly increase AM infectivity because fungal hyphae expand into open habitats and along roots, slowly spreading the association to adjacent plants  Warner and Mosse 1980 .  in the Chenopodiaceae, Brassicaceae,  Manipulating the spatial arrangement of transplants to concentrate resources and create resource islands may provide greater beneﬁts than less intensive treatments over a large area  Allen 1988; Allen and MacMahon 1985 . These resource islands can provide seed and inoculum for surrounding areas. Replanting multiple shrubs in a clumped pattern enhances mycorrhizal recovery by trapping more wind-carried propagules between plants than would be deposited around individually spaced plants  Allen et al. 1997 .  8 USE OF MYCORRHIZAL INOCULUM  8.1 When is it Appropriate?  Over the past three decades, there has been increasing interest in using mycorrhizal inoculation in large-scale plant production situations, including manipulating and managing the effectiveness of plant – fungus relationships  Miller et al. 1994 . Before the selection and culture of fungi begins, it should be determined that inoculation is more appropriate as a management option than manipulation of the native mycorrhizal population. Identifying whether a disturbed site would respond favorably to AM or EM inoculation is the ﬁrst step. This involves knowing the limitations to plant growth or establishment in a particular soil, and determining whether mycorrhizal fungi can alleviate those restrictions  Dodd and  Thomson 1994 . Large-scale disturbances always change soil characteristics, alter plant communities, and reduce mycor- rhizal abundance and diversity. Where native fungi have low colonization capacity, but provide beneﬁts to host plants, managing to increase the abundance of fungal populations may be more appropriate than augmenting with nonnative fungi  Dodd and Thomson 1994 . Most areas to be restored vary greatly from their predisturbance state. Native ecotypes may or may not be better adapted to the prevailing site conditions  Azco´n-Aguilar and Barea 1997 . Consequently, using nonnative mycorrhizae better adapted to the current environmental conditions is an important consideration. For instance, management for native populations of mycorrhizal fungi may not be appropriate where exotic trees are planted on disturbed sites. Dunstan et al.  1998  noted that the ﬁrst attempts to establish pine plantations, especially Pinus radiata, in Western Australia were large-scale failures, and it was not until inoculation with compatible EM fungi that pines were successfully introduced. Nevertheless, after 100 years of successive inoculation with exotic EM, the diversity of fungi colonizing roots of pines in plantations remains low, attributed to the host-speciﬁc nature of some EM fungi. Another important consideration for inoculating with mycorrhizal fungi is the ability of the symbiosis to reduce the use of fertilizers and pesticides. The use of fungi to reduce fertilizer and pesticide application has been achieved in plant production systems for agriculture, horticulture, and recently, ecosystem restoration  Azco´n-Aguilar and Barea 1997 . Maximum beneﬁts will only be obtained from careful selection and inoculation of compatible host-fungus – soil combinations  Azco´n-Aguilar and Barea 1997 .  8.2  Isolating and Culturing Fungi  Despite the beneﬁts of mycorrhizal associations, application has not been widely used on a commercial scale. For commercial development, large quantities of inoculum must be produced. Since AM are obligate biotrophs, they must be grown and maintained on living plant roots. This is often problematic because of the high risk of introducing plant pathogens and other contaminants into the culture system  Jarstfer and Sylvia 1997 . In contrast, EM fungi may grow on agar media in the absence of a host plant root or from the vegetative mycelium of fruiting bodies collected directly from the ﬁeld  Molina and Palmer 1982 .  The ﬁrst step in culturing mycorrhizal fungi is producing stock of the individual fungal isolate on host plant roots. For AM fungi, spores or colonized root fragments from the stock are used to produce larger quantities of inoculum for growth on soil-based or soil-free substrates  Schenck and Perez 1990 . Although large amounts of EM fungal spores can be easily collected in the ﬁeld, spores are rarely used to isolate EM fungi. Instead, many inoculation programs use the EM vegetative mycelium for its effective growth and storage on agar  Molina and Palmer 1982 .  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   There are several beneﬁts to using a soil-based culture system. Soil-based inocula are easy to produce, highly infective, and can be stored for several months or years. Jarstfer and Sylvia  1997  outline the most basic procedure for isolating and culturing spores on plants in sterile soil. Host plants propagated from seed are preferred over cuttings because they are easily disinfected. Disinfecting fungal propagules prior to inoculation is also critical because other microorganisms may be propagated with or instead of the AM fungi  Jarstfer and Sylvia 1997 . To avoid contamination, cultures should be isolated from nonsterile environments. Cultures are typically grown for 4 – 6 months, ensuring sporulation of all genera  Sieverding 1991 , and are then stored as air-dried soil at room temperature  Dodd and Thomson 1994 . Fungal inoculum can be stored for long periods  . 5 years  as air-dried soil; however, the viability of individual isolates during storage remains uncertain  Jarstfer and Sylvia 1997 . The most convenient use of soil-based systems has been for inoculating nursery grown plants that are later transplanted in the ﬁeld. This type of culture system may be otherwise too cumbersome for extensive use on a landscape-scale  Jarstfer and Sylvia 1997 .  Soil-free systems, like hydroponics and aeroponics, were developed to overcome the limitations and drawbacks associated with soil-based systems. Culturing fungi in soil- less media provides greater control over the physical and chemical characteristics of the growth medium and minimizes the detrimental impacts of contamination with other organisms  Jarstfer and Sylvia 1995 . As such, the ideal conditions conducive to AM development are capable of being achieved. Better control of nutrients in soil-less systems can result in greater root proliferation and higher numbers of spores per centimeter of colonized root length  Sharma et al. 2000 . Colonized roots and spores free of substrate allow for more efﬁcient production and distribution of inocula  Jarstfer and Sylvia 1997 . Consequently, soil-free systems produce greater propagule densities than soil-based pot cultures of the same age  Jarstfer and Sylvia 1995 . Aeroponic culture in particular allows for easy extraction of AM fungal propagules, and mycorrhizal roots can be sheared to produce high-density inoculum that is both efﬁcient and easy to handle  Jarstfer and Sylvia 1995 . Commercial nurseries currently use aeroponic culture systems for revegetation programs where on-site production of inocula allows for the use of fresh mycorrhizal propagules at optimal times  Jarstfer and Sylvia 1995 .  8.3  Inoculum Diversity  Inoculating with several AM or EM fungal isolates may be appropriate for reestablishing a range of mycotrophic plant species on a disturbed site, especially if plant diversity was high, prior to disturbance  Dodd and Thomson 1994 . Whether fungal inocula are native, exotic, or both depends largely on the host plant and environmental conditions. Mixed mycorrhizal inocula may ensure the persistence of inoculant  fungi in the ﬁeld after transplantation if several isolates were better adapted to conditions in the nursery, rather than extremes in the environment  Dodd and Thomson 1994 . Under most circumstances, attempts to increase mycorrhizal fungi in soil have involved inoculation with exotic fungal species  Miller et al. 1994 . Exotic fungi must outcompete native mycorrhizal populations, persist on roots, and colonize the root systems of neighboring hosts to be effective. Consequently, most exotic AM and EM fungi are eventually replaced with native mycorrhizae over time  Marx and Cordell 1987 . However, their importance to the initial stages of plant establishment is often critical.  8.4 Methods for Applying Inoculum  Most commercially available AM bulk inoculum is a mixture of spores, colonized roots, hyphae, and the substrate on which pot cultures were grown. For EM fungi, many inoculation programs have successfully used the EM vegetative mycelium. The production of mycelial inoculum for large- scale inoculation programs is often costly and pure culture isolates can be difﬁcult to maintain  Marx and Kenney 1982 . In contrast, EM sporocarps contain a signiﬁcant amount of spores that can be collected from the fruiting populations and easily dried and stored until application. Spores from EM fruiting bodies of Pisolithus, Scleroderma, and Rhizopogon are most frequently used as inoculum. Spores of Laccaria, Descolea, Scleroderma and Pisolithus spp. have recently been proposed as candidates for nursery inoculation programs for eucalypti  Lu et al. 1998  and Rhizopogon spp. are commonly used to inoculate Doulgas-ﬁr seedlings in commercial nurseries  Castellano 1994 .  The amount,  timing, and method of inoculation are important factors in properly managing the establishment of mycorrhizae. Little is known about appropriate application rates. Estimates of 1 – 2 kg of bulk soil inoculum  5000 – 10,000 propagules  have been used for AM inocu- lations  Lovato et al. 1995  and spore suspensions at densities of 106 – 107 spores per ml have been used for EM inoculations  Lu et al. 1998 . The earlier plants are inoculated with fungi, the greater the beneﬁts are to those plants. Inoculation is typically applied in either by broadcasting at the soil surface or by banding inoculum at the root zone. Broadcasting requires more inoculum whereas banding concentrates inoculum near the area of developing roots. Transplanting mycorrhizal seedlings can also be used to inoculate other plant roots. Fungal hyphae expand into open habitats and along roots, slowly spreading the association to adjacent plants  Warner and Mosse 1980 .  9 MYCORRHIZAE AND BIOREMEDIATION  In the mining process, not only plants are removed, but also upon soil replacement changes in texture and deposits of salts and heavy metals often result  Allen 1989 . The toxicity of  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   metals not only depends on their concentration in the soil, but also their availability and transfer to plants. By providing a direct link between soil and plants, mycorrhizal function could be of great importance in heavy metal polluted soils  Leyval et al. 1997 . As such, there is increasing interest in the potential for mycorrhizal fungi to be used as bioremediation agents or as bioindicators of heavy metal pollution.  It is generally believed that pollution inhibits the formation of mycorrhizal associations. However, little is known about the viability and activity of AM and EM fungi in soils with different heavy metal concentrations. Ru¨hling and So¨derstro¨m  1990  reported that the number of fruiting bodies and species decreased with increasing pollution along a heavy metal pollution gradient in Sweden. Isolates of P. tinctorius collected from old mining sites expressed increased aluminum tolerance and high mycelial growth when compared to isolates from rehabilitated and forested sites  Egerton-Warburton and Grifﬁn 1995 . For AM fungi, there is evidence to suggesting that at least some AM fungi are relatively resistant to high metal concentration. Gildon and Tinker  1981  reported that plant roots growing naturally on zinc- and cadmium-contaminated soils had signiﬁcant AM colonization. Davies et al.  2001  reported high rates of AM colonization even at the most toxic levels of chromium in soils. And Rao and Tak  2001  found a signiﬁcant improvement in root colonization and spore density of AM fungi isolated from gypsum mine spoils when used to inoculate ﬁve tree species growing in gypsum mine soils.  The mechanism that confers heavy metal tolerance in mycorrhizal fungi is largely unknown. The survival of AM and EM fungi in polluted soil may depend heavily on the density of the external hyphae. The absorption of heavy metals to the hyphal surface could reduce soil concentrations and thus accumulation of fungal and plant tissue  Denny and Wilkins 1987; Marschner and Dell 1994 . Components of the fungal cell wall, such as chitin and melanin, can bind heavy metals to the extraradical mycelium  Denny and Wilkins 1987; Tam 1995 . Turnau et al.  1996  found that the EM fungal mantle contained the highest levels of heavy metals while the Hartig net contained the lowest levels. Glomalin, the glycoprotein that coats AM fungal hyphae, could play an equally important role in protecting AM fungi and host plants from toxic metal concentrations in soils, although this has not yet been investigated. Other possible mechanisms conferring heavy metal tolerance in fungi may include intracellular chelation  Martin et al. 1994  and the sequestration of metals within mycorrhizal sheaths  Egerton-Warburton et al. 1993 . The stability of metal tolerance in both AM and EM fungi remains to be examined  Leyval et al. 1997 . Despite these uncertainties, isolation of tolerant fungal ecotypes that occur on polluted soils could have important application to the revegetation or inoculation of barren polluted sites  Gildon and Tinker 1981; Rao and Tak 2001 .  The beneﬁt of heavy metal tolerance in mycorrhizal fungi could have direct effects on host plant response to metal concentrations in soil  Meharg and Cairney 2000 . Several studies have reported the beneﬁcial role of EM associations in  reducing metal concentrations in plant tissues.  Colpaert and Van Assche 1992;1993; Dixon and Buschena 1988 . Ectomycorrhizal fungi can differ in their ability to reduce translocation from root to shoot, so the presence of the appropriate EM fungi may be critical  Denny and Wilkins 1987 . The role of AM fungi in heavy metal uptake is harder to elucidate because of the obligate nature of the fungal symbiont. Regardless of their ability to grow in polluted soils, the extent to which AM fungi confer metal tolerance in their host plants, or accumulate heavy metals in roots preventing translocation to shoots is not fully understood  Leyval et al. 1997 . Species of both AM and EM fungi differ in hyphal productivity and in their ability to take up and transfer metals. The turnover of fungal tissue could be an important factor in the ability of mycorrhizal fungi to protect host plants against prolonged elevated metal concentrations  Colpaert and Van Assche 1993 .  10 MYCORRHIZAE AND BIOTECHNOLOGY  Despite the promise  Wood and Cummings 1992; Podila and Douds 2000 , there has been remarkably little real break- through in using mycorrhizae for applied activities, beyond the early work of inoculation for nutrient enhancement. Technologies for inoculation are available  Brundrett et al. 1996 , but selection for desirable characteristics and matching plant and fungal genotypes may prove to be crucial. In many cases, if not most, agricultural technologies actually select for populations of fungi that may be detrimental for the crops grown  Johnson et al. 1997 . Many of the EM and virtually all of AM fungi are generalists, with the ability to invade a wide range of host plants, but with highly variable response variables  Johnson et al. 1997 . Bever et al.  2001  have shown how less-than-optimal taxa can persist in a population and even come to dominate.  Large investments are being made in developing trans- genic crops. However, no efforts are underway to even determine if compatibilities or response matches are even important! Kaldorf et al.  2001  have shown that genetically- modiﬁed hybrid aspen showed no differences from non- transgenic races in AM or EM infection, and only marginal changes in the fungal community composition were observed. We have also found that transgenic corn had no effect on the species composition or AM infection  Snyder and Allen, unpublished data . Hiremath and Podila  2000  reviewed efforts that demonstrate that genetic transformations of mycorrhizal fungi are possible. Certainly, genes are rapidly being identiﬁed and studied  Maldonado-Mendoza et al. 2001  and genes can be added to individual fungi. However, to our knowledge, no transgenic mycorrhizal fungi have been successfully tested and no effects of differing fungi on host responses, either positive or negative, have been evaluated.  This remains an important area of study. Experiences with fungal virus’ have shown that extranuclear genetic material can dramatically affect fungal-plant interactions  Roane et al.  Copyright 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   1986  and mycorrhizal fungi are no different from others in this trait  Douhan et al. 2003 .  11 CONCLUSION  Mycorrhizal fungi are virtually ubiquitous in their evolution- ary associations with plants. All trees used for fuel, ﬁber, and food form mycorrhizae with a diverse array of fungi. All crops, excepting a small number of annuals, and all horticultural plants that decorate our homes and gardens form mycorrhizae. Known beneﬁts range from soil stabili- za?show $132>tion, to fertilizer and pesticide reduction, to enhanced tolerance of pollutants. These fungi also sequester toxins and could be extremely important in land rehabilitation as well as restoration of lands for grazing or conservation.  it  the appropriate fungi present,  Disturbance to plant communities and soil systems can reduce the density, infectivity, and function of mycorrhizae. Without the natural re-establishment of this beneﬁcial symbiosis may take decades or may never occur. Because of the inﬂuential role mycorrhizae play in facilitating plant succession, is important to understand the factors that regulate mycorrhizal recovery, and to determine how to effectively manage those factors to enhance existing or inoculated fungal populations. For instance, if a disturbance can be anticipated, topsoil preservation could minimize adverse effects to mycorrhizal fungi. If topsoil is lost, or if soil structure is severely altered, soil organic amendments could potentially enhance mycor- rhizal development. The ability of mycorrhizal propagules to colonize disturbed sites from across relatively long distances supports the need to maintain source areas with diverse and abundant mycorrhizal populations. In natural disturbances, mycorrhizal propagules disperse by wind and animals. Evaluating host plant characteristics or manipulating the spatial pattern of planting with respect to these two factors can enhance the rate of mycorrhizal recovery  Allen et al. 1997 . Managing a site to facilitate native fungal reinvasion may be less effective if the area varies greatly from its predisturbance state. Native ecotypes may or may not be better adapted to the prevailing site conditions. For instance, in soils polluted by heavy metals, the survival of mycorrhizal fungi could make them important bioindicators. Their ability to function in heavy metal polluted soils may also confer some degree of tolerance in host plants. In contrast, if native ecotypes are particularly sensitive to changes in the soil environment, inoculating with nonnative mycorrhizae better adapted to the current soil conditions is an important consideration. It should, however, ﬁrst be determined whether the disturbed site would respond favorably to AM or EM inoculation. This involves knowing the limitations of plants and mycorrhizae in particular soils. Actively restoring the mycorrhizal fungal community is an essential component to the success of any restoration program.  The value of mycorrhizal symbioses has been documented for over a century. However, application of mycorrhizae in current biotechnology techniques remain as ignorant as  agronomic and horticultural enterprises that developed practices that reduced or eliminated mycorrhizal beneﬁts in an oversimpliﬁed view of the dynamics of soil systems. Mycorrhizal fungi are being studied at the molecular to biochemical level. However, tapping the vast diversity of increasing yield fungi and alternative mechanisms for efﬁciencies, decreasing pest rendering polluted landscapes usable has not been studied or extensively utilized. More applied research, especially in developing areas of the world without the ﬁnancial resources to purchase energy, pesticides, or fertilizers, would pay large dividends.  loss, or  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT  This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. DEB-9981548.
