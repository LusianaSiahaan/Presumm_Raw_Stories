[ 4 ]   1  Introduction  Magento is an open source e-commerce system that runs on most web-hosting  services. It is one of the most powerful, flexible, and customizable e-commerce   systems at your disposal. It is also the fastest-growing e-commerce system available   on the market.  Magento offers you an extensive suite of powerful tools for creating and managing an online  store. As your online store grows, you can be sure that this robust e-commerce system will  handle your needs. However, getting started with Magento can be difficult without the right  guidance. This book provides that guidance in the form of a step-by-step approach to build   a simple and effective online store. As you follow along with the guided lessons, you will   see how an online coffee store is created from the ground up. This book will do more than  just show you what you need to do when you build your store. We will discuss why we  choose certain options and how to make the best decisions when faced with Magento's  many options.  This step-by-step beginner's guide takes the pain out of using the world's best open source  e-commerce solution. It guides you through installing the software, configuring your store,  populating your store with products, accepting payments, maintaining relationships with  your customers, and fulfilling orders.  The scope of this book  This book is a step-by-step guide to getting a basic store up and running as quickly as  possible. We will use a fraction of Magento's features. However, we will cover all of the  features that you need to roll out your store. By the time you finish this book, you will have  a store that presents products singly and in groups, makes products easy to find, suggests  related products, accepts a variety of payments, informs customers of the status of their  orders, and more.   Introduction  Beyond this book Magento enables you to create several stores that you can control from the same  administrative interface. For example, you could have a discount store, a retail store,  and a wholesale store—all controlled from the same Magento installation. To make the  administration even easier, these stores can share payment and customer information.  Although multiple storefronts are beyond the scope of this book, what you learn about  setting up a single store will be applicable to any storefronts that you decide to add later.  Although Magento enables you to accept payment in multiple currencies, this book shows  you how to create a store that accepts a single currency. However, the payment methods  that you set up for the single currency can also be used for multiple currencies if you decide  to expand your store in that direction.  This book shows you how to sell products in groups and how to display related products  when a shopper is looking at a product. Magento also offers you the ability to create   up-sells for your products. The procedures that you will learn to create related products   are very similar to the procedures required to create up-sells.  The look and feel of your storefront can be customized in detail. You can customize the  layout, color scheme, icons, graphic elements, and text of your storefront. You can display  featured products on any page. You can install entirely new themes to change the look and  feel of your store for a season, or whenever you want.  In this book you will learn how to customize the default Magento storefront just enough   so that it becomes your store. You will learn about Magento's directory structure and where  some of the elements of a store are customized. This experience will help you if you decide  to go beyond this book and install new themes, or create your own themes.  Time for action: Tour the demo store Before we start creating our demonstration store, let's take a tour of how the store will look  like. We will look at some of the features that we will learn to use in this book.  1.   The front page of our demo store has been slightly customized from the   default Magento installation. We changed it a bit to get rid of the standard   Magento appearance.  [ 6 ]   Chapter 1  Notice the logo in the upper left corner. We will learn how to customize this   in Chapter 6. We will also learn how to customize the welcome message in the   upper right corner, the content of the main area of this page, and the callout in   the right column. The links in the upper right corner  My Account, My Wishlist...Log In  are standard  Magento features. We will leave them as they are in our installation. You can see product categories across the top of the page  Blended, Single   Origin... Coffee Accessories . We will learn how to put products into categories   and subcategories, making them easier for your shoppers to find.  [ 7 ]   Introduction  2.   Now, let's look at one of these category pages:  The callout from the front page is displayed in the right column again. There is also   a customized callout in the left column: Not sure what to order? Notice that the customer can now filter the products in this category by several   options: Caffeine, Character, and Price. These are called Attributes. You will learn  how to create custom Attributes for your products. You will then learn how to make  your custom and Magento's built-in Attributes show up in the navigation menu.     [ 8 ]   3.   Let's look at the page for an individual product:  Chapter 1  This product is actually a group of products presented together on the same page.  When the customer clicks on the Add to Cart button, all three products in this group  get added to the Shopping Cart at once. This is an example of a Grouped Product.  This is useful for items that are usually sold as sets, such as a suit  jacket plus pants   or a dining room set  table plus chairs .  [ 9 ]   Introduction  4.   Let's look at the checkout process next:  Notice that the checkout page is divided into five tabs: Billing Information through  Order Review. All of these tabs are on the same page. This makes it easy for the  customer to navigate from one part of the checkout process to the other. Also,   notice the Checkout Progress in the right column. The customer always knows   exactly where  s he is in the checkout process. This is Magento's one-page   checkout, and it is a standard feature. In the previous screenshot, you can see that we are offering the customer a choice  of shipping options. The top-two options use United Parcel Service. You will learn  how to make Magento interface with shipping providers, so that it can look up the  charges for various types of shipping from those providers. The third option doesn't  state a specific shipper. However, it does state that shipping charges are based on  the order total. You will also learn how to create shipping tables that calculate   shipping charges based on an order's destination, weight, and total.  [ 10 ]   5.   Now, let's look at the payment part of the checkout page:  Chapter 1     On this page, we give the customer several options for payment. You will learn   how to configure Magento to accept payments from Paypal, Check Money Order,  Authorize.net, and Credit Card saved  information. To keep your customers informed about the progress of their orders, you can   generate invoices and shipping notices from Magento. The following is an example  of an invoice generated for a customer:  [ 11 ]   Introduction  6.   This is just a sample of the features that we will work with as we build our store   with Magento.  What just happened? This tour introduced you to Magento's basic features. There is much more that you can   do with Magento. The features we demonstrated here are the minimum requirements to  make a Magento storefront functional. To make the store's appearance and organization  yours, you need to:                          Add products Categorize products Create a navigation menu Configure payment options Configure shipping options Configure taxes Customize the front page Process orders  Summary  In the chapters that follow, we will work in detail with the basic features we saw in this  chapter. When we finish, we will have an attractive, functional, and professional storefront.  The next chapter deals with Magento installation.  [ 12 ]   2Installation  Some hosting companies will install Magento for you, or have a one-click  installation for Magento. However, most users will find themselves installing  Magento. The process is not any more difficult than most installations of   php-based software. However, there are a few points that you must pay   close attention to.  This chapter is written especially for you, if you are:                 Installing Magento on your own Using a low-cost, commonly available hosting service Familiar with putting files up on a web server, but that is the limit of your   technical knowledge Willing to ask your hosting service's technical support some simple and specific   "Yes No" questions about their setup Eager to get your store up and running as fast as possible  Even if you own a server, or are very technical, this chapter is still worth reading. It can   save you time by helping you to avoid problems while installing Magento.   Installation  System requirements  You must install Magento on a web server. There are many kinds of web servers, but  Magento is designed to run best in a LAMP environment: Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. It  will run on Windows instead of Linux, but with some known issues that the official Magento  site discusses. There are many low-cost hosting services that offer all the requirements for a  successful Magento installation. Therefore, there is almost no excuse to settle for a service  that is missing any of the requirements.  A list of requirements Here is a short list of what your hosting service must provide. We'll discuss each of these  items later.  Requirement Linux  Apache web server  PHP 5.2.0 or newer  Notes Your web server should run Linux. Other Unix-operating systems  will also work, as will Windows. However, Linux is so popular among  hosting services that you shouldn't settle for anything less than your  exact requirement. As of this writing, the Apache web server is up to version 2.2. However,  many hosting services still use the proven, reliable version 1.3. Either  will work with Magento. PHP is a scripting language  a type of programming language .   PHP is especially suited for web development. PHP code can be  embedded into HTML pages to transform a static web page into  something dynamic.  Magento is written in PHP. It is built on the Zend Framework, which  means it uses Zend's library. If you want to customize Magento code,  you should know not only PHP, but also something about Zend.  You can take special steps to install Magento on a web server that has  only PHP version 4. However, so many hosting services have moved to  PHP 5+ that you should not settle for less.  [ 14 ]   Requirement PHP should have the  following extensions   and add-ons:  Notes PHP's abilities can be increased with extensions and add-ons. The ones  listed here are used by Magento, so your hosting service needs to have  them installed like almost all hosting services do.  Chapter 2    PDO MySQL    mcrypt    hash    simplexml    GD    DOM    iconv MySQL 4.1.20 or newer  An SMTP server  The easiest way to find out if your hosting service has the version   and extensions you need is to ask their technical support department.  However, if you want to obtain this information yourself, and you can  upload a page to your host  maybe you're already a customer, or are   on a trial period , see the next section.  If you are setting up a localhost to try Magento, you might be using  WAMP from the Apache Friends project. If so, you will also need to  install the CURL library.  MySQL is the world's most popular open source database. As of this  writing, MySQL is up to version 5.1. Most likely any hosting service   you are considering will offer a recent enough version for Magento. SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. Most email systems  use SMTP to send messages from one server to another. When  Magento needs to send an email  such as an order confirmation ,   it connects to your host's SMTP server and the server sends the   email on Magento's behalf.  Magento can also use a program called Sendmail to send emails.  However, only a few hosts offer Sendmail. As almost all hosts offer  SMTP, this chapter will deal with SMTP.  Many hosting services advertise LAMP, which covers four of the previous six requirements.  Also, a list of their features will show you that they offer SMTP. That covers five of the six  requirements. What about the PHP extensions? As stated in the table, the easiest way to  find out if your hosting service offers the PHP extensions is to ask the technical support  department. However, if you'd like to see for yourself, use the technique covered in the   next section.  [ 15 ]   Installation  Determining which PHP version and extensions your web   server has You can see your server's PHP information by uploading and displaying a web page that has  the phpinfo function.  Create a web page that has just these lines in it, and nothing else:  <?php  phpinfo  ; ?>  Save the file using any name you want, as long as it ends with .php, for example   phpinfo.php.  Point your browser to the page you just created. For example, I pointed my browser   to http:  www.brew-me-a-cup.com phpinfo.php. The page will look like the   following screenshot:  [ 16 ]  .   As you scroll down the page, you will see the names of the PHP extensions that have been  installed. For example, as you scroll down you will see a section for the DOM extension,  which confirms that this extension is installed and working.  Chapter 2  Keep scrolling until you find all the extensions listed in the table of the previous screenshot.  Conversely, you can also scroll down to verify that an extension has not been installed on the  server. To make it easier to find the extensions, you can search the page for their names. In  Firefox, you can use Edit  Find, and in Internet Explorer you can use Edit  Find on This Page.  Do you have Apache's mod_rewrite and SSL? Before proceeding with the installation, or even before choosing a hosting service, check  with the hosting service to see if they have mod_rewrite installed and what it costs to  obtain an SSL certificate. Both are explained in the sections that follow.  mod_rewrite makes user-friendly URLs Compare these two URLs:  http:  williamrice.com node 267393?article=123&abc  http:  williamrice.com magazine how-to-sell-more-coffee  They could both point to the same page. However, the second URL is easier for the user   to understand and remember. It enables the user to see where  s he is on your site    reading and article from the magazine section . Also, this link is easier to send in an email,  and doesn't break in the Favorites or Bookmarks function of your browser. Lastly, search  engines usually give better ranking to URLs that do not contain special characters, such as ?  and &, and keywords that describe the content of the page.  [ 17 ]   Installation  Magento tends to create URLs like the first one. However, if your hosting service has   an Apache module called mod_rewrite installed, then you can tell Magento to create  friendly URLs like the second one. Check with your hosting service before you begin the  Magento installation.  Do you need SSL? SSL is the standard for secure transactions on the Web. SSL encrypts data—such as   credit card numbers—as it travels between your browser and the site you are using.   This prevents thieves from stealing that data. When you're on a page protected by SSL,   its URL begins with https:  .  Your browser alone cannot secure the transaction. The web site needs an SSL certificate.   The SSL certificate does two things. First, it encrypts the data traveling between the site   and your browser. Second, it helps to prove that the site actually belongs to the person   who claims to own it.  Obtaining an SSL certificate is beyond the scope of this manual. However, many hosting  services will add it to your account for a fee. This means you can just "upgrade" your   service to an SSL certificate.  You don't need to decide on using SSL before installing Magento. You can install and  configure your online store, and then add SSL later. Also, if you are using a third party such   as PayPal, Authorize.net, or Google Checkout to process your payments, then payments will  happen on their web site and not yours. They will use their SSL certificate, and you do not  need it to protect your customer's credit card accounts.  Give this some serious consideration. Using SSL makes your site more secure. It also might  make some people more comfortable about buying from your online store. Sometimes an  increase in trust leads to an increase in business. Do your research, and decide if the extra  expense is worth the potential increase in business.  Installing Magento  After you confirm that your web host meets the requirements for Magento, you are ready   to install the software. The major steps for installing Magento are listed as follows:  1.  2.  3.  4.   http:  www.magentocommerce.com.  Download Magento from  Upload Magento to your web host. Set rights for some of Magento's directories and files. Create a MySQL database and database user for Magento.  [ 18 ]   Chapter 2  5.  6.   Point your browser to the Magento directory and step through the installation wizard. Test the frontend and backend of your Magento site.  After that, you're ready to start with creating your online store! Each of these major steps is  covered in the subsections that follow.  Time for action: Downloading Magento In this section we will download and decompress the Magento files.  1.   Getting the Magento files Point your browser to http:  www.magentocommerce.com download.   You will see a page like this:  The Magento team provides sample data that we can use if we want to play with   Magento. This sample data includes product images and information that will appear  on your site. Note that if we want to use this sample data, we must download and  install it before we install the Magento software. In the next chapter, we will add   our own products to Magento. Therefore, we will not need the sample data; we   will create our store with our own data.  [ 19 ]   Installation  You can download Magento in several different formats. All of these   formats—.zip, .gz, and .bz2—are just different ways of compressing   files so that they occupy less space.  I chose to download the .zip file and save it to my local hard drive. Notice that   I did not choose to decompress  that is, to unzip  the file. Choosing that option  would decompress the file while it's getting downloaded. Instead, I saved the   .zip file intact to my computer:  [ 20 ]   Chapter 2  2.   I'll decompress the file later. However, I want the original ZIP file on my local hard  drive, just in case I need it again. And, I have found that compressed files usually  download faster and more reliably when you save them intact and decompress   them after downloading, instead of decompressing them while they download. Decompressing the Magento archive I chose to download the .zip file because Mac OS X and Windows XP Vista have   built-in support for opening compressed .zip archives. Also, many Linux distributions,  such as Ubuntu, have built-in support for .zip archives. The next step is to decompress the .zip archive. In Windows, you can right-click   on the file and select Extract All, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 21 ]   Installation  On Mac OS X, you can right-click or Control-click on the file and select Open With   Archive Utility like this:  The result should be a folder on your local hard drive called magento, with   subfolders that you will upload:  In the next step you will upload these folders to your site. But before you do that,   let me explain why you decompressed the Magento archive on your   local hard drive. Many web hosts enable you to decompress a ZIP file that you upload to the host.   For example, using the popular Control Panel software, I uploaded the Magento   ZIP file to a web host.  [ 22 ]   Chapter 2  I then selected the .zip file.  [ 23 ]   Installation  The host then offered to unzip the file for me. This capability is a part of most web  hosting services.  The result is a subdirectory on my web site called magento, with all of the Magento  files placed inside.  [ 24 ]   Chapter 2  Again, it unzipped the files into a subdirectory, not the root directory of   my web site. That meant when customers access my storefront, they would   go to http:  williamrice.com magento. However, I want my customers   to simply go to http:  williamrice.com. To do this, I would need to unzip the files on my local computer and upload them,   so that I can control which directory they appear in. I don't want the ZIP file to   create a subdirectory for Magento. Instead, I want to place the Magento files in  the root directory of my site. That's why I unzip the file on my local computer and  upload the individual files to my site.  What just happened? At this point, you have all of the Magento files on your computer ready to be uploaded to your  web host. The files are unzipped, so you can see how the files are organized into folders.  Time for action: Uploading Magento to your web host  1.  Upload the unzipped files from the magento folder to your web host. I used a   2.   freeware FTP client called WinSCP, which you can get from http:  winscp.net. Notice that I uploaded the files to the root directory of  com, so that visitors see my storefront as soon as they come to the site.  http:  brew-me-a-cup.  [ 25 ]   Installation  3.   The following is a screenshot of the store's root directory after all the Magento files  have been uploaded:  4.   If you're installing Magento on a localhost, then the root directory will be the  htdocs folder. On my localhost, I used XAMPP from Apache Friends to run Apache,  MySQL, and PHP. In the xampp folder, the folder htdocs holds my web files:  [ 26 ]   Chapter 2  5.   When I run Magento on my localhost, I will point my web browser to   http:  localhost brew-me-a-cup.com.  What just happened? The Magento files now reside in you web host. If you're running Magento on a local host,   the files now reside in the htdocs directory.  Setting rights  permissions  for some of Magento's  directories and files  I am assuming that you are installing Magento on a Linux host because that is the  recommended method. On a Linux host, every directory and file has a set of permissions.   In the next three subsections, let's go over the basics of file permissions in Linux. Then,   we will set the correct file permissions for our Magento files.  About owners and groups A Linux web host almost always has multiple users. This is called a shared host because users  share the computer's resources.  [ 27 ]   Installation  Every user will belong to one or more group s . A group enables the administrator of that  computer to manage a group of users at once. For example, suppose all customers using  the computer as a web server are in a group called Webusers. Also, suppose the company  that owns the server decides to increase the amount of space they give to each of their  customers. Then, the administrator of the computer can increase the space for all the  customers at once, just by increasing the space for the group Webusers. As a customer   of a shared hosting service, you will be in a user group.  On a Linux host, every file and directory has an owner. The owner is one of the users on   that computer. For example, you are the owner of the files that you upload to the host.   Every file also belongs to a group. In the following screenshot, you can see that brewmaster  is the owner of all files and directories that were uploaded to the store's directory. You can  also see that all of the files and directories belong to a group called pg1404808. The name   of that group doesn't mean anything to you as a user. It was assigned by the hosting service.  About rights In the previous screenshot, you may have noticed the column labeled Rights. This column  tells you what the user, group, and other users on the server are allowed to do with a file.  For example, look at the directory 404. Notice that there are nine characters in the Rights  column for that directory: rwxr-xr-x. The first three characters tell you what the owner is  allowed to do with this directory or file. The next three tell you what the group is allowed  to do. The last three tell you what other users on this server are allowed to do with the  directory or file. So, the rights can be broken down like this:  [ 28 ]   Chapter 2  owner: rwx, group: r-x, and other users: r-x  The rwx tells you that the owner of this directory, brewmaster, is allowed to read, write, and  execute this directory. After that, the r-x tells you that the group to which this file belongs,  pg1404808, is allowed to read and execute this directory. However, the group cannot write  this directory, which means it cannot edit, rename, or delete it. Lastly, the second r-x tells  you that other users on this computer can also read and execute the directory.  Using numbers  octals  to state permissions As you saw, you can use a series of nine letters to express the rights that a directory or file  has. The example we used was the directory 404, which has the rights rwxr-xr-x. You can  also express the rights for a file or directory using a three-digit number. In the following  screenshot, look at the field labelled Octal and note the number 755 in that field:  When you set permissions for a file, you will use your FTP application or web host's control  panel to specify those permissions. In this case, you can see that the FTP application I use,  WinSCP, enables me to state the file permissions as either letters  rwxr-xr-x , or as a number   755 . Not every application gives you both options. Some applications force you to specify  file permissions using letters, while others force you to use a number. Therefore, you should  know how to express file permissions using both.  [ 29 ]   Installation  Let's look at this example again. We can see that the file permissions rwxr-xr-x are equivalent  to the file permissions 755. So, we can deduce the following:  rwx = 7 r-x = 5      Here is the complete list of permissions expressed in both letters and numbers. Remember  that the permissions for a file or directory will consist of three sets of these rights—one for  the owner, one for the group, and one for all other users:  Letters - - x - w -  Number Meaning 1 2  The user can execute the file, but cannot read or write it The user can write  change, rename, and delete  the file, but cannot read  or execute it The user can write and execute the file, but cannot read it The user can only read the file The user can read and execute the file, but cannot write  change, rename,  and delete  it The user can read and write the file, but cannot execute it The user can do anything with the file  - w x r - - r – x  r w - r w x  3 4 5  6 7  In the following screenshot, I am setting the permissions for the file index.html on my web  site. I am using the web-based control panel provided by my hosting service. Notice that   I must specify the permissions using numbers. Also, notice that this control panel allows me  to choose only some permissions. For example, they do not allow the permission 777, which  would allow anyone who gains access to the host complete control of that file.  Now that you have learned a little about file permissions on a Linux server, you know that:        A Linux host usually has many users Every file and directory has an owner and belongs to a group  [ 30 ]   Chapter 2              For every file and directory, there is a set of permissions that specify what the  owner, group, and all other users of that server can do with the file or directory You are concerned mostly with what an owner and all others can do with a file The permissions for a file or directory can be expressed as nine letters  three groups  of three , or as three digits You will use your FTP application, or the web-based control panel provided by your  hosting service, to set file and directory permissions  Let's move on and set the proper permissions for Magento's files and directories.  Time for action: Setting the rights  1.   Using your FTP program, or your hosting service's web-based control panel, set the  permissions for the following files and directories to rwxrwxrwx, or 777:                file    directory    var .htaccess  app etc  var   another directory  All the directories under    media  Notice that you are changing the permissions for the directories and all of the files  under those directories. This is called making the permissions recursive. You might  see that option in the FTP application when you set these permissions. With my FTP application, I set permissions by right-clicking on the file or folder and  selecting Properties from the pop-up menu, as shown in the following screenshot:  2.   [ 31 ]   Installation  3.   In the resulting window, I can set permissions using letters or numbers:  4.  Remember to make the permissions recursive.  If you are installing Magento on a Windows PC, you don't need to set permissions.  However, you will need to set permissions when you move your Magento installation  from your Windows PC to a Linux host.  What just happened? If you installed Magento on a Linux host, the permissions for the files should now be set.  Files that the public  your users  should not be able to access or change are now protected.  Time for action : Creating a database and database user In this step, we will create a MySQL database where Magento will store the information that  you add about your products, transactions, and customer information. We will also create  a username and password for that database. Later, we will enter the database's name,  location, username, and password into Magento. This will enable Magento to connect to  that database.  [ 32 ]   Chapter 2  The process for creating a database and user varies by the hosting service. I will show   a method that is common to many hosting services. However, you should always check   with your hosting service before proceeding with this step.  Using cPanel to create a database and a database user  1.  Like many hosting services, the one I use for this demonstration offers the cPanel  control panel. cPanel is web-based, so you don't need to install anything on your  computer to use it. Using your web browser, you just log into your hosting service  using the username and password they provide to you. From the cPanel  Home Page, I select MySQL Databases.  2.   3.   Then, I enter the name of the database and click on the   Create button.  [ 33 ]   Installation  4.  The previous screenshot contains some very important information that I will    need later. For Magento to connect to this database, it must know:  5.            Where to find the MySQL host The name of the database The username and password of a user who has access to   that database  6.   7.   localhost: tmp mysql5.sock. This is where   Notice the name of the MySQL host,  an application that is located on the same server will find the MySQL host. It is one  of the parameters that I will enter into Magento. I will also need the name of the  database—in this case, magento. Now, I will create a user for this database. I've selected  and I will give that user all privileges on that database:  magento as the username,   8.   Using cPanel, this is all I need to create a database and a database user for Magento.  Using DreamHost to create a database and a database user  1.   2.   I will also demonstrate creating a database and a database user on a hosting service  that does not use cPanel. This demonstration is done on http:  www.dreamhost. com . This is not an endorsement of their hosting service. I chose them for this  demonstration because their process is different from most, and thus offers a different  perspective on this task. You will see that even though the keystrokes and clicks are  very different, the basic principles are the same. On the previous hosting service, the MySQL host name was assigned by the hosting  service. On DreamHost, I create a MySQL host name. See the field New Hostname in  the following screenshot:  [ 34 ]   Chapter 2  3.   4.   In this case, I called the MySQL host mysql. I must create the MySQL host on a  domain that I own, and so I used brew-me-a-cup.com. The result is that when I  enter the database host name into Magento, I will enter mysql.brew-me-a-cup.com. I also specify the database name, user, and password in this screen. That part is the  same as the previous hosting service.  [ 35 ]   Installation  5.   Here is the confirmation message for creating this database:  Localhost  1.   If you are installing Magento on a localhost, you can probably use phpMyAdmin  to create the database and user. For example, XAMPP and WAMP both include  phpMyAdmin in their products. This process is well-documented at many web sites.  What just happened? From the examples that we discussed, you can see that creating a database on your hosting  service will always involve a few steps:  1.  2.  3.  4.   Choose a name for the database. Create a user with full rights to the database. Give the user a secure password. Create or determine a host name for the MySQL host.  Most good hosting services offer detailed directions that will help you to accomplish these  steps quickly and easily.  You now have a database for Magento to use. That database resides on your hosting service,  or on your localhost. A username has been created for that database. In the next section,  you will tell Magento which username and database to use.  Time for action: Pointing your browser to the  Magento directory and stepping through the installation wizard 1.  Point your browser to Magento's install directory. For example, I installed Magento   at brew-me-a-cup.com. So I point my browser to brew-me-a-cup.com install. If   you installed in the root directory of a localhost, you would point your browser to   http:  localhost magento index.php install . This begins an installation  routine. The first step is to confirm the software license.  [ 36 ]   Chapter 2  2.   Next, select the  Locale, Time Zone, and Default Currency. Note that you are  selecting the default language and currency. Magento can work with multiple  languages and currencies, but that is beyond the scope of this beginner's guide.  First, let's get the basic store working.  [ 37 ]   Installation  3.   Next, enter the database information that you collected while creating the database  and the database user.  4.   Notice that I've select the checkbox for  Use Web Server  Apache  Rewrites. This will  create more user-friendly URLs for the web pages in my store, and might make them  rank better in search engines.  [ 38 ]   5.   Next, you will need to create an administrator account for your Magento system.  You should save all of the information from this screen in a safe place. I put mine  into an email that I sent myself, in an encrypted document on my Smart Phone,   and also stored a hard copy in a safe place.  Chapter 2  [ 39 ]   Installation  6.   You can leave the  is displayed in the following screenshot:  Encryption Key field blank. Just remember to record the key that   7.   Now, go to your site's  I did this, I saw the following error message:  frontend. This is the page that your shoppers will see. When    8.  This is one of the most common errors with a Magento installation. It is not unique   to Magento. Many PHP applications experience this error. There are several  solutions that will clear this up. In the given order, try these:                 Make sure that your hosting service uses PHP version 5. php.ini. If  In your root directory, there might be a file called  so, rename it to php5.ini. If you see files with names such as  .alias, .bash_profile, .cshrc, .screenrc, you are looking  at the root directory. If you're unsure, ask your hosting service. If that doesn't work, add the line  end of php5.ini. If that doesn't work, add the line  top of the file named .htaccess. If that doesn't work, search the knowledge base and forums at  http:  magentocommerce.com for help.  cgi.fix_pathinfo = 1 to the   Options –MultiViews to the   [ 40 ]   9.   If your site's frontend works properly, you should see something like this:  Chapter 2  10.   To visit your site's backend, go to your Magento home page and add  as done in the following screenshot:   admin,    [ 41 ]   Installation 11.   After logging in to your site's backend, you will see the   Admin Panel.  12.   Congratulations! You have a working Magento store.  What just happened? Installing Magento is very similar to installing most PHP-based applications. You first set   up your Apache-MySQL-PHP environment, or confirm that your hosting service has the   right environment. Then you download, unzip, and upload Magento. You set permissions,  and create a database and a database user. Finally, you step through the installation   wizard. The result is a fully functional Magento system that is ready to be customized into  your storefront.  Configuring a store without having some products in place is like formatting an empty word  processing document. You just can't see the effect of your choices unless you have some  products in place. However, Magento does offer some sample data that you can load directly  into its database. There are directions for that on the official Magento web site. Keep in  mind, using their products will not teach you how to add your own products. Also, you will  need to start adding your own products eventually. In the next chapter, we will start adding  some products to your store.  [ 42 ]   Chapter 2  Check  Perform the following check before proceeding to the next chapter:              Does your hosting service have all of the prerequisites listed in this chapter? Have you emailed your hosting service's technical support department and  confirmed this? Have others successfully installed Magento on the hosting service that you   are considering to use? Get onto the Magneto discussion boards and check. Do you have an FTP client for uploading your files? Also, do you have a good   text editor?  If all of your answers are "Yes," then you're ready to install.  Summary The hosting requirements for Magento can be met by many hosting services. Be choosy.   Pick one that offers all of the requirements, is reliable, and gives you the ability to set the   file permissions that you need. The Magento message board is a good place to ask other  users about their experiences with hosting services.  In this chapter, we examined the process for installing Magento. We prepared our hosting  environment, uploaded Magento, and stepped through the installer. You might want to  try this on your local computer  localhost  before trying it on a hosting service. Doing this  enables you to experiment with your store, and learn Magento without the fear of ruining  your store.  [ 43 ]    3  Categories and Attributes  The combination of products, presentation, and service makes our store unique.  In this chapter, we will see how to add products to our store. Before adding  products, we need to make some decisions about how we will organize our site.  A few minutes of planning now can save us hours of work later.  Categories, Products, and Attributes  Products are the items that are sold. In Magento, Categories organize your Products, and  Attributes describe them. Think of a Category as the place where a Product lives, and an  Attribute is anything that describes a Product. Each one of your Products can belong to one  or more Categories. Also, each Product can be described by any number of Attributes.  Is it a Category or an Attribute? Some things are clearly Categories. For example, if you have an electronics store, MP3 players  would make a good Category. If you're selling jewelry, earrings would make a good Category.  Other things are clearly Attributes. Color, description, picture, and SKU number are almost  always Attributes.  Sometimes, the same thing can be used for a Category or an Attribute. For example, suppose  your site sells shoes. If you made size an Attribute, then after your shoppers have located   a specific shoe, they can select the size they want. However, if you also made size a   Category, the shoppers could begin their shopping by selecting their size. Then they could  browse through the styles available in their size. So should size be an Attribute, a Category,  or both? The answer depends upon what kind of shopping experience you want to create for  your customers.   We are building a site that sells gourmet coffee, so we might organize our store like this:  Categories and Attributes  Examples The hierarchy of Categories, Products, and Attributes looks like this:     Category 1     Category 2                          Product 1      Product 2       Attribute 1  Attribute 2  Attribute 1  Attribute 2  Product 3      Product 4       Attribute 1  Attribute 3  Attribute 1  Attribute 3  Hawaiian Kona      Blue Mountain  Grind      Roast  Breakfast Blend      Afternoon Cruise       Grind  Caffeine     Single Origin     Blends  Grind  whole bean, drip, French press   Roast  light, medium, dark   Grind  Caffeine  regular, decaffeinated   [ 46 ]   Chapter 3  In Magento, you can give your shoppers the ability to search your store. So if the shoppers  know that they want Blue Mountain coffee, they can use the Search function to find it in  our store. However, customers who don't know exactly what they want will browse the  store. They will often begin browsing by selecting a category. With the organization that  we just saw, when customers browse our store, they will start by selecting Single Origin or  Blends. Then the shoppers will select the product they want: Hawaiian Kona, Blue Mountain,  Breakfast Blend, or Afternoon Cruise.  After our shoppers decide upon a Product, they select Attributes for that product. In our  store, shoppers can select Grind for any of the products. For Single Origin, they can also  select Roast. For blends, they can select Caffeine. This gives you a clue about how Magento  handles attributes. To each Product, you can apply as many, or as few, attributes as you want.  Now that we have definitions for Category, Product, and Attribute, let's look at each of them  in detail. Then, we can start adding products.  Categories Product Categories are important because they are the primary tool that your shoppers use  to navigate your store. Product Categories organize your store for your shoppers. Categories  can be organized into Parent Categories and Subcategories. To get to a Subcategory, you drill  down through its Parent Category.  Categories and the Navigation Menu If a Category is an Anchor Category, then it appears on the Navigation Menu. The term  "Anchor" makes the category sound as if it must be a top-level category. This is not true.   You can designate any category as an Anchor Category. Doing so puts that category into   the Navigation Menu.  When a shopper selects a normal Category from the Navigation Menu, its landing page  and any subcategories are displayed. When a shopper selects an Anchor Category from the  menu, Magento does not display the normal list of subcategories. Instead, it displays the  Attributes of all the Products in that category and its subcategories. Instead of moving down  into subcategories, the shopper uses the Attributes to filter all the Products in that Anchor  Category and the Categories below it. The Navigation Menu will not display if:           You don't create any Categories, or You create Categories, but you don't make any of them Anchors, or Your Anchor Categories are not subcategories under the Default Category.  [ 47 ]   Categories and Attributes  The Navigation Menu will display only if:           You have created at least one Category You have made at least one Category an Anchor You have made the Anchor Category a Subcategory under   Default.  When you first create your Magento site and add Products, you won't see those Products on  your site until you've met all of the previous conditions. For this reason I recommend that  you create at least one Anchor Category before you start adding Products to your store. As  you add each Product, add it to an Anchor Category. Then, the Product will display in your  store, and you can preview it. If the Anchor Category is not the one that you want for that  Product, you can change the Product's Category later.  Before we add Products to our coffee store, we will create two Anchor Categories: Single  Origin and Blends. As we add Products, we will assign them to a Category so that we can  preview them in our storefront.  Making best use of Categories There are three things that Categories can accomplish. They can:  1.   2.   3.   Help the shoppers, who know exactly what they want, to find the product that they  are looking for. Help the shoppers, who almost know what they want, to find a product that  matches their desires. Entice the shoppers, who have almost no idea of what they want, to explore   your store.  We would like to organize our store so that our Categories accomplish all these goals.  However, these goals are often mutually exclusive.  For example, suppose you create an electronics store. In addition to many other products,  your store sells MP3 players, including Apple iPods. A Category called iPods would help the  shoppers who know that they want an iPod, as they can quickly find one. However, the iPods  Category doesn't do much to help shoppers who know that they want an MP3 player, but  don't know what kind.  On the Web, you usually search something when you know what you want. But when you're  not sure about what you want, you usually browse. In an online store, you usually begin  browsing by selecting a Category. When you are creating Categories for your online store,   try to make them helpful for shoppers who almost know what they want.  [ 48 ]   Chapter 3  However, what if a high percentage of your shoppers are looking for a narrow category of  products? Consider creating a top-level Category to make those products easily accessible.  Again, suppose you have an electronics store that sells a wide variety of items. If a high  percentage of your customers want iPods, it might be worthwhile to create a Category just  for those few products. The logs from the Search function on your site are one way you can  determine whether your shoppers are interested in a narrow Category of a Product. Are 30  percent of the searches on your site for lefthanded fishing reels? If so, you might want to  create a top-level Category just for those Products.  Attributes An Attribute is a characteristic of a Product. Name, price, SKU, size, color, and manufacturer  are all examples of Attributes.  System versus Simple Attributes Notice that the first few examples  name, price, and SKU  are all required for a Product to  function in Magento. Magento adds these Attributes to every product, and requires you to  assign a value for each of them. These are called System Attributes.  The other three examples  size, color, and manufacturer  are optional Attributes. They are  created by the store owner. They are called Simple Attributes. When we discuss creating   and assigning Attributes, we are almost always discussing Simple Attributes.  Attribute Sets Notice that the Single Origin coffees have two Attributes: Grind and Roast. Also notice that  the blends have the Attributes of Grind and Caffeine.  Grind  whole bean, drip, French press   Roast  light, medium, dark       Single Origin     Blends              Hawaiian Kona       Blue Mountain  Grind      Roast  Breakfast Blend      Afternoon Cruise       Grind  Caffeine  Grind  Caffeine  regular, decaffeinated   [ 49 ]   Categories and Attributes  In this example, the store owner created three Attributes: Grind, Roast, and Caffeine. Next,  the store owner grouped the Attributes into two Attribute Sets: one set contains Grind and  Roast, and the other set contains Grind and Caffeine. Then, an Attribute set was applied to  each Product.  Attributes are not applied directly to Products. They are first grouped into Attribute Sets,  and then a set can be applied to a Product. This means that you will need to create a set  for each different combination of Attributes in your store. You can name these Sets after  the Attributes they contain, such as Grind-Roast. Or, you can name them after the type of  Product which will use those Attributes, such as Single Origin Attributes.  If each Product in a group will use the same Attribute as every other Product in that group,  then you can name the set after that group. For example, at this time, all Single Origin  coffees have the same Attributes: Grind and Roast. If they will all have these two Attributes  and you will always add and remove Attributes to them as a group, then you could name   the set Single Origin Attributes.  If the Products in a group will likely use different Attributes, then name the set after the  Attributes. For example, if you expect that some Single Origin coffees will use the Attributes  Grind and Roast, while others will use just Roast, then it would not make sense to create  a set called Single Origin Attributes. Instead, create a set called Grind-Roast, and another  called Roast.  Three types of Products In Magento, you can create three different types of Products: Simple, Configurable,   and Grouped. The following is a very brief definition for each type of Product.  Simple Product A Simple Product is a single Product, with Attributes that the store owner chooses. As the  saying goes, "What you see is what you get." The customer does not get to choose anything  about the Product.  In our coffee store, a good example for a Simple Product might be a drip coffee maker.   It comes in only one color. And while the customer can buy drip coffee makers of various  sizes  4 cups, 8 cups, 12 cups, and so on , each of those is a separate Product.  A bad example of a Simple Product would be a type of coffee. For example, we might want to  allow the customer to choose the type of roast for our Hawaiian Kona coffee: light, medium,  or dark. Because we want the customer to choose a value for an Attribute, that would not be  a good Simple Product.  [ 50 ]   Chapter 3  Configurable Product A Configurable Product is a single Product, with at least one Attribute that the customer  gets to choose. There is a saying that goes, "Have it your way." The customer gets to choose  something about the Product.  A good example of a Configurable Product would be a type of coffee that comes in several  different roasts: light, medium, and dark. Because we want the customer to choose the roast   s he wants, that would be a good Configurable Product.  Grouped Product A Grouped Product is several Simple Products that are displayed on the same page. You can  force the customer to buy the group, or allow the customer to buy each Product separately.  The previous definitions are adequate for now. However, when you start creating  Products, you will need to know more about each type of Product. When we  discuss Products later in this book, you will learn more about each of these.  Putting it together  In the previous sections, we covered the definitions of Product, Category, and Attribute. A  Product appears when it is assigned to an active Category, and that Category is an Anchor, or  is under an Anchor Category. Attributes are added to sets, and a set can then be applied to   a Product.  I recommend that before you add Products to your store, you create the Anchor Categories  into which you will place those Products. This enables you to preview how those Products  will appear in your store. I also recommend that you create the Attribute Sets you will need  for those Products.  Let's put these concepts into action. In our new store, we will:  1.  2.  3.   Create some Anchor Categories. Create some Attribute Sets. Add a few Products.  [ 51 ]   Categories and Attributes  Time for action: Creating Categories In this section, we will create a Category for our store. We will make it an Anchor Category   so that customers can search for the Products in this category based on their Attributes.  Before you begin As Categories are the main tools for organizing your store, it is important to make best use of  them. Plan which Categories you want to use. What will make products easiest to find? What  will entice potential customers to explore? Also, remember that space in the Navigation  Menu is limited. So, choose your Anchor Categories carefully.  The result of the following steps is an Anchor Category. By making slightly different choices,  you can also create non-Anchor Categories and Subcategories.  1.   Log in to your site's backend, which we call the Administrative Panel:  2.   Select   Catalog  Manage Categories:  [ 52 ]   Notice that there is already one Category, called Default:  Chapter 3  You are going to add your new Category under Default. Doing this will create   a Subcategory. This step is essential, because only those Anchor Categories that   are children of the Default Category will appear in your Navigation Menu.  You can add Categories so that they are not under the Default Category. They  will be at the same level as Default. However, only Categories under Default  will automatically appear in the Navigation Menu. If a Category is not under  Default, you will need to create some other way for your customers to get to  that Category.  For example, look at these Categories. Notice that Single Origin Coffees is under  Default, while I don't appear in the Nav Menu is not:  The result will be a Navigation Menu with only Single Origin Coffees displayed:  [ 53 ]   Categories and Attributes  3.  4.   Select the  Click on   Default Category.  Add Subcategory. A blank, New Category window is displayed:  5.   Enter a  we will enter Single Origin Coffees:  Name for the Category. This will display in your storefront. In our example,   6.   Is Active, selecting Yes makes the Category visible to customers.   For the setting  Selecting No will hide this Category and its Subcategories in your store. Because we want this Category to appear in the Navigation Menu, we will select Yes.  [ 54 ]   Chapter 3  7.   8.  9.   The  URL Key enables you to enter a search-engine-friendly path for this Category.  In this example, I entered single-origin-coffees so that when a shopper selects this  Category, the address in their browser reads http:  brew-me-a-cup.com. If you leave this field blank, Magento will put the name of the Category into this  field. You cannot enter spaces into this field. The  The  Here is what the page looks like so far:  Description that you enter here will appear on the Category's landing page.  Image that you upload will also appear on the Category's landing page.    [ 55 ]   Categories and Attributes  The default Magento template will re-size the Category's image so that it is   475-pixels wide. If you upload an image that is taller than it is wider, the image   will take up a lot of space on the landing page. For example, I've uploaded an image  that is 240-pixels wide and 266-pixels high. Magento resized the image so that it is  475-pixels wide and 526-pixels high. Notice how much space this image takes up:  [ 56 ]   Also notice that the background of the image is solid. It does not allow the gradient  on the page to show through. I want an image that will not take up so much vertical  space. And, I want the gradient to show through. I solved both problems with this  image, which is 475-pixels wide, 266-pixels high, and has a transparent background:  Chapter 3  Because the image is already 475-pixels wide, Magento did not re-size it. The result  is less space taken up by the image, and more space left for my products.  A full discussion of working with graphic images is beyond the scope of this  book. However, here is a hint for creating graphics for your Category landing  pages. Design the subject of the graphic according to the size you want. In this  example, it was the African continent. Then, make the canvas of the graphic   475-pixels wide. Finally, make the background transparent. The result will be   an image that is the right size for your landing page.  [ 57 ]   Categories and Attributes  10.   Page Title appears in the browser's title bar. This is not the same as the Name.   The  The Name appears in the Navigation Menu at the top of the page, not in the  browser's title bar:  The Category's Name and Page Title are both opportunities for you to help the  page's search engine rank. You can make them identical, which will help the page  score better when people search for that term. Or, you can make them different  so that both search terms will be covered by this one page.  11.  The Meta Keywords and Meta Description appear in meta tags, in the page's HTML   code. Enter information about this page, which you think will help search engines   to properly categorize this page. A meta tag contains information not normally displayed to the user. It contains   information about the page. The word "meta" means "about this subject".   Webmasters use meta tags to tell search engines about a page and help the   search engines better categorize that page. You can see the meta tags in a page if you view the pages' source code. The   following code shows the first few lines of source code for the Single Origin   Coffees page. Notice the last two meta tags: <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN"   "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd"> <html xmlns="http:  www.w3.org 1999 xhtml" xml:lang="en"  lang="en">         Single Origin Coffee from Brew-Me-A-Cup -   Default Store View   <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text html;         charset=utf-8" >                     [ 58 ]   Chapter 3            12.   13.   14.   15.  16.   Display Mode, select Products only. This will cause the Category's landing page   Use Meta Keywords and Meta Description as opportunities to optimize the page for  search engines. For  to display a list of products from that Category. You can also select Static block only or Static block and products. We are   not selecting these now because we are not covering Static Blocks in this   beginner's guide. If we chose to show a Static Block, we would use the  which Block to display. For now, we can ignore this setting. We want shoppers to be able to filter products under this Category. So for  we will choose Yes. Click on the  This completes the General Information tab for the Category. There are two other  tabs: Category Products and Custom Design. We will learn about these tabs later.   We have done everything to get this Category to work in our store.  CMS Block setting to specify   Save Category button.  Is Anchor,   What just happened? You now have at least one Anchor Category under the Default category. This new Anchor  Category has its own landing page, which you customized with text and a graphic. The  Products under this Anchor Category will be listed on its landing page.  Have a go hero Now that we have an Anchor Category, we can press ahead and complete the other steps  needed to create our catalog. Or, we can create more Categories. For our coffee store, create  several more Categories so that our store is organized like this:     Single Origin   Coffees           Latin American African Hawaiian     Blended Coffees  [ 59 ]   Categories and Attributes  Single Origin and Blended will be Anchors. The result will look as follows:  Once we have the Categories, we need to hold our Products, it's time to add Attribute Sets.  Time for action: Creating Attributes In this section we will create an Attribute set for our store. First, we will create Attributes.  Then, we will create the set.  Before you begin Because Attributes are the main tool for describing your Products, it is important to make  the best use of them. Plan which Attributes you want to use. What aspects or characteristics  of your Products will a customer want to search for? Make those Attributes. What aspects of  your Products will a customer want to choose? Make these Attributes, too.  Attributes are organized into Attribute Sets. Each set is a collection of Attributes. You should  create different sets to describe the different types of Products that you want to sell. In our  coffee store, we will create two Attribute Sets: one for Single Origin coffees and one for  Blends. They will differ in only one way. For Single Origin coffees, we will have an Attribute  showing the country or region where the coffee is grown. We will not have this Attribute for  blends because the coffees used in a blend can come from all over the world. Our sets will  look like the following:  [ 60 ]   Single Origin Attribute set  Blended Attribute set  Chapter 3  Name  Description  Image  Grind  Roast  Origin  SKU  Price  Size  Name  Description  Image  Grind  Roast  SKU  Price  Size  Now, let's create the Attributes and put them into sets.  The result of the following directions will be several new Attributes and two new Attribute Sets:  1.   If you haven't already, log in to your site's backend, which we call the   Administrative Panel:  [ 61 ]   Categories and Attributes  2.  Select Catalog  Attributes  Manage Attributes.  A list of all the Attributes is displayed. These attributes have been created for you.  Some of these Attributes  such as color, cost, and description  are visible to your  customers. Other Attributes affect the display of a Product, but your customers will  never see them. For example, custom_design can be used to specify the name of a  custom layout, which will be applied to a Product's page. Your customers will never  see the name of the custom layout.  We will add our own attributes to this list.  [ 62 ]   3.  Click the Add New Attribute button. The New Product Attribute page displays:  Chapter 3  There are two tabs on this page: Properties and Manage Label   Options. You are in  the Properties tab. The Attribute Properties section contains settings that only the Magento   administrator  you  will see. These settings are values that you will use when   working with the Attribute. The Frontend Properties section contains settings   that affect how this Attribute will be presented to your shoppers. We will cover   each setting on this page.  4.   Attribute Code is the name of the Attribute. Your customers will never see this   value. You will use it when managing the Attribute.  Refer back to the list of Attributes that appeared in Step 2. The Attribute identifier  appears in the first column, labeled Attribute Code. The Attribute Code must contain  only lowercase letters, numbers, and the underscore character. And, it must begin with  a letter. The Scope of this Attribute can be set as Store View, Website, or Global. For  now, you can leave it set to the default—Store View. The other values become useful  when you use one Magento installation to create multiple stores or multiple web sites.  That is beyond the scope of this quick-start guide.  [ 63 ]   Categories and Attributes  5.  After you assign an Attribute set to a Product, you will fill in values for the Attributes.  For example, suppose you assign a set that contains the attributes color, description,  price, and image. You will then need to enter the color, description, price, and image  for that Product.  Notice that each of the Attributes in that set is a different kind of data. For color,  you would probably want to use a drop-down list to make selecting the right color  quick and easy. This would also avoid using different terms for the same color such  as "Red" and "Magenta." For description, you would probably want to use a free- form text field. For price, you would probably want to use a field that accepts only  numbers, and that requires you to use two decimal places. And for image, you would  want a field that enables you to upload a picture. The field Catalog Input Type for Store Owner enables you to select the kind of data  that this Attribute will hold:  In our example we are creating an Attribute called roast. When we assign this value  to a Product, we want to select a single value for this field from a list of choices. So,  we will select Dropdown. If you select Dropdown or Multiple Select for this field, then under the Manage  Label Options tab, you will need to enter the list of choices  the list of values  for  this field. If you select Yes for Unique Value, then no two products can have the same value  for this Attribute. For example, if I made roast a unique Attribute, that means only  one kind of coffee in my store could be a Light roast, only one kind of coffee could  be a French roast, only one could be Espresso, and so on. For an Attribute such as  roast, this wouldn't make much sense. However, if this Attribute was the SKU of the  Product, then I might want to make it unique. That would prevent me from entering  the same SKU number for two different Products. If you select Yes for Values Required, then you must select or enter a value for this  Attribute. You will not be able to save a Product with this Attribute if you leave it  blank. In the case of roast, it makes sense to require a value. Our customers would  not buy a coffee without knowing what kind of roast the coffee has.  6.   7.   [ 64 ]   8.   Input Validation for Store Owner causes Magento to check the value entered for an  Attribute, and confirm that it is the right kind of data. When entering a value for this  Attribute, if you do not enter the kind of data selected, then Magento gives you a  warning message.  Chapter 3  9.  The Apply To field determines which Product Types can have this Attribute applied  to them. Remember that the three Product Types in Magento are Simple, Grouped,  and Configurable. Recall that in our coffee store, if a type of coffee comes in only  one roast, then it would be a Simple Product. And, if the customer gets to choose  the roast, it would be a Configurable Product. So we want to select at least Simple  Product and Configurable Product for the Apply To field:  But what about Grouped Product? We might sell several different types of coffee   in one package, which would make it a Grouped Product. For example, we might   sell a Grouped Product that consists of a pound of Hawaiian Kona and a pound of  Jamaican Blue Mountain. We could call this group something like "Island Coffees."  If we applied the Attribute roast to this Grouped Product, then both types of coffee  would be required to have the same roast.  However, if Kona is better with a lighter roast and Blue Mountain is better with   a darker roast, then we don't want them to have the same roast. So in our coffee  store, we will not apply the Attribute roast to Grouped Products. When we sell   coffees in special groupings, we will select the roast for each coffee. You will need to decide which Product Types each Attribute can be applied to. If you  are the store owner and the only one using your site, you will know which Attributes  should be applied to which Products. So, you can safely choose All Product Types for  this setting.  [ 65 ]   Categories and Attributes  in your store.  10.  By default, Magento puts a quick search box in the top right corner of each page    The quick search box will search only those Attributes for which Use in quick search  is set to Yes. For some examples, let's refer back to our list of Attributes:  Look in the column labeled Searchable. Notice that color and description are  searchable. This means that if a customer enters a word into the quick search   box that is found in the color or description of a Product, then that Product will   be found. Notice that customers cannot search based on a Product's price. In our coffee store, we will make roast a searchable Attribute because we know that  some customers prefer only coffees that are roasted a specific way. If you select Yes for Use in advanced search, this attribute will have its own field on  the Advanced Search page:  In our coffee store, we will make roast a field on the Advanced Search page. By default, Magento puts an Advanced Search link at the bottom of each page   in your store.  [ 66 ]   Clicking on this link takes you to the Catalog Advanced Search page. Some Attributes  get their own field on this search page:  Chapter 3  11.  By default, Magento enables customers to compare Products in your store. When   viewing a Product, the customer sees an Add to Compare link, as shown in the  following screenshot:  [ 67 ]   Categories and Attributes  When a customer clicks on this link, the Product is added to the Compare   Products block.  Next, when the customer clicks on the Compare Items button, the Compare   Products page pops up:  [ 68 ]   Chapter 3  On the Compare Products page, notice that only certain Attributes are compared. In  the previous example, Model, SKU, Short Description, Description, Color, and Price  appear on the Compare Products page. If you select Yes for Comparable on Front-end, this attribute will appear on the  Compare Products page. You don't want to crowd the Compare Products page with Attributes, but you   want to include all the Attributes that will help your customer to choose between  similar Products. This requires you to think like a customer. When your customer   is comparing similar Products, which Attributes will help the customer to see a real  difference between them? For example, in our coffee store, customers who are interested in one lightly roasted  coffee are probably interested in other light roasts. Any coffees that our customers  compare probably have the same roast. Therefore, roast would not be an Attribute  that helps our customers to decide between similar Products. So in our coffee store,  we will not make roast a field on the Compare Products page. However, if we later  add an Attribute called character, that would probably be a good one for the   Compare Products page.  12.  The Use in Layered Navigation setting enables your customers to filter Products   based on this Attribute. When this is enabled, your customer sees a filter on the left  side of the page, where  s he can select values for this Attribute. Magento will then  display only Products that have a value for the Attribute that falls within the range  selected by the customer.  [ 69 ]   Categories and Attributes  In the following screenshot, notice that the customer has selected the Category  Electronics from the Navigation Menu at the top of the page. Also, notice that the  customer can filter the results by three Attributes on the lefthand side of the page.  They are Price, Color, and Manufacturer as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 70 ]   Chapter 3  The customer can now find the Products that  s he wants, using two criteria.   A Category can be selected from the Navigation Menu at the top of the page.   And, an Attribute Filter can be selected from the Layered Navigation menu on   the left side of the page. Notice the values for the Attribute Price. The first range covers $100 to $200. Then,  the values jump to $300. The Price range $200 to $300 is missing. This is because no  Products in this Category fall in that price range. There are three settings for Use in Layered Navigation. Selecting No excludes this  Attribute from the Layered Navigation menu.  Selecting Filterable  with results  will put the Attribute into the Layered Navigation  menu, but only for those values that show some Products. That is, it places only  those values that produce results when used as a filter. That is what happened in   the previous screenshot. Selecting Filterable  no results  will put the Attribute into the Layered Navigation  menu, and all values will be displayed. Even values that don't produce results will   be displayed. If that setting were selected in the page we just saw, the Price range  $200-$300 would be displayed, even though there are no Products in that range. You can make an attribute filterable only if the Input Type is Dropdown, Multiple  Select, or Price.  13.  If you use this Attribute in the Layered Navigation menu  that is, if you allow    your customers to filter by this Attribute , then Position determines the position   of the attribute in the Layered Navigation. Entering 1 puts this Attribute at the   top of the menu.  14. The setting for Visible on Catalog Pages on Front-end applies only to Simple   Attributes. That is, it applies only to Attributes that you create, not to those that   are automatically created by Magento.  [ 71 ]   Categories and Attributes  Every product page has a section called Additional Information. It displays below the  Product Description section. In the following screenshot, you can see this section:  [ 72 ]   Chapter 3  If you select Yes for Visible on Catalog Pages on Front-end, this Attribute will appear  in the Additional Information section of each Product that uses the Attribute. In  the previous example, the Attributes Model, In Depth, Dimensions, and Activation  Information had Visible on Catalog Pages on Front-end set to Yes. If a Product has no Attributes that are Visible on Catalog Pages on Front-end, then  the Additional Information section will not display for that Product.  15.  Select the Manage Labels Options tab:  16.  Under Manage Titles in the Admin field, enter the name that you will use for this  Attribute in the administrative interface. In the Default Store View field enter the  name for this Attribute that your customers will see in your store:  17.  If this Attribute type is Dropdown or Multiple Select, then the Manage Options   section will appear:  Recall that when an Attribute is a dropdown or multiple selection, you must select  one or more values for that Attribute from a list. The Manage Options section is  where you create that list. In the Admin field, enter the name that you will use for this value in the   administrative interface. You will see this name when you are creating a Product,  and assigning a value to the Attribute. In the Default Store View field, enter the  value that your customers will see in your store.  [ 73 ]   Categories and Attributes  If this Attribute type is not Dropdown or Multiple Select, then this section will   not appear.  18.  Click on Save Attribute. The Attribute is saved and you are returned to the list of  Attributes. You should see the one you just added in the list, along with a success  message at the top of the page like this:  This concludes the process for creating a new Attribute. Repeat this as needed. In  our demonstration store, we will create two more Attributes: grind and caffeine.  What just happened? In this section you created new Attributes. These Attributes will be used to describe your  Products. Your customers will be able to use some of these Attributes to filter Products, helping  them to drill down to exactly the merchandise they want. Other Attributes will appear in the  Search function, enabling your customers to search your entire site for Products that meet  their criteria. Your customers will also be able to use some of these Attributes when they  compare products side-by-side, helping them to choose between the Products.   What's next? Next, we will put our Attributes into Attribute Sets. Recall that you do not apply Attributes  individually to Products. Instead, you apply a set of Attributes to each Product.  Time for action: Creating Attribute Sets  1.  If you haven't already, log in to your site's backend. We call it the Administrative Panel. 2.   Select  The Manage Attribute Sets page is displayed. If this is a new installation, there will  be only one Attribute set listed—Default as shown in the following screenshot:  Catalog  Attributes  Manage Attribute Sets.  [ 74 ]   Chapter 3  3.   Click on   Add New Attribute Set. The Edit Set Name page is displayed as follows:  4.   5.   Enter a  Name for this set. The shoppers will never see the name of this Attribute  set. You will see the name when you create a Product and need to assign a set to  that Product. This is why you should use a name that will help you remember the  purpose of this set. If you will use the set only for a specific kind of merchandise, consider naming the  set after that merchandise. In the previous screenshot, I am creating a set that I will  apply only to coffee sold by the pound. The name coffee-by-pound reminds me of  the purpose for this set. If you will apply this set to several kinds of merchandise, consider using a name   that describes the contents of the set. In our demo site, we could create a set that  contains those Attributes called grind-roast-origin. For  set that you created, then your only choice will be Default. When you create a new set, you must always base it upon an existing set. The first  time, this will be Default because that is the only set available. Default contains all of the system Attributes that are required for each Product,   plus a few more Attributes that come with the standard Magento installation.   Based On, select a set that will be the starting point for this set. If this is the first   [ 75 ]   Categories and Attributes  You can edit the contents of Default, but you should not do this without a  compelling reason. Leaving Default intact ensures that you will always have a set  that contains the minimum Attributes needed for a Product. When you need to  create a set that is very different from any of the others in your store, it is usually  easiest to start with a minimum set such as Default and build it up. This is easier  than starting with another set, removing the Attributes that you have added, and  then building it up. Starting with Default and building up is easier when making  new sets that are unlike any others in your store.  6.   Click on   Save Attribute Set. The Edit Attribute Set window is displayed:  The left column contains the name of this set. The middle column contains all of the  Attributes that are a part of this set. Right now, those are the same as for the Default  set. The right column contains Attributes that are not part of this set. The label   Unassigned Attributes might be misleading because these Attributes might have  been assigned to other sets.  Notice that the Attributes in this set are organized into Groups. Each Group in this  set will create a tab on the Product page if at least one Attribute in that Group is  set to display. If all of the Attributes in a Group are hidden from the shopper, then  that Group will not create a tab on the Product page. For example, the group Meta  Information contains only Attributes that are hidden, so shoppers will not see a tab  called Meta Information.  [ 76 ]   The orange circles mark the System Attributes. Recall that every set must contain   all of the System Attributes because each Product must have all of the System   Attributes applied to it. To add an Attribute to the set, open a Group and then drag the Attribute into that  Group as shown in the following screenshot:  7.   Chapter 3  In our demo store, we will add caffeine, grind, and roast to the General group.  8.  To remove an Attribute from the set, drag it from the Group that contains it to the   Unassigned Attributes column. In our demo store, we will remove manufacturer and color because they do not   apply to our coffee product. To move an Attribute from one Group to another Group, just drag and drop   the Attribute.  9.   10. To add a new Group  and possibly create a new tab on the Product page , click on   Add New. When prompted, enter the name of the new Group.  11. To change the order of the Groups, drag and drop them.  [ 77 ]   Categories and Attributes  The tabs that these Groups create on the Product page display left to right. They   appear in the order that the Groups are placed here. The topmost Group creates   the tab on the left, and the bottom Group creates the rightmost tab.  12. To delete a group, select it and click on Delete Selected Group.  You cannot delete a Group that has System Attributes in it. When you delete a  Group, its Attributes become unassigned. When you are finished, click on Save   Attribute Set.  What just happened? You have just created at least one Attribute set. Each set contains a collection of Attributes  that you will use to describe a product. If you created just one set, every Product in your   site will use that set. This is fine if all your Products are similar  for example, if all you sell   is coffee . If you created several sets, you probably sell several different kinds of Products    for example, coffee and coffee brewing accessories .  Pop quiz  1.

Summary  In this chapter, we created Categories that will hold our Products. Think of a Category   as a department in a physical store. Then, we created Attributes and Attribute Sets. Think   of Attributes as the qualities that enable us to distinguish one product from another.  In the next chapter, we will finish our basic set up by adding a Tax Class for our Products.  Then, we will be ready to start adding Products.   [ 78 ]   4Taxes  In the real world, the tax rate that you pay is based on three things: location,  product type, and purchaser type. In Magento, we can create Tax Rules that  determine the amount of tax that a customer pays, based upon the shipping  address, product class, and customer class.  When you buy a product, you sometimes pay sales tax on that product. The sales tax that  you pay is based on:              type of product that you purchased. For example, many places don't tax    you purchased the product from. Tax rules vary in different cities, states,    Where and countries. The  clothing purchases. And, some places tax only some kinds of clothing. This means  that you must be able to apply different tax rates to different kinds of products. The  type of purchaser you are. For example, if you buy a laser printer for your  home, it is likely that you will pay sales tax. This is because you are a retail customer.  If you buy the same printer for your business, in most places you will not pay sales  tax. This is because you are a business customer. The  above a specific amount.  amount of the purchase. For example, some places tax clothing purchases only   Anatomy of a Tax Rule  A Tax Rule is a combination of the tax rate, shipping address, product class, customer class,  and amount of purchase.   Taxes  A Tax Rule states that you pay this amount of tax if you are this class of purchaser,  and you bought this class of product for this amount, and are shipping it to   this place.  The components of a Tax Rule are shown in the following screenshot. This screen is found  under Sales  Tax  Manage Tax Rules  Add New Tax Rule.  You will see the Name of the Tax Rule while working in the backend.  Customer Tax Class Customer Tax Class is a type of customer that is making a purchase. Before creating a Tax  Rule, you will need to have at least one Customer Tax Class. Magento provides you with a Tax  Rule called Retail Customer. If you serve different types of customers—retail, business, and  nonprofit—you will need to create different Customer Tax Classes.  Product Tax Class Product Tax Class is a type of Product that is being purchased. When you create a Product,  you will assign a Product Tax Class to that Product. Magento comes with two Product Tax  Classes:Taxable Goods and Shipping. The class Shipping is applied to shipping charges because  some places charge sales tax on shipping. If your customer's sales tax is different for different  types of Products, then you will need to create a Product Tax Class for each type of Product.  [ 80 ]   Chapter 4  Tax Rate Tax Rate is a combination of place, or tax zone, and percentage. A zone can be a country,  state, or zip code.  Each zone that you specify can have up to five sales tax percentages. For example, in the  default installation of Magento, there is one tax rate for the zone New York. This is 8.3750  percent, and applies to retail customers. The following window can be found at Sales  Tax   Manage Tax Zones & Rates and then clicking on US-NY-*-Rate 1:  So in the screenshot of our Tax Rule, the Tax Rate US-NY-*-Rate 1 doesn't mean "a sales tax  of 1 percent." It means "Tax rate number 1 for New York, which is 8.3750 percent."  In this scenario, New York charges 8.3750 percent sales tax on retail sales. If New York does  not charge sales tax for wholesale customers, and you sell to wholesale customers, then you  will need to create another Tax Rate for New York:  [ 81 ]   Taxes  Whenever a zone has different sales taxes for different types of products or customers,   you will need to create different Tax Rates for that zone.  Priority If several Tax Rules try to apply several Tax Rates at the same time, how should Magento  handle them? Should it add them all together? Or, should it apply one rate, calculate the  total, and then apply the second rate to that total? That is, should Magento add them or  compound them?  For example, suppose you sell a product in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Further suppose that  according to the Tax Rule for Pennsylvania, the sales tax for that item is 6 percent, and that  the Tax Rule for Philadelphia adds another 1 percent. In this case, you want Magento to add  the two sales taxes. So, you would give the two Tax Rates the same Priority.  By contrast, Tax Rates that belong to Tax Rules with different Priorities are compounded. The  Tax Rate with the higher Priority  the lower number  is applied, and the next higher Priority  is applied to that total, and so on.  Sort Order Sort Order determines the Tax Rules' position in the list of Tax Rules.  Why create Tax Rules now?  Why create a Tax Rule now, before adding our first Product? When you add a Product to   your store, you put that Product into a Category, assign an Attribute Set, and select a Tax  Class for that Product. By default, Magento comes with two Product Tax Classes and one Tax  Rule already created. The Product Tax Classes are Taxable Goods and Shipping. The Tax Rule  is Retail Customer-Taxable Goods-Rate 1. If you sell anything other than taxable goods, or  sell to anyone other than retail customers, you will need to create a new Tax Rule to cover  that situation.   Creating a Tax Rule  The process for creating a Tax Rule is:  1.  2.  3.   Create the Customer Tax Classes that you need, or confirm that you have them. Create the Product Tax Classes that you need, or confirm that you have them. Create the Tax Rates that you need, or confirm that you have them and that they  apply to the zones that you need.  [ 82 ]   Chapter 4  4.   Create and name the Tax Rule:           Assign Customer Tax Class, Product Tax Class, and Tax Rates to   the Rule. Use the Priority to determine whether the Rule is added,   or compounded, with other Rules. Determine the Sort Order of the Rule and save it.  Each of these steps is covered in the subsections that follow.  Time for action: Creating a Customer Tax Class  1.  From the Admin Panel, select Sales  Tax  Customer Tax Classes.  The Customer Tax Classes page is displayed. If this is a new installation, only one  Class is listed, Retail Customer as shown in the following screenshot:  2.   3.  4.   5.   Click on   Add New.

A Tax Rule is composed of a Customer Class, Product Class, Tax Rate, and the location of the  purchaser. You have just created the second part of that formula: the Product Class.  Creating Tax Rates In Magento, you can create Tax Rates one at a time. You can also import Tax Rates in bulk.  Each method is covered in the next section.  Time for action: Creating a Tax Rate in Magento  1.  From the Admin Panel, select Sales  Tax  Manage Tax Zones & Rates.  The Manage Tax Rates page is displayed. If this is a new installation, only two Tax  Rates are listed: US-CA-*-Rate 1 and US-NY-*-Rate 1.  [ 84 ]   2.   Click on   Add New Tax Rate. The Add New Tax Rate page gets displayed:  Chapter 4  3.   4.    is the name that you give this Tax Rate. You will see this name when   Tax Identifier you select this Tax Rate. The example that we saw is named US-CA-*-Rate 1. Notice how this name tells you  the Country, State, and Zip Post code for the Tax Rate.  The asterisk indicates that it  applies to all zip codes in California.  It also tells which rate applies. Notice that the  name doesn't give the actual percentage, which is 8.25%. Instead, it says Rate 1. This  is because the percentage can change when California changes its tax rate. If you  include the actual rate in the name, you would need to rename this Tax Rate when  California changes the rate. Another way this rate could have been named is US-CA- All-Retail. Before creating new Tax Rates, you should develop a naming scheme that  works for you and your business. Country applies. Magento calculates sales tax based upon the billing address, and not the  shipping address. Country and State are drop-down lists. You must select from the  options given to you. Zip Post Code accepts both numbers and letters. You can  enter an asterisk in this field and it will be a wild card. That is, the rate will apply   to all zip post codes in the selected country and state.  You can enter a zip post code without entering a country or state. If you do this,   you should be sure that zip post code is unique in the entire world.  , State, and Zip Post Code determine the zone to which this Tax Rate   [ 85 ]   Taxes  Suppose you have one tax rate for all zip codes in a country state, such as 6% for  United States Pennsylvania. Also, suppose that you want to have a different tax rate  for a few zip codes in that state. In this case, you would create separate tax rates for  those few zip codes. The rates for the specific zip codes would override the rates for  the wild card. So in a Tax Rate, a wild card means, "All zones unless this is overridden  by a specific zone." In our demo store, we are going to create a Tax Rate for retail  customers who live in the state of Pennsylvania, but not in the city of Philadelphia   as shown:  5.   Save Rate. You are taken back to the Manage Tax Rates page. The Tax Rate   Click on  that you just added should be listed on the page. This procedure is useful for adding Tax Rates one at a time. However, if you need   to add many Tax Rates at once, you will probably want to use the Import Tax Rates  feature. This enables you to import a .csv, or a text-only file. You usually create  the file in a spreadsheet such as OpenOffice Calc or Excel. The next section covers  importing Tax Rates.  What just happened? A Tax Rule is composed of a Customer Class, Product Class, Tax Rate, and the location of  the purchaser. You have just created the third part of that formula: the Tax Rate. The Tax  Rate included the location and the percentage of tax. You created the Tax Rate by manually  entering the information into the system, which is suitable if you don't have too many Tax  Rates to type.  [ 86 ]   Chapter 4  Time for action: Exporting and importing Tax Rates In my demo store, I have created a Tax Rate for the state of Pennsylvania. The Tax Rate  for the city of Philadelphia is different. However, Magento doesn't enable me to choose a  separate Tax Rate based on the city. So I must create a Tax Rate for each zip code in the city  of Philadelphia. At this time there are 84 zip codes, and are shown here:  19019 19108 19120 19131 19142 19153 19177 19192  19092 19109 19121 19132 19143 19154 19178 19193  19093 19110 19122 19133 19144 19155 19179 19194  19099 19111 19123 19134 19145 19160 19181 19196  19101 19112 19124 19135 19146 19161 19182 19197  19102 19113 19125 19136 19147 19162 19183 19244  19103 19114 19126 19137 19148 19170 19184 19255  19104 19115 19127 19138 19149 19171 19185  19105 19116 19128 19139 19150 19172 19187  19106 19118 19129 19140 19151 19173 19188  19107 19119 19130 19141 19152 19175 19191  I don't want to manually create each of these Tax Rates in Magento. It would be much faster  if I create them in a spreadsheet program, and import the file into Magento. The process will  be like this:  1.  2.  3.  4.   Export the existing Tax Rates from Magento to a  Add the new Tax Rates and or edit the existing ones. Check the file in a text editor and convert to UNIX format.

Choose the option that  enables you to open the file in your spreadsheet application.  4.   Now that the file is open in your spreadsheet, you can see the column headings in  the first row and the Tax Rates in the rows below that:  Adding the new Tax Rates and or editing the existing ones  1.  Edit the spreadsheet as needed. In our demo store, we collect sales tax only in   Pennsylvania. So, we will delete the rows for CA and NY.  [ 88 ]   2.   Adding the 84 zip codes for Philadelphia is as simple as pasting them into the  spreadsheet. The result is 84 new rows:  Chapter 4  3.   Now fill in the  Country and State Region columns. In most spreadsheets, you can  enter the values into the first row, select the first cell and the ones below that, and  fill the lower cells with the contents of the top cell:  [ 89 ]   Taxes  4.  You probably want the name of the Tax Rate to use the same format as the others,   Country-State-ZipCode-TypeOfRate. For example, the first rate for Philadelphia  would be called US-PA-Philly-19019-Retail. However, I do not want to type all of the  84 names. So, I will use the CONCATENATE function in my spreadsheet to join the  different parts of the name into one text string as shown in the following screenshot:  5.  Notice that the first part of the name consists of the text US-PA-Philly-. Then,   this function looks at the cell in column D, which is the zip code. Finally, it adds   the text–Retail to the end of the text string. The result is the name of the Tax Rate.  Finally, use Fill  Down to copy this formula into the other 83 rows. Save the spreadsheet as a   .csv, or text-only, file. Make a note of where you save it.  6.   Checking the file in a text editor and converting it to a UNIX format When using a text file, Magento may display an error reading Invalid file format upload  attempt, your text file is probably saved in a Windows or Macintosh, text-only format.   Even though text-only files look the same on Windows, Mac, and UNIX  Linux , they are   not. Before Magento can read the file, you need to convert the file to the UNIX format.  [ 90 ]   Chapter 4  We need to use a text editor designed to work with Windows Mac UNIX formats. On  Windows, try the free program TedNPad. On Mac, try TextWrangler. Now, let's convert   it to a UNIX format:  1.   Open the file using a text-editing program. Make sure your spreadsheet saved the  file in the correct format. Here are the first few lines of my .csv file: "Code","Country","State","Zip Post Code","Rate","default" "US-PA-NotPhilly-Retail","US","PA","*","6.0000","" "US-PA-Philly-19019-Retail","US","PA","19019","7.0000","" "US-PA-Philly-19092-Retail","US","PA","19092","7.0000","" "US-PA-Philly-19093-Retail","US","PA","19093","7.0000",""  Notice that each item of data is enclosed in double quotes. Also, notice that each tax  rate has four decimal places. In your text editor, save the file in the UNIX format. For example, in TedNPad you  select File  Save in Unix as shown:  2.   Notice that I've named the file TaxRates.txt. The filename extension really  doesn't matter, as long as the file is text-only, saved in the UNIX format, and follows  the format that we saw.

A Tax Rule is composed of a Customer Class, Product Class, Tax Rate, and the location of the  purchaser. We have just created the third part of that formula: the Tax Rates. Each Tax Rate  included the location and the percentage of tax. We created these Tax Rates by exporting a  template from Magento. We opened this template in Excel, entered the tax rates, and saved  it as a text file. Finally, we imported the Tax Rates back into Magento.  Time for action: Creating a Tax Rule Finally, after creating the Customer Tax Classes, Product Tax Classes, and Tax Rates Zones  that we need, we are ready to create Tax Rules. For our demo store, we will need only one  Tax Rule.  Retail customers who purchase non-food items within Pennsylvania  including Philadelphia   pay sales tax.

[ 94 ]   Chapter 4  Summary  In this chapter, we saw how a Tax Rule combines the zone rate, product type, and purchaser  type into a Rule that determines the tax on a product. We created these components first,  and then combined them into a Rule.  Now that we have created Categories, Attributes, and Tax Rules, we are ready to add  Products to our store.  [ 95 ]    5  Adding Simple Products  In Magento, you can add a Simple Product, a Grouped Product, or a  Configurable Product. Until you have added several Simple Products, the other  two choices don't make much sense.   The following is the procedure for adding a simple product, which is divided  into seven parts.  Part 1: Adding the Product and assigning an Attribute Set  In this part of the process, you will create the blank Product and select an Attribute Set for  the Product. The Attribute Set will determine which Attributes are available for the Product.  Once you have assigned an Attribute Set to a Product, you cannot remove that  Set and apply a different one.  The Product now permanently uses that Attribute Set. You can edit the Set under Catalog   Attributes. This will change the Attributes in the Set and, therefore, the Attributes that the  Product has. However, you cannot remove the Set from the Product.   Adding Simple Products  Time for action: Creating the Product and selecting an  Attribute Set  1.  Log in to your site's backend, which we call the Administrative Panel. 2.   Catalog  Manage Products as shown:  Select   The Manage Products page is displayed. Because you haven't added any products  yet, the list of products is blank as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 98 ]   3.  Click on Add Product. The Create Product Settings page is displayed.  Chapter 5.  4.   Select an   Attribute Set.  If you don't know what an Attribute Set is, stop here and read Chapter 3   before proceeding.  In our demo store, we will use the Attribute Set coffee-by-pound, which we created  in the previous chapter.  Once you assign an Attribute Set to a Product and select its Product Type, these  cannot be changed. Therefore, make sure that before you create a Product, you  have chosen the correct Product Type, and you have created the Attribute Set  that you want to use.  5.  Leave Product Type set to Simple Product. Until you have added several Simple  Products, the other two choices  Grouped Product and Configurable Product    don't make much sense.  [ 99 ]   Adding Simple Products  6.   Click on  following screenshot:  Continue. The Product Information page is displayed as shown in the   This page is divided into tabs, which you see listed on the left side. We won't discuss  all of the fields in all of the tabs. Instead, we'll cover the fields and tabs that you are  most likely to use when you are first creating your store. The General tab is selected for you. Let's begin there.  What just happened? We just created a new, blank Simple Product. This is the most basic type of Product in  Magento. We assigned an Attribute Set to that Product, which gives it a list of Attributes.   The rest of this process will mostly consist of entering values for those Attributes.  [ 100 ]   Part 2: The General tab  When Magento displays a product in your store, that product appears on its own page.   Most of the information that your shoppers see on that page is entered in the General tab:  Chapter 5.  Notice that several fields on this page are marked with red asterisks. These fields are  required, so you must fill them. There is also a required field under the Prices tab.  You must fill in the required fields under the General and Prices tabs before  leaving the New Product page. Even if you save your work, the product will not  be added to your store if you haven't filled in the required fields.  [ 101 ]   Adding Simple Products  Time for action: Filling the fields on the General tab Each of the fields in the General tab is described next. Fill in the fields for your Product.  1.   , Description, and Short Description  Name Your customers will see the product Name at the top of the product's page. A Short  Description appears below it, and a Description below it.  When shoppers List the products in a Category, they also see the Name and Short  Description as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 102 ]   Chapter 5.  2.   3.   SKU SKU stands for Stock Keeping Unit. This is a standard term in the retail industry. Each  item in your store must have a unique SKU.

Usually, this field holds the shipping weight,   and not the actual weight of the product. You usually put the actual weight of   the product in the product's description. You usually use this field for calculating   the cost of shipping. For example, the Product Description for the laptop  states that it weighs 2.84  pounds. However, the shipping weight would be much higher because it includes   the box, accessories, packaging, and manuals. Our coffee store is an exception because we sell products by weight. So, we will   take the unusual step of using the Weight field for the product's actual weight.  Most of our coffee will be sold in one-pound bags. However, if we want to offer   a half-pound or two-pound bag, we'll need to create separate products for each   of them.  [ 103 ]   Adding Simple Products  4.    and Set Product as New to Date  Set Product as New from Date The default layout for Magento's home page shows blocks that display the shopper's  recently viewed products, and products that the shopper chooses to compare. You  can also add some code to your store's home page that will display new products.  The new products will appear at the bottom of the page. Magento can also put   new products into an RSS feed and send email announcements of new products,   for customers who subscribe. A new product can be included in the new product display, RSS feed, and or   email announcement. Setting dates in the fields for Set Product as New from to Date makes the product  "new" to Magento. If you use any of the above features, you will need to fill in these  date fields. However, if you don't highlight "new" products in your store, you can  safely leave these fields blank. Status Enabled makes this product active and displays it in your store. Disabled makes this  product inactive and hides it from shoppers. I prefer to keep a product Disabled until  I've filled out all the tabs, and double-checked my work. URL key Some features can cause a web page to rank higher in search engines. Designing   a page to appear as high as possible in search engines is called search engine   optimization, or SEO. It is part science and part art. A full discussion is beyond   the scope of this chapter. One feature that helps a page's search engine rank is a URL that has relevant search  terms in it. For example, brew-me-a-cup.com product 1234 is not a search en- gine friendly URL. However, brew-me-a-cup.com kona-fancy-wholebean gives  a search engine more information to index. The URL key field creates a search engine friendly URL. Because a URL cannot have  spaces or special characters; you cannot use them in this field. If you leave this field  blank, Magento will generate a search engine friendly URL for you. It will base this  URL on the product's Name. Visibility This field determines whether the product will not display at all in your site    Nowhere , display on the pages of your site  Catalog , show up in search results   Search , or both  Catalog, Search . Note that even if a product's Status is set to   Enabled, you must have its Visibility set to Catalog or Search, or your shoppers  won't be able to see or find it. If you have the Status set to Disabled, then the   Product won't show up in the Catalog no matter what you've set the Visibility   to. However, you can set Visibility to Search for a Disabled product.  5.   6.   7.   [ 104 ]   Chapter 5.  8.   9.   Allow Gift Message This field determines if customers can add a gift message to this product during  checkout. Yes and No are self-explanatory. Use config means that for this product,  Magento will use the sitewide setting for gift messages. You will find that setting  under System  Sales  Sales  Gift Messages. Save In the upper right corner of the New Product page, there are two buttons:   and Continue to Pricing  Save will save what you have entered into this tab, and advance you to the next tab.  Save and Continue Edit will save the information that you entered and keep you on  the same tab. Because there is a required field on the next tab, you will want to Save  this tab and proceed to the Prices tab. This is because you must fill in all required  fields before the system will allow you to save the product.  What just happened? Now that you have filled in values for the Attributes on the General tab, you are halfway in  completing the minimum information for this Product.   You have a few fields under Prices to fill out. Then, it's on to the optional information under  the rest of the tabs.  Under the Prices tab, you enter all of the pricing information for the product. This includes:  Part 3: The Prices tab           Price  The normal  A  Your   Special Price  Cost for the product  [ 105 ]   Adding Simple Products  Time for action: Entering pricing for the Product Each of the fields under the Prices tab is described in the following subsections—fill in the  required fields plus any optional fields that you want to use:  1.   2.   3.   Special Price If you enter a Special Price, the original Price will be displayed with a red line  through it, and the Special Price will be displayed. If you do not enter any dates, the  Special Price will be in effect until you remove it. If you do enter dates, the Special  Price will be in effect during the dates specified. This is not the only place where you can determine the price of a product. You can  also use an advanced feature called a Shopping Cart Price Rule. This rule can change  the price of a product based on what other products are in the Shopping Cart. A  Shopping Cart Price Rule takes effect in the Shopping Cart during the checkout   process so that customers don't see them until they've added the Product to their  carts. A Special Price is displayed on the catalog page so customers see it before  they add the Product to their carts. Tax Class The Tax Class that you select here determines how the product gets taxed.  If you don't know what a Tax Class and a Tax Rule are, stop here and read  Chapter 4 before proceeding.  In our demo store, we will give this Product a Tax Class of Food. Tier Pricing Tier Pricing enables you to give different prices for different quantities. Usually, you  use this to give a discount for buying in bulk. You can apply tiered pricing to all, or to  certain groups of customers.  There is more about Tiered Pricing in Chapter 7.  What just happened? Your product now contains pricing information. You have completed all of the mandatory  information for a product. Now, it's on to the optional information under the rest of the tabs.  Part 4: The Meta Information tab  The Meta Keywords and Meta Description appear under meta tags, in the page's HTML  code. Enter information about this Product that you think will help search engines to  properly categorize this page.  [ 106 ]   Chapter 5.  A meta tag contains information not normally displayed to the user. The word meta means  about this subject and the meta tags contain information about the page. Webmasters use  meta tags to tell search engines about a page, and to help search engines better categorize  that page.  You can see the meta tags in a page if you view the pages' source code.  Time for action: Entering Meta information  1.  For Meta Title, enter the title for this Product page. The keywords should be search   2.   3.   Meta Keywords, enter keywords that describe this Product. The keywords should   terms that customers will use when searching for this kind of a product. For  be search terms that customers will use when searching for this kind of product. For  Meta Description, enter a single sentence, or phrase, that describes the   Product. If a potential customer found this Product on a search site such as   Google or Teoma, what description would you like the customer to see? That is   what you should enter here.  What just happened? You have used Meta Keywords and Meta Description as opportunities to optimize the  Product's page for search engines.  Part 5: The Images tab  By default, Magento uses three images for each Product: base, small, and thumbnail. The  base image is displayed on the Product's home page. The small image is displayed when a  Product appears in a list of other Products, such as when you are viewing a Category landing  page. The thumbnail image appears in the Shopping Cart, and in blocks that show recently  added items and other items that the customer may be interested in. Before you upload: Resizing images The default stylesheet in Magento usually displays thumbnail images at 50-by-50 or 75-by-75  pixels. Small images are usually displayed at 125-by-125 or 135-by-135 pixels. Base images  are usually displayed at 265-by-265 pixels. You can upload any size image, and Magento  will resize it when displaying the image. However, there are some advantages to sizing the  images yourself.  First, while Magento does a good job of resizing the images, it is not a graphic editing  application. Some images will look better if you resize them with a specialized graphic editing  software such as PhotoShop or GIMP. If you want to be sure of the resized image's quality, do  it yourself instead of depending upon Magento.  [ 107 ]   Adding Simple Products  Second, resizing an image yourself enables you to preview the image at the final display size.  For example, suppose you upload the following image for one of your Products:  The size of this image is 400-by-267 pixels. On a computer monitor that displays 96 dots per  inch, the image would be about 4.2-by-2.8 inches. At this size, you can see that it is a pile   of grounded coffee. However, if you let Magento resize this image to 75-by-75 pixels,   it becomes unrecognizable.  Instead of depending upon Magento to resize the image, let's crop and resize it ourselves.   It now looks as follows:  Remember that the base image is displayed on the Product's home page. If the base image  that you upload is larger than 265-by-265 pixels, shoppers will be able to zoom in and see  more detail.  [ 108 ]   Chapter 5.  To summarize, before uploading images for your Product, you should at least crop the images  to fill the space with as much Product as possible. For a thumbnail image, crop the image so  that the subject will be recognizable at 75-by-75 pixels, or about three quarters of an inch  square. Magento will resize images for you. However, if you want to be sure about how they  will look at various sizes, resize the images in a graphics program before you upload them.  Time for action: Uploading images After you have created your Product images, it is time to upload them. The following are the  steps to upload your images:  1.  2.   On the  Click on  for uploading.  Product Information page, select the Images tab. Browse Files...; a dialog box appears, where you select one file    3.  Select an image to upload, and then click on the Open or OK button in the    4.   dialog box. If you want the same image to be used for the base, small, and thumbnail images,  you can move to the next step. If you want to use separate images for all the three  images, then click on Browse Files... and select more images.  [ 109 ]   Adding Simple Products  5.   After you select all the images that you want for this Product, click on  Upload Files.  The files will be uploaded to the images page as shown in the following screenshot:  6.   Select the image that you want for  clicking the radio buttons, which can be seen in the following screenshot:  Base Image, Small Image, and Thumbnail by   7.  To exclude an image type, click on the radio button in the top row for No Image.   This means that wherever Magento would have used that image size, no image will  be displayed. For example, the thumbnail image appears in the Shopping Cart. If  you select No Image for the Thumbnail image, then no image will be added when  this is placed in the Shopping Cart. You might use No Image when you are selling  something for which an image doesn't make sense. For example, if you're selling a  repair service you might not need an image.  [ 110 ]   8.  9.   Enter a  Click on   Label for each image. This will be used as the "alt text" for that image. Save And Continue Edit.  Chapter 5.  What just happened? You should now have at least one image, and possibly several more, for your Product. Each  image should be optimized for the size at which it will display. You have also entered the alt  text for each image.  The Design tab is next on the menu. We will skip that tab because it is beyond the scope of a  beginner's guide. Instead, let's proceed to the Inventory tab.  Part 6: The Inventory tab  Notice that all of the settings on the Inventory tab, except for Qty and Stock Availability, use  the global configuration as shown:  [ 111 ]   Adding Simple Products  You will find these global inventory settings under System  Configuration  Catalog   Inventory. Look at the following screenshot:  Let's return to the Product's Inventory tab and examine each of these fields. Remember  that except for Qty and Stock Availability, each of these fields is found on both the Product  and system configuration pages. Choose the one you want to edit  the Product or the Global  settings  and navigate to that page. Next, select a setting for each of the following fields.   The following table shows the settings that we used for our demo store:  [ 112 ]   Field  Explanation  Appears  in Catalog   Manage  Products   Product   Inventory  Appears  in System   Configuration   Catalog   Inventory  Manage Stock     Qty    Set Items'  Status to be   In Stock When  Order is  Cancelled Decrease Stock  When Order   is Placed Backorders  Maximum Qty  Allowed in  Shopping Cart Qty for Items'  Status to  become Out   of Stock  Minimum Qty  Allowed in  Shopping Cart Notify for  Quantity Below Qty Uses  Decimals                            Chapter 5.  If this is set to Yes, then by default Magento will  keep track of inventory for a Product. If it's set to  No, then Magento will not keep track of inventory  and all the other settings are irrelevant for the  Product. The individual setting for the Product  overrides the setting for the System. This is the quantity that you have in stock.  This will "return" items to stock when an order  with that item is cancelled. Otherwise, you must  manually return the item to stock   by adding it to the quantity field.  This global setting makes Magento automatically  deduct items from the quantity when those items  are ordered. This setting determines if you allow customers to  backorder an item that is out of stock. The maximum quantity allowed in one order.  If the number in stock falls below this threshold, it  is shown as Out of Stock. If   you run both an online and physical store,   you might want to keep a few items on the shelf,  so you would set this to some number above zero. The minimum quantity allowed in one order.  When the quantity in stock drops below this  number, Magento emails the store administrator. This enables shoppers to order a quantity   that is something other than a whole number. For  example, 1.5 pounds of coffee.  [ 113 ]   Adding Simple Products  Field  Explanation  Appears  in System   Configuration   Catalog   Inventory  Appears  in Catalog   Manage  Products   Product   Inventory   Stock  Availability  Magento automatically sets this to In Stock or  Out of Stock based upon the quantity in stock,  and the minimum quantity for the item's status  to be In Stock. However, you can override this  by changing the field yourself. For example,  suppose you are out of stock and want to sell a  floor model. The floor model is not part of your  stock. Therefore, you don't want to add it to your  quantity in stock. But because your quantity in  stock is zero, Magento won't let you take orders  for this Product. You could set Stock Availability to  Yes, and that would enable you to take an order  for the Product.  Time for action: Setting the global and Product  inventory options  1.   2.   If this is the first Product that you have added, navigate to   Catalog  Inventory and set the global default values. If you open the system  configuration page in a new tab, you can keep the Product's Inventory tab open  while you do this. Under the Product's  enter a value to override the default.  Inventory tab, either select the default value for each field or   System  Configuration   What just happened? At this point, you have set global inventory options for your Products. You also have set the  inventory options for at least one individual Product. These settings will determine whether  a Product is marked as In Stock. At this point you will be reminded to re-order, how much a  customer can order, and other related functions.  [ 114 ]   Chapter 5.  Part 7: The Categories tab  You can select more than one Category for a Product.  Time for action: Selecting Categories  1.   Under the  shown in the following screenshot:  Categories tab, select the Categories in which this Product will reside as   What just happened? By putting your Product into at least one Category, you made it a part of your online catalog.  When a customer explores that Category, the customer will see the Product among those  listed in that Category.  Covered elsewhere: Promotions  The remaining tabs are optional. These tabs are used to promote this and related Products.  They are covered in Chapter 7.  Summing up  So far, we have:  1.  2.  3.  4.  5.   Created Categories. Created Attributes. Created an Attribute Set. Created a Tax Rule. Added a Product.  [ 115 ]   Adding Simple Products  As you can see from the list, the largest part of adding a Product is the work that comes  before you actually add it. It is more efficient to create all the Categories, Attributes, and  Tax Rules that you will need before you start adding Products. However, that rarely happens  in the real world. When adding a Product, you should be prepared to create Categories,  Attributes, and Tax Rules as needed.  Pop quiz  1.   Which of the following cannot be changed once you've created a Product?  The Product Name. The Product Type  simple, compound, and so on . The Category to which you've assigned the Product.  2.

For a Product to show up in your catalog and in search results, you must set its:  Summary  In this chapter, we saw how to add a Product and the Product Information. In the next  chapter, we will see what parts of the standard store layout need to be modified, and what  parts can be left untouched. Remember that the purpose of this quick-start guide is to get  you selling as soon as possible. So, we will not cover extensive customizing of your Magento  store. Instead, we will cover only the customizing that is needed.  [ 116 ]   6  Minimum Customization of   Your Store's Appearance  When you install Magento, it creates a default storefront. This storefront  uses some of Magento's optional features, such as callouts, to display ads  and a newsletter subscription on the front page. It also uses a fictional logo  and a welcome message on the front page. All of these features need to be  customized for your storefront.  Let's see what our store looks like so far. We will look at both a Category page and the   front page.  Our store so far  Let's look at the features of the default Magento store. Later in the chapter, we will learn  how to customize each of these.   Minimum Customization of Your Store's Appearance  The default Category page The default Category page contains many features in common with the default front page,  and some that are unique to the Category page.  The Layered Navigation Menu  Notice the Shop By block in the upper left corner? This is   the Layered Navigation Menu. This menu holds the Attributes  that we designated as filterable. If this Category had any Child  Categories, they would also appear in the Layered   Navigation Menu.  [ 118 ]   Blocks: My Cart, Compare Products, and Recently Viewed Products  Chapter 6  These blocks appear by default. The Magento Designer's  Guide contains extensive instructions on how to  customize the content and layout of your store pages.  However, you do not need to customize these blocks  for your store to function. Therefore, for this quick- start guide, we will not learn how to customize these  standard blocks.  The Magento Designer's Guide can be found at   http:  www.magentocommerce.com design_guide.  Callouts In the default layout, you can see two callouts on each catalog page: Did you know? and  Back to School. These are the graphics on the left and right. Obviously, these callouts are not  appropriate for most stores. We will learn how to remove or replace them with callouts that  are appropriate for your store.  Newsletter  Magento's default front page contains a block that  enables your customers to sign up for your newsletter.  We will learn how to hide this block.   [ 119 ]   Minimum Customization of Your Store's Appearance Community Poll  Magento's default front page contains a block that  displays a single-question survey, or a poll. We will  learn how to hide this block.   Welcome message  Store name  In the upper right corner of the  page, notice Default welcome  msg!. We will learn how to  customize this welcome message.  In the upper left corner of the page, notice the store  name, Magento Demo Store. We will learn how to  customize the store name and logo.  [ 120 ]   The default front page The default front page is simpler than the default Catalog page. However, it does have   some links at the bottom of the page that are also on the catalog pages as shown in the  following screenshot:  Chapter 6  [ 121 ]   Minimum Customization of Your Store's Appearance The default About Us and Customer Service pages The default About Us and Customer Service pages contain dummy text and a graphic that  you can edit as shown in the following screenshot:  Later, we will learn how to customize these pages. Because the process for customizing the  About Us and Customer Service pages is the same, we cover them together.  The Site Map, Search Terms, Advanced Search, and Contact Us links Like almost everything else in Magento, you can customize these links. However, you may  not need to customize them for your store to function. We will not cover customizing these  links in this quick-start guide.  [ 122 ]   Customize the Layered Navigation Menu  Chapter 6  Notice that the Layered Navigation Menu enables the  shopper to filter Products by three Attributes: Caffeine,  Character, and Price.  In the following screenshot of the Manage Attributes page, you can see two of the Attributes  that we created: caffeine and character. They have been designated as Filterable as shown  in the following screenshot:  Because these two Attributes are filterable, and not blank, they appear in the Layered  Navigation Menu. Remember, only Anchor Categories appear in the Layered Navigation  Menu, and then you will see the filterable Attributes under those Categories.  You can also see one of Magento's default Attributes, color, which is also filterable. However,  color does not appear in the Shop By block because we did not make it visible, as you can  see from the No option in the third column.  Most store owners choose to use the Layered Navigation Menu. If you don't want to use  it, you can edit your site's templates to remove that block. However, that is unnecessarily  complicated. Instead, simply make all of the Attributes that you use not filterable, and the  block will disappear.  [ 123 ]   Minimum Customization of Your Store's Appearance  Customize the Callouts  Let's look at how we can customize the default callouts. Notice that the callouts display in  the left and right columns:  Now look at the default front page. Notice that it does not have a column to the left of the  main area. Therefore, the left callout is not displayed on the front page. However, the   right column and the right callout are displayed on the front page as shown in the   following screenshot:  [ 124 ]   Chapter 6  The left callout, which does not appear on the front page, links to your store's Shopping Cart.  To customize these callouts, you will need to do two things:  1.  2.   Replace the default graphic for each callout. Replace the default alt text for each callout.  Both are covered in the next section.  Time for action: Replacing the default graphic for a callout 1.  Before replacing a graphic for a callout, you should create its replacement.    The following default callout graphics is 195-pixels wide:  [ 125 ]   Minimum Customization of Your Store's Appearance  2.   Make sure that you have named the new graphic  col_left_callout.jpg, whichever one you are replacing.  col_right_callout.jpg or    3.  Navigate to the Magento directory \skin\frontend\default\default\images\media. 4.  Rename the existing  col_right_callout.jpg or col_left_callout.jpg to something else,  such as ORIGINAL_col_right_callout.jpg.This preserves the original graphic so that  you can roll back to the original condition. Copy your new graphic into  it col_right_callout.jpg or col_left_callout.jpg, whichever one you are replacing.  \skin\frontend\default\default\images\media and name   5.   Replacing the default alt text for a callout If your customer's browser is unable to display a graphic, it will display the alternative text  for that graphic instead. We call this alt text. Also, search engines use a graphic's alt text to  help them classify a page. When you replace the graphic for your callout s , you should also  replace the alt text for those graphics.  [ 126 ]   Chapter 6  Time for action: Replacing the alt text for the right callout 1.  Navigate to the Magento directory \app\design\frontend\default\default\  right_col.phtml.  template\callouts. Locate the file  Before changing the file, make a duplicate of it. Name it to something like  ORIGINAL_right_col.phtml. Open the file in a text editor such as WordPad, or in an HTML editor such   as DreamWeaver. In the text file, locate the alt text as shown in the following screenshot:  2.  3.   4.   5.   [ 127 ]   Minimum Customization of Your Store's Appearance  6.  Replace the alt text with your own, as shown in the following screenshot:  7.   Save the file.  \app\design\frontend\default\default\layout.  Time for action: Replacing the alt text and the link for the  left callout  1.  2.  3.   4.   5.   catalog.xml.  Navigate to the Magento directory  Locate the file  Before changing the file, make a duplicate of it. Name it to something like  ORIGINAL_catalog.xml. Open the file in a text editor such as WordPad, or in an HTML editor such   as DreamWeaver. Locate the default alt text. An easy way to do this is to use the search for    800  DEMO-NUMBER.  [ 128 ]   Chapter 6  6.  Replace the alt text with your own. 7.  In the next line, notice the link: checkout cart. Replace this with a link of your   choice. For example, you could use one of the following links:  To link to this page in your store: Customer Service Contact Us  Replace the default link with this text: customer-service contacts  8.   Save the file.  [ 129 ]   Minimum Customization of Your Store's Appearance  What just happened? You just replaced the graphics, alt text, and links for the callouts. To do this, you needed to  go outside of Magento and work with files directly in Magento's directory. You might not see  a change in your page yet, which we will address in the next section.  Turning off the cache and testing the page At this point, if you display and refresh a page, you probably won't see the new link. Why  would Magento still display the old link for the callout? Let's take a quick detour from  customizing the store and talk about Magento's page cache.  As we performed the customizations, we had to navigate through the many folders that  make up your Magento installation. There are thousands of files in Magento. When you  view a Magento page, you see the result of Magento assembling many different files and  displaying them together. Assembling a page takes time and processing power.  Magento holds pages that it displays in a separate storage area called the cache. For  example, suppose a shopper navigates to the Single Origin Coffees category page. Magento  will assemble this page, display it for the shopper, and store the page in its cache. When the  next shopper asks for the Single Origin Coffees category page, Magento retrieves the page  from its cache. This is faster than assembling the page again.  Magento's cache speeds up the display of pages reducing the load on the server. However,  it has a disadvantage. After you customize your store, Magento might hold on to the old  versions of pages. Instead of assembling the latest version of a page, sometimes Magento  will display the old, cached version. To correct this, we usually turn off the cache while  customizing our storefront. When we finish with our changes, we turn the cache on again.  Time for action: Turning the page cache off  1.  2.   3.  4.  5.    Admin interface, select System  Cache Management.  From the  You can select which types of information Magento will cache. However, when  performing the basic customization on your site, it is usually easiest to enable and  disable all of them at once. From the drop-down menu next to  Click on the  Refresh the page that you are testing.  All Cache, select Disable or Enable.  Save cache settings button.  [ 130 ]   What just happened? By turning off Magento's cache, you have ensured that any changes you make to your pages  will show up as soon as you refresh them in your browser. However, you have also increased  the load on your web server. When you're done with developing your site, you will want to  turn the cache back on.  Chapter 6  Disabling the Newsletter or Poll  Customizing and using the newsletter feature is covered later book when we discuss about  customer relationships . If you are not going to publish a newsletter soon, you might want  to disable this feature for now. Also, if you are not going to customize the poll, you should  disable it.  Time for action: Disabling the Newsletter or Poll  1.  Go to System  Configuration  Advanced  Advanced. You should see the Disable   modules output page. Locate the module labeled  Click on the   Save Config button.  2.  3.   Mage_Newsletter and or Mage_Poll, and select Disable.  What just happened? When you refresh your front page, the newsletter and or poll block should disappear. Later,  you can customize and re-enable them.  [ 131 ]   Minimum Customization of Your Store's Appearance  Customize the welcome message  From the Admin interface, select System  Configuration  General  Design.  This page enables you to customize several items. For now, let's look at the ones that   are necessary.  The HTML Head section Recall that we talked about metadata when creating a product. Metadata helps search  engines to determine the content of a web page, and to categorize the page. The HTML  Head section enables you to customize the metadata for your entire store. The data you  enter into the fields on this page will appear in the header of each page in your store. Your  shoppers won't see this data, but search engines will. Default Title If a page in your site does not have a customized title, then it will use the title given here. For  example, when you created products, each Product page used the name of the Product as its  title. All of Magento's built-in pages have their own titles, and so this field should not affect  your system unless you create custom pages.  [ 132 ]   Chapter 6  Default Description This is your store's description. Some search sites will display this to their searchers. Treat this  like a one-sentence marketing piece designed to entice searchers to click through to your store.  Default Keywords Enter keywords that will help search engines to classify your site.  The Header section The fields in this section are used to customize the logo and the welcome message.  Logo Image Src and Alt Text By default, Magento looks in \skin\frontend\default\default\images\logo.gif  for the store's logo. The graphic is 157-by-47 pixels in size. The easiest way to customize your  store's logo is to make a direction replacement, the same size and file name, and replace the  existing one.  The field Logo Image Alt holds the alt text for the logo. This will be displayed if the graphic is  not displayed.  Welcome Text Enter your customized welcome message into this field.  The Footer section  On this page, you can change the Copyright notice. This is the last line in the   previous screenshot.  The links About Us, Customer Service, and Contact Us are customized elsewhere, as is the  message immediately above the copyright notice.  There is also a field on the configuration page for Miscellaneous HTML. This enables you  to add any HTML code immediately below the copyright. For example, you can add Google  Analytics, or some other code, to help you track visitors on your site.  [ 133 ]   Minimum Customization of Your Store's Appearance  Using new themes  Your store's layout, terminology, colour scheme, typestyles, and images are controlled by its  theme. Creating an entirely new theme for your site is beyond the scope of this book. Covering  it will require an entire book by itself. However, you can easily replace your site's default theme  with a theme that someone has built for you. In addition to many paid themes, you can find  plenty of free themes on the web as well.  The files for your store's theme reside in these two directories:  1.   2.    app design frontend default default  layout, translations for the labels and terms, and templates.  —This directory contains the    skin frontend default default  sheets, and JavaScript for the blocks.  —This directory contains images, style   The last part of those paths,  default, is the name of the theme that comes with Magento,  default theme. When you install a new theme, you will place its files under  app design  frontend default and  skin frontend default. For example, I downloaded the  free Linen theme from www.magthemes.com, and copied its files into  app design  frontend default linen and  skin frontend default linen.  When I unzipped the package for the Linen theme, it contained these directories:         skin frontend LinenTheme default  app design frontend LinenTheme default  Time for action: Installing a theme To install this theme, perform the following steps:  1.   2.   3.   skin frontend LinenTheme default to skin frontend   app design frontend LinenTheme default to app design   Rename  LinenTheme linen.

In the Admin interface, navigate to System  Configuration  General  Design. You   should see a section on that page labeled as Themes:  [ 135 ]   Minimum Customization of Your Store's Appearance  6.  In the fields Templates, Skin, Layout, and Default, type the name of the directory for   the new theme. In this case, type linen into each of those fields:  7.  Save the configuration. 8.  Refresh the frontend. You should see the new theme applied to your store as shown   in the following screenshot:  [ 136 ]   Chapter 6  What just happened? Notice that this theme changed the store's appearance in several ways. Now, only one  callout is displayed, and it is not one of the callouts that we customized. Also, the logo has  changed. It is no longer the one which we customized. If we want to preserve the graphics  that we customized, we need to move them into the  images directory of the new theme.  Changing your store's name  Out of the box, Magento gives your store the name Default Store View. This name appears  in several places, such as when a customer creates an account on your site.  You should change this to your store's name.  [ 137 ]   Minimum Customization of Your Store's Appearance  Time for action: Change your store's name  1.  From the Admin interface, select System  Manage Stores. 2.   Click the link for  as shown in the following screenshot:  Default Store View. The Store View Information page is displayed   3.  In the Name field, enter the name for your store that you want customers to see.  4.  Click on Save Store View.  What just happened? Now whenever Magento displays your store name, it will show the text that you entered in  the Name field.  Summary  Magento enables you to customize almost every aspect of your store's appearance. A  complete customization requires you to create a new theme, which is beyond the scope of  this book. However, you can easily customize the default Magento installation in significant  ways. Without getting into making a new theme, you can still make your store unique.  If you plan on customizing the logo, callouts, or any other graphics; and installing a new  theme  either free or paid for , install the new theme first. Once the installation is complete,  customize the elements of the new theme. If you customize the elements on your store's  default theme, and then replace the default theme with a new theme, you will have wasted  time customizing the default theme.  [ 138 ]   7  Beyond Simple Products  In Chapter 5 you learned how to add Simple Products to your store. Magento  enables you to go beyond that and offer more complex Products. These include  Related Products, Grouped Products, and Configurable Products  When you offer Related Products with a Simple Product, they are displayed in the Related  Products block when a customer views the Simple Product. Related Products are meant to  be bought along with a Simple Product. Consider using this feature when you want to sell  accessories or add-ons for a Simple Product.  Grouped Products are groups of Products that are meant to be purchased together such   as a suit jacket and suit pants.  A Configurable Product is a Product in which the customer gets to choose an attribute s    of the Product such as the color, size, or material.  You can also offer discounts for buying in quantity, by using tiered pricing.  Related Products  You can display Related Products for any Product in your catalog. These will appear in the  Related Products block. Related Products are meant to be purchased in addition to the  Product the customer is viewing.   Beyond Simple Products  In our demonstration store, we sell several kinds of whole-bean coffee. For each of these  Products, we want to display a coffee grinder as the Related Product:  By default, the RELATED PRODUCTS block appears in the upper right corner of the page.  On web pages, this is considered a highly visible spot. The block appears only if you have  designated at least one related Product.  This block will not appear if the customer is viewing a Configurable Product, even if one of its  configurations has a Related Product. The block appears only for Simple Products.  Notice the checkbox next to the Related Product. If a customer selects a Related Product and  adds the main Product to the Shopping Cart, the Related Product will also be added. If  s he  doesn't add the main Product, the Related Product will not be added.  Time for action: Adding related Product s  to a Product Follow these steps to add related Products to a Product.  1.  From the Admin interface, select Catalog  Manage Products. 2.  3.   The list of Products in your store will be displayed. Click anywhere on the Product that you want to edit.

If this Product has several Related Products, specify the order in which they will appear  by entering a number in the Position field, which is in the column to the far right. Click on   Save.  What just happened? The Related Products that you specified will now be displayed whenever a customer views  this Product.  [ 141 ]   Beyond Simple Products  Grouped Products  A Grouped Product is a shortcut for simultaneously adding several Products to the Shopping  Cart. A Grouped Product is not really a Product. It is a group of Products that is displayed  together. A Grouped Product can include both Simple and Configurable Products.  In the following example, you can see that our Single Origin Sampler consists of three  separate Simple Products:  When a customer clicks on the Grouped Product's name, or the Add to Cart button,  s he is  taken to the Grouped Product's page:  [ 142 ]   Chapter 7  On this page, the customer chooses the quantity and adds the Grouped Product to the  Shopping Cart. Notice that a Grouped Product's page clearly lists the individual Products   that make up the Grouped Product. Also, notice that the system has filled in a quantity for  the customer. When you create a Grouped Product, you specify a default quantity for each   of its Products. While the quantity is initially set, the customer can override it and enter   new quantities.  Creating a Grouped Product The process for creating a Grouped Product is almost the same as for a Simple Product.   It differs the most only in the last part of the process, when you select the Simple Products  that will belong to this Group.

For  Click on  following screenshot:  Continue. The Product Information page is displayed as shown in the   Product Type, select Grouped Product.  Notice that there are no tabs for Weight and Price. As the Grouped Product is   a collection of individual Products, its weight and price are the sum of the   individual Products.  [ 144 ]   Chapter 7  The procedure for creating a Group Product is almost identical to creating a  Simple Product. Because you need to create several individual Products before  creating a Group Product, these instructions assume that you know how to  create a Product. Therefore, they will focus on what is unique about creating a  Grouped Product. If you don't understand any part of these instructions, consider  reviewing the procedure for creating a Simple Product explained in Chapter 5.  What just happened? You now have a blank Grouped Product ready, in which you can fill in the details. After you  complete the tabs for this Grouped Product, you will add Simple Products to this group. The  General tab is selected for you. Let's begin there.  Time for action: Completing the General tab When Magento displays a product in your store, that product appears on its own page. Most  of the information that your shoppers see on that page is entered here, on the General tab.  Notice that several fields on this page are marked with red asterisks. These fields are  required, so you must fill them.  You must fill in the required fields under the General tab before leaving the New  Product page. Even if you save your work, the product will not be added to your  store if you haven't filled in the required fields.  1.   Name, Description, and Short Description.  Enter  The way these fields function is similar to the fields for Simple Product. Your   customers will see the product Name at the top of the product's page. The   Short Description field appears below that, in the section labeled Quick Overview.   The Description field appears below that.  2.  Enter a unique SKU.  A Grouped Product has an SKU, just like a Simple Product. However, when a   customer adds a Grouped Product to the Shopping Cart, the individual Product's  SKUs are added to the cart. The Grouped Product's SKU is not added to the Cart.  [ 145 ]   Beyond Simple Products  2.   3.   4.   5.   6.   7.   URL key.  Status for this Group.  Set Product as New from to Date.

Setting dates in the fields for Set product as new from to date  makes the product new to Magento. If you use any of these features, you will need  to fill in the date fields. However, if you don't highlight the new products in your  store, you can safely leave these fields blank. If any of the individual Products that make up the Grouped Product are new, they  will also appear as new in addition to the Grouped Product. Select a  Enabled makes this product active and displays it in your store. Disabled makes this  product inactive and hides it from shoppers.

[ 146 ]   Save will save what you have entered in this tab, and advance you to the next tab.  Save and Continue Edit will save the information that you entered, but keep you on  the same tab.  Chapter 7  What just happened? You have completed one of the required tabs for a Grouped Product. The only thing that  is required to create the product is to select the Simple Products that will be part of the  Grouped Product.  Time for action: Completing the Meta Information tab Use Meta Keywords and Meta Description as opportunities to optimize the page for   search engines.  1.   2.   3.

Meta Description, enter a single sentence or phrase that describes the Product.   What just happened? The meta information that you entered for this product will not make any visible difference  on the product's page. However, the meta information will be used by search engines to  categorize the product's page more accurately.  [ 147 ]   Beyond Simple Products  Time for action: Uploading images  1.  2.

For example, the thumbnail image appears in the Shopping Cart. If  you select No Image for the Thumbnail Image, then no image will be added when  this is placed in the Shopping Cart. You might use No Image when you are selling  something for which an image doesn't make sense. For example, if you're selling a  repair service you might not need an image. Enter  Click on   a Label for each image. This will be used as the "alt text" for that image.  Save And Continue Edit.  What just happened? The image s  that you uploaded will be displayed on the Grouped Product's page. The Design  tab is next on the menu. We will skip that tab because it is beyond the scope of a beginner's  guide. Instead, proceed to the Inventory tab.  Time for action: Completing the Inventory tab For a Grouped Product, there are only two settings under the Inventory tab: Manage Stock  and Stock Availability as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 149 ]   Beyond Simple Products  All of the other settings that you normally find under this tab are managed under   individual Products.  1.  2.

Now when a shopper visits  the page for the product,  s he will see a picture and description for the Group.  S he will  also see the individual Simple Products that will be added to the cart if the Group Product   is added.  [ 152 ]   Configurable Products  A Configurable Product is one where the customer gets to choose an attribute of the  Product. For example, a pair of shoes is a Configurable Product if the customer gets to  choose the size. Likewise, a shirt is also a Configurable Product if the customer can choose  the size and colour. In our demo store, we will create a Configurable Product by enabling  customers to choose the grind for a coffee.  Chapter 7  [ 153 ]   Beyond Simple Products  A Configurable Product is actually a collection of Simple Products. Think about a shoe  example. In the inventory, the store has many different sizes of the same model of shoe.  Each size is in a different shoebox, and has a different SKU. Each size is, essentially, a different  Product. When a shopper selects a specific size,  s he is really selecting a specific Product  with its own, unique SKU.   This means that for every choice you give your customers for a Configurable Product,   you need to create a Simple Product. For example, suppose you sell a shirt in the   following configurations:  Size small medium small medium large  Color blue blue red red red  SKU shsmbl shmebl shsmre shmere shlare  In this case, you would allow the customer to choose two Attributes for this Configurable  Product: size and color. Hence, you would create five Simple Products.  Creating a Configurable Product Before creating a Configurable Product, you should plan the Simple Products that you want  to be included in the Configurable Product.  Time for action: Designating some Attributes as configurable  This section assumes that you know how to create and use Attributes. This was  covered in Chapter 3.  1.  From the Admin interface, select Catalog  Attributes  Manage Attributes. A list of   2.   all Attributes in the system is displayed. Click on the Attribute that you want to make configurable.

Click on the  Make sure that the Attribute Set that you will use for this Configurable Product  contains the configurable Attribute s  that you just set up.  What just happened? You just designated an Attribute s  as configurable. Now, you can create a Configurable  Product based on that Attribute. This means that your shoppers will be able to choose a  value for that Attribute, and they will be shown a Product with that value.  This next section assumes that you know how to create Products. This was covered  in Chapter 5.  You must create the Products that will be associated with this Configurable Product. You will  create the first Product in the same way as you would any other Simple Product. If you need  complete instructions, refer to the instructions for creating a Simple Product in Chapter 5.  The following section contains just the key points that you must remember when creating a  Simple Product, which will be a part of a Configurable Product.  After creating the first Simple Product, you will duplicate it and use the duplicate as the  starting point for the next Simple Product. This section covers creating the first Simple  Product. The next section covers duplicating it and creating the rest of the Simple Products.  Time for action: Creating the first Simple Product that will be  associated to the Configurable Product  I1.  mmediately after clicking the Create Product button, the system displays a dialog   box where you select the Attribute Set and the Product Type.  [ 156 ]   2.   You must select an Attribute Set that has one or more configurable Attributes, such  as the one that was set up in the previous section. In our demo store, we selected coffee-by-pound because it contains the configurable  Attribute, grind.  Chapter 7  The Simple Products can differ in more than just the configurable attribute. For  example, suppose you sell t-shirts. Maybe all the small shirts are available only in  black, and all the medium-sized shirts are available in black and red. In that case,  you would make both size and color as configurable attributes. When a customer  selects the small size,  s he would see only black in the color selection column.  When  s he selects the medium size,  s he would see black and red in the color  selection. Both Attributes must be configurable, even if you're using them both  on only some of the Simple Products in this Configurable Product.  3.   4.   r Product Type, select Simple Product. Remember, you are creating one of the   Fo Products that will be associated with the Configurable Product. You are creating the  Configurable Product itself.

If you forget to do this, the Product  will show up as both a normal product with its own listing, and as a selection under  a Configurable Product. The following screenshot demonstrates that mistake. Notice  that all three Simple Products, which will be choices for the Configurable Product,  appear by themselves.  When I set the Visibility to Nowhere, these Products will disappear from the page. Fill in the rest of the information for this Product, just as you would for any other  Simple Product. If you need complete instructions, refer to the instructions for  creating a Simple Product enlisted in Chapter 5. Save the Product.   8.   9.   What just happened? You just created the first Simple Product that will be a part of the group of Products that  comprise this Configurable Product. Now you are ready to create duplicates of this Product,  and use each Duplicate as the starting point for a new Product.  To begin the next part of the procedure, you should keep open the Product that you want   to duplicate.

Select the  At the top of this page you will see sections labeled Create Simple Associated Prod- uct and Quick simple product creation. If you had not created the Simple Products  for this Configurable Product, you could use either of these to create a new Product.  As you have already created all the needed Products, you can skip these sections.  When you need to create a new Simple Product for this Configurable Product, you  will have three options:           Duplicate Use  Use    a Product, as you did earlier. Create Simple Associated Product. Quick simple product creation.  The last two options are shortcuts. They are not difficult to learn, however you   already know how to use the first option, and it doesn't take much longer than   the other two. At the bottom of the page, you will list all of the Simple Products that use the same  Attribute Set as this Configurable Product. Click on  search criterion and click on Search.

[ 164 ]   Chapter 7  Looking at the previous screenshot, you can see that Breakfast Blend Whole Bean  has a grind of wholebean. The first three Products in the list cannot be associated  because they also have a grind of wholebean. Each Associated Product must have  a unique setting for the configurable attributes. That is because when the customer  selects a setting for the configurable attribute, the customer should see only one  Product. In our example, you can assign only one Associated Product for each of  these settings:  wholebean, coarse, medium, and xtrafine. To select a Product, click to place a check mark in the first column.

Your Configurable Produce is complete. When customers view this product, they will be able  to select different values for the Attribute that you made configurable. When they select one  of these values, they will be selecting the individual Simple Product that has a value for that  specific Attribute.  [ 166 ]   Chapter 7  Tiered pricing  Tiered pricing enables you to give special prices for a specified group, or customers, and a  specified quantity. It is set under the Prices tab.  A tiered price has the following three components:  Customer Group: Who gets the special price?  1.  2.   3.   The  The minimum quantity   special price? The special   Price: It is also called the Tier Price.  Qty : How much must the customer buy to get the    Giving discounts for minimum quantities to all customers In the simplest case, you will give a discount to anyone who buys a minimum quantity.  In that case, you would create a single tier, and apply the Tier Price to ALL GROUPS. For  example, in the following screenshot of the Prices tab, you can see that this tier creates a  15% discount for buying three bags or more:  Notice that the normal price is $14.00 per pound. For the tier price, we wanted to give a 15%  discount. So, we calculated that $14.00 minus 15% is $11.90 per pound. Also, notice that the  Customer Group is set to ALL GROUPS.  [ 167 ]   Beyond Simple Products  In a more complex case, you could use multiple tiers. Once again, these tiers apply to   all customers.  When the product is listed in your catalogue, customers see the standard price and the  lowest price. Look at the following screenshot:  [ 168 ]   On the product's page, customers see the tier prices as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 7  When you give discounts to only selected groups of customers, the process becomes a little  more complex.  Looking ahead: Giving discounts to specified customer groups As stated earlier, a tiered price has three components. When setting up a tiered price for  everyone, we selected ALL GROUPS for the Customer Group. Magento comes with four   in-built customer groups, as shown in the following screenshot:  Under Customers  Customer Groups, you can create additional customer groups.  With customer groups, you can charge different tax rates for different kinds of customers. In  the above screenshot, you can see that one customer group is called Wholesale. This group  is taxed differently, as you can see from the Tax Class column.  [ 169 ]   Beyond Simple Products  You can also give different prices to different customer groups. This is done using the   tiered pricing.  A complete discussion of customer groups is beyond the scope of this quick-start guide.  However, if you need to offer different prices or tax rates to different types of customers,  customer groups enable you to do that.  Pop quiz  1.

[ 170 ]   Chapter 7  Summary  In this chapter, we walked through the process of creating a Simple Product, which is the  basis for the other product types. We then created a Group Product, which is a collection of  Simple Products that is added to a shopper's cart all at once. We also created a Configurable  Product. It is a collection of Simple Products that differ in one or more Attributes, and can be  chosen one at a time.  Magento contains other product types, which are not covered here. Mastering the creation  of Simple Products will enable you to learn about additional product types.  [ 171 ]    8  Customer Relationships  Magento sends emails to you and your customers under several conditions.  Customers receive emails when they create accounts, when they place orders,  and when their orders are shipped. The store administrator receives emails  when customers fill out the Contact Us form, and sometimes when the store  administrator creates an order for a customer  instead of the customer placing  the order online .  To make all of these email functions work correctly, you must configure them. In this chapter,  we will cover how to configure the most basic and necessary email functions. First, we will  cover the basic configuration that is needed for all of these email functions. Next, we will  cover the configuration of the Contact Us feature, which enables your customers to contact  you through a form on your site. Finally, we will learn how to manage customer accounts.  Configuring store email addresses  The email addresses that Magento uses to send and receive emails are set up under System   Configuration  Store Email Addresses. Have a look at the following screenshot:   Customer Relationships  Notice that each of the email addresses has fields labeled Sender name and Sender email.  These are outgoing email addresses. Magento sends emails, but does not receive them.   For example, suppose that Magento sends out a customer support email. Even though   the email came from Magento, to the customer it will appear to come from the Customer  support email address and the Sender name will be displayed in the email. This helps your  customers in two ways.  First, when your customer gets an email from Magento with a Sender name such as   Brew-Me-A-Cup Customer support,  s he knows immediately that the message is from   your store, and is not spam. Second, if you enter a working email address for the Sender  email, the customer can just click on Reply in his or her email application to reach you.  Time for action: Entering email addresses for your store Follow these steps to enter email addresses for your store:  System  Configuration  Store Email Addresses.  1.  2.   3.   Go to  At a minimum, you should enter the  and Customer support email addresses. Save the page.  General contact, Sales representative,    [ 174 ]   What just happened? The email addresses that you just entered will be used in your store's contact forms. When  your customers fill out one of these forms, their message will be sent to the email address s   that you entered here.  Chapter 8  Configuring Contact Us  Magento can give your visitors an online form that they can use to contact you. This can be  a better option than posting your email address on your store. Posting your email address  makes it vulnerable to being spammed. The address is likely to be harvested by spammers.  However, it is more difficult to spam an online form. Also, the online form prompts the  customer to enter all of the information that you need to help the customer.  By default, Magento puts a Contact Us link at the bottom of each page. This link takes you to  a Contact Us form at  index.php contacts .  Magento emails the contents of this form to the email address of your choice. You must  enter that email address and other configuration options for this form.  You can also disable this form. If you don't use the Contact Us function, consider putting  your contact information into one of the callouts so that customers are reassured they can  reach you.  [ 175 ]   Customer Relationships  Time for action: Configuring the Contact Us form  1.   2.  3.   ke sure that you have an email address that is set up to receive messages   Ma from the contact form.

The Contact Us form for your site is now configured. Messages sent using this form will now  be sent to and will appear to come from the email address that you configured.  Chapter 8  Managing customers  In Magento, a customer is any shopper who has created an account in your store. In this  quick-start guide, we differentiate customers from shoppers—customers have accounts,   and shoppers are just visitors to your store's site.  When a customer creates an account,  s he fills out the new user form. This form doesn't  require the customer to fill in personal information, although that can be entered in the  customer's profile later:  [ 177 ]   Customer Relationships  Advantages of having customer accounts Using customer accounts on your site has advantages for your customers as well as for you.  Before we learn how to manage customers, let's discuss some of the advantages.  Advantages for the customer From the customer's point of view, creating an account in your store has several advantages.  For example, a customer can store addresses for billing, shipping, and alternative addresses   such as a work address for taking delivery during the day .  During the checkout process, a customer can select the following addresses that  s he has  stored in the profile, instead of typing them every time  s he orders:  Customers can also track their orders as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 178 ]   Chapter 8  Finally, customers can review and tag Products, and create wish lists.  Advantages for the administrator From the store administrator's point of view, there are also advantages when your customers  create accounts on your site. When a shopper places several orders with your store, you can't  guarantee that the shopper will use the same name each time. For example, a customer  could use William Rice or Bill Rice. Magento's reports on a customer's history are sorted by  the customer's name. If some of your customers have used several names, these reports will  not be completely accurate. When a customer uses a name and address that  s he has stored  online, the customer's name will be the same for every order. This enables you to get accurate  reports on customer activity, such as the following one under Reports  Customers:   Customers can subscribe to your newsletter, which gives you a chance to further build your  relationship with them.  [ 179 ]   Customer Relationships  You can organize your customers into Customer Groups. This enables you to assign different  price levels and tax rules to each Customer Group, as shown in the following screenshot:  Let's look at how Magento enables you to manage customer accounts and how you can   use them.  Time for action: Configuring customer account options Before using customer accounts, you should configure your customer settings. You do this  under System  Configuration  Customer Configuration:  [ 180 ]   There are five sections under Customer Configuration. Let's examine each of them.  1.   Online Customers Options  Chapter 8  Magento enables you to see which customers are online at any particular time. You  can see this by selecting Customers  Online Customers.  2.   3.   This report is refreshed every few minutes. The time interval is set under Online   Customers Options. Account Sharing Options The settings in this section are relevant only if you have created multiple stores on  the same site. This quick-start guide only covers creating a single store. As a basic  user, you can safely skip this section. Create New Account Options When your customers create accounts, the options that you set for them will affect  how they create those accounts and how you use them. These options are   as follows:     : This is the Customer Group to which every new   Default Group customer is assigned. For a simple site, you can leave this set to the  default of General. If you begin using different Customer Groups  to classify your customers  business, non-profit, wholesale, and  so on , you can assign them to the groups later. For now, you only  need to differentiate between shoppers who are not logged in and  customers who are logged in. Customers will belong to the group  General, and all others will belong to NOT LOGGED IN.  [ 181 ]   Customer Relationships     Default Email Domain : When a shopper or customer places   an order in your store,  s he must enter an email address to   fill out the order form. After the order is placed, Magento sends  a confirmation email to the address that the shopper enters.  Magento also enables you to create what is called an Admin Order.  This is an order that the site administrator  you  enters into the  system for the shopper. For example, if you take an order over the  phone instead of the shopper using your web site. In that case, you  will fill out an order form in the same way that an online shopper  would. That order form would also have a place for the shopper's  email address. When creating an Admin Order, the shopper might  not have an email address. Remember, you are creating an order  for someone who cannot or will not use your online form. On  an Admin Order, if you leave the shopper's email address blank,  Magento will create an email address for the shopper. That email  address will be customer_id@default_email_domain. For  example, if you create an Admin Order for customer ID number  2, and you enter a Default Email Domain of brew-me-a-cup.com,  Magento will send an order confirmation to the email address   2@ brew-me-a-cup.com. As you can see, the Default Email  Domain is relevant only if you create Admin Orders, and your  customers don't give you an email address to send order  confirmations. In that situation, you can use the Default Email  Domain to have Magento send you a confirmation at your domain  for your records. Default Welcome Email Magento sends the new customer a welcome email. This field  enables you to select the template for that email. You can create  new email templates and edit the default templates that come with  Magento. Editing these templates is beyond the scope of this book.  As a basic Magento user, you can safely leave this set to the default. Email Sender  new customers  will see in the "From" field of their welcome email. Require Emails Confirmation customers must confirm their accounts by clicking a link in the  welcome email. This is an extra step to creating a customer account.  You will inevitably lose some people at this step, as some people  will consider it too inconvenient. Consider the trade-off. This is extra  security for you, but extra inconvenience for your customer.  : Select the email address that the recipients    : When a user creates a customer account,   : If you select Yes for this field, new            [ 182 ]   Chapter 8     Confirmation Link Email  and Welcome Email: Use these fields   to select the email template for the account confirmation and  welcome emails. Modifying email templates is beyond the scope  of this quick-start guide. Leave these fields set to Default Template  from Locale.  4.   5.   Password Options These fields determine how a customer can retrieve his or her forgotten password.  Leave Forgot Email Template set to Default Template from Locale. For the field  Forgot Email Sender, select the email address that customers will see in the "From"  field when they receive their password reminder. Name and Address Options This section contains settings for the Name and Address sections of the new   customer form.  [ 183 ]   Customer Relationships  Most of the fields in the configuration screen are self-explanatory. The Prefix and  Suffix fields enable the customer to add a title before and after the name, as you   can see in the following form:  When you finish configuring the new customer function, click on the Save   Config button. Now you're ready for customers to begin registering and using   their accounts.  What just happened? You customer accounts are configured, and are ready to be used by your customers.

Then we examined the options that  you can set for your customers' accounts. You should encourage your customers to make  accounts on your site, and select the settings that make it as easy and quick as possible for  them to create those accounts.  [ 185 ]    9  Accepting Payment  Magento enables you to accept many different kinds of online payments.  This chapter will cover the Checkout and Sales configuration, and the various  payment types supported by Magento. A look at the System  Configuration   Payment Methods page will show a list of the online payment types that  Magento supports.  The page looks as follows:  Not shown in this screenshot is Google Checkout, another option for accepting payment. That  is on a separate page. There is also a separate page where you enter your PayPal accounts.   In this chapter, we will look at the details of setting up the different payment types.   Before we cover the topic of accepting payment, we need to perform some configuration.  This is the subject of the next section. Then, we will move on to configuring the payment  methods shown in the previous screenshot.   Accepting Payment  Checkout and Sales configuration  Various configuration options are scattered around the System  Configuration menu, which  must be set before you can accept payments. After you set these miscellaneous options, you  can proceed to configure Magento to accept credit cards, checks, money orders, and PayPal.  The Sales Tax page The System  Configuration  Tax page contains some configuration options, which you  should set before going online with your store. Not all of the options on this page need to be  set. We will cover the ones that you must review and or set.  In Chapter 4, we created Tax Classes for our Products. Under Tax Class for Shipping, you  should set the Tax Class for shipping charges. If you ship to locations that require you to  select a sales tax for shipping, then you will probably want to configure the Tax Class labeled  Shipping, which is built into Magento.  [ 188 ]   Chapter 9  The fields under the Calculation section determine when the sales tax is applied. For  example, in Chapter 7 we covered Tiered pricing, where you give a discount for buying  certain quantities. The field Apply Tax After Discount determines whether you apply sales  tax before or after this discount is applied.  Default Tax Origin Calculation should be set to your business location. If your business  is located in one taxing jurisdiction and your products are being shipped from a different  jurisdiction, consult a tax adviser about how this affects your tax liability.  Display determines how taxes are displayed in the Shopping Cart. By default, taxes are  displayed separately from prices. You can choose to display prices including tax.  Fixed Product Tax always adds the same amount of tax to a product, no matter what price  the product is. After enabling the fixed tax, you can add an Attribute to the Product to record  the fixed tax. This is useful for items where the jurisdiction charges a flat tax per item. For  example, many states charge a flat tax on each automobile tire, to help pay for the disposal  of used tires.  The Checkout page Logged-in users can use a feature called One Page Checkout, which you can enable or  disable. One Page Checkout is enabled by default.   The One Page Checkout feature puts all of the checkout items on a single page, in separate  tabs. The customer proceeds from tab to tab, but never leaves that page. A sidebar on the  right shows the customer's progress, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 189 ]   Accepting Payment  Time for action: Configuring Checkout options  1.  2.   3.  4.   5.  6.   7.  8.

This field determines whether   Go to  Ena someone who has not created an account on your site can complete a purchase.  If you set this to No, then buyers must create an account while completing their  purchases. You should weigh the benefits of making customers create accounts  against the chance of losing customers during the checkout, because they may not  want to create accounts. By default, this is set to Yes so that customers are not  required to create accounts to complete a purchase. Set the amount of time for which a shopper can keep an item in his her Shopping Cart. The customer's saved Shopping Cart before the price expires. If your prices change every  few days, you should set this such that a customer won't have the old price if  s he  returns to a saved Shopping Cart. Det Recall that a Grouped Product consists of a group of Simple Products. Also, recall  that when a Grouped Product is added to the Shopping Cart, each of the Simple  Products is added individually. The field Grouped product image determines if the  thumbnail image for those individual Products will be the one for the Group, or  different for each individual Product. Det Recall that a Configurable Product also consists of a group of Simple Products, each  one being slightly different. The Configurable product image field determines if the  thumbnail image for a Configurable Product will be the one for the Configurable  Product, or for the individual Simple Product that was chosen.  ermine if a Configurable Product has its own image in the Shopping Cart.  ermine if a Grouped Product has its own image in the Shopping Cart.  What just happened? In the previous procedure, you set some basic options for how your checkout process will  work. The most important was whether you will force shoppers to create an account to  check out, or allow guests to check out.  The Sales configuration page The Sales configuration page can be found at System  Configuration  Sales  Sales. The  configuration options affect the display of the Shopping Cart.

The section Checkout totals sort order is used to sort out the calculated items that   appear in the Shopping Cart. Their normal order is:                 Subtotal Discount Shipping Fixed Product Tax Grand Total  Notice that Tax is displayed after Discount. This makes sense if you're applying the  discount first. However, if you set Apply Tax After Discount to No, that means you're  applying the Tax first and then the Discount. In that case, you might want to use this  page to display the Tax before the Discount. Notice also that Tax is displayed after Shipping. If you know that you will never  charge tax on shipping, you could rearrange these and put Shipping after Tax. That  would make it clear to the customer that you are calculating Tax before Shipping.  Therefore, there is no tax on shipping. All customer can then just click on the saved copy to duplicate that order.  ow Reorder saves a copy of the past orders in a customer's account. The   4.

If you allow customers to select different currencies, or if you have a different  Base  currency and Default display currency, you should set up currency exchange rates  under Scheduled Import Settings. This will update the exchange rates daily, enabling  Magento to convert between currencies. If you want to use a currency that is not shown in this list, it is probably because that  currency is not installed. Go to Advanced  System and select the Currency section.  You will see a list of the Installed Currencies. If the currency you want to use is not  selected, then select it and save the configuration.  What just happened? Magento is ready to be configured for online payment methods.  You are now ready to configure your payment methods. Let's begin with an overview of  the online payment process for credit cards. Next, we will cover the details of each of the  payment methods.  An overview of the online payment process for   credit cards  To process credit cards online, the following four components need to work together:  1.  2.  3.  4.   Shopping Cart. Payment Gateway. Merchant Account. Bank Account.  Each of these components does a specific job in the order presented here. In the following  subsections, we will discuss each component.  [ 194 ]   Chapter 9  Shopping Cart Like most e-commerce systems, Magento uses a Shopping Cart to hold the customer's  items. In addition to the items that the customer is buying, the Shopping Cart also holds the  amount that the customer owes.  Magento's Shopping Cart is built-in; you don't need to use a separate piece of software to  create a Shopping Cart.  Payment Gateway When a customer proceeds to the checkout screen,  s he chooses the payment method. If a  customer chooses to pay by credit card,  s he must then enter the credit card details. When  the customer clicks on the Submit button and sends the credit card information, a piece of  software called the Payment Gateway takes over. The Payment Gateway is the equivalent of  the physical credit card terminal located in most retail outlets.  The Payment Gateway securely transmits the credit card information to the credit card  network, such Visa or MasterCard. The network validates the credit card information and  amount. That is, Visa, MasterCard, or some other network determines that the credit card  is valid and has the funds available. The network gives the transaction an authorization  number, which the Gateway returns to Magento. Thus, the payment is authorized.  You should keep in mind that the Payment Gateway is both a piece of software and a service.  The software communicates between your Shopping Cart and the credit card network. The  service performs the card validation. The software part of the Payment Gateway is built  into Magento; the service isn't. You will need to open an account with one of the Payment  Gateways that Magento supports.  Merchant Account and business Bank Account After the credit card payment is authorized, the money must be transferred from the credit  card account to your business's checking account. This is done by the Merchant Account.  A Merchant Account is more than just another bank account. It is an account, a contract with  the credit card network s  from which you will accept payment, and also a line of credit. All  of these features together form a Merchant Account.  The credit card network transfers money from the credit card account to the Merchant  Account. If you have a Merchant Account, it is the end of the process. You can then choose  to keep the money in your Merchant Account, or transfer it to another Bank Account.  [ 195 ]   Accepting Payment  Opening a Merchant Account can be expensive. It requires a credit check, and in some cases,  collateral. Also, there is a monthly maintenance fee that is higher than a normal bank account.  However, there is a way for you to accept credit card payments without a Merchant Account.  We will deal with that in the next section. The following image shows the complete process:  Shopping Cart  Payment Gateway  Merchant Account  Bank Account  Receives Payment from Credit Card Network Can be Expensive to Open Monthly Fee Transaction Fee  Your Business Bank Account Receives Money from the Merchant Account You Get Paid!  Merchandise Order Total Credit Card Details  Online Version of a Credit Card Terminal Communicates with Credit Card Network Validates Card and Amount Returns an Authorization Number A Piece of Software and a Service  1.  2.  3.  4.   Shopping Cart. Payment Gateway. Merchant Account. Bank Account.  Where do PayPal, Authorize.net, and Payflow fit in? The previous section explained the following four components of the credit card process:  In Magento, the Shopping Cart is a built-in feature, you only need to configure it, and the  Bank Account is yours. That means you still need a Payment Gateway and Merchant Account.  PayPal, Authorize.net, and Payflow can perform these functions.  Payflow Pro is a Payment Gateway Payflow Pro is a Payment Gateway. If you have your own Merchant Account, you can use  Payflow Pro to validate credit card payments.  To use Payflow Pro, you must open a Payflow Pro account. As of this writing, Payflow is  owned by PayPal. So, you would need to go to the PayPal web site, www.PayPal.com,   to open a Payflow account.  [ 196 ]   If you use Payflow Pro, the process looks as follows:  Chapter 9  Magento’s Shopping  Card  Payflow Pro  Gateway  Your  Merchant Account  Optional: Your Bank Account  Notice that a Bank Account is optional because you own the Merchant Account. Since the  funds are transferred from the credit card network into your Merchant Account, you now  have the money. It is your decision to keep it in your Merchant Account or transfer it to a  Bank Account.  PayPal and Authorize.net are Gateways plus Merchant Accounts If you do not have or do not want a Merchant Account, you can still use PayPal and  Authorize.net to process credit card transactions. When these companies process a credit  card transaction for you, they act as both the Payment Gateway and the Merchant Account.  This means that you don't need to open a separate Merchant Account. Instead, PayPal and  Authorize.net will:  1.  2.  3.   Validate the credit card transaction. Accept funds from the credit card network. Transfer those funds to your Bank Account.  If you use PayPal or Authorize.net, the process looks as follows:  Magento’s Shopping  Card  Your Bank Account  Paypal or  Authorize.net   their Gateway and  their Merchant  Account   Notice that a Bank Account is required. That is because PayPal or Authorize.net must transfer  the funds from their Merchant Account to your Bank Account.  Which option is the best for credit card processing? So far, we looked at three options for credit card processing: PayPal, Authorize.net, and  Payflow Pro. Now you need to decide which is the best for your business.  If your store has two hundred or more transactions a month, consider using Payflow Pro.   You will need to open and maintain your own Merchant Account, which is an added expense.  However, the fee for each transaction is usually smaller than PayPal and Authorize.net   because Payflow does less, as it's only a Gateway . Also, Payflow has better reporting tools.  [ 197 ]   Accepting Payment  If you have a physical store and are adding an online store, you probably already have a  Merchant Account. In that case, Payflow Pro will probably be your best option for processing  credit cards.  If you want to accept both credit cards and regular PayPal payments, then PayPal is the  obvious choice. Magento can be configured to accept both credit card and email-based  payments from PayPal.  If you have a low volume of sales, or don't have the fee, or a good enough credit rating to  open a Merchant Account, consider either PayPal or Authorize.net.  Payment methods in detail  The following sections describe each of the payment methods available in Magento. These  methods are available on the System  Configuration  Payment Methods page, and also on  Google Checkout. The payment methods in Magento can be seen in the following screenshot:  Remember that to use any of the PayPal methods, you must enrol in PayPal and enter your  PayPal account information under System  Configuration  PayPal Accounts.  [ 198 ]   The following subsections give you details about each of the payment methods available in  Magento. However, no step-by-step directions of how to set up each payment method are  given. This is for two reasons. First, the official Magento site contains thorough directions for  configuring each of these payment methods. Second, some of these configuration options  are likely to change while this book is in print.  Chapter 9  Instead of telling you how to configure each payment method, the following  sections focus on a more difficult task. They give you the information you need  to decide which payment methods are best for your store, and what effect each  method might have on your business.  Use this information to select the payment methods that are best for your business. Then,  head to the official Magento site for directions on how to configure them.  Saved CC When you enable this payment method, Magento will save the customer's credit card  information along with the order. Offline, you can verify the credit card payment.  If you have a physical store where you already accept credit cards, you could use this method.  You could use Magento to capture and save the credit card information, and process the  payment information later. This would require you to manually process each order.  If you already have a Merchant Account for your physical store, and you expect your online  sales volume to be low, then this is a quick and free way to accept credit card payments online.  To use this method, you need a Merchant Account and a credit card terminal.  Zero Subtotal Checkout If you enable this method, when a customer places an order and the product total is equal to  zero, the customer will not be asked to enter any payment information. You might use this if  you offer free samples from your store.  [ 199 ]   Accepting Payment  Check Money Order When you enable this payment method, and the customer selects it during checkout, the  customer is given your payment address and the Make Check payable to information, as  shown in the following screenshot:  To use this method, you only need a bank account where you can deposit checks and   money orders.  Purchase Order When you enable this payment method, and the customer selects it during checkout,  Magento prompts the customer to enter the purchase order number. This purchase order  number will appear on the order that is submitted to your store.  This is an offline payment method, like Check Money Order and Saved Credit Card. You must  manually check the purchase order number that the customer entered against your records.  This means that you are maintaining purchase order numbers in a system outside   of Magento.  To use this method, you need a system for tracking purchase orders and a bank account.  [ 200 ]   Chapter 9  Authorize.net If you enable this method, customers can enter their credit card information just as they do  on any e-commerce site. There is no indication that Authorize.net is processing the credit  card. The customer remains on your site while Authorize.net processes the credit card.  To use this method, you need to enrol in www.authorize.net, and should have a   bank account.  Payflow Pro If this method is enabled, customers can enter their credit card information just as they   do on any e-commerce site. There is no indication that Payflow is processing the credit card.  The customer remains on your site while Payflow processes the credit card.  To use this method, you need to enrol in Payflow Pro and should have a Merchant Account.  PayPal Express Checkout This is the traditional PayPal method, where no credit card is needed. Instead, money is  transferred from the buyer's PayPal account to the seller's PayPal account.  Your customer needs a PayPal account to use the PayPal Express   Checkout method.  If a customer is shipping an order to multiple addresses,  s he cannot select this   payment method.  When the customer selects this method,  s he will be redirected to the PayPal web site.  [ 201 ]   Accepting Payment  After selecting PayPal Express or PayPal Standard as the payment method, the customer  continues to the Order Review step, where  s he confirms the order.  After clicking on the Place Order button, the customer is taken to the PayPal site shown in  the following screenshot:  Then, the customer sees your store as the payee, and the amount to be paid. The customer  also chooses a shipping address.  [ 202 ]   Chapter 9  The customer then authorizes the payment. Money is transferred from the buyer's PayPal  account to your PayPal account.  After the payment is done, the buyer is taken back to your store. The merchandise is shipped  to the address that the buyer has on file at PayPal. The shipping address that the buyer  entered into Magento is ignored.  The completed order displays the shipping address that Magento received from PayPal. The  billing address section is empty.  PayPal Website Payments Standard The processing flow for PayPal Standard is almost identical to PayPal Express. That is, the  customer will be temporarily taken off your site and to the PayPal site to submit their payment.  The only differences are that the shipping address from Magento is used instead of the  shipping address from the customer's PayPal account, and PayPal Standard allows credit cards.  To use PayPal Express or Standard, you just need a PayPal account and a bank account.  PayPal Standard is probably the easiest way to accept credit card payments on your site. The  only disadvantage is that customers leave your site during the checkout process, which might  result in a greater number of abandoned transactions.  PayPal Website Payments Pro—Direct Payments If you enable this method, customers can enter their credit card information just as they do  on any e-commerce site. There is no indication that PayPal is processing the credit card. The  customer remains on your site while PayPal processes the credit card.  To use this method, you just need a PayPal account and a bank account. As of this writing,  if you select this method, PayPal requires that you also offer your customers PayPal Express  checkout. That is, if you have PayPal process your credit cards, you must also offer your  customers the option of using their PayPal account.  This is probably the most professional-looking option for processing credit cards, because  customers don't leave your site to submit payment. However, you might want to reassure  customers that their credit cards are safe by putting a notice on your payment page like, "Your  credit card is processed by PayPal, an established leader in e-commerce safety and security!"  [ 203 ]   Accepting Payment  PayPal Website Payments Pro  Payflow Edition —Express   and Direct With the previous four PayPal methods, PayPal is both our payment gateway and your  merchant account. That is, PayPal processes the credit card, and, accepts the money from  the credit card company and transfers it into your account. If you use the Payflow method,  then PayPal becomes only your payment gateway. That is, PayPal will only process the credit  card payments. They will not act as your merchant account. You will need to establish a  merchant account elsewhere, and link PayPal Payflow to that account. This might be a good  option for you if you have a physical store that accepts credit cards, and you are happy with  your merchant account. Payflow will enable you to accept credit cards online while using the  same merchant account that you have been using for your physical store.   Google Checkout Google Checkout is configured under System  Configuration  Sales  Google API. First, let's  look at the customer experience when you use this payment method. Then, let's discuss how  to decide if it's right for your store.  When you enable Google Checkout, Magento will display a Google Checkout button in the  customer's Shopping Cart as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 204 ]   When a customer clicks on the Google Checkout button,  s he is taken to Google's checkout  interface. This is completely separate from Magento's checkout process. At this point, the  customer must either log into his or her Google account, or create a Google account.  Chapter 9  [ 205 ]   Accepting Payment  After your customer logs into or creates his her Google account, Google Checkout displays  its own version of a Checkout Page as shown in the following screenshot:  Notice that customers can select the shipping method. The choices on this drop-down menu  are carried over from Magento. They are configured in the Google API tab.  Also notice that Google Checkout calculates the sales tax. The tax rules are also carried over  from Magento.  The credit card is entered in Google Checkout, not Magento.  You can see that the items in this Shopping Cart were also carried over from Magento.  Customers cannot change these items from this screen. To change the items, customers  must close this page, return to Magento, and start over.  When a customer clicks the Place your order now button, the order is placed. The customer  will be returned to Magento.  Unseen by the customer, Google keeps a record of the order in your Google Seller's Account.  Google also sends the order information to Magento. Magento will create the order under  Sales  Orders, where it will be stored with all of the orders that were processed in Magento.  Advantages and disadvantages of Google Checkout Knowing the advantages and disadvantages of Google Checkout will help you decide if you  want to offer it to your customers.  [ 206 ]   Chapter 9  As you can see from the previous subsection, when your customer uses Google Checkout,  s he  is taken from your site to the Google's Checkout site. If the customer doesn't have a Google  account,  s he must create one. This is an extra step for your customer. You might lose some  customers during checkout because of the time they must take to create Google accounts.  Another disadvantage of Google Checkout is that it is not as easy to set up in Magento as the  other payment methods. The official Magento site has step-by-step directions. However, it is  more complicated than the setup for other payment methods.  Google Checkout is available only to customers in the United States.  The last disadvantage to using Google Checkout is that the customer can choose to not give  you a telephone number, and can mask his or her email address. This makes it more difficult  for you to contact the customer if there's a problem with the order. While Google will  forward your email to the customer, you will not know for sure if your message reached the  customer and you cannot call the customer to check.  There are several advantages to using Google Checkout. One is that the Google brand might  reassure your shoppers that you are legitimate and that their transaction is secure.  Another advantage is that, as of this writing, the transaction fee for Google Checkout is  usually lower than that for PayPal or Authorize.net.  Finally, as of this writing, for every $10 that you process through Google Checkout you get a  $1 credit with Google Adwords.  Configuring a payment method Select a payment method and configure it in your store. The easiest payment method to  set up is Check Money Order. Once you have a payment method, you can go through the  complete checkout process as a customer.  You should go through the descriptions of the payment methods that we saw, and select   the one that best fits the needs of your customers and your business. Select the methods  that you want, and then go the official Magento site and search for directions on how to   configure them.  Summary  In this chapter, you performed some miscellaneous configuration needed to enable you to  accept payments. Then, we discussed the details of various payment methods. By now, you  should have a good idea of which payment methods are best for your business. We end   the chapter with an assignment: select and configure the payment methods that best meet   your needs.  [ 207 ]    10  Configure Shipping  This chapter covers the configuration of Magento's shipping options. The most  difficult part of configuring Magento's shipping options is not performing the  actual configuration, but deciding which options are the best for your store. You  need to understand how each of the shipping options in Magento affects your  finances and your customers' experience. After you decide which shipping options  are the best for your store, you need to configure them. Most of the configuration  options are self-explanatory.  This chapter will give you the information you need to decide which shipping options are  best for you. Next, it will cover the configuration settings that are less obvious, or whose  names might be misleading.  Decisions you must make  To help you decide which shipping methods are best for your business, consider the  questions discussed in the subsections that follow. Each of these questions equates   to a configuration option in Magento. When you know the answer to a question, you   can follow through by setting the corresponding configuration option.   Configure Shipping  Will you allow multiple addresses? You can allow customers to send the items in their orders to multiple addresses. If you  enable this, Magento displays a link in the Shopping Cart to Checkout with Multiple  Addresses as shown in the following screenshot:  This option is set under System  Configuration  Shipping Settings  Options. When a  customer chooses this, each item in the Shopping Cart can have its own shipping address.   If there are two items in the cart, Magento creates two shipping addresses. If there are   20 line items, Magento creates 20 addresses.  If your customer has too many items in the Shopping Cart, and selects Checkout with  Multiple Addresses, Magento can create so many shipping addresses that it will overwhelm  your server. To avoid this, use the Maximum qty allowed for Shipping to multiple addresses  setting to limit the number of addresses that can be created. This setting is also under  System  Configuration  Shipping Settings  Options.  What shipping methods will you offer? Magento enables you to offer your customers a choice of shippers: UPS, FedEx, DHL, and  United States Postal Service. Or, you can forgo offering your customers different shippers   and just offer them different shipping methods instead such as Flat Rate, or a Shipping Table.  [ 210 ]   Chapter 10  Flat Rate shipping The Flat Rate method means you add the same shipping charge to every order, no matter  how small or large the order is. Think of the Flat Rate as your handling fee. When an order  uses this shipping method, the customer does not choose the shipper.  If you use the Flat Rate shipping method, make sure that the sum of the Product's price and  the flat rate will cover your cost for packing and shipping the Product.  Table Rate method The Table Rate method calculates the shipping charge using a table that you create.   This table calculates the shipping charge based upon one of the following:           Destination and weight Destination and price Destination and the number of items in the order  For example, the following is the shipping rate table for our demo site, which we will create  later in this chapter. Notice that the shipping charge is based on destination and price. Also,  notice that we have entered a wildcard  *  for the destination, so these shipping charges  apply to all destinations. Effectively, we are basing the shipping charge on just the price.  [ 211 ]   Configure Shipping  During checkout, your customer will see the shipping charge under the Shipping Method  section. The subtotal for this order is $39.00, which according to the table in the previous  screenshot has a shipping charge of $5.00:  When you use the Table Rate method for shipping, you can also add a handling charge.   The handling charge will be added to the rate from the table, so that the customer won't   see the handling charge as a separate item.  UPS, USPS, FedEx, and DHL You can offer your customers one or more of the following shippers:  United Parcel Service  UPS       United States Postal Service  USPS    Federal Express  FedEx    DHL  For each shipper that you offer, you can designate which services you make available.   You do not need to offer all of the services that the shipper offers.  Offering multiple shipping methods You can offer your customers none, one, or several of the shippers we just saw.  [ 212 ]   Note that you do not need to offer your customers a choice of shippers. Using the Table  Rate method, you can just offer them a choice of shipping methods instead—such as "5-7  day," "2-day," and "Overnight"—and use the shipper that you think is best for that method.  In the following screenshot, we use the Table Rate method to offer the customers 5-7 Day  Shipping, and UPS for 2-day and Overnight shipping:  Chapter 10  Where can the buyer send the items to? There are two places in the Configuration page where you can designate the countries to  which you will ship. First, you set the default Allow Countries under System  Configuration   General as shown in the following screenshot:  To select multiple countries, hold down the Ctrl key while clicking on each country.  [ 213 ]   Configure Shipping  Second, you can designate which countries will work with each of the shipping methods  that you implement. The choices that you make for each shipping method will override the  default that you set under System  Configuration  General. In the following example, we  are offering Flat Rate shipping only to the United States. If the shipping address is outside   of the United States, this method will not be offered.  [ 214 ]   Chapter 10  Will you charge a handling fee? For each of the shipping methods except for Flat Rate, you can add a handling fee. Magento  adds this fee to the shipping rate that it gets from the Shipping Table or from the shipper.  Your customer will not see the handling fee as a separate charge.  The handling fee is configured separately for each shipping method. The following is an  example of adding a Handling fee to the rates for UPS:  [ 215 ]   Configure Shipping  Do you offer free shipping for a minimum dollar amount? Free Shipping is a separate shipping method. To enable this, go to System  Configuration   Shipping Methods  Free Shipping, enter a Minimum order amount, and select the  countries to which you will ship for free:  If the order doesn't meet the minimum amount, this shipping method will not be displayed.  Notice the field Show method if not applicable. This setting appears only if you previously  selected Specific countries in the Ship to applicable counties field. If you selected All  Allowed Countries, then this setting is hidden.  By default, this is set to No. If the order meets the minimum, but it's not available for the  shipping address, this shipping method doesn't display. However, selecting Yes for this field  displays the Free Shipping method if the order meets the minimum amount, but the country  doesn't qualify. In that case, the customer gets the Displayed Error Message.  [ 216 ]   Configuration settings and issues  Now that you have decided what kind of shipping you will offer and what you will charge for  shipping, you are ready to configure the shipping method. This section contains the overall  configuration settings, plus specific configuration issues for each of the shipping methods.  Chapter 10  Time for action: Setting the overall configuration settings that  affect shipping At a minimum, you should set the configuration options in this section before configuring  any specific shipping methods. Select countries to which you will ship  1.   Select   System  Configuration  General.  2.  For Default country, select the default country for shipping addresses. 3.   Under  multiple countries, hold down the Ctrl key while clicking on each country. Click  Allow countries, select all the countries to which you will ship.

Under the  When Magento contacts the shippers, it will use this information to calculate the  shipping charges. Under the  Options section, determine if you will allow customers to ship each   item to a different address, and enter the maximum number of items that you   will ship separately. Click on the   Save Config button.  What just happened? The general configuration options for shipping have been set. You are ready to configure  individual shipping methods.  [ 218 ]   Configuring Flat Rate shipping Like all other shipping methods except Free Shipping, the Flat Rate method enables you   to enter a handling fee. Go to System  Configuration  Shipping Settings  Flat Rate.   The handling fee can be a Fixed amount or a Percent of the order total, as shown in the   following screenshot:  Chapter 10  If you enter a fixed handling fee, it will be added to the price, and the shipping charge will   be the same every time this method is used. If you enter a percentage for the handling fee,   the system will calculate the handling fee based on the order total and add that to the   shipping price.  Configure the Table Rate As stated earlier, the Table Rate method calculates the shipping charge based upon one of  the following:           Destination and weight Destination and price Destination and number of items in the order  The table of rates is created in Excel  or some other spreadsheet program , saved as a text  file, and then uploaded to Magento.

System  Configuration, in the upper-left corner, change Current   Under  Configuration Scope back to Default Configuration.  Chapter 10  What just happened? When we configured the Flat Rate shipping method, we first selected the specific store to  which the rates will apply. Next, we exported a blank template for the shipping rates. We  opened the template in a spreadsheet program, added our rates, and saved it as a text file.  We then imported the completed rates. Finally, we set the configuration scope back to the  default. The result is that now Magento holds a table of shipping rates that we created.  Configuring Free Shipping The Free Shipping method will appear only if the shipping address is in one of the allowed  countries and the order total meets the minimum requirement. Even if the order qualifies  for free shipping, the customer must still click and select this shipping method. Remember  that the customer will see the Title that you enter, so make it something more descriptive  than just Free Shipping. In our demo store, we changed the Title to explain why we offer free  shipping by going to System  Configuration  Shipping Methods  Free Shipping. Look at  this screenshot:  [ 223 ]   Configure Shipping  UPS Unlike the other shippers, UPS enables you to choose a Weight Unit of pounds or kilograms.  All other shippers use the default unit for your store.  Also, unlike the other shippers, you do not need to register for an account with UPS to use  their gateway. This makes UPS the easiest shipper to set up.  USPS To use USPS, you must register for a USPS web tools user ID. At the time of this writing, the  URL to register is https:  secure.shippingapis.com Registration . Or, go to  http:  www.usps.com webtools  and select the link to Register now to begin using   the USPS Web Tools.  Your new account will work on their testing server. The gateway URL for the testing server  is different than the default that is programmed into Magento. Enter the URL for the testing  server, test it, and if it works follow the instructions in the email they sent to get your  account activated for the production server.  For some users, the test server never works. These users ask to be moved to production right  away and, usually, the gateway works for them.   Make sure that your product weight is in ounces and pounds, and that each product has a  weight of at least one ounce. Otherwise, the USPS gateway will fail to return any shipping  rates at all.  FedEx To use the FedEx gateway, you must have an Account ID. This is a "production key" that  FedEx will give you when you register.  To get a production key, you must register with the FedEx Developer Resource Center. On  the FedEx web site, perform a search to locate this page. Then, select the link to Obtain  Production Key and follow the instructions that are online.  When FedEx supplies you with the production key, enter it into the Account ID field in  System  Configuration  Shipping Methods  FedEx.  [ 224 ]   Chapter 10  DHL As with USPS and FedEx, DHL requires you to create an account before you can use its  gateway. While Magento does have a place to configure DHL, at this time, Magento is not  on DHL's list of supported software. This means that while the Magento community will  help you troubleshoot DHL configuration, DHL will not help you. You can see the list of  Shopping Carts that DHL supports at http:  www.dhl-usa.com xml vendormodule. asp?nav=TechnologyTools.  Time for action: Configuring and testing the shipping rates Even if you're not sure which shipping options you want to use in your store, at this point   you should configure at least one of them. This will enable you to test the full functionality   of your Shopping Cart, and place test orders.  1.   2.   Configure at least one shipping option and step through the checkout process with  that option enabled. This will allow you to see the complete checkout process. The  easiest to configure is flat rate shipping. Also, consider which shipper s  you want to offer, and sign up for accounts with  those shippers. When you have your accounts, you can configure Magento to  connect to those shippers.  What just happened? We configured the shipping options for our store. We are now ready to place test orders,  which will be covered in the next chapter.  Pop quiz  1.   2.   3.   When you offer a shipper, you must offer all of that shipper's services to your  customers. True False When you offer a shipper, you must offer all of the countries to which that company  ships.

Which shipper does not require you to register an account, to use its gateway    Configure Shipping   select one ?  a.  b.  c.  d.   UPS USPS FedEx DHL  Summary  Magento offers relatively easy ways of configuring shipping options for your customers. All  of the methods covered in this chapter have one thing in common: They add a shipping  handling charge to the customer's order, but do not interface directly with a scale, a label  printer, or a postage printer. That is, after these methods calculate shipping handling and  add that amount to the order, their job is done. You must still perform these functions in a  system outside of Magento.  When you offer your customers a choice of shipping methods, try to use labels that tell your  customers what they can expect from a method before selecting it. For example, if you're  using FedEx only for overnight shipping, instead of labelling it as "FedEx," label the method  "Overnight with FedEx".  Beware of times when the shipping charge that you calculate might not cover your cost  of shipping an object. For example, if you're calculating shipping based on weight and  destination, and you sell an object that is very light but very bulky  like a paper chandelier ,  the standard shipping cost for that item's weight might not cover your cost. So, keep unusual  shipping costs in mind when pricing your products.  [ 226 ]   11  Fulfilling an Order  In Magento, fulfilling an order usually follows a logical order of steps. Magento has  features that you can use at each step of an order's lifecycle. While these features are  not perfect, they are impressive and easy to use.  In this chapter we will see the lifecycle of an order, and certain tips for managing orders.  Next, we will practice the processing of an order.  The lifecycle of an order  This section will walk you through the process of fulfilling an order. At each step of the  process, we will discuss the features that Magento offers for that step.  Step 1: Customer places the order After a customer places an order on your site, both you and the customer will see the status  of the order as either Pending or Processing. Your customer will see this after clicking on the  My Account link.   Fulfilling an Order  Notice the Status of the order.  In the admin interface, you will see this under Sales  Orders as shown in the next screenshot:  Notice the Status column, second from the right.  If the customer has chosen to pay by check, or money order, and payment for the order has  not arrived, the status will be Pending. If the customer has chosen to pay using PayPal and  the payment has not arrived, the status will be Pending Paypal. If the customer has chosen  the credit card option and the payment has cleared, the status will be Processing. So, in  general we can say the following:        Pending Processing  : The order is placed and you're waiting for payment.  : The order is placed and you have been paid.  [ 228 ]   At this point, click on the View link to open the order. The Order View window gives you a  snapshot of the order's history and the current status, as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 11  [ 229 ]   Fulfilling an Order  Notice that status of the order is displayed in the lower left corner of the page. If you click on  the Status drop-down list, you will discover that you cannot change the status of the order:  Also, notice the buttons in the upper right corner of the page: Edit, Cancel, Hold, Invoice,  Ship, and Reorder. Each of these buttons is an action that you can perform on the order.   The status of the order changes as your perform these actions. This is an important concept  in Magento's order processing.  You do not assign a status to an order. The order's status changes automatically  as you process the order.  Step 2: You create an invoice At this point, you could Edit, Cancel, or place the order on Hold. But usually, you will proceed  to the Invoice step. We will look at Edit Cancel Hold later. For now, let's continue with the  most common process, and create an invoice.  When your customer placed the order,  s he received a confirmation email from Magento.  This email informed the customer that the order was placed. Now, you will create an invoice  for the customer. Even if the invoice is never sent to the customer, you should still create it.  We will discuss the reason behind this later on.  [ 230 ]   To create an invoice, click on the Invoice button. The New Invoice page is displayed as follows:  Chapter 11  [ 231 ]   Fulfilling an Order  Notice that the New Invoice page enables you to do several things as you create the invoice.  First, you can email a copy of the invoice to the customer by selecting the checkbox in the  lower right corner. This is not required, and it depends upon your business process. As stated  before, even if you do not email your customer a copy, you should still generate the invoice.  Second, you can enter comments into the Invoice Comments field in the lower left corner.  For example, if you've received the check, or money order, you can enter something like  "Received check 1000". If the credit card payment has already cleared, you can enter  something like "Payment cleared: Authorization number 11111111".  Third, notice that you can change the quantities to invoice. If we can change quantities, we  can divide the order in two parts  for example , and make an invoice for each part. This could  help if we do not have sufficient stock and would like to send what we have, and send the  rest when we receive it.   Clicking on the Submit Invoice button creates the invoice. You will be returned to the   Order View page, where you should see a confirmation message that the invoice was created.  Clicking on the Invoices tab displays the list of invoices for this order. You should see the  invoice you just created in that list as shown in the next screenshot:  [ 232 ]   Chapter 11  Notice that Magento has given the invoice a status of Paid. This is automatic; you cannot  do anything about this. As of this writing  Magento version 1.2 , when you create an invoice  for an order, that invoice's status will be Paid. However, the status of the order will be  Processing. Because of this, you might want to create invoices only after you have received  the payment. That way, the invoice's Paid status will match your real-world situation. You  should put a note in the Comments field for your customer that the invoice is paid so that    s he doesn't think you are sending them a bill.  Step 3: Locate the orders that need to be shipped Usually, you ship the order after you have received payment. Ideally, you want to be   able to quickly locate the orders for which people have paid, so that you can ship their  products promptly.  If a customer has paid by credit card or PayPal, and the payment has cleared, the order   is quick and easy. In the Sales  Orders page, you will see the order status as Processing.  Any order with a status of Processing has been paid for, but not yet shipped. Look for these  orders, and you will be able to quickly locate the orders that you need to ship.  [ 233 ]   Fulfilling an Order  You can locate the orders with this status by using the Status filter to show only the orders  with status Processing.  Locating orders that have been paid for by check, or money order, is not as easy. Remember  that when a customer places an order and selects Check or Money Order as the payment  method, the order's status is Pending. Look at the following screenshot:  After you generate an invoice, the order's status changes to Processing. If you wait   to generate the invoice until after receiving payment, then you can just look for all   the Processing orders and ship them.  [ 234 ]   However, suppose you send the customer an invoice as soon as you receive their order. This  would be a normal business process, which will be as follows:  Chapter 11              The customer places an order The merchant emails the customer with an invoice The customer prints the invoice and mails a check or money order The merchant ships the order  The challenge to this workflow is that as soon as you send the customer an invoice, the  order's status is advanced to Processing. Now you have two kinds of orders whose status   is Processing: orders for which you have received credit card payment and are ready to ship,  and orders for which you are awaiting check money order payment and are not ready to  ship. When you view your list of orders, how can you tell which are paid and ready to ship,  and which are not? Using Magento's built-in workflow  as of vesion 1.2 , there is no easy   way to locate orders that have been invoiced for a check or money order. So, let's look at   a workaround.  At any time before an order is completed, you can put an order on hold by clicking on the  Hold button in upper right corner of the page as shown in the following screenshot:     When you receive an order payable by check, or money order, you can use the   following workflow:  1.   2.  3.   Create and email an invoice to the customer. In the  instruct the customer to print this invoice and mail it along with the payment. The  order's status is advanced to Processing. Immediately, before leaving the invoice page, put the order  When the check or money order arrives  or when it clears—whichever you prefer ,  take the order off hold. The order's status is back to Processing.  Notes field of the invoice,   On Hold.  [ 235 ]   Fulfilling an Order  4.   Now, when you look at the list of orders on the  spot orders with the Status of Processing, and know that these are the orders you  must ship. Look at the following screenshot:  Sales  Orders page, you can quickly   Admittedly, this is not the intent of the Hold feature. Normally, a store would put an order  On Hold for other reasons, such as when an item is on backorder or the customer's payment  did not process correctly. However, until Magento adds a way for you to quickly locate orders  that you have invoiced but not received payment for, this might give you a workaround.  After identifying the orders that need to be shipped, you are ready to create the shipments.  Step 4: Print orders and pack them All of this activity needs to result in the actual physical delivery of a product. You must pack  and ship these products. If your computer is in the same room as your packing supplies, you  can display the paid orders on screen and pack them. If not, you might want to print packing  slips and bring them to your warehouse.  For orders that have a status of Processing, you can print a packing slip. On the Sales   Orders page, click to place a check mark next to the order. Then, from the Actions drop- down menu, select Print Packing slip and click on the Submit button.  Armed with a stack of packing slips and order printouts, you are ready to physically pack   your orders. As  or after  you pack them, create shipment notices in Magento. That is our  next step.  [ 236 ]   Step 5: Create a shipment After locating an order that has been paid for, and packing it, you should open the order in  Magento. You will see the familiar Order View page. At this page, click on the Ship button, as  shown in this screenshot:  Chapter 11  If the order was on hold, you will need to take it off hold before you can click on the Ship  button.  Clicking on the Ship button creates a new shipment.  [ 237 ]   Fulfilling an Order  You can add tracking information for this shipment by clicking on the Add Tracking   Number button.  If you choose to send the customer an email from this shipping page, the shipping  information that you enter here will be included in that email.  Notice that you can also update the quantities in the shipment under Qty to Ship.   This enables you to send the items in multiple shipments. You might do this if an item   is on a backorder.  To create additional shipments, you would go back to the Order View page and  click on the Ship button again, generating another new shipment.  You can enter comments about this shipment in the Shipment Comments box, in the lower  left corner of the page. These comments are visible only to you, unless you select the  Append Comments checkbox on the lower righthand side of the page. That checkbox will  add the comments to the email that is sent to the customer.  When you finish editing the information on this page, click on the Submit Shipment button.  This records the shipment and changes the order's status to Completed, as shown in the  following screenshot:  [ 238 ]   Chapter 11  Tips for managing orders  While following an order through the system, you saw some of Magento's advantages  and limitations. Because Magento is a very active open source project, its limitations are  constantly being replaced by new features.  We want to work within Magento's limitations while taking advantage of its features.  Customizing, or hacking, the code is beyond the scope of this book. With that in mind, here  are some suggestions for managing orders.  Ship orders paid for with checks money orders as you process the check As we saw in the workflow, when an order has been placed and you are awaiting the payment  by check, its status will be Pending. When you receive the check, you can then generate an  invoice. However, the order's status will not change; it remains Pending. In that case, both  paid and unpaid orders have the status of Pending. There is no easy way to locate the orders  that have been paid for. For orders that are placed using credit cards and PayPal, this is not a  problem. When you receive payment, their order status automatically updates to Processing.  Hopefully, Magento will add the ability to manually change the status of an order to  Processing or Paid. Until then, I suggest that you ship orders paid for with checks money  orders as you process them. For each order you should package the order, generate the  invoice, and generate the shipment notification—all in one session. The order's status will go  straight from Pending to Complete. This ensures that none of the paid orders get mistaken  for unpaid, which could cause you to neglect shipping them.  Be proactive and look for orders that have the status Pending or Pending Paypal   for too long The Sales  Orders page enables you to filter the list of orders so that you can show only  those with a selected status. It also enables you to sort the list on any of the columns.  Periodically, search for orders whose status is Pending or Pending Paypal. These orders are  unpaid. Then, sort the list by purchase date. If you have orders that have remained unpaid  for a long time, you might want to investigate. Did the PayPal payment fail to process? Check  your PayPal account. Did you receive a check or money order but you neglected to process  it and ship it? Being proactive like this can help you to solve payment glitches before they  become problems.  [ 239 ]   Fulfilling an Order Include a "You're paid up" comment on invoices that you email to your customers When Magento generates an invoice, it changes the status of that invoice to Paid. You can  see this status in the list of invoices under Sales  Invoices.  However, when you print the invoice for your customer, it does not explicitly indicate that it  has been paid.  [ 240 ]   Chapter 11  As you saw under the section on generating invoices, you can include a comment in an  invoice. If you have received a payment from the customer, add a comment about this to  the invoice before sending it to the customer. This will reassure the customer that his or her  payment has been received and the order is being processed.  [ 241 ]   Fulfilling an Order  Practicing the complete order process  In the previous chapters we created a customer account on our site, configured at least  one payment method  probably check money order , and configured at least one shipping  method  probably flat rate shipping . Now, let's put them all together into one process.  Time for action: Practice processing an order  1.   2.   3.  4.   5.   6.  7.   8.   Log in to your store as a fictional customer. Make sure the customer has a valid  email address. Place an order. Go through the entire checkout process. If you have configured  several payment methods, check out each one. Now, log in to the admin interface. Under  Sales  Orders, look for the order s  that you just placed. If you placed an  order using the check money order payment method, it should have the status  of Pending. If you placed an order with a credit card, it should have the status  Processing. If you used PayPal, the order should have the status of Pending Paypal  or Processing. For each order, generate an invoice and have Magento email it to the customer. For  the check money order, check whether it advanced to Processing. Check whether the customer's email for the invoice s  is correct. Create shipping notices for each order. Print a packing slip for each order. Check  whether their status advanced to Complete. Play with as many different scenarios as you can. Test your system and look at the  results from both the customer's and admin's view.

We will skip that tab because it is beyond the   The  scope of this beginner's guide. Instead, proceed to the Inventory tab.  Part 6: Inventory tab Notice that all of the settings on the Inventory tab, except for Qty and Stock Availability,   use the global configuration.  You will find these global inventory settings under System  Configuration    Catalog  Inventory.  35.   36.   If this is the first Product that you have added, at this point you might want to  navigate to System  Configuration  Catalog  Inventory and set these global  default values. If you open the System Configuration page in a new tab, you can  keep the Product Inventory tab open while you do this. Let's examine each of the fields. Remember that except for  Qty and Stock  Availability, each of these fields is found on both the Product and System  Configuration pages. Choose the one you want to edit and navigate to that page.  Then, select a setting for each of the following fields:  Field  Explanation  Appears  in System   Configuration   Catalog   Inventory  Appears  in Catalog   Manage  Products   Product   Inventory   Manage Stock  Qty  Set Items' Status  to be In Stock  When Order is  Cancelled Decrease Stock  When Order is  Placed Backorders              If this is set to Yes, then by default Magento  will keep a track of the inventory for a Product.  If it's set to No, Magento will not keep a track  of the inventory and all of the other settings  that are irrelevant for the Product. The  individual setting for the Product overrides the  setting for the System. This is the quantity that you have in stock.  This will "return" items to stock when an order  with that item is cancelled. Otherwise, you  must manually return the item to stock by  adding it to the quantity field. This global setting makes Magento  automatically deduct items from the quantity  when those items are ordered. This setting determines if you allow customers  to backorder an item that is out of stock.  [ 257 ]   Abbreviated Step-by-Step Directions  Field  Explanation  Appears  in System   Configuration   Catalog   Inventory  Appears  in Catalog   Manage  Products   Product   Inventory           Maximum Qty  Allowed in  Shopping Cart Qty for Items'  Status to become  Out of Stock  Minimum Qty  Allowed in  Shopping Cart Notify for  Quantity Below        Qty Uses Decimals   Stock Availability   The maximum quantity allowed in one order.  If the number in stock falls below this  threshold, this shows as Out of Stock. If you  run both an online and physical store, you  might want to keep a few items on the shelf.  So, you would set this to some number above  zero. The minimum quantity allowed in one order.  When the quantity in stock drops below  this number, Magento emails the store  administrator. This enables shoppers to order a quantity that  is something other than a whole number. For  example, 1.5 pounds of coffee. Magento automatically sets this to In Stock  or Out of Stock based upon the quantity in  stock, and the minimum quantity for the  item's status to be In Stock. However, you can  override this by changing the field yourself.  For example, suppose you are out of stock  and want to sell a floor model. The floor  model is not part of your stock. Therefore, you  don't want to add it to your quantity in stock.  But because your quantity in stock is zero,  Magento won't let you take orders for this  Product. You could set Stock Availability to Yes,  and that would enable you to take an order for  the Product.  [ 258 ]   Part 7: Categories  37.  Under the Categories tab, select the Categories in which this Product will reside.   Notice that you can select more than one Category. Finally, save the product.  38.   Appendix A.

Also, you should follow the directions under the section titled Setting the overall  configuration settings that affect shipping, in Chapter 10.  The official Magento site contains add-ons that enable you to offer additional   shipping methods.

Magento is the world's most evolved e-commerce solution. It runs on the Apache/MySQL/PHP platform. From one installation, you can control multiple storefronts, all sharing customer and product information. Magento's templates and themes enable you to customize the look and feel of your store, even optimizing it for mobile phones. Extensions enable you to connect Magento to a large number of payment gateways and shipping services. Modular code enables you to upgrade your Magento installation while retaining your customizations. Support is provided free by an active open source community and by subscription to Varien, the company behind Magento. Magento is one of the most exciting, flexible, and customizable e-commerce systems. It offers you an extensive suite of powerful tools for creating and managing an online store. As your online store grows, you can be sure that this robust e-commerce system can handle your needs. However, getting started with Magento can be difficult without the right guidance. This book provides that guidance in the form of a step-by-step approach to building a simple, effective online store. The book covers the key features of Magento that will help you get your store up and running. It guides you through installation, configuration, populating your store with products, accepting payments, maintaining relationships with your customers, and fulfilling orders. When you create an online store with Magento, you usually follow a defined series of steps. This book is arranged to support that process. Each chapter shows you how to get the most from one step. You will learn to customize the default Magento storefront so that it becomes your store and also about Magento's directory structure and where some of the elements of a store are customized. This experience will help you if you decide to go beyond this book and install new themes or create your own themes. As you work your way through each chapter, your store will grow in scope and sophistication. By the time you finish this book, you should have a basic but complete, working online store
