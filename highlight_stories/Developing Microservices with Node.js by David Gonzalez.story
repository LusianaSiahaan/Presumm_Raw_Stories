In the chapters, we will  discuss how to design, build, test, and deploy microservices using the best practices.  We will also discuss a valuable lesson: how to make the right level of compromise  in order to avoid over-designing and get the business requirements aligned with the  technical solutions.  What this book covers Chapter 1, Microservices Architecture, discusses the pros and cons of microservices- oriented architectures. It will be the foundation for the rest of the book. Chapter 2, Microservices in Node.js – Seneca and PM2 Alternatives, introduces Node.js,  Seneca, and PM2. In it, we will discuss the structure of a Node.js application and how  to run it using PM2. We will also dive into a few alternatives to Seneca and PM2. Chapter 3, From the Monolith to Microservices, covers how to tackle the organic growth   unplanned software changes  using microservices. We will also talk about how to  split a monolithic application into microservices. Chapter 4, Writing Your First Microservice in Node.js, explains how to write our   first microservice. Chapter 5, Security and Traceability, covers how security and traceability are two  important characteristics of modern systems. We need to keep the information secure  and the actions traceable. In this chapter, we will discuss how to do it using Seneca.  [ vii ]   Chapter 6, Testing and Documenting Node.js Microservices, introduces using the main  frameworks for testing on Node.js: Mocha and Chai. We will also make use of Sinon   another framework  to mock services. Swagger will be our choice for documenting  microservices. Chapter 7, Monitoring Microservices, covers using PM2 to monitor our microservices.  We will use it along with Keymetrics to get the maximum benefit of such an   advanced tool. Chapter 8, Deploying Microservices, explains how, using PM2, we are going to learn  to deploy microservices in our different environments, managing our ecosystem of  applications with a single command and reducing the overhead introduced by the  microservices architecture. We will also discuss Docker, one of the most advanced  systems to deploy applications not only in Node.js, but also in general applications.  What you need for this book In order to follow the book, we are going to need to install Node.js, PM2  it is a  package that is installed through npm , and MongoDB.  We will also need an editor. Personally, I use Atom, but any general purpose editor  should be enough.  Who this book is for This book is for developers that have some experience with Node.js but want to learn  about Seneca and microservices. It is 70% practice-oriented  as we will be writing  a lot of code , but it also is 30% theory, based on the code created that will help the  reader to apply the exposed patterns to new software.  Conventions In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different  kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of  their meaning.  Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions,  pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows:  "We know that the input parameter is a PaymentRequest instance."  [ viii ]   A block of code is set as follows:  public interface PaymentService {   PaymentResponse processPayment PaymentRequest request  throws       MyBusinessException; }  When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the  relevant lines or items are set in bold:  function   {   sinon.stub Math, "random" ;   rollDice  ;   console.log Math.random.calledWith   ; } ; after function  {   Math.random.restore  ; } ;  Any command-line input or output is written as follows:  node index.js  npm start  New terms and important words are shown in bold. Words that you see on the  screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "In this  case, I have used Chrome and the console shows an Uncaught TypeError: Cannot  set property 'innerText' of null error in line 7."  Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.  Tips and tricks appear like this.  Reader feedback Feedback from our readers is always welcome.

[ xi ]    Microservices Architecture  Microservices are becoming more and more popular. Nowadays, pretty much   every engineer on a green field project should be considering using microservices  in order to improve the quality of the systems they build. They should know the  architectural principles involving such systems. We will expose the difference  between microservices and Service-Oriented Architecture  SOA . We will also  introduce a great platform to write microservices, Node.js, which will allow us to  create high-performing microservices with very little effort.  In this chapter, you will learn about microservices from the architectural point   of view:     What are microservices?    Microservice-oriented architectures    Key benefits    SOA versus Microservices    Why Node.js?  Need for microservices The world of software development has evolved quickly in the past 40 years. One of  the key points of this evolution has been the size of these systems. From the days of  MS-DOS, we have taken a hundred-fold leap into our present systems. This growth  in size creates a need for better ways of organizing code and software components.  Usually, when a company grows due to business needs, known as organic growth,  the software is organized on a monolithic architecture as it is the easiest and quickest  way of building software. After few years  or even months , adding new features  becomes harder due to the coupled nature of the created software.  [ 1 ]   Monolithic software The natural trend for new high-tech companies such as Amazon or Netflix is building  their new software using microservices, which is the ideal scenario: they get a huge  advantage of microservices-oriented software  through out this book, you will learn  how  in order to scale up their new products without a big effort. The problem is  that not all companies can plan their software upfront. Instead of planning, these  companies build software based on the organic growth experienced: few software  components group business flows by affinity. It is not rare to see companies with two  big software components: the user-facing website and the internal administration  tools. This is usually known as a monolithic software architecture. Some of these companies face big problems when trying to scale the engineering  teams. It is hard to coordinate teams that build, deploy, and maintain a single  software component. Clashes on releases and reintroduction of bugs are a common  problem that drains a large chunk of energy from the teams. One of the solution  to this problem  it comes with benefits  is to split the monolithic software into  microservices so that the teams are able to specialize in a few smaller modules and  autonomous and isolated software components that can be versioned, updated, and  deployed without interfering with the rest of the systems of the company.  Splitting the monolith into microservices enables the engineering team to create  isolated and autonomous units of work that are highly specialized in a given task  such as sending e-mails, processing card payments, and so on.  Microservices in the real world Microservices are small software components that are specialized in one task and  work together to achieve a higher-level task. Forget about software for a second and  think about how a company works. When someone applies for a job in a company,  he applies for a given position: software engineer, system administrator, office  manager. The reason for this can be summarized in one word: specialization. If you  are used to work as a software engineer, you will get better with the experience and  add more value to the company. The fact that you don't know how to deal with a  customer, won't affect your performance as that is not your area of expertise and will  hardly add any value to your day-to-day work.  Specialization is often the key to improve the efficiency.  Doing one thing and doing it right is one of the  mantras of software development.  [ 2 ]   A microservice is an autonomous unit of work that can execute one task without  interfering with other parts of the system, similar to what a job position is to a  company. This has a number of benefits that can be used in favor of the engineering  team in order to help scale the systems of a company.  Nowadays, hundreds of systems are built using microservices-oriented architectures,  as follows:     Netflix: This is one of the most popular streaming services, it has built an   entire ecosystem of applications that collaborate in order to provide a reliable  and scalable streaming system used across the globe.     Spotify: This is one of the leading music streaming services in the world,  it has built this application using microservices. Every single widget of the  application  which is a website exposed as a desktop app using Chromium  Embedded Framework  is a different microservice that can be updated  individually.  Microservice-oriented architectures Microservices-oriented architectures have some particularities that makes them  desirable for any mid large-sized company that wants to keep their IT systems  resilient and in scale up down-ready status.  How is it better? They are not the holy grail of software engineering, but, when handled with care,  they become the perfect approach to solve most of the big problems faced by   tech-dependent companies.  It is important to keep the key principles of the microservices-oriented architecture's  design in mind, such as resilience, composability, elasticity, and so on; otherwise,  you could end up with a monolithic application split across different machines that  produces problems rather than an elegant solution.  Shortcomings There is also some criticism around microservices-oriented architectures, as  they introduce some problems to deal with, such as latency, traceability, and  configuration management that are not present with monolithic-based software.  Some of the problems are described as follows:     Network latency: Microservices have a distributed nature so that network   latency has to be accounted for  [ 3 ]      Operations overhead: More servers indicate more maintenance    Eventual consistency: On highly transactional systems, we need to factor  into implementation the fact that the data could be inconsistent during a  period of time  we will talk about it later in this chapter   In general, engineers should try to evaluate the pros and cons of this approach   and make a decision on whether to use microservices or not in order to fit the  business needs.  Microservices-oriented architectures have some particularities that need to be taken  into consideration. When a software engineer is writing monolithic software, there  are some problems that are completely overlooked due to the nature of the software  being built.  For example, imagine that our software needs to send e-mails. In a monolithic  software, we would just add the functionality to the core of the application. We  might even choose to create a dedicated module to deal with e-mails  which seems  like a good idea . Now, imagine that we are creating a microservice and, instead of  adding a functionality to a big software artifact, we create a dedicated service that  can be deployed and versioned independently. In this case, we will have an extra  step that we didn't have to take into consideration, the network latency, to reach the  new microservice.  In the preceding example, no matter what approach  monolithic or microservices   you are taking to build the software, is not a big deal; for example, if an e-mail is lost,  it is not the end of the world. As per definition, the e-mail delivery is not guaranteed,  so our application will still work, although we might receive a few complaints from  our customers.  Key design principles There are a few key design principles that need to be taken into consideration when  building microservices. There is no golden rule and, as microservices are a recent  concept, sometimes there is even a lack of consensus on what practices to follow.   In general, we can assume the following design principles:     Microservices are business units that model the company processes.    They are smart endpoints that contain the business logic and communicate   using simple channels and protocols.     Microservices-oriented architectures are decentralized by definition. This   helps to build robust and resilient software.  [ 4 ]   Business units, no components One of the most enjoyable sides of software engineering is creating a new project.  This is where you can apply all your creativity, try new architectural concepts,  frameworks, or methodologies. Unfortunately, it is not a common situation in a  mature company. Usually, what we do is create new components inside the existing  software. One of the best design principles that you can follow when creating new  components is keeping the coupling as low as possible with the rest of the software,  so that it works as an independent unit.  Keeping a low level of coupling allows a software component  to be converted into a microservice with little to no effort.  Consider a real-world example: the application of your company now needs to be  able to process payments.  The logical decision here would be creating a new module that knows how to deal  with the chosen payment provider  credit cards, PayPal, and so on  and allows us to  keep all the payment-related business logic inside of it. Let's define the interface in  the following code:  public interface PaymentService {   PaymentResponse processPayment PaymentRequest request  throws       MyBusinessException; }  This simple interface can be understood by everyone, but it is the key when moving  towards microservices. We have encapsulated all the business knowledge behind  an interface so that we could theoretically switch the payment provider without  affecting the rest of the application—the implementation details are hidden from the  outer world.  The following is what we know until now:     We know the method name, therefore, we know how to invoke the service    The method could throw an exception of the MyBusinessException type,   forcing the calling code to deal with it     We know that the input parameter is a PaymentRequest instance    The response is a known object  [ 5 ]   We have created a highly cohesive and loosely coupled business unit. Let's justify  this affirmation in the following:     Highly cohesive: All the code inside the payments module will do only one  thing, that is, deal with payments and all the aspects of calling a third-party  service  connection handling, response codes, and so on , such as a debit   card processor.     Loosely coupled: What happens if, for some reason, we need to switch   to a new payment processor? Is there any information bleeding out of the  interface? Would we need to change the calling code due to changes in the  contract? The answer is no. The implementation of the payment service  interface will always be a modular unit of work.  The following diagram shows how a system composed of many components gets  one of them  payment service  stripped out into a microservice:  [ 6 ]   Once this module is implemented, we will be able to process the payments and  our monolithic application will have another functionality that could be a good  candidate to extract into a microservice.  Now, we can rollout new versions of the payment service, as long as the interface  does not change, as well as the contract with the rest of the world  our system  or third parties , hasn't changed. That is why it is so important to keep the  implementation independent from interfacing, even though the language does not  provide support for interfaces.  We can also scale up and deploy as many payment services as we require so that  we can satisfy the business needs without unnecessarily scaling the rest of the  application that might not be under pressure.

Imagine a protocol that was designed to be state-less, but  was hacked through the use of cookies in order to hold the status of the client. This  was during the age of Web 1.0, when no one was talking about REST APIs or mobile  apps. Let's see an example of an HTTP request:  As you can see, it is a human readable protocol that does not need to be explained in  order to be understood.  Nowadays, it is broadly understood that HTTP is not confined to be used in the Web,  and as it was designed, it is now used as a general purpose protocol to transfer data  from one endpoint to another. HTTP is all you need for the communication between  microservices: a protocol to transfer data and recover from transmission errors   when possible .  In the past few years, especially within the enterprise world, there has been an effort  to create smart communication mechanisms such as BPEL. BPEL stands for Business  Process Execution Language, and instead of focusing on communication actions, it  focuses on actions around business steps.  This introduces some level of complexity in the communication protocol and makes  the business logic of the application bleed into it from the endpoints, causing some  level of coupling between the endpoints.  [ 8 ]   The business logic should stay within the endpoints and not bleed into the  communication channel so that the system can be easily tested and scaled. The  lesson learned through the years is that the communication layer must be a plain  and simple protocol that ensures the transmission of the data and the endpoints   microservices .These endpoints should embed into their implementation the fact  that a service could be down for a period of time  this is called resilience, we will talk  about this later in this chapter  or the network could cause communication issues.  HTTP usually is the most used protocol when building microservices-oriented  software but another interesting option that needs to be explored is the use of queues,  such as Rabbit MQ and Kafka, to facilitate the communication between endpoints.  The queueing technology provides a clean approach to manage the communication  in a buffered way, encapsulating the complexities of acknowledging messages on  highly transactional systems.  Decentralization One of the major cons of monolithic applications is the centralization of everything  on a single  or few  software components and databases. This, more often than not,  leads to huge data stores that needs to be replicated and scaled according to the  needs of the company and centralized governance of the flows.  Microservices aim for decentralization. Instead of having a huge database, why not  split the data according to the business units explained earlier?  Some of the readers could use the transactionality as one of the main reasons for not  doing it. Consider the following scenario:  1.  A customer buys an item in our microservices-oriented online shop. 2.  When paying for the item, the system issues the following calls:  1.  A call to the financial system of the company to create a transaction   with the payment.  2.  A call to the warehouse system to dispatch the book. 3.  A call to the mailing system to subscribe the customer to the   newsletter.  [ 9 ]   In a monolithic software, all the calls would be wrapped in a transaction, so if, for  some reason, any of the calls fails, the data on the other calls won't be persisted   in the database.  When you learn about designing databases, one of the first and the most important  principles are summarized by the ACID acronym:     Atomicity: Each transaction will be all or nothing. If one part fails, no   changes are persisted on the database.     Consistency: Changes to the data through transactions need to guarantee its   consistency. Isolation: The result of concurrent execution of transactions results in a  system state that would be obtained if the transactions were executed serially.         Durability: Once the transaction is committed, the data persists.  On a microservices-oriented software, the ACID principle is not guaranteed globally.  Microservices will commit the transaction locally, but there are no mechanisms that  can guarantee a 100% integrity of the global transaction. It would be possible to  dispatch the book without processing the payment, unless we factor in specific rules  to prevent it.  On a microservices-oriented architecture, the transactionality of the data is not  guaranteed, so we need to factor the failure into the implementation. A way to solve   although, workaround is a more appropriate word  this problem is decentralizing  the governance and data storage.  When building microservices, we need to embed in the design, the fact that one  or more components could fail and degrade the functionality according to the  availability of the software.  [ 10 ]   Let's take a look at the following diagram:  This diagram represents the sequence of execution on a monolithic software. A  sequential list of calls that, no matter what, are going to be executed following the  ACID principle: either all the calls  transactions  succeed or none of them do.  This is only possible as the framework and database engine designers have  developed the concept of transactions to guarantee the transactionality of the data.  When working with microservices, we need to account for what the engineers  call eventual consistency. After a partial fail on a transaction, each microservice  instance should store the information required to recover the transaction so that the  information will be eventually consistent. Following the previous example, if we send  the book without processing the payment, the payment gateway will have a failed  transaction that someone will process later on, making the data consistent again.  The best way to solve this problem is decentralizing the governance. Every endpoint  should be able to take a local decision that affects the global scope of the transaction.  We will talk more about this subject in Chapter 3, From the Monolith to Microservices.  [ 11 ]   Technology alignment When building a new software, there is always a concept that every developer  should keep in mind: standards. Standards guarantee that your service will be technologically independent so that   it will be easy to build the integrations using a different programming language   or technologies.  One of the advantages of modeling a system with microservices is that we can  choose the right technology for the right job so that we can be quite efficient when  tackling problems. When building monolithic software, it is fairly hard to combine  technologies like we can do with microservices. Usually, in a monolithic software,  we are tied to the technology that we choose in the beginning. Java Remote Method Invocation  RMI  is one example of the non-standard protocols  that should be avoided if you want your system to be open to new technologies. It is  a great way of connecting software components written in Java, but the developers  will struggle  if not fail  to invoke an RMI method using Node.js. This will tie our  architecture to a given language, which from the microservices point of view, will kill  one of the most interesting advantages: technology heterogeneity.  How small is too small? Once we have decided to model our system as a set of microservices, there is always  one question that needs an answer: how small is too small? The answer is always tricky and probably disappointing: it depends.  The right size of the microservices in a given system depends on the structure of  the company as well as the ability to create software components that are easily  manageable by a small team of developers. It also depends on the technical needs.  Imagine a system that receives and processes banking files; as you are probably  aware, all the payments between banks are sent in files with a specific known  format  such as Single Euro Payments Area  SEPA  for Euro payments . One of the  particularities of this type of systems is the large number of different files that the  system needs to know how to process.  The first approach for this problem is tackling it from the microservices point of  view, separating it from any other service creating a unit of work, and creating one  microservice for each type of file. It will enable us to be able to rollout modifications  for the existing file processors without interfering with the rest of the system.  It will also enable us to keep processing files even though one of the services is  experiencing problems.  [ 12 ]   The microservices should be as small as needed, but keep in mind that every  microservice adds an overhead to the operations team that needs to manage a new  service. Try to answer the question how small is too small? in terms of manageability,  scalability, and specialization. The microservice should be small enough to be  managed and scaled up  or down  quickly without affecting the rest of the system,  by a single person; and it should do only one thing.  As a general rule, a microservice should be small  enough to be completely rewritten in a sprint.  Key benefits In the previous topic, we talked about what a microservices-oriented architecture is.  I also exposed the design principles that I have learned from experience, as well as  showed a few benefits of this type of architecture.  Now, it is time to outline these key benefits and show how they will help us to  improve the quality of our software, as well as be able to quickly accommodate the  new business requirements.  Resilience Resilience is defined in Wikipedia as the ability of a system to cope with change. I like  to think about resilience as the ability of a system to gracefully recover from an exception   transitory hardware failure, unexpectedly high network latency, and so on  or a  stress period without affecting the performance of the system once the situation has  been resolved.  Although it sounds simple, when building microservices-oriented software, the  source of problems broadens due to the distributed nature of the system, sometimes  making it hard  or even impossible  to prevent all abnormal situations.  Resilience is the ability to gracefully recover from errors. It also adds another level of  complexity: if one microservice is experiencing problems, can we prevent a general  failure? Ideally, we should build our system in a way that the service response is  degraded instead of resulting in a general failure, although this is not always easy.  [ 13 ]   Scalability Nowadays, one of the common problems in companies is the scalability of the  systems. If you have worked on a monolithic software before, I am sure that you have  experienced capacity problems at some point, alongside the growth of the company.  Usually, these problems are not across all the layers or subsystems of the application.  There is always a subsystem or service that performs significantly slower than the  rest, causing the entire application to fail if it is not able to cope with the demand.  The following diagram describes how a microservice can be scaled up  two mailing  services  without interfering with the rest of the system:  [ 14 ]   An example of these weak points in the world of car insurance is the  service that calculates the quote for a given list of risk factors. Would it  make sense to scale the full application just to satisfy the demand for this  particular part? If the answer that you have in mind is no, you are one  step closer to embracing microservices. Microservices enable you to scale  parts of the system as the demand ramps up for a particular area of it.  If our insurance system was a microservice-oriented software, the only thing needed  to resolve the high demand for quote calculations would've been to spawn more  instances of the microservice  or microservices  responsible for their calculation. Please  bear in mind that scaling up services could add an overhead for operating them.  Technology heterogeneity The world of software is changing every few months. New languages are coming  to the industry as a de facto standard for a certain type of systems. A few years  ago, Ruby on Rails appeared at the scene and rose as one of the most used web  frameworks for new projects in 2013. Golang  a language created by Google  is  becoming a trend nowadays as it combines huge performance with an elegant  and simple syntax that can be learned by anyone with some experience in another  programming language in a matter of days.  In the past, I have used Python and Java as successful alternatives to write  microservices.  Java especially, since Spring Boot was released, is an attractive technology stack to  write agile  to write and operate  microservices.  Django, is also a powerful framework on Python to write microservices. Being very  similar to Ruby on Rails, it automates database migrations and makes the creation of  CRUD  Create Read Update Delete  services an incredibly easy task. Node.js took the advantage of a well-known language, JavaScript, to create a new  server-side stack that is changing the way engineers create new software. So, what is wrong in combining all of them? In all fairness, it is an advantage: we can  choose the right tool for the right job.  Microservices-oriented architectures enable you to do it, as long as the integration  technologies are standard. As you learned before, a microservice is a small and  independent piece of software that can operate by itself.  [ 15 ]   The following diagram shows how the microservices hide data storage gathering,  having only the communication points in common—making them a good example  of low coupling  one service implementation change won't interfere with any other  service :  We have talked about performance earlier. There are always parts of our systems  that are under more pressure than others. With modern multicore CPUs, parallel   concurrent  programming could solve some of these performance issues, however,  Node.js is not a good language to parallelize tasks. We could choose to rewrite the  microservice under pressure using a more appropriate language, such as Erlang, to  manage concurrency in a more elegant way. It should take no more than two weeks  to do it.  [ 16 ]   There is a downside to using multiple technologies on the same system: the  developers and system administrators need to know all  or a few  of them.  Companies that embraced microservices usually try to stick with one core technology   in this book, we will be using Node.js  and some auxiliary technologies  although  we will be using Docker to manage the deployments, we could use Capistrano or  Fabricator to manage the releases .  Replaceability Replaceability is the ability to change one component of a system without interfering  with how the system behaves.  When talking about software, replaceability comes along with low coupling. We  should be writing our microservices in a way that the internal logic will not be  exposed to the calling services so that the clients of a given service do not need  to know about how it is implemented, just the interface. Let's take a look at the  following example. It is written in Java as we only need to see the interface to  identify the pitfalls:  public interface GeoIpService {    **    * Checks if an IP is in the country given by an ISO code.    **    boolean isIn String ip, String isoCode  throws       SOAPFaultException; }  This interface, at first look, is self explanatory. It checks whether a given IP is in a  given country and throws a SOAPFaultException, which is a big problem.  If we build the client that consumes this service, factoring into their logic,  capture, and processing of the SoapFaultException, we are exposing internal  implementation details to the outer world and making it hard to replace the  GeoIpService interface. Also, the fact that we are creating a service related to a part  of our application logic is an indication of the creation of a bounded context: a highly  cohesive service or set of services that work together to achieve one purpose.  [ 17 ]   Independence No matter how hard we try, the human brain is not designed to solve complex  problems. The most efficient mode of functioning for the human brain is   one thing at the time so that we break down complex problems into smaller ones.  Microservices-oriented architectures should follow this approach: all the services  should be independent and interact through the interface up to a point that they can  be developed by different groups of engineers without any interaction, aside from  agreeing the interfaces. This will enable a company adopting microservices to scale  up, or down, the engineering teams, depending on the business needs, making the  business agile in responding to peaks of demand or periods of quietness.  Why is replaceability important? In a previous section, we talked about the right size of a microservice. As a general  rule of thumb, a team should be able to rewrite and deploy a microservice in a sprint.  The reason behind it is the technical debt. I would define technical debt as the deviation from the original technical design  to deliver the expected functionality within a planned deadline. Some of these  sacrifices or wrong assumptions often lead to poorly written software that needs to  be completely refactored or rewritten.  In the preceding example, the interface is exposing to the outer world the fact that  we are using SOAP to call a web service, but we will need to change the code on the  client side as a REST client has certainly nothing to do with SOAP exceptions.  Easy to deploy Microservices should be easy to deploy.  Being software developers, we are well aware that a lot of things could go wrong,  preventing a software from being deployed.  Microservices, as stated before, should be easy to deploy for a number of reasons, as  stated in the following list:     Small amount of business logic  remember the two weeks re-write from scratch   rule of thumb  leading into simpler deployments.     Microservices are autonomous units of work, so upgrading a service is a  contained problem on a complex system. No need to re-deploy the entire  system.  [ 18 ]       Infrastructure and configuration on microservices architectures should be  automated as much as possible. Later in the book, we will learn how to use  Docker to deploy microservices and what are the benefits over the traditional  deployment techniques are.  SOA versus microservices Service-Oriented Architectures  SOA  has been around for a number of years. SOA  is a great principle to design software. They are self-contained components providing  services to other components. As we agreed before, it is all about maintaining low  coupling on the different modules of the system as if it was a puzzle so that we can  replace the pieces without causing a big impact on the overall system.  In principle, SOA looks very similar to microservices architectures. So what is   the difference?  Microservices are fine-grained SOA components. In other words, a single SOA  component can be decomposed in a number of microservices that can work together  in order to provide the same level of functionality:  [ 19 ]   Microservices are fine-grained SOA components.  They are lightweight services with a narrow focus.  Another difference between microservices and SOA is the technologies used for  interconnecting and writing the services.  J2EE is a technology stack that was designed to write SOA architectures as it  enforced enterprise standards. Java Naming and Directory Interface, Enterprise  Java Beans, and Enterprise Service Bus  ESB  were the ecosystems where SOA  applications were built and maintained. Although ESB is a standard, very few  engineers who graduated after 2005 have heard about ESB, even fewer have used it,  and nowadays the modern frameworks such as Ruby on Rails do not even consider  such complex pieces of software.  On the other hand, microservices enforce the use of standards  such as HTTP  that  are broadly known and broadly interoperable. We can choose the right language or  tool to build a component  microservice  following one of the key benefits explained  earlier in this chapter, in the Technology heterogeneity section.  Aside from the technology stack and the size of the services, there is an even bigger  difference between SOA and microservices: the domain model. Earlier in this  chapter, we have talked about decentralization. Decentralization of the governance,  but, moreover, decentralization of the data. In a microservices-based software, every  microservice should store its own data locally, isolating the domain models to a  single service; whereas, on an SOA oriented-software, the data is usually stored in a  few big databases and the services share the domain models.  Why Node.js? A few years ago, I didn't believe in Node.js. To me, it was a trend more than a  real tool to solve problems… JavaScript in the server? That didn't look right. In all  fairness, I didn't even like JavaScript. Then, the modern frameworks such as jQuery  or Angular.js came to the rescue. They solved one of the problems, which was the  cross-browser compatibility. Where before we needed to factor in at least three  different browsers, after jQuery all this logic was nicely encapsulated in a library   so that we didn't need to worry about compatibility as long as we followed the  jQuery documentation.  Then, JavaScript became more popular. Suddenly, all the internal tools were written  with Single-Page Application  SPA  frameworks with a heavy usage of JavaScript,  therefore, the majority of developers nowadays, one way or another, are proficient   in JavaScript.  [ 20 ]   Then, someone decided to take JavaScript out of the browser, which was a great  idea. Rhino, Node.js, and Nashorn are examples of runtimes that can execute  standalone JavaScript. Some of them can even interact with the Java code, enabling  the developer to import Java classes into a JavaScript program, which gives you the  access to an endless set of frameworks already written in Java. Let's focus on Node.js. Node.js is the perfect candidate for microservices-oriented  architectures for a number of reasons, as stated in the following list:     Easy to learn  although it can be hard to master     Easy to scale    Highly testable    Easy to deploy    Dependency management through npm    There are hundreds of libraries to integrate with the majority of standard   protocols  These reasons, along with others that we will develop in the following chapters,  make Node.js the perfect candidate for building solid microservices.  API aggregation Seneca is the framework that I have chosen for development in the following  chapters. One of the most attractive characteristics of Seneca is API aggregation.  API aggregation is an advanced technique to compose an interface by aggregating  different functionalities  plugins, methods, and so on  to it.  Let's take a look at the following example:  var express = require 'express' ; var app = express  ;  app.get ' sayhello', function  req, res  {   res.send 'Hello World!' ; } ; app.get ' saygoodbye', function req, res  {   res.send 'Bye bye!' ; } ;  var server = app.listen 3000, function    {   var host = server.address  .address;   var port = server.address  .port;   console.log 'App listening at http:  %s:%s', host, port ; } ;  [ 21 ]   The preceding example uses Express, a very popular web framework for Node.js.  This framework is also built around the API aggregation technique. Let's take a look  at the fourth and seventh lines. In these lines, the developer registers two methods  that are to be executed when someone hits the URLs  sayhello and  saygoodbye  with a GET request. In other words, the application is composed of different smaller  and independent implementations that are exposed to the outer world on a single  interface, in this case, an app listening on the 3000 port.  In the following chapters, I will explain why this property is important and how to  take advantage of it when building  and scaling  microservices.  The future of Node.js JavaScript was first designed to be a language executed in the web browser. For  those who worked or studied, using C C++ was very familiar and that was the key  for its adoption as a standard for the dynamic manipulation of documents in Web  2.0. Asynchronous JavaScript and XML  AJAX  was the detonator for JavaScript  growth. Different browsers had different implementations of the request objects so  that the developers had a hard time to write a cross-browser code.  The lack of standards led to the creation of many frameworks that encapsulated the  logic behind AJAX, making easy-to-write cross-browser scripts.  JavaScript is a script language. It was not designed to be object oriented, neither was  it designed to be the language of choice for large applications as the code tends to  get chaotic and it is hard to enforce standards across different companies on how  the code should be laid out. Every single company where I worked has different best  practices and some of them are even contradictory. European Computer Manufacturers Association  ECMA  came to the rescue.  ECMAScript 6, the next standard for ECMA languages  JavaScript, ActionScript,  Rhino, and so on  introduces the concept of classes, inheritance, collections, and a  number of interesting features that will make the development of JavaScript software  easier and more standard than the actual V8 specification. One of these features that I consider more interesting is the introduction of the class  keyword that allows us to model our JavaScript software with objects.  At the moment, the majority of browsers support a large number of these features, but  when it comes to Node.js, only a few of them are implemented by default and some of  them are implemented by passing special flags to the interpreter  harmony flags .  In this book, I will try to avoid the ECMAScript 6 features, sticking to the V8  specification as it is widely known by the majority of developers and, once someone  knows JavaScript V8, it is fairly easy to ramp up on ECMAScript 6.  [ 22 ]   Summary In this chapter, we studied the key concepts around microservices, as well as the best  practices to be followed when designing high-quality software components towards  building robust and resilient software architectures that enable us to respond quickly  to the business needs.  You have also learned the key benefits such as the possibility of using the right  language for the right service  technology heterogeneity  on the microservices-oriented  architectures as well as some of the pitfalls that could make our life harder, such as   the overhead on the operational side caused by the distributed nature of the  microservices-oriented architectures.  Finally, we discussed why Node.js is a great tool for building microservices, as well  as how we could benefit from JavaScript to build high-quality software components  through techniques like API aggregation.  In the following chapters, we will be developing the concepts discussed in this  chapter, with code examples and further explanation about the topics I have   learned over the years.  As explained before, we will focus on the V8 version of JavaScript, but I will   provide some hints on how to easily write upgradeable components to embrace  ECMAScript 6.  [ 23 ]    Microservices in   Node.js – Seneca and   PM2 Alternatives  In this chapter, you will mainly learn about two frameworks, Seneca and PM2, and  why they are important for building microservices. We will also get to know the  alternatives to these frameworks in order to get a general understanding of what  is going on in the Node.js ecosystem. In this chapter, we are going to focus on the  following topics:     Need for Node.js: In this section, we are going to justify the choice of Node.  js as a framework to build our microservices-oriented software. We will walk  through the software stack required to use this awesome technology.     Seneca – a microservices framework: In this section, you will learn the basics   of Seneca and why it is the right choice if we want to keep our software  manageable. We will explain how to integrate Seneca with Express  the most  popular web server in Node.js  in order to follow the industry standards.    PM2: PM2 is the best choice to run Node.js applications. No matter what   your problem in deploying your ecosystem of apps is, PM2 will always have  a solution for it.  Need for Node.js In the previous chapter, I mentioned that I wasn't a big fan of Node.js in the past. The  reason for this was that I wasn't prepared to cope with the level of standardization  that JavaScript was undergoing.  [ 25 ]   JavaScript in the browser was painful. Cross-browser compatibility was always a  problem and the lack of standardization didn't help to ease the pain.  Then Node.js came and it was easy to create highly scalable applications due to its  non-blocking nature  we will talk about it later in this chapter  and it was also very  easy to learn as it was based on JavaScript, a well-known language.  Nowadays, Node.js is the preferred choice for a large number of companies across  the world, as well as the number one choice for aspects that require a non-blocking  nature in the server, such as web sockets.  In this book, we will primarily  but not only  use Seneca and PM2 as the frameworks  for building and running microservices, but it does not mean that the alternatives are  not good. There are few alternatives in the market such as restify or Express for building  applications and forever or nodemon to run them. However, I find Seneca and   PM2 to be the most appropriate combination for building microservices for the  following reasons:     PM2 is extremely powerful regarding application deployments    Seneca is not only a framework to build microservices, but it is also a  paradigm that reshapes what we know about object-oriented software  We will be using Express in a few examples in the chapters of this book and we will  also discuss how to integrate Seneca in Express as a middleware.  However, before that, let's discuss some concepts around Node.js that will help us to  understand those frameworks.  Installing Node.js, npm, Seneca, and PM2 Node.js is fairly easy to install. Depending on your system, there is an installer  available that makes the installation of Node.js and npm  Node Package Manager  a  fairly simple task. Simply double-click on it and follow the instructions. At the time  of writing this book, there are installers available for Windows and OSX.  However, the advanced users, especially DevOps engineers, will need to install  Node.js and npm from the sources or binaries.  [ 26 ]   Both Node.js and npm programs come bundled together in a single  package that we can download for various platforms from the Node.js  website  either sources or binaries : https:  nodejs.org en download   For the Chef users, a popular configuration management software to build servers,  there are few options available, but the most popular is the following recipe  for  those unfamiliar with Chef, a recipe is basically a script to install or configure  software in a server through Chef :  https:  github.com redguide nodejs  At the time of writing this book, there are binaries available for Linux.  Learning npm npm is a software that comes with Node.js and enables you to pull dependencies  from the Internet without worrying about their management. It can also be used to  maintain and update dependencies, as well as create projects from scratch.  As you probably know, every node app comes with a package.json file. This  file describes the configuration of the project  dependencies, versions, common  commands, and so on . Let's see the following example:  {   "name": "test-project",   "version": "1.0.0",   "description": "test project",   "main": "index.js",   "scripts": {   "test": "grunt validate --verbose"   },   "author": "David Gonzalez",   "license": "ISC" }  The file itself is self-explanatory. There is an interesting section in the file—scripts.  In this section, we can specify the command that is used to run for different  actions. In this case, if we run npm test from the terminal, npm will execute grunt  validate --verbose.  Node applications are usually as easy to run as executing the following command:  node index.js  [ 27 ]   In the root of your project, consider that the bootstrapping file is index.js. If this is  not the case, the best thing you can do is add a subsection in the scripts section in  package.json, as follows:  "scripts": {   "test": "grunt validate --verbose"   "start": "node index.js" },  As you can see, now we have two commands executing the same program:  node index.js  npm start  The benefits of using npm start are quite obvious—uniformity. No matter how  complex your application is, npm start will always run it  if you have configured  the scripts section correctly .  Let's install Seneca and PM2 on a clean project.  First, execute npm init in a new folder from the terminal after installing Node.js.  You should get a prompt similar to the following image:  npm will ask you for a few parameters to configure your project, and once you are  done, it writes a package.json file with content similar to the preceding code.  Now we need to install the dependencies; npm will do that for us. Just run the  following command:  npm install --save seneca  [ 28 ]   Now, if you inspect package.json again, you can see that there is a new section  called dependencies that contains an entry for Seneca:  "dependencies": {   "seneca": "^0.7.1" }  This means that from now on, our app can require the Seneca module and the  require   function will be able to find it. There are a few variations of the save flag,  as follows:     save: This saves the dependency in the dependencies section. It is available   through all the development life cycle.     save-dev: This saves the dependency in the devDependencies section. It is   only available in development and does not get deployed into production.     save-optional: This adds a dependency  such as save , but lets npm  continue if the dependency can't be found. It is up to the app to handle   the lack of this dependency.  Let's continue with PM2. Although it can be used as a library, PM2 is mainly a  command tool, like ls or grep in any Unix system. npm does a great job installing  command-line tools:  npm install –g pm2  The –g flags instruct npm to globally install PM2, so it is available in the system, not  in the app. This means that when the previous command finishes, pm2 is available   as a command in the console. If you run pm2 help in a terminal, you can see the   help of PM2.  Our first program – Hello World One of the most interesting concepts around Node.js is simplicity. You can learn  Node.js in few days and master it in a few weeks, as long as you are familiar with  JavaScript. Code in Node.js tends to be shorter and clearer than in other languages:  var http = require 'http' ;  var server = http.createServer function  request, response  {   response.writeHead 200, {"Content-Type": "text plain"} ;   response.end "Hello World\n" ; } ;  server.listen 8000 ;  [ 29 ]   The preceding code creates a server that listens on the 8000 port for requests. If you  don't believe it, open a browser and type http:  127.0.0.1:8000 in the navigation  bar, as shown in the following screenshot:  Let's explain the code:     The first line loads the http module. Through the require   instruction, we  ask the node to load the http module and assign the export of this module to  the http variable. Exporting language elements is the way that Node.js has to  expose functions and variables to the outer world from inside a module.    The second construction in the script creates the HTTP server. The http   module creates and exposes a method called createServer   that receives  a function  remember JavaScript treats functions as first-level objects so that  they can be passed as other functions arguments  as a parameter that, in  the Node.js world, is called callback. A callback is an action to be executed  as a response to an event. In this case, the event is that the script receives  an HTTP request. Node.js has a heavy usage of callbacks due to its thread  model. Your application will always be executed on a single thread so that  not blocking the application thread while waiting for operations to complete  and prevents our application from looking stalled or hanged. Otherwise,  your program won't be responsive. We'll come back to this in Chapter 4,  Writing Your First Microservice in Node.js. In the next line, server.listen 8000  starts the server. From now on, every  time our server receives a request, the callback on the http.createServer    function will be executed.      [ 30 ]   This is it. Simplicity is the key to Node.js programs. The code allows you to go to the  point without writing tons of classes, methods, and config objects that complicate what,  in the first instance, can be done much more simply: write a script that serves requests.  Node.js threading model Programs written in Node.js are single-threaded. The impact of this is quite  significant; in the previous example, if we have ten thousand concurrent requests,  they will be queued and satisfied by the Node.js event loop  it will be further  explained in Chapter 4, Writing Your First Microservice in Node.js and Chapter 6,   Testing and Documenting Node.js Microservices  one by one.  At first glance, this sounds wrong. I mean, the modern CPUs can handle multiple  parallel requests due to their multicore nature. So, what is the benefit of executing  them in one thread?  The answer to this question is that Node.js was designed to handle asynchronous  processing. This means that in the event of a slow operation such as reading a file,  instead of blocking the thread, Node.js allows the thread to continue satisfying other  events, and then the control process of the node will execute the method associated  with the event, processing the response.  Sticking to the previous example, the createServer   method accepts a callback  that will be executed in the event of an HTTP request, but meanwhile, the thread is  free to keep executing other actions.  The catch in this model is what Node.js developers call the callback hell. The code  gets complicated as every single action that is a response to a blocking action has  to be processed on a callback, like in the previous example; the function used as a  parameter to the createServer   method is a good example.  Modular organization best practices The source code organization for big projects is always controversial. Different  developers have different approaches to how to order the source code in order to  keep the chaos away.  Some languages such as Java or C organize the code in packages so that we can find  source code files that are related inside a package. As an example, if we are writing  a task manager software, inside the com.taskmanager.dao package we can expect  to find classes that implement the data access object  DAO  pattern in order to  access the database. In the same way, in the com.taskmanager.dao.domain.model  package, we can find all the classes that represent model objects  usually tables  in  our application.  [ 31 ]   This is a convention in Java and C. If you are a C developer, and you start working  on an existing project, it only takes you a few days to get used to how the code is  structured as the language enforces the organization of the source.  Javascript JavaScript was first designed to be run inside the browser. The code was supposed to  be embedded in HTML documents so that the Document Object Model  DOM  could  be manipulated to create dynamic effects. Take a look at the following example:               Title of the document        Hello  Mundo        document.getElementById "world" .innerText = 'World';          As you can see, if you load this HTML on a browser, the text inside the span tag with  the id as world is replaced when the page loads.  In JavaScript, there is no concept of dependency management. JavaScript can be  segregated from the HTML into its own file, but there is no way  for now  to include  a JavaScript file into another JavaScript file.  This leads to a big problem. When the project contains dozens of JavaScript files, the  assets management become more of an art than an engineering effort.  The order in which you import the JavaScript files becomes important as the browser  executes the JavaScript files as it finds them. Let's reorder the code in the previous  example to demonstrate it, as follows:               Title of the document          document.getElementById "world" .innerText = 'World';      [ 32 ]         Hello  Mundo        Now, save this HTML in an index.html file and try to load it in any browser,   as shown in the following image:  In this case, I have used Chrome and the console shows an Uncaught TypeError:  Cannot set property 'innerText' of null error in line 7. Why is that happening? As we explained earlier, the browser executes the code as it is found, and it turns out  that when the browser executes the JavaScript, the world element does not exist yet.  Fortunately, Node.js has solved the dependency-loading problem using a very  elegant and standard approach.  SOLID design principles When talking about microservices, we always talk about modularity, and modularity  always boils down to the following  SOLID  design principles:     Single responsibility principle    Open for extension, closed for modification    Liskov substitution       Dependency inversion  inversion of control and dependency injection   Interface segregation  [ 33 ]   You want your code to be organized in modules. A module is an aggregation of  code that does something simple, such as manipulating strings, and it does it well.  The more functions  or classes, utilities, and so on  your module contains, the less  cohesive it is, and we are trying to avoid that.  In Node.js, every JavaScript file is a module by default. We can also use folders as  modules, but let's focus on files:  function contains a, b  {   return a.indexOf b  > -1; }  function stringToOrdinal str  {   var result = ""   for  var i = 0, len = str.length; i < len; i++  {     result += charToNumber str[i] ;   }   return result; }  function charToNumber char  {   return char.charCodeAt 0  - 96; }  module.exports = {   contains: contains,   stringToOrdinal: stringToOrdinal }  The preceding code represents a valid module in Node.js. In this case, the module  contains three functions, where two of them are exposed to the outside of the module.  In Node.js, this is done through the module.exports variable. Whatever you assign  to this variable is going to be visible by the calling code so that we can simulate  private content on a module, such as the charToNumber   function in this case.  So, if we want to use this module, we just need to require   it, as follows:  var stringManipulation = require ". string-manipulation" ; console.log stringManipulation.stringToOrdinal "aabb"  ;  This should output 1122.  [ 34 ]   Let's go back to the SOLID principles and see how our module looks:     Single responsibility principle: Our module only deals with strings    Open for extension, closed for modification: We can add more functions,   but the ones that we have are correct and they can be used to build new  functions in the module     Liskov substitution: We will skip this one, as the structure of the module is       irrelevant to fulfil this principle Interface segregation: JavaScript is not a language that counts with an  interface element such as Java or C, but in this module, we exposed the  interface, and the module.exports variable will act as a contract for the  calling code and the change in our implementation won't affect how the  module is being called     Dependency inversion: Here is where we fail, not fully, but enough to   reconsider our approach  In this case, we require the module, and the only way to interact with it is through  the global scope. If, inside the module, we want to interact with data from outside,  the only possible option is to create a global variable  or function  prior to requiring  the module, and then assume that it is always going to be in there.  Global variables are a big problem in Node.js. As you are probably aware,   in JavaScript, if you omit the var keyword when declaring a variable, it is  automatically global.  This, coupled with the fact that intentional global variables create a data coupling  between modules  coupling is what we want to avoid at any cost , is the reason   to find a better approach to how to define the modules for our microservices    or in general .  Let's restructure the code as follows:  function init options  {      function charToNumber char  {     return char.charCodeAt 0  - 96;   }      function StringManipulation   {   }      var stringManipulation = new StringManipulation  ;      stringManipulation.contains = function a, b  {  [ 35 ]       return a.indexOf b  > -1;   };      stringManipulation.stringToOrdinal = function str  {     var result = ""     for  var i = 0, len = str.length; i < len; i++  {       result += charToNumber str[i] ;     }     return result;   }   return stringManipulation; }  module.exports = init;  This looks a bit more complicated, but once you get used to it, the benefits are  enormous:     We can pass configuration parameters to the module  such as debugging      Avoids the pollution of global scope as if everything is wrapped inside a   function, and we enforce the use strict configuration  this avoids declarations  without var with a compilation error      Parameterizing a module makes it easy to mock behaviors and data    information   for testing  In this book, we are going to be writing a good amount of code to model systems  from the microservices prospective. We will try to keep this pattern as much as we  can so that we can see the benefits.  One of the library that we are going to be using to build microservices, Seneca, follows  this pattern, as well as a large number of libraries that can be found on Internet.  Seneca – a microservices framework Seneca is a framework for building microservices written by Richard Rodger, the  founder and CTO of nearForm, a consultancy that helps other companies design and  implement software using Node.js. Seneca is about simplicity, it connects services  through a sophisticated pattern-matching interface that abstracts the transport from  the code so that it is fairly easy to write highly scalable software.  [ 36 ]   Let's stop talking and see some examples:  var seneca = require  'seneca'      seneca.add {role: 'math', cmd: 'sum'}, function  msg, respond  {   var sum = msg.left + msg.right   respond null, {answer: sum}  }   seneca.add {role: 'math', cmd: 'product'}, function  msg, respond  {   var product = msg.left * msg.right   respond  null, { answer: product }   }   seneca.act {role: 'math', cmd: 'sum', left: 1, right: 2},     console.log      seneca.act {role: 'math', cmd: 'product', left: 3, right: 4},     console.log   As you can see, the code is self-explanatory:     Seneca comes as a module, so the first thing that needs to be done is to  require   it. Seneca package is wrapped in a function, so invoking the  function initializes the library.     Next two instructions are related to a concept explained in Chapter 1,   Microservices Architecture: API composition. The seneca.add   method  instructs Seneca to add a function that will be invoked with a set of patterns.  For the first one, we specify an action that will take place when Seneca  receives the {role: math, cmd: sum} command. For the second one, the  pattern is {role: math, cmd: product}.     The last line sends a command to Seneca that will be executed by the service   that matches the pattern passed as the first parameter. In this case, it will  match the first service as role and cmd match. The second call to act will  match the second service.  Write the code in a file called index.js in the project that we created earlier   in this chapter  remember that we installed Seneca and PM2 , and run the   following command:  node index.js  [ 37 ]   The output will be something similar to the following image:  We will talk about this output later in order to explain exactly what it means, but if  you are used to enterprise applications, you can almost guess what is going on.  The last two lines are the responses from the two services: the first one executes 1+2  and the second one executes 3*4.  The null output that shows up as the first word in the last two lines corresponds to a  pattern that is widely used in JavaScript: the error first callback.  Let's explain it with a code example:  var seneca = require  'seneca'      seneca.add {role: 'math', cmd: 'sum'}, function  msg, respond  {   var sum = msg.left + msg.right   respond null, {answer: sum}  }   seneca.add {role: 'math', cmd: 'product'}, function  msg, respond  {   var product = msg.left * msg.right   respond  null, { answer: product }   }   seneca.act {role: 'math', cmd: 'sum', left: 1, right: 2},     function err, data  {   if  err  {     return console.error err ;   }   console.log data ; } ; seneca.act {role: 'math', cmd: 'product', left: 3, right: 4},     console.log ;  The previous code rewrites the first invocation to Seneca with a more appropriate  approach. Instead of dumping everything into the console, process the response from  Seneca, which is a callback where the first parameter is the error, if one happened   null otherwise , and the second parameter is the data coming back from the  microservice. This is why, in the first example, null was the first output into   the console.  [ 38 ]   In the world of Node.js, it is very common to use callbacks. Callbacks are a way of  indicating to the program that something has happened, without being blocked until  the result is ready to be processed. Seneca is not an exception to this. It relies heavily  on callbacks to process the response to service calls, which makes more sense when  you think about microservices being deployed in different machines  in the previous  example, everything runs in the same machine , especially because the network  latency can be something to factor into the design of your software.  Inversion of control done right Inversion of control is a must in modern software. It comes together with the  dependency injection. Inversion of control can be defined as a technique to delegate the creation or call of  components and methods so that your module does not need to know how to build the  dependencies, which usually, are obtained through the dependency injection.  Seneca does not really make use of the dependency injection, but it is the perfect  example of inversion of control.  Let's take a look at the following code:  var seneca = require 'seneca'   ; seneca.add {component: 'greeter'}, function msg, respond  {   respond null, {message: 'Hello ' + msg.name} ; } ; seneca.act {component: 'greeter', name: 'David'}, function error,     response  {   if error  return console.log error ;   console.log response.message ; } ;  This is the most basic Seneca example. From enterprise software's point of view, we  can differentiate two components here: a producer  Seneca.add    and a consumer   Seneca.act   . As mentioned earlier, Seneca does not have a dependency injection  system as is, but Seneca is gracefully built around the inversion of control principle. In the Seneca.act   function, we don't explicitly call the component that holds the  business logic; instead of that, we ask Seneca to resolve the component for us through  the use of an interface, in this case, a JSON message. This is inversion of control. Seneca is quite flexible around it: no keywords  except for integrations  and no  mandatory fields. It just has a combination of keywords and values that are used by  a pattern matching engine called Patrun.  [ 39 ]   Pattern matching in Seneca Pattern matching is one of the most flexible software patterns that you can use   for microservices.  As opposed to network addresses or messages, patterns are fairly easy to extend.  Let's explain it with the help of the following example:  var seneca = require 'seneca'   ; seneca.add {cmd: 'wordcount'}, function msg, respond  {   var length = msg.phrase.split ' ' .length;   respond null, {words: length} ; } ;  seneca.act {cmd: 'wordcount', phrase: 'Hello world this is     Seneca'}, function err, response  {   console.log response ; } ;  It is a service that counts the number of words in a sentence. As we have seen before,  in the first line, we add the handler for the wordcount command, and in the second  one, we send a request to Seneca to count the number of words in a phrase.  If you execute it, you should get something similar to the following image:  By now, you should be able to understand how it works and even make some  modifications to it.  Let's extend the pattern. Now, we want to skip the short words, as follows:  var seneca = require 'seneca'   ;  seneca.add {cmd: 'wordcount'}, function msg, respond  {   var length = msg.phrase.split ' ' .length;   respond null, {words: length} ; } ;  seneca.add {cmd: 'wordcount', skipShort: true}, function msg,     respond  {   var words = msg.phrase.split ' ' ;   var validWords = 0;   for  var i = 0; i < words.length; i++  {  [ 40 ]       if  words[i].length > 3  {       validWords++;     }   }   respond null, {words: validWords} ; } ;  seneca.act {cmd: 'wordcount', phrase: 'Hello world this is     Seneca'}, function err, response  {   console.log response ; } ;  seneca.act {cmd: 'wordcount', skipShort: true, phrase: 'Hello     world this is Seneca'}, function err, response  {   console.log response ; } ;  As you can see, we have added another handler for the wordcount command with  an extra skipShort parameter.  This handler now skips all the words with three or fewer characters. If you execute  the preceding code, the output is similar to the following image:  The first line, {words: 5}, corresponds to the first act call. The second line, {words:  4}, corresponds to the second call.  Patrun – a pattern-matching library Patrun is also written by Richard Rodger. It is used by Seneca in order to execute the  pattern matching and decide which service should respond to the call. Patrun uses a closest match approach to resolve the calls. Let's see the following  example:  In the preceding image, we can see three patterns. These are equivalent to seneca. add   from the example in the previous section.  [ 41 ]   In this case, we are registering three different combinations of x and y variables.  Now, let's see how Patrun does the matching:     {x: 1} ->A: This matches 100% with A    {x: 2} ->: No match    {x:1, y:1} -> B: 100% match with B; it also matches with A, but B is a   better match—two out of two vs one out of one     {x:1, y:2} -> C: 100% match with C; again, it also matches with A, but C   is more concrete     {y: 1} ->: No match  As you can see, Patrun  and Seneca  will always get the longest match. In this way,  we can easily extend the functionality of the more abstract patterns by concreting   the matching.  Reusing patterns In the preceding example, in order to skip the words with fewer than three  characters, we don't reuse the word count function.  In this case, it is quite hard to reuse the function as is; although the problem sounds  very similar, the solution barely overlaps.  However, let's go back to the example where we add two numbers:  var seneca = require  'seneca'      seneca.add {role: 'math', cmd: 'sum'}, function  msg, respond  {   var sum = msg.left + msg.right   respond null, {answer: sum}  } ;  seneca.add {role: 'math', cmd: 'sum', integer: true}, function      msg, respond  {   this.act {role: 'math', cmd: 'sum', left: Math.floor msg.left ,       right: Math.floor msg.right },respond ; } ;  seneca.act {role: 'math', cmd: 'sum', left: 1.5, right: 2.5},     console.log   seneca.act {role: 'math', cmd: 'sum', left: 1.5, right: 2.5,     integer: true}, console.log   As you can see, the code has changed a bit. Now, the pattern that accepts an integer  relies on the base pattern to calculate the sum of the numbers.  [ 42 ]   Patrun always tries to match the closest and most concrete pattern that it can find  with the following two dimensions:    The longest chain of matches    The order of the patterns  It will always try to find the best fit, and if there is an ambiguity, it will match the  first pattern found.  In this way, we can rely on already-existing patterns to build new services.  Writing plugins Plugins are an important part of applications based on Seneca. As we discussed  in Chapter 1, Microservices Architecture, the API aggregation is the perfect way of  building applications.  Node.js' most popular frameworks are built around this concept: small pieces of  software that are combined to create a bigger system.  Seneca is also built around this; Seneca.add   principle adds a new piece to the  puzzle so that the final API is a mixture of different small software pieces.  Seneca goes one step further and implements an interesting plugin system so that the  common functionality can be modularized and abstracted into reusable components.  The following example is the minimal Seneca plugin:  function minimal_plugin  options   {   console.log options  }  require  'seneca'       .use  minimal_plugin, {foo:'bar'}    Write the code into a minimal-plugin.js file and execute it:  node minimal-plugin.js  The output of this execution should be something similar to the following image:  [ 43 ]   In Seneca, a plugin is loaded at the startup, but we don't see it as the default log level  is INFO. This means that Seneca won't show any DEBUG level info. In order to see  what Seneca is doing, we need to get more information, as follows:  node minimal-plugin.js –seneca.log.all  This produces a huge output. This is pretty much everything that is happening  inside Seneca, which can be very useful to debug complicated situations, but in   this case, what we want to do is show a list of plugins:  node minimal-plugin.js --seneca.log.all  grep plugin  grep DEFINE  It will produce something similar to the following image:  Let's analyze the preceding output:     basic: This plugin is included with the main Seneca module and provides a   small set of basic utility action patterns.     transport: This is the transport plugin. Up until now, we have only   executed different services  quite small and concise  on the same machine,  but what if we want to distribute them? This plugin will help us with that,  and we will see how to do so in the following sections.     web: In Chapter 1, Microservices Architecture, we mentioned that the   microservices should advocate to keep the pipes that connect them under  a standard that is widely used. Seneca uses TCP by default, but creating a  RESTful API can be tricky. This plugin helps to do it, and we will see how to  do this in the following section.     mem-store: Seneca comes with a data abstraction layer so that we can handle  the data storage in different places: Mongo, SQL databases, and so on. Out of  the box, Seneca provides an in-memory storage so that it just works.     minimal_plugin: This is our plugin. So, now we know that Seneca is able to   load it.  The plugin we wrote does nothing. Now, it is time to write something useful:  function math  options   {    this.add {role:'math', cmd: 'sum'}, function  msg, respond   {     respond  null, { answer: msg.left + msg.right }    [ 44 ]     }   }    this.add {role:'math', cmd: 'product'}, function  msg, respond         {     respond  null, { answer: msg.left * msg.right }     }   require  'seneca'       .use  math     .act  'role:math,cmd:sum,left:1,right:2', console.log    First of all, notice that in the last instruction, act   follows a different format.  Instead of passing a dictionary, we pass a string with the same key values as the  first argument, as we did with a dictionary. There is nothing wrong with it, but  my preferred approach is to use the JSON objects  dictionaries , as it is a way of  structuring the data without having syntax problems.  In the previous example, we can see how the code got structured as a plugin. If we  execute it, we can see that the output is similar to the following one:  One of the things you need to be careful about in Seneca is how to initialize your  plugins. The function that wraps the plugin  in the preceding example, the math    function  is executed synchronously by design and it is called the definition function.  If you remember from the previous chapter, Node.js apps are single-threaded.  To initialize a plugin, you add a special init   action pattern. This action pattern  is called in sequence for each plugin. The init   function must call its respond  callback without errors. If the plugin initialization fails, then Seneca exits the Node.js  process. You want your microservices to fail fast  and scream loudly  when there's a  problem. All plugins must complete initialization before any actions are executed.  [ 45 ]   Let's see an example of how to initialize a plugin in the following way:  function init msg, respond  {   console.log "plugin initialized!" ;   console.log "expensive operation taking place now... DONE!" ;   respond  ; }  function math  options   {    this.add {role:'math', cmd: 'sum'}, function  msg, respond   {     respond  null, { answer: msg.left + msg.right }     }     this.add {role:'math', cmd: 'product'}, function  msg, respond         {     respond  null, { answer: msg.left * msg.right }     }       this.add {init: "math"}, init ; } require  'seneca'       .use  math     .act  'role:math,cmd:sum,left:1,right:2', console.log    Then, after executing this file, the output should look very similar to the following  image:  As you can read from the output, the function that initializes the plugin was called.  The general rule in Node.js apps is to never block the thread.  If you find yourself blocking the thread, you might need to  rethink how to avoid it.  [ 46 ]   Web server integration In Chapter 1, Microservices Architecture, we put a special emphasis on using standard  technologies to communicate with your microservices.  Seneca, by default, uses a TCP transport layer that, although it uses TCP, is not easy  to interact with, as the criteria to decide the method that gets executed is based on a  payload sent from the client.  Let's dive into the most common use case: your service is called by JavaScript on  a browser. Although it can be done, it would be much easier if Seneca exposed a  REST API instead of the JSON dialog, which is perfect for communication between  microservices  unless you have ultra-low latency requirements . Seneca is not a web framework. It can be defined as a general purpose microservices  framework, so it would not make too much sense to build it around a concrete case  like the one exposed before.  Instead of that, Seneca was built in a way that makes the integration with other  frameworks fairly easy. Express is the first option when building web applications on Node.js. The amount  of examples and documentation that can be found on Internet about Express makes  the task of learning it fairly easy. Seneca as Express middleware Express was also built under the principle of API composition. Every piece of  software in Express is called middleware, and they are chained in the code in order  to process every request. In this case, we are going to use seneca-web as a middleware for Express so that  once we specify the configuration, all the URLs will follow a naming convention.  Let's consider the following example:  var seneca = require 'seneca'     seneca.add 'role:api,cmd:bazinga',function args,done {   done null,{bar:"Bazinga!"} ; } ; seneca.act 'role:web',{use:{   prefix: ' my-api',   pin: {role:'api',cmd:'*'},    map:{     bazinga: {GET: true}  [ 47 ]     } }}  var express = require 'express'  var app = express   app.use  seneca.export 'web'    app.listen 3000   This code is not as easy to understand as the previous examples, but I'll do my best  to explain it:     The second line adds a pattern to Seneca. We are pretty familiar with it as all   the examples on this book do that.     The third instruction, seneca.act  , is where the magic happens. We are   mounting the patterns with the role:api pattern and any cmd pattern  cmd:*   to react to URLs under  my-api. In this example, the first seneca.add   will  reply to the URL  my-api bazinga, as  my-api  is specified by the prefix  variable and bazinga by the cmd part of the seneca.add   command.     app.use seneca.export 'web'   instructs Express to use seneca-web as   middleware to execute actions based on the configuration rules.     app.listen 3000  binds the port 3000 to Express.  If you remember from an earlier section in this chapter, seneca.act   takes a  function as a second parameter. In this case, we are exposing configuration to be  used by Express on how to map the incoming requests to Seneca actions.  Let's test it:  [ 48 ]   The preceding code is pretty dense, so let's explain it down to the code from   the browser:     Express receives a request that is handled by seneca-web.    The seneca-web plugin was configured to use  my-api  as a prefix, which   is being bound with the keyword pin  refer to seneca.act   from the  preceding code  to Seneca actions  seneca.add    that contain the role:api  pattern, plus any cmd pattern  cmd:* . In this case,  my-api bazinga  corresponds to the first  and only  seneca.add   command with the {role:  'api', cmd: 'bazinga'} pattern.  It takes a while to fully understand the integration between Seneca and Express, but  once it is clear, the flexibility offered by the API composability pattern is limitless.  Express itself is big enough to be out of the scope of this book, but it is worth taking a  look as it is a very popular framework. Data storage Seneca comes with a data-abstraction layer that allows you to interact with the data  of your application in a generic way. By default, Seneca comes with an in-memory plugin  as explained in the previous  section , therefore, it works out of the box.  We are going to be using it for the majority of this book, as the different storage  systems are completely out of scope and Seneca abstracts us from them. Seneca provides a simple data abstraction layer  Object-relational mapping  ORM    based on the following operations:  load: This loads an entity by identifier        save: This creates or updates  if you provide an identifier  an entity        list: This lists entities matching a simple query remove: This deletes an entity by an identifier  [ 49 ]   Let's build a plugin that manages employees in the database:  module.exports = function options  {   this.add {role: 'employee', cmd: 'add'}, function msg, respond {     this.make 'employee' .data$ msg.data .save$ respond ;   } ;      this.find {role: 'employee', cmd: 'get'}, function msg, respond        {     this.make 'employee' .load$ msg.id, respond ;   } ; }  Remember that the database is, by default, in memory, so we don't need to worry  about the table structure for now.  The first command adds an employee to the database. The second command recovers  an employee from the database by id.  Note that all the ORM primitives in Seneca end up with the dollar symbol  $ .  As you can see now, we have been abstracted from the data storage details. If the  application changes in the future and we decide to use MongoDB as a data storage  instead of an in-memory storage, the only thing we need to take care of is the plugin  that deals with MongoDB.  Let's use our employee management plugin, as shown in the following code:  var seneca = require 'seneca'   .use 'employees-storage'  var employee =  {   name: "David",   surname: "Gonzalez",   position: "Software Developer" }  function add_employee   {   seneca.act {role: 'employee', cmd: 'add', data: employee},       function  err, msg  {     console.log msg ;   } ; } add_employee  ;  In the preceding example, we add an employee to the in-memory database by  invoking the pattern exposed in the plugin.  [ 50 ]   Along the book, we will see different examples about how to use the data abstraction  layer, but the main focus will be on how to build microservices and not how to deal  with the different data storages.  PM2 – a task runner for Node.js PM2 is a production-process manager that helps to scale the Node.js up or down,  as well as load balance the instances of the server. It also ensures that the processes  are running constantly, tackling down one of the side effects of the thread model of  Node.js: an uncaught exception kills the thread, which in turn kills your application.  Single-threaded applications and exceptions As you learned before, Node.js applications are run in a single thread. This doesn't  mean that Node.js is not concurrent, it only means that your application runs on a  single thread, but everything else runs parallel. This has an implication: if an exception bubbles out without being handled, your  application dies.  The solution for this is making an intensive use of promises libraries such as  bluebird; it adds handlers for success and failures so that if there is an error,   the exception does not bubble out, killing your app. However, there are some situations that we can't control, we call them unrecoverable  errors or bugs. Eventually, your application will die due to a badly handled error.  In languages such as Java, an exception is not a huge deal: the thread dies, but the  application continues working.  In Node.js, it is a big problem. This problem was solved in the first instance using  task runners such as forever. Both of them are task runners that, when your application exits for some reason,  rerun it again so it ensures the uptime.  Consider the following example:  [ 51 ]   The helloWorld.js application is now handled by forever, which will rerun it if the  application dies. Let's kill it, as shown in the following image:  As you can see, forever has spawned a different process with the 4903 PID. Now, we  issue a kill command  kill -9 4093  and that is the output from forever, as follows:  Although we have killed it, our application was respawned by forever without any  downtime  at least, noticeable downtime .  As you can see, forever is pretty basic: it reruns the application as many times as it   gets killed. There is another package called nodemon, which is one of the most useful tools for  developing Node.js applications. It reloads the application if it detects changes in the  files that it monitors  by default, *.* :  Now, if we modify the helloWorld.js file, we can see how nodemon reloads the  application. This is very interesting in order to avoid the edit reload cycle and speed  up the development.  [ 52 ]   Using PM2 – the industry-standard task  runner Although, forever looks very interesting, PM2 is a more advanced task runner   than forever. With PM2, you can completely manage your application life cycle  without any downtime, as well as scale your application up or down with a   simple command.  PM2 also acts as a load balancer.  Let's consider the following example:  var http = require 'http' ;  var server = http.createServer function  request, response  {   console.log 'called!' ;   response.writeHead 200, {"Content-Type": "text plain"} ;   response.end "Hello World\n" ; } ; server.listen 8000 ; console.log "Server running at http:  127.0.0.1:8000 " ;  This is a fairly simple application. Let's run it using PM2:  pm2 start helloWorld.js  This produces an output similar to the following image:  PM2 has registered an app named helloWorld. This app is running in the fork  mode  that means, PM2 is not acting as a load balancer, it has just forked the app   and the PID of the operating system is 6858.  [ 53 ]   Now, as the following screen suggests, we will run pm2 show 0, which shows the  information relevant to the app with id 0, as shown in the following image:  With two commands, we have managed to run a simple application in a very  sophisticated way.  From now on, PM2 will ensure that your app is always running so that if your  application dies, PM2 will restart it again.  We can also monitor the number of apps PM2 is running:  pm2 monit  [ 54 ]   This shows the following output:  This is the PM2 monitor. In this case, it is a complete overkill as our system is only  composed of one application, which runs in the fork mode.  We can also see the logs executing pm2 logs as shown in the following image:  As you can see, PM2 feels solid. With few commands, we have covered 90% of the  monitoring necessities of our application. However, this is not everything.  [ 55 ]   PM2 also comes with an easy way to reload your applications without downtime:  pm2 reload all  This command ensures that your apps are restarted with zero downtime. PM2 will  queue the incoming requests for you and reprocess them once your app is responsive  again. There is a more fine-grained option where you can specify reloading only  certain apps by specifying the app name:  pm2 reload helloWorld  For those who have been fighting for years with Apache, NGINX, PHP-FPM, and so  on, this will sound very familiar.  Another interesting feature in PM2 is running your application in the cluster mode.  In this mode, PM2 spawns a controller process and as many workers  your app  as  you specify so that you can take the benefit of multicore CPUs with a single-thread  technology such as Node.js.  Before doing this, we need to stop our running application:  pm2 stop all  This will result in the following output:  PM2 remembers the apps that were running, so before rerunning the app in the  cluster mode, we need to inform PM2 to forget about your app, as follows:  pm2 delete all  [ 56 ]   We are ready to run our app in the cluster mode:  pm2 start helloWorld.js -i 3  PM2 is acting as a round-robin between the main process and the three workers so  that they can cope with three requests at the same time. We can also scale down or  up our number of workers:  pm2 scale helloWorld 2  This will result in two processes being run for the same app instead of three:  As you can see, with very little effort, we have managed to configure our app in  order to be production ready.  Now, we can save the status of PM2 so that if we restart the server, and PM2 is  running as a daemon, the apps will automatically start.  PM2 has a code API so that we can write a Node.js program to manage all the steps  that we have been manually doing. It also has a way of configuring your services  with a JSON file. We will discuss this in more depth in Chapter 6, Testing and  Documenting Node.js Microservices, when we study how to use PM2 and Docker to  deploy Node.js applications.  [ 57 ]   Summary In this chapter, you learned the basics of Seneca and PM2 so that we will be able  to build and run a microservices-oriented system in Chapter 4, Writing Your First  Microservice in Node.js, of this book.  We have also demonstrated that a few of the concepts exposed in the previous   chapter are actually helpful in solving real-world problems as well as making   our life very easy.  In the next chapter, we will talk about how to split a monolithic application, a task  for which we will need to know a few of the concepts developed during this chapter.  [ 58 ]   From the Monolith to  Microservices  In my professional life, I have worked in quite a few different companies, mainly in  financial services, and all of the companies that I have worked for follow the same  pattern as shown in the following:  1.  A company is set up by a couple of people with good domain knowledge:   insurance, payments, credit cards, and so on.  2.  The company grows, demanding new business requirements that need to be   satisfied quickly  regulation, big customers demanding silly things, and so  on , which are built in a hurry with little to no planning.  3.  The company experiences another phase of growing, where the business   transactions are clearly defined and poorly modelled by a hard-to-maintain  monolithic software.  4.  The company increases the headcount that drives into growing pains and   loss of efficiency due to restrictions imposed on how the software was built  in the first instance.  This chapter is not only about how to avoid the previous flow  uncontrolled organic  growth , but it is also about how to model a new system using microservices.  This chapter is the soul of this book, as I will try to synthetize my experience in  a few pages, setting up the principles to be followed in Chapter 4, Writing Your  First Microservice in Node.js, where we will be building a full system based on  microservices using the lessons learned in the previous chapters.  [ 59 ]   First, there was the monolith A huge percentage  my estimate is around 90%  of the modern enterprise software is  built following a monolithic approach.  Large software components that run in a single container and have a well-defined  development life cycle, which goes completely against the agile principles, deliver  early and deliver often  https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Release_early,_ release_often , as follows:     Deliver early: The sooner you fail, the easier it is to recover. If you are   working for two years on a software component and then it is released, there  is a huge risk of deviation from the original requirements, which are usually  wrong and change every few days.     Deliver often: Delivering often, the stakeholders are aware of the progress   and can see the changes reflected quickly in the software. Errors can be fixed  in a few days and improvements are identified easily.  Companies build big software components instead of smaller ones that work  together as it is the natural thing to do, as shown in the following:  1.  The developer has a new requirement. 2.  He builds a new method on an existing class on the service layer. 3.  The method is exposed on the API via HTTP, SOAP, or any other protocol.  Now, multiply it by the number of developers in your company, and you will obtain  something called organic growth. Organic growth is a type of uncontrolled and  unplanned growth on software systems under business pressure without an adequate  long-term planning, and it is bad.  How to tackle organic growth? The first thing required to tackle organic growth is to make sure that the business  and IT are aligned in the company. Usually, in big companies, IT is not seen as a   core part of the business.  Organizations outsource their IT systems, keeping the price in mind, but not the  quality so that the partners building these software components are focused on one  thing: deliver on time and according to the specifications even if they are incorrect.  This produces a less-than-ideal ecosystem to respond to the business needs with  a working solution for an existing problem. IT is lead by people who barely  understand how the systems are built, and usually overlook the complexity of  software development.  [ 60 ]   Fortunately, this is a changing tendency as IT systems become the driver of 99% of the  businesses around the world, but we need to get smarter about how we build them.  The first measure to tackle organic growth is aligning IT and business stakeholders to  work together: educating the nontechnical stakeholders is the key to success.  If we go back to the few big releases schema. Can we do it better?  Of course we can. Divide the work into manageable software artifacts that model a  single, well-defined business activity and give it an entity.  It does not need to be a microservice at this stage, but keeping the logic inside of a  separated, well-defined, easily testable, and decoupled module will give us a huge  advantage for future changes in the application.  Let's consider the following example:  In this insurance system, you can see that someone was in a hurry. SMS and e-mail  sender, although both are communication channels, they have a very different nature  and you probably want them to act in different ways.  [ 61 ]   The calling services are grouped into the following two high-level entities:     New Business: The new customers that receive an e-mail when they sign up    Renewals: The existing customers that receive an SMS when the insurance   policy is ready to be renewed  At some point, the system needed to send SMSs and e-mails and someone created  the communication service entity that handles all the third-party communications.  It looks like a good idea in the beginning. SMS or e-mail, at the end of the day, is  only a channel, the communication mechanism will be 90% same and we can reuse  plenty of functionality.  What happens if we suddenly want to integrate a third-party service that handles all  the physical post?  What happens if we want to add a newsletter that goes out to the customers once a  week with information that we consider interesting for our customers?  The service will grow out of control and it will become more difficult to test, release,  and ensure that the changes in the SMS code won't affect sending the e-mail in   any form. This is organic growth and, in this case, it is related to a law called Conway's Law,  which states the following:  Any organization that designs a system  defined more broadly here than just  information systems  will inevitably produce a design whose structure is a   copy of the organization's communication structure.  In this case, we are falling into a trap. We are trying to model the communication on  a single software component that is probably too big and complex to react quickly to  new business needs.  [ 62 ]   Let's take a look at the following diagram:  Now, we have encapsulated every communication channel on its own service   which, later on, will be deployed as a microservice  and we will do the same for  future communication channels.  This is the first step to beat organic growth: create fine-grained services with   well-defined boundaries and a single responsibility—do something small, but do it well.  How abstract is too abstract? Our brain can't handle complicated mechanisms. The abstraction capacity is one of  the most recent human intelligence acquisitions.  In the example from the previous section, I've given something for good, which will  upset half of the programmers in the world: eradicating the abstraction of our system.  [ 63 ]   The abstraction capacity is something that we learn along the years and, unlike  intelligence, it can be trained. Not everyone can reach the same level of abstraction,  and if we mix the specific and complex domain knowledge required by some  industries with a high-level of abstraction, we have the perfect recipe for a disaster.  When building software, one of the golden rules that I always tried to follow    and try is the correct word, as I always find huge opposition to it  is to avoid  premature abstraction.  How many times did you find yourself in a corner with a simple set of requirements:  build a program to solve X. However, your team goes off and anticipates all the  possible variations of X, without even knowing if they are plausible. Then, once the  software is in production, one of the stakeholders comes with a variation of X that  you could have never imagined  as the requirements were not even correct  and  now, getting this variation to work will cost you a few days and a massive refactor. The way to avoid this problem is simple: avoid abstraction without at least three use cases.  Do not factor in the possibility of sending the data through different types of  channels as it might not happen and you are compromising the current feature with  unnecessary abstractions. Once you have at least one other communication channel,  it is time to start thinking about how these two software components can be designed  better, and when the third use case shows up, refactor.  Remember that when building microservices, they should be small enough to be  rewritten on a single sprint  around two weeks , so the benefits of having a working  prototype in such a short period of time is worth the risk of having to rewrite it once  the requirements are more concrete: something to show to the stakeholders is the  quickest way to nail down the requirements. Seneca is great in this regard as, through pattern matching, we can extend the API of  a given microservice without affecting the existing calling code: our service is open  for extension, but closed for modification  the SOLID principles  as we are adding  functionality without affecting the existing one. We will see more complete examples  of this behavior in Chapter 4, Writing Your First Microservice in Node.js.  Then the microservices appeared Microservices are here to stay. Nowadays, the companies give more importance  to the quality of the software. As stated in the previous section, deliver early and  deliver often are the key to succeed in software development.  [ 64 ]   Microservices are helping us to satisfy business needs as quickly as possible through  modularity and specialization. Small pieces of software that can easily be versioned  and upgraded within a few days and they are easy to test as they have a clear and  small purpose  specialization  and are written in such a way that they are isolated  from the rest of the system  modularization .  Unfortunately, it is not common to find the situation as described previously.  Usually, big software systems are not built in a way that modularization or  specialization are easy to identify. The general rule is to build a big software  component that does everything and the modularization is poor, so we need   to start from the very basics.  Let's start by writing some code, as shown in the following:  module.exports = function options  {    var init = {}     **    * Sends one SMS    *    init.sendSMS = function destination, content  {        Code to send SMS   }     **    * Reads the pending list of SMS.    *    init.readPendingSMS = function   {        code to receive SMS     return listOfSms;   }     **    * Sends an email.    *    init.sendEmail = function subject, content  {        code to send emails   }     **    * Gets a list of pending emails.    *    init.readPendingEmails = function   {  [ 65 ]          code to read the pending emails     return listOfEmails;   }     **    * This code marks an email as read so it does not get    * fetch again by the readPendingEmails function.    *    init.markEmailAsRead = function messageId  {        code to mark a message as read.   }     **    * This function queues a document to be printed and    * sent by post.    *    init.queuePost = function document  {        code to queue post   }    return init; }  As you can see, this module can be easily called communications service and it  will be fairly easy to guess what it is doing. It manages the e-mail, SMS, and post  communications.  This is probably too much. This service is deemed to grow out of control, as people  will keep adding methods related to communications. This is the key problem of  monolithic software: the bounded context spans across different areas, affecting the  quality of our software from both functional and maintenance point of view.  If you are a software developer, a red flag will be raised straightaway: the cohesion  of this module is quite poor.  Although it could have worked for a while, we are now changing our mindset. We  are building small, scalable, and autonomous components that can be isolated. The  cohesion in this case is bad as the module is doing too many different things: e-mail,  SMS, and post.  What happens if we add another communication channel such as Twitter and  Facebook notifications?  [ 66 ]   The service grows out of control. Instead of having small functional software  components, you end up with a gigantic module that will be difficult to refactor, test,  and modify. Let's take a look at the following SOLID design principles, explained in  Chapter 2, Microservices in Node.js – Seneca and PM2 Alternatives:     Single-responsibility principle: The module does too many things.    Open for extension, closed for modification: The module will need to be   modified to add new functionalities and probably change the common code.     Liskov Substitution: We will skip this one again.     Interface segregation: We don't have any interface specified in the module,  just the implementation of an arbitrary set of functions.     Dependency injection: There is no dependency injection. The module needs   to be built by the calling code.  Things get more complicated if we don't have tests.  Therefore, let's split it into various small modules using Seneca.  First, the e-mail module  email.js  will be as follows:  module.exports = function  options  {     **    * Sends an email.    *    this.add {channel: 'email', action: 'send'}, function msg,       respond  {        Code to send an email.     respond null, {...} ;   } ;     **    * Gets a list of pending emails.    *    this.add {channel: 'email', action: 'pending'}, function msg,       respond  {        Code to read pending email.     respond null, {...} ;   } ;     **    * Marks a message as read.    *   [ 67 ]     this.add {channel: 'email', action: 'read'}, function msg,       respond  {        Code to mark a message as read.     respond null, {...} ;   } ; }  The SMS module  sms.js  will be as follows:  module.exports = function  options  {     **    * Sends an email.    *    this.add {channel: 'sms', action: 'send'}, function msg,       respond  {        Code to send a sms.     respond null, {...} ;   } ;     **    * Receives the pending SMS.    *    this.add {channel: 'sms', action: 'pending'}, function msg,       respond  {        Code to read pending sms.     respond null, {...} ;   } ; }  Finally, the post module  post.js  will be as follows:  module.exports = function  options  {     **    * Queues a post message for printing and sending.    *    this.add {channel: 'post', action: 'queue'}, function msg,       respond  {        Code to queue a post message.     respond null, {...} ;   } ; }  [ 68 ]   The following diagram shows the new structure of modules:  [ 69 ]   Now, we have three modules. Each one of these modules does one specific thing  without interfering with each other; we have created high-cohesion modules.  Let's run the preceding code, as follows:  var seneca = require "seneca"          .use "email"        .use "sms"        .use "post" ;  seneca.listen {port: 1932, host: "10.0.0.7"} ;  As simple as that, we have created a server with the IP 10.0.0.7 bound that listens  on the 1932 port for incoming requests. As you can see, we haven't referenced any  file, we just referenced the module by name; Seneca will do the rest.  Let's run it and verify that Seneca has loaded the plugins:  node index.js --seneca.log.all  grep DEFINE  This command will output something similar to the following lines:  If you remember from Chapter 2, Microservices in Node.js – Seneca and PM2  Alternatives, Seneca loads a few plugins by default: basic, transport, web, and   mem-store, which allow Seneca to work out of the box without being hassled  with the configuration. Obviously, as we will see in Chapter 4, Writing Your First  Microservice in Node.js, that the configuration is necessary as, for example, mem-store  will only store data in the memory without persisting it between executions.  Aside from the standard plugins, we can see that Seneca has loaded three extra  plugins: email, sms, and post, which are the plugins that we have created.  [ 70 ]   As you can see, the services written in Seneca are quite easy to understand once you  know how the framework works. In this case, I have written the code in the form of  a plugin so that it can be used by different instances of Seneca on different machines,  as Seneca has a transparent transport mechanism that allows us to quickly redeploy  and scale parts of our monolithic app as microservices, as follows:     The new version can be easily tested, as changes on the e-mail functionality   will only affect sending the e-mail. It is easy to scale. As we will see in the next chapter, replicating a service is as  easy as configuring a new server and pointing our Seneca client to it. It is also easy to maintain, as the software is easier to understand and modify.          Disadvantages With microservices, we solve the biggest problems in modern enterprise, but that  does not mean that they are problem free. Microservices often lead to different types  of problems that are not easy to foresee.  The first and most concerning one is the operational overhead that could chew up  the benefits obtained from using microservices. When you are designing a system,  you should always have one question in mind: how to automate this? Automation is  the key to tackling this problem.  The second disadvantage with microservices is nonuniformity on the applications.  A team might consider something a good practice that could be banned in another  team  especially around exception handling , which adds an extra layer of isolation  between teams that probably does not do well for the communication of your  engineers within the team.  Lastly, but not less important, microservices introduce a bigger communication  complexity that could lead to security problems. Instead of having to control a  single application and its communication with the outer world, we are now facing a  number of servers that communicate with each other.  Splitting the monolith Consider that the marketing department of your company has decided to run an  aggressive e-mail campaign that is going to require peaks of capacity that could  harm the normal day-to-day process of sending e-mail. Under stress, the e-mails   will be delayed and that could cause us problems.  Luckily, we have built our system as explained in the previous section. Small Seneca  modules in the form of a high-cohesion and low-coupled plugins.  [ 71 ]   Then, the solution to achieve it is simple: deploy the e-mail service  email.js  on  more than one machine:  var seneca = require "seneca"   .use "email" ; seneca.listen {port: 1932, host: "new-email-service-ip"} ;  Also, create a Seneca client pointing to it, as follows:  var seneca = require "seneca"          .use "email"        .use "sms"        .use "post" ; seneca.listen {port: 1932, host: "10.0.0.7"} ;     interact with the existing email service using "seneca"  var senecaEmail = require "seneca" .client {host: "new-email-    service-ip", port: 1932} ;     interact with the new email service using "senecaEmail"  From now on, the senecaEmail variable will contact the remote service when calling  act and we would have achieved our goal: scale up our first microservice.  Problems splitting the monolith – it is all  about the data Data storage could be problematic. If your application has grown out of control for a  number of years, the database would have done the same, and by now, the organic  growth will make it hard to deal with significant changes in the database.  Microservices should look after their own data. Keeping the data local to the service  is one of the keys to ensure that the system remains flexible as it evolves, but it  might not be always possible. As an example, financial services suffer especially  from one of the main weak points of microservices-oriented architectures: the lack of  transactionality. When a software component deals with money, it needs to ensure  that the data remains consistent and not eventually consistent after every single  operation. If a customer deposits money in a financial company, the software that  holds the account balance needs to be consistent with the money held in the bank,  otherwise, the reconciliation of the accounts will fail. Not only that, if your company  is a regulated entity, it could cause serious problems for the continuity of the business.  [ 72 ]   The general rule of thumb, when working with microservices and financial  systems, is to keep a not-so-microservice that deals with all the money and creates  microservices for the auxiliary modules of the system such as e-mailing, SMS, user  registration, and so on, as shown in the following image:  As you can see in the preceding picture, the fact that payments will be a big  microservice instead of smaller services, it only has implications in the operational  side, there is nothing preventing us from modularizing the application as seen  before. The fact that withdrawing money from an ATM has to be an atomic operation   either succeed or fail without intermediate status  should not dictate how we  organize the code in our application, allowing us to modularize the services, but  spanning the transaction scope across all of them.  Organizational alignment In a company where the software is built based on microservices, every single  stakeholder needs to be involved in decision making.  Microservices are a huge paradigm shift. Usually, large organizations tend to build  software in a very old fashioned manner. Big releases every few months that require  days to complete the quality assurance  QA  phase and few hours to deploy.  [ 73 ]   When a company chooses to implement a microservices-oriented architecture, the  methodology changes completely: small teams work on small features that are  built, tested, and deployed on their own. The teams do one thing  one microservice,  or more realistic, a few of them  and they do it well  they master the domain and  technical knowledge required to build the software .  These are what usually called cross-functional teams. A unit of work of few people  that have the required knowledge to build high-quality software components.  It is also important to flag that the team has to master the domain knowledge needed  to understand the business requirements.  Here is where the majority of the companies where I have worked in my professional  life fail  in my opinion . Developers are considered brick stackers that magically  understand the business flows without being exposed to them before. If one  developer delivers X amount of work in one week, ten developers will deliver 10X.  This is wrong.  People in cross-functional teams that build the microservices have to master  not  only know  the domain-specific knowledge in order to be efficient and factor the  Conway's Law and its implications into the system for changing how the business  processes work.  When talking about organizational alignment in microservices, autonomy is the  key. The teams need to be autonomous in order to be agile while building the  microservices, which implies keeping the technical authority within the team,   as follows:     Languages used    Code standards    Patterns used to solve problems    Tools chosen to build, test, debug, and deploy the software  This is an important part, as this is where we need to define how the company builds  software and where the engineering problems may be introduced.  As an example, we can look into the coding standards, as shown in the following list:     Do we want to keep the same coding standards across the teams?    Do we want each team to have their own coding standards?  [ 74 ]   In general, I am always in favor of the 80% rule: 80% of perfection is more than enough  for 100% of the use cases. It means that loosening up the coding standards  it can be  applied to other areas  and allowing some level of imperfection personalization,  helps to reduce the friction between teams and also allows the engineers to quickly  catch up with the very few important rules to follow such as logging strategies or  exception handling.  If your coding standards are too complicated, there will be friction when a team tries  to push a code into a microservice out of their usual scope  remember, teams own the  services, but every team can contribute to them .  Summary In this chapter, we discussed the principles of building monolithic applications  oriented to be split as microservices, depending on the business needs. As you have  learned, the Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability  ACID  design principles  are concepts that we need to have in mind in order to build high quality software.  You have also learned that we cannot assume that we are going to be able to design  a system from scratch, so we need to be smart about how we build the new parts  of the system and how we refactor the existing ones so that we achieve the level of  flexibility required to satisfy the business needs and be resilient.  We also have given a small introduction about monolithic designed databases and  how they are the biggest pain points when splitting a monolithic software into  microservices, as it is usually required to shut down the system for a few hours in  order to split the data into local databases. This subject could well be an entire book  as new trends with NoSQL databases are changing the game of data storage.  Finally, we discussed how to align the teams of engineers in our company in order to  be efficient while keeping the flexibility and resilience needed to be able to be agile,  as well as how the Conway's Law impacts the conversion of monolithic systems into  microservices-oriented architectures.  In the next chapter, we will apply all the principles discussed in the first three  chapters, as well as a big dose of common sense to build a full working system   based on microservices.  [ 75 ]    Writing Your First  Microservice in Node.js  We have been learning about how to build robust microservices-oriented software,  and now it is time to put all the concepts to practice. In this chapter, we are going to  build a microservices-oriented e-commerce using Seneca and some other frameworks  that are going to allow us to write a software that will benefit from the particularities  of the microservices.  Micromerce – the big picture It covers the following:     Writing microservices    Sizing microservices    Creating APIs       Storing data using Seneca  Integrating Seneca with Express  In this chapter, we are going to write a full  nearly  simplistic e-commerce solution  based on microservices. Full means full from the conceptual point of view, but for  obvious reasons, it won't be full  as production ready  as it could take us a few books  to handle all the possible flows.  We won't go deep in to the UI, as it is not related to the subject of this book. What  we will do instead is a microservice that will aggregate all the other microservices,  creating a frontend API to be consumed by a Single-Page Application  SPA , built  with any of the modern JavaScript frameworks.  [ 77 ]   In this chapter, we are going to develop the following four microservices:     Product Manager: This microservice will be responsible for adding, editing,  and removing products from our database, as well as serving products to the  customers. This microservice will be partially public for a potential admin  site to add remove products.     Order Manager: This microservice will be responsible for managing the      Emailer: This microservice will be responsible for delivering e-mails to    order and billing.  the customers.     UI: This microservice will expose the feature from the other microservices to   a potential SPA, but we will only build the JSON interface.  Building the four preceding microservices, we will develop the concepts discussed  in the previous chapters so that, by the end of this chapter, we will be able to identify  the most common pitfalls going forward. Keep in mind that the objective of this book  is not converting you into a microservices or Node.js expert, but to give you the tools  required to learn by yourself, as well as make you aware of the best design principles  and the most common pitfalls.  Let's take a look at the deployment diagram:  [ 78 ]   This diagram shows how our company  the yellow square  hides some of our  microservices from the real world and exposes some others to different networks,   as follows:     UI will be exposed to the Internet. Everybody will be able to hit this endpoint.    Product Management will manage the products in our e-commerce. It will   have the following two interfaces:     A Seneca endpoint from where the UI will extract data    A JSON API from where the office of our company will be able to   create, update, and delete products     Emailer will be our communication channel with our customers. We will   use this microservice to explain the good points of Seneca, and we will also  give an example of the eventual consistency and system degradation when a  microservice fails.     Order Manager: This microservice will let us handle the orders for our   customers. With this microservice, we will discuss how to handle the fact  that the data is local to each microservice, instead of being global to the  system. You can't just go to the database to recover the product name or  price, it needs to be recovered from other microservice.  As you can see, there is no user or staff management, but with these  four microservices, we will be able to develop the core concepts of  microservices architectures. Seneca comes with a very powerful data  and transport plugin system that makes it easy to use Seneca with  different data storages and transport systems.  For all our microservices, we are going to use MongoDB as the storage. Seneca comes  with an out-of-the-box in-memory database plugin that allows you to start coding  straightaway, but the storage is transient: it does not persist the data between calls.  Product Manager – the two-faced core Product Manager is the core of our system. I know what you are thinking:  microservices should be small  micro  and distributed  no central point , but you  need to set the conceptual centre somewhere, otherwise you will end up with a  fragmented system and traceability problems  we will talk about it later .  [ 79 ]   Building a dual API with Seneca is fairly easy, as it comes with a quite  straightforward integration with Express. Express is going to be used to expose some  capabilities of the UI such as editing products, adding products, deleting products,  and so on. It is a very convenient framework, easy to learn, and it integrates well  with Seneca. It is also a de-facto standard on Node.js for web apps, so it makes it easy  to find information about the possible problems.  It is going to also have a private part exposed through Seneca TCP  the default  plugin in Seneca  so that our internal network of microservices  specifically, the UI   will be able to access the list of products in our catalogue.  Product Manager is going to be small and cohesioned  it will only manage products ,  as well as scalable, but it will hold all the knowledge required to deal with products  in our e-commerce.  First thing we need to do is to define our Product Manager microservice, as follows:     This is going to have a function to retrieve all the products in the database.   This is probably a bad idea in a production system  as it probably would  require pagination , but it works for our example.     This should have one function that fetches all the products for a given   category. It is similar to the previous one, it would need pagination in a  production-ready system.     This should have a function to retrieve products by identifier  id .    This should have one function that allows us to add products to the    database  in this case MongoDB . This function will use the Seneca data  abstraction to decouple our microservice from the storage: we will be able   to  in theory  switch Mongo to a different database without too much hassle   in theory again .     This should have one function to remove products. Again, using Seneca    data abstraction.     This should have one function to edit products.  Our product will be a data structure having four fields: name, category, description,  and price. As you can see, it is a bit simplistic, but it will help us to understand the  complicated world of microservices.  Our Product Management microservice is going to use MongoDB  https:  www. mongodb.org  . Mongo is a document-oriented schema-less database that allows an  enormous flexibility to store data such as products  that, at the end of the day, are  documents . It is also a good choice for Node.js as it stores JSON objects, which is a  standard, created for JavaScript  JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation , so  that looks like the perfect pairing.  [ 80 ]   There is a lot of useful information on the MongoDB website if you want to learn  more about it.  Let's start coding our functions.  Fetching products To fetch products, we go to the database and dump the full list of products straight  to the interface. In this case, we won't create any pagination mechanism, but in  general, paginating data is a good practice to avoid database  or applications, but  mainly database  performance problems.  Let's see the following code:   **  * Fetch the list of all the products.  *  seneca.add {area: "product", action: "fetch"}, function args,     done  {   var products = this.make "products" ;   products.list$ {}, done ; } ;  We already have a pattern in Seneca that returns all the data in our database.  The products.list$   function will receive the following two parameters:     The query criteria    A function that receives an error and result object  remember the error-first   callback approach   Seneca uses the $ symbol to identify the key functions such as list$, save$, and  so on. Regarding the naming of the properties of your objects, as long as you use  alphanumeric identifiers, your naming will be collision free.  We are passing the done function from the seneca.add   method to the list$  method. This works as Seneca follows the callback with error-first approach. In   other words, we are creating a shortcut for the following code:  seneca.add {area: "product", action: "fetch"}, function args,     done  {   var products = this.make "products" ;   products.list$ {}, function err, result  {     done err, result ;   } ; } ;  [ 81 ]   Fetching by category Fetching by category is very similar to fetching the full list of products. The only  difference is that now the Seneca action will take a parameter to filter the products   by category.  Let's see the code:   **  * Fetch the list of products by category.  *  seneca.add {area: "product", action: "fetch", criteria:     "byCategory"}, function args, done  {   var products = this.make "products" ;   products.list$ {category: args.category}, done ; } ;  One of the first questions that most advanced developers will now have in their  mind is that isn't this a perfect scenario for an injection attack? Well, Seneca is smart  enough to prevent it, so we don't need to worry about it any more than avoid  concatenating strings with user input.  As you can see, the only significant difference is the parameter passed called  category, which gets delegated into Seneca data abstraction layer that will generate  the appropriate query, depending on the storage we use. This is extremely powerful  when talking about microservices. If you remember, in the previous chapters, we  always talked about coupling as if it was the root of all evils, and now we can assure  it is, and Seneca handles it in a very elegant way. In this case, the framework provides  a contract that the different storage plugins have to satisfy in order to work. In the  preceding example, list$ is part of this contract. If you use the Seneca storage wisely,  switching your microservice over to a new database engine  have you ever been  tempted to move a part of your data over MongoDB?  is a matter of configuration.  Fetching by ID Fetching a product by ID is one of the most necessary methods, and it is also a tricky  one. Not tricky from the coding point of view, as shown in the following:   **  * Fetch a product by id.  *  seneca.add {area: "product", action: "fetch", criteria: "byId"},     function args, done  {   var product = this.make "products" ;   product.load$ args.id, done ; } ;  [ 82 ]   The tricky part is how id is generated. The generation of id is one of the contact  points with the database. Mongo creates a hash to represent a synthetic ID; whereas,  MySQL usually creates an integer that auto-increments to uniquely identify each  record. Given that, if we want to switch MongoDB to MySQL in one of our apps,  the first problem that we need to solve is how to map a hash that looks something  similar to the following into an ordinal number:  e777d434a849760a1303b7f9f989e33a  In 99% of the cases, this is fine, but we need to be careful, especially when storing  IDs as, if you recall from the previous chapters, the data should be local to each  microservice, which could imply that changing the data type of the ID of one entity,  requires changing the referenced ID in all the other databases.  Adding a product Adding a product is trivial. We just need to create the data and save it in the database:   **  * Adds a product.  *  seneca.add {area: "product", action: "add"}, function args, done  {   var products = this.make "products" ;   products.category = args.category;   products.name = args.name;   products.description = args.description;   products.category = args.category;   products.price = args.price   products.save$ function err, product  {     done err, products.data$ false  ;   } ; } ;  In this method, we are using a helper from Seneca, products.data$ false . This  helper will allow us to retrieve the data of the entity without all the metadata about  namespace  zone , entity name, and base name that we are not interested in when  the data is returned to the calling method.  [ 83 ]   Removing a product The removal of a product is usually done by id: We target the specific data that we  want to remove by the primary key and then remove it, as follows:   **  * Removes a product by id.  *  seneca.add {area: "product", action: "remove"}, function args,     done  {   var product = this.make "products" ;   product.remove$ args.id, function err  {   done err, null ;   } ; } ;  In this case, we don't return anything aside from an error if something goes wrong,  so the endpoint that calls this action can assume that a non-errored response is   a success.  Editing a product We need to provide an action to edit products. The code for doing that is as follows:   **  * Edits a product fetching it by id first.  *  seneca.edit {area: "product", action: "edit"}, function args,     done  {   seneca.act {area: "product", action: "fetch", criteria: "byId",     id: args.id}, function err, result  {   result.data$    {     name: args.name,      category: args.category,      description: args.description,     price: args.price    }    ;   result.save$ function err, product {     done product.data$ false  ;     } ;   } ; } ;  [ 84 ]   Here is an interesting scenario. Before editing a product, we need to fetch it by ID,  and we have already done that. So, what we are doing here is relying on the already  existing action to retrieve a product by ID, copying the data across, and saving it.  This is a nice way for code reuse introduced by Seneca, where you can delegate a call  from one action to another and work in the wrapper action with the result.  Wiring everything up As we agreed earlier, the product manager is going to have two faces: one that will  be exposed to other microservices using the Seneca transport over TCP and a second  one exposed through Express  a Node.js library to create web apps  in the REST way.  Let's wire everything together:  var plugin = function options  {   var seneca = this;       **    * Fetch the list of all the products.    *    seneca.add {area: "product", action: "fetch"}, function args,       done  {     var products = this.make "products" ;     products.list$ {}, done ;   } ;       **    * Fetch the list of products by category.    *    seneca.add {area: "product", action: "fetch", criteria:       "byCategory"}, function args, done  {     var products = this.make "products" ;     products.list$ {category: args.category}, done ;   } ;       **    * Fetch a product by id.    *    seneca.add {area: "product", action: "fetch", criteria: "byId"},       function args, done  {     var product = this.make "products" ;  [ 85 ]       product.load$ args.id, done ;   } ;       **    * Adds a product.    *    seneca.add {area: "product", action: "add"}, function args,       done  {     var products = this.make "products" ;     products.category = args.category;     products.name = args.name;     products.description = args.description;     products.category = args.category;     products.price = args.price     products.save$ function err, product  {       done err, products.data$ false  ;     } ;   } ;       **    * Removes a product by id.    *    seneca.add {area: "product", action: "remove"}, function args,       done  {     var product = this.make "products" ;     product.remove$ args.id, function err  {       done err, null ;     } ;   } ;       **    * Edits a product fetching it by id first.    *    seneca.add {area: "product", action: "edit"}, function args,       done  {     seneca.act {area: "product", action: "fetch", criteria:         "byId", id: args.id}, function err, result  {       result.data$          {           name: args.name,            category: args.category,            description: args.description,           price: args.price                     }        ;  [ 86 ]         result.save$ function err, product {         done err, product.data$ false  ;       } ;     } ;   } ; } module.exports = plugin;  var seneca = require "seneca"   ; seneca.use plugin ; seneca.use "mongo-store", {   name: "seneca",   host: "127.0.0.1",   port: "27017" } ;  seneca.ready function err {      seneca.act 'role:web',{use:{     prefix: ' products',     pin: {area:'product',action:'*'},     map:{     fetch: {GET:true},     edit: {GET:false,POST:true},     delete: {GET: false, DELETE: true}     }   }} ;   var express = require 'express' ;   var app = express  ;   app.use require "body-parser" .json   ;         This is how you integrate Seneca with Express   app.use  seneca.export 'web'   ;    app.listen 3000 ;  } ;  Now let's explain the code:  We have created a Seneca plugin. This plugin can be reused across different  microservices. This plugin contains all the definitions of methods needed by   our microservice that we have previously described.  [ 87 ]   The preceding code describes the following two sections:     The first few lines connect to Mongo. In this case, we are specifying that  Mongo is a local database. We are doing that through the use of a plugin  called mongo-store—https:  github.com rjrodger seneca-mongo- store, written by Richard Rodger, the author of Seneca.     The second part is new to us. It might sound familiar if you have used   JQuery before, but basically what the seneca.ready   callback is doing is  taking care of the fact that Seneca might not have connected to Mongo before  the calls start flowing into its API. The seneca.ready   callback is where the  code for integrating Express with Seneca lives.  The following is the package.json configuration of our app:  {   "name": "Product Manager",   "version": "1.0.0",   "description": "Product Management sub-system",   "main": "index.js",   "keywords": [     "microservices",     "products"   ],   "author": "David Gonzalez",   "license": "ISC",   "dependencies": {   "body-parser": "^1.14.1",   "debug": "^2.2.0",   "express": "^4.13.3",   "seneca": "^0.8.0",   "seneca-mongo-store": "^0.2.0",   "type-is": "^1.6.10"   } }  Here we control all the libraries needed for our microservice to run, as well as   the configuration.  [ 88 ]   Integrating with Express – how to create a  REST API Integrating with Express is quite straightforward. Let's take a look at the code:    seneca.act 'role:web',{use:{     prefix: ' products',     pin: {area:'product',action:'*'},     map:{     fetch: {GET:true},           edit: {PUT:true},     delete: {GET: false, DELETE: true}     }   }} ;   var express = require 'express' ;   var app = express  ;   app.use require "body-parser" .json   ;         This is how you integrate Seneca with Express   app.use  seneca.export 'web'   ;    app.listen 3000 ;  This code snippet, as we've seen in the preceding section, provides the following  three REST endpoints:   products fetch   products edit   products delete  Let's explain how.  First, what we do is tell Seneca to execute the role:web action, indicating the  configuration. This configuration specifies to use a  products prefix for all the URLs,  and it pins the action with a matching {area: "product", action: "*"} pattern.  This is also new for us, but it is a nice way to specify to Seneca that whatever action  it executes in the URL, it will have implicit area: "product" of the handler. This  means that  products fetch endpoint will correspond to the {area: 'products',  action: 'fetch'} pattern. This could be a bit difficult, but once you get used to it,  it is actually really powerful. It does not force use to fully couple our actions with  our URLs by conventions.  [ 89 ]   In the configuration, the attribute map specifies the HTTP actions that can be  executed over an endpoint: fetch will allow GET, edit will allow PUT, and delete   will only allow DELETE. This way, we can control the semantics of the application.  Everything else is probably familiar to you. Create an Express app and specify using  the following two plugins:     The JSON body parser    The Seneca web plugin  This is all. Now, if we add a new action to our Seneca list of actions in order to  expose it through the API, the only thing that needs to be done is to modify the   map attribute to allow HTTP methods.  Although we have built a very simplistic microservice, it captures a big portion of the  common patterns that you find when creating a CRUD  Create Read Update Delete   application. We have also created a small REST API out of a Seneca application with  little to no effort. All we need to do now is configure the infrastructure  MongoDB   and we are ready to deploy our microservice.  The e-mailer – a common problem E-mailing is something that every company needs to do. We need to communicate  with our customers in order to send notifications, bills, or registration e-mails.  In the companies where I've worked before, e-mailing always presented a problem  such as e-mails not being delivered, or being delivered twice, with the wrong content  to the wrong customer, and so on. It looks terrifying that something as simple as  sending an e-mail could be this complicated to manage.  In general, e-mail communication is the first candidate to write a microservice. Think  about it:     E-mail does one thing    E-mail does it well    E-mail keeps its own data  It is also a good example of how the Conway's law kicks into our systems without  being noticed. We design our systems modeling the existing communication in our  company as we are constrained by it.  [ 90 ]   How to send e-mails Back to the basics. How do we send e-mails? I am not talking about which network  protocol we use for sending the e-mail or what are the minimum acceptable headers?  I am talking about what we need to send an e-mail from the business point of view:     A title    The content    A destination address  That is everything. We could have gone far, talking about acknowledgements,   secure e-mail, BCCs, and so on. However, we are following the lean methodology:  start with the minimum viable product and build up from it until you achieve the  desired result.  I can't remember a project where the e-mail sending wasn't a controversial part. The  product chosen to deliver e-mails ends up tightly coupled to the system and it is  really hard to replace it seamlessly. However, microservices are here to rescue us.  Defining the interface As I mentioned before, although it sounds easy, sending corporate e-mails could  end up being a mess. Therefore, the first thing we need to clear is our minimum  requirements:     How do we render the e-mail?     Does rendering the email belongs to the bound context of the    email manipulation?     Do we create another microservice to render e-mails?    Do we use a third party to manage the e-mails?     Do we store the already sent e-mails for auditing purposes?  For this microservice, we are going to use Mandrill. Mandrill is a company that  allows us to send corporate e-mails, track the already sent e-mails, and create e-mail  templates that can be edited online.  Our microservice is going to look as shown in the following code:  var plugin = function options  {   var seneca = this;    **  [ 91 ]      * Sends an email using a template email.    *    seneca.add {area: "email", action: "send", template: "*"},       function args, done  {    TODO: More code to come.   } ;       **    * Sends an email including the content.    *    seneca.add {area: "email", action: "send"}, function args, done  {    TODO: More code to come.   } ; };  We have two patterns: one that makes use of templates and the other that sends the  content contained in the request.  As you can see, everything that we have defined here is information related to  e-mailing. There is no bleeding from the Mandrill terminology into what the other  microservices see in our e-mail sending. The only compromise that we are making is  the templating. We are delegating the template rendering to the e-mail sender, but it  is not a big deal, as even if we walk away from Mandrill, we will need to render the  content somehow.  We will come back to the code later.  Setting up Mandrill Mandrill is fairly easy to use and shouldn't be a problem to set up. However, we are  going to use the test mode so that we can assure that the e-mails are not going to be  delivered and we can access the API for all our needs.  The first thing we need to do is create an account on Mandrill. Just register with   your e-mail at https:  mandrillapp.com, and you should be able to access to it,   as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 92 ]   Now we have created an account that we need to enter into the test mode. In order to  do it, just click on your e-mail at the top-right corner and select the Turn on the test  mode option from the menu. The Mandrill menu on the left will turn orange now. Next, we need to create an API key. This key is the login information to be used  by the Mandrill API. Just click on Settings and SMTP & API Info and add a new  key  don't forget the checkbox to mark the key as test key . It should look like the  following screenshot now:  [ 93 ]   The key is everything you need for now. Let's test the API:  var mandrill = require "mandrill-api mandrill" ; var mandrillClient = new mandrill.Mandrill " " ;  mandrillClient.users.info {}, function result {   console.log result ; }, function e {   console.log e ; } ;  With these few lines, we have managed to test that Mandrill is up and running and  we have a valid key. The output of this program should be something very similar to  the following JSON:  Hands on – integrating Mandrill in your  microservice Everything is ready now. We have a working key and our interface. The only thing  left is to create the code. We are going to use a small part of the Mandrill API, but  if you want to make use of other features, you can find a better description here:  https:  mandrillapp.com api docs   Let's take a look at the following code:   **    * Sends an email including the content.    *   [ 94 ]     seneca.add {area: "email", action: "send"}, function args, done        {     console.log args ;     var message = {       "html": args.content,       "subject": args.subject,       "to": [{         "email": args.to,         "name": args.toName,         "type": "to"       }],       "from_email": "info@micromerce.com",       "from_name": "Micromerce"     }     mandrillClient.messages.send {"message": message},         function result  {       done null, {status: result.status} ;     }, function e  {       done {code: e.name}, null ;     } ;   } ;  This first method sends messages without using a template. We just get the HTML  content  and a few other parameters  from our application and deliver it through  Mandrill.  As you can see, we only have two contact points with the outer world: the  parameters passed in and the return of our actions. Both of them have a clear  contract that has nothing to do with Mandrill, but what about the data?  At the error, we are returning e.name, assuming that it is a code. At some point,  someone will end up branching the flow depending on this error code. Here, we  have something called data coupling; our software components don't depend on the  contract, but they do depend on the content sent across. Now, the question is: how do we fix it? We can't. At least not in an easy way. We  need to assume that our microservice is not perfect, it has a flaw. If we switch  provider for e-mailing, we are going to need to revisit the calling code to check  potential couplings.  [ 95 ]   In the world of software, in every single project that I've worked on before, there  was always a big push trying to make the code as generic as possible, trying to guess  the future, which usually could be as bad as assuming that your microservice won't  be perfect. There is something that always attracted my attention: we put a large  amount of effort in to perfection, but we pretty much ignore the fact that we are  going to fail and we do can nothing about it. Software fails often and we need to be  prepared for that. Later, we will see a pattern to factor human nature into the microservices: the circuit  breaker. Don't be surprised if Mandrill rejects the e-mails due to the unsigned reason. This is  due to the fact that they couldn't validate the domain from where we are sending  the e-mail  in this case, a dummy domain that does not exist . If we want Mandrill to  actually process the e-mails  even though we are in test mode , we just need to verify  our domain by adding some configuration to it.  More information can be found in the Mandrill documentation here: https:  mandrillapp.com api docs   The second method to send e-mails is send an e-mail from a template. In this case,  Mandrill provides a flexible API:             It provides per-recipient variables in case we send the e-mail to a list   of customers It has global variables It allows content replacement  we can replace a full section   For convenience, we are going to just use global variables as we are limited on space  in this book.  Let's take a look at the following code:     **    * Sends an email using a template email.    *    seneca.add {area: "email", action: "send", template: "*"},       function args, done  {     console.log "sending" ;     var message = {       "subject": args.subject,       "to": [{         "email": args.to,  [ 96 ]           "name": args.toName,         "type": "to"       }],       "from_email": "info@micromerce.com",       "from_name": "Micromerce",       "global_merge_vars": args.vars,     }     mandrillClient.messages.sendTemplate        {"template_name": args.template, "template_content": {},           "message": message},      function result  {       done null, {status: result.status} ;     }, function e  {       done {code: e.name}, null ;     } ;   } ;  Now we can create our templates in Mandrill  and let someone else to manage  them  and we are able to use them to send e-mails. Again, we are specializing. Our  system specializes in sending e-mails and you leave the creation of the e-mails to  someone else  maybe someone from the marketing team who knows how to talk to  customers .  Let's analyze this microservice:  design point of view, it is  and does it well     Data is stored locally: Not really  it is stored in Mandrill , but from the      Our microservice is well cohesioned: It sends only e-mails; it does one thing,      The size of the microservice is correct: It can be understood in a few minutes,   it does not have unnecessary abstractions and can be rewritten fairly easily  When we talked about the SOLID design principles earlier, we always skipped L,  which stands for Liskov Substitution. Basically, this means that the software has  to be semantically correct. For example, if we write an object-oriented program that  handles one abstract class, the program has to be able to handle all the subclasses.  Coming back to Node.js, if our service is able to handle sending a plain e-mail, it  should be easy to extend and add capabilities without modifying the existing ones.  Think about it from the day-to-day production operations point of view; if a new  feature is added to your system, the last thing you want to do is retest the existing  functionalities or even worse, deliver the feature to production, introducing a bug  that no one was aware of.  [ 97 ]   Let's create a use case. We want to send the same e-mail to two recipients. Although  Mandrill API allows the calling code to do it, we haven't factored in a potential CC.  Therefore, we are going to add a new action in Seneca that allows us to do it,   as follows:     **    * Sends an email including the content.    *    seneca.add {area: "email", action: "send", cc: "*"},       function args, done  {     var message = {       "html": args.content,       "subject": args.subject,       "to": [{         "email": args.to,         "name": args.toName,         "type": "to"       },{         "email": args.cc,         "name": args.ccName,         "type": "cc"       }],       "from_email": "info@micromerce.com",       "from_name": "Micromerce"     }     mandrillClient.messages.send {"message": message},         function result  {       done null, {status: result.status} ;     }, function e  {       done {code: e.name}, null ;     } ;   } ;  We have instructed Seneca to take the calls that include cc in the list of parameters  and send them using a Mandrill CC in the send API. If we want to use it, the  following signature of the calling code will change:  seneca.act {area: "email", action: "send", subject: "The Subject", to:  "test@test.com", toName: "Test Testingtong"}, function err, result {    More code here } ;  [ 98 ]   The signature will change to the following code:  seneca.act {area: "email", action: "send", subject: "The Subject",  to: "test@test.com", toName: "Test Testingtong", cc: "test2@test.com",  ccName: "Test 2"}, function err, result {    More code here } ;  If you remember correctly, the pattern matching tries to match the most concrete  input so that if an action matches with more parameters than another one, the call  will be directed to it. Here is where Seneca shines: We can call it polymorphism of actions, as we   can define different versions of the same action with different parameters that   end up doing slightly different things and enabling us to reutilize the code if we   are 100% sure that this is the right thing to do  remember, microservices enforce   the share-nothing approach: repeating the code might not be as bad as coupling   two actions .  Here is the package.json for the e-mailer microservice:  {   "name": "emailing",   "version": "1.0.0",   "description": "Emailing sub-system",   "main": "index.js",   "keywords": [   "microservices",   "emailing"   ],   "author": "David Gonzalez",   "license": "ISC",   "dependencies": {   "mandrill-api": "^1.0.45",   "seneca": "^0.8.0"   } }  The fallback strategy When you design a system, usually we think about replaceability of the existing  components; for example, when using a persistence technology in Java, we tend to  lean towards standards  JPA  so that we can replace the underlying implementation  without too much effort.  [ 99 ]   Microservices take the same approach, but they isolate the problem instead of  working towards an easy replaceability. If you read the preceding code, inside the  Seneca actions, we have done nothing to hide the fact that we are using Mandrill to  send the e-mails.  As I mentioned before, e-mailing is something that, although seems simple, always  ends up giving problems.  Imagine that we want to replace Mandrill for a plain SMTP server such as Gmail. We  don't need to do anything special, we just change the implementation and roll out  the new version of our microservice.  The process is as simple as applying the following code:  var nodemailer = require 'nodemailer' ; var seneca = require "seneca"   ; var transporter = nodemailer.createTransport {   service: 'Gmail',   auth: {     user: 'info@micromerce.com',     pass: 'verysecurepassword'   } } ;   **  * Sends an email including the content.  *  seneca.add {area: "email", action: "send"}, function args, done  {   var mailOptions = {     from: 'Micromerce Info  ',     to: args.to,      subject: args.subject,     html: args.body   };   transporter.sendMail mailOptions, function error, info {     if error {       done {code: e}, null ;     }     done null, {status: "sent"} ;   } ; } ;  [ 100 ]   For the outer world, our simplest version of the e-mail sender is now using SMTP  through Gmail to deliver our e-mails.  As we will see later in the book, delivering a new version of the same interface  in a microservice network is fairly easy; as long as we respect the interface, the  implementation should be irrelevant.  We could even roll out one server with this new version and send some traffic to it  in order to validate our implementation without affecting all the customers  in other  words, contain the failure .  We have seen how to write an e-mail sender in this section. We have worked  through a few examples on how our microservice can be adapted quickly for new  requirements as soon as the business requires new capabilities or we decide that our  vendor is not good enough to cope with our technical requirements.  The order manager The order manager is a microservice that processes the orders that the customer  places through the UI. As you probably remember, we are not going to create a  sophisticated single-page application with a modern visual framework, as it is out of  the scope of this book, but we are going to provide the JSON interface in order to be  able to build the front end later.  Order manager introduces an interesting problem: this microservice needs access  to the information about products, such as name, price, availability, and so on.  However, it is stored in the product manager microservice, so how do we do that?  Well, the answer for this question might look simple, but requires a bit of thinking.  Defining the microservice – how to gather  non-local data Our microservice will need to do the following three things:     Recover orders    Create orders    Delete existing orders  [ 101 ]   When recovering an order, the option is going to be simple. Recover the order by  the primary key. We could extend it to recover orders by different criteria, such as  price, date, and so on, but we are going to keep it simple as we want to focus on  microservices.  When deleting existing orders, the option is also clear: use the ID to delete orders.  Again, we could choose a more advanced deletion criteria, but we want to keep   it simple.  The problem arises when we are trying to create orders. Creating an order in our  small microservice architecture means sending an e-mail to the customer, specifying  that we are processing their order, along with the details of the order, as follows:     Number of products    Price per product    Total price    Order ID  in case the customer needs to troubleshoot problems with    the order   How do we recover the product details? If you see our diagram shown in the Micromerce – the big picture section of this  chapter, order manager will only be called from the UI, which will be responsible  to recover the product name, its price, and so on. We could adopt the following two  strategies here:     Order manager calls product manager and gets the details    UI calls product manager and delegates the data to the order manager  Both options are totally valid, but in this case, we are going for the second: UI will  gather the information needed to generate an order and it will only call the order  manager when all the data required is available.  Now to answer the question: why?  [ 102 ]   A simple reason: failure tolerance. Let's take a look at the following sequence  diagram of the two options:  [ 103 ]   The diagram for the second option is shown as follows:  In the first view, there is a big difference: the depth of the call; whereas in the first  example, we have two levels of depth  UI calls the order manager, which calls the  product manager . In the second example, we have only one level of depth. There are  a few immediate effects in our architecture, as follows:     When something goes wrong, if we only have one level of depth, we don't   need to check in too many places.     We are more resilient. If something goes wrong, it is the UI of the   microservice that notices it, returning the appropriate HTTP code, in this  case, without having to translate the errors that occurred a few levels above  the client-facing microservice. It is easier to deploy and test. Not much easier, but we don't need to juggle  around, we can see straight away if the product manager is reached from the  UI, instead of having to go through the order manager.      [ 104 ]   The fact that we are using this architecture instead of the two-level depth does  not mean that it isn't appropriate for another situation: the network topology is  something that you need to plan ahead if you are creating a microservices-oriented  architecture, as it is one of the hardest aspects to change.  In some cases, if we want to be extremely flexible, we can use a messaging queue  with publisher subscriber technology where our microservices can subscribe to  different types of messages and emit others to be consumed by a different service,  but it could complicate the infrastructure that we need to put in place to avoid single  point of failures.  The order manager – the code Let's take a look at the code for the order manager:  var plugin = function options  {   var seneca = this;      seneca.add {area: "orders", action: "fetch"}, function args,       done  {     var orders = this.make "orders" ;     orders.list$ {id: args.id}, done ;   } ;      seneca.add {area: "orders", action: "delete"}, function args,       done  {     var orders = this.make "orders" ;     orders.remove$ {id: args.id}, function err  {         done err, null ;     } ;   } ; } module.exports = plugin;  As you can see, there is nothing complicated about the code. The only interesting  point is the missing code from the create action.  Calling remote services Until now, we have assumed that all our microservices run in the same machine, but  that is far from ideal. In the real world, microservices are distributed and we need to  use some sort of transport protocol to carry the message from one service to another.  Seneca, as well as nearForm, the company behind Seneca, has sorted this problem for  us and the open source community around it.  [ 105 ]   As a modular system, Seneca has embedded the concept of plugin. By default,  Seneca comes with a bundled plugin to use TCP as the protocol, but it is not hard to  create a new transport plugin.  While writing this book, I created one by myself: https:  github. com dgonzalez seneca-nservicebus-transport   With this plugin, we could route the Seneca messages through NServiceBus    a .NET-based Enterprise Bus , changing the configuration of our client and server.  Let's see how to configure Seneca to point to a different machine:  var senecaEmailer = require "seneca"   .client {host: "192.168.0.2",  port: 8080} ;  By default, Seneca will use the default plugin for transport, which as we've seen in  Chapter 2, Microservices in Node.js – Seneca and PM2 Alternatives, is tcp, and we have  specified it to point to the 192.168.0.2 host on the 8080 port.  As simple as that, from now on, when we execute an act command on senecaEmailer,  the transport will send the message across to the e-mailer and receives the response.  Let's see the rest of the code:    seneca.add {area: "orders", action: "create"}, function args,       done  {     var products = args.products;     var total = 0.0;     products.forEach function product {       total += product.price;     } ;     var orders = this.make "orders" ;     orders.total = total;     orders.customer_email = args.email;     orders.customer_name = args.name;     orders.save$ function err, order  {       var pattern = {         area: "email",          action: "send",          template: "new_order",          to: args.email,         toName: args.name,         vars: {  [ 106 ]                ... vars for rendering the template including the               products ...         }       }       senecaEmailer.act pattern, done ;     } ;   } ;  As you can see, we are receiving a list of products with all the data needed and  passing them to the e-mailer to render the e-mail.  If we change the host where the e-mailer lives, the only change that we need to do  here is the configuration of the senecaEmailer variable.  Even if we change the nature of the channel  we could potentially even write a  plugin to send the data over Twitter, for example , the plugin should look after   the particularities of it and be transparent for the application.  Resilience over perfection In the example from the preceding section, we built a microservice that calls another  microservice in order to resolve the call that it receives. However, the following  points need to be kept in mind:     What happens if the e-mailer is down?    What happens if the configuration is wrong and the e-mailer is not working   on the correct port?  We could be throwing what ifs for few pages.  Humans are imperfect and so are the things that they build, and software is not an  exception. Humans are also bad at recognizing the potential problems in logical  flows, and software tends to be a complex system.  In other languages, playing with exceptions is almost something normal, but in  JavaScript, exceptions are a big deal:          If an exception bubbles out in a web app in Java, it kills the current stack of  calls and Tomcat  or the container that you use  returns an error to the client If an exception bubbles out in a Node.js app, the application is killed as we  only have one thread executing the app  As you can see, pretty much every single callback in Node.js has a first parameter  that is an error.  [ 107 ]   When talking about microservices, this error is especially important. You want  to be resilient. The fact that an e-mail has failed sending does not mean that the  order cannot be processed, but the e-mail could be manually sent later by someone  reprocessing the data. This is what we call eventual consistency; we factor into our  system the fact that at some point our system is going to crash.  In this case, if there is a problem sending the e-mail, but we could store the order in  the database, the calling code, in this case the UI, should have enough information to  decide whether the customer gets a fatal message or just a warning: Your order is ready to be processed, however it might take us two days to send you the e-mail  with the order details. Thanks for your patience.  Usually, the fact that our application will keep working even if we cannot complete  a request, it is usually more business than technical decision. This is an important  detail, as when building microservices, Conway's law is pushing us, the technical  people, to model the existing business process and partial success maps perfectly to  the human nature. If you can't complete a task, create a reminder in Evernote  or a  similar tool  and come back to it once the blocker is resolved.  This reads much better than the following: Something happened about something, but we can't tell you more  which is what my mind  reads sometimes when I get a general failure in some websites .  We call this way of handling errors system degradation: it might not be 100%  functional, but it will still work even though its few features are not available,  instead of a general failure.  If you think for a second, how many times a web service call has rolled back a full  transaction in your big corporate system only because it couldn't reach a third-party  service that might not even be important?  In this section, we built a microservice that uses another microservice to resolve a  request from a customer: order manager uses e-mailer to complete the request. We  have also talked about resilience and how important it is in our architecture in order  to provide the best service.  The UI – API aggregation Until now, we have built independent microservices. They had a specific purpose  and dealt with one specific part of our system: e-mail sending, product management,  and order processing, but now we are building a microservice whose only purpose is  to facilitate the communication between microservices.  [ 108 ]   Now we are going to build a microservice that interacts with others and is the   front-facing façade to the customer. When I was planning the contents of this chapter, a service like this one wasn't in it.  However, after thinking about it, this chapter wouldn't have been the same without  showing a few concepts around API aggregation that are fairly easy to show in a  frontend microservice.  Need for frontend microservice Think about scalability. When dealing with HTTP traffic, there is a pyramid of traffic.  There are more hits in the frontend than in the backend. Usually, in order to reach  the backend, the frontend needs to process the following few requests from the  frontend:     Read a form    Validate it    Manage the PRG pattern  https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Post   Redirect Get   As you can see, there is a lot of logic that needs to be processed by the frontend, so  that it is not hard to see capacity problems if the software is busy. If we are using a  microservice, and we are using it in the right way, scaling up or down should be an  automatic process that can be triggered with a couple of clicks  or commands .  The code Until now, we have pretty much always tested the code in a single server.   This is fine for testing, but when we are building microservices, we want them   to be distributed. Therefore, in order to achieve it, we need to indicate to Seneca   how to reach the services:  var senecaEmailer = require "seneca"   .client {   host: "192.168.0.2",    port: 8080 } ; var senecaProductManager = require "seneca"   .client {   host: "192.168.0.3",    port: 8080 } ; var senecaOrderProcessor = require "seneca"   .client {   host: "192.168.0.4",    port: 8080 } ;  [ 109 ]   What we have done is create three Seneca instances. They are like communication  pipes between servers.  Let's explain the code:  Seneca, by default, uses the transport plugin TCP. It means that Seneca  will be listening to the  act URL on the server. As an example, when  we create senecaEmailer, the URL where Seneca will be pointing to is  http:  192.168.0.2:8080 act.  We can actually verify it with curl. If we execute the following command line,  replacing   by a valid Seneca command, we should get a  response from the server in the JSON format, which would be the second parameter  in the done function for the action:  curl -d ' ' -v http:  192.168.0.2:8080 act  Seneca's default transport plugin is TCP. If we don't  specify any other, Seneca will use it to reach other servers  and listen to calls.  Let's see an easy example:  var seneca = require "seneca"   ; seneca.add {cmd: "test"}, function args, done  {   done null, {response: "Hello World!"} ; } ;  seneca.listen {port: 3000} ;  If we run this program, we can see the following output from the terminal:  It means that Seneca is listening to the port 3000. Let's test it:  curl -d '{"cmd": "test"}' -v http:  127.0.0.1:3000 act  [ 110 ]   This should print something very similar to the following code in the terminal:  The preceding code is the TCP IP dialog between our terminal and Seneca server  with the result of the response in the last line.  So, what we achieved earlier on having three different instances of Seneca is  configuring our network of microservices; Seneca will transport the messages   across the network for us.  [ 111 ]   The following flow diagram describes how a single API can hide multiple Seneca  servers in the backend with different microservices  different Seneca instances,  basically :  Now, let's take a look at the skeleton of the microservice:  var express = require "express" ; var bodyParser = require 'body-parser' ; var senecaEmailer = require "seneca"   .client {   host: "192.168.0.2",    port: 8080 } ; var senecaProductManager = require "seneca"   .client {   host: "192.168.0.3",    port: 8080 } ; var senecaOrderProcessor = require "seneca"   .client {   host: "192.168.0.4",    port: 8080 } ;  function api options  {   var seneca = this;       **    * Gets the full list of products  [ 112 ]      *    seneca.add {area: "ui", action: "products"}, function args,       done  {        More code to come   } ;    **    * Get a product by id    *    seneca.add {area: "ui", action: "productbyid"}, function args,       done  {        More code to come   } ;       **    * Creates an order    *    seneca.add {area: "ui", action: "createorder"}, function args,       done  {        More code to come   } ;    this.add "init:api", function msg, respond {     seneca.act 'role:web',{ use: {       prefix: ' api',       pin:  'area:ui,action:*',       map: {         products:  {GET:true}           productbyid: {GET:true, suffix:' :id'}         createorder: {POST:true}       }     }}, respond    } ; } module.exports = api; var seneca = require "seneca"   ; seneca.use api ;  var app = require "express"   ; app.use  require "body-parser" .json   ; app.use seneca.export "web"  ; app.listen 3000 ;  [ 113 ]   We have actually left the functionality that calls other microservices for later  discussion. Now we are going to focus on how the code is articulated:     We are creating a new plugin. The plugin is called api  the name of the   function for wrapping the plugin is api .     The plugin has to perform the following three actions:     List all the products    Get a product by ID    Create an order     These three actions will call to two different microservices: Product Manager   and Order Manager. We will come back to this topic later.  Seneca can be seamlessly integrated with Express in order to  provide web capabilities to Seneca microservices.  Until here, everything is well known, but what about the initialization function   of the plugin?  At first look, it looks like dark magic:    this.add "init:api", function msg, respond {     seneca.act 'role:web',{ use: {       prefix: ' api',       pin:  'area:ui,action:*',       map: {         products:  {GET:true}           productbyid: {GET:true, suffix:' :id'}         createorder: {POST:true}       }     }}, respond    } ;  Let's explain it:  the plugin.   api path.  1.  Seneca will call the init:   action in order to initialize    2.  Through the prefix argument, we are listening to URLs under the    [ 114 ]   3.  We are instructing Seneca to map the URLs to action by pinning a base   common argument. In this case, all our seneca.add ..  contains an argument  called area with the ui value. We are also asking Seneca to route calls that  contain the action argument  no matter the value, that is why we use the *  so  that it would ignore calls that don't specify the action argument.  The following argument  map  specifies the methods allowed in the matching.  How is the argument matching done?  The area argument is implicit as we have pinned it with the ui value.  The action argument needs to be present.  The URL must start with  api as we specified a prefix.  So, with this information,  api products will correspond to the {area: "ui",  action: "products"} action. In the same way,  api createorder will correspond  to the {area: "ui", action:"createorder"} action.  The Productbyid argument is a bit special.  The Seneca pin keyword is used to assume that the calling code  has a pair of argument-value so that it makes the code easier to  understand, but be careful, implicit values can have bad effects to  the readability.  Now, although it is not simple, this looks much easier.  Let's go back to the Seneca actions that are going to provide the functionality:     **    * Gets the full list of products.    *    seneca.add {area: "ui", action: "products"}, function args,       done  {     senecaProductManager.act {area: "product", action: "fetch"},         function err, result  {       done err, result ;     } ;   } ;       **    * Get a product by id.    *   [ 115 ]     seneca.add {area: "ui", action: "productbyid"}, function args,       done  {     senecaProductManager.act {area: "product", action: "fetch",         criteria: "byId", id: args.id}, function err, result  {       done err, result ;     } ;   } ;       **    * Creates an order to buy a single prodct.    *    seneca.add {area: "ui", action: "createorder"}, function args,       done  {     senecaProductManager.act {area: "product", action: "fetch",         criteria: "byId", id: args.id}, function err, product  {       if err  done err, null ;       senecaOrderProcessor.act area: "orders", action: "create",           products: [product], email: args.email, name: args.name,             function err, order  {         done err, order ;       } ;     } ;   } ;  Warning! In the services written in this chapter, there is no data  validation performed in order to make the concepts around the  design of microservices clear. You should always validate the  incoming data from untrusted systems  such as customers input .  We are actually using everything that we've discussed in the previous chapters, but  we are taking a step forward in the Seneca semantics.  We have created an API with a very limited set of functionalities, but through them,  we are aggregating the functionality of different microservices into one.  A detail to take into account is the amount of nested calls in the create order action   the last one . In this case, we are creating orders out of only a product to simplify  the code, but if we are nesting too many calls for non-blocking actions waiting for  the response in a callback, we will end up having a pyramid of code that makes your  program difficult to read.  The solution for it would be to refactor how the data is fetched and or reorganize  the anonymous functions, avoiding inlining.  [ 116 ]   Another solution is the usage of promises libraries such as Q or Bluebird  http:   bluebirdjs.com   that allow us to chain the flow of the methods through promises:  myFunction  .then function   {    Code here } .then function  {    More code here } .catch function error {    Handle the error. } ;  In this way, instead of building a sea of callbacks, we are nicely chaining the calls to  the methods and adding error handlers to avoid the exceptions from bubbling up.  As you can see, we are using the UI as a central point of communication for all the  microservices, except for the mailer, and we have a really good reason for it.  Service degradation – when the failure is not  a disaster Microservices are great, and we have demonstrated that by writing a small system in  a few hundred lines of code that is fairly easy to understand.  They are also great as they allow us to react in the event of a failure:     What happens if the e-mailer microservice stops working?    What happens if the order processor stops working?    Can we recover from the situation?    What does the customer see?  These questions, on a monolithic system, are nonsense. The e-mailer probably would  be a part of the application. The failure on sending an e-mail implies a general error,  unless it is specifically handled. Same with the order processor.  However, what about our microservices-oriented architecture?  The fact that the e-mailer has failed to deliver a few e-mails does not prevent the  orders from being processed, even though the customers aren't getting the e-mails.  This is what we call performance or service degradation; the system might be slower,  but some functionalities will still work.  [ 117 ]   Service degradation is the ability of a system to lose a  feature without suffering a general failure.  What about the order manager? Well...we can still make the products-related calls  work, but we won't be able to process any order…which might still be a good thing.  The fact that the order manager is responsible for sending the e-mail instead of  the UI microservice is not coincidental; we only want to send the e-mail with the  acknowledgement of a sale on the success event, and we don't want to send the  success e-mail in any other case.  Circuit breakers In the previous section, we talked about system degradation in the event of a failure,  but everybody who has worked in IT for a number of years knows that a system  does not fail suddenly in most cases of failures.  The most common event is a timeout; the server is busy for a period of time, which  makes the request to fail, giving our customers a terrible user experience.  How can we solve this particular problem?   We can solve this problem with a circuit breaker, as shown in the following image:  [ 118 ]   A circuit breaker is a mechanism to prevent requests from reaching an unstable  server that could cause our application to misbehave.  As you can see in the preceding schema, the circuit breaker has the following   three statuses:     Closed: The circuit is closed; the requests reach their destination.    Open: The circuit is open; the requests don't get past the circuit breaker    and the client gets an error. The system will retry the communication after   a time period.     HalfOpen: The circuit tests the service again, and if there is no error reaching   it, the requests can flow again and the circuit breaker is Closed.  With this simple mechanism, we can prevent the errors to cascade through our  system, avoiding catastrophic failures.  Ideally, the circuit breaker should be asynchronous. This means that even if there  are no requests, every few seconds milliseconds, the system should be trying to  re-establish the connection to the faulty service in order to continue the normal  operation.  Failure is a common denominator in the human  nature: better be prepared for it.  Circuit breakers are also an ideal place to alert the support engineers. Depending on  the nature of our system, the fact that a given service cannot be reached could mean  a serious issue. Can you imagine a bank that is unable to reach the SMS service to  send two-factor authentication codes? No matter how hard we try, it will always  happen at some point. So, be prepared for it.  There is a very inspiring article from Martin Fowler  one of the big names  in microservices  about circuit breakers at http:  martinfowler. com bliki CircuitBreaker.html.  [ 119 ]   Seneca – a simple puzzle that makes our lives  easier Seneca is great. It enables the developers to take a simple and small idea and  translate it into a piece of code with a connection point that does not make any  assumption, just facts. An action has a clear input and provides you the interface   to give an answer for it through a callback.  How many times have you found your team struggling with the class structure of an  application just to reuse code in a nice way? Seneca focuses on simplicity. The fact that we are not modeling objects, but just parts  of systems using small portions of code that are extremely cohesive and idempotent  to objects makes our life much easier. Another way how Seneca makes our life easy is through the plugability. If you review the code that we have been writing in this book, the first thing that will  be spotted is how convenient the plugins are.  They provide the right level of encapsulation for a bunch of actions  Does it look  similar to a class?  that are somehow related to each other.  I always try not to over-engineer solutions. It is really easy to fall into premature  abstraction, preparing the code for a future that we don't know whether it it is going  to happen in the majority of the cases.  We don't realize how long we spend maintaining features that have been overdesigned  and need to be tested every time someone changes the code around them.  Seneca avoids  or at least discourages  this type of designs. Think about Seneca  actions as a small piece of paper  like a post-it , where you need to write what  happened last week. You need to be smart about what to fit in there, and possibly,  split it into another post-it if the content gets to dense.  Another point where Seneca is good is in configurability. As we have seen before,  Seneca comes with a number of integrations for data storage and transport.  [ 120 ]   An important side of Seneca is the transport protocol. As we know by now, the  default transport is carried over TCP, but can we use a message queue to do it? The  structure is shown as follows:  Yes, we can. It is already done and maintained.  The following URL is a plugin for Seneca that allows it to send messages  over RabbitMQ instead of HTTP: https:  github.com senecajs seneca-rabbitmq-transport  If you look into the code of the plugin  it looks really complex, but it is not , you can  spot where the magic happens in few seconds:    seneca.add {role: 'transport', hook: 'listen', type: 'rabbitmq'},  hook_listen_rabbitmq    seneca.add {role: 'transport', hook: 'client', type: 'rabbitmq'},  hook_client_rabbitmq   Seneca is using Seneca actions to delegate the transport of the message. Although it  looks a bit recursive, it is brilliant!  Once you understand how Seneca and the transport protocol chosen work, you are  immediately qualified to write a transport plugin for Seneca.  When I started learning about Seneca in order to write this  book, I also wrote a transport plugin to use NServiceBus   http:  particular.net  .  NServiceBus is an interesting idea, it allows you to connect a number of storages and  AMPQ-compliant systems and use them as clients. For example, we could be writing  messages in a SQL Server table and consuming them from a queue once they get  routed through NServiceBus, having immediate auditing capabilities on the history  of the messages.  With such flexibility, we could potentially write a plugin that uses pretty much  anything as a transport protocol.  [ 121 ]   Seneca and promises All our code from the previous chapters is relying on callbacks. Callbacks are good  as far as your code does not nest them on more than three levels.  However, there is an even better way of managing the asynchronous nature of  JavaScript: promises. Take a look at the following code:               promise demo            Go   Ready...                  var effect = function   {   return $  "div"  .fadeIn  800  .delay  1200  .fadeOut  ; };   $  "button"  .on  "click", function   {   $  "p"  .append  " Started... "  ;     $.when  effect    .done function   {   $  "p"  .append  " Finished! "  ;   } ; } ;          The preceding code is an example of the JQuery fragment using promises.  [ 122 ]   A promise, by its definition is: A declaration or assurance that one will do something or that a particular thing will happen.  That is exactly it. If you see the preceding code, $.when, returns a promise. We don't  know how long the effect function will take, but we can guarantee that once it is  ready, the function inside of done will be executed. It looks very similar to callbacks,  but take a look at the following code:  callhttp url1, data1 .then function result1  {       result1 is available here    return callhttp url2, data2 ; } .then function result2  {       only result2 is available here    return callhttp url3, data3 ; } .then function result3  {       all three are done now, final result is in result3 } ;  Don't try to execute it, it is just a hypothetical example, but what we are doing in  there is chain promises; and that makes the code vertical instead of ending up in a  pyramid-shaped program, which is a lot harder to read, as shown in the following  diagram:  [ 123 ]   Seneca, by default, is not a promise-oriented framework, but  there is always a but   using Bluebird, one of the most famous promises libraries in JavaScript, we can  promisify Seneca, as follows:  var Promise = require 'bluebird' ; var seneca = require 'seneca'   ;     Promisify the .act   method; to learn more about this technique     see:    http:  bluebirdjs.com docs features.htmlpromisification-on-    steroids var act = Promise.promisify seneca.act, seneca ;     Return no error and a success message to illustrate a resolved     promise seneca.add {cmd: 'resolve'}, function  args, done  {   done null, {message: "Yay, I've been resolved!"} ; } ;     Return an error to force a rejected promise seneca.add {cmd: 'reject'}, function  args, done  {   done new Error "D'oh! I've been rejected."  ; } ;     Use the new promisified act   with no callback act {cmd: 'resolve'}    .then function  result  {      result will be {message: "Yay, I've been resolved!"} since       its guaranteed to resolve   }    .catch function  err  {      Catch any error as usual if it was rejected   } ;  act {cmd: 'reject'}    .then function  result  {      Never reaches here since we throw an error on purpose   }    .catch function  err  {      err will be set with message "D'oh! I've been rejected."   } ;  There are two important details in the preceding code:  var act = Promise.promisify seneca.act, seneca ;  [ 124 ]   This creates a promisified version of the act function and its use, as follows:  act {cmd: 'reject'}    .then function  result  {      Never reaches here since we throw an error on purpose   }    .catch function  err  {      err will be set with message "D'oh! I've been rejected."   } ;  An important detail in this last fragment; instead of receiving a callback with the  following two parameters:     An error    The results  We are chaining the following two methods:     Then: This is executed when the promise is resolved    Catch: This is executed if there is an error while resolving the promise  This type of constructions allows us to write the following code:  act {cmd: 'timeout'}    .then function  result  {      Never reaches here since the gate executer times out   }    .catch function  err  {      err will be set with a timeout error thrown by the gate executer   } ;  This code is handling something that we have never talked about before: the gate  executor timeouts. It happens when Seneca cannot reach the destination in some  situations, and it can be easily handled with a promise as shown earlier. The then part  would never be executed as the function will only be called when there is an error.  There are a few well-consolidated options in the market now for promises in  JavaScript. Nowadays, my preferred choice would be Bluebird  https:  github. com petkaantonov bluebird  because of its simplicity. Q is another option used  by AngularJS  one of the most popular SPA frameworks , but for day-to-day use, it  looks more complicated than Bluebird.  [ 125 ]   Debugging Debugging a Node.js application is very similar to debugging any other application.  IDEs like WebStorm or IntelliJ provide a traditional debugger where you can install  breakpoints and stop the execution whenever the application hits the given line.  This is perfect if you buy a license for one of the IDEs, but there is a free alternative  that will have a very similiar result for the users of Google Chrome, node-inspector. Node-inspector is an npm package that pretty much enables the Chrome debugger to  debug Node.js applications.  Let's see how it works:  1.  First of all, we need to install node-inspector:  npm install –g node-inspector  This should add a command to our system called node-inspector. If we  execute it, we get the following output:  That means our debug server has started.  2.  Now we need to run a node application with a special flag to indicate that it   needs to be debugged. Let's take a simple Seneca act as an example: var seneca = require  'seneca'     seneca.add {role: 'math', cmd: 'sum'}, function  msg,     respond  {   var sum = msg.left + msg.right   respond null, {answer: sum}  }   seneca.add {role: 'math', cmd: 'product'}, function  msg,     respond  {   var product = msg.left * msg.right   respond  null, { answer: product }   }   seneca.act {role: 'math', cmd: 'sum', left: 1, right: 2},     console.log   [ 126 ]   seneca.act {role: 'math', cmd: 'product', left: 3, right: 4},     console.log   3.  Now, in order to run it on the debug mode, execute the following command:  node index.js --debug-brk  The way to access the debugger is through the URL http:  127.0.0.1:808 0 ?port=5858:  I am sure this image is very familiar to every developer in the world: it is the Chrome  debugger showing our code. As you can see in the first line, the one highlighted  in blue, the application stopped in the first instruction so that we can place the  breakpoints by clicking the line numbers, as shown in the following image:  [ 127 ]   As you can see in the preceding image, we have installed a breakpoint in line 9.   Now we can use the control panel to navigate through the code and values of   our variables:  The controls on the top speak for themselves if you ever debugged an application:     The first button is called play and it allows the application to run to the    next breakpoint     Step over executes the next line in the current file    Step into goes into the next line, getting deeper in the call stack so that we   can see the call hierarchy     Step out is the reverse of step into    Disable breakpoints will prevent the program from stopping at the   breakpoints     Pause on exceptions, as its name indicates, will cause the program to stop on   exceptions  it is very useful when trying to catch errors   [ 128 ]   If we click on play, we can see how the script will stop in line 9 in the following image:  As a good debugger, it will let us inspect the value of our variables by hovering the  cursor over the variable name.  Summary This chapter has been pretty intense. We have gone through a lot of content that  helped us in building a small microservices ecosystem that, when orchestrated  together, would fairly work well. We have been a bit simplistic some times, but the  idea of the book is to indicate the power of the microservices-oriented software. At this  stage, I would recommend the reader to start performing some testing around Seneca.  The documentation on the website is quite helpful, and there are a lot of examples   to follow.  There are a few plugins for storage and transport, as well as other type of plugins   such as user authentication , that would allow you to experiment with different  features of Seneca.  We will be talking more about some of them in the following chapters.  [ 129 ]    Security and Traceability  Security is one of the biggest concerns in systems nowadays. The amount of  information leaked from big companies is worrying, especially because 90% of  the information leaks could be mended with very small actions by the software  developers. Something similar happens with the logging of events and the  traceability of errors. No one really pays too much attention until someone requests  the logs that you don't have in order to audit a failure. In this chapter, we will  discuss how to manage security and logging so that our system is safe and traceable,  with the help of the following topics:      Infrastructure logical security: We will discuss how to secure our software  infrastructure in order to provide the industry standard security layer in our  communications.     Application security: We will introduce the common techniques to secure  our applications. Practices such as output encoding or input validation are  the industry standard and they could save us from a catastrophe.     Traceability: Being able to follow the requests around our system is a must  in microservices architectures. We will leverage this task to Seneca and learn  how to get the information from this fantastic framework.     Auditing: Even though we put our best efforts in building a software,   accidents happen. The ability to rebuild the sequence of calls and see exactly  what happened is important. We will discuss how to enable our system in  order to be able to recover the required information.  Infrastructure logical security Infrastructure security is usually ignored by software engineers as it is completely  different from their area of expertise. However, nowadays, and especially if your  career is leaning towards DevOps, it is a subject that should not be ignored.  [ 131 ]   In this book, we are not going to go very deep into the infrastructure security more  than few rules of thumb to keep your microservices safe.  It is strongly recommended for the readers to read and learn about cryptography and  all the implications around the usage of SSH, which is one of the main resources for  keeping communications secure nowadays.  SSH – encrypting the communications In any organization, there is a strict list of people who can access certain services. In  general, this authentication for these services is done via username and password,  but it can also be done using a key to verify the identity of the user.  No matter what authentication method is used, the communication should always be  done over a secure channel such as SSH. SSH stands for Secure Shell and it is a software used to access shells in remote  machines, but it can also be a very helpful tool to create proxies and tunnels to   access remote servers.  Let's explain how it works using the following command:   home david: develop   ssh david@192.168.0.1  The authenticity of host '192.168.0.1  192.168.0.1 ' can't be  established.  RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:S22 A2  eqxSqkS4VfR1BrcDxNX1rmfM1JkZaGhrjMbk.  Are you sure you want to continue connecting  yes no ? yes  Warning: Permanently added '192.168.0.1'  RSA  to the list of known  hosts.  vagrant@192.168.0.1's password:  Last login: Mon Jan 25 02:30:21 2016 from 10.0.2.2  Welcome to your virtual machine.  In this case, I am using Vagrant to facilitate the building of virtual machines. Vagrant  is a very popular tool to automate development environments and their website   https:  www.vagrantup.com   consists of useful information.  [ 132 ]   In the first line, we execute the ssh david@192.168.0.1 command. This command  tries to open a terminal as the user david in the 192.168.0.1 host.  As it is the first time that this command is executed against the machine in the IP  192.168.0.1, our computer will not trust the remote server.  This is done by maintaining a file called known_hosts, under the  home david . ssh known_hosts folder in this case  it will depend on the user .  This file is a list of hosts with the corresponding key. As you can see, the following  two lines explain that the host cannot be trusted and present the fingerprint of the key  held by the remote server in order to verify it:  The authenticity of host '192.168.0.1  192.168.0.1 ' can't be  established.  RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:S22 A2  eqxSqkS4VfR1BrcDxNX1rmfM1JkZaGhrjMbk.  At this point, the user is supposed to verify the identity of the server by checking the  key. Once this is done, we can instruct SSH to connect to the server, which will result  in the following log being printed:  Warning: Permanently added '192.168.0.1'  RSA  to the list of known  hosts.  Now, if we check our known_hosts file, we can see that the key has been added to  the list, as follows:  This key stored in the known_hosts file is the public key of the remote server.  [ 133 ]   SSH uses a cryptography algorithm called RSA. This algorithm is built around the  concept of asymmetric cryptography, which is shown in the following image:  The asymmetric cryptography relies on a set of keys: one public and one private. As  the name states, the public key can be shared with everyone; whereas, the private  key has to be kept secret.  The messages encrypted with the private key can only be decrypted with the public  key and the other way around so that it is almost impossible  unless someone gets  the other half of the key  to intercept and decrypt a message.  At this point, our computer knows the public key of the server and we are in a  position to start an encrypted session with the server. Once we get the terminal, all the  commands and results of these commands will be encrypted and sent over the wire.  [ 134 ]   This key can also be used to connect to a remote server without password. The only  thing we need to do is generate an SSH key in our machine and install it in the server  in a file called authorized_keys under the .ssh folder, where the known_hosts   file is.  When working with microservices, you can be remotely logged in to quite a few  different machines so that this approach becomes more attractive. However, we need  to be very careful about how we handle the private keys because if a user leaks that  private key, our infrastructure could be compromised.  Application security Application security is becoming more and more important. As the cloud is  becoming the de-facto standard for infrastructure in large companies, we can't   rely on the fact that the data is confined in a single data centre.  Usually, when someone starts a new business, the main focus is to build the   product from the functional point of view. Security is not the main focus and   usually gets overlooked.  This is a very dangerous practice and we are going to amend that by letting the  reader know the main security threats that could compromise our application.  The main four big security points to develop applications in a secure manner are   as follows:  Injection        Cross-site scripting    Cross-site request forgery token protection    Open redirects  At the end of this section, we will be able to identify the main vulnerabilities, but we  won't be armored against a malicious attacker. In general, a software engineer should  be up to date with the security as much as they are up to date with new technologies.  No matter how good the product you build is, if it is not secure, someone will find  out and take the advantage of it.  Common threats – how to be up to date As we stated before, security is an ongoing subject in application development.  No matter what type of software you are building, there will always be security  implications around it.  [ 135 ]   The best way I've found during my professional career to be up to date with security  around web development without being a full-time dedicated security engineer is  to follow the OWASP project. OWASP stands for Open Web Application Security  Project and they produce quite an interesting document  among others  on a yearly  basis called OWASP Top 10.  OWASP Top 10 was first published in 2003 and its goal is to raise  awareness in the development community about the most common  threats in application development.  In the previous section, we identified the four main security issues that a software  developer can face and all of them are mentioned in the following sections.  Injection Injection is, by far, the most dangerous attack that we could be exposed to.  Specifically, a SQL injection is the most common form of injection that affects  applications and it consists of an attacker forcing a SQL code in one of our application  queries, leading to a different query that could compromise the data of our company.  There are other types of injections, but we are going to focus on SQL injection, as  pretty much every application in the modern world uses a relational database.  SQL injection consists of the injection or manipulation of SQL queries in our  application through the input from non-validated sources, such as a web form   or any other data source with arbitrary input of text.  Let's consider the following example:  SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'username' AND password = 'password'  Never store passwords in plain in the database. Always hash  and salt them to avoid rainbow-table attacks. This is just an  example.  This query will give us the user that corresponds to a given name and password. In  order to build the query from the client's input, we can consider doing something  similar to the following code as a good idea:  var express = require 'express' ; var app = express  ; var mysql      = require 'mysql' ;  var connection = mysql.createConnection {  [ 136 ]     host     : 'localhost',   user     : 'me',   password : 'secret',   database : 'test_db' } ;  app.get ' login', function req, res  {   var username = req.param "username" ;   var password = req.param "password" ;      connection.connect  ;   var query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username       + "' AND password = '" + password + "'";   connection.query query, function err, rows, fields  {     if  err  throw err;     res.send rows ;   } ;   connection.end  ; } ;  app.listen 3000, function   {   console.log "Application running in port 3000." ; } ;  At first sight, it looks like an easy program that accesses the database called test_db  and issues a query to check whether there is a user that matches the username and  password and renders it back to the client so that if we open the browser and try to  browse to the http:  localhost:3000 login?username=david&password=mypassw ord URL, the browser will render a JSON object with the result of the following query:  SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'david' AND password = 'mypassword'  Nothing strange yet, but what happens if the customer tries to hack us?  Take a look at the following input:  http:  localhost:3000 login?username=' OR 1=1 --&password=mypassword  As you can see, the query generated by it is the following code:  SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR 1=1 -- AND password =  'mypassword'  In SQL, the -- character sequence is used to comment the rest of the line so that the  effective query would be as follows:  SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='' OR 1=1  [ 137 ]   This query returns the full list of users, and if our software is using the result of this  query to resolve whether the user should be logged in or not, we are in some serious  problems. We have just granted access to our system to someone who does not even  know a valid username.  This is one of the many examples on how SQL injection can affect us.  In this case, it is pretty obvious that we are concatenating untrusted data  coming  from the user  into our query, but believe me, when the software gets more  complicated, it is not always easy to identify.  A way to avoid SQL injection is through the usage of prepared statements. Input validation Applications interact with users mainly through forms. These forms usually contain  free text input fields that could lead to an attack.  The easiest way to prevent corrupted data from getting into our server is through  input validation, which as the name suggests, consists of validating the input from  the user to avoid the situation described earlier.  There are two types of input validation, as follows:     White listing    Black listing  Black listing is a dangerous technique. In majority of cases, trying to define what is  incorrect in the input takes a lot more effort than simply defining what we expect. The recommended approach is  and will always be  to white list the data coming  from the user, validating it through the use of a regular expression: we know how a  phone number looks like, we also know how a username should look like, and so on.  Input validation is not always easy. If you have ever come across the validation of an  e-mail, you will know what I am talking about: the regular expression to validate an  e-mail is anything but simple.  The fact that there is not an easy way to validate some data should not restrict us from  doing it as the omission of input validation could lead to a serious security flaw.  Input validation is not the silver bullet for SQL injections, but it also helps with other  security threats such as cross-site scripting.  In the query from the previous section, we do something quite dangerous:  concatenate user input into our query.  [ 138 ]   One of the solutions could be to use some sort of escaping library that will sanitize  the input from the user, as follows:  app.get ' login', function req, res  {   var username = req.param "username" ;   var password = req.param "password" ;      connection.connect  ;   var query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" +       connection.escape username  + "' AND password = '" +       connection.escape password  + "'";   connection.query query, function err, rows, fields  {     if  err  throw err;     res.send rows ;   } ;   connection.end  ; } ;  In this case, the mysql library used provides a suite of methods to escape strings.  Let's see how it works:  var mysql = require 'mysql' ; var connection = mysql.createConnection {   host: 'localhost',   username: 'root',   password: 'root' } ;  console.log connection.escape "' OR 1=1 --"    The small script from earlier escapes the string provided as username in the previous  example, the result is \' OR 1=1 --.  As you can see, the escape   method has replaced the dangerous characters,  sanitizing the input from the user.  Cross-site scripting Cross-site scripting, also known as XSS, is a security vulnerability that mainly  affects web applications. It is one of the most common security issues and the  implications can be huge for the customer as potentially, someone could steal   the user identity with this attack.  The attack is an injection code put into a third-party website that could steal data  from the client's browser. There are a few ways of doing it, but by far, the most  common is by unescaped input from the client.  [ 139 ]   In few websites on the Internet, users can add comments containing arbitrary input.  This arbitrary input can contain script tags that load a JavaScript from a remote  server that can steal the session cookie  or other types of valuable information ,  letting the attacker replicate the user session on a remote machine. There are two main types of XSS attacks: persistent and non-persistent. The persistent type of XSS consists of storing the XSS attack by crafting a particular  string of text that resolves into the attack once it is displayed to the user in the  website. This code could be injected via an arbitrary input text that is stored in the  database  such as a comment in a forum . The non-persistent type of XSS is when the attack is inserted into a non-persistent  part of the application due to bad data handling.  Let's take a look at the following screenshot:  [ 140 ]   As you can see, we have searched for a book  this book  in http:  www.amazon. co.uk . It does not produce any output  as the book is not published yet , but it  specifies that Your search "microservices nodejs" did not match any products,  which is somehow using the input from the web browser as output. Even more,  when I clicked on search, Amazon redirected me to the following URL:  http:  www.amazon.co.uk s ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search- alias%3Daps&field-keywords=microservices+nodejs  We know Amazon is secure, but if it was sensible to XSS attacks, we could have  modified the value of the field-keywords parameter to craft a request that injected  a script tag in the content, leading to the attacker being able to steal the session  cookie that could result in some serious problems for the website. Output encoding A way to protect against this attack is output encoding. We have done it before,  when we used connection.escape   in the Input validation section of this chapter.  In fairness, we should be validating all the data entered from the user and encoding  all the outputs that come from third parties. This includes the input entered by the  user, as well as sources of information coming from outside of the system.  When narrowing the problem to web development, we have to be aware of the three  different areas where output encoding is needed:     CSS       HTML  JavaScript  The most problematic two are JavaScript and HTML, where an attacker could easily  steal information without too much effort.  Generally, no matter which framework we use for building our app, it always has  functions to encode the output.  Cross-site request forgery Cross-site request forgery  CSRF  is the reverse of cross-site request scripting. In  cross-site request scripting, the problem is in the client trusting the data coming from  the server. With cross-site request forgery, the problem is that the server trusts the  data coming from the client.  After stealing the session cookie, the attacker can not only steal information from the  user, but can also modify the information of the account associated with the cookie.  [ 141 ]   This is done by posting the data to the server via HTTP requests.  HTTP classifies its requests in methods. A method is basically used to specify what is  the operation to be carried by the request. The most interesting four methods are the  following ones:     GET: This gets the data from the server. It should not modify any persistent   data.     POST: This creates a resource in the server.    PUT: This updates a resource in the server.    DELETE: This deletes a resource from the server.  There are more methods  such as PATCH or CONNECT , but let's focus on these four.  As you can see, three of these four methods modify data from the server, and a user  with a valid session could potentially steal data, create payments, order goods, and  so on.  A way to avoid the cross-site request forgery attack is by protecting the POST, PUT  and DELETE endpoints with a cross-site request token.  Take a look at the following HTML form:               This form describes a perfectly valid situation: a user registering on our website; very  simple, but still valid and flawed.  We are specifying a URL and the list of expected parameters so that an attacker can  register hundreds or thousands of accounts within a span of minutes, with a small  script that issues a POST request with the two parameters  email and password  in  the body.  Now, look at the following form:              <input name="csrftoken" type="hidden"       value="as7d6fasd678f5a5sf5asf"  >    You can see the difference: there is an extra hidden parameter called csrftoken.  [ 142 ]   This parameter is a random string that is generated every time a form is rendered so  that we can add this extra parameter to every form.  Once the form is submitted, the csrftoken parameter is validated to only let go  through the requests with a valid token and generate a new token to be rendered on  the page again.  Open redirects Sometimes, our application might need to redirect the user to a certain URL. For  example, when hitting a private URL without a valid authentication, the user will  usually be redirected to the login page:  http:  www.mysite.com my-private-page  This could result into a redirect to the following:  http:  www.mysite.com login?redirect= my-private-page  This sounds legit. The user is sent to the login page, and once he provides a valid set  of credentials, it is redirected to  my-private-page.  What happens if someone tries to steal the account of our user?  Look at the following request:  http:  www.mysite.com login?redirect=http:  myslte.com  This is a crafted request that will redirect the user to myslte.com instead of mysite. com  note the l instead of i .  Someone could make myslte.com look like the login page of mysite.com and steal  your user's password and username by distributing the preceding URL in the social  media as the users will be redirected to a malicious page.  The solution for the preceding problem is quite simple: don't redirect the user to  untrusted third-party websites.  Again, the best way of doing such task is white listing the target hosts for redirects.  Basically, we don't let our software redirect our customers to unknown websites.  [ 143 ]   Effective code reviews One of the most effective ways to reduce security flaws in our applications is through  a systematic and informed code review process. The problem with code reviews is  that they always end up being a dump area for opinions and personal preferences  that usually not only won't improve the quality of the code, but will also lead to last  minute changes that could expose vulnerabilities in our application.  A dedicated stage in the product development life cycle for a security code review  helps to drastically reduce the amount of bugs delivered to production.  The problem that the software engineers have is that their mind is trained to build  things that work well, but they don't have the mindset to find defects, especially  around the things that they build. This is why you should not be testing your own  code  any further than the test carried on when developing , and even less, security  testing your application.  However, we usually work in teams and that enables us to review someone else's  code, but we have to do it in an effective manner.  Code reviews require as much brain power as needed to write software, especially  if you are reviewing a complex code. You should never spend more than two hours  reviewing the same functionality, otherwise important flaws will be missed and  attention to detail will decrease to a worrying level.  This is not a big problem in microservices-based architectures as the functionality  should be small enough to be read in a reasonable period of time, especially if you  talked to the author about what he was trying to build.  You should always follow a two phase review, as follows:     Review the code quickly to get the big picture: how it works, what   technology it uses that you are not familiar with, does it do what it is  supposed to do, and so on     Review the code following a checklist of items to look for  This list of items has to be decided upfront and depends on the nature of the  software that your company is building.  [ 144 ]   Usually, the list of items to check around the code security concerns during a code  review is quite big, but we can narrow it down to the following components:  Is all the input validated encoded when applicable? Is all the output encoded, including logs?           Do we protect endpoints with cross-site request forgery tokens?    Are all the user credentials encrypted or hashed in the database?  If we check this list, we will be able to identify the biggest issues around security in  our apps.  Traceability Traceability is extremely important in the modern information systems. It is a  delicate matter in microservices that is gracefully solved in Seneca, making the  requests easy to follow around our system so that we can audit the failure.  Logging Seneca is pretty good with the logging. There are so many options that can be  configured in Seneca in order to get the required information about how everything  is working  if it is working .  Let's see how logging works with a small application:  var seneca = require "seneca"   ;  seneca.add {cmd: "greeter"}, function args, callback {   callback null, {message: "Hello " + args.name} ; } ;  seneca.act {cmd: "greeter", name: "David"}, function err, result  {   console.log result ; } ;  This is the simplest Seneca application that can be written. Let's run it as follows:  seneca  node index.js  2016-02-01T09:55:40.962Z 3rhomq69cbe0 1454579740947 84217 - INFO hello Se neca 1.0.0 3rhomq69cbe0 1454579740947 84217 -  { message: 'Hello David' }  [ 145 ]   This is the result of running the app with the default logging configuration. Aside  from the console.log   method that we have used in the code, there is some  internal information about Seneca being logged. Sometimes, you might want to  only log what your application is producing so that you can debug the application  without all the noise. In this case, just run the following command:  seneca  node index.js --seneca.log.quiet  { message: 'Hello David' }  However, sometimes, there are weird behaviors in the system  or even a bug in the  frameworks used  and you want to get all the information about what is happening.  Seneca supports that as well, as shown in the following command:  seneca  node index.js --seneca.log.print  The preceding command will print an endless amount of information that might not  be helpful.  In order to reduce the amount of logging produced by Seneca, there is a fine-grain  control in what gets logged into the output. Let's take a look at the following lines:  2016-02-01T10:00:07.191Z dyy9ixcavqu4 1454580006885 85010 - DEBUG  register install transport {exports:[transport utils]} seneca-8t1dup  2016-02-01T10:00:07.305Z dyy9ixcavqu4 1454580006885 85010 - DEBUG  register init seneca-y9os9j  2016-02-01T10:00:07.305Z dyy9ixcavqu4 1454580006885 85010 - DEBUG plugin  seneca-y9os9j DEFINE {}  2016-02-01T10:00:07.330Z dyy9ixcavqu4 1454580006885 85010 -  DEBUG act root$       IN o5onzziv9i7a b7dtf6v1u9sq cmd:greeter  {cmd:greeter,name:David} ENTRY  mnb89  - - -  They are random lines from a log output on the preceding code example, but it will  give us useful information: these entries are debug-level log lines for different actions   such as plugin, register, and act  on the Seneca framework. In order to filter them,  Seneca provides a control over what levels or actions do we want to see. Consider  the following for example:  node index.js --seneca.log=level:INFO  This will only output the logs related to the INFO level:  seneca  node index.js --seneca.log=level:INFO  2016-02-04T10:39:04.685Z q6wnh8qmm1l3 1454582344670 91823 - INFO hello  Seneca 1.0.0 q6wnh8qmm1l3 1454582344670 91823 -  { message: 'Hello David' }  [ 146 ]   You can also filter by action type, which is quite interesting. When you are working  with microservices, knowing the chain of events that happened in a flow is one  of the first things that you need to look into in order to audit a failure. With this  control over the logging that Seneca gives us, it is as easy as executing the following  command:  node index.js --seneca.log=type:act  This will produce the following output:  As you can see, all the preceding lines correspond to the act type, and even more,  if we follow the output of the command from top to bottom, we exactly know the  sequence of events to which Seneca reacted and their order.  Tracing requests Tracing requests is also a very important activity, and sometimes, it is even a legal  requirement, especially if you work in the world of finance. Again, Seneca is fantastic  at tracing requests. For every call, Seneca generates a unique identifier. This identifier  can be traced across all the paths to where the call is going to, as follows:  var seneca = require "seneca"   ;  seneca.add {cmd: "greeter"}, function args, callback {   console.log this.fixedargs['tx$'] ;   callback null, {message: "Hello " + args.name} ; } ; seneca.act {cmd: "greeter", name: "David"}, function err, result  {   console.log this.fixedargs['tx$'] ; } ;  Here, we are logging a dictionary that contains the transaction ID in Seneca to the  terminal. So, if we execute it, we will get the following output:  2016-02-04T10:58:07.570Z zl0u7hj3hbeg 1454583487555 95159 - INFO hello  Seneca 1.0.0 zl0u7hj3hbeg 1454583487555 95159 -  3jlroj2n91da  3jlroj2n91da  [ 147 ]   You can see how all the requests in Seneca are traced: the framework assigns an ID  and it gets propagated across endpoints. In this case, all our endpoints are in the  local machine, but if we distribute them in different machines, the ID will still be   the same.  With this unique ID, we will be able to reconstruct the journey of the customer data  in our system, and ordering the requests with the associated timestamp, we can get  an accurate picture of what the user was doing, how much time did every action  take, what are the possible problems associated with delays, and so on. Usually, the  logging combined with circuit breakers output information allows the engineers to  solve issues within a very reduced time frame.  Auditing Up till now, we have been using console.log   to output the data into the logs.  This is a bad practice. It breaks the format of the logs and throws the content to the  standard output.  Again, Seneca comes to the rescue:  var seneca = require "seneca"   ;  seneca.add {cmd: "greeter"}, function args, callback {   this.log.warn this.fixedargs['tx$'] ;   callback null, {message: "Hello " + args.name} ; } ;  seneca.act {cmd: "greeter", name: "David"}, function err, result  {   this.log.warn this.fixedargs['tx$'] ; } ;  Let's see what Seneca produces as output:  seneca  node index.js  2016-02-04T11:17:28.772Z wo10oa299tub 1454584648758 98550 - INFO hello  Seneca 1.0.0 wo10oa299tub 1454584648758 98550 -  2016-02-04T11:17:29.156Z wo10oa299tub 1454584648758 98550 - WARN - - ACT  02jlpyiux70s 9ca086d19x7n cmd:greeter 9ca086d19x7n  2016-02-04T11:17:29.157Z wo10oa299tub 1454584648758 98550 - WARN - - ACT  02jlpyiux70s 9ca086d19x7n cmd:greeter 9ca086d19x7n  As you can see, we are now outputting the transaction ID using the logger. We have  produced a WARN message instead of a simple console dump. From now on, we can  use Seneca log filters to hide the output of our actions in order to focus on what we  are trying to find.  [ 148 ]   Seneca provides the following five levels of logging:     DEBUG: This is used to debug applications when you are developing them   and also trace problems in production systems. INFO: This log level is used to produce important messages about events  such as a transaction has started or completed.         WARN: This is the warning level. We use it when something bad happens   in the system, but it is not critical, the user usually does not get affected;  however, it is an indication that something is going in the wrong way.     ERROR: This is used to log errors. Generally, the user gets affected by it and   it also interrupts the flow.     FATAL: This is the most catastrophic level. It is only used when a   non-recoverable error has occurred and the system won't be able to   function normally.  A way to produce logs in different levels is to use the associated functions. As we  have seen earlier, we called this.log.warn   to log a warning. If we call the this. log.fatal   method, we will be logging a fatal error, and same with the other levels.  Try to adjust the logs in your application as a part of the  development process or you will regret the lack of information  when something bad occurs in production.  In general, INFO, DEBUG, and WARN will be the most used log levels.  HTTP codes HTTP codes are often ignored, but they are a really important mechanism to  standardize responses from remote servers.  When a program  or user  issues a request to a server, there are a few things that  could happen, as follows:            It could be successful It could fail validation It could produce a server error  As you can see, the possibilities are endless. The problem that we now have is that  HTTP was created for the communication between machines. How do we handle the  fact that machines will be reading these codes?  [ 149 ]   HTTP solved this problem in a very elegant way: every single request has to be  resolved with an HTTP code and these codes have ranges that indicate the nature   of the code.  1xx – informational The codes in the 100-199 range are purely informational. The most interesting code in  this range is the 102 code. This code is used to specify that an operation is happening  in the background and might take some time to complete.  2xx – success codes Success codes are used to indicate a certain level of success in the HTTP request. It is  the most common  and desired  codes.  The most common codes in this range are as follows:     200: Success: This code indicates a full success. Nothing went wrong    even remotely.     201: Created: This code is used mainly for REST APIs when the client   requests to create a new entity in the server.     203: Non-authoritative information: This code is intended to be used  when, while routing the request through a transforming proxy, the origin  responds with a 200.     204: No Content: This is a successful code, but there is no content coming   back from the server. Sometimes, APIs returns 200, even if there is no content.    206: Partial Content: This code is used for paginated responses. A header   is sent, specifying a range  and an offset  that the client will accept. If the  response is bigger than the range, the server will reply with 206, indicating  that there is more data to follow.  3xx – redirection The codes in the 300 to 399 range indicate that the client must take some additional  actions to complete the request.  The most common codes in this range are described as follows:     301: Moved permanently: This status code is indicating that the resource   that the client was trying to get has been moved permanently to another  location.  [ 150 ]      302: Found: This code indicates that the user is required to perform a   temporary redirect for some reason, but the browsers started implementing  this code as 303 See Other. This lead to the introduction of the 303 and 307  Temporary redirect codes to disambiguate the overlap of behavior.     308 Permanent Redirect: This code, as the name indicates, is used to   specify a permanent redirect for a resource. It could be confused with 301,  but there is a small difference, the 308 code does not allow the HTTP method  to change.  4xx – client errors The codes in the 400 to 499 range represent errors generated by the client. They  indicate that there is a problem with the request. This range is particularly important  as it is the way that HTTP servers have to indicate the clients that something is  wrong with their request.  The common codes in this range are as follows:     400 Bad Request: This code indicates that the request from the user is   syntactically incorrect. There could be parameters missing or some of the  values didn't pass validation.     401 Unauthorized: This code represents a lack of authentication of the   client. Usually, a valid login will fix this problem.     403 Forbidden: This is similar to 401, but in this case, it is indicating that the   user does not have enough privileges.     404 Not Found: This means that the resource is not found in the server. This   is the error that you get when you navigate to a page that does not exist.  5xx – server errors This range indicates that there has been a processing error in the server. When a  5xx code is issued, it means that there was some sort of problem in the server and it  cannot be fixed from the client.  Some of the codes in this range are as follows:     500 Internal Server Error: This means that an error has occurred in the   software in the server. There is no more information disclosed.     501 Not Implemented: This error occurs when a client hits an endpoint that   has not been implemented yet.     503 Service unavailable: This code is issued when the server is not   available for some reason, either an excess of the load or the server is down.  [ 151 ]   Why HTTP codes matter in microservices The popular saying don't reinvent the wheel is one of my favorite principles when  building software. HTTP codes are a standard, so everybody understands the  consequences of the different codes.  When building microservices, you always need to keep in mind that your system  will be interacting with proxies, caches, and other services that already speak HTTP  so that they can react according to the response from the servers.  The best example of this is the circuit-breaker pattern. No matter how you  implement it and what software you use, a circuit breaker has to understand that an  HTTP request with 500 code is an error, so it can open the circuit accordingly.  In general, it is good practice to keep the codes of your application as accurate as  possible as it will benefit your system in the long run.  Summary In this chapter, you have learned how to build secure software  and not only  microservices , although it is a subject big enough to write a full book on it. The  problem with security is that companies usually see investing in security as burning  money, but that is far from reality. I am a big fan of the 80-20 rule: 20% of time will  give you 80% of features and the 20% of missing features will require 80% of the time.  In security, we really should be aiming for 100% coverage; however, the 80% shown  in this chapter will cover majority of the cases. Anyway, as I mentioned before, a  software engineer should be up to date with security as a flaw in the security of an  application is the easiest way to kill a company.  We have also been talking about traceability and logging, one of the most ignored  subjects in the modern software engineering that are becoming more and more  important, especially if your software is built using a microservices approach.  [ 152 ]   Testing and Documenting  Node.js Microservices  Until now, all that we have done is develop microservices and discuss the  frameworks around the process of building software components. Now it is time  to test all of them. Testing is the activity of validating the software that has been  built. Validating is a very broad term. In this chapter, we are going to learn how to  test microservices, not only from the functional point of view, but we will also learn  how to test the performance of our applications, as well as other aspects such as  integration with different modules. We will also build a proxy using Node.js to help  us to inspect the inputs and outputs of our services so that we can validate that what  we have designed is actually happening and, once again, reassure the versatility of a  language, such as JavaScript, to quickly prototype features.  It is also nowadays a trend to release features with an A B test, where we only  enable the features for certain type of users, and then we collect metrics to see  how the changes to our system are performing. In this chapter, we will build a  microservice that is going to give us the capability of rolling out features in a  controlled way.  On the other hand, we are going to document our application, which unfortunately,  is a forgotten activity in traditional software development: I haven't found a   single company where the documentation captures 100% the information needed   by new developers.  [ 153 ]   We will cover the following topics in this chapter:     Functional testing: In this section, we will learn how to test microservices  and what a good testing strategy is. We will also get to study a tool called  Postman to manually test our APIs, as well as build a proxy with Node.js to  spy our connections.     Documenting microservices: We will learn how to use Swagger to document   our microservices using the open API standard. We will also generate the  code from the YAML definition using an open source tool.  Functional testing Testing is usually a time-consuming activity that does not get all the required  attention while building a software.  Think about how a company evolves:  1.  Someone comes up with an idea. 2.  A few engineers product people build the system. 3.  The company goes to market.  There is no time to test more than the minimal required manual testing. Especially,  when someone reads on the Internet that testing done right could take up to 40% of  your development time, and once again, the common sense fails.  Automation is good and unit, integration, and end-to-end tests are a form of  automation. By letting a computer test our software, we are drastically cutting   down the human effort required to validate our software.  Think about how the software is developed. Even though our company likes to  claim that we are agile, the truth is that every single software project has some level  of iterative development, and testing is a part of every cycle, but generally, it is  overlooked in favour of delivering new features.  [ 154 ]   By automating the majority  or a big chunk  of the testing, we are saving money, as  shown in the following diagram:  Costs and Iterations  Testing is actually a cost saver if is done right, and the key is doing it right, which  is not always easy. How much testing is too much testing? Should we cover every  single corner of our application? Do we really need deep performance testing?  These questions usually lead to a different stream of opinions, and the interesting thing  is that there is not a single source of truth. It depends on the nature of your system.  In this chapter, we are going to learn a set of extensive testing techniques, which  does not mean that we should be including all of them in our test plan, but at least  we will be aware of the testing methodologies.  In the past seven years, Ruby on Rails has created a massive trend towards a new  paradigm, called Test-driven development  TDD , up to a point that, nowadays,  majority of the new development platforms are built with TDD in mind.  Personally, I am not a fierce adopter of TDD, but I like to take the good parts.  Planning the test before the development helps to create modules with the right level  of cohesion and define a clear and easy-to-test interface. In this chapter, we won't  cover the TDD in depth, but we will mention it a few times and explain how to apply  the exposed techniques to a TDD test plan.  [ 155 ]   The pyramid of automated testing How to lay down your testing plan is a tricky question. No matter what you do, you  will always end up with the sensation that this is completely wrong.  Before diving into the deep, let's define the different type of tests that we are   going to be dealing with from the functional point of view, and what should they   be designed for.  Unit tests A unit test is a test that covers individual parts of the application without taking into  account the integration with different modules. It is also called white box testing as  the aim is to cover and verify as many branches as possible.  Generally, the way to measure the quality of our tests is the test coverage and it is  measured in percentage. If our code spans over ten branches and our tests cover  seven branches, our code coverage is 70%. This is a good indication of how reliable  our test coverage is. However, it could be misleading as the tests could be flawed,  or even though all the branches are tested, a different input would cause a different  output that wasn't captured by a test.  In unit tests, as we don't interact with other modules, we will be making a heavy   use of mocks and stubs in order to simulate responses from third-party systems   and control the flow to hit the desired branch.  Integration tests Integration tests, as the name suggests, are the tests designed to verify the integration  of our module in the application environment. They are not designed to test the  branches of our code, but business units, where we will be saving the data into  databases, calling third-party web services or other microservices of our architecture.  These tests are the perfect tool for checking whether our service is behaving as  expected, and sometimes, could be hard to maintain  more often than not .  During my years of experience, I haven't found a company where the integration  testing is done right and there are a number of reasons for this, as stated in the  following list:     Some companies think that integration testing is expensive  and it is true  as   it requires extra resources  such as databases and extra machines   [ 156 ]      Some other companies try to cover all the business cases just with unit  testing, which depending on the business cases, could work, but it is far  from ideal as unit tests make assumptions  mocks  that could give us a false  confidence in our test suite     Sometimes, integration tests are used to verify the code branches as if they   were unit tests, which is time consuming as you need to work out the  environment to make the integration test to hit the required branch  No matter how smart you want to be, integration testing is something that you want  to do right, as it is the first real barrier in our software to prevent integration bugs  from being released into production.  End-to-end tests Here, we will demonstrate that our application actually works. In an integration  test, we are invoking the services at code level. This means that we need to build the  context of the service and then issue the call.  The difference with end-to-end testing is that, in end-to-end testing, we actually  fully deploy our application and issue the required calls to execute the target  code. However, many times, the engineers can decide to bundle both type of tests   integration and end-to-end tests  together, as the modern frameworks allow us to  quickly run E2E tests as if they were integration tests.  As the integration tests, the target of the end-to-end tests is not to test all the paths of  the application but test the use cases.  In end-to-end tests, we can find a few different modalities  paradigms  of testing,   as follows:     We can test our API issuing JSON requests  or other type of requests     We can test our UI using Selenium to emulate clicks on the DOM    We can use a new paradigm called behavior-driven development  BDD    testing, where the use cases are mapped into actions in our application  clicks  on the UI, requests in the API, and so on  and execute the use cases for which  the application was built  End-to-end tests are usually very fragile and they get broken fairly easy. Depending  on our application, we might get relaxed about these tests as the cost-value ratio is  pretty low, but still, I would recommend having some of them covering at least the  most basic and essential flows.  [ 157 ]   How much testing is too much? Questions such as the following are not easy to answer, especially in fast paced  businesses, like startups:     Do we have too many integration tests?    Should we aim for 100% unit test coverage?    Why bother with Selenium tests if they break every second day for no reason?  There is always a compromise. Test coverage versus time consumed, and also, there  is no simple and single answer to these questions.  The only useful guideline that I've found along the years is what the testing world  calls the pyramid of testing, which is shown in the following figure. If you think for  a moment, in the projects where you worked before, how many tests did you have  in total? What percentage of these were integration tests and unit tests? What about  end-to-end tests?:  The pyramid of testing  [ 158 ]   The preceding pyramid shows the answers for these questions. In a healthy test plan,  we should have a lot of unit tests: some integration tests and very few E2E tests.  The reason for this is very simple, majority of the problems can be caught within  unit testing. Hitting the different branches of our code will verify the functionality  of pretty much every functional case in our application, so it makes sense to have  plenty of them in our test plan. Based on my experience, in a balanced test plan,  around 70% of our tests should be unit tests. However, in a microservices-oriented  architecture, especially with a dynamic language such as Node.js, this figure can  easily go down and still be effective with our testing. The reasoning behind it is that  Node.js allows you to write integration tests very quickly so that we can replace  some unit tests by integration tests.  Testing is a very well-documented, complex process. Trying to  outsmart the existing methodologies could result in a hard-to-maintain  and difficult-to-trust test suite.  Integration tests are responsible for catching integration problems, as shown in   the following:     Can our code call the SMS gateway?    Would the connection to the database be OK?    Are the HTTP headers being sent from our service?  Again, around 20% of our tests, based on my experience, should be integration tests;  focus on the positive flows and some of the negative that depend on third-party  modules.  When it comes down to E2E tests, they should be very limited and only test the main  flows of the applications without going into too much detail. These details should be  already captured by the unit and integration tests that are easy to fix in an event of  failure. However, there is a catch here: when testing microservices in Node.js, 90%  of the time, integration and E2E tests can be the same thing. Due to the dynamic  nature of Node.js, we can test the rest API from the integration point of view  the full  server running , but in reality, we will also be testing how our code behaves when  integrated with other modules. We will see an example later in this chapter.  [ 159 ]   Testing microservices in Node.js Node.js is an impressive language. The amount of libraries around any single aspect  of the development is amazing. No matter how bizarre the task that you want to  achieve in Node.js is, there will be always an npm module.  Regarding the testing, Node.js has a very powerful set of libraries, but two of them  are especially popular: Mocha and Chai. They are pretty much the industry standard for app testing and are very well  maintained and upgraded. Another interesting library is called Sinon.JS, and it is used for mocking, spying and  stubbing methods. We will come back to these concepts in the following sections,  but this library is basically used to simulate integrations with third parties without  interacting with them.  Chai This library is a BDD TDD assertions library that can be used in conjunction with  any other library to create high quality tests.  An assertion is a code statement that will either be fulfilled or throw an error,  stopping the test and marking it as a failure:  5 should be equal to A  The preceding statement will be correct when the variable A contains the value 5. This  is a very powerful tool to write easy-to-understand tests, and especially with Chai, we  have access to assertions making use of the following three different interfaces:     should    expect    assert  Let's install the library:  npm install chai  At the end of the day, every single condition can be checked using a single interface,  but the fact that the library provides us with such a rich interface facilitates the  verbosity of the tests in order to write clean, easy, and maintainable tests.  [ 160 ]   This will produce the following output:  This means that Chai depends on assertion-error, type-detect, and deep-eql.  As you can see, this is a good indication that we will be able to check, with simple  instructions, complex statements such as deep equality in objects or type matching.  Testing libraries such as Chai are not a direct dependency of our application, but a  development dependency. We need them to develop applications, but they should  not be shipped to production. This is a good reason to restructure our package.json  and add Chai in the devDependencies dependency tag, as follows:  {   "name": "chai-test",   "version": "1.0.0",   "description": "A test script",   "main": "chai.js",   "dependencies": {   },   "devDependencies": {     "chai": "*"   },   "author": "David Gonzalez",   "license": "ISC" }  This will prevent our software to ship into production libraries such as Chai, which  has nothing to do with the operation of our application.  Once we have installed Chai, we can start playing around with the interfaces. BDD-style interfaces Chai comes with two flavors of BDD interfaces. It is a matter of preference which one  to use, but my personal recommendation is to use the one that makes you feel more  comfortable in any situation.  Let's start with the should Interface. This one is a BDD-style interface, using  something similar to the natural language, we can create assertions that will   decide whether our test succeeds or fails:  myVar.should.be.a 'string'   [ 161 ]   In order to be able to build sentences like the one before, we need to import the  should module in our program:  var chai = require 'chai' ;  chai.should  ;  var foo = "Hello world"; console.log foo ;  foo.should.equal 'Hello world' ;  Although it looks like a bit of dark magic, it is really convenient when testing our  code as we use something similar to the natural language to ensure that our code   is meeting some criteria: foo should be equal to 'Hello world' has a direct translation   to our test.  The second BDD-style interface provided by Chai is expect. Although it is very  similar to should, it changes a bit of syntax in order to set expectations that the  results have to meet.  Let's see the following example:  var expect = require 'chai' .expect;  var foo = "Hello world";  expect foo .to.equal "Hello world" ;  As you can see, the style is very similar: a fluent interface that allows us to check  whether the conditions for the test to succeed are met, but what happens if the  conditions are not met?  Let's execute a simple Node.js program that fails in one of the conditions:  var expect = require 'chai' .expect; var animals = ['cat', 'dog', 'parrot']; expect animals .to.have.length 4 ;  [ 162 ]   Now, let's execute the previous script, assuming that you have already installed Chai:  code node_modules chai lib chai assertion.js:107        throw new AssertionError msg, {              ^  AssertionError: expected [ 'cat', 'dog', 'parrot' ] to have a length of 4  but got 3      at Object.    Users dgonzalez Dropbox Microservices with  Node Writing Bundle Chapter 6 code chai.js:24:25       at Module._compile  module.js:460:26       at Object.Module._extensions..js  module.js:478:10       at Module.load  module.js:355:32       at Function.Module._load  module.js:310:12       at Function.Module.runMain  module.js:501:10       at startup  node.js:129:16       at node.js:814:3  An exception is thrown and the test fails. If all the conditions were validated, no  exception would have been raised and the test would have succeeded.  As you can see, there are a number of natural language words that we can use for  our tests using both expect and should interfaces. The full list can be found in the  Chai documentation  http:  chaijs.com api bdd -include-value- , but let's  explain some of the most interesting ones in the following list:     not: This word is used to negate the assertions following in the chain. For   example, expect "some string" .to.not.equal "Other String"    will pass.     deep: This word is one of the most interesting of all the collection. It is   used to deep-compare objects, which is the quickest way to carry on a full  equal comparison. For example, expect foo .to.deep.equal {name:  "David"}  will succeed if foo is a JavaScript object with one property called  name with the "David" string value.     any all: This is used to check whether the dictionary or object contains   any of the keys in the given list so that expect foo .to.have.any. keys "name", "surname"  will succeed if foo contains any of the given  keys, and expect foo .to.have.all.keys "name", "surname"  will only  succeed if it has all of the keys.  [ 163 ]      ok: This is an interesting one. As you probably know, JavaScript has a few   pitfalls, and one of them is the true false evaluation of expressions. With ok,  we can abstract all the mess and do something similar to the following list   of expressions:          expect 'everything' .to.be.ok: 'everything' is a string and it  will be evaluated to ok expect undefined .to.not.be.ok: Undefined is not ok in the  JavaScript world, so this assertion will succeed     above: This is a very useful word to check whether an array or collection   contains a number of elements above a certain threshold, as follows:  expect [1,2,3] .to.have.length.above 2   As you can see, the Chai API for fluent assertions is quite rich and enables us to write  very descriptive tests that are easy to maintain.  Now, you may be asking yourself, why have two flavors of the same interface that  pretty much work the same? Well, they functionally do the same, however, take a  look at the detail:     expect provides a starting point in your chainable language    should extends the Object.prototype signature to add the chainable   language to every single object in JavaScript  From Node.js' point of view, both of them are fine, although the fact that should is  instrumenting the prototype of Object could be a reason to be a bit paranoid about  using it as it is intrusive. Assertions interface The assertions interface matches the most common old-fashioned tests assertion  library. In this flavor, we need to be specific about what we want to test, and there   is no such thing as fluent chaining of expressions:  var assert = require 'chai' .assert; var myStringVar = 'Here is my string';    No message: assert.typeOf myStringVar, 'string' ;    With message: assert.typeOf myStringVar, 'string', 'myStringVar is not string     type.' ;    Asserting on length: assert.lengthOf myStringVar, 17 ;  [ 164 ]   There is really nothing more to go in depth if you have already used any of the  existing test libraries in any language.  Mocha Mocha is, in my opinion, one of the most convenient testing frameworks that I  have ever used in my professional life. It follows the principles of behavior-driven  development testing  BDDT , where the test describes a use case of the application  and uses the assertions from another library to verify the outcome of the executed  code.  Although it sounds a bit complicated, it is really convenient to ensure that our code is  covered from the functional and technical point of view, as we will be mirroring the  requirements used to build the application into automated tests that verifies them.  Let's start with a simple example. Mocha is a bit different from any other library, as  it defines its own domain-specific language  DSL  that needs to be executed with  Mocha instead of Node.js. It is an extension of the language.  First we need to install Mocha in the system:  npm install mocha -g  This will produce an output similar to the following image:  From now on, we have a new command in our system: mocha.  [ 165 ]   The next step is to write a test using Mocha:  function rollDice   {   return Math.floor Math.random   * 6  + 1; }  require 'chai' .should  ; var expect = require 'chai' .expect;  describe 'When a customer rolls a dice', function  {    it 'should return an integer number', function   {     expect rollDice   .to.be.an 'number' ;   } ;    it 'should get a number below 7', function  {     rollDice  .should.be.below 7 ;   } ;    it 'should get a number bigger than 0', function  {     rollDice  .should.be.above 0 ;   } ;    it 'should not be null', function   {     expect rollDice   .to.not.be.null;   } ;    it 'should not be undefined', function   {     expect rollDice   .to.not.be.undefined;   } ; } ;  The preceding example is simple. A function that rolls a dice and returns an   integer number from 1 to 6. Now we need to think a bit about the use cases   and the requirements:     The number has to be an integer    This integer has to be below 7       The function cannot return null    The function cannot return undefined  It has to be above 0, dice don't have negative numbers  [ 166 ]   This covers pretty much every corner case about rolling a dice in Node.js. What we  are doing is describing situations that we certainly want to test, in order to safely  make changes to the software without breaking the existing functionality.  These five use cases are an exact map to the tests written earlier:     We describe the situation: When a customer rolls a dice    Conditions get verified: It should return an integer number  Let's run the previous test and check the results:  mocha tests.js  This should return something similar to the following screenshot:  As you can see, Mocha returns a comprehensive report on what is going on in the  tests. In this case, all of them pass, so we don't need to be worried about problems.  Let's force some of the tests to fail:  function rollDice   {   return -1 * Math.floor Math.random   * 6  + 1; }  require 'chai' .should  ; var expect = require 'chai' .expect;  describe 'When a customer rolls a dice', function  {    it 'should return an integer number', function   {     expect rollDice   .to.be.an 'number' ;   } ;    it 'should get a number below 7', function  {  [ 167 ]       rollDice  .should.be.below 7 ;   } ;    it 'should get a number bigger than 0', function  {     rollDice  .should.be.above 0 ;   } ;    it 'should not be null', function   {     expect rollDice   .to.not.be.null;   } ;    it 'should not be undefined', function   {     expect rollDice   .to.not.be.undefined;   } ; } ;  Accidentally, someone has bumped a code fragment into the rollDice   function,  which makes the function return a number that does not meet some of the  requirements. Let's run Mocha again, as shown in the following image:  Now, we can see the report returning one error: the method is returning -4, where it  should always return a number bigger than 0.  Also, one of the benefits of this type of testing in Node.js using Mocha and Chai is  the time. Tests run very fast so that it is easy to receive feedback if we have broken  something. The preceding suite ran in 10ms.  [ 168 ]   Sinon.JS – a mocking framework The previous two chapters have been focused on asserting conditions on return  values of functions, but what happens when our function does not return any value?  The only correct measurement is to check whether the method was called or not.  Also, what if one of our modules is calling a third-party web service, but we don't  want our tests to call the remote server?  For answering these questions, we have two conceptual tools called mocks and spies,  and Node.js has the perfect library to implement them: Sinon.JS.  First install it, as follows:  npm install sinon  The preceding command should produce the following output:  Now let's explain how it works through an example:  function calculateHypotenuse x, y, callback  {   callback null, Math.sqrt x*x + y*x  ; }  calculateHypotenuse 3, 3, function err, result {   console.log result ; } ;  This simple script calculates the hypotenuse of a triangle, given the length of the  other two sides of the triangle. One of the tests that we want to carry on is the fact  that the callback is executed with the right list of arguments supplied. What we need  to accomplish such task is what Sinon.JS calls a spy:  var sinon = require 'sinon' ;  require 'chai' .should  ;  function calculateHypotenuse x, y, callback  {   callback null, Math.sqrt x*x + y*x  ; }  describe "When the user calculates the hypotenuse", function  {  [ 169 ]     it "should execute the callback passed as argument", function   {     var callback = sinon.spy  ;     calculateHypotenuse 3, 3, callback ;     callback.called.should.be.true;   } ; } ;  Once again, we are using Mocha to run the script and Chai to verify the results in the  test through the should interface, as shown in the following image:  The important line in the preceding script is:  var callback = sinon.spy  ;  Here, we are creating the spy and injecting it into the function as a callback. This  function created by Sinon.JS is actually not only a function, but a full object with a  few interesting points of information. Sinon.JS does that, taking advantage of the  dynamic nature of JavaScript. You can actually see what is in this object by dumping  it into the console with console.log  . Another very powerful tool in Sinon.JS are the stubs. Stubs are very similar to mocks   identical at practical effects in JavaScript  and allow us to fake functions to simulate  the required return:  var sinon = require 'sinon' ; var expect = require 'chai' .expect;  function rollDice   {   return -1 * Math.floor Math.random   * 6  + 1; } describe "When rollDice gets called", function   {   it "Mathrandom should be called with no arguments", function   {     sinon.stub Math, "random" ;     rollDice  ;     console.log Math.random.calledWith   ;   } ; }   [ 170 ]   In this case, we have stubbed the Mathrandom method, which causes the method to  be some sort of overloaded empty function  it does not issue the get call  that records  stats on what or how it was called.  There is one catch in the preceding code: we never restored the random   method  back and this is quite dangerous. It has a massive side effect, as other tests will see  the Mathrandom method as a stub, not as the original one, and it can lead to us  coding our tests according to invalid information.  In order to prevent this, we need to make use of the before   and after   methods  from Mocha:  var sinon = require 'sinon' ; var expect = require 'chai' .expect;  var sinon = require 'sinon' ; var expect = require 'chai' .expect;  function rollDice   {   return -1 * Math.floor Math.random   * 6  + 1; } describe "When rollDice gets called", function   {      it "Mathrandom should be called with no arguments", function   {     sinon.stub Math, "random" ;     rollDice  ;     console.log Math.random.calledWith   ;   } ; after function  {     Math.random.restore  ;   } ; } ;  If you pay attention to the highlighted code, we are telling Sinon.JS to restore   the original method that was stubbed inside one of the it blocks, so that if   another describe block makes use of http.get, we won't see the stub, but   the original method.  The before   and after   methods are very helpful to set up and  wind down the context for the tests. However, you need to be careful with  the scope where they are executed as it could lead to test interactions.  [ 171 ]   Mocha has a few flavors of before and after:     before callback : This is executed before the current scope  at the   beginning of the describe block in the preceding code      after callback : This is executed after the current scope  at the end of the   describe block in the preceding code      beforeEach callback : This is executed at the beginning of every element   in the current scope  before each it in the preceding example      afterEach callback : This is executed at the end of every element in the   current scope  after every it in the preceding example   Another interesting feature in Sinon.JS is the time manipulation. Some of the  tests need to execute periodic tasks or respond after a certain time of an event's  occurrence. With Sinon.JS, we can dictate time as one of the parameters of our tests:  var sinon = require 'sinon' ; var expect = require 'chai' .expect  function areWeThereYet callback  {      setTimeout function   {     callback.apply this ;   }, 10 ;    }  var clock;  before function  {   clock = sinon.useFakeTimers  ; } ;  it "callback gets called after 10ms", function    {   var callback = sinon.spy  ;   var throttled = areWeThereYet callback ;    areWeThereYet callback ;    clock.tick 9 ;   expect callback.notCalled .to.be.true;      clock.tick 1 ;  [ 172 ]     expect callback.notCalled .to.be.false; } ;  after function  {   clock.restore  ; } ;  As you can see, we can now control the time in our tests.  Testing a real microservice Now, it is time to test a real microservice in order to get a general picture of the full  test suite.  Our microservice is going to use Express, and it will filter an input text to remove  what the search engines call stop words: words with less than three characters and words  that are banned.  Let's see the code:  var _ = require 'lodash' ; var express = require 'express' ;  var bannedWords = ["kitten", "puppy", "parrot"];  function removeStopWords  text, callback  {   var words = text.split ' ' ;   var validWords = [];   _ words .forEach function word, index  {     var addWord = true;          if  word.length < 3  {       addWord = false;     }          if addWord && bannedWords.indexOf word  > -1  {       addWord = false;     }          if  addWord  {       validWords.push word ;      }             Last iteration:     if  index ==  words.length - 1   {  [ 173 ]         callback null, validWords.join " "  ;     }   } ; } var app = express  ;  app.get ' filter', function req, res  {   removeStopWords req.query.text, function err, response {     res.send response ;   } ; } ;  app.listen 3000, function   {   console.log "app started in port 3000" ; } ;  As you can see, the service is pretty small, so it is the perfect example for explaining  how to write unit, integration, and E2E tests. In this case, as we stated before, E2E  and integration tests are going to be the exact same as testing the service through the  REST API will be equivalent to testing the system from the end-to-end point of view,  but also how our component is integrated within the system. Given that, if we were  to add a UI, we would have to split integration tests from E2E in order to ensure   the quality. TDD – Test-driven development Our service is done and working. However, now we want to unit test it, but we find  some problems:     The function that we want to unit test is not visible outside the main .js file    The server code is tightly coupled to the functional code and has bad cohesion  Here TDD comes to the rescue; we should always ask ourselves "how am I going to  test this function when writing software?" It does not mean that we should modify  our software with the specific purpose of testing, but if you are having problems  while testing a part of your program, more than likely, you should look into   cohesion and coupling, as it is a good indication of problems. Let's take a look   at the following file:  var _ = require 'lodash' ; var express = require 'express' ;  module.exports = function options  {  [ 174 ]     bannedWords = [];   if  typeof options !== 'undefined'  {     console.log options ;     bannedWords = options.bannedWords  [];   }    return function bannedWords text, callback  {     var words = text.split ' ' ;     var validWords = [];     _ words .forEach function word, index  {       var addWord = true;              if  word.length < 3  {         addWord = false;       }              if addWord && bannedWords.indexOf word  > -1  {         addWord = false;       }              if  addWord  {         validWords.push word ;        }                 Last iteration:       if  index ==  words.length - 1   {         callback null, validWords.join " "  ;       }     } ;   } }  This file is a module that, in my opinion, is highly reusable and has good cohesion:     We can import it everywhere  even in a browser     The banned words can be injected when creating the module  very useful    for testing  It is not tangled with the application code      [ 175 ]   Laying down the code this way, our application module will look similar to the  following:  var _ = require 'lodash' ; var express = require 'express' ;  var removeStopWords = require '. remove-stop-words'  {bannedWords:     ["kitten", "puppy", "parrot"]} ;  var app = express  ;  app.get 'filter', function req, res  {   res.send removeStopWords req.query.text  ; } ;  app.listen 3000, function   {   console.log "app started in port 3000" ; } ;  As you can see, we have clearly separated the business unit  the function that  captures the business logic  from the operational unit  the setup of the server .  As I mentioned before, I am not a big fan of writing the tests prior to the code, but  they should be written  in my opinion  alongside the code, but always having in  mind the question mentioned before.  There seem to be a push in companies to adopt a TDD methodology, but it could  lead to a significant inefficiency, especially if the business requirements are unclear   as they are 90% of the time  and we face changes along the development process. Unit testing Now that our code is in a better shape, we are going to unit test our function. We will  use Mocha and Chai to accomplish such task:  var removeStopWords = require '. remove-stop-words'  {bannedWords:     ["kitten", "parrot"]} ;  var chai = require 'chai' ; var assert = chai.assert; chai.should  ; var expect = chai.expect;  describe 'When executing "removeStopWords"', function   {      it 'should remove words with less than 3 chars of length',       function   {  [ 176 ]       removeStopWords 'my small list of words', function err,         response  {       expect response .to.equal "small list words" ;     } ;   } ;      it 'should remove extra white spaces', function   {     removeStopWords 'my small       list of words', function err,         response  {       expect response .to.equal "small list words" ;     } ;   } ;      it 'should remove banned words', function   {     removeStopWords 'My kitten is sleeping', function err,         response  {       expect response .to.equal "sleeping" ;     } ;   } ;      it 'should not fail with null as input', function   {     removeStopWords null, function err, response  {       expect response .to.equal "small list words" ;     } ;   } ;      it 'should fail if the input is not a string', function   {     try {       removeStopWords 5, function err, response  {} ;       assert.fail  ;     }     catch err  {     }   } ; } ;  As you can see, we have covered pretty much every single case and branch inside  our application, but how is our code coverage looking?  [ 177 ]   Until now, we have mentioned it, but never actually measured it. We are going to  use one tool, called Istanbul, to measure the test coverage:  npm install -g istanbul  This should install Istanbul. Now we need to run the coverage report:  istanbul cover _mocha my-tests.js  This will produce an output similar to the one shown in the following image:  This will also generate a coverage report in HTML, pointing out which lines, functions,  branches, and statements are not being covered, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 178 ]   As you can see, we are looking pretty well. Our code  not the tests  is actually well  covered, especially if we look into the detailed report for our code file, as shown in  the following image:     We can see that only one branch  the or operator in line 7  is not covered and the if  operator in line 6 never diverted to the else operator.  [ 179 ]   We also got information about the number of times a line is executed: it is showing  in the vertical bar beside the line number. This information is also very useful to spot  the hot areas of our application where an optimization will benefit the most.  Regarding the right level of coverage, in this example, it is fairly easy to go up to  90%+, but unfortunately, it is not that easy in production systems:     Code is a lot more complex    Time is always a constraint    Testing might not be seen as productive time  However, you should exercise caution when working with a dynamic language. In  Java or C, calling a function that does not exist results in a compilation time error;  whereas in JavaScript, it will result in a runtime error. The only real barrier is the  testing  manual or automated , so it is a good practice to ensure that at least every  line is executed once. In general code coverage, over 75% should be good enough for  the majority of cases. End-to-end testing In order to test our application end to end, we are going to need a server running  it. Usually, end-to-end tests are executed against a controlled environment, such  as a QA box or a pre-production machine, to verify that our about-to-be-deployed  software is behaving as expected.  In this case, our application is an API, so we are going to create the end-to-end tests,  which at the same time, are going to be used as integration tests.  However, in a full application, we might want to have a clear separation between  the integration and end-to-end tests and use something like Selenium to test our  application from the UI point of view.  Selenium is a framework that allows our code to send instructions to the browser,   as follows:     Click the button with the button1 ID    Hover over the div element with the CSS class highlighted  In this way, we can ensure that our app flows work as expected, end to end, and our  next release is not going to break the key flows of our app.  [ 180 ]   Let's focus on the end-to-end tests for our microservice. We have been using Chai  and Mocha with their corresponding assertion interfaces to unit test our software,  and Sinon.JS to mock services functions and other elements to avoid the calls being  propagated to third-party web services or get a controlled response from one method.  Now, in our end-to-end test plan, we actually want to issue the calls to our service  and get the response to validate the results.  The first thing we need to do is run our microservice somewhere. We are going  to use our local machine just for convenience, but we can execute these tests in a  continuous development environment against a QA machine.  So, let's start the server:  node stop-words.js  I call my script stop-words.js for convenience. Once the server is running, we   are ready to start testing. In some situations, we might want our test to start and stop  the server so that everything is self-contained. Let's see a small example about how  to do it:  var express = require 'express' ;  var myServer = express  ;  var chai = require 'chai' ;  myServer.get ' endpoint', function req, res {   res.send 'endpoint reached' ; } ;  var serverHandler;  before function  {   serverHandler = myServer.listen 3000 ; } ;  describe "When executing 'GET' into  endpoint", function  {   it "should return 'endpoint reached'", function  {        Your test logic here. http:  localhost:3000 is your server.   } ; } ;  after function  {   serverHandler.close  ; } ;  [ 181 ]   As you can see, Express provides a handler to operate the server programmatically, so  it is as simple as making use of the before   and after   functions to do the trick.  In our example, we are going to assume that the server is running. In order to   issue the requests, we are going to use a library called request to issue the calls   to the server.  The way to install it, as usual, is to execute npm install request. Once it is  finished, we can make use of this amazing library:  var chai = require 'chai' ; var chaiHttp = require 'chai-http' ; var expect = chai.expect; chai.use chaiHttp ;  describe "when we issue a 'GET' to  filter with text='aaaa bbbb     cccc'", function  {   it "should return HTTP 200", function done  {     chai.request 'http:  localhost:3000'        .get ' filter'        .query {text: 'aa bb ccccc'} .end function req, res {         expect res.status .to.equal 200 ;         done  ;       } ;   } ; } ;  describe "when we issue a 'GET' to  filter with text='aa bb     ccccc'", function  {   it "should return 'ccccc'", function done  {     chai.request 'http:  localhost:3000'        .get ' filter'        .query {text: 'aa bb ccccc'} .end function req, res {         expect res.text .to.equal 'ccccc' ;         done  ;       } ;   } ; } ;  describe "when we issue a 'GET' to  filter with text='aa bb cc'",     function  {   it "should return ''", function done  {     chai.request 'http:  localhost:3000'        .get ' filter'        .query {text: 'aa bb cc'} .end function req, res {  [ 182 ]           expect res.text .to.equal '' ;         done  ;       } ;   } ; } ;  With the simple test from earlier, we managed to test our server in a way that  ensures that every single mobile part of the application has been executed.  There is a particularity here that we didn't have before:    it "should return 'ccccc'", function done  {     chai.request 'http:  localhost:3000'        .get ' filter'        .query {text: 'aa bb ccccc'} .end function req, res {         expect res.text .to.equal 'ccccc' ;         done  ;       } ;   } ;  If you take a look at the highlighted code, you can see a new callback called done.  This callback has one mission: prevent the test from finishing until it is called, so  that the HTTP request has time to be executed and return the appropriated value.  Remember, Node.js is asynchronous, there is no such thing as a thread being blocked  until one operation finishes.  Other than that, we are using a new DSL introduced by chai-http to build   get requests.  This language allows us to build a large range of combinations, consider the  following, for example:  chai.request 'http:  mydomain.com'    .post ' myform'    .field '_method', 'put'    .field 'username', 'dgonzalez'    .field 'password', '123456' .end ...   In the preceding request, we are submitting a form that looks like a login, so that in  the end   function, we can assert the return from the server.  There are an endless number of combinations to test our APIs with chai-http.  [ 183 ]   Manual testing – the necessary evil No matter how much effort we put in to our automated testing, there will always be  a number of manual tests executed.  Sometimes, we need to do it just when we are developing our API, as we want to   see the messages going from our client to the server, but some other times, we just  want to hit our endpoints with a pre-forged request to cause the software to execute  as we expect.  In the first case, we are going to take the advantage of Node.js and its dynamic  nature to build a proxy that will sniff all the requests and log them to a terminal  so that we can debug what is going on. This technique can be used to leverage  the communication between two microservices and see what is going on without  interrupting the flow.  In the second case, we are going to use software called Postman to issue requests  against our server in a controlled way. Building a proxy to debug our microservices My first contact with Node.js was exactly due to this problem: two servers sending  messages to each other, causing misbehavior without an apparent cause.  It is a very common problem that has many already-working solutions  man-in-the- middle proxies basically , but we are going to demonstrate how powerful Node.js is:  var http = require 'http' ; var httpProxy = require 'http-proxy' ; var proxy = httpProxy.createProxyServer {} ;  http.createServer function req, res  {   console.log req.rawHeaders ;   proxy.web req, res, { target: 'http:  localhost:3000' } ; } .listen 4000 ;  If you remember from the previous section, our stop-words.js program was  running on the port 3000. What we have done with this code is create a proxy using  http-proxy, that tunnels all the requests made on the port 4000 into the port 3000  after logging the headers into the console.  If we run the program after installing all the dependencies with the npm install  command in the root of the project, we can see how effectively the proxy is logging  the requests and tunneling them into the target host:  curl http:  localhost:4000 filter?text=aaa  [ 184 ]   This will produce the following output:  This example is very simplistic, but this small proxy could virtually be deployed  anywhere in between our microservices and give us very valuable information about  what is going on in the network. Postman Out of all the software that we can find on the Internet for testing APIs, Postman is  my favorite. It started as a extension for Google Chrome, but nowadays, has taken  the form of a standalone app built on the Chrome runtime.  It can be found in the Chrome web store, and it is free  so you don't need to pay for  it , although it has a version for teams with more advanced features that is paid.  The interface is very concise and simple, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 185 ]   On the left-hand side, we can see the History of requests, as well as the Collections  of requests, which will be very handy for when we are working on a long-term  project and we have some complicated requests to be built.  We are going to use again our stop-words.js microservice to show how powerful  Postman can be.  Therefore, the first thing is to make sure that our microservice is running. Once it is,  let's issue a request from Postman, as shown in the following screenshot:  As simple as that, we have issued the request for our service  using the GET verb   and it has replied with the text filtered: very simple and effective.  [ 186 ]   Now imagine that we want to execute that call over Node.js. Postman comes with a  very interesting feature, which is generating the code for the requests that we issue  from the interface. If you click on the icon under the save button on the right-hand  side of the window, the appearing screen will do the magic:  Let's take a look at the generated code:  var http = require "http" ;  var options = {   "method": "GET",   "hostname": "localhost",   "port": "3000",   "path": " filter?text=aaa%20bb%20cc",   "headers": {     "cache-control": "no-cache",     "postman-token": "912cacd8-bcc0-213f-f6ff-f0bcd98579c0"   } };  var req = http.request options, function  res  {  [ 187 ]     var chunks = [];    res.on "data", function  chunk  {     chunks.push chunk ;   } ;    res.on "end", function    {     var body = Buffer.concat chunks ;     console.log body.toString   ;   } ; } ;  req.end  ;  It is quite an easy code to understand, especially if you are familiar with the   HTTP library.  With Postman, we can also send cookies, headers, and forms to the servers in  order to mimic the authentication that an application will fulfill by sending the  authentication token or cookie across.  Let's redirect our request to the proxy that we created in the preceding section, as  shown in the following screenshot:  [ 188 ]   If you have the proxy and the stop-words.js microservice running, you should see  something similar to the following output in the proxy:  The header that we sent over with Postman, my-awesome-header, will show up in  the list of raw headers.  Documenting microservices In this section, we are going to learn how to use Swagger to document APIs.   Swagger is an API manager that follows the Open API standard, so that it is a  common language for all the API creators. We will discuss how to write definitions  and why it is so important to agree on how to describe resources.  Documenting APIs with Swagger Documentation is always a problem. No matter how hard you try, it will always  eventually go out of date. Luckily, in the past few years, there has been a push into  producing a high quality documentation for REST APIs.  API managers have played a key role in it, and Swagger is particularly an interesting  platform to look at. More than a module for documentation, Swagger manages your  API in a such way that gives you a holistic view of your work.  Let's start installing it:  npm install -g swagger  [ 189 ]   This will install Swagger system-wide, so it will be another command in our system.  Now, we need to create a project using it:  swagger project create my-project  This command will allow you to choose different web frameworks. We are going to  choose Express, as it is the one that we have already been using. The output of the  preceding command is shown in the following screenshot:  This screenshot is showing how to start a project with Swagger  [ 190 ]   Now we can find a new folder, called my-project, that looks like the following image:  The structure is self-explanatory and it is the common layout of a Node.js application:     api: Here, our API code will lay down    config: All the configuration sits in here    node_modules: This is a folder with all the dependencies required to run       test: This is where Swagger has generated some dummy tests and where we   our application  could add our own tests  Swagger comes with an impressive feature: an embedded editor that allows you  to model the endpoints of your API. In order to run it, from within the generated  folder, execute the following command:  Swagger project edit  [ 191 ]   It will open Swagger Editor in the default browser, with a window similar to the  following image:  Swagger makes use of Yet Another Markup Language  YAML . It is a language that  is very similar to JSON, but with a different syntax. In this document, we can customize a number of things, such as paths  routes in our  application . Let's take a look at the path generated by Swagger:   hello:    binds a127 app logic to a route   x-swagger-router-controller: hello_world   get:     description: Returns 'Hello' to the caller      used as the method name of the controller     operationId: hello     parameters:       - name: name  [ 192 ]           in: query         description: The name of the person to whom to say hello         required: false         type: string     responses:       "200":         description: Success         schema:            a pointer to a definition           $ref: " definitions HelloWorldResponse"        responses may fall through to errors       default:         description: Error         schema:           $ref: " definitions ErrorResponse"  The definition is self-documented. Basically, we will configure the parameters used  by our endpoint, but in a declarative way. This endpoint is mapping the incoming  actions into the hello_world controller, and specifically into the hello method,  which is defined by the id operation. Let's see what Swagger has generated for us in  this controller:  'use strict';  var util = require 'util' ;  module.exports = {   hello: hello };  function hello req, res  {   var name = req.swagger.params.name.value  'stranger';   var hello = util.format 'Hello, %s!', name ;   res.json hello ; }  This code can be found in the api controllers folder of the project. As you can  see, it is a pretty standard Express controller packed as a module  well-cohesioned .  The only strange line is the first one in the hello function, where we pick up the  parameters from Swagger. We will come back to this later, once we run the project.  [ 193 ]   The second part of the endpoint is the responses. As we can see, we are referencing  two definitions: HelloWorldResponse for http code 200 and ErrorResponse for  the rest of the codes. These objects are defined in the following code:  definitions:   HelloWorldResponse:     required:       - message     properties:       message:         type: string   ErrorResponse:     required:       - message     properties:       message:         type: string  This is something really interesting, although we are using a dynamic language, the  contract is being defined by Swagger so that we have a language-agnostic definition  that can be consumed by a number of different technologies, respecting the principle of  technology heterogeneity that we were talking about earlier in Chapter 1, Microservices  Architecture, and Chapter 2, Microservices in Node.js – Seneca and PM2 Alternatives.  After explaining how the definition works, it is time to start the server:  swagger project start  This should produce an output that is very similar to the following code:  Starting: C:\my-project\app.js...    project started here: http:  localhost:10010     project will restart on changes.    to restart at any time, enter `rs`  try this:  curl http:  127.0.0.1:10010 hello?name=Scott  [ 194 ]   Now, if we follow the instructions of the output and execute the curl command, we  get the following output:  curl http:  127.0.0.1:10010 hello?name=David  "Hello David!"  Swagger is binding the name query parameter to the Swagger parameter specified  in the YAML definition. This may sound bad, as we are coupling our software  to Swagger, but it gives you an immense benefit: Swagger allows you to test the  endpoint through the editor. Let's see how it works. On the right-hand side of the editor, you can see a button with the Try this operation  label, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 195 ]   Once you click it, it will present you a form that allows you to test the endpoint, as  shown in the following screenshot:  There is a warning message on this form about cross-origin requests. We don't need  to worry about it when developing in our local machine; however, we could have  problems when testing other hosts using the Swagger Editor.  For more information, visit the following URL: https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Cross-origin_ resource_sharing  [ 196 ]   Enter a value for the name parameter, and after that, click on Send Request, as  shown in the following image:  This is a response example using Swagger Editor to test the endpoint  Be aware that, for this test to work, our app server has to be up and running.  Generating a project from the Swagger  definition Until now, we have been playing with Swagger and the generated project, but we are  now going to generate the project from the swagger.yaml file. We will use the already  generated project as a starting point, but we will add a new endpoint:  swagger: "2.0" info:   version: "0.0.1"   title: Stop Words Filtering App host: localhost:8000 basePath:   schemes:   - http   - https  [ 197 ]   consumes:   - application json produces:   - application json paths:    stop-words:     x-swagger-router-controller: stop_words     get:       description: Removes the stop words from an arbitrary input           text.       operationId: stopwords       parameters:         - name: text           in: query           description: The text to be sanitized           required: false           type: string       responses:         "200":           description: Success           schema:             $ref: " definitions StopWordsResponse"    swagger:     x-swagger-pipe: swagger_raw definitions:   StopWordsResponse:     required:       - message     properties:       message:         type: string  This endpoint might sound very familiar to you, as we unit tested it earlier in this  chapter. As you probably know by now, the Swagger Editor is quite cool: it provides  feedback as you type on, about what is going on in the YAML file, as well as saves  the changes.  The next step is to download the Swagger code generator from https:  github. com swagger-api swagger-codegen. It is a Java project, so we are going to need   the Java SDK and Maven to build it, as follows:  mvn package  [ 198 ]   Codegen is a tool that allow us to read the API definition from the Swagger YAML   and build the basic structure for a project in a language of our choice, in this case,  Node.js.  The preceding command in the root of the project should build all the submodules.  Now, it is as easy as executing the following command in the root of the swagger- codegen folder:  java -jar modules swagger-codegen-cli target swagger-codegen-cli.jar  generate -i my-project.yaml -l nodejs -o my-project  The Swagger code generator supports a number of languages. Here, the trick is that  when using it for microservices, we can define the interface and then use the most  appropriate technology to build our service.  If you go to the my-project folder, you should find the full structure of the project in  there, ready to start coding.  Summary In this chapter, you learned how to test and document microservices. It is usually  the forgotten activity in software development, due to the pressures to deliver new  functionalities, but in my opinion, it is a risky decision. We have to find the balance  between too much and very little testing. In general, we will always try to find the  right proportion for unit, integration and end-to-end tests.  You also learned about manual testing and the tools to efficiently test our software  manually  there is always a component of manual testing .  Another interesting point is the documentation and API management. In this case,  we got to know Swagger, which is probably the most popular API manager that led  to the creation of the Open API standard.  If you want to go deeper in to the API world  there is a lot to learn in order to build  a practical and efficient API , you should probably browse http:  apigee.com.  Apigee are a company expert on building APIs and providing tools for developers  and enterprises that could help you to build a better API.  [ 199 ]    Monitoring Microservices  Monitoring servers is always a controversial subject. It usually falls under system  administration, and software engineers don't even go near it, but we are losing one  of the huge benefits of monitoring: the ability to react quickly to failures. By monitoring  our system very closely, we can be aware of problems almost immediately so that  the actions to correct the problem may even save us from impacting the customers.  Along with monitoring, there is the concept of performance. By knowing how our  system behaves during load periods, we will be able to anticipate the necessity of  scaling the system. In this chapter, we will discuss how to monitor servers, and  specifically microservices, in order to maintain the stability of our system.  In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:     Monitoring services    Monitoring using PM2 and Keymetrics    Monitoring metrics    Simian Army – the active monitoring from Spotify    Throughput and performance degradation  Monitoring services When monitoring a microservice, we are interested in a few different types   of metrics. The first big group of metrics is the hardware resources, which are  described as follows:     Memory metrics: This indicates how much memory is left in our system or   consumed by our application     CPU utilization: As the name suggests, this indicates how much CPU are we   using at a given time     Disk utilization: This indicates the I O pressure in the physical hard drives  [ 201 ]   The second big group is the application metrics, as follows:     Number of errors per time unit    Number of calls per time unit    Response time  Even though both groups are connected and a problem in the hardware will impact  the application performance  and the other way around , knowing all of them is   a must.  Hardware metrics are easy to query if our server is a Linux machine. On Linux,  all the magic of hardware resources happens in the  proc folder. This folder is  maintained by the kernel of the system and contains files about how the system  behaves regarding a number of aspects in the system. Software metrics are harder to collect and we are going to use Keymetrics from the  creators of PM2 to monitor our Node.js applications.  Monitoring using PM2 and Keymetrics PM2, as we've seen before, is a very powerful instrument to run Node applications,  but it is also very good at monitoring standalone applications in production servers.  However, depending on your business case, it is not always easy to get access to   the production.  The creators of PM2 have solved this problem by creating Keymetrics. Keymetrics   is a Software as a service  SaaS  component that allows PM2 to send monitoring  data across the network to its website, as shown in the following image  as found   at https:  keymetrics.io  :  [ 202 ]   Even though Keymetrics is not free, it provides a free tier to demonstrate how it  works. We are going to use it in this chapter.  The very first thing that we need to do is register a user. Once we get access to our  account, we should see something similar to the following screen:  This screen is asking us to create a bucket. Keymetrics uses the bucket concept to  define a context. For example, if our organization has different areas  payments,  customer service, and so on  with different servers on each area, we could monitor  all the servers in one bucket. There are no restrictions on how many servers you can  have in one bucket. It is even possible to have all the organization in the same bucket  so that everything is easy to access.  [ 203 ]   Let's create a bucket called Monitoring Test, as shown in the following image:  Easy, once we tap on Create Bucket, Keymetrics will show us a screen with the  information needed to start monitoring our app, as shown in the following image:  [ 204 ]   As you can see, the screen displays information about the private key used by  Keymetrics. Usually, it is a very bad idea to share this key with anyone.  As shown on the screen, the next step is to configure PM2 to push data into  Keymetrics. There is also useful information about the networking needed   to make Keymetrics work:     PM2 will be pushing data to the port 80 on Keymetrics    Keymetrics will be pushing data back to us on the port 43554  Usually, in large organizations, there are restrictions about the networking, but if  you are testing this from home, everything should work straightaway.  In order to make PM2 able to send metrics to Keymetrics, we need to install one PM2  module called pm2-server-monit. This is a fairly easy task:  pm2 install pm2-server-monit  This will result in an output similar to the following:  Let's run the advised command:  pm2 link fan7p32fnysuuw8 znlz25frrcwakg6 my-server  [ 205 ]   In this case, I have replaced [server name] with my-server. There are no  restrictions on the server name; however, when rolling out Keymetrics into a real  system, it is recommended to choose a descriptive name in order to easily identify  the server in the dashboard.  The preceding command will produce an output similar to the following image:  This is an indication that everything went well and our application is ready to be  monitored from Keymetrics that can be checked on https:  app.keymetrics.io ,  as follows:  Now, our server is showing up in the interface. As we previously stated, this bucket  could monitor different servers. A simple virtual machine is created, and as you can  see at the bottom of the screen, Keymetrics provides us with the command to be  executed in order to add another server. In this case, as we are using the free access  to Keymetrics, so we can only monitor one server.  Let's see what Keymetrics can offer us. At first sight, we can see interesting metrics  such as CPU usage, memory available, disk available, and so on.  [ 206 ]   All these are hardware metrics that indicate how our system is behaving. Under  pressure, they are the perfect indicator to point out the need for more hardware  resources.  Usually, the hardware resources are the main indicator of failure in an application.  Now, we are going to see how to use Keymetrics to diagnose the problem.  Diagnosing problems A memory leak is usually a difficult problem to solve due to the nature of the flaw.  Take a look at the following code.  Let's run the program using a simple seneca.act   action:  var seneca = require 'seneca'   ;  var names = [];  seneca.add {cmd: 'memory-leak'}, function args, done {   names.push args.name ;   greetings = "Hello " + args.name;   done null ,{result: greetings} ; } ;  seneca.act {cmd: 'memory-leak', name: 'David'}, function err,     response  {   console.log response ; } ;  This program has a very obvious memory leak, and by obvious, I mean that it  is written to be obvious. The names array will keep growing indefinitely. In the  preceding example, it is not a big deal due to the fact that our application is a   script that will start and finish without keeping the state in memory.  Remember that JavaScript allocates variables in the  global scope if the var keyword is not used.  The problem comes when someone else reutilizes our code in a different part of   the application.  [ 207 ]   Let's assume that our system grows to a point that we need a microservice to greet  new customers  or deliver the initial payload of personal information such as name,  preferences, configuration, and so on . The following code could be a good example  on how to build it:  var seneca = require 'seneca'   ;  var names = [];  seneca.add {cmd: 'memory-leak'}, function args, done {   names.push args.name ;   greetings = "Hello " + args.name;   done null ,{result: greetings} ; } ;  seneca.listen null, {port: 8080} ;  In this example, Seneca will be listening over HTTP for requests from Seneca clients  or other types of systems such as curl. When we run the application:  node index.js  2016-02-14T13:30:26.748Z szwj2mazorea 1455456626740 40489 - INFO hello  Seneca 1.1.0 szwj2mazorea 1455456626740 40489 -  2016-02-14T13:30:27.003Z szwj2mazorea 1455456626740 40489 - INFO listen  {port:8080}  Then from another terminal, we use curl to act as a client of our microservice,  everything will work smoothly and our memory leak will go unnoticed:  curl -d '{"cmd": "memory-leak", "name":"David"}' http:  127.0.0.1:8080  act  {"result":"Hello David"}%  However, we are going to use Keymetrics to find the problem. The first thing we  need to do is run our program using PM2. In order to do it so, we run the following  command:  pm2 start index.js  [ 208 ]   This command will produce the following output:  Let's explain the output in the following:         The first line gives us information about the integration with Keymetrics.  Data such as public key, server name, and the URL to access Keymetrics. In the first table, we can see the name of the application running, as well as  few statistics on memory, uptime, CPU, and so on. In the second table, we can see the information relevant to the pm2-server- monit PM2 module.      Now, let's go to Keymetrics and see what has happened:  The application is now registered in Keymetrics as it can be seen in the control panel  [ 209 ]   As you can see, now our application is showing up in Keymetrics.  Straightaway, we can see the very useful things about our app. One of these is the  memory used. This is the metric that will indicate a memory leak, as it will keep  growing.  Now, we are going to force the memory leak to cause a problem in our application.  In this case, the only thing that we need to do is start our server  the small  application that we wrote before  and issue a significant number of requests:  for i in {0..100000} do   curl -d '{"cmd": "memory-leak", "name":"David"}'       http:  127.0.0.1:8080 act done  As simple as the small bash script, this is all it takes to open Pandora's Box in   our application:  The application is now showing a high load  36% of CPU and an increased use of memory up to 167 MB   [ 210 ]   The preceding image shows the impact of running the loop of requests in our system.  Let's explain it in the following:     The CPU in our application has gone to 11% with an average loop delay of   1.82 milliseconds. Regarding our system, the overall CPU utilization has  gone up to 36.11% due to the fact that both the application and bash script  use a significant amount of resources.     The memory consumption has soared from 81.9 MB to 167.6 MB. As you   can see, the line on the graph of memory allocation is not going straight up,  and that is due to garbage collections. A garbage collection is an activity  within the Node.js framework where unreferenced objects are freed from the  memory, allowing our system to reuse the hardware resources.     Regarding the errors, our application has been stable with 0 errors  we'll   come back to this section later .  Now, once our bash script is finished  I stopped it manually, as it can take a  significant amount of resources and time to finish , we can again see what happened  to our system in the following screenshot:  [ 211 ]   We can see that the CPU has gone back to normal, but what about the memory?  The memory consumed by our application hasn't been freed due to the fact that our  program has a memory leak, and as long as our variable is referencing the memory  consumed  remember the names array is accumulating more and more names , it  won't be freed.  In this case, we have a very simple example that clearly shows where the memory  leak is, but in complex applications, it is not always obvious. This error, in particular,  could never show up as a problem due to the fact that we probably deploy new  versions of our app often enough to not realize it.  Monitoring application exceptions Application errors are events that occur when our application can't handle an  unexpected situation. Things such as dividing a number by zero or trying to access  an undefined property of our application usually leads to these type of problems.  When working on a multithreaded framework  language  such as Tomcat, the fact  that one of our threads dies due to an exception usually only affects to one customer   the one holding the thread . However, in Node.js, a bubbled exception could be a  significant problem as our application dies.  PM2 and Seneca do a very good job at keeping it alive as PM2 will restart our app  if something makes it stop, and Seneca won't let the application die if an exception  occurs in one of the actions. Keymetrics has developed a module called pmx that we can use to programmatically  get alerts on errors:  var seneca = require 'seneca'   ;  var pmx = require 'pmx' ;  var names = [];  seneca.add {cmd: 'exception'}, function args, done {   pmx.notify new Error "Unexpected Exception!"  ;      done null ,{result: 100 args.number} ;  } ;  seneca.listen {port: 8085} ;  [ 212 ]   It is easy and self-descriptive: an action that sends an exception to Keymetrics if the  number sent as a parameter is zero. If we run it, we will get the following output:  Now we need to hit the server in order to cause the error. As we did earlier, we will  do this using curl:  curl -d '{"cmd": "exception", "number": "0"}' http:  localhost:8085 act  {"result":null}%  Now, when we go to Keymetrics, we can see that there is an error logged, as shown  in the following image:  Another interesting point of Keymetrics is the configuration of alerts. As PM2 sends  data about pretty much every metric in our system, we have the ability to configure  Keymetrics on the thresholds that we consider healthy for our application.  [ 213 ]   This is very handy as we could get the notifications integrated in our corporate chat   something similar to Slack  and be alerted real time when something is not going  correctly in our application.  Custom metrics Keymetrics also allows us to use probes. A probe is a custom metric that is sent  programmatically by the application to Keymetrics.  There are different types of values that the native library from Keymetrics allows us  to push directly. We are going to see the most useful ones. Simple metric A simple metric is, as its name indicates, a very basic metric where the developer can  set the value to the data sent to Keymetrics:  var seneca = require 'seneca'   ; var pmx = require "pmx" .init {   http: true,   errors: true,   custom_probes: true,   network: true,   ports: true } ; var names = []; var probe = pmx.probe  ;  var meter = probe.metric {   name      : 'Last call' } ;  seneca.add {cmd: 'last-call'}, function args, done {   console.log meter ;   meter.set new Date  .toISOString   ;   done null, {result: "done!"} ; } ;  seneca.listen {port: 8085} ;  [ 214 ]   In this case, the metric will send the time when the action was called for the last time  to the Keymetrics:  The configuration for this metric is non-existent:  var probe = pmx.probe  ;  var meter = probe.metric {   name      : 'Last call' } ;  There is no complexity in this metric. Counter This metric is very useful to count how many times an event occurred:  var seneca = require 'seneca'   ; var pmx = require "pmx" .init {   http: true,   errors: true,   custom_probes: true,   network: true,   ports: true } ; var names = []; var probe = pmx.probe  ;  var counter = probe.counter {   name : 'Number of calls' } ;  seneca.add {cmd: 'counter'}, function args, done {   counter.inc  ;   done null, {result: "done!"} ; } ;  seneca.listen {port: 8085} ;  [ 215 ]   In the preceding code, we can see how the counter is incremented for every single  call to the action counter.  This metric will also allow us to decrement the value calling the dec   method on  the counter:  counter.dec  ;  Average calculated values This metric allows us to record when an event occurs, and it will automatically  calculate the number of events per time unit. It is quite useful to calculate averages  and is a good tool to measure the load in the system. Let's see a simple example,   as follows:  var seneca = require 'seneca'   ; var pmx = require "pmx" .init {   http: true,   errors: true,   custom_probes: true,   network: true,   ports: true } ; var names = []; var probe = pmx.probe  ;  var meter = probe.meter {   name      : 'Calls per minute',   samples   : 60,   timeframe : 3600 } ;  seneca.add {cmd: 'calls-minute'}, function args, done {   meter.mark  ;   done null, {result: "done!"} ; } ;  seneca.listen {port: 8085} ;  The preceding code creates a probe and sends a new metric called Calls per  minute to Keymetrics.  [ 216 ]   Now, if we run the application and the following command a few times, the metric is  shown in the following Keymetrics interface:  curl -d '{"cmd": "calls-minute"}' http:  localhost:8085 act  As you can see, there is a new metric called Calls per minute in the UI. The key to  configure this metric is in the following initialization:  var meter = probe.meter {   name      : 'Calls per minute',   samples   : 60,   timeframe : 3600 } ;  As you can see, the name of the metric is in the configuration dictionary as well as in  two parameters: samples and timeframe.  The samples parameter correspond to the interval where we want to rate the metric;  in this case, it is the number of calls per minute so that rate is 60 seconds.  The timeframe parameter, on the other hand, is for how long we want Keymetrics to  hold the data for, or to express in simpler words, it is the timeframe over which the  metric will be analyzed.  [ 217 ]   Simian Army – the active monitoring from  Spotify Spotify is one of the companies of reference when building microservices-oriented  applications. They are extremely creative and talented when it boils down to coming  up with new ideas. One of my favourite ideas among them is what they call the Simian Army. I like to  call it active monitoring. In this book, I have talked a lot times about how humans fail at performing different  tasks. No matter how much effort you put in to creating your software, there are  going to be bugs that will compromise the stability of the system.  This is a big problem, but it becomes a huge deal when, with the modern cloud  providers, your infrastructure is automated with a script.  Think about it, what happens if in a pool of thousand servers, three of them have  the time zone out of sync with the rest of the servers? Well, depending on the nature  of your system, it could be fine or it could be a big deal. Can you imagine your bank  giving you a statement with disordered transactions?  Spotify has solved  or mitigated  the preceding problem by creating a number of  software agents  a program that moves within the different machines of our system ,  naming them after different species of monkeys with different purposes to ensure the  robustness of their infrastructure. Let's explain it a bit further.  As you are probably aware, if you have worked before with Amazon Web Services,  the machines and computational elements are divided in to regions  EU, Australia,  USA, and so on  and inside every region, there are availability zones, as shown in the  following diagram:  [ 218 ]   This enables us, the engineers, to create software and infrastructure without hitting  what we call a single point of failure.  A single point of failure is a condition in a system where the  failure of a single element will cause the system to misbehave.  [ 219 ]   This configuration raised a number of questions to the engineers in Spotify,   as follows:     What happens if we blindly trust our design without testing whether we   actually have any point of failures or not?     What happens if a full availability zone or region goes down?    How is our application going to behave if there is an abnormal latency for   some reason?  To answer all these questions, Netflix has created various agents. An agent is a  software that runs on a system  in this case, our microservices system  and carries on  different operations such as checking the hardware, measuring the network latency,  and so on. The idea of agent is not new, but until now, its application was nearly a  futuristic subject. Let's take a look at the following agents created by Netflix:     Chaos Monkey: This agent disconnects healthy machines from the network   in a given availability zone. This ensures that there are no single points of  failures within an availability zone. So that if our application is balanced across  four nodes, when the Chaos Monkey kicks in, it will disconnect one of these  four machines.     Chaos Gorilla: This is similar to Chaos Monkey, Chaos Gorilla will   disconnect a full availability zone in order to verify that Netflix services  rebalance to the other available zones. In other words, Chaos Gorilla is the  big brother of Chaos Monkey; instead of operating at the server level, it  operates at the partition level.     Latency Monkey: This agent is responsible for introducing artificial latencies   in the connections. Latency is usually something that is hardly considered  when developing a system, but it is a very delicate subject when building a  microservices architecture: latency in one node could compromise the quality  of the full system. When a service is running out of resources, usually the  first indication is the latency in the responses; therefore, Latency Monkey is a  good way to find out how our system will behave under pressure.     Doctor Monkey: A health check is an endpoint in our application that  returns an HTTP 200 if everything is correct and 500 error code if there  is a problem within the application. Doctor Monkey is an agent that will  randomly execute the health check of nodes in our application and report the  faulty ones in order to replace them.     10-18 Monkey: Organizations such as Netflix are global, so they need to be  language-aware  certainly, you don't want to get a website in German when  your mother tongue is Spanish . The 10-18 Monkey reports on instances that  are misconfigured.  [ 220 ]   There are a few other agents, but I just want to explain active monitoring to you.   Of course, this type of monitoring is out of reach of small organizations, but it  is good to know about their existence so that we can get inspired to set up our  monitoring procedures.  The code is available under Apache License in the following repository: https:  github.com Netflix SimianArmy.  In general, this active monitoring follows the philosophy of fail early, of which, I am  a big adept. No matter how big the flaw in your system is or how critical it is, you  want to find it sooner than later, and ideally, without impacting any customer.  Throughput and performance degradation Throughput is to our application what the monthly production is to a factory. It  is a unit of measurement that gives us an indication about how our application is  performing and answers the how many question of a system. Very close to throughput, there is another unit that we can measure: latency. Latency is the performance unit that answers the question of how long.  Let's consider the following example:  Our application is a microservices-based architecture that is responsible for  calculating credit ratings of applicants to withdraw a mortgage. As we have a large  volume of customers  a nice problem to have , we have decided to process the  applications in batches. Let's draw a small algorithm around it:  var seneca = require 'seneca'   ; var senecaPendingApplications = require 'seneca' .client {type:     'tcp',    port: 8002,    host: "192.168.1.2"} ;   var senecaCreditRatingCalculator =       require 'seneca' .client {type: 'tcp',    port: 8002,    host: "192.168.1.3"} ;  seneca.add {cmd: 'mortgages', action: 'calculate'}, function args,  callback  {   senecaPendingApplications.act {     cmd: 'applications',      section: 'mortgages',   [ 221 ]       custmers: args.customers}, function err, responseApplications  {       senecaCreditRatingCalculator.act {cmd: 'rating',           customers: args.customers}, function err, response  {          processApplications response.ratings,          responseApplications.applications,         args.customers        ;     } ;   } ; } ;  This is a small and simple Seneca application  this is only theoretical, don't try to run  it as there is a lot of code missing!  that acts as a client for two other microservices,   as follows:     The first one gets the list of pending applications for mortgages    The second one gets the list of credit rating for the customers that we have   requested  This could be a real situation for processing mortgage applications. In all fairness,  I worked on a very similar system in the past, and even though it was a lot more  complex, the workflow was very similar.  Let's talk about throughput and latency. Imagine that we have a fairly big batch of  mortgages to process and the system is misbehaving: the network is not being as fast  as it should and is experiencing some dropouts.  Some of these applications will be lost and will need to be retried. In ideal conditions,  our system is producing a throughput of 500 applications per hour and takes an  average of 7.2 seconds on latency to process every single application. However,  today, as we stated before, the system is not at its best; we are processing only 270  applications per hour and takes on average 13.3 seconds to process a single mortgage  application.  As you can see, with latency and throughput, we can measure how our business  transactions are behaving with respect to the previous experiences; we are operating  at 54% of our normal capacity.  This could be a serious issue. In all fairness, a drop off like this should ring all the  alarms in our systems as something really serious is going on in our infrastructure;  however, if we have been smart enough while building our system, the performance  will be degraded, but our system won't stop working. This can be easily achieved by  the usage of circuit breakers and queueing technologies such as RabbitMQ.  [ 222 ]   Queueing is one of the best examples to show how to apply human behavior to an  IT system. Seriously, the fact that we can easily decouple our software components  having a simple message as a joint point, which our services either produce or  consume, gives us a big advantage when writing complex software.  Other advantage of queuing over HTTP is that an HTTP message is lost if there is a  network drop out.  We need to build our application around the fact that it is either full success or  error. With queueing technologies such as RabbitMQ, our messaging delivery is  asynchronous so that we don't need to worry about intermittent failures: as soon as we  can deliver the message to the appropriate queue, it will get persisted until the client is able to  consume it  or the message timeout occurs . This enables us to account for intermittent errors in the infrastructure and build even  more robust applications based on the communication around queues.  Again, Seneca makes our life very easy: the plugin system on which the Seneca  framework is built makes writing a transport plugin a fairly simple task.  RabbitMQ transport plugin can be found in the following GitHub  repository: https:  github.com senecajs seneca-rabbitmq-transport There are quite few transport plugins and we can also create our own  ones  or modify the existing ones!  to satisfy our needs.  If you take a quick look at the RabbitMQ plugin  just as an example , the only   thing that we need to do to write a transport plugin is overriding the following   two Seneca actions:     seneca.add {role: 'transport', hook: 'listen', type:      seneca.add {role: 'transport', hook: 'client', type:   'rabbitmq'}, ...   'rabbitmq'}, ...   Using queueing technologies, our system will be more resilient against intermittent  failures and we would be able to degrade the performance instead of heading into a  catastrophic failure due to missing messages.  [ 223 ]   Summary In this chapter, we deep dived into PM2 monitoring through Keymetrics. We learned  how to put tight monitoring in place so that we are quickly informed about the  failures in our application. In the software development life cycle, the QA phase is, in my opinion, one of the  most important one: no matter how good your code looks, if it does not work, it is  useless. However, if I have to choose another phase where engineers should put  more emphasis, it would be the deployment, and more specifically, the monitoring  that is carried out after every deployment. If you receive error reports immediately,  chances are that the reaction can be quick enough to avoid bigger problems such as  corrupted data or customers complaining.  We also saw an example of active monitoring carried out by Netflix on their systems,  which even though might be out of the reach of your company, it can spark good  ideas and practices in order to monitor your software.  Keymetrics is just an example that fits the bill for Node.js as it is extremely well  integrated with PM2, but there are also other good monitoring systems such as  AppDynamics, or if you want to go for an in-house software, you could use Nagios.  The key is being clear about what you need to monitor in the application, and then,  find the best provider.  Another two good options for monitoring Node.js apps are StrongLoop and   New Relic. They are both on the same line with Keymetrics, but they work better   for large-scale systems, especially StrongLoop, which is oriented to applications  written in Node.js and oriented to microservices.  [ 224 ]   Deploying Microservices  In this chapter, we are going to deploy microservices. We will use different  technologies in order to provide the reader with the knowledge required to choose  the right tool for every job. First, we will use PM2 and its deployment capabilities  to run applications in remote servers. Then, we will play around Docker, which is  one of the most advanced deployment platforms, and the entire ecosystem around  containers. In this chapter, we will show how to automate all the deployments as  highly as possible.  Concepts in software deployment Deployments are usually the ugly friend of the Software Development Life Cycle   SDLC  party. There is a missing contact point between development and systems  administration that DevOps is going to solve in the next few years. The cost of fixing  bugs at different stages of SDLC is shown in the following figure:  This diagram shows the cost of fixing a bug, depending on the stage of the SDLC  [ 225 ]   Fail early is one of my favorite concepts in the lean methodology. In the change  management world, the cost of fixing a bug in the different stages of the software   life cycle is called the cost of change curve. Roughly, fixing a bug in production is estimated to cost 150 times the resources as  compared to the costs to fix it when taking requirements.  No matter what the figure is, which depends a lot on the methodology and  technology that we use, the lesson learned is that we can save a lot of time by  catching bugs early.  From the continuous integration up to continuous delivery, the process should be  automated as much as possible, where as much as possible means 100%. Remember,  humans are imperfect and more prone to errors while carrying out manual repetitive  tasks.  Continuous integration Continuous integration  CI  is the practice of integrating the work from different  branches on daily basis  or more than once a day  and validating that the changes   do not break existing features by running integration and unit tests.  CI should be automated using the same infrastructure configuration as we will   be using later in pre-production and production, so if there is any flaw, it can be  caught early.  Continuous delivery Continuous delivery  CD  is a software engineering approach that aims to build  small, testable, and easily deployable pieces of functionality that can be delivered  seamlessly at any time.  This is what we are aiming for with the microservices. Again, we should be pushing  to automate the delivery process as, if we are doing it manually, we are only looking  for problems.  When talking from the microservices' perspective, automation on deployments is  the key. We need to tackle the overhead of having a few dozen of services instead of  a few machines, or we can find ourselves maintaining a cloud of services instead of  adding value to our company. Docker is our best ally here. With Docker, we are reducing the hassle of deploying  a new software to pretty much moving a file  a container  around in different  environments, as we will see later in this chapter.  [ 226 ]   Deployments with PM2 PM2 is an extremely powerful tool. No matter what stage of development we are in,  PM2 always has something to offer.  In this phase of software development, the deployment is where PM2 really shines.  Through a JSON configuration file, PM2 will manage a cluster of applications so that  we can easily deploy, redeploy, and manage applications on remote servers.  PM2 – ecosystems PM2 calls a group of applications ecosystem. Every ecosystem is described by a  JSON file, and the easiest way to generate it is executing the following command:  pm2 ecosystem  This should output something similar to the following code:  [PM2] Spawning PM2 daemon  [PM2] PM2 Successfully daemonized  File  path to your app ecosystem.json generated  The content of the ecosystem.json file varies, depending on the version of PM2, but  what this file contains is the skeleton of a PM2 cluster:  {   apps : [      {       name      : "My Application",       script    : "app.js"     },      {       name      : "Test Web Server",       script    : "proxy-server.js"     }   ],  *    deploy : {     production : {       user : "admin",       host : "10.0.0.1",  [ 227 ]         ref  : "remotes origin master",       repo : "git@github.com:the-repository.git",       path : " apps repository",       "post-deploy" : "pm2 startOrRestart ecosystem.json --env           production"     },     dev : {       user : "devadmin",       host : "10.0.0.1",       ref  : "remotes origin master",       repo : "git@github.com:the-repository.git",       path : " home david development test-app ",       "post-deploy" : "pm2 startOrRestart ecosystem.json --env           dev",     }   } }  This file contains two applications configured for two environments. We are going to  modify this skeleton to adapt it to our needs, modeling our entire ecosystem written  in Chapter 4, Writing Your First Microservice in Node.js.  However, for now, let's explain a bit for the configuration:     We have an array of applications  apps  defining two apps: API and WEB    As you can see, we have a few configuration parameters for each app:  name: This is the name of the application script: This is the startup script of the app env: These are the environment variables to be injected into the  system by PM2 env_ : This is same as env, but it is tailored per  environment     There are two environments defined in the default ecosystem under the                        deploy key, as follows:  production dev  As you can see, between these two environments, there are no significant changes  except for the fact that we are configuring one environment variable in development  and the folder where we deploy our application.  [ 228 ]   Deploying microservices with PM2 In Chapter 4, Writing Your First Microservice in Node.js, we wrote a simple e-commerce  in order to show the different concepts and common catches in microservices.  Now, we are going to learn how to deploy them using PM2.  Configuring the server First thing we need to do in order to deploy software with PM2 is to configure the  remote machine and local machine to be able to talk using SSH, with a public private  key schema.  The way of doing it is easy, as follows:     Generate one RSA key     Install it into the remote server  Let's do it:  ssh-keygen -t rsa  That should produce something similar to the following output:  Generating public private rsa key pair.  Enter file in which to save the key   Users youruser .ssh id_rsa :   Users youruser .ssh pm2_rsa  Enter passphrase  empty for no passphrase :  Enter same passphrase again:  Your identification has been saved in pm2_rsa.  Your public key has been saved in pm2_rsa.pub.  The key fingerprint is:  eb:bc:24:fe:23:b2:6e:2d:58:e4:5f:ab:7b:b7:ee:38 dgonzalez@yourmachine. local  The key's randomart image is:  +--[ RSA 2048]----+                                                               .                 o    S              o   ..         [ 229 ]      o o..o.           . +.+=E..           oo++**B+.       +-----------------+  Now, if we go to the folder indicated in the preceding output, we can find the  following two files:     pm2_rsa: The first one, pm2_rsa, is your private key. As you can read from   the name, no one should have access to this key as they may steal your  identity in the servers that trust this key.     pm2_rsa.pub: The pm2_rsa.pub is your public key. This key can be handed  over to anyone so that using asymmetric cryptography techniques, they can  verify your identity  or who you say you are .  What we are going to do now is copy the public key to the remote server so that  when our local machine PM2 tries to talk to the server, it knows who we are and let's  get into the shell without password:  cat pm2_rsa.pub  ssh youruser@yourremoteserver 'cat >> .ssh authorized_ keys'  The last step is to register your private key as a known identity in your local machine:  ssh-add pm2_rsa  That's about it.  From now on, whenever you SSH into the remote server using as a user youruser,  you won't need to enter the password in order to get into the shell.  Once this configuration is done, there is very little to do in order to deploy any  application into this server:  pm2 deploy ecosystem.json production setup  pm2 deploy ecosystem.json production  The first command will configure everything needed to accommodate the app. The  second command will actually deploy the application itself as we configured earlier.  [ 230 ]   Docker – a container for software  delivery Virtualization has been one of the biggest trends in the past few years. Virtualization  enables the engineer to share the hardware across different software instances.  Docker is not really a virtualization software, but it is conceptually the same.  With a pure virtualization solution, a new OS runs on top of a hypervisor sitting on  top of an existing operating system  host OS . Running the full OS means that we can  be consuming a few gigabytes of hard drive in order to replicate the full stack from  the kernel to the filesystem, which usually consumes a good chunk of resources. The  structure of a virtualization solution is shown in the following image:  Layers diagram for a virtual machine environment  [ 231 ]   With Docker, we only replicate the filesystem and binaries so that there is no need  to run the full stack of the OS where we don't need it. Docker images are usually a  few hundreds of megabytes, instead of gigabytes, and they are quite lightweight,  therefore, we can run some containers on the same machine. The previous structure  using Docker is shown as follows:  Layers diagram for Docker  With Docker, we also eliminate one of the biggest problems of software deployment,  that is, the configuration management. We are switching a complicated per-environment configuration management, where  we need to worry about how the application is deployed configured into a container  that is basically like a software package that can be installed in any Docker-ready  machine.  The only Docker-ready OS nowadays is Linux, as Docker needs to make use of the  advanced kernel features, forcing Windows and Mac users to run a virtual machine  with Linux in order to provide support to run Docker containers.  [ 232 ]   Setting up the container Docker comes with a very powerful and familiar way  for developers  of configuring  the containers.  You can create containers based on an existing image  there are thousands of images  on the Internet  and then modify the image to fulfil your needs by adding new  software packages or altering the filesystem.  Once we are satisfied with it, we can use the new version of the image to create our  containers using a version control system similar to Git. However, we need to understand how Docker works first.  Installing Docker As it was mentioned before, Docker needs a virtual machine to provide support on  Mac and Windows, therefore, the installation on these systems may vary. The best  way to install Docker on your system is to go to the official website and follow   the steps:  https:  docs.docker.com engine installation   At the moment, it is a very active project, so you can expect changes every few weeks.  Choosing the image By default, Docker comes with no images. We can verify this by running docker  images on the terminal, which will produce an output very similar to the following  screenshot:  It is an empty list. There are no images stored in the local machine. The first thing  we need to do is search for an image. In this case, we are going to use CentOS as  our base for creating the images. CentOS is very close to Red Hat Enterprise Linux,  which seems to be one of the most extended distributions of Linux in the industry.  They provide great support and there is plenty of information available on the  Internet to troubleshoot problems.  [ 233 ]   Let's search for a CentOS image as follows:  As you can see, there is a long list of images based on CentOS, but only the first one  is official. This list of images is coming from something called the Registry in the Docker  world. A Docker Registry is a simple repository of images available to the general  public. You can also run your own Registry in order to prevent your images from  going to the general one.  More information can be found at the following link: https:  docs.docker.com registry   There is one column in the table in the preceding screenshot that should have  caught your attention almost immediately, the column called STARS. This column  represents the rating given by the users for a given image. We can narrow the search  based on the number of stars that the users have given to an image by using the   -s flag.  If you run the following command, you will see a list of images rated with 1000 or  more stars:  docker search -s 1000 centos  [ 234 ]   Be careful with the images you choose, there is nothing  preventing a user to create an image with malicious software.  In order to fetch the CentOS image to the local machine, we need to run the  following command:  docker pull centos  The output produced will be very similar to the following image:  Once the command finishes, if we run Docker images again, we can see that centos is  now appearing in the following list:  As we specified earlier, Docker does not use the full image, but it uses a reduced  version of it, only virtualizing the last few layers of the OS. You can clearly see it, as  the size of the image is not even 200 MB, which for a full version of CentOS, can go  up to a few GB.  Running the container Now that we have a copy of the image in our local machine, it is time to run it:  docker run -i -t centos  bin bash  [ 235 ]   This will produce the following output:  As you can see, the prompt of the terminal has changed to something like root@ debd09c7aa3b, which means that we are inside the container.  From now on, every single command that we run will be executed inside a contained  version of CentOS Linux.  There is another interesting command in Docker:  docker ps  If we run this command in a new terminal  without exiting from the running  container , we will get the following output:  This output is self explanatory; it is an easy way to see what is going on in our  Docker containers.  Installing the required software Let's install Node.js in the container:  curl --silent --location https:  rpm.nodesource.com setup_4.x  bash -  This command will pull and execute the setup script for Node.js.  [ 236 ]   This will produce an output very similar to the following image:  Follow the instructions, as this will install node:  yum install -y nodejs  It is highly recommended to install the development tools, as the installation process  of a few modules requires a compilation step. Let's do it:  yum install -y gcc-c++ make  Once the command finishes, we are ready to run the node applications inside   our container.  Saving the changes In the Docker world, an image is the configuration for a given container. We can use  the image as a template to run as many containers as we want, however first, we  need to save the changes made in the previous section.  If you are a software developer, you probably are familiar with control version  systems such as CVS, Subversion, or Git. Docker was built with their philosophy in  mind—a container can be treated like a versionable software component and then  changes can be committed.  [ 237 ]   In order to do it, run the following command:  docker ps -a  This command will show a list of containers that have run in the past, as shown in  the following image:  In my case, there are few containers, but the interesting one in this case is the second;  this is where Node.js is installed.  Now, we need to commit the status of the container in order to create a new image  with our changes. We do it by running the following command:  docker commit -a dgonzalez 62e7336a4627 centos-microservices:1.0  Let's explain the command:     The -a flag indicates the author. In this case, dgonzalez.    The following parameter is container id. As we indicated earlier, the   second container has the corresponding ID 62e7336a4627.     The third parameter is a combination of the name given to the new image  and the tag of the image. The tagging system can be very powerful when  we are dealing with quite a few images, as it can get really complicated to  identify small variations between them.  It might take a few seconds, but after finishing, the output of the command must be  very similar to the following image:  This is the indication that we have a new image in our list with our software  installed. Run docker images again and the output will confirm it, as shown   in the following image:  [ 238 ]   In order to run a container based on the new image, we can run the following  command:  docker run -i -t centos-microservices:1.0  bin bash  This will give us access to the shell in the container, and we can confirm that Node. js is installed by running node -v, which should output the version of Node, in this  case, 4.2.4.  Deploying Node.js applications Now, it is time to deploy Node.js applications inside the container. In order to   do it, we are going to need to expose the code from our local machine to the   Docker container.  The correct way of doing it is by mounting a local folder in the Docker machine,   but first, we need to create the small application to be run inside the container,   as follows:  var express = require 'express' ; var myApplication = express  ;  app.get ' hello', function  req, res  {   res.send 'Hello Earth!' ; } ;  var port = 80;  app.listen port, function    {   console.log 'Listeningistening on port '+ port ; } ;  It is a simple application, using Express that basically renders Hello Earth! into a  browser. If we run it from a terminal and we access http:  localhost:80 hello,  we can see the results.  Now, we are going to run it inside the container. In order to do it, we are going to  mount a local folder as a volume in the Docker container and run it.  Docker comes from the experience of sysadmins and developers that have lately  melted into a role called DevOps, which is somewhere in between them. Before  Docker, every single company had its own way of deploying apps and managing  configurations, so there was no consensus on how to do things the right way.  [ 239 ]   Now with Docker, the companies have a way to provide uniformity to deployments.  No matter what your business is, everything is reduced to build the container,  deploy the application, and run the container in the appropriate machine.  Let's assume that the application is in the  apps test  folder. Now, in order to  expose it to the container, we run the following command:  docker run -i -t -v  app test: test_app -p 8000:3000 centos- microservices:1.0  bin bash  As you can see, Docker can get very verbose with parameters, but let's explain them,  as follows:     The -i and -t flags are familiar to us. They capture the input and send the   output to a terminal.     The -v flag is new. It specifies a volume from the local machine and where to  mount it in the container. In this case, we are mounting  apps test from the  local machine into  test_app. Please note the colon symbol to separate the  local and the remote path.     The -p flag specifies the port on the local machine that will expose the   remote port in the container. In this case, we expose the port 3000 in the  container through the port 8000 in the Docker machine, so accessing docker- machine:8000 from the host machine will end up accessing the port 3000 in  the container.     The centos-microservices:1.0 is the name and tag of the image that we   have created in the preceding section.     The  bin bash is the command that we want to execute inside the container.   The  bin bash is going to give us access to the prompt of the system.  If everything worked well, we should have gotten access to the system prompt inside  the container, as shown in the following image:  As you can see in the image, there is a folder called  test_app that contains our  previous application, called small-script.js.  Now, it is time to access to the app, but first, let's explain how Docker works.  [ 240 ]   Docker is written in Go, which is a modern language created by Google, grouping all  the benefits from a compiled language such as C++ with all the high-level features  from a modern language such as Java.  It is fairly easy to learn and not hard to master. The philosophy of Go is to bring all  the benefits of an interpreted language, such as reducing the compilation times  the  complete language can be compiled in under a minute  to a compiled language.  Docker uses very specific features from the Linux kernel that forces Windows and  Mac users to use a virtual machine to run Docker containers. This machine used to be  called boot2docker, but the new version is called Docker Machine, which contains  more advanced features such as deploying containers in remote virtual machines.  For this example, we will only use the local capabilities.  Given that, if you run the app from within the container located in the  test_app   folder, and you are in Linux, accessing http:  localhost:8000 , it would be  enough to get into the application.  When you are using Mac or Windows, Docker is running either in the Docker  Machine or boot2docker so that the IP is given by this virtual machine, which is  shown when the Docker terminal starts, as shown in the following image:  As you can see, the IP is 192.168.99.100, so in order to access our application, we  need to visit the http:  192.168.99.100:9000  URL.  Automating Docker container creation If you remember, in the previous chapters, one of the most important concepts was  automation. Automation is the key when working with microservices. Instead of  operating one server, you probably will need to operate few dozens, reaching a point  where you are almost fully booked on day-to-day tasks.  [ 241 ]   Docker designers had that in mind when allowing the users to create containers from  a script written in a file called Dockerfile.  If you have ever worked on coding C or C++, even in college, you are probably  familiar with Makefiles. A Makefile file is a script where the developer specifies  the steps to automatically build a software component. Here is an example:  all: my-awesome-app  my-awesome-app: main.o external-module.o app-core.o   g++ main.o external-module.o app-core.o -o my-awesome-app  main.o: main.cc   g++ -c main.cc  external-module.o: external-module.cc   g++ -c external-module.cc  app-core.o: app-core.cc   g++ -c hello.cc  clean:   rm *.o my-awesome-app  The preceding Makefile contains a list of tasks and dependencies to be executed. For  example, if we execute make clean on the same folder where the Makefile file is  contained, it will remove the executable and all the files ending with o.  Dockerfile, unlike Makefile, is not a list of tasks and dependencies  even though  the concept is the same , it is a list of instructions to build a container from scratch to  a ready status.  Let's see an example:  FROM centos  MAINTAINER David Gonzalez  RUN yum -y install nodejs  RUN curl --silent --location https:  rpm.nodesource.com setup_4.x  bash  -  These small few preceding lines are enough to build a container having Node.js  installed.  [ 242 ]   Let's explain it in the following:     First, we choose the base image. In this case, it is centos as we used before.  For doing this, we use the FROM command and then the name of the image.    MAINTAINER specifies the name of the person who created the container. In   this case, it is David Gonzalez.     RUN, as its name indicates, runs a command. In this case, we use it twice: once   to add the repository to yum, and then to install Node.js.  Dockerfiles can contain a number of different commands. The documentation for  them is pretty clear, but let's take a look at the most common  aside from the ones  seen before :     CMD: This is similar to run, but it actually gets executed after building the  command. CMD is the command to be used to start an application once the  container is instantiated.     WORKDIR: This is to be used in conjunction with CMD, it is the command used   to specify the work directory for the next CMD command.     ADD: This command is used to copy files from the local filesystem to the  container instance filesystem. In the previous example, we can use ADD  to copy the application from the host machine into the container, run npm  install with the CMD command, and then run the app once again with  the CMD command. It can also be used to copy the content from a URL to a  destination folder inside the container.     ENV: This is used to set environment variables. For example, you could   specify a folder to store files uploaded by passing an environment variable to  the container, as follows: ENV UPLOAD_PATH= tmp      EXPOSE: This is used to expose ports to the rest of the containers in your cluster.  As you can see, the domain-specific language  DSL  of Dockerfiles is quite  rich and you can pretty much build every system required. There are hundreds  of examples on the Internet to build pretty much everything: MySQL, MongoDB,  Apache servers, and so on.  It is strongly recommended to create containers through Dockerfiles, as it can  be used as a script to replicate and make changes to the containers in the future,  as well as being able to automatically deploy our software without much manual  intervention.  [ 243 ]   Node.js event loop – easy to learn and  hard to master We all know that Node.js is a platform that runs applications in a single-threaded  way; so, why don't we use multiple threads to run applications so that we can get   the benefit of multicore processors? Node.js is built upon a library called libuv. This library abstracts the system calls,  providing an asynchronous interface to the program that uses it.  I come from a very heavy Java background, and there, everything is synchronous   unless you are coding with some sort of non-blocking libraries , and if you issue a  request to the database, the thread is blocked and resumed once the database replies  with the data.  This usually works fine, but it presents an interesting problem: a blocked thread is  consuming resources that could be used to serve other requests. The event loop of  Node.js is shown in the following figure:  This is the Node.js event loop diagram  JavaScript is, by default, an event-driven language. It executes the program that  configures a list of event handlers that will react to given events, and after that,   it just waits for the action to take place.  Let's take a look at a very familiar example:      Click here       Trigger the handler    [ 244 ]   Then the JavaScript code is as follows:  $  "target"  .click function   {   alert  "Handler for .click   called."  ; } ;  As you can see, this is a very simple example. HTML that shows a button and  snippet of JavaScript code that, using JQuery, shows an alert box when the   button is clicked. This is the key: when the button is clicked. Clicking a button is an event, and the event is processed through the event loop of  JavaScript using a handler specified in the JavaScript.  At the end of the day, we only have one thread executing the events, and we never  talk about parallelism in JavaScript, the correct word is concurrency. So, being more  concise, we can say that Node.js programs are highly concurrent.  Your application will always be executed in only one thread, and we need to keep  that in mind while coding.  If you have been working in Java or .NET or any other language frameworks  designed and implemented with thread-blocking techniques, you might have  observed that Tomcat, when running an application, spawns a number of threads  listening to the requests. In the Java world, each of these threads are called workers, and they are responsible  to handle the request from a given user from the beginning to the end. There is one  type of data structure in Java that takes the benefit of it. It is called ThreadLocal and  it stores the data in the local thread so that it can be recovered later on. This type of  storage is possible because the thread that starts the request is also responsible to  finish it, and if the thread is executing any blocking operation  such as reading a file  or accessing a database , it will wait until it is completed.  This is usually not a big deal, but when your software relies heavily on I O, the  problems can become serious.  Another big point in favor of the non-blocking model of Node.js is the lack of   context switch.  [ 245 ]   When the CPU switches one thread with another, what happens is that all the data in  the registers, and other areas of the memory, is stacked and allows the CPU to switch  the context with a new process that has its own data to be placed in there, as shown  in the following image:  This is a diagram showing context switching in threads from the theoretical point of view.  This operation takes time, and this time is not used by the application. It simply   gets lost. In Node.js, your application runs in only one thread, so there is no such  context switching while running  it is still present in the background, but hidden   to your program . In the following image, we can see what happens in the real world  when a CPU switches a thread:  This is a diagram showing context switching in threads from the    practical  shows the dead times  point of view.  Clustering Node.js applications By now, you know how Node.js applications work, and certainly, some of the  readers may have a question that if the app runs on a single thread, then what  happens with the modern multicore processors?  Before answering this question, let's take a look at the following scenario.  When I was in high school, there was a big technology leap in CPUs: the segmentation.  [ 246 ]   It was the first attempt to introduce parallelism at the instruction level. As you  probably are aware, the CPU interprets assembler instructions and each of these  instructions are composed of a number of phases, as shown in the following diagram:  Before the Intel 4x86, the CPUs were executing one instruction at the time, so taking  the instruction model from the preceding diagram, any CPU could only execute one  instruction every six CPU cycles.  Then, the segmentation came into play. With a set of intermediate registers, the CPU  engineers managed to parallelize the individual phases of instructions so that in the  best-case scenario, the CPUs are able to execute one instruction per cycle  or nearly ,  as shown in the following diagram:  The image describes the execution of instructions in a CPU with a segmented pipeline  [ 247 ]   This technical improvement led to faster CPUs and opened the door to native  hardware multithreading, which led to the modern n-core processors that can  execute a large number of parallel tasks, but when we are running Node.js  applications, we only use one core.  If we don't cluster our app, we are going to have a serious performance degradation  when compared to other platforms that take the benefit of the multiple cores of a CPU.  However, this time we are lucky, PM2 already allows you to cluster Node.js apps to  maximize the usage of your CPUs.  Also, one of the important aspects of PM2 is that it allows you to scale applications  without any downtime.  Let's run a simple app in the cluster mode:  var http = require "http" ; http.createServer function  request, response  {   response.writeHead 200, {     'Content-Type': 'text plain'   } ;   response.write 'Here we are!'    response.end  ; } .listen 3000 ;  This time we have used the native HTTP library for Node.js in order to handle the  incoming HTTP requests.  Now we can run the application from the terminal and see how it works:  node app.js  [ 248 ]   Although it does not output anything, we can curl to the http:  localhost:3000   URL in order to see how the server responds, as shown in the following screenshot:  As you can see, Node.js has managed all the HTTP negotiation and it has also  managed to reply with the Here we are! phrase as it was specified in the code.  This service is quite trivial, but it is the principle on which more complex web  services work, so we need to cluster the web service to avoid bottlenecks.  Node.js has one library called cluster that allows us to programmatically cluster  our application, as follows:  var cluster = require 'cluster' ; var http = require 'http' ; var cpus = require 'os' .cpus  .length;     Here we verify if the we are the master of the cluster: This is     the root process    and needs to fork al the childs that will be executing the web     server. if  cluster.isMaster  {   for  var i = 0; i < cpus; i++  {     cluster.fork  ;  [ 249 ]     }    cluster.on 'exit', function  worker, code, signal  {     console.log "Worker " + worker.proces.pid + " has finished." ;   } ; } else {      Here we are on the child process. They will be executing the       web server.   http.createServer function  request, response  {     response.writeHead 200 ;     response.end 'Here we are!d\n' ;   } .listen 80 ; }  Personally, I find it much easier to use specific software such as PM2 to accomplish  effective clustering, as the code can get really complicated while trying to handle the  clustered instances of our app.  Given this, we can run the application through PM2 as follows:  pm2 start app.js -i 1  The -i flag in PM2, as you can see in the output of the command, is used to specify  the number of cores that we want to use for our application.  If we run pstree, we can see the process tree in our system and check whether PM2  is running only one process for our app, as shown in the following image:  [ 250 ]   In this case, we are running the app in only one process, so it will be allocated in one  core of the CPU.  In this case, we are not taking advantage of the multicore capabilities of the CPU that  is running the app, but we still get the benefit of restarting the app automatically if  one exception bubbles up from our algorithm.  Now, we are going to run our application using all the cores available in our CPU so  that we maximize the usage of it, but first, we need to stop the cluster:  pm2 stop all  PM2, after stopping all the services     pm2 delete all  pm2 start app.js -i 0  Now, we are in a position to rerun the application using all the cores of our CPU:  PM2 showing four services running in a cluster mode  [ 251 ]   PM2 has managed to guess the number of CPUs in our computer, in my case, this is  an iMac with four cores, as shown in the following screenshot:  As you can see in pstree, PM2 started four threads at the OS level, as shown in the  following image:  [ 252 ]   When clustering an application, there is an unwritten rule about the number of   cores that an application should be using and this number is the number of cores  minus one.  The reason behind this number is the fact that the OS needs some CPU power so that  if we use all the CPUs in our application, once the OS starts carrying on with some  other tasks, it will force context switching as all the cores will be busy and this will  slow down the application.  Load balancing our application Sometimes, clustering our app is not enough and we need to scale our application  horizontally.  There are a number of ways to horizontally scale an app. Nowadays, with cloud  providers such as Amazon, every single provider has implemented their own  solution with a number of features. One of my preferred ways of implementing the load balancing is using NGINX. NGINX is a web server with a strong focus on the concurrency and low memory  usage. It is also the perfect fit for Node.js applications as it is highly discouraged to  serve static resources from within a Node.js application. The main reason is to avoid  the application from being under stress due to a task that could be done better with  another software, such as NGINX  which is another example of specialization .  [ 253 ]   However, let's focus on load balancing. The following figure shows how NGINX  works as a load balancer:  As you can see in the preceding diagram, we have two PM2 clusters load balanced  by an instance of NGINX.  The first thing we need to do is know how NGINX manages the configuration.  On Linux, NGINX can be installed via yum, apt-get, or any other package manager.  It can also be built from the source, but the recommended method, unless you have  very specific requirements, is to use a package manager.  [ 254 ]   By default, the main configuration file is  etc nginx nginx.conf, as follows:  user  nginx; worker_processes  1;  error_log   var log nginx error.log warn; pid         var run nginx.pid;  events {   worker_connections  1024; }  http {   include                      etc nginx mime.types;   default_type                application octet-stream;    log_format          main '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local]        "$request" '      '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '      '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for" '      '$request_time';    access_log                   var log nginx access.log  main;   server_tokens               off;   sendfile                    on;   tcp_nopush                 on;   keepalive_timeout           65s;   send_timeout                15s;   client_header_timeout       15s;   client_body_timeout         15s;   client_max_body_size        5m;   ignore_invalid_headers      on;   fastcgi_buffers             16 4k;   gzip                       on;   include                      etc nginx sites-enabled *.conf; }  This file is pretty straightforward, it specifies the number of workers  remember,  processes to serve requests , the location of error logs, number connections that a  worker can have active at the time, and finally, the HTTP configuration.  The last line is the most interesting one: we are informing NGINX to use    etc nginx sites-enabled *.conf as potential configuration files.  [ 255 ]   With this configuration, every file ending in .conf under the specified folder is going  to be part of the NGINX configuration.  As you can see, there is a default file already existing there. Modify it to look   as follows:  http {   upstream app {     server 10.0.0.1:3000;     server 10.0.0.2:3000;   }   server {     listen 80;     location   {       proxy_pass http:  app;     }   } }  This is all the configuration we need to build a load balancer. Let's explain it   in the following:     The upstream app directive is creating a group of services called app. Inside   this directive, we specify two servers as we've seen in the previous image.     The server directive specifies to NGINX that it should be listening to all the  requests from port 80 and passing them to the group of upstream called app.  Now, how does NGINX decide to send the request to which computer?  In this case, we could specify the strategy used to spread the load.  By default, NGINX, when there is not a balancing method specifically configured,  uses Round Robin. One thing to bear in mind is that if we use round robin, our application should be  stateless as we won't be always hitting the same machine, so if we save the status in  the server, it might not be there in the following call.  Round Robin is the most elementary way of distributing load from a queue of   work into a number of workers; it rotates them so that every node gets the same  amount of requests.  [ 256 ]   There are other mechanisms to spread the load, as follows:    upstream app {     least_conn;     server 10.0.0.1:3000;     server 10.0.0.2:3000;   }    upstream app {     ip_hash;     server 10.0.0.1:3000;     server 10.0.0.2:3000;   }  Least connected, as its name indicates, sends the request to the least connected node,  equally distributing the load between all the nodes:  IP hashing is an interesting way of distributing the load. If you have ever worked  with any web application, the concept of sessions is something present in almost  any application. In order to remember who the user is, the browser sends a cookie  to the server, which has stored who the user is in memory and what data he she  needs can be accessed by that given user. The problem with the other type of load  balancing is that we are not guaranteed to always hit the same server.  For example, if we are using Least connected as a policy for balancing, we could  hit the server one in the first load, but then hit a different server on subsequent  redirections that will result in the user not being displayed with the right information  as the second server won't know who the user is.  With IP hashing, the load balancer will calculate a hash for a given IP. This hash will  somehow result in a number from 1 to N, where N is the number of servers, and  then, the user will always be redirected to the same machine as long as they keep the  same IP.  We can also apply a weight to the load balancing, as follows:    upstream app {     server 10.0.0.1:3000 weight=5;     server 10.0.0.2:3000;   }  This will distribute the load in such way that, for every six requests, five will be  directed to the first machine and one will be directed to the second machine.  [ 257 ]   Once we have chosen our preferred load balancing method, we can restart NGINX  for the changes to take effect, but first, we want to validate them as shown in the  following image:  As you can see, the configuration test can be really helpful in order to avoid  configuration disasters.  Once NGINX has passed configtest, it is guaranteed that NGINX will be able to  restart start reload without any syntax problem, as follows:  sudo  etc init.d nginx reload  Reload will gracefully wait until the old threads are done, and then, reload the  configuration and route the new requests with the new configuration.  If you are interested in learning about NGINX, I found the following official  documentation of NGINX quite helpful:  http:  nginx.org en docs   Health check on NGINX Health checking is one of the important activities on a load balancer. What happens  if one of the nodes suffers a critical hardware failure and is unable to serve more  requests? In this case, NGINX comes with two types of health checks: passive and active.  Passive health check Here, NGINX is configured as a reverse proxy  as we did in the preceding section .   It reacts to a certain type of response from the upstream servers.  If there is an error coming back, NGINX will mark the node as faulty, removing it  from the load balancing for a certain period of time before reintroducing it. With  this strategy, the number of failures will be drastically reduced as NGINX will be  constantly removing the node from the load balancer.  [ 258 ]   There are a few configurable parameters, such as max_fails or fail_timeout,  where we can configure the amount of failures required to mark a node as invalid   or the time out for requests.  Active health check Active health checks, unlike passive health checks, actively issue connections   to the upstream servers to check whether they are responding correctly to the  experiencing problems.  The most simplistic configuration for active health checks in NGINX is the   following one:  http {   upstream app {     zone app test;     server 10.0.0.1:3000;     server 10.0.0.2:3000;   }   server {     listen 80;     location   {       proxy_pass http:  app;       health_check;     }   } }  There are two new lines in this config file, as follows:     health_check: This enables the active health check. The default configuration  is to issue a connection every five seconds to the host and port specified in the  upstream section.     zone app test: This is required by the NGINX configuration when enabling   the health check.  There is a wide range of options to configure more specific health checks, and all of  them are available in NGINX configuration that can be combined to satisfy the needs  of different users.  [ 259 ]   Summary In this chapter, you learned a wide range of technologies that we can use to deploy  microservices. By now you know how to build, deploy, and configure software  components in such a way that we are able to homogenize a very diverse range of  technologies. The objective of this book is to provide you the concepts required to  start working with microservices and enable the reader to know how to look for the  needed information.  Personally, I have struggled to find a book that provides a summary of all the   aspects of the life cycle of microservices and I really hope that this book covers   this empty space.
