But now, after twelve years, it’s time for a new edition that covers C++11, the new C++ standard.  Note that this means more than simply adding new libraries. C++ has changed. Almost all typical applications of parts of the library look a bit different now. This is not the result of a huge language change. It’s the result of many minor changes, such as using rvalue references and move semantics, range-based for loops, auto, and new template features. Thus, besides presenting new libraries and supplementary features of existing libraries, almost all of the examples in this book were rewritten at least partially. Nevertheless, to support programmers who still use “old” C++ environments, this book will describe differences between C++ versions whenever they appear.  I learned C++11 the hard way. Because I didn’t follow the standardization as it was happening I started to look at C++11 about two years ago. I really had trouble understanding it. But the people on the standardization committee helped me to describe and present the new features as they are intended to be used now.  Note, ﬁnally, that this book now has a problem: Although the book’s size grew from about 800 to more than 1,100 pages, I still can’t present the C++ standard library as a whole. The library part of the new C++11 standard alone now has about 750 pages, written in very condensed form without much explanation. For this reason, I had to decide which features to describe and in how much detail. Again, many people in the C++ community helped me to make this decision. The intent was to concentrate on what the average application programmer needs. For some missing parts, I provide a supplementary chapter on the Web site of this book, http:  www.cppstdlib.com, but you still will ﬁnd details not mentioned here in the standard.  The art of teaching is not the art of presenting everything. It’s the art of separating the wheat  from the chaff so that you get the most out of it. May the exercise succeed.   Acknowledgments for the Second Edition  This book presents ideas, concepts, solutions, and examples from many sources. Over the past several years, the C++ community introduced many ideas, concepts, proposals, and enhancements to C++ that became part of C++11. Thus, again I’d like to thank all the people who helped and supported me while preparing this new edition.  First, I’d like to thank everyone in the C++ community and on the C++ standardization commit- tee. Besides all the work to add new language and library features, they had a hard time explaining everything to me, but they did so with patience and enthusiasm.  Scott Meyers and Anthony Williams allowed me to use their teaching material and book manu-  scripts so that I could ﬁnd many useful examples not yet publicly available.  I’d also like to thank everyone who reviewed this book and gave valuable feedback and clar- iﬁcations: Dave Abrahams, Alberto Ganesh Barbati, Pete Becker, Thomas Becker, Hans Boehm, Walter E. Brown, Paolo Carlini, Lawrence Crowl, Beman Dawes, Doug Gregor, David Grigsby, Pablo Halpern, Howard Hinnant, John Lakos, Bronek Kozicki, Dietmar Kuhl, Daniel Krugler, Mat Marcus, Jens Maurer, Alisdair Meredith, Bartosz Milewski, P. J. Plauger, Tobias Schule, Peter Sommerlad, Jonathan Wakely, and Anthony Williams.  ¨ ¨  ¨  There is one person who did an especially outstanding job. Whenever I had a question, Daniel ¨ Krugler answered almost immediately with incredible accurateness and knowledge. Everyone in the standardization process know that he treats everybody this way. Without him, both the C++ standard and this book would not have the quality they have now.  Many thanks to my editor Peter Gordon, Kim Boedigheimer, John Fuller, and Anna Popick from Addison-Wesley. Besides their support, they found the right balance between patience and pressure. The copy editor Evelyn Pyle and the proofreader Diane Freed did an incredible job translating my German English into American English. In addition, thanks to Frank Mittelbach for solving my LATEX issues.  Last but not least, all my thanks go to Jutta Eckstein. Jutta has the wonderful ability to force and support people in their ideals, ideas, and goals. While most people experience this only when working with her, I have the honor to beneﬁt in my day-to-day life.   Preface to the First Edition  In the beginning, I only planned to write a small German book  400 pages or so  about the C++ stan- dard library. That was in 1993. Now, in 1999 you see the result — a book in English with more than 800 pages of facts, ﬁgures, and examples. My goal is to describe the C++ standard library so that all  or almost all  your programming questions are answered before you think of the question. Note, however, that this is not a complete description of all aspects of the C++ standard library. Instead, I present the most important topics necessary for learning and programming in C++ by using its standard library.  Each topic is described based on the general concepts; this discussion then leads to the speciﬁc details needed to support everyday programming tasks. Speciﬁc code examples are provided to help you understand the concepts and the details.  That’s it — in a nutshell. I hope you get as much pleasure from reading this book as I did from  writing it. Enjoy!   Acknowledgments for the First Edition  This book presents ideas, concepts, solutions, and examples from many sources. In a way it does not seem fair that my name is the only name on the cover. Thus, I’d like to thank all the people and companies who helped and supported me during the past few years.  First, I’d like to thank Dietmar Kuhl. Dietmar is an expert on C++, especially on input output streams and internationalization  he implemented an I O stream library just for fun . He not only translated major parts of this book from German to English, he also wrote sections of this book using his expertise. In addition, he provided me with invaluable feedback over the years.  ¨  Second, I’d like to thank all the reviewers and everyone else who gave me their opinion. These people endow the book with a quality it would never have had without their input.  Because the list is extensive, please forgive me for any oversight.  The reviewers for the English version of this book included Chuck Allison, Greg Comeau, James A. Crotinger, Gabriel Dos Reis, Alan Ezust, Nathan Myers, Werner Mossner, Todd Veldhuizen, Chichiang Wan, Judy Ward, and Thomas Wike- hult. The German reviewers included Ralf Boecker, Dirk Herrmann, Dietmar Kuhl, Edda Lorke, Herbert Scheubner, Dominik Strasser, and Martin Weitzel. Additional input was provided by Matt Austern, Valentin Bonnard, Greg Colvin, Beman Dawes, Bill Gibbons, Lois Goldthwaite, Andrew Koenig, Steve Rumsby, Bjarne Stroustrup, and David Vandevoorde.  ¨  ¨  Special thanks to Dave Abrahams, Janet Cocker, Catherine Ohala, and Maureen Willard who reviewed and edited the whole book very carefully. Their feedback was an incredible contribution to the quality of this book.  A special thanks goes to my “personal living dictionary” — Herb Sutter — the author of the famous “Guru of the Week”  a regular series of C++ programming problems that is published on the comp.lang.c++.moderated Internet newsgroup .  I’d also like to thank all the people and companies who gave me the opportunity to test my examples on different platforms with different compilers. Many thanks to Steve Adamczyk, Mike Anderson, and John Spicer from EDG for their great compiler and their support. It was a big help during the standardization process and the writing of this book. Many thanks to P. J. Plauger and Dinkumware, Ltd, for their early standard-conforming implementation of the C++ standard library. Many thanks to Andreas Hommel and Metrowerks for an evaluative version of their CodeWarrior Programming Environment. Many thanks to all the developers of the free GNU and egcs compilers. Many thanks to Microsoft for an evaluative version of Visual C++. Many thanks to Roland Hartinger   Acknowledgments for the First Edition  xxvii  from Siemens Nixdorf Informations Systems AG for a test version of their C++ compiler. Many thanks to Topjects GmbH for an evaluative version of the ObjectSpace library implementation.  Many thanks to everyone from Addison Wesley Longman who worked with me. Among oth- ers this includes Janet Cocker, Mike Hendrickson, Debbie Lafferty, Marina Lang, Chanda Leary, Catherine Ohala, Marty Rabinowitz, Susanne Spitzer, and Maureen Willard. It was fun.  In addition, I’d like to thank the people at BREDEX GmbH and all the people in the C++ com- munity, particularly those involved with the standardization process, for their support and patience  sometimes I ask really silly questions .  Last but not least, many thanks and kisses for my family: Ulli, Lucas, Anica, and Frederic. I  deﬁnitely did not have enough time for them due to the writing of this book.  Have fun and be human!   This page intentionally left blank    Chapter 1 About This Book  1.1 Why This Book  Soon after its introduction, C++ became a de facto standard in object-oriented programming. This led to the goal of standardization. Only by having a standard could programs be written that would run on different platforms — from PCs to mainframes. Furthermore, a standard library would enable programmers to use general components and a higher level of abstraction without losing portability rather than having to develop all code from scratch.  Now, with the second standard, called C++11  see Section 2.1, page 7, for the detailed history of C++ standards , we have a huge C++ standard library whose speciﬁcation requires more than double the size of the core language features. The library enables the use of   Input output  I O  classes   String types and regular expressions   Various data structures, such as dynamic arrays, linked lists, binary trees, and hash tables   Various algorithms, such as a variety of sorting algorithms   Classes for multithreading and concurrency   Classes for internationalization support   Numeric classes   Plenty of utilities However, the library is not self-explanatory. To use these components and to beneﬁt from their power, you need an introduction that explains the concepts and the important details instead of simply listing the classes and their functions. This book is written exactly for that purpose. First, it introduces the library and all its components from a conceptual point of view. Next, the book describes the details needed for practical programming. Examples are included to demonstrate the exact use of the components. Thus, this book is a detailed introduction to the C++ library for both the beginner and the practicing programmer. Armed with the data provided herein, you should be able to take full advantage of the C++ standard library.   2  Chapter 1: About This Book  Caveat: I don’t promise that everything described is easy and self-explanatory. The library provides a lot of ﬂexibility, but ﬂexibility for nontrivial purposes has a price. The library has traps and pitfalls, which I point out when we encounter them and suggest ways of avoiding them.  1.2 Before Reading This Book  To get the most from this book, you should already know C++.  The book describes the standard components of C++ but not the language itself.  You should be familiar with the concepts of classes, inheritance, templates, exception handling, and namespaces. However, you don’t have to know all the minor details about the language. The important details are described in the book; the minor details about the language are more important for people who want to implement the library rather than to use it.  Note that the language has changed during the standardization of C++11, just as it changed during the standardization of C++98, so your knowledge might not be up-to-date. Chapter 3 provides a brief overview of and introduction to the latest language features that are important for using the C++11 library. Many of the new library features use these new language features, so you should read Chapter 3 to review all the new features of C++. But I will also refer to that chapter when libraries use new language features.  1.3 Style and Structure of the Book  The C++ standard library provides components that are somewhat, but not totally, independent of one another, so there is no easy way to describe each part without mentioning others. I considered various approaches for presenting the contents of this book. One was on the order of the C++ stan- dard. However, this is not the best way to explain the components of the C++ standard library from scratch. Another approach was to start with an overview of all components, followed by chapters that provided more details. Alternatively, I could have sorted the components, trying to ﬁnd an order that had a minimum of cross-references to other sections. My solution was to use a mixture of all three approaches. I start with a brief introduction of the general concepts and the utilities that the library uses. Then, I describe all the components, each in one or more chapters. The ﬁrst compo- nent is the standard template library  STL . There is no doubt that the STL is the most powerful, most complex, and most exciting part of the library. Its design inﬂuences other components heav- ily. Then, I describe the more self-explanatory components, such as special containers, strings, and regular expressions. The next component discussed is one you probably know and use already: the IOStream library. That component is followed by a discussion of internationalization, which had some inﬂuence on the IOStream library. Finally, I describe the library parts dealing with numerics, concurrency, and allocators.  Each component description begins with the component’s purpose, design, and some examples. Next, a detailed description begins with various ways to use the component, as well as any traps and pitfalls associated with it. The description usually ends with a reference section, in which you can ﬁnd the exact signature and deﬁnition of a component’s classes and its functions.   1.3 Style and Structure of the Book  3  List of Contents  should know to read this book and to use the C++ standard library.  The ﬁrst ﬁve chapters introduce this book and the C++ standard library in general:   Chapter 1: About This Book introduces the book’s subject and describes its contents.   Chapter 2: Introduction to C++ and the Standard Library provides a brief overview of the history of the C++ standard library and the context of its standardization and introduces the concept of complexity.   Chapter 3: New Language Features provides an overview of the new language features you   Chapter 4: General Concepts describes the fundamental library concepts that you need to understand to work with all the components. In particular, the chapter introduces the namespace std, the format of header ﬁles, and the general support of error and exception handling.   Chapter 5: Utilities describes several small utilities provided for the user of the library and for the library itself. In particular, the chapter describes classes pair  and tuple , smart pointers, numeric limits, type traits and type utilities, auxiliary functions, class ratio , clocks and timers, and available C functions.  Chapters 6 through 11 describe all aspects of the STL:   Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library presents a detailed introduction to the concept of the STL, which provides container classes and algorithms that are used to process collections of data. The chapter explains step-by-step the concept, the problems, and the special programming techniques of the STL, as well as the roles of its parts.   Chapter 7: STL Containers explains the concepts and describes the abilities of the STL’s con- tainer classes. The chapter describes arrays, vectors, deques, lists, forward lists, sets, maps, and unordered containers with their common abilities, differences, speciﬁc beneﬁts, and drawbacks and provides typical examples.   Chapter 8: STL Container Members in Detail lists and describes all container members  types   Chapter 9: STL Iterators explains the various iterator categories, the auxiliary functions for iterators, and the iterator adapters, such as stream iterators, reverse iterators, insert iterators, and move iterators.   Chapter 10: STL Function Objects and Using Lambdas details the STL’s function object classes, including lambdas, and how to use them to deﬁne the behavior of containers and algo- rithms.   Chapter 11: STL Algorithms lists and describes the STL’s algorithms. After a brief introduc- tion and comparison of the algorithms, each algorithm is described in detail, followed by one or more example programs.  and operations  in the form of a handy reference.  as the class bitset, which manages a bitﬁeld with an arbitrary number of bits or ﬂags.  Chapters 12 through 14 describe “simple” individual standard classes of the C++ standard library:   Chapter 12: Special Containers describes the container adapters for queues and stacks, as well   Chapter 13: Strings describes the string types of the C++ standard library  yes, there are more than one . The standard provides strings as “kind of” fundamental data types with the ability to use different types of characters.   4  Chapter 1: About This Book    Chapter 14: Regular Expressions describes the interface to deal with regular expressions,  which can be used to search and replace characters and substrings.  Chapters 15 and 16 deal with the two closely related subjects of I O and internationalization:   Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes covers the standardized form of the com- monly known IOStream library. The chapter also describes details that are typically not so well known but that may be important to programmers, such as the correct way to deﬁne and integrate special I O channels.   Chapter 16: Internationalization covers the concepts and classes for the internationalization of programs, such as the handling of different character sets and the use of different formats for ﬂoating-point numbers and dates.  The remaining chapters cover numerics, concurrency, and allocators:   Chapter 17: Numerics describes the numeric components of the C++ standard library: in par- ticular, classes for random numbers and distributions, types for complex numbers, and some numeric C functions.   Chapter 18: Concurrency describes the features provided by the C++ standard library to enable   Chapter 19: Allocators describes the concept of different memory models in the C++ standard  and support concurrency and multithreading.  library.  The book concludes with a bibliography and an index.  Due to the size of this book I had to move material that is not so relevant for the average appli- cation programmer but should be covered to a supplementary chapter provided on the Web site of this book: http:: www.cppstdlib.com. That material includes:   Details of bitsets  introduced in Section 12.5    Class valarray   very brieﬂy introduced in Section 17.4    Details of allocators  introduced in Chapter 19   1.4 How to Read This Book  This book is both an introductory user’s guide and a structured reference manual about the C++ standard library. The individual components of the C++ standard library are somewhat independent of one another, so after reading Chapters 2 through 5 you could read the chapters that discuss the individual components in any order. Bear in mind that Chapters 6 through 11 all describe the same component. To understand the other STL chapters, you should start with the introduction to the STL in Chapter 6.  If you are a C++ programmer who wants to know, in general, the concepts and all parts of the library, you could simply read the book from beginning to end. However, you should skip the reference sections. To program with certain components of the C++ standard library, the best way to ﬁnd something is to use the index, which I have tried to make comprehensive enough to save you time when you are looking for something.  In my experience, the best way to learn something new is to look at examples. Therefore, you’ll ﬁnd a lot of examples throughout the book. They may be a few lines of code or complete programs.   1.5 State of the Art  5  In the latter case, you’ll ﬁnd the name of the ﬁle containing the program as the ﬁrst comment line. You can ﬁnd the ﬁles on the Internet at the Web site of the book: http:  www.cppstdlib.com.  1.5 State of the Art  The C++11 standard was completed while I was writing this book. Please bear in mind that some compilers might not yet conform to the standard. This will most likely change in the near future. As a consequence, you might discover that not all things covered in this book work as described on your system, and you may have to change example programs to ﬁt your speciﬁc environment.  1.6 Example Code and Additional Information  You can access all example programs and acquire more information about this book and the C++ standard library from my Web site: http:  www.cppstdlib.com. Also, you can ﬁnd a lot of additional information about this topic on the Internet. See the bibliography, which is also provided on the Web site, for some of them.  1.7 Feedback  I welcome your feedback  good and bad  on this book. I tried to prepare it carefully; however, I’m human, and at some point I have to stop writing and tweaking. So, you may ﬁnd some errors, inconsistencies, or subjects that could be described better. Your feedback will give me the chance to improve later editions.  The best way to reach me is by email. However, to avoid spam problems, I haven’t included an email address inside this book.  I had to stop using the email address I put in the ﬁrst edi- tion after I started getting thousands of spam emails per day.  Please refer to the book’s Web site, http:  www.cppstdlib.com, to get an email address for feedback.  Many thanks.   This page intentionally left blank    Chapter 2 Introduction to C++ and the Standard Library  In this chapter, I discuss the history and different versions of C++ and introduce the Big-O notation, which is used to specify the performance and scalability of library operations.  2.1 History of the C++ Standards  The standardization of C++ was started in 1989 by the International Organization for Standardization  ISO , which is a group of national standards organizations, such as ANSI in the United States. To date, this work has resulted in four milestones, which are more or less C++ standards available on different platforms throughout the world: 1. C++98, approved in 1998, was the ﬁrst C++ standard. Its ofﬁcial title is Information Technology  — Programming Languages — C++, and its document number is ISO IEC 14882:1998.  2. C++03, a so-called “technical corrigendum”  “TC” , contains minor bug ﬁxes to C++98. Its document number is ISO IEC 14882:2003. Thus, both C++98 and C++03 refer to the “ﬁrst C++ standard.”  3. TR1 contains library extensions for the ﬁrst standard. Its ofﬁcial title is Information Technology — Programming Languages — Technical Report on C++ Library Extensions, and its document number is ISO IEC TR 19768:2007. The extensions speciﬁed here were all part of a namespace std::tr1.  4. C++11, approved in 2011, is the second C++ standard. C++11 has signiﬁcant improvements in both the language and the library, for which the extensions of TR1 have become part of name- space std . The ofﬁcial title is again Information Technology — Programming Languages — C++, but a new document number is used: ISO IEC 14882:2011.   8  Chapter 2: Introduction to C++ and the Standard Library  This books covers C++11, which long had the working title “C++0x,” with the expectation that it would be done no later than 2009.1 So, both C++11 and C++0x mean the same thing. Throughout the book, I use the term C++11.  Because some platforms and environments still do not support all of C++11  both language  features and libraries , I mention whether a feature or behavior is available only since C++11.  2.1.1 Common Questions about the C++11 Standard  Where Is the Standard Available?  The latest freely available draft of the C++11 standard is available as document N3242  see [C++Std2011Draft] . While that draft should be adequate for most users and programmers, those who need the real standard have to pay ISO or a national body a price for it.  Why Did the Standardization Take So Long?  You may wonder why the standardization process for both standards took 10 years or more and why it is still not perfect. Note, however, that the standard is the result of many people and companies suggesting improvements and extensions, discussing them with others, waiting for implementations to test them, and solving all problems caused by the intersection of all the features. Nobody was working as a full-time employee for the new C++ standard. The standard is not the result of a company with a big budget and a lot of time. Standards organizations pay nothing or almost nothing to the people who work on developing standards. So, if a participant doesn’t work for a company that has a special interest in the standard, the work is done for fun. Thank goodness a lot of dedicated people had the time and the money to do just that. Between 50 and 100 people regularly met about three times a year for a week to discuss all topics and ﬁnish the task and used email throughout the rest of the year. As a result, you won’t get anything perfect or consistently designed. The result is usable in practice but is not perfect  nothing ever is .  The description of the standard library took up about 50% of the ﬁrst standard, and that increased to 65% in the second standard.  With C++11, the number of pages covering the library rose from about 350 to about 750 pages.   Note that the standard has various sources. In fact, any company or country or even individuals could propose new features and extensions, which then had to get accepted by the whole standard- ization organization. In principle, nothing was designed from scratch.2 Thus, the result is not very homogeneous. You will ﬁnd different design principles for different components. A good example is the difference between the string class and the STL, which is a framework for data structures and algorithms:   String classes are designed as a safe and convenient component. Thus, they provide an almost  self-explanatory interface and check for many errors in the interface.  1 The usual joke here is that x ﬁnally became a hexadecimal b. 2 You may wonder why the standardization process did not design a new library from scratch. The major purpose of standardization is not to invent or to develop something; it is to harmonize an existing practice.   2.1 History of the C++ Standards  9    The STL was designed to combine different data structures with different algorithms while achieving the best performance. Thus, the STL is not very convenient and is not required to check for many logical errors. To beneﬁt from the powerful framework and great performance of the STL, you must know the concepts and apply them carefully.  Both of these components are part of the same library. They were harmonized a bit, but they still follow their individual, fundamental design philosophies.  Nevertheless, another goal of C++11 was to simplify things. For this reason, a lot of proposals were introduced in C++11 to solve problems, inconsistencies, and other ﬂaws people found in prac- tice. For example, the way to initialize values and objects was harmonized with C++11. Also, the more or less broken smart pointer class auto_ptr was replaced by multiple improved smart pointer classes, previously matured in Boost, a Web site dedicated to free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries  see [Boost]  to gain practical experience before being included in a new standard or another technical corrigendum.  Is This the Last C++ Standard?  C++11 is not the end of the road. People already have bug ﬁxes, additional requirements, and proposals for new features. Thus, there will probably be another “technical corrigendum” with ﬁxes of bugs and inconsistencies, and sooner or later, there might be a “TR2” and or a third standard.  2.1.2 Compatibility between C++98 and C++11  A design goal of C++11 was that it remain backward compatible with C++98. In principle, every- thing that compiled with C++98 or C++03 should compile with C++11. However, there are some exceptions. For example, variables cannot have the name of newly introduced keywords anymore.  If code should work with different C++ versions but beneﬁt from the improvements of C++11, if available, you can evaluate the predeﬁned macro __cplusplus. For C++11, the following deﬁnition holds when compiling a C++ translation unit:  define __cplusplus 201103L  By contrast, with both C++98 and C++03, it was:  define __cplusplus 199711L  Note, however, that compiler vendors sometimes provide different values here.  Note that backward compatibility applies only to the source code. Binary compatibility is not guaranteed, which leads to problems, especially when an existing operation got a new return type, because overloading by the return type only is not allowed  for example, this applies to some STL algorithms and to some member functions of STL containers . So, compiling all parts, including the libraries, of a C++98 program using a C++11 compiler should usually work. Linking code compiled using a C++11 compiler with code compiled using a C++98 compiler might fail.   10  Chapter 2: Introduction to C++ and the Standard Library  2.2 Complexity and Big-O Notation  For certain parts of the C++ standard library — especially for the STL — the performance of algo- rithms and member functions was considered carefully. Thus, the standard requires a certain com- plexity of them. Computer scientists use a specialized notation to express the relative complexity of an algorithm. Using this measure, one can quickly categorize the relative runtime of an algorithm, as well as perform qualitative comparisons between algorithms. This measure is called Big-O notation. Big-O notation expresses the runtime of an algorithm as a function of a given input of size n. For example, if the runtime grows linearly with the number of elements — doubling the input doubles the runtime — the complexity is O n . If the runtime is independent of the input, the complexity is O 1 . Table 2.1 lists typical values of complexity and their Big-O notation.  Type Constant Logarithmic O log n    Notation O 1   Linear  n-log-n  O n  O n ∗ log n    Quadratic  O n2   Meaning The runtime is independent of the number of elements. The runtime grows logarithmically with respect to the number of elements. The runtime grows linearly  with the same factor  as the number of elements grows. The runtime grows as a product of linear and logarithmic com- plexity. The runtime grows quadratically with respect to the number of elements.  Table2.1. TypicalValuesofComplexity  It is important to observe that Big-O notation hides factors with smaller exponents, such as con- stant factors. In particular, it doesn’t matter how long an algorithm takes. Any two linear algorithms are considered equally acceptable by this measure. There may even be some situations in which the constant is so huge in a linear algorithm that even an exponential algorithm with a small constant would be preferable in practice. This is a valid criticism of Big-O notation. Just be aware that it is only a rule of thumb; the algorithm with optimal complexity is not necessarily the best one.  Table 2.2 lists all the categories of complexity with a certain number of elements to give you a feel of how fast the runtime grows with respect to the number of elements. As you can see, with a small number of elements, the running times don’t differ much. Here, constant factors that are hidden by Big-O notation may have a big inﬂuence. However, the more elements you have, the bigger the differences in the running times, so constant factors become meaningless. Remember to “think big” when you consider complexity.  Some complexity deﬁnitions in the C++ reference manual are speciﬁed as amortized. This means that the operations in the long term behave as described. However, a single operation may take longer than speciﬁed. For example, if you append elements to a dynamic array, the runtime depends on whether the array has enough memory for one more element. If there is enough memory, the complexity is constant because inserting a new last element always takes the same time. However, if there is not enough memory, the complexity is linear because, depending on the number of elements, you have to allocate new memory and copy all elements. Reallocations are rather rare, so any   2.2 Complexity and Big-O Notation  11  Complexity  Notation O 1   Type Constant Logarithmic O log n   Linear n-log-n Quadratic  O n  O n ∗ log n   O n2   Number of Elements  1 1 1 1 1 1  2 1 2 2 4 4  5 1 3 5 15 25  10 1 4 10 40 100  50 1 6 50 300 2,500  100 1 7 100 700 10,000  1,000 1 10 1,000 10,000 1,000,000  10,000 1 13 10,000 130,000 100,000,000  Table2.2.

Thus, the complexity of the insertion is “amortized” constant time.   This page intentionally left blank    Chapter 3 New Language Features  The core language and the library of C++ are usually standardized in parallel. In this way, the library can beneﬁt from improvements in the language, and the language can beneﬁt from experiences of library implementation. As a result, a C++ standard library always uses speciﬁc language features, which might not be available with previous versions of the standard.  Thus, C++11 is not the same language as C++98 C++03, and C++98 C++03 differs from C++ before it was standardized. If you didn’t follow its evolution, you may be surprised by the new language features the library uses. This chapter gives you a brief overview of the new features of C++11, which are important for the design, understanding, or application of the C++11 standard library. The end of this chapter covers some of the features that were available before C++11 but are still not widely known.  While I was writing this book  in 2010 and 2011 , not all compilers were able to provide all the new language features of C++11. I expect that this will soon change because all major C++ compiler vendors were part of the standardization process. But for some period of time, you may be restricted in your use of the library. Throughout the book I’ll use footnotes to mention any restrictions that are typical and important.  3.1 New C++11 Language Features  3.1.1 Important Minor Syntax Cleanups  First, I’d like to introduce two new features of C++11 that are minor but important for your day-to- day programming.  Spaces in Template Expressions  The requirement to put a space between two closing template expressions has gone:  vector  >; vector >;     OK in each C++ version    OK since C++11  Throughout the book  as in real code  you will ﬁnd both forms.   14  Chapter 3: New Language Features  nullptr and std::nullptr_t  C++11 lets you use nullptr instead of 0 or NULL to specify that a pointer refers to no value  which differs from having an undeﬁned value . This new feature especially helps to avoid mistakes that occurred when a null pointer was interpreted as an integral value. For example:  void f int ; void f void* ;  f 0 ; f NULL ; f nullptr ;     calls f int     calls f int  if NULL is 0, ambiguous otherwise    calls f void*   nullptr is a new keyword. It automatically converts into each pointer type but not to any integral type. It has type std::nullptr_t, deﬁned in    see Section 5.8.1, page 161 , so you can now even overload operations for the case that a null pointer is passed. Note that std::nullptr_t counts as a fundamental data type  see Section 5.4.2, page 127 .  3.1.2 Automatic Type Deduction with auto  With C++11, you can declare a variable or an object without specifying its speciﬁc type by using auto.1 For example:  auto i = 42; double f  ; auto d = f  ;     i has type int     d has type double  The type of a variable declared with auto is deduced from its initializer. Thus, an initialization is required:  auto i;     ERROR: can’t dedulce the type of i  Additional qualiﬁers are allowed. For example:  static auto vat = 0.19;  Using auto is especially useful where the type is a pretty long and or complicated expression. For example:  vector  v; ... auto pos = v.begin  ;     pos has type vector ::iterator  auto l = []  int x  -> bool {     l has the type of a lambda    taking an int and returning a bool  ...,  };  The latter is an object, representing a lambda, which is introduced in Section 3.1.10, page 28.  1 Note that auto is an old keyword of C. As the counterpart of static, declaring a variable as local, it was never used, because not specifying something as static implicitly declared it as auto.   3.1 New C++11 Language Features  15  3.1.3 Uniform Initialization and Initializer Lists  Before C++11, programmers, especially novices, could easily become confused by the question of how to initialize a variable or an object. Initialization could happen with parentheses, braces, and or assignment operators.  For this reason, C++11 introduced the concept of uniform initialization, which means that for any initialization, you can use one common syntax. This syntax uses braces, so the following is possible now:  int values[] { 1, 2, 3 }; std::vector  v { 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17 }; std::vector  cities {  "Berlin", "New York", "London", "Braunschweig", "Cairo", "Cologne"  }; std::complex  c{4.0,3.0};     equivalent to c 4.0,3.0   An initializer list forces so-called value initialization, which means that even local variables of fundamental data types, which usually have an undeﬁned initial value, are initialized by zero  or nullptr, if it is a pointer :  int i; int j{}; int* p; int* q{};     i has undeﬁned value    j is initialized by 0    p has undeﬁned value    q is initialized by nullptr  Note, however, that narrowing initializations — those that reduce precision or where the supplied value gets modiﬁed — are not possible with braces. For example:    OK, but OUCH: x1 becomes 5    OK, but OUCH: x2 becomes 5    ERROR: narrowing    ERROR: narrowing    OK: even though 7 is an int, this is not narrowing    ERROR: narrowing  if 99999 doesn’t ﬁt into a char   int x1 5.3 ; int x2 = 5.3; int x3{5.0}; int x4 = {5.3}; char c1{7}; char c2{99999}; std::vector  v1 { 1, 2, 4, 5 }; std::vector  v2 { 1, 2.3, 4, 5.6 };     OK    ERROR: narrowing doubles to ints  As you can see, to check whether narrowing applies, even the current values might be considered, if available at compile time. As Bjarne Stroustrup writes in [Stroustrup:FAQ] regarding this example: “The way C++11 avoids a lot of incompatibilities is by relying on the actual values of initializers  such as 7 in the example above  when it can  and not just type  when deciding what is a narrowing conversion. If a value can be represented exactly as the target type, the conversion is not narrowing. Note that ﬂoating-point to integer conversions are always considered narrowing — even 7.0 to 7.” To support the concept of initializer lists for user-deﬁned types, C++11 provides the class tem- plate std::initializer_list . It can be used to support initializations by a list of values or in any other place where you want to process just a list of values. For example:   }  }  class P {  public:  };  16  Chapter 3: New Language Features  void print  std::initializer_list  vals  {  for  auto p=vals.begin  ; p!=vals.end  ; ++p  {     process a list of values  std::cout << *p << "\n";  print  {12,3,5,7,11,13,17} ;     pass a list of values to print    When there are constructors for both a speciﬁc number of arguments and an initializer list, the version with the initializer list is preferred:  P int,int ; P std::initializer_list  ;  P p 77,5 ; P q{77,5}; P r{77,5,42}; P s = {77,5};     calls P::P int,int     calls P::P initializer_list     calls P::P initializer_list     calls P::P initializer_list   Without the constructor for the initializer list, the constructor taking two ints would be called to initialize q and s, while the initialization of r would be invalid.  Because of initializer lists, explicit now also becomes relevant for constructors taking more than one argument. So, you can now disable automatic type conversions from multiple values, which is also used when an initialization uses the = syntax:  class P {  public:  P int a, int b  {  ...  ...  }  };  } explicit P int a, int b, int c  {  P x 77,5 ; P y{77,5}; P z {77,5,42}; P v = {77,5}; P w = {77,5,42};     OK    OK    OK    OK  implicit type conversion allowed     ERROR due to explicit  no implicit type conversion allowed    3.1 New C++11 Language Features  17  void fp const P& ;  fp {47,11} ; fp {47,11,3} ; fp P{47,11} ; fp P{47,11,3} ;     OK, implicit conversion of {47,11} into P    ERROR due to explicit    OK, explicit conversion of {47,11} into P    OK, explicit conversion of {47,11,3} into P  In the same manner, an explicit constructor taking an initializer list disables implicit conversions for initializer lists with zero, one, or more initial values.  3.1.4 Range-Based for Loops  C++11 introduces a new form of for loop, which iterates over all elements of a given range, array, or collection. It’s what in other programming languages would be called a foreach loop. The general syntax is as follows:  for   decl : coll   {  statement  where decl is the declaration of each element of the passed collection coll and for which the state- ments speciﬁed are called. For example, the following calls for each value of the passed initializer list the speciﬁed statement, which writes it on a line to the standard output cout:  for   int i : { 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 13, 17, 19 }   {  std::cout << i << std::endl;  To multiply each element elem of a vector vec by 3 you can program as follows:  std::vector  vec; ... for   auto& elem : vec   {  elem *= 3;  }  }  }  Here, declaring elem as a reference is important because otherwise the statements in the body of the for loop act on a local copy of the elements in the vector  which sometimes also might be useful . This means that to avoid calling the copy constructor and the destructor for each element, you should usually declare the current element to be a constant reference. Thus, a generic function to print all elements of a collection should be implemented as follows:  template   void printElements  const T& coll  {  for  const auto& elem : coll  {  std::cout << elem << std::endl;  }  }   18  Chapter 3: New Language Features  Here, the range-based for statement is equivalent to the following:  for  auto _pos=coll.begin  ; _pos != coll.end  ; ++_pos   {  const auto& elem = *_pos; std::cout << elem << std::endl;  In general, a range-based for loop declared as  for   decl : coll   {  statement  is equivalent to the following, if coll provides begin   and end   members:  for  auto _pos=coll.begin  , _end=coll.end  ; _pos!=_end; ++_pos   {  decl = *_pos; statement  decl = *_pos; statement  or, if that doesn’t match, to the following by using a global begin   and end   taking coll as argument:  for  auto _pos=begin coll , _end=end coll ; _pos!=_end; ++_pos   {  As a result, you can use range-based for loops even for initializer lists because the class template std::initializer_list  provides begin   and end   members.  In addition, there is a rule that allows you to use ordinary C-style arrays of known size. For  example:  int array[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };  long sum=0; for  int x : array  {     process sum of all elements  sum += x;  for  auto elem : { sum, sum*2, sum*4 }   {    print some multiples of sum  std::cout << elem << std::endl;  }  }  }  {  }  }  {  }  {  }  }  }   3.1 New C++11 Language Features  19  15 30 60  };  }  }  has the following output:  class C {  public:  Note that no explicit type conversions are possible when elements are initialized as decl inside the for loop. Thus, the following does not compile:  explicit C const std::string& s ; ...     explicit !  type conversion from strings  std::vector  vs; for  const C& elem : vs  {  std::cout << elem << std::endl;     ERROR, no conversion from string to C deﬁned  3.1.5 Move Semantics and Rvalue References  One of the most important new features of C++11 is the support of move semantics. This feature goes further into the major design goal of C++ to avoid unnecessary copies and temporaries.  This new feature is so complex that I recommend using a more detailed introduction to this topic,  but I will try to give a brief introduction and summary here.2  Consider the following code example: void createAndInsert  std::set & coll  {     create an object of type X  X x; ... coll.insert x ;     insert it into the passed collection  Here, we insert a new object into a collection, which provides a member function that creates an internal copy of the passed element:  namespace std {  public:  template   class set {  ... insert  const T& v ;     copy value of v  2 This introduction is based on [Abrahams:RValues]  with friendly permission by Dave Abrahams , on [Becker:RValues]  with friendly permission by Thomas Becker , and some emails exchanged with Daniel Krugler, Dietmar Kuhl, and Jens Maurer.  ¨  ¨   20  ...  };  }  Chapter 3: New Language Features  This behavior is useful because the collection provides value semantics and the ability to insert temporary objects or objects that are used and modiﬁed after being inserted:  X x; coll.insert x ; ... coll.insert x+x ; ... coll.insert x ;     inserts copy of x     inserts copy of temporary rvalue     inserts copy of x  although x is not used any longer   However, for the last two insertions of x, it would be great to specify a behavior that the passed values  the result of x+x and x  are no longer used by the caller so that coll internally could avoid creating a copy and somehow move the contents of them into its new elements. Especially when copying x is expensive — for example, if it is a large collection of strings — this could become a big performance improvement.  Since C++11, such a behavior is possible. The programmer, however, has to specify that a move is possible unless a temporary is used. Although a compiler might ﬁnd this out in trivial cases, allowing the programmer to perform this task lets this feature be used in all cases, where logically appropriate. The preceding code simply has to get modiﬁed as follows:  X x; coll.insert x ; ... coll.insert x+x ; ... coll.insert std::move x  ;     inserts copy of x  OK, x is still used      moves  or copies  contents of temporary rvalue     moves  or copies  contents of x into coll  With std::move  , declared in  , x can be moved instead of being copied. However, std::move   doesn’t itself do any moving, but merely converts its argument into a so-called rvalue reference, which is a type declared with two ampersands: X&&. This new type stands for rvalues  anonymous temporaries that can appear only on the right-hand side of an assignment  that can be modiﬁed. The contract is that this is a  temporary  object that is not needed any longer so that you can steal its contents and or its resources.  Now, the collection can provide an overloaded version of insert  , which deals with these  rvalue references:  namespace std {  template   class set {  public:  ... insert  const T& x ; ... insert  T&& x ; ...     for lvalues: copies the value    for rvalues: moves the value  };  }   3.1 New C++11 Language Features  21  The version for rvalue references can now be optimized so that its implementation steals the contents of x. To do that, however, we need the help of the type of x, because only the type of x has access to its internals. So, for example, you could use internal arrays and pointers of x to initialize the inserted element, which would be a huge performance improvement if class x is itself a complex type, where you had to copy element-by-element instead. To initialize the new internal element, we simply call a so-called move constructor of class X, which steals the value of the passed argument to initialize a new object. All complex types should — and in the C++ standard library will — provide such a special constructor, which moves the contents of an existing element to a new element:  class X { public:  };  X  const X& lvalue ; X  X&& rvalue ; ...     copy constructor    move constructor  For example, the move constructor for strings typically just assigns the existing internal character array to the new object instead of creating a new array and copying all elements. The same applies to all collection classes: Instead of creating a copy of all elements, you just assign the internal memory to the new object. If no move constructor is provided, the copy constructor will be used.  In addition, you have to ensure that any modiﬁcation — especially a destruction — of the passed object, where the value was stolen from, doesn’t impact the state of the new object that now owns the value. Thus, you usually have to clear the contents of the passed argument  for example, by assigning nullptr to its internal member referring to its elements .  Clearing the contents of an object for which move semantics were called is, strictly speaking, not required, but not doing so makes the whole mechanism almost useless. In fact, for the classes of the C++ standard library in general, it is guaranteed that after a move, the objects are in a valid but unspeciﬁed state. That is, you can assign new values afterward, but the current value is not deﬁned. For STL containers, it is guaranteed that containers where the value was moved from are empty afterward.  In the same way, any nontrivial class should provide both a copy assignment and a move assign-  ment operator: class X { public:  };  X& operator=  const X& lvalue ;    copy assignment operator    move assignment operator X& operator=  X&& rvalue ; ...  For strings and collections these operators could be implemented by simply swapping the internal contents and resources. However, you should also clear the contents of *this because this object might hold resources, such as locks, for which it is better to release them sooner. Again, the move semantics don’t require that, but it is a quality of move support that, for example, is provided by the container classes of the C++ standard library.  Finally, note the following two remarks about this feature:  1  overloading rules for rvalue and  lvalue references and  2  returning rvalue references.   22  Chapter 3: New Language Features  Overloading Rules for Rvalue and Lvalue References  The overloading rules for rvalues and lvalues are as follows:3   If you implement only void foo X& ;  without void foo X&& , the behavior is as in C++98: foo   can be called for lvalues but not for rvalues.  without void foo X&& , the behavior is as in C++98: foo   can be called for rvalues and for lvalues.    If you implement  void foo const X& ;    If you implement  void foo X& ; void foo X&& ;  or  void foo const X& ; void foo X&& ;  you can distinguish between dealing with rvalues and lvalues. The version for rvalues is allowed to and should provide move semantics. Thus, it can steal the internal state and resources of the passed argument.   If you implement  void foo X&& ;  but neither void foo X&  nor void foo const X& , foo   can be called on rvalues, but trying to call it on an lvalue will trigger a compile error. Thus, only move semantics are provided here. This ability is used inside the library: for example, by unique pointers  see Section 5.2.5, page 98 , ﬁle streams  see Section 15.9.2, page 795 , or string streams  see Section 15.10.2, page 806 ,  This means that if a class does not provide move semantics and has only the usual copy constructor and copy assignment operator, these will be called for rvalue references. Thus, std::move   means to call move semantics, if provided, and copy semantics otherwise.  Returning Rvalue References  You don’t have to and should not move   return values. According to the language rules, the standard speciﬁes that for the following code:4  X foo    {  X x; ...  3 Thanks to Thomas Becker for providing this wording. 4 Thanks to Dave Abrahams for providing this wording.   3.1 New C++11 Language Features  23  the following behavior is guaranteed:   If X has an accessible copy or move constructor, the compiler may choose to elide the copy. This is the so-called  named  return value optimization   N RVO , which was speciﬁed even before C++11 and is supported by most compilers.    Otherwise, if X has a move constructor, x is moved.   Otherwise, if X has a copy constructor, x is copied.   Otherwise, a compile-time error is emitted. Note also that returning an rvalue reference is an error if the returned object is a local nonstatic object:  return x;  }  X&& foo    {  X x; ... return x;  }     ERROR: returns reference to nonexisting object  An rvalue reference is a reference, and returning it while referring to a local object means that you return a reference to an object that doesn’t exist any more. Whether std::move   is used doesn’t matter.  3.1.6 New String Literals  Since C++11, you can deﬁne raw string and multibyte wide-character string literals.  Raw String Literals  Such a raw string allows one to deﬁne a character sequence by writing exactly its contents as a raw character sequence. Thus, you save a lot of escapes necessary to mask special characters.  A raw string starts with R"  and ends with  ". The string might contain line breaks. For example, an ordinary string literal representing two backslashes and an n would be deﬁned as an ordinary string literal as follows:  and as a raw string literal as follows:  "\\\\n"  R" \\n "  To be able to have  " inside the raw string, you can use a delimiter. Thus, the complete syntax of a raw string is R"delim ... delim", where delim is a character sequence of at most 16 basic characters except the backslash, whitespaces, and parentheses.   24  Chapter 3: New Language Features  For example, the raw string literal  R"nc a\  b\nc  "  nc";  is equivalent to the following ordinary string literal:  "a\\\n  b\\nc  \"\n  "  Thus, the string contains an a, a backslash, a newline character, some spaces, a b, a backslash, an n, a c, a double quote character, a newline character, and some spaces.  Raw string literals are especially useful when deﬁning regular expressions. See Chapter 14 for  details.  Encoded String Literals  By using an encoding preﬁx, you can deﬁne a special character encoding for string literals. The following encoding preﬁxes are deﬁned:   u8 deﬁnes a UTF-8 encoding. A UTF-8 string literal is initialized with the given characters as encoded in UTF-8. The characters have type const char.   u deﬁnes a string literal with characters of type char16_t.   U deﬁnes a string literal with characters of type char32_t.   L deﬁnes a wide string literal with characters of type wchar_t. For example: L"hello"     deﬁnes ‘‘hello’’ as wchar_t string literal  The initial R of a raw string can be preceded by an encoding preﬁx.  See Chapter 16 for details about using different encodings for internationalization.  3.1.7 Keyword noexcept  C++11 provides the keyword noexcept. It can be used to specify that a function cannot throw — or is not prepared to throw. For example:  void foo    noexcept;  declares that foo   won’t throw. If an exception is not handled locally inside foo   — thus, if foo   throws — the program is terminated, calling std::terminate  , which by default calls std::abort    see Section 5.8.2, page 162 .  noexcept targets a lot of problems  empty  exception speciﬁcations have. To quote from  [N3051:DeprExcSpec]  with friendly permission by Doug Gregor :    Runtime checking: C++ exception speciﬁcations are checked at runtime rather than at compile time, so they offer no programmer guarantees that all exceptions have been handled. The runtime failure mode  calling std::unexpected    does not lend itself to recovery.   Runtime overhead: Runtime checking requires the compiler to produce additional  code that also hampers optimizations.   3.1 New C++11 Language Features  25    Unusable in generic code: Within generic code, it is not generally possible to know what types of exceptions may be thrown from operations on template arguments, so a precise exception speciﬁcation cannot be written.  In practice, only two forms of exception-throwing guarantees are useful: An operation might throw an exception  any exception  or an operation will never throw any excep- tion. The former is expressed by omitting the exception-speciﬁcation entirely, while the latter can be expressed as throw   but rarely is, due to performance considerations.  Especially because noexcept does not require stack unwinding, programmers can now express the nothrow guarantee without additional overhead. As a result, the use of exception speciﬁcations is deprecated since C++11.  You can even specify a condition under which a function throws no exception. For example, for  any type Type, the global swap   usually is deﬁned as follows:  void swap  Type& x, Type& y  noexcept noexcept x.swap y    {  x.swap y ;  }  Here, inside noexcept ... , you can specify a Boolean condition under which no exception gets thrown: Specifying noexcept without condition is a short form of specifying noexcept true .  In this case, the condition is noexcept x.swap y  . Here, the operator noexcept is used, which yields true if an evaluated expression, which is speciﬁed within parentheses, can’t throw an exception. Thus, the global swap   speciﬁes that it does not throw an exception if the member function swap   called for the ﬁrst argument does not throw.  As another example, the move assignment operator for value pairs is declared as follows: pair& operator=  pair&& p   noexcept is_nothrow_move_assignable ::value &&  is_nothrow_move_assignable ::value ;  Here, the is_nothrow_move_assignable type trait is used, which checks whether for the passed type, a move assignment that does not throw is possible  see Section 5.4.2, page 127 .  According to [N3279:LibNoexcept], noexcept was introduced inside the library with the fol- lowing conservative approach  words and phrases in italics are quoted literally :   Each library function ... that ... cannot throw and does not specify any undeﬁned behavior — for example, caused by a broken precondition — should be marked as unconditionally noexcept.   If a library swap function, move constructor, or move assignment operator ... can be proven not to throw by applying the noexcept operator, it should be marked as conditionally noexcept. No other function should use a conditional noexcept speciﬁcation.   No library destructor should throw. It must use the implicitly supplied  nonthrowing  exception   Library functions designed for compatibility with C code ... may be marked as unconditionally  speciﬁcation.  noexcept.  Note that noexcept was deliberately not applied to any C++ function having a precondition that, if violated, could result in undeﬁned behavior. This allows library implementations to provide a “safe mode” throwing a “precondition violation” exception in the event of misuse.   Throughout this book I usually skip noexcept speciﬁcations to improve readability and save  Chapter 3: New Language Features  26  space.  3.1.8 Keyword constexpr  Since C++11, constexpr can be used to enable that expressions be evaluated at compile time. For example:  constexpr int square  int x  {  return x * x;  } float a[square 9 ];     OK since C++11: a has 81 elements  This keyword ﬁxes a problem C++98 had when using numeric limits  see Section 5.3, page 115 . Before C++11, an expression such as  std::numeric_limits ::max    could not be used as an integral constant, although it was functionally equivalent to the macro INT_MAX. Now, with C++11, such an expression is declared as constexpr so that, for example, you can use it to declare arrays or in compile-time computations  metaprogramming :  std::array ::max  > a;  Throughout this book I usually skip constexpr speciﬁcations to improve readability and save space.  3.1.9 New Template Features  Variadic Templates  Since C++11, templates can have parameters that accept a variable number of template arguments. This ability is called variadic templates. For example, you can use the following to call print   for a variable number of arguments of different types:  void print    { }  template   void print  const T& firstArg, const Types&... args  {  std::cout << firstArg << std::endl; print args... ;     print ﬁrst argument    call print   for remaining arguments  }  If one or more arguments are passed, the function template is used, which by specifying the ﬁrst argument separately allows the ﬁrst argument to print and then recursively calls print   for the remaining arguments. To end the recursion, the non-template overload of print   is provided.   3.1 New C++11 Language Features  27  For example, an input such as  print  7.5, "hello", std::bitset  377 , 42 ;  would output the following  see Section 12.5.1, page 652 for details of bitsets :  7.5 hello 0000000101111001 42  Note that it is currently under discussion whether the following example also is valid. The reason is that formally for a single argument the variadic form is ambiguous with the nonvariadic form for a single argument; however, compilers usually accept this code:  template   void print  const T& arg  {  std::cout << arg << std::endl;  }  }  template   void print  const T& firstArg, const Types&... args  {  std::cout << firstArg << std::endl; print args... ;     print ﬁrst argument    call print   for remaining arguments  Inside variadic templates, sizeof... args  yields the number of arguments.  Class std::tuple  makes heavy use of this feature  see Section 5.1.2, page 68 .  Alias Templates  Template Typedef   Since C++11, template  partial  type deﬁnitions also are supported. However, because all approaches with the typename keyword failed for some reason, the keyword using was introduced here, and the term alias template is used for it. For example, after  template   using Vec = std::vector >;     standard vector using own allocator  the term  Vec  coll;  is equivalent to  std::vector > coll; See Section 5.2.5, page 108, for another example.  Other New Template Features  Since C++11, function templates  see Section 3.2, page 34  may have default template arguments. In addition, local types can be used now as template arguments, and functions with internal linkage can now be used as arguments to nontype templates of function pointers or function references.   28  Chapter 3: New Language Features  3.1.10 Lambdas  C++11 introduced lambdas, allowing the deﬁnition of inline functionality, which can be used as a parameter or a local object.  Lambdas change the way the C++ standard library is used. For example, Section 6.9, page 229, and Section 10.3, page 499, discuss how to use lambdas with STL algorithms and containers. Sec- tion 18.1.2, page 958, demonstrates how to use lambdas to deﬁne code that can run concurrently.  Syntax of Lambdas  A lambda is a deﬁnition of functionality that can be deﬁned inside statements and expressions. Thus, you can use a lambda as an inline function.  The minimal lambda function has no parameters and simply does something. For example: [] {  std::cout << "hello lambda" << std::endl;  You can call it directly:  }  [] {  }   ;  or pass it to objects to get called:  auto l = [] {  std::cout << "hello lambda" << std::endl;     prints ‘‘hello lambda’’  std::cout << "hello lambda" << std::endl;  };  ... l  ;     prints ‘‘hello lambda’’  As you can see, a lambda is always introduced by a so-called lambda introducer: brackets within which you can specify a so-called capture to access nonstatic outside objects inside the lambda. When there is no need to have access to outside data, the brackets are just empty, as is the case here. Static objects such as std::cout can be used.  Between the lambda introducer and the lambda body, you can specify parameters, mutable, an exception speciﬁcation, attribute speciﬁers, and the return type. All of them are optional, but if one of them occurs, the parentheses for the parameters are mandatory. Thus, the syntax of a lambda is either  [...]  {...}  or  [...]   ...   mutableopt throwSpecopt ->retTypeopt {...}  A lambda can have parameters speciﬁed in parentheses, just like any other function:  auto l = []  const std::string& s  {  std::cout << s << std::endl;  };  l "hello lambda" ;     prints ‘‘hello lambda’’   3.1 New C++11 Language Features  29  Note, however, that lambdas can’t be templates. You always have to specify all types.  A lambda can also return something. Without any speciﬁc deﬁnition of the return type, it is  deduced from the return value. For example, the return type of the following lambda is int:  To specify a return type, you can use the new syntax C++ also provides for ordinary functions  see Section 3.1.12, page 32 . For example, the following lambda returns 42.0:  [] {  return 42;  []    -> double {  return 42;  }  }  In this case, you have to specify the return type after the parentheses for the arguments, which are required then, and the characters “->.”  Between the parameters and the return speciﬁcation or body, you can also specify an exception speciﬁcation like you can do for functions. However, as for functions exception speciﬁcations are deprecated now  see Section 3.1.7, page 24 .  Captures  Access to Outer Scope   Inside the lambda introducer  brackets at the beginning of a lambda , you can specify a capture to access data of outer scope that is not passed as an argument:   [=] means that the outer scope is passed to the lambda by value. Thus, you can read but not   [&] means that the outer scope is passed to the lambda by reference. Thus, you have write access to all data that was valid when the lambda was deﬁned, provided that you had write access there.  modify all data that was readable where the lambda was deﬁned.  You can also specify individually for each object that inside the lambda you have access to it by value or by reference. So, you can limit the access and mix different kinds of access. For example, the following statements:  int x=0; int y=42; auto qqq = [x, &y] {  std::cout << "x: " << x << std::endl; std::cout << "y: " << y << std::endl; ++y;    OK  };  x = y = 77; qqq  ; qqq  ; std::cout << "final y: " << y << std::endl;   30  Chapter 3: New Language Features  produce the following output:  x: 0 y: 77 x: 0 y: 78 final y: 79  Because x gets copied by value, you are not allowed to modify it inside the lambda; calling ++x inside the lambda would not compile. Because y is passed by reference, you have write access to it and are affected by any value change; so calling the lambda twice increments the assigned value 77. Instead of [x, &y], you could also have speciﬁed [=, &y] to pass y by reference and all other  objects by value.  To have a mixture of passing by value and passing by reference, you can declare the lambda as mutable. In that case, objects are passed by value, but inside the function object deﬁned by the lambda, you have write access to the passed value. For example:  std::cout << "id: " << id << std::endl; ++id;     OK  int id = 0; auto f = [id]    mutable {  };  id = 42; f  ; f  ; f  ; std::cout << id << std::endl;  has the following output:  You can consider the behavior of the lambda to be like the following function object  see Sec- tion 6.10, page 233 :  class {  private:  public:  int id;     copy of outside id  void operator      {  std::cout << "id: " << id << std::endl; ++id;     OK  id: 0 id: 1 id: 2 42  }  };   3.1 New C++11 Language Features  31  Due to mutable, operator    is deﬁned as a nonconstant member function, which means that write access to id is possible. So, with mutable, a lambda becomes stateful even if the state is passed by value. Without mutable, which is the usual case, operator    becomes a constant member function so that you only have read access to objects that were passed by value. See Section 10.3.2, page 501, for another example of using mutable with lambdas, which also discusses possible problems.  Type of Lambdas  The type of a lambda is an anonymous function object  or functor  that is unique for each lambda expression. Thus, to declare objects of that type, you need templates or auto. If you need the type, you can use decltype    see Section 3.1.11, page 32 , which is, for example, required to pass a lambda as hash function or ordering or sorting criterion to associative or unordered containers. See Section 6.9, page 232, and Section 7.9.7, page 379, for details.  Alternatively, you can use the std::function  class template, provided by the C++ standard library, to specify a general type for functional programming  see Section 5.4.4, page 133 . That class template provides the only way to specify the return type of a function returning a lambda:     lang lambda1.cpp  include  include   std::function  returnLambda    {  return []  int x, int y  {  return x*y;  };  int main   {  }  }  42  auto lf = returnLambda  ; std::cout << lf 6,7  << std::endl;  The output of the program is  of course :   32  Chapter 3: New Language Features  3.1.11 Keyword decltype  By using the new decltype keyword, you can let the compiler ﬁnd out the type of an expres- sion. This is the realization of the often requested typeof feature. However, the existing typeof implementations were inconsistent and incomplete, so C++11 introduced a new keyword. For example:  std::map  coll; decltype coll ::value_type elem;  One application of decltype is to declare return types  see below . Another is to use it in metapro- gramming  see Section 5.4.1, page 125  or to pass the type of a lambda  see Section 10.3.4, page 504 .  3.1.12 New Function Declaration Syntax  Sometimes, the return type of a function depends on an expression processed with the arguments. However, something like  template   decltype x+y  add T1 x, T2 y ;  was not possible before C++11, because the return expression uses objects not introduced or in scope yet.  But with C++11, you can alternatively declare the return type of a function behind the parameter  list:  template   auto add T1 x, T2 y  -> decltype x+y ;  This uses the same syntax as for lambdas to declare return types  see Section 3.1.10, page 28 .  3.1.13 Scoped Enumerations  C++11 allows the deﬁnition of scoped enumerations — also called strong enumerations, or enumer- ation classes — which are a cleaner implementation of enumeration values  enumerators  in C++. For example:  enum class Salutation : char { mr, ms, co, none };  The important point is to specify keyword class behind enum. Scoped enumerations have the following advantages:   Implicit conversions to and from int are not possible.   Values like mr are not part of the scope where the enumeration is declared. You have to use   You can explicitly deﬁne the underlying type  char here  and have a guaranteed size  if you skip   Forward declarations of the enumeration type are possible, which eliminates the need to recom-  “: char” here, int is the default .  Salutation::mr instead.  pile compilation units for new enumerations values if only the type is used.   3.2 Old “New” Language Features  33  Note that with the type trait std::underlying_type, you can evaluate the underlying type of an enumeration type  see Section 5.4.2, page 130 .  As an example, error condition values of standard exceptions are scoped enumerators  see Sec-  tion 4.3.2, page 45 .  3.1.14 New Fundamental Data Types  The following new fundamental data types are deﬁned in C++11:   char16_t and char32_t  see Section 16.1.3, page 852    long long and unsigned long long   std::nullptr_t  see Section 3.1.1, page 14   3.2 Old “New” Language Features  Although C++98 is more than 10 years old now, programmers still can be surprised by some of the language features. Some of those are presented in this section.  Nontype Template Parameters  In addition to type parameters, it is also possible to use nontype parameters. A nontype parameter is then considered part of the type. For example, for the standard class bitset   see Section 12.5, page 650 , you can pass the number of bits as the template argument. The following statements deﬁne two bitﬁelds: one with 32 bits and one with 50 bits:  bitset  flags32; bitset  flags50;     bitset with 32 bits    bitset with 50 bits  These bitsets have different types because they use different template arguments. Thus, you can’t assign or compare them unless a corresponding type conversion is provided.  Default Template Parameters  Class templates may have default arguments. For example, the following declaration allows one to declare objects of class MyClass with one or two template arguments:  template  > class MyClass;  If you pass only one argument, the default parameter is used as the second argument:  MyClass  x1;     equivalent to: MyClass >  Note that default template arguments may be deﬁned in terms of previous arguments.   34  Chapter 3: New Language Features  Keyword typename  The keyword typename was introduced to specify that the identiﬁer that follows is a type. Consider the following example:  template   class MyClass {  typename T::SubType * ptr; ...  Here, typename is used to clarify that SubType is a type deﬁned within class T. Thus, ptr is a pointer to the type T::SubType. Without typename, SubType would be considered a static member, and thus  T::SubType * ptr  would be a multiplication of value SubType of type T with ptr.  According to the qualiﬁcation of SubType being a type, any type that is used in place of T must provide an inner type SubType. For example, the use of type Q as a template argument is possible only if type Q has an inner type deﬁnition for SubType:  };  };  };  class Q {  typedef int SubType; ...  MyClass  x;     OK  class Q {  class SubType; ...  In this case, the ptr member of MyClass  would be a pointer to type int. However, the subtype could also be an abstract data type, such as a class:  Note that typename is always necessary to qualify an identiﬁer of a template as being a type, even if an interpretation that is not a type would make no sense. Thus, the general rule in C++ is that any identiﬁer of a template is considered to be a value except if it is qualiﬁed by typename.  Apart from this, typename can also be used instead of class in a template declaration: template   class MyClass;  Member Templates  Member functions of classes may be templates. However, member templates may not be virtual. For example:   3.2 Old “New” Language Features  35  class MyClass {  ... template   void f T ;  };  template   class MyClass {  private:  T value;  public:  Here, MyClass::f declares a set of member functions for parameters of any type. You can pass any argument as long as its type provides all operations used by f  .  This feature is often used to support automatic type conversions for members in class templates. For example, in the following deﬁnition, the argument x of assign   must have exactly the same type as the object it is called for:  void assign  const MyClass & x  {    x must have same type as *this  value = x.value;  } ...  };  void f   {  }  It would be an error to use different template types for the objects of the assign   operation even if an automatic type conversion from one type to the other is provided:  MyClass  d; MyClass  i;  d.assign d ; d.assign i ;     OK    ERROR: i is MyClass      but MyClass  is required  By providing a different template type for the member function, you relax the rule of exact match. The member function template argument may have any template type, then, as long as the types are assignable:  template   class MyClass {  private:  T value;  public:  template   void assign  const MyClass & x  {     member template    allows different template types  value = x.getValue  ;  }   36  Chapter 3: New Language Features  d.assign d ; d.assign i ;     OK    OK  int is assignable to double   Note that the argument x of assign   now differs from the type of *this. Thus, you can’t access private and protected members of MyClass  directly. Instead, you have to use something like getValue   in this example.  A special form of a member template is a template constructor. Template constructors are usu- ally provided to enable implicit type conversions when objects are copied. Note that a template constructor does not suppress the implicit declaration of the copy constructor. If the type matches exactly, the implicit copy constructor is generated and called. For example:  T getValue    const {  return value;  } ...  };  void f   {  MyClass  d; MyClass  i;  }  }  template   class MyClass {  public:     copy constructor with implicit type conversion    - does not suppress implicit copy constructor template   MyClass  const MyClass & x ; ...  };  void f   {  MyClass  xd; ... MyClass  xd2 xd ; MyClass  xi xd ; ...     calls implicitly generated copy constructor    calls template constructor  Here, the type of xd2 is the same as the type of xd and so is initialized via the implicitly generated copy constructor. The type of xi differs from the type of xd and so is initialized by using the template constructor. Thus, if you implement a template constructor, don’t forget to provide a default constructor if its default behavior does not ﬁt your needs. See Section 5.1.1, page 60, for another example of member templates.   3.2 Old “New” Language Features  37  Nested Class Templates  Nested classes may also be templates:  template   class MyClass {  ... template   class NestedClass; ...  };  3.2.1 Explicit Initialization for Fundamental Types  If you use the syntax of an explicit constructor call without arguments, fundamental types are ini- tialized with zero:  int i1; int i2 = int  ; int i3{};     undeﬁned value    initialized with zero    initialized with zero  since C++11   This feature enables you to write template code that ensures that values of any type have a certain default value. For example, in the following function, the initialization guarantees that x is initialized with zero for fundamental types:  template   void f   {  T x = T  ; ...  }  int main   {  ...  } and  If a template forces the initialization with zero, its value is so-called zero initialized. Otherwise it’s default initialized.  3.2.2 Deﬁnition of main    I’d also like to clarify an important, often misunderstood, aspect of the core language: namely, the only correct and portable versions of main  . According to the C++ standard, only two deﬁnitions of main   are portable:   Chapter 3: New Language Features  int main  int argc, char* argv[]  {  38  ...  }  an implicit  return 0;  where argv  the array of command-line arguments  might also be deﬁned as char**. Note that the return type int is required.  You may, but are not required to, end main   with a return statement. Unlike C, C++ deﬁnes  at the end of main  . This means that every program that leaves main   without a return statement is successful. Any value other than 0 represents a kind of failure  see Section 5.8.2, page 162, for predeﬁned values . Therefore, my examples in this book have no return statement at the end of main  .  To end a C++ program without returning from main  , you usually should call exit  ,  quick_exit    since C++11 , or terminate  . See Section 5.8.2, page 162, for details.   Chapter 4 General Concepts  This chapter describes the fundamental C++ standard library concepts that you need to work with all or most components:   The namespace std   The names and formats of header ﬁles   The general concept of error and exception handling   Callable objects   Basic concepts about concurrency and multithreading   A brief introduction to allocators  4.1 Namespace std  If you use different modules and or libraries, you always have the potential for name clashes. This is because modules and libraries might use the same identiﬁer for different things. This problem was solved by the introduction of namespaces to C++. A namespace is a certain scope for identiﬁers. Unlike a class, a namespace is open for extensions that might occur at any source. Thus, you could use a namespace to deﬁne components that are distributed over several physical modules. A typical example of such a component is the C++ standard library, so it follows that it uses a namespace.  Note that the following namespaces nested within std are used inside the C++ standard library:  In fact, all identiﬁers of the C++ standard library are deﬁned in a namespace called std. With C++11, this also applies to identiﬁers that were introduced with TR1 and had namespace std::tr1 there  see Section 2.1, page 7 . In addition, namespace posix is reserved now, although it is not used by the C++ standard library.   std::rel_ops  see Section 5.5.3, page 138    std::chrono  see Section 5.7.1, page 144    std::placeholders  see Section 6.10.3, page 243    std::regex_constants  see Section 14.6, page 732    std::this_thread  see Section 18.3.7, page 981    40  Chapter 4: General Concepts  According to the concept of namespaces, you have three options when using an identiﬁer of the C++ standard library: 1. You can qualify the identiﬁer directly. For example, you can write std::ostream instead of  ostream. A complete statement might look like this:  std::cout << std::hex << 3.4 << std::endl;  2. You can use a using declaration. For example, the following code fragment introduces the local  ability to skip std:: for cout and endl:  using std::cout; using std::endl;  Thus, the example in option 1 could be written like this:  cout << std::hex << 3.4 << endl;  3. You can use a using directive. This is the easiest option. By using a using directive for namespace std, all identiﬁers of the namespace std are available as if they had been declared globally. Thus, the statement  using namespace std;  allows you to write  cout << hex << 3.4 << endl;  Note that in complex code, this might lead to accidental name clashes or, worse, to different behavior due to some obscure overloading rules. You should never use a using directive when the context is not clear, such as in header ﬁles.  The examples in this book are quite small, so for my own convenience, I usually use using directives throughout this book in complete example programs.  4.2 Header Files  The use of namespace std for all identiﬁers of the C++ standard library was introduced during the standardization process. This change is not backward compatible to old header ﬁles, in which iden- tiﬁers of the C++ standard library are declared in the global scope. In addition, some interfaces of classes changed during the standardization process  however, the goal was to stay backward compat- ible if possible . So, a new style for the names of standard header ﬁles was introduced, thus allowing vendors to stay backward compatible by providing the old header ﬁles.  The deﬁnition of new names for the standard header ﬁles was a good opportunity to standardize the extensions of header ﬁles. Previously, several extensions for header ﬁles were used; for example, .h, .hpp, and .hxx. However, the new standard extension for header ﬁles might be a surprise: Standard headers no longer have extensions. Hence, include statements for standard header ﬁles look like this:  include   include    This convention also applies to header ﬁles assumed from the C standard. C header ﬁles now have the new preﬁx c instead of the old extension .h:   4.3 Error and Exception Handling  41  include   include       was:      was:    Inside these header ﬁles, all identiﬁers are declared in namespace std.  One advantage of this naming scheme is that you can distinguish the old string header for char*  C functions from the new string header for the standard C++ class string:  include   include       C++ class string    char* functions from C  The new naming scheme of header ﬁles does not necessarily mean that the ﬁlenames of standard header ﬁles have no extensions from the point of view of the operating system. How include statements for standard header ﬁles are handled is implementation deﬁned. C++ systems might add an extension or even use built-in declarations without reading a ﬁle. In practice, however, most systems simply include the header from a ﬁle that has exactly the same name as used in the include statement. So, in most systems, C++ standard header ﬁles simply have no extension. In general, it is still a good idea to use a certain extension for your own header ﬁles to help identify them in a ﬁle system.  To maintain compatibility with C, the “old” standard C header ﬁles are still available. So if  necessary, you can still use, for example:  include    In this case, the identiﬁers are declared in both the global scope and namespace std. In fact, these headers behave as if they declare all identiﬁers in namespace std, followed by an explicit using declaration.  For the C++ header ﬁles in the “old” format, such as  , there is no speciﬁcation in the standard. Hence, they are not supported. In practice, most vendors will probably provide them to enable backward compatibility. Note that there were more changes in the headers than just the introduction of namespace std. In general, you should either use the old names of header ﬁles or switch to the new standardized names.  4.3 Error and Exception Handling  The C++ standard library is heterogeneous. It contains software from diverse sources that have different styles of design and implementation. Error and exception handling is a typical example of these differences. Parts of the library, such as string classes, support detailed error handling, checking for every possible problem that might occur and throwing an exception if there is an error. Other parts, such as the STL and valarrays, prefer speed over safety, so they rarely check for logical errors and throw exceptions only if runtime errors occur.  4.3.1 Standard Exception Classes  All exceptions thrown by the language or the library are derived from the base class exception, deﬁned in  . This class is the root of several standard exception classes, which form a hierarchy, as shown in Figure 4.1. These standard exception classes can be divided into three groups:   42  Chapter 4: General Concepts  exception  what     nested_exception   domain_error   invalid_argument   length_error   out_of_range   future_error  code     system_error  code     range_error   overflow_error   underflow_error   bad_array_new_length   logic_error   runtime_error   bad_cast   bad_typeid   bad_exception   bad_alloc   bad_weak_ptr   bad_function_call   ios_base::failure   Figure4.1. HierarchyofStandardExceptions  1. Language support 2. Logic errors 3. Runtime errors Logic errors usually can be avoided because the reason is inside the scope of a program, such as a precondition violation. Runtime exceptions are caused by a reason that is outside the scope of the program, such as not enough resources.  Exception Classes for Language Support  operator if a type conversion on a reference fails at runtime.  Exceptions for language support are used by language features. So in a way they are part of the core language rather than the library. These exceptions are thrown when the following operations fail:   An exception of class bad_cast, deﬁned in  , is thrown by the dynamic_cast   An exception of class bad_typeid, deﬁned in  , is thrown by the typeid opera- tor for runtime type identiﬁcation. If the argument to typeid is zero or the null pointer, this exception gets thrown.   An exception of class bad_exception, deﬁned in  , is used to handle unexpected exceptions. It can be thrown by the function unexpected  , which is called if a function throws an exception that is not listed in an exception speciﬁcation Note, however, that the use of excep- tion speciﬁcations is deprecated since C++11  see Section 3.1.7, page 24 .   4.3 Error and Exception Handling  43  These exceptions might also be thrown by library functions. For example, bad_cast might be thrown by use_facet  if a facet is not available in a locale  see Section 16.2.2, page 864 .  Exception Classes for Logic Errors  bitset  array of bits  is initialized with a char other than ’0’ or ’1’.  Exception classes for logic errors are usually derived from class logic_error. Logic errors are errors that, at least in theory, could be avoided by the program; for example, by performing additional tests of function arguments. Examples of such errors are a violation of logical preconditions or a class invariant. The C++ standard library provides the following classes for logic errors:   An exception of class invalid_argument is used to report invalid arguments, such as when a   An exception of class length_error is used to report an attempt to do something that exceeds   An exception of class out_of_range is used to report that an argument value is not in the   An exception of class domain_error is used to report a domain error.   Since C++11, an exception of class future_error is used to report logical errors when using asynchronous system calls  see Chapter 18 . Note that runtime errors in this domain are raised via class system_error.  expected range, such as when a wrong index is used in an array-like collection or string.  a maximum allowable size, such as appending too many characters to a string.  In general, classes for logic errors are deﬁned in  . However, class future_error is deﬁned in  .  Exception Classes for Runtime Errors  Exceptions derived from runtime_error are provided to report events that are beyond the scope of a program and are not easily avoidable. The C++ standard library provides the following classes for runtime errors:   An exception of class range_error is used to report a range error in internal computations. In the C++ standard library, the exception can occur since C++11 in conversions between wide strings and byte strings  see Section 16.4.4, page 901 .   An exception of class overflow_error is used to report an arithmetic overﬂow. In the C++ standard library the exception can occur if a bitset is converted into an integral value  see Sec- tion 12.5.1, page 652 .    An exception of class underflow_error is used to report an arithmetic underﬂow.   Since C++11, an exception of class system_error is used to report errors caused by the under- lying operating system. In the C++ standard library, this exception can be thrown in the context of concurrency, such as class thread, classes to control data races, and async    see Chapter 18 .   An exception of class bad_alloc, deﬁned in  , is thrown whenever the global operator new fails, except when the nothrow version of new is used. This is probably the most important runtime exception because it might occur at any time in any nontrivial program.  Since C++11, bad_array_new_length, derived from bad_alloc, will be thrown by new if the size passed to new is less than zero or such that the size of the allocated object would exceed the implementation-deﬁned limit  that is, if it’s a logic error rather than a runtime error .   44  Chapter 4: General Concepts  a weak pointer out of a shared pointer fails. See Section 5.2.2, page 89, for details.    An exception of class bad_weak_ptr, deﬁned in  , is thrown whenever the creation of   An exception of class bad_function_call, deﬁned in  , is thrown whenever a function wrapper object gets invoked but has no target. See Section 5.4.4, page 133, for details. In addition, for the I O part of the library, a special exception class called ios_base::failure is provided in  . An exception of this class may be thrown when a stream changes its state due to an error or end-of-ﬁle. Since C++11, this class is derived from system_error; before C++11, it was directly derived from class exception. The exact behavior of this exception class is described in Section 15.4.4, page 762.  Conceptionally, bad_alloc can be considered a system error. However, for historical reasons and because of its importance, implementations are encouraged to throw a bad_alloc rather than a system_error exception if an error represents an out-of-memory condition.  In general, classes for runtime errors are deﬁned in  . Class system_error, how-  ever, is deﬁned in  .  Exceptions Thrown by the Standard Library  As the previous description shows, almost all exception classes can be thrown by the C++ standard library. In particular, bad_alloc exceptions can be thrown whenever storage is allocated.  In addition, because library features might use code provided by the application programmer,  functions might throw any exception indirectly.  Any implementation of the standard library might also offer additional exception classes either as siblings or as derived classes. However, the use of these nonstandard classes makes code nonportable because you could not use another implementation of the standard library without breaking your code. So, you should always use only the standard exception classes.  Header Files for Exception Classes  The exception classes are deﬁned in many different header ﬁles. Thus, to be able to deal with all exceptions the library might throw, you have to include:  include   include   include   include   include   include   include       for classes exception and bad_exception    for most logic and runtime error classes    for system errors  since C++11     for out-of-memory exceptions    for I O exceptions    for errors with async   and futures  since C++11     for bad_cast and bad_typeid  4.3.2 Members of Exception Classes  To handle an exception in a catch clause, you may use the interface provided by the exception classes. For all classes, what   is provided; for some classes, code   also is provided.   4.3 Error and Exception Handling  45  The Member what    For all standard exception classes, only one member can be used to get additional information be- sides the type itself: the virtual member function what  , which returns a null-terminated byte string:  namespace std {  class exception {  public:  };  }  virtual const char* what   const noexcept; ...  The content of the string returned by what   is implementation deﬁned. Note that the string might be a null-terminated multibyte string that is suitable to convert and display as wstring  see Sec- tion 13.2.1, page 664 . The C-string returned by what   is valid until the exception object from which it is obtained gets destroyed or a new value is assigned to the exception object.  Error Codes versus Error Conditions  tation-speciﬁc. However, some error codes also are standardized.  For the exception classes system_error and future_error, there is an additional member to get details about the exception. However, before going into details, we have to introduce the difference between error codes and error conditions:   Error codes are light-weight objects that encapsulate error code values that might be implemen-   Error conditions are objects that provide portable abstractions of error descriptions. Depending on the context, for exceptions the C++ standard library sometimes speciﬁes error code and sometimes error conditions. In fact:   Class std::errc provides error conditions for std::system_error exceptions corresponding   Class std::io_errc provides an error code for std::ios_base::failure exceptions thrown   Class std::future_errc provides error codes for std::future_error exceptions thrown by  to standard system error numbers deﬁned in   or  .  by stream classes since C++11  see Section 15.4.4, page 762 .  the concurrency library  see Chapter 18 .  Tables 4.1 and 4.2 list the error condition values that are speciﬁed by the C++ standard library for system_error exceptions. These are scoped enumerators  see Section 3.1.13, page 32 , so the preﬁx std::errc:: has to be used. The values of these conditions are required to have the corresponding errno value deﬁned in   or   This is not the error code; the error codes usually will be implementation-speciﬁc.   46  Chapter 4: General Concepts  Error Condition address_family_not_supported address_in_use address_not_available already_connected argument_list_too_long argument_out_of_domain bad_address bad_file_descriptor bad_message broken_pipe connection_aborted connection_already_in_progress connection_refused connection_reset cross_device_link destination_address_required device_or_resource_busy directory_not_empty executable_format_error file_exists file_too_large filename_too_long function_not_supported host_unreachable identifier_removed illegal_byte_sequence inappropriate_io_control_operation interrupted invalid_argument invalid_seek io_error is_a_directory message_size network_down network_reset network_unreachable no_buffer_space no_child_process no_link no_lock_available no_message_available no_message no_protocol_option no_space_on_device no_stream_resources no_such_device_or_address no_such_device no_such_file_or_directory no_such_process not_a_directory not_a_socket  Enum Value EAFNOSUPPORT EADDRINUSE EADDRNOTAVAIL EISCONN E2BIG EDOM EFAULT EBADF EBADMSG EPIPE ECONNABORTED EALREADY ECONNREFUSED ECONNRESET EXDEV EDESTADDRREQ EBUSY ENOTEMPTY ENOEXEC EEXIST EFBIG ENAMETOOLONG ENOSYS EHOSTUNREACH EIDRM EILSEQ ENOTTY EINTR EINVAL ESPIPE EIO EISDIR EMSGSIZE ENETDOWN ENETRESET ENETUNREACH ENOBUFS ECHILD ENOLINK ENOLCK ENODATA ENOMSG ENOPROTOOPT ENOSPC ENOSR ENXIO ENODEV ENOENT ESRCH ENOTDIR ENOTSOCK  Table4.1.

ErrorConditionsofsystem_errors,Part2  Table 4.3 lists the error code values that are speciﬁed by the C++ standard library for exceptions of type future_errc. These are scoped enumerators  see Section 3.1.13, page 32 , so the preﬁx std::future_errc:: has to be used.1  The only error code speciﬁed for ios_base::failure exceptions is std::io_errc::stream.

ErrorCodesoffuture_errors  in the C++11 standard,  1 Note that future errors are deﬁned explicitly with future_errc::broken_promise having the value 0. But because error code 0 usually stands for “no error,” this was a design mistake. The ﬁx is that all future error code values are now deﬁned to be implementation- speciﬁc.  the error codes of   48  Chapter 4: General Concepts  Dealing with Error Codes and Error Conditions  For error codes and error conditions, two different types are provided by the C++ standard library: class std::error_code and class std::error_condition. This might lead to the impression that dealing with errors is pretty complicated. However, the library is designed so that you can always compare error codes with error conditions using both the objects or enumeration values. For example, for any error object ec of type std::error_code or std::error_condition the following is possible:  if  ec == std::errc::invalid_argument  {     check for speciﬁc error condition  } if  ec == std::future_errc::no_state  {     check for speciﬁc error code  ...  ...  }  Thus, when dealing with errors only to check for speciﬁc error codes or conditions, the difference between codes and conditions doesn’t matter.  To be able to deal with error codes and error conditions, class std::system_error, including its derived class std::ios_base::failure, and class std::_future_error provide the addi- tional nonvirtual member function code   returning an object of class std::error_code:2  namespace std {  public:  class system_error : public runtime_error {  virtual const char* what   const noexcept; const error_code& code   const noexcept; ...  };  public:  class future_error : public logic_error {  virtual const char* what   const noexcept; const error_code& code   const noexcept; ...  };  }  namespace std {  class error_code {  public:  Class error_code then provides member functions to get some details of the error:  2 Strictly speaking, these declarations are in different header ﬁles, and what   is not declared as virtual here but derives its virtuality from its base class.   4.3 Error and Exception Handling  49  const error_category& category   const noexcept; int string explicit operator bool   const noexcept; error_condition ...  value   const noexcept; message   const;  default_error_condition   const noexcept;  };  }  This interface is driven by the following design:   Different libraries might use the same integral values for different error codes. So, each error has a category and a value. Only inside a category is each value distinct and has a clear speciﬁed meaning.   message   yields a corresponding message, which usually is part of what what   yields in   operator bool   yields whether an error code is set  0 is the value that stands for “no error” .   default_error_condition   returns the corresponding error_condition, again providing  When exceptions are caught, this operator usually should yield true.  general for all exceptions, although this is not required.  category  , value  , message  , and operator bool  :  namespace std {  class error_condition {  public:  const error_category& category   const noexcept; int string explicit operator bool   const noexcept; ...  value   const noexcept; message   const;  Class std::error_category provides the following interface:  };  }  namespace std {  class error_category {  public:  virtual const char* virtual string virtual error_condition default_error_condition  int ev   name   const noexcept = 0; message  int ev  const = 0;  const noexcept; bool operator ==  const error_category& rhs  const noexcept; bool operator !=  const error_category& rhs  const noexcept; ...  };  }   50  Chapter 4: General Concepts  Here, name   yields the name of the category. message   and default_error_condition   return the message and the default error condition according to the passed value  this is what the corresponding error_code member functions call . Operators == and != allow you to compare error categories. The following category names are deﬁned by the C++ standard library:   "iostream" for I O stream exceptions of type ios_base::failure   "generic" for system exceptions of type system_error, where the value corresponds to a   "system" for system exceptions of type system_error, where the value does not correspond   "future" for exceptions of type future_error For each category, global functions are provided that return the category:3  to a POSIX errno value  POSIX errno value  const error_category& generic_category   noexcept; const error_category& system_category   noexcept; const error_category& iostream_category  ; const error_category& future_category   noexcept;     in      in      in      in    Thus, for an error code object e, you can also call the following to ﬁnd out whether it is an I O failure:  if  e.code  .category   == std::iostream_category     The following code demonstrates how to use a generic function to process  here, print  different exceptions:     util exception.hpp  include   include   include   include    template   void processCodeException  const T& e  {  using namespace std; auto c = e.code  ; cerr << "- category: cerr << "- value: cerr << "- msg: cerr << "- def category: "  " << c.category  .name   << endl; " << c.value   << endl; " << c.message   << endl;  << c.default_error_condition  .category  .name   << endl;  3 It’s probably an oversight that iostream_category   is not declared with noexcept.   4.3 Error and Exception Handling  51  cerr << "- def value:  cerr << "- def msg:  "  "  << c.default_error_condition  .value   << endl;  << c.default_error_condition  .message   << endl;  }  void processException   {  using namespace std; try {  throw;     rethrow exception to deal with it here  } catch  const ios_base::failure& e  {  cerr << "I O EXCEPTION: " << e.what   << endl; processCodeException e ;  } catch  const system_error& e  {  cerr << "SYSTEM EXCEPTION: " << e.what   << endl; processCodeException e ;  } catch  const future_error& e  {  cerr << "FUTURE EXCEPTION: " << e.what   << endl; processCodeException e ;  cerr << "BAD ALLOC EXCEPTION: " << e.what   << endl;  } catch  const bad_alloc& e  {  } catch  const exception& e  {  } catch  ...  {  cerr << "EXCEPTION: " << e.what   << endl;  cerr << "EXCEPTION  unknown " << endl;  }  }  try { ...  }  This allows to handle exceptions as follows:  } catch  ...  {  processException  ;   52  Other Members  Chapter 4: General Concepts  The remaining members of the standard exception classes create, copy, assign, and destroy exception objects.  Note that besides what   and code  , for any of the standard exception classes, no additional member is provided that describes the kind of exception. For example, there is no portable way to ﬁnd out the context of an exception or the faulty index of a range error. Thus, a portable evaluation of an exception could print only the message returned from what  :  try { ...  } catch  const std::exception& error  {     print implementation-deﬁned error message std::cerr << error.what   << std::endl; ...  The only other possible evaluation might be an interpretation of the exact type of the exception. For example, when a bad_alloc exception is thrown, a program might try to get more memory.  4.3.3 Passing Exceptions with Class exception_ptr  Since C++11, the C++ standard library provides the ability to store exceptions into objects of type exception_ptr to process them later or in other contexts:  include    std::exception_ptr eptr;     object to hold exceptions  or nullptr   eptr = std::current_exception  ;     save exception for later processing  void bar    {  if  eptr != nullptr  {  std::rethrow_exception eptr ;     process saved exception  }  }  }  }  }  void foo    {  try {  throw ...;  } catch  ...  {   4.3 Error and Exception Handling  53  current_exception   returns an exception_ptr object that refers to the currently handled ex- ception The value returned by current_exception   is valid as long as an exception_ptr refers to it. rethrow_exception   rethrows the stored exception so that bar   behaves as the initial ex- ception thrown in foo   would have occured inside bar  .  This feature is especially useful to pass exception between threads  see Section 18.2.1, page 964 .  4.3.4 Throwing Standard Exceptions  You can throw standard exceptions inside your own library or program. All logic error and run- time error standard exception classes that provide the what   interface have only a constructor for std::string and  since C++11  for const char*. The value passed here will become the de- scription returned by what  . For example, the class logic_error is deﬁned as follows:  namespace std {  public:  class logic_error : public exception {  explicit logic_error  const string& whatString ; explicit logic_error  const char* whatString ; ...     since C++11  Class std::system_error provides the ability to create an exception object by passing an error code, a what   string, and an optional category:  namespace std {  public:  class system_error : public runtime_error {  system_error  error_code ec, const string& what_arg ; system_error  error_code ec, const char* what_arg ; system_error  error_code ec ; system_error  int ev, const error_category& ecat,  const string& what_arg ;  system_error  int ev, const error_category& ecat,  const char* what_arg ;  };  }  ...  };  }  To provide an error_code object, make_error_code   convenience functions are provided that take only the error code value.  Class std::ios_base::failure provides constructors taking a what   string and  since C++11  an optional error_code object. Class std::future_error provides only a constructor taking a single error_code object.   54  Chapter 4: General Concepts  Thus, throwing a standard exception is pretty easy:  throw std::out_of_range  "out_of_range  somewhere, somehow " ;  throw  std::system_error  std::make_error_code std::errc::invalid_argument ,  "argument ... is not valid" ;  You can’t throw exceptions of the base class exception and any exception class that is provided for language support  bad_cast, bad_typeid, bad_exception .  4.3.5 Deriving from Standard Exception Classes  Another possibility for using the standard exception classes in your code is to deﬁne a special ex- ception class derived directly or indirectly from class exception. To do this, you must ensure that the what   mechanism or code   mechanism works, which is possible because what   is virtual. For an example, see class Stack in Section 12.1.3, page 635.  4.4 Callable Objects  At different places, the C++ standard library uses the term callable object, which means objects that somehow can be used to call some functionality:   A function, where additional args are passed to as arguments   A pointer to a member function, which is called for the object passed as the ﬁrst additional argument  must be reference or pointer  and gets the remaining arguments as member function parameters   A function object  operator    for a passed object , where additional args are passed as argu-   A lambda  see Section 3.1.10, page 28 , which strictly speaking is a kind of function object For example:  ments  void func  int x, int y ;  auto l = []  int x, int y  {  ...  };  class C { public:  };  void operator     int x, int y  const; void memfunc  int x, int y  const;   4.5 Concurrency and Multithreading  55  int main   {  C c; std::shared_ptr  sp new C ;     bind   uses callable objects to bind arguments: std::bind func,77,33   ; std::bind l,77,33   ; std::bind C  ,77,33   ; std::bind &C::memfunc,c,77,33   ; std::bind &C::memfunc,sp,77,33   ;     calls: func 77,33     calls: l 77,33    calls: C::operator   77,33     calls: c.memfunc 77,33     calls: sp->memfunc 77,33      async   uses callable objects to start  background  tasks: std::async func,42,77 ; std::async l,42,77 ; std::async c,42,77 ; std::async &C::memfunc,&c,42,77 ; std::async &C::memfunc,sp,42,77 ;     calls: func 42,77     calls: l 42,77     calls: c.operator   42,77     calls: c.memfunc 42,77     calls: sp->memfunc 42,77   }  page 133 .  As you can see, even smart pointers  see Section 5.2, page 76  can be used to pass an object a member function is called for. See Section 10.2.2, page 487, for details about std::bind   and Section 18.1, page 946, for details about std::async  .  To declare callable objects, in general class std::function  can be used  see Section 5.4.4,  4.5 Concurrency and Multithreading  The following apply in the core language, for example:  Before C++11, there was no support for concurrency in the language and the C++ standard library, although implementations were free to give some guarantees. With C++11, this has changed. Both the core language and the library got improvements to support concurrent programming.   We now have a memory model, which guarantees that updates on two different objects used by two different threads are independent of each other. Before C++11, there was no guarantee that writing a char in one thread could not interfere with writing another char in another thread  see section “The memory model” in [Stroustrup:C++0x] .   A new keyword, thread_local, was introduced for deﬁning thread-speciﬁc variables and ob-  jects.  In the library, we got the following:   Some guarantees regarding thread safety   Supporting classes and functions for concurrency  starting and synchronizing multiple threads    56  Chapter 4: General Concepts  The supporting classes and functions are discussed in Chapter 18. The guarantees are discussed throughout the book. However, I want to give an overview of the general guarantees here.  The General Concurrency Guarantees of the C++ Standard Library  The general constraints the C++ standard library provides regarding concurrency and multithreading since C++11 are as follows:   In general, sharing a library object by multiple threads — where at least one thread modiﬁes the object — might result in undeﬁned behavior. To quote the standard: “Modifying an object of a standard library type that is shared between threads risks undeﬁned behavior unless objects of that type are explicitly speciﬁed as being sharable without data races or the user supplies a locking mechanism.”   Especially during the construction of an object in one thread, using that object in another thread results in undeﬁned behavior. Similarly, destructing an object in one thread while using it in an- other thread results in undeﬁned behavior. Note that this applies even to objects that are provided for thread synchronization.  The most important places where concurrent access to library objects is supported are as follows:   For STL containers  see Chapter 7  and container adapters  see Chapter 12 , the following guar-  antees are given: – Concurrent read-only access is possible. This explicitly implies calling the nonconstant mem- ber functions begin  , end  , rbegin  , rend  , front  , back  , data  , find  , lower_bound  , upper_bound  , equal_range  , at  , and except for associative con- tainers, operator [ ] as well as access by iterators, if they do not modify the containers.  – Concurrent access to different elements of the same container is possible  except for class vector  . Thus, different threads might concurrently read and or write different ele- ments of the same container. For example, each thread might process something and store the result in “its” element of a shared vector.   For formatted input and output to a standard stream, which is synchronized with C I O  see Section 15.14.1, page 845 , concurrent access is possible, although it might result in interleaved characters. This by default applies to std::cin, std::cout, std::cerr. However, for string streams, ﬁle streams, or stream buffers, concurrent access results in undeﬁned behavior.   Concurrent calls of atexit   and at_quick_exit    see Section 5.8.2, page 162  are synchro- nized. The same applies to functions that set or get the new, terminate, or unexpected handler  set_new_handler  , set_unexpected  , set_terminate   and the corresponding get- ters . Also, getenv   is synchronized.   For all member functions of the default allocator  see Chapter 19  except destructors, concurrent  access is synchronized.  Note also that the library guarantees that the C++ standard library has no “hidden” side effects that break concurrent access to different objects. Thus, the C++ standard library   Does not access reachable objects other than those required for a speciﬁc operation,   Is not allowed to internally introduce shared static objects without synchronization,   Allows implementations to parallelize operations only if there are no visible side effects for the  programmer. However, see Section 18.4.2, page 983.   4.6 Allocators  4.6 Allocators  57  In several places, the C++ standard library uses special objects to handle the allocation and dealloca- tion of memory. Such objects are called allocators. They represent a special memory model and are used as an abstraction to translate the need to use memory into a raw call for memory. The use of different allocator objects at the same time allows you to use different memory models in a program. Originally, allocators were introduced as part of the STL to handle the nasty problem of different pointer types on PCs  such as near, far, and huge pointers . Now, allocators serve as a base for technical solutions that use certain memory models, such as shared memory, garbage collection, and object-oriented databases, without changing the interfaces. However, this use is relatively new and not yet widely adopted  this will probably change .  The C++ standard library deﬁnes a default allocator as follows: namespace std {  template   class allocator;  }  The default allocator is used as the default value everywhere an allocator can be used as an argu- ment. It does the usual calls for memory allocation and deallocation; that is, it calls the new and delete operators. However, when or how often these operators are called is unspeciﬁed. Thus, an implementation of the default allocator might, for example, cache the allocated memory internally. The default allocator is used in most programs. However, other libraries sometimes provide allo- cators to ﬁt certain needs. In such cases, you must simply pass them as arguments. Only occasionally does it make sense to program allocators. In practice, the default allocator is typically used. The discussion of allocators is deferred until Chapter 19, which covers in detail not only allocators but also their interfaces.   This page intentionally left blank    Chapter 5 Utilities  This chapter describes the general utilities of the C++ standard library. These utilities are small and simple classes, types, or functions that perform frequently needed tasks:   Class pair  and class tuple    Smart pointer classes  class shared_ptr  and class unique_ptr    Numeric limits1   Type traits and type utilities   Auxiliary functions  for example, min  , max  , and swap      Class ratio 1   Clocks and timers   Some important C functions Most, but not all, of these utilities are described in clause 20, “General Utilities,” of the C++ standard. The rest are described along with more major components of the library either because they are used primarily with that particular component or due to historical reasons. For example, some general auxiliary functions are deﬁned as part of the   header, although they are not algorithms in the sense of the STL  which is described in Chapter 6 .  Several of these utilities are also used within the C++ standard library. For example, type pair  is used whenever two values need to be treated as a single unit — for example, if a function has to return two values or when elements of containers are key value pairs — and type traits are used wherever complicated type conversions are necessary.  1 One could argue that numeric limits and class ratio  should be part of Chapter 17, which covers numerics, but these classes are used in some other parts of the library, so I decided to describe them here.   60  Chapter 5: Utilities  5.1 Pairs and Tuples  In C++98, the ﬁrst version of the C++ standard library, a simple class was provided to handle value pairs of different types without having to deﬁne a speciﬁc class. The C++98 class was used when a value pair was returned by standard functions and the container elements were key value pairs.  TR1 introduced a tuple class, which extended this concept for an arbitrary but still limited number  of elements. Implementations did portably allow tuples with up to ten elements of different types.  With C++11, the tuple class was reimplemented by using the concept of variadic templates  see Section 3.1.9, page 26 . Now, there is a standard tuple class for a heterogeneous collection of any size. In addition, class pair is still provided for two elements and can be used in combination with a two-element tuple.  However, the pair class of C++11 was also extended a lot, which to some extent demonstrates  the enhancements that C++ as a language and its library received with C++11.  5.1.1 Pairs  The class pair treats two values as a single unit. This class is used in several places within the C++ standard library. In particular, the container classes map, multimap, unordered_map, and unordered_multimap use pairs to manage their elements, which are key value pairs  see Sec- tion 7.8, page 331 . Other examples of the use of pairs are functions that return two values, such as minmax    see Section 5.5.1, page 134 .  The structure pair is deﬁned in   and provides the operations listed in Table 5.1. In principle, you can create, copy assign swap, and compare a pair . In addition, there are type deﬁnitions for first_type and second_type, representing the types of the ﬁrst and second values.  Element Access  To process the values of the pair direct access to the corresponding members is provided. In fact, the type is declared as struct instead of class so that all members are public:  namespace std {  template   struct pair {     member T1 first; T2 second; ...  };  }   5.1 Pairs and Tuples  Operation pair  p  pair  p val1,val1   pair  p rv1,rv2   pair  p piecewise_  construct, t1,t2   pair  p p2  pair  p rv   p = p2  p = rv  p.first p.second  get  p  get  p  p1 == p2  p1 != p2 p1 < p2  p1 > p2 p1 <= p2 p1 >= p2  p1.swap p2  swap p1,p2  make_pair val1,val2   61  Effect Default constructor; creates a pair of values of types T1 and T2, initialized with their default constructors Creates a pair of values of types T1 and T2, initialized with val1 and val1 Creates a pair of values of types T1 and T2, move initialized with rv1 and rv2 Creates a pair of values of types T1 and T2, initialized by the elements of the tuples t1 and t2  Copy constructor; creates p as copy of p2 Move constructor; moves the contents of rv to p  implicit type conversions are possible  Assigns the values of p2 to p  implicit type conversions are possible since C++11  Move assigns the values of rv to p  provided since C++11; implicit type conversions are possible  Yields the ﬁrst value inside the pair  direct member access  Yields the second value inside the pair  direct member access  Equivalent to p.first  since C++11  Equivalent to p.second  since C++11  Returns whether p1 is equal to p2  equivalent to p1.first==p2.first && p1.second==p2.second  Returns whether p1 is not equal to p2  ! p1==p2   Returns whether p1 is less than p2  compares first or if equal second of both values  Returns whether p1 is greater than p2  p2<p1  Returns whether p1 is less than or equal to p2  ! p2<p1   Returns whether p1 is greater than or equal to p2  ! p1<p2   Swaps the data of p1 and p2  since C++11  Same  as global function   since C++11  Returns a pair with types and values of val1 and val2  Table5.1. Operationsof pairs  For example, to implement a generic function template that writes a value pair to a stream, you have to program:2  2 Note that this output operator does not work where ADL  argument-dependent lookup  does not work  see Section 15.11.1, page 812, for details .   62  Chapter 5: Utilities     generic output operator for pairs  limited solution  template   std::ostream& operator <<  std::ostream& strm,  const std::pair & p   return strm << "[" << p.first << "," << p.second << "]";  In addition, a tuple-like interface  see Section 5.1.2, page 68  is available since C++11. Thus, you can use tuple_size ::value to yield the number of elements and tuple_element ::type to yield the type of a speciﬁc element, and you can use get   to gain access to first or second:  typedef std::pair  IntFloatPair; IntFloatPair p 42,3.14 ;  std::get  p  std::get  p  std::tuple_size ::value std::tuple_element ::type     yields p.first    yields p.second    yields 2    yields int  Constructors and Assignment Operators  The default constructor creates a value pair with values that are initialized by the default constructor of their type. Because of language rules, an explicit call of a default constructor also initializes fundamental data types, such as int. Thus, the declaration  std::pair  p;     initialize p.first and p.second with zero  initializes the values of p by using int   and float  , which yield zero in both cases. See Sec- tion 3.2.1, page 37, for a description of the rules for explicit initialization for fundamental types.  The copy constructor is provided with both versions for a pair of the same types and as member template, which is used when implicit type conversions are necessary. If the types match, the normal implicitly generated copy constructor is called.3 For example:  void f std::pair  ; void g std::pair  ; ... void foo   {  std::pair  p 42,"hello" ; f p ; g p ;     OK: calls implicitly generated copy constructor    OK: calls template constructor  {  }  }  3 A template constructor does not hide the implicitly generated copy constructor. See Section 3.2, page 36, for more details about this topic.   5.1 Pairs and Tuples  63  Since C++11, a pair  using a type that has only a nonconstant copy constructor will no longer compile:4  class A {  public:  ... A A& ; ...  };     copy constructor with nonconstant reference  std::pair  p;     Error since C++11  Since C++11, the assignment operator is also provided as a member template so that implicit type conversions are possible. In addition, move semantics — moving the ﬁrst and second elements — are supported.  Piecewise Construction  Class pair  provides three constructors to initialize the first and second members with initial values:  namespace std {  template   struct pair {  ... pair const T1& x, const T2& y ; template  pair U&& x, V&& y ; template    pair piecewise_construct_t,  tuple  first_args, tuple  second_args ;  ...  };  }  The ﬁrst two of these constructors provide the usual behavior: passing one argument for first and one for second, including support of move semantics and implicit type conversions. However, the third constructor is something special. It allows passing two tuples — objects of a variable number of elements of different types  see Section 5.1.2, page 68  — but processes them in a different way. Normally, by passing one or two tuples, the ﬁrst two constructors would allow initializing a pair, where first and or second are tuples. But the third constructor uses the tuples to pass their elements to the constructors of first and second. To force this behavior, you have to pass std::piecewise_construct as an additional ﬁrst argument. For example:  4 Thanks to Daniel Krugler for pointing this out.  ¨   64  Chapter 5: Utilities     util pair1.cpp  include   include   include   using namespace std;  class Foo {  public:  }  };  int main   {  Foo  tuple   {  cout << "Foo::Foo tuple " << endl;  } template   Foo  Args... args  {  cout << "Foo::Foo args... " << endl;     create tuple t: tuple  t 1,2.22 ;     pass the tuple as a whole to the constructor of Foo: pair  p1  42, t ;     pass the elements of the tuple to the constructor of Foo: pair  p2  piecewise_construct, make_tuple 42 , t ;  }  The program has the following output:  Foo::Foo tuple  Foo::Foo args...   Only where std::piecewise_construct is passed as the ﬁrst argument is class Foo forced to use a constructor that takes the elements of the tuple  an int and a float  rather than a tuple as a whole. This means that in this example, the varargs constructor of Foo is called. If provided, a constructor Foo::Foo int,float  would be called.  As you can see, both arguments have to be a tuple to force this behavior. Therefore, the ﬁrst argument, 42, is explicitly converted into a tuple, using make_tuple    you could instead pass std::tuple 42  .  Note that this form of initialization is required to emplace   a new element into an  unordered   map or multimap  see Section 7.8.2, page 341, and Section 7.9.3, page 373 .   5.1 Pairs and Tuples  65  The make_pair   function template enables you to create a value pair without writing the types explicitly.5 For example, instead of  Convenience Function make_pair    std::pair  42,’@’   you can write the following:  std::make_pair 42,’@’   Before C++11, the function was simply declared and deﬁned as follows:  namespace std {     create value pair only by providing the values template   pair  make_pair  const T1& x, const T2& y  {  return pair  x,y ;  }  }  }  }  However, since C++11, things have become more complicated because this class also deals with move semantics in a useful way. So, since C++11, the C++ standard library states that make_pair   is declared as:  namespace std {     create value pair only by providing the values template   pair  make_pair  T1&& x, T2&& y ;  where the details of the returned values and their types V1 and V2 depend on the types of x and y. Without going into details, the standard now speciﬁes that make_pair   uses move semantics if possible and copy semantics otherwise. In addition, it “decays” the arguments so that the expression make_pair "a","xy"  yields a pair  instead of a pair<const char[2],const char[3]>  see Section 5.4.2, page 132 .  The make_pair   function makes it convenient to pass two values of a pair directly to a function  that requires a pair as its argument. Consider the following example:  void f std::pair  ; void g std::pair  ; ... void foo   {  f std::make_pair 42,"empty"  ; g std::make_pair 42,"chair"  ;     pass two values as pair    pass two values as pair with type conversions  5 Using make_pair   should cost no runtime. The compiler should always optimize any implied overhead.   66  Chapter 5: Utilities  As the example shows, make_pair   works even when the types do not match exactly, because the template constructor provides implicit type conversion. When you program by using maps or multimaps, you often need this ability  see Section 7.8.2, page 341 . Note that since C++11, you can, alternatively, use initializer lists: f {42,"empty"} ; g {42,"chair"} ;     pass two values as pair    pass two values as pair with type conversions  However, an expression that has the explicit type description has an advantage because the resulting type of the pair is not derived from the values. For example, the expression  std::pair  42,7.77   does not yield the same as  std::make_pair 42,7.77   The latter creates a pair that has double as the type for the second value  unqualiﬁed ﬂoating literals have type double . The exact type may be important when overloaded functions or templates are used. These functions or templates might, for example, provide versions for both float and double to improve efﬁciency.  With the new semantic of C++11, you can inﬂuence the type make_pair   yields by forcing either move or reference semantics. For move semantics, you simply use std::move   to declare that the passed argument is no longer used:  std::string s, t; ... auto p = std::make_pair std::move s ,std::move t  ; ...     s and t are no longer used  To force reference semantics, you have to use ref  , which forces a reference type, or cref  , which forces a constant reference type  both provided by  ; see Section 5.4.3, page 132 . For example, in the following statements, a pair refers to an int twice so that, ﬁnally, i has the value 2:  include   include   include    int i = 0; auto p = std::make_pair std::ref i ,std::ref i  ; ++p.first; ++p.second; std::cout << "i: " << i << std::endl;     creates pair     increments i    increments i again    prints i: 2  Since C++11, you can also use the tie   interface, deﬁned in  , to extract values out of a pair:   5.1 Pairs and Tuples  67  include   include   include    std::pair  p=std::make_pair ’x’,’y’ ;     pair of two chars  char c; std::tie std::ignore,c  = p;     extract second value into c  ignore ﬁrst one   In fact, here the pair p is assigned to a tuple, where the second value is a reference to c  see Sec- tion 5.1.2, page 70, for details .  Pair Comparisons  namespace std {  For the comparison of two pairs, the C++ standard library provides the usual comparison operators. Two value pairs are equal if both values are equal:  template   bool operator==  const pair & x, const pair & y  {  return x.first == y.first && x.second == y.second;  }  }  }  }  In a comparison of pairs, the ﬁrst value has higher priority. Thus, if the ﬁrst values of two pairs differ, the result of their comparison is used as the result of the overall comparison of the pairs. If the members first are equal, the comparison of the members second yields the overall result:  namespace std {  template   bool operator & x, const pair & y  {  return x.first < y.first    ! y.first < x.first  && x.second < y.second ;  The other comparison operators are deﬁned accordingly.  Examples of Pair Usage  The C++ standard library uses pairs a lot. For example, the  unordered  map and multimap containers use pair as a type to manage their elements, which are key value pairs. See Section 7.8, page 331, for a general description of maps and multimaps, and in particular Section 6.2.2, page 179, for an example that shows the usage of type pair.  Objects of type pair are also used inside the C++ standard library in functions that return two  values  see Section 7.7.2, page 323, for an example .   68  5.1.2 Tuples  Chapter 5: Utilities  Tuples were introduced in TR1 to extend the concept of pairs to an arbitrary number of elements. That is, tuples represent a heterogeneous list of elements for which the types are speciﬁed or deduced at compile time.  However, with TR1 using the language features of C++98, it was not possible to deﬁne a template for a variable number of elements. For this reason, implementations had to specify all possible numbers of elements a tuple could have. The recommendation in TR1 was to support at least ten arguments, which meant that tuples were usually deﬁned as follows, although some implementations did provide more template parameters:  template <typename T0 = ..., typename T1 = ..., typename T2 = ..., typename T3 = ..., typename T4 = ..., typename T5 = ..., typename T6 = ..., typename T7 = ..., typename T8 = ..., typename T9 = ...>  class tuple;  That is, class tuple has at least ten template parameters of different types, with an implementation- speciﬁc default value used to give unused tuple elements a default type with no abilities. This was in fact an emulation of variadic templates, which in practice, however, was quite cumbersome and very limited.  With C++11, variadic templates were introduced to enable templates to accept an arbitrary num- ber of template arguments  see Section 3.1.9, page 26 . As a consequence, the declaration for class tuple, which happens in  , is now reduced to the following:  namespace std {  template   class tuple;  }  Tuple Operations     util tuple1.cpp  include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  In principle, the tuple interface is very straightforward:   You can create a tuple by declaring it either explicitly or implicitly with the convenience function   You can access elements with the get    function template. Here is a basic example of this interface:  make_tuple  .   5.1 Pairs and Tuples  int main   {     create a four-element tuple    - elements are initialized with default value  0 for fundamental types  tuple > t;     create and initialize a tuple explicitly tuple  t1 41,6.3,"nico" ;  69     ‘‘iterate’’ over elements: cout   t1  << " "; cout   t1  << " "; cout   t1  << " "; cout << endl;     create tuple with make_tuple      - auto declares t2 with type of right-hand side    - thus, type of t2 is tuple auto t2 = make_tuple 22,44,"nico" ;     assign second value in t2 to t1 get  t1  = get  t2 ;     comparison and assignment    - including type conversion from tuple     if  t1 < t2  {  to tuple      compares value for value    OK, assigns value for value  t1 = t2;  }  }  The following statement creates a heterogeneous four-element tuple:  tuple > t;  The values are initialized with their default constructors. Fundamental types are initialized with 0  this guarantee applies only since C++11 .  The statement tuple  t1 41,6.3,"nico" ; creates and initializes a heterogeneous three-element tuple.   70  Chapter 5: Utilities  Alternatively, you can use make_tuple   to create a tuple in which the types are automatically derived from the initial values. For example, you can use the following to create and initialize a tuple of the corresponding types int, int, and const char*.6  make_tuple 22,44,"nico"   Note that a tuple type can be a reference. For example:  string s; tuple  t s ;     ﬁrst element of tuple t refers to s  get  t  = "hello";     assigns "hello" to s  A tuple is no ordinary container class where you can iterate over the elements. Instead, for element access, member templates are provided so that you have to know the index of elements you want to access at compile time. For example, you get access to the ﬁrst element of tuple t1 as follows:  Passing an index at runtime is not possible:  get  t1   int i; get  t1      compile-time error: i is no compile-time value  The good news is that it is also a compile-time error to pass an invalid index:  get  t1      compile-time error if t1 has only three elements  In addition, tuples provide the usual copy, assignment, and comparison operations. For all of them, implicit type conversions are possible  because member templates are used , but the number of elements must match. Tuples are equal if all elements are equal. To check whether a container is less than another container, a lexicographical comparison is done  see Section 11.5.4, page 548 .  Table 5.2 lists all operations provided for tuples.  Convenience Functions make_tuple   and tie    The convenience function make_tuple   creates a tuple of values without explicitly specifying their types. For example, the expression  make_tuple 22,44,"nico"   creates and initializes a tuple of the corresponding types int, int, and const char*.  By using the special reference_wrapper  function object and its convenience functions ref   and cref    all available since C++11 in  ; see Section 5.4.3, page 132  you can inﬂuence the type that make_tuple   yields. For example, the following expression yields a tuple with a reference to variable object x:  string s; make_tuple ref s       yields type tuple , where the element refers to s  6 The type of "nico" is const char[5], but it decays to const char* using the type trait std::decay    see Section 5.4.2, page 132 .   5.1 Pairs and Tuples  71  Operation tuple  t Creates a tuple with n elements of the speciﬁed types, initialized  Effect  tuple   t v1,v2,...,vn   tuple  t p   t = t2 t = p  t1 == t2  t1 != t2 t1 < t2  t1 > t2 t1 <= t2 t1 >= t2 t1.swap t2  swap t1,t2  make_tuple v1,v2,...   tie ref1,ref2,...   with their default constructors  0 for fundamental types  Creates a tuple with n elements of the speciﬁed types, initialized with the speciﬁed values Creates a tuple with two elements of the speciﬁed type, initialized with the values of the passed pair p  ps types must match  Assigns the values of t2 to t Assigns a pair p to a tuple with two elements  the types of the pair p must match  Returns whether t1 is equal to t2  true if a comparison with == of all elements yields true  Returns whether t1 is not equal to t2  ! t1==t2   Returns whether t1 is less than TIt2  uses lexicographical comparison  Returns whether t1 is greater than t2  t2<t1  Returns whether t1 is less than or equal to t2  ! t2<t1   Returns whether t1 is greater than or equal to t2  ! t1<t2   Swaps the data of t1 and t2  since C++11  Same  as global function   since C++11  Creates a tuple with types and values of all passed values, and allows extracting values out of a tuple Creates a tuple of references, which allows extracting  individual  values out of a tuple  Table5.2. Operationsoftuples  This can be important if you want to modify an existing value via a tuple:  std::string s;  auto x = std::make_tuple s ; std::get  x  = "my value";     x is of type tuple     modiﬁes x but not s  auto y = std::make_tuple ref s  ; std::get  y  = "my value";     y is of type tuple , thus y refers to s    modiﬁes y  By using references with make_tuple  , you can extract values of a tuple back to some other variables. Consider the following example:  std::tuple   t 77,1.1,"more light" ; int i; float f; std::string s;    assign values of t to i, f, and s: std::make_tuple std::ref i ,std::ref f ,std::ref s   = t;   72  Chapter 5: Utilities  To make the use of references in tuples even more convenient, the use of tie   creates a tuple of references:  std::tuple   t 77,1.1,"more light" ; int i; float f; std::string s; std::tie i,f,s  = t;     assigns values of t to i, f, and s  Here, std::tie i,f,s  creates a tuple with references to i, f, and s, so the assignment of t assigns the elements in t to i, f, and s.  The use of std::ignore allows ignoring tuple elements while parsing with tie  . This can be  used to extract tuple values partially:  std::tuple   t 77,1.1,"more light" ; int i; std::string s; std::tie i,std::ignore,s  = t;     assigns ﬁrst and third value of t to i and s  The constructor taking a variable number of arguments to initialize a tuple is declared as explicit:  Tuples and Initializer Lists  namespace std {  template   class tuple {  public:  explicit tuple const Types&... ; template   explicit tuple UTypes&&... ; ...  };  }  The reason is to avoid having single values implicitly converted into a tuple with one element:  template   void foo  const std::tuple  t ;  foo 42 ; foo make_tuple 42  ;     ERROR: explicit conversion to tuple  required    OK  This situation, however, has consequences when using initializer lists to deﬁne values of a tuple. For example, you can’t use the assignment syntax to initialize a tuple because that is considered to be an implicit conversion:  std::tuple  t1 42,3.14 ; std::tuple  t2{42,3.14}; std::tuple  t3 = {42,3.14};     OK, old syntax    OK, new syntax    ERROR   5.1 Pairs and Tuples  73  In addition, you can’t pass an initializer list where a tuple is expected:  std::vector > v { {1,1.0}, {2,2.0} };     ERROR  std::tuple  foo   {  return { 1, 2, 3 };     ERROR  Note that it works for pair s and containers  except array s :  std::vector > v1 { {1,1.0}, {2,2.0} }; v2 { {1,1.0}, {2,2.0} }; std::vector >     OK    OK  std::vector  foo2   {  return { 1, 2, 3 };     OK  But for tuples, you have to explicitly convert the initial values into a tuple  for example, by using make_tuple   :  std::vector > v { std::make_tuple 1,1.0 ,  std::make_tuple 2,2.0  };     OK  std::tuple  foo   {  return std::make_tuple 1,2,3 ;     OK  }  }  }  Additional Tuple Features  For tuples, some additional helpers are declared, especially to support generic programming:   tuple_size ::value yields the number of elements.   tuple_element ::type yields the type of the element with index idx  this   tuple_cat   concatenates multiple tuples into one tuple. The use of tuple_size  and tuple_element  shows the following example:  is the type get   returns .  typename std::tuple  TupleType;  std::tuple_size ::value std::tuple_element ::type     yields 3    yields float  You can use tuple_cat   to concatenate all forms of tuples, including pair s:  int n; auto tt = std::tuple_cat  std::make_tuple 42,7.7,"hello" ,  std::tie n  ;  Here, tt becomes a tuple with all elements of the passed tuples, including the fact that the last element is a reference to n.   74  Chapter 5: Utilities  The tuple class was ﬁrst made public in the Boost library  see [Boost] . There, tuple had an interface to write values to output streams, but there is no support for this in the C++ standard library. With the following header ﬁle, you can print any tuple with the standard output operator <<:7  5.1.3 I O for Tuples     util printtuple.hpp  include   include       helper: print element with index IDX of tuple with MAX elements template   struct PRINT_TUPLE {  static void print  std::ostream& strm, const std::tuple & t  {  strm   t  <<  IDX+1==MAX ? "" : "," ; PRINT_TUPLE ::print strm,t ;     partial specialization to end the recursion template   struct PRINT_TUPLE  {  static void print  std::ostream& strm, const std::tuple & t  { }     output operator for tuples template   std::ostream& operator <<  std::ostream& strm,  const std::tuple & t   strm << "["; PRINT_TUPLE ::print strm,t ; return strm << "]";  }  };  };  {  }  This code makes heavy use of template metaprogramming to recursively iterate at compile time over the elements of a tuple. Each call of PRINT_TUPLE ::print   prints one element and calls the  7 Note that this output operator does not work where ADL  argument-dependent lookup  does not work  see Section 15.11.1, page 812, for details .   5.1 Pairs and Tuples  75  same function for the next element. A partial specialization, where the current index IDX and the number of elements in the tuple MAX are equal, ends this recursion. For example, the program     util tuple2.cpp  include "printtuple.hpp" include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {  }  has the following output:  io: [77,1.1,more light]  Here, the output expression  cout << t  calls  tuple   t 77,1.1,"more light" ; cout << "io: " << t << endl;  PRINT_TUPLE ::print cout,t ;  5.1.4 Conversions between tuples and pairs  As listed in Table 5.2 on page 71, you can initialize a two-element tuple with a pair. Also, you can assign a pair to a two-element tuple.  Note that pair  provides a special constructor to use tuples to initialize its elements. See Section 5.1.1, page 63, for details. Note also that other types might provide a tuple-like interface. In fact, class pair   see Section 5.1.1, page 62  and class array   see Section 7.2.5, page 268  do.   76  Chapter 5: Utilities  5.2 Smart Pointers  Since C, we know that pointers are important but are a source of trouble. One reason to use pointers is to have reference semantics outside the usual boundaries of scope. However, it can be very tricky to ensure that their lifetime and the lifetime of the objects they refer to match, especially when multiple pointers refer to the same object. For example, to have the same object in multiple collections  see Chapter 7 , you have to pass a pointer into each collection, and ideally there should be no problems when one of the pointers gets destroyed  no “dangling pointers” or multiple deletions of the referenced object  and when the last reference to an object gets destroyed  no “resource leaks” . A usual approach to avoid these kinds of problems is to use “smart pointers.” They are “smart” in the sense that they support programmers in avoiding problems such as those just described. For example, a smart pointer can be so smart that it “knows” whether it is the last pointer to an object and uses this knowledge to delete an associated object only when it, as “last owner” of an object, gets destroyed.  Note, however, that it is not sufﬁcient to provide only one smart pointer class. Smart pointers can be smart about different aspects and might fulﬁll different priorities, because you might pay a price for the smartness. Note that with a speciﬁc smart pointer, it’s still possible to misuse a pointer or to program erroneous behavior.  Since C++11, the C++ standard library provides two types of smart pointer:  1. Class shared_ptr for a pointer that implements the concept of shared ownership. Multiple smart pointers can refer to the same object so that the object and its associated resources get re- leased whenever the last reference to it gets destroyed. To perform this task in more complicated scenarios, helper classes, such as weak_ptr, bad_weak_ptr, and enable_shared_from_this, are provided.  2. Class unique_ptr for a pointer that implements the concept of exclusive ownership or strict ownership. This pointer ensures that only one smart pointer can refer to this object at a time. However, you can transfer ownership. This pointer is especially useful for avoiding resource leaks, such as missing calls of delete after or while an object gets created with new and an exception occurred.  Historically, C++98 had only one smart pointer class provided by the C++ standard library, class auto_ptr , which was designed to perform the task that unique_ptr now provides. However, due to missing language features, such as move semantics for constructors and assignment operators and other ﬂaws, this class turned out to be difﬁcult to understand and error prone. So, after class shared_ptr was introduced with TR1 and class unique_ptr was introduced with C++11, class auto_ptr ofﬁcially became deprecated with C++11, which means that you should not use it unless you have old existing code to compile.  All smart pointer classes are deﬁned in the   header ﬁle.  5.2.1 Class shared_ptr  Almost every nontrivial program needs the ability to use or deal with objects at multiple places at the same time. Thus, you have to “refer” to an object from multiple places in your program. Although the language provides references and pointers, this is not enough, because you often have to ensure   5.2 Smart Pointers  77  that when the last reference to an object gets deleted, the object itself gets deleted, which might require some cleanup operations, such as freeing memory or releasing a resource.  So we need a semantics of “cleanup when the object is nowhere used anymore.” Class shared_ptr provides this semantics of shared ownership. Thus, multiple shared_ptrs are able to share, or “own,” the same object. The last owner of the object is responsible for destroying it and cleaning up all resources associated with it.  By default, the cleanup is a call of delete, assuming that the object was created with new. But you can  and often must  deﬁne other ways to clean up objects. You can deﬁne your own destruction policy. For example, if your object is an array allocated with new[], you have to deﬁne that the cleanup performs a delete[]. Other examples are the deletion of associated resources, such as handles, locks, associated temporary ﬁles, and so on.  To summarize, the goal of shared_ptrs is to automatically release resources associated with  objects when those objects are no longer needed  but not before .  Using Class shared_ptr  You can use a shared_ptr just as you would any other pointer. Thus, you can assign, copy, and compare shared pointers, as well as use operators * and ->, to access the object the pointer refers to. Consider the following example:     util sharedptr1.cpp  include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {     two shared pointers representing two persons by their name shared_ptr  pNico new string "nico"  ; shared_ptr  pJutta new string "jutta"  ;     capitalize person names  *pNico [0] = ’N’; pJutta->replace 0,1,"J" ;     put them multiple times in a container vector > whoMadeCoffee; whoMadeCoffee.push_back pJutta ; whoMadeCoffee.push_back pJutta ; whoMadeCoffee.push_back pNico ; whoMadeCoffee.push_back pJutta ; whoMadeCoffee.push_back pNico ;   78  Chapter 5: Utilities     print all elements for  auto ptr : whoMadeCoffee  {  cout << *ptr << "  ";  } cout << endl;     overwrite a name again *pNico = "Nicolai";     print all elements again for  auto ptr : whoMadeCoffee  {  cout << *ptr << "  ";  } cout << endl;     print some internal data cout << "use_count: " << whoMadeCoffee[0].use_count   << endl;  }  After including  , where shared_ptr class is deﬁned, two shared_ptrs representing pointers to strings are declared and initialized:  shared_ptr  pNico new string "nico"  ; shared_ptr  pJutta new string "jutta"  ;  Note that because the constructor taking a pointer as single argument is explicit, you can’t use the assignment notation here because that is considered to be an implicit conversion. However, the new initialization syntax is also possible:  shared_ptr  pNico = new string "nico" ; shared_ptr  pNico{new string "nico" };     ERROR    OK  You can also use the convenience function make_shared   here:  shared_ptr  pNico = make_shared  "nico" ; shared_ptr  pJutta = make_shared  "jutta" ;  This way of creation is faster and safer because it uses one instead of two allocations: one for the object and one for the shared data the shared pointer uses to control the object  see Section 5.2.4, page 95, for details .  Alternatively, you can declare the shared pointer ﬁrst and assign a new pointer later on. However,  you can’t use the assignment operator; you have to use reset   instead:  shared_ptr  pNico4; pNico4 = new string "nico" ; pNico4.reset new string "nico"  ;     OK     ERROR: no assignment for ordinary pointers   5.2 Smart Pointers  79  The following two lines demonstrate that using shared pointers is just like using ordinary pointers:   *pNico [0] = ’N’; pJutta->replace 0,1,"J" ;  With operator *, you yield the object pNico refers to to assign a capital ’N’ to its ﬁrst character. With operator ->, you get access to a member of the object pJutta refers to. Thus, here the member function replace   allows you to replace substrings  see Section 13.3.7, page 706 .  pNico:   pJutta:   pNico:   pJutta:   “Nico”   “Jutta”   “Nicolai”   “Jutta”   whoMadeCoffee:   whoMadeCoffee:   Figure5.1. Using shared_ptrs  Next we insert both pointers multiple times into a container of type vector   see Section 7.3, page 270 . The container usually creates its own copy of the elements passed, so we would insert copies of strings if we inserted the strings directly. However, because we pass pointers to the strings, these pointers are copied, so the container now contains multiple references to the same object. This means that if we modify the objects, all occurrences of this object in the container get modiﬁed. Thus, after replacing the value of the string pNico  *pNico = "Nicolai";  all occurrences of this object now refer to the new value, as you can see in Figure 5.1 and according to the corresponding output of the program: Nico  Jutta  Jutta Jutta Jutta Jutta use_count: 4  Nico Nicolai  Jutta  Nicolai  The last row of the output is the result of calling use_count   for the ﬁrst shared pointer in the vector. use_count   yields the current number of owners an object referred to by shared pointers has. As you can see, we have four owners of the object referred to by the ﬁrst element in the vector: pJutta and the three copies of it inserted into the container.  At the end of the program, when the last owner of a string gets destroyed, the shared pointer calls delete for the object it refers to. Such a deletion does not necessarily have to happen at the end of the scope. For example, assigning the nullptr  see Section 3.1.1, page 14  to pNico or resizing the vector so that it contains only the ﬁrst two elements would delete the last owner of the string initialized with nico.   80  Deﬁning a Deleter  Chapter 5: Utilities  We can declare our own deleter, which, for example, prints a message before it deletes the referenced object:  shared_ptr  pNico new string "nico" ,  [] string* p  {  cout << "delete " << *p << endl; delete p;  } ;  ...    pNico does not refer to the string any longer pNico = nullptr; whoMadeCoffee.resize 2 ;    all copies of the string in pNico are destroyed  Here, we pass a lambda  see Section 3.1.10, page 28  as the second argument to the constructor of a shared_ptr. Having pNico declared that way, the lambda function gets called when the last owner of a string gets destroyed. So the preceding program with this modiﬁcation would print  delete Nicolai  when resize   gets called after all statements as discussed before. The effect would be the same if we ﬁrst changed the size of the vector and then assigned nullptr or another object to pNico.  For another example application of shared_ptr , see how elements can be shared by two  containers in Section 7.11, page 388.  Dealing with Arrays  Note that the default deleter provided by shared_ptr calls delete, not delete[]. This means that the default deleter is appropriate only if a shared pointer owns a single object created with new. Unfortunately, creating a shared_ptr for an array is possible but wrong:  std::shared_ptr  p new int[10] ;     ERROR, but compiles  So, if you use new[] to create an array of objects you have to deﬁne your own deleter. You can do that by passing a function, function object, or lambda, which calls delete[ ] for the passed ordinary pointer. For example:  std::shared_ptr  p new int[10], [] int* p  {  delete[] p;  } ;  You can also use a helper ofﬁcially provided for unique_ptr, which calls delete[] as deleter  see Section 5.2.5, page 106 :  std::shared_ptr  p new int[10],  std::default_delete    ;  Note, however, that shared_ptr and unique_ptr deal with deleters in slightly different ways. For example, unique_ptrs provide the ability to own an array simply by passing the corresponding element type as template argument, whereas for shared_ptrs this is not possible:   5.2 Smart Pointers  81  std::unique_ptr  p new int[10] ; std::shared_ptr  p new int[10] ;     OK    ERROR: does not compile  In addition, for unique_ptrs, you have to specify a second template argument to specify your own deleter:  std::unique_ptr  p new int[10], [] int* p  {  delete[] p;  } ;  Note also that shared_ptr does not provide an operator [ ]. For unique_ptr, a partial special- ization for arrays exists, which provides operator [ ] instead of operators * and ->. The reason for this difference is that unique_ptr is optimized for performance and ﬂexibility. See Section 5.2.8, page 114, for details.  Dealing with Other Destruction Policies  When the cleanup after the last owning shared pointer is something other than deleting memory, you have to specify your own deleter. You can understand this to specify your own destruction policy.  As a ﬁrst example, suppose that we want to ensure that a temporary ﬁle gets removed when the  last reference to it gets destroyed. This is how it could be done:     for ofstream    for shared_ptr    for remove       util sharedptr2.cpp  include   include   include   include    class FileDeleter {  private:  public:  std::string filename;  FileDeleter  const std::string& fn   : filename fn  {  } void operator     std::ofstream* fp  {     close.ﬁle fp->close  ; std::remove filename.c_str   ;    delete ﬁle  }  };  int main   {     create and open temporary ﬁle:   std::shared_ptr  fp new std::ofstream "tmpfile.txt" ,  FileDeleter "tmpfile.txt"  ;  Chapter 5: Utilities  82  ...  }  Here, we initialize a shared_ptr with a newly created output ﬁle  see Section 15.9, page 791 . The passed FileDeleter ensures that this ﬁles gets closed and deleted with the standard C function remove  , provided in   when the last copy of this shared pointer loses the ownership of this output stream. Because remove   needs the ﬁlename, we pass this as an argument to the constructor of FileDeleter.  Our second example demonstrates how to use shared_ptrs to deal with shared memory:8     util sharedptr3.cpp     for shared_ptr  include   include      for shared memory include   include   include   include   include   include       for strerror      for errno  class SharedMemoryDetacher {  public:  void operator     int* p  {  std::cout << "unlink  tmp1234" << std::endl; if  shm_unlink " tmp1234"  != 0  {  std::cerr << "OOPS: shm_unlink   failed" << std::endl;  }  }  };  std::shared_ptr  getSharedIntMemory  int num  {  void* mem; int shmfd = shm_open " tmp1234", O_CREATO_RDWR, S_IRWXUS_IRWXG ; if  shmfd < 0  {  throw std::string strerror errno  ;  }  8 There are multiple system-dependent ways to deal with shared memory. Here, the standard POSIX way with shm_open   and mmap   is used, which requires shm_unlink   to be called to release the  persistent  shared memory.   5.2 Smart Pointers  83  if  ftruncate shmfd, num*sizeof int   == -1  {  throw std::string strerror errno  ;  } mem = mmap nullptr, num*sizeof int , PROT_READ  PROT_WRITE,  MAP_SHARED, shmfd, 0 ;  if  mem == MAP_FAILED  {  throw std::string strerror errno  ;  } return std::shared_ptr  static_cast  mem ,  SharedMemoryDetacher   ;  }  int main   {     get and attach shared memory for 100 ints: std::shared_ptr  smp getSharedIntMemory 100  ;     init the shared memory for  int i=0; i<100; ++i  {  smp.get  [i] = i*42;  }     deal with shared memory somewhere else: ... std::cout  " << std::endl; std::cin.get  ;     release shared memory here: smp.reset  ; ...  }  First, a deleter SharedMemoryDetacher is deﬁned to detach shared memory. The deleter releases the shared memory, which getSharedIntMemory   gets and attaches. To ensure that the deleter is called when the last use of the shared memory is over, it is passed when getSharedIntMemory   creates a shared_ptr for the attached memory:  return std::shared_ptr  static_cast  mem ,  SharedMemoryDetacher   ;     calls shmdt    Alternatively, you could use a lambda here  skipping preﬁx std:: :  return shared_ptr  static_cast  mem ,  [] int* p  {  cout << "unlink  tmp1234" << endl;   84  Chapter 5: Utilities  if  shm_unlink " tmp1234"  != 0  {  cerr << "OOPS: shm_unlink   failed"  << endl;  }  } ;  Note that the passed deleter is not allowed to throw exceptions. Therefore, we only write an error message to std::cerr here.  Because the signature of shm_unlink   already ﬁts, you could even use shm_unlink   directly  as deleter if you don’t want to check its return value:  return std::shared_ptr  static_cast  mem ,  shm_unlink ;  Note that shared_ptrs provide only operators * and ->. Pointer arithmetic and operator [ ] are not provided. Thus, to access the memory, you have to use get  , which yields the internal pointer wrapped by shared_ptr to provide the full pointer semantics:  smp.get  [i] = i*42;  Thus, get   provides an alternative of calling:   &*smp [i] = i*42;  For both examples, another possible implementation technique is probably cleaner than this: Just create a new class, where the constructor does the initial stuff and the destructor does the cleanup. You can then just use shared_ptrs to manage objects of this class created with new. The beneﬁt is that you can deﬁne a more intuitive interface, such as an operator [ ] for an object representing shared memory. However, you should then carefully think about copy and assignment operations; if in doubt, disable them.  5.2.2 Class weak_ptr  However, under certain circumstances, this behavior doesn’t work or is not what is intended:  The major reason to use shared_ptrs is to avoid taking care of the resources a pointer refers to. As written, shared_ptrs are provided to automatically release resources associated with objects no longer needed.   One example is cyclic references. If two objects refer to each other using shared_ptrs, and you want to release the objects and their associated resource if no other references to these objects exist, shared_ptr won’t release the data, because the use_count   of each object is still 1. You might want to use ordinary pointers in this situation, but doing so requires explicitly caring for and managing the release of associated resources.   Another example occurs when you explicitly want to share but not own an object. Thus, you have the semantics that the lifetime of a reference to an object outlives the object it refers to. Here, shared_ptrs would never release the object, and ordinary pointers might not notice that the object they refer to is not valid anymore, which introduces the risk of accessing released data.   5.2 Smart Pointers  85  For both cases, class weak_ptr is provided, which allows sharing but not owning an object. This class requires a shared pointer to get created. Whenever the last shared pointer owning the object loses its ownership, any weak pointer automatically becomes empty. Thus, besides default and copy constructors, class weak_ptr provides only a constructor taking a shared_ptr.  You can’t use operators * and -> to access a referenced object of a weak_ptr directly. Instead,  you have to create a shared pointer out of it. This makes sense for two reasons: 1. Creating a shared pointer out of a weak pointer checks whether there is  still  an associated object. If not, this operation will throw an exception or create an empty shared pointer  what exactly happens depends on the operation used .  2. While dealing with the referenced object, the shared pointer can’t get released. As a consequence, class weak_ptr provides only a small number of operations: Just enough to create, copy, and assign a weak pointer and convert it into a shared pointer or check whether it refers to an object.  Using Class weak_ptr  Consider the following example:     util weakptr1.cpp  include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  class Person {  public:  string name; shared_ptr  mother; shared_ptr  father; vector > kids;  Person  const string& n,  shared_ptr  m = nullptr, shared_ptr  f = nullptr   : name n , mother m , father f  {  ~Person   {  cout << "delete " << name << endl;  }  }  };   86  Chapter 5: Utilities  }  }  shared_ptr  initFamily  const string& name  {  shared_ptr  mom new Person name+"’s mom"  ; shared_ptr  dad new Person name+"’s dad"  ; shared_ptr  kid new Person name,mom,dad  ; mom->kids.push_back kid ; dad->kids.push_back kid ; return kid;  int main   {  shared_ptr  p = initFamily "nico" ;  cout << "nico’s family exists" << endl; cout << "- nico is shared " << p.use_count   << " times" << endl; cout << "- name of 1st kid of nico’s mom: "   mother->kids[0]->name << endl;  p = initFamily "jim" ; cout << "jim’s family exists" << endl;  Here, a class Person has a name and optional references to other Persons, namely, the parents  mother and father  and the kids  a vector; see Section 7.3, page 270 .  First, initFamily   creates three Persons: mom, dad, and kid, initialized with corresponding names based on the passed argument. In addition, kid is initialized with the parents, and for both parents, kid is inserted in the list of kids. Finally, initFamily   returns the kid. Figure 5.2 shows the resulting situation at the end of initFamily   and after calling and assigning the result to p.  As you can see, p is our last handle into the family created. Internally, however, each object has references from the kid to each parent and backwards. So, for example, nico was shared three times before p gets a new value. Now, if we release our last handle to the family — either by assigning a new person or nullptr to p or by leaving the scope of p at the end of main   — none of the Persons gets released, because each still has at least one shared pointer referring to it. As a result, the destructor of each Person, which would print “delete name,” never gets called:  nico’s family exists - nico shared 3 times - name of 1st kid of nicos mom: nico jim’s family exists  Using weak_ptrs instead helps here. For example, we can declare kids to be a vector of weak_ptrs:   5.2 Smart Pointers  87  mom:   dad:   kid:   name:  mother:  father:  kids:   name:  mother:  father:  kids:   “nico”   name:  mother:  father:  kids:   “nico’s mom”   “nico’s mom”   “nico’s dad”   “nico’s dad”   name:  mother:  father:  kids:   name:  mother:  father:  kids:   “nico”   name:  mother:  father:  kids:   p:   Figure5.2. AFamilyUsing shared_ptrsOnly     util weakptr2.cpp ... class Person {  public:  string name; shared_ptr  mother; shared_ptr  father; vector > kids; Person  const string& n,  shared_ptr  m = nullptr, shared_ptr  f = nullptr   : name n , mother m , father f  {     weak pointer !!!  cout << "delete " << name << endl;  } ~Person   {  }  }; ...  By doing so, we can break the cycle of shared pointers so that in one direction  from kid to parent  a shared pointer is used, whereas from a parent to the kids, weak pointers are used  the dashed line in Figure 5.3 .   88  Chapter 5: Utilities  mom:   dad:   kid:   name:  mother:  father:  kids:   name:  mother:  father:  kids:   “nico”   name:  mother:  father:  kids:   “nico’s mom”   “nico’s mom”   “nico’s dad”   “nico’s dad”   name:  mother:  father:  kids:   name:  mother:  father:  kids:   “nico”   name:  mother:  father:  kids:   p:   Figure5.3. AFamilyUsing shared_ptrsand weak_ptrs  As a result, the program now has the following output:  nico’s family exists - nico shared 1 times - name of 1st kid of nicos mom: nico delete nico delete nico’s dad delete nico’s mom jim’s family exists delete jim delete jim’s dad delete jim’s mom  As soon as we lose our handle into a family created — either by assigning a new value to p or by leaving main   — the kid’s object of the family loses its last owner  use_count   yielded 1 before , which has the effect that both parents lose their last owner. So all objects, initially created by new, are deleted now so that their destructors get called.  Note that by using weak pointers, we had to slightly modify the way we access the object referred  to via a weak pointer. Instead of calling  p->mother->kids[0]->name  we now have to insert lock   into the expression  p->mother->kids[0].lock  ->name   5.2 Smart Pointers  89  which yields a shared_ptr out of the weak_ptr the vector of kids contains. If this modiﬁcation is not possible — for example, because the last owner of the object released the object in the mean- time — lock   yields an empty shared_ptr. In that case, calling operator * or -> would cause undeﬁned behavior.  If you are not sure that the object behind a weak pointer still exists, you have several options:  1. You can call expired  , which returns true if the weak_ptr doesn’t share an object any longer.  This option is equivalent to checking whether use_count   is equal to 0 but might be faster.  2. You can explicitly convert a weak_ptr into a shared_ptr by using a corresponding shared_ptr constructor. If there is no valid referenced object, this constructor will throw a bad_weak_ptr exception. This is an exception of a class derived from std::exception, where what   yields "bad_weak_ptr".9 See Section 4.3.1, page 43, for details about all standard ex- ceptions.  3. You can call use_count   to ask for the number of owners the associated object has. If the return value is 0, there is no valid object any longer. Note, however, that you should usu- ally call use_count   only for debugging purposes; the C++ standard library explicitly states: “use_count   is not necessarily efﬁcient.”  For example:  try {  shared_ptr  sp new string "hi"  ; weak_ptr  wp = sp; sp.reset  ; cout << wp.use_count   << endl; cout << boolalpha << wp.expired   << endl;    prints: true shared_ptr  p wp ;     create shared pointer    create weak pointer out of it    release object of shared pointer    prints: 0     throws std::bad_weak_ptr  } catch  const std::exception& e  {  }  cerr << "exception: " << e.what   << endl;    prints: bad_weak_ptr  5.2.3 Misusing Shared Pointers  Although shared_ptrs improve program safety, because in general resources associated with ob- jects are automatically released, problems are possible when objects are no longer in use. One problem just discussed is “dangling pointers” caused by cyclic dependencies.  As another problem, you have to ensure that only one group of shared pointers owns an object.  The following code will not work:  9 For exceptions, the return value of what   is usually implementation speciﬁc. However, the standard speciﬁes to yield "bad_weak_ptr" here. Nevertheless, implementations might not follow this advice; for example, GCC 4.6.1 returned "std::bad_weak_ptr".   90  Chapter 5: Utilities  int* p = new int; shared_ptr  sp1 p ; shared_ptr  sp2 p ;     ERROR: two shared pointers manage allocated int  The problem is that both sp1 and sp2 would release the associated resource  call delete  when they lose their ownership of p. In general, having two owning groups means that the release of the associated resource is performed twice whenever the last owner of each group loses the ownership or gets destroyed. For this reason, you should always directly initialize a smart pointer the moment you create the object with its associated resource:  shared_ptr  sp1 new int ; shared_ptr  sp2 sp1 ;     OK  This problem might also occur indirectly. In the example just introduced, suppose that we want to introduce a member function for a Person that creates both the reference from a kid to the parent and a corresponding reference back:  shared_ptr  mom new Person name+"’s mom"  ; shared_ptr  dad new Person name+"’s dad"  ; shared_ptr  kid new Person name  ; kid->setParentsAndTheirKids mom,dad ;  Here is a naive implementation of setParentsAndTheirKids  :  class Person {  public:  ... void setParentsAndTheirKids  shared_ptr  m = nullptr,  shared_ptr  f = nullptr  {  mother = m; father = f; if  m != nullptr  {  } if  f != nullptr  {  m->kids.push_back shared_ptr  this  ;     ERROR  f->kids.push_back shared_ptr  this  ;     ERROR  }  } ...  };  The problem is the creation of a shared pointer out of this. We do that because we want to set the kids of members mother and father. But to do that, we need a shared pointer to the kid, which we don’t have at hand. However, creating a new shared pointer out of this doesn’t solve the issue, because we then open a new group of owners.  One way to deal with this problem is to pass the shared pointer to the kid as a third argument. But the C++ standard library provides another option: class std::enable_shared_from_this . You can use class std::enable_shared_from_this  to derive your class, representing ob- jects managed by shared pointers, with your class name passed as template argument. Doing so al-   5.2 Smart Pointers  91  lows you to use a derived member function shared_from_this   to create a correct shared_ptr out of this:  class Person : public std::enable_shared_from_this  {  public:  ... void setParentsAndTheirKids  shared_ptr  m = nullptr,  shared_ptr  f = nullptr  {  mother = m; father = f; if  m != nullptr  {  } if  f != nullptr  {  m->kids.push_back shared_from_this   ;     OK  f->kids.push_back shared_from_this   ;     OK  You ﬁnd the whole resulting program in util enableshared1.cpp.  Note that you can’t call shared_from_this   inside the constructor  well, you can, but the  result is a runtime error :  class Person : public std::enable_shared_from_this  {  public:  ... Person  const string& n,  shared_ptr  m = nullptr, shared_ptr  f = nullptr   : name n , mother m , father f  {  if  m != nullptr  {  m->kids.push_back shared_from_this   ;     ERROR  } if  f != nullptr  {  f->kids.push_back shared_from_this   ;     ERROR  }  } ...  };  }  } ...  };  The problem is that shared_ptr stores itself in a private member of Person’s base class, enable_shared_from_this , at the end of the construction of the Person.  So, there is absolutely no way to create cyclic references of shared pointers during the construc- tion of the object that initializes the shared pointer. You have to do it in two steps — one way or the other.   92  Chapter 5: Utilities  5.2.4 Shared and Weak Pointers in Detail  Let’s summarize and present the whole interface that shared and weak pointers provide.  Class shared_ptr in Detail  As introduced in Section 5.2.1, page 76, class shared_ptr provides the concept of a smart pointer with shared ownership semantics. Whenever the last owner of a shared pointer gets destroyed, the associated object gets deleted  or the associated resources are cleaned up .  Class shared_ptr  is templatized for the type of the object the initial pointer refers to: namespace std {  template   class shared_ptr {  public:  typedef T element_type; ...  };  }  The element type might be void, which means that the shared pointer shares ownership of an object with an unspeciﬁed type, like void* does.  An empty shared_ptr does not share ownership of an object, so use_count   yields 0. Note,  however, that due to one special constructor, the shared pointer still might refer to an object.  Tables 5.3 and 5.4 list all operations provided for shared pointers. Whenever ownership is transferred to a shared pointer that already owned another object, the deleter for the previously owned object gets called if that shared pointer was the last owner. The same applies if a shared pointer gets a new value either by assigning a new value or by calling reset  : If the shared pointer previously owned an object and was the last owner, the corresponding deleter  or delete  gets called for the object. Note again that the passed deleter shall not throw.  The shared pointers might use different object types, provided that there is an implicit pointer conversion. For this reason, constructors, assignment operators, and reset   are member templates, whereas comparison operators are templatized for different types.  All comparison operators compare the raw pointers the shared pointers internally use  i.e., they call the same operator for the values returned by get   . They all have overloads for nullptr as argument. Thus, you can check whether there is a valid pointer or even whether the raw pointer is less than or greater than nullptr.  The constructor taking a weak_ptr argument throws bad_weak_ptr  see Section 5.2.2, page 89   if the weak pointer is empty  expired   yields true .   5.2 Smart Pointers  Operation shared_ptr  sp  shared_ptr  sp ptr   shared_ptr  sp ptr,del  shared_ptr  sp ptr,del,ac   shared_ptr  sp nullptr   93  Effect Default constructor; creates an empty shared pointer, using the default deleter  calling delete  Creates a shared pointer owning *ptr, using the default deleter  calling delete  Creates a shared pointer owning *ptr, using del as deleter Creates a shared pointer owning *ptr, using del as deleter and ac as allocator Creates an empty shared pointer, using the default deleter  calling delete   del,ac   shared_ptr  sp sp2,ptr   shared_ptr  sp sp2  shared_ptr  sp move sp2    shared_ptr  sp wp  shared_ptr  sp move up   shared_ptr  sp move ap   sp.~shared_ptr   sp = sp2  shared_ptr  sp nullptr,del  Creates an empty shared pointer, using del as deleter Creates an empty shared pointer, using del as deleter shared_ptr  sp nullptr, and ac as allocator Creates a shared pointer sharing ownership with sp2 Creates a shared pointer owning the pointer previously owned by sp2  sp2 is empty afterward  Alias constructor; creates a shared pointer sharing ownership of sp2 but referring to *ptr Creates a shared pointer out of a weak pointer wp Creates a shared pointer out of a unique_ptr up Creates a shared pointer out of an auto_ptr ap Destructor; calls the deleter if sp owns an object Assignment  sp shares ownership with sp2 afterward, giving up ownership of the object previously owned  Move assignment  sp2 transfers ownership to sp  Assigns unique_ptr up  up transfers ownership to sp  Assigns auto_ptr ap  ap transfers ownership to sp  Swaps pointers and deleters of sp1 and sp2 Swaps pointers and deleters of sp1 and sp2 Gives up ownership and reinitializes the shared pointer as being empty Gives up ownership and reinitializes the shared pointer owning *ptr, using the default deleter  calling delete  Gives up ownership and reinitializes the shared pointer owning *ptr, using del as deleter Gives up ownership and reinitializes the shared pointer owning *ptr, using del as deleter and ac as allocator Creates a shared pointer for a new object initialized by the passed arguments Creates a shared pointer for a new object initialized by the passed arguments, using allocator ac  sp = move sp2  sp = move up  sp = move ap  sp1.swap sp2  swap sp1,sp2  sp.reset    allocate_shared ac,...   sp.reset ptr,del,ac   sp.reset ptr,del   make_shared ...   sp.reset ptr   Table5.3.

Operationsof shared_ptrs,Part2  get_deleter   yields a pointer to the function deﬁned as a deleter, if any, or nullptr other- wise. The pointer is valid as long as a shared pointer owns that deleter. To get the deleter, however, you have to pass its type as a template argument. For example:  auto del = []  int* p  { delete p;  };  std::shared_ptr  decltype del * pd = std::get_deleter  p ;  p new int, del ;  Note that shared pointers do not provide a release   operation to give up ownership and return the control of an object back to the caller. The reason is that other shared pointers might still own the object.   5.2 Smart Pointers  95  More Sophisticated shared_ptr Operations  A few operations are provided that might not be obvious. Most of them were motivated and intro- duced with [N2351:SharedPtr].  The constructor taking another shared pointer and an additional raw pointer is the so-called alias-  ing constructor, which allows you to capture the fact that one object owns another. For example:  struct X {  int a;  }; shared_ptr  px new X ; shared_ptr  pi px, &px->a ;  The object of type X “owns” its member a, so to create a shared pointer to a, you need to keep the surrounding object alive by attaching to its reference count by means of the aliasing constructor. Other, more complex, examples exist, such as referring to a container element or to a shared library symbol.10  Note that, as a consequence, the programmer has to ensure that the lifetimes of both objects  match. Otherwise, dangling pointers or resource leaks might occur. For example:  shared_ptr  sp1 new X ; shared_ptr  sp2 sp1,new X ;     ERROR: delete for this X will never be called  sp1.reset  ; shared_ptr  sp3 sp1,new X ;     deletes ﬁrst X; makes sp1 empty    use_count  ==0, but get  !=nullptr  Both make_shared   and allocate_shared   are provided to optimize the creation of a shared object and its associated control block  for example, maintaining the use count . Note that  performs two allocations: one for X and one for the control block used, for example, by the shared pointer to manage its use count. Using  shared_ptr  new X ...    make_shared  ...   instead is considerably faster, performing only one allocation, and safer because a situation where the allocation of X succeeds but the control block fails cannot occur. allocate_shared   allows passing your own allocator as ﬁrst argument here.  the allocation of  The cast operators allow casting a pointer to a different type. The semantic is the same as the corresponding operators, and the result is another shared pointer of a different type. Note that using the ordinary cast operators is not possible, because it results in undeﬁned behavior:  shared_ptr  sp new int ; ... shared_ptr  static_cast  sp.get     static_pointer_cast  sp      shared pointer holds a void* internally     ERROR: undeﬁned behavior    OK  10 Thanks to Peter Dimov for pointing this out.   96  Chapter 5: Utilities  Class weak_ptr in Detail  As introduced in Section 5.2.2, page 84, class weak_ptr is a helper of class shared_ptr to share an object without owing it. Its use_count   returns the number of shared_ptr owners of an object, for which the weak_ptrs sharing the object do not count. Also, a weak_ptr can be empty, which is the case if it is not initialized by a shared_ptr or if the last owner of the corresponding object was deleted. Class weak_ptr  is also templatized for the type of the object the initial pointer refers to:  namespace std {  template   class weak_ptr {  public:  typedef T element_type; ...  };  }  Table 5.5 lists all operations provided for weak pointers.  The default constructor creates an empty weak pointer, which means that expired   yields true. Because lock   yields a shared pointer, the use count of the object increments for the lifetime of the shared pointer. This is the only way to deal with the object a weak pointer shares.  Thread-Safe Shared Pointer Interface  In general, shared pointers are not thread safe. Thus, to avoid undeﬁned behavior due to data races  see Section 18.4.1, page 982 , you have to use techniques, such as mutexes or locks, when shared pointers refer to the same object in multiple threads. However, reading the use count while another thread modiﬁes it does not introduce a data race, although the value might not be up-to-date. In fact, one thread might check a use count while another thread might manipulate it. See Chapter 18 for details.  Corresponding to the atomic C-style interface for ordinary pointers  see Section 18.7.3, page 1019 , overloaded versions for shared pointers are provided, which allow dealing with shared point- ers concurrently. Note that concurrent access to the pointers, not to the values they refer to, is meant.  For example:11 std::shared_ptr  global;     initially nullptr  void foo   {  }  std::shared_ptr  local{new X}; ... std::atomic_store &global,local ;  11 Thanks to Anthony Williams for providing this example.   5.2 Smart Pointers  Operation weak_ptr  wp weak_ptr  wp sp   weak_ptr  wp wp2   wp.~weak_ptr    wp = wp2  wp = sp  wp.swap wp2  swap wp1,wp2  wp.reset    wp.use_count    wp.expired    wp.lock    wp.owner_before wp2  wp.owner_before sp   97  Effect Default constructor; creates an empty weak pointer Creates a weak pointer sharing ownership of the pointer owned by sp Creates a weak pointer sharing ownership of the pointer owned by wp2 Destructor; destroys the weak pointer but has no effect on the object owned Assignment  wp shares ownership of wp2 afterward, giving up ownership of the object previously owned  Assigns shared pointer sp  wp shares ownership of sp afterward, giving up ownership of the object previously owned  Swaps the pointers of wp and wp2 Swaps the pointers of wp1 and wp2 Gives up ownership of owned object, if any, and reinitializes as empty weak pointer Returns the number of shared owners  shared_ptrs owning the object  or 0 if the weak pointer is empty Returns whether wp is empty  equivalent to wp.use_count  ==0 but might be faster  Returns a shared pointer sharing ownership of the pointer owned by the weak pointer  or an empty shared pointer if none  Provides a strict weak ordering with another weak pointer Provides a strict weak ordering with a shared pointer  Table5.5.

High-LevelAtomicOperationsofshared_ptr   98  Chapter 5: Utilities  5.2.5 Class unique_ptr  The unique_ptr type, provided by the C++ standard library since C++11, is a kind of a smart pointer that helps to avoid resource leaks when exceptions are thrown. In general, this smart pointer implements the concept of exclusive ownership, which means that it ensures that an object and its associated resources are “owned” only by one pointer at a time. When this owner gets destroyed or becomes empty or starts to own another object, the object previously owned also gets destroyed, and any associated resources are released.  Class unique_ptr succeeds class auto_ptr, which was originally introduced with C++98 but is deprecated now  see Section 5.2.7, page 113 . Class unique_ptr provides a simple and clearer interface, making it less error prone than auto_pointers have been.  Purpose of Class unique_ptr  Functions often operate in the following way:12 1. Acquire some resources. 2. Perform some operations. 3. Free the acquired resources. If bound to local objects, the resources acquired on entry get freed automatically on function exit because the destructors of those local objects are called. But if resources are acquired explicitly and are not bound to any object, they must be freed explicitly. Resources are typically managed explicitly when pointers are used.  A typical example of using pointers in this way is the use of new and delete to create and  destroy an object:  void f   {  }  ClassA* ptr = new ClassA; ... delete ptr;     create an object explicitly    perform some operations    clean up  destroy the object explicitly   This function is a source of trouble. One obvious problem is that the deletion of the object might be forgotten, especially if you have return statements inside the function. There also is a less obvious danger that an exception might occur. Such an exception would exit the function immediately, without calling the delete statement at the end of the function. The result would be a memory leak or, more generally, a resource leak.  12 This motivation, originally written for class auto_ptr, is adapted, with permission, from Scott Meyers’ book More Effective C++. The general technique was originally presented by Bjarne Stroustrup as the “resource allocation is initialization” idiom in his books The C++ Programming Language, 2nd edition and The Design and Evolution of C++.   5.2 Smart Pointers  99  Avoiding such a resource leak usually requires that a function catch all exceptions. For example:  ClassA* ptr = new ClassA;     create an object explicitly  void f   {  try { ...  } catch  ...  {  delete ptr; throw;  }  delete ptr;  }     perform some operations     for any exception    - clean up    - rethrow the exception     clean up on normal end  To handle the deletion of this object properly in the event of an exception, the code gets more complicated and redundant. If a second object is handled in this way, or if more than one catch clause is used, the problem gets worse. This is bad programming style and should be avoided because it is complex and error prone.  A smart pointer can help here. The smart pointer can free the data to which it points whenever the pointer itself gets destroyed. Furthermore, because it is a local variable, the pointer gets destroyed automatically when the function is exited, regardless of whether the exit is normal or is due to an exception. The class unique_ptr was designed to be such a smart pointer.  A unique_ptr is a pointer that serves as a unique owner of the object to which it refers. As a result, an object gets destroyed automatically when its unique_ptr gets destroyed. A requirement of a unique_ptr is that its object have only one owner.  Here is the previous example rewritten to use a unique_ptr:    header ﬁle for unique_ptr include    void f   {  ...  }     create and initialize an unique_ptr std::unique  ptr new ClassA ;     perform some operations  That’s all. The delete statement and the catch clause are no longer necessary.   100  Using a unique_ptr  Chapter 5: Utilities  A unique_ptr has much the same interface as an ordinary pointer; that is, operator * dereferences the object to which it points, whereas operator -> provides access to a member if the object is a class or a structure:     create and initialize  pointer to  string: std::unique_ptr  up new std::string "nico"  ;   *up [0] = ’N’; up->append "lai" ; std::cout << *up << std::endl;    print whole string     replace ﬁrst character    append some characters  However, no pointer arithmetic, such as ++, is deﬁned  this counts as an advantage because pointer arithmetic is a source of trouble .  Note that class unique_ptr  does not allow you to initialize an object with an ordinary pointer by using the assignment syntax. Thus, you must initialize the unique_ptr directly, by using its value:  std::unique_ptr  up = new int; std::unique_ptr  up new int ;     ERROR    OK  A unique_ptr does not have to own an object, so it can be empty.13 This is, for example, the case when it is initialized with the default constructor:  std::unique_ptr  up;  You can also assign the nullptr or call reset   :  up = nullptr; up.reset  ;  In addition, you can call release  , which yields the object a unique_ptr owned, and gives up ownership so that the caller is responsible for its object now:  std::unique_ptr  up new std::string "nico"  ; ... std::string* sp = up.release  ;     up loses ownership  You can check whether a unique pointer owns an object by calling operator bool  :  if  up  {     if up is not empty  std::cout << *up << std::endl;  }  Instead, you can also compare the unique pointer with nullptr or query the raw pointer inside the unique_ptr, which yields nullptr if the unique_ptr doesn’t own any object:  if  up != nullptr      if up is not empty  if  up.get   != nullptr      if up is not empty  13 Although the C++ standard library does deﬁne the term empty only for shared pointers, I don’t see any reason not to do that in general.   5.2 Smart Pointers  101  Transfer of Ownership by unique_ptr  A unique_ptr provides the semantics of exclusive ownership. However, it’s up to the programmer to ensure that no two unique pointers are initialized by the same pointer:  std::string* sp = new std::string "hello" ; std::unique_ptr  up1 sp ; std::unique_ptr  up2 sp ;     ERROR: up1 and up2 own same data  Unfortunately, this is a runtime error, so the programmer has to avoid such a mistake.  This leads to the question of how the copy constructor and the assignment operator of unique_ptrs operate. The answer is simple: You can’t copy or assign a unique pointer if you use the ordinary copy semantics. However, you can use the move semantics provided since C++11  see Section 3.1.5, page 19 . In that case, the constructor or assignment operator transfers the ownership to another unique pointer.14  Consider, for example, the following use of the copy constructor:    initialize a unique_ptr with a new object std::unique_ptr  up1 new ClassA ;     copy the unique_ptr std::unique_ptr  up2 up1 ;     ERROR: not possible     transfer ownership of the unique_ptr std::unique_ptr  up3 std::move up1  ;     OK  After the ﬁrst statement, up1 owns the object that was created with the new operator. The second, which tries to call the copy constructor, is a compile-time error because up2 can’t become another owner of that object. Only one owner at a time is allowed. However, with the third statement, we transfer ownership from up1 to up3. So afterward, up3 owns the object created with new, and up1 no longer owns the object. The object created by new ClassA gets deleted exactly once: when up3 gets destroyed.  The assignment operator behaves similarly:    initialize a unique_ptr with a new object std::unique_ptr  up1 new ClassA ; std::unique_ptr  up2;     create another unique_ptr  up2 = up1;     ERROR: not possible  up2 = std::move up1 ;     assign the unique_ptr    - transfers ownership from up1 to up2  Here, the move assignment transfers ownership from up1 to up2. As a result, up2 owns the object previously owned by up1.  14 Here is the major difference with auto_ptr, which did transfer the ownership with the ordinary copy seman- tics, resulting in a source of trouble and confusion.   102  Chapter 5: Utilities  If up2 owned an object before an assignment, delete is called for that object:     initialize a unique_ptr with a new object std::unique_ptr  up1 new ClassA ;    initialize another unique_ptr with a new object std::unique_ptr  up2 new ClassA ;  up2 = std::move up1 ;     move assign the unique_ptr    - delete object owned by up2    - transfer ownership from up1 to up2  A unique_ptr that loses the ownership of an object without getting a new ownership refers to no object.  To assign a new value to a unique_ptr, this new value must also be a unique_ptr. You can’t  assign an ordinary pointer:  std::unique_ptr  ptr;     create a unique_ptr  ptr = new ClassA; ptr = std::unique_ptr  new ClassA ;    OK, delete old object     ERROR      and own new  Assigning nullptr is also possible, which has the same effect as calling reset  :  up = nullptr;     deletes the associated object, if any  Source and Sink  The transfer of ownership implies a special use for unique_ptrs; that is, functions can use them to transfer ownership to other functions. This can occur in two ways: 1. A function can behave as a sink of data. This happens if a unique_ptr is passed as an argument to the function by rvalue reference created with std::move  . In this case, the parameter of the called function gets ownership of the unique_ptr. Thus, if the function does not transfer it again, the object gets deleted on function exit:  void sink std::unique_ptr  up  {     sink   gets ownership  ...  }  std::unique_ptr  up new ClassA ; ... sink std::move up  ; ...     up loses ownership   5.2 Smart Pointers  103  2. A function can behave as a source of data. When a unique_ptr is returned, ownership of the returned value gets transferred to the calling context. The following example shows this technique:15  std::unique_ptr  source   {  std::unique_ptr  ptr new ClassA ;    ptr owns the new object ... return ptr;     transfer ownership to calling function  }  void g   {  std::unique_ptr  p;  for  int i=0; i<10; ++i  {  p = source  ;  ...  }  }    last-owned object of p gets deleted     p gets ownership of the returned object     previously returned object of f   gets deleted   Each time source   is called, it creates an object with new and returns the object, along with its ownership, to the caller. The assignment of the return value to p transfers ownership to p. In the second and additional passes through the loop, the assignment to p deletes the object that p owned previously. Leaving g  , and thus destroying p, results in the destruction of the last object owned by p. In any case, no resource leak is possible. Even if an exception is thrown, any unique_ptr that owns data ensures that this data is deleted.  The reason that no std::move   is necessary in the return statement of source   is that according to the language rules of C++11, the compiler will try a move automatically  see Sec- tion 3.1.5, page 22 .  unique_ptrs as Members  By using unique_ptrs within a class, you can also avoid resource leaks. If you use a unique_ptr instead of an ordinary pointer, you no longer need a destructor because the object gets deleted with the deletion of the member. In addition, a unique_ptr helps to avoid resource leaks caused by exceptions thrown during the initialization of an object. Note that destructors are called only if any construction is completed. So, if an exception occurs inside a constructor, destructors are called only for objects that have been fully constructed. This can result in resource leaks for classes with multiple raw pointers if during the construction the ﬁrst new was successful but the second was not. For example:  15 If you assume to declare the return type as rvalue reference, don’t do that; doing so would return a dangling pointer  see Section 3.1.5, page 22 .   104  Chapter 5: Utilities  class ClassB {  private:  ClassA* ptr1; ClassA* ptr2;  public:     pointer members     constructor that initializes the pointers    - will cause resource leak if second new throws ClassB  int val1, int val2   : ptr1 new ClassA val1  , ptr2 new ClassA val2   {     copy constructor    - might cause resource leak if second new throws ClassB  const ClassB& x   : ptr1 new ClassA *x.ptr1  , ptr2 new ClassA *x.ptr2   {     assignment operator const ClassB& operator=  const ClassB& x  {  *ptr1 = *x.ptr1; *ptr2 = *x.ptr2; return *this;  ~ClassB    {  delete ptr1; delete ptr2;  } ...  };  class ClassB {  private:  To avoid such a possible resource leak, you can simply use unique_ptrs:  std::unique_ptr  ptr1; std::unique_ptr  ptr2;  public:     constructor that initializes the unique_ptrs    - no resource leak possible ClassB  int val1, int val2      unique_ptr members  : ptr1 new ClassA val1  , ptr2 new ClassA val2   {  }  }  }  }   5.2 Smart Pointers  105     copy constructor    - no resource leak possible ClassB  const ClassB& x   : ptr1 new ClassA *x.ptr1  , ptr2 new ClassA *x.ptr2   {  }  }  };     assignment operator const ClassB& operator=  const ClassB& x  {  *ptr1 = *x.ptr1; *ptr2 = *x.ptr2; return *this;     no destructor necessary     default destructor lets ptr1 and ptr2 delete their objects  ...  Note, ﬁrst, that you can skip the destructor now because unique_ptr does the job for you. You also have to implement the copy constructor and assignment operator. By default, both would try to copy or assign the members, which isn’t possible. If you don’t provide them, ClassB also would provide only move semantics.  Dealing with Arrays  By default, unique_ptrs call delete for an object they own if they lose ownership  because they are destroyed, get a new object assigned, or become empty . Unfortunately, due to the language rules derived from C, C++ can’t differentiate between the type of a pointer to one object and an array of objects. However, according to language rules for arrays, operator delete[] rather than delete has to get called. So, the following is possible but wrong:  std::unique_ptr  up new std::string[10] ;     runtime ERROR  Now, you might assume that as for class shared_ptr  see Section 5.2.1, page 80 , you have to deﬁne your own deleter to deal with arrays. But this is not necessary.  Fortunately, the C++ standard library provides a partial specialization of class unique_ptr for arrays, which calls delete[ ] for the referenced object when the pointer loses the ownership to it. So, you simply have to declare:  std::unique_ptr  up new std::string[10] ;     OK  Note, however, that this partial specialization offers a slightly different interface. Instead of operators * and ->, operator [ ] is provided to access one of the objects inside the referenced array:  std::unique_ptr  up new std::string[10] ; ... std::cout << *up << std::endl; std::cout << up[0] << std::endl;     ERROR: * not deﬁned for arrays    OK     OK   106  Chapter 5: Utilities  As usual, it’s up to the programmer to ensure that the index is valid. Using an invalid index results in undeﬁned behavior.  Note also that this class does not allow getting initialized by an array of a derived type. This  reﬂects that fact that polymorphism does not work for plain arrays.  Class default_delete   Let’s look a bit into the declaration of class unique_ptr. Conceptionally, this class is declared as follows:16  namespace std {     primary template: template  > class unique_ptr {  public:  ... T& operator*   const; T* operator->   const noexcept; ...  };     partial specialization for arrays: template  class unique_ptr  {  public:  ... T& operator[] size_t i  const; ...  }  }  Here, we can see that there is a special version of unique_ptr to deal with arrays. That version provides operator [ ] instead of operators * and -> to deal with arrays rather than single objects. But both use class std::default_delete  as deleter, which itself is specialized to call delete[ ] instead of delete for arrays:  namespace std {     primary template: template   class default_delete {  public:  void operator   T* p  const;     calls delete p  16 In the C++ standard library, class unique_ptr is actually more complicated because some template magic is used to specify the exact return type for operators * and ->.   5.2 Smart Pointers  107  ...  };  public:  };  }     partial specialization for arrays: template   class default_delete  {  void operator   T* p  const; ...     calls delete[] p  Note that default template arguments automatically also apply to partial specializations.  Deleters for Other Associated Resources  When the object you refer to requires something other than calling delete or delete[ ], you have to specify your own deleter. Note, however, that the approach to deﬁning a deleter differs slightly from that for shared_ptrs. You have to specify the type of the deleter as second template argument. That type can be a reference to a function, function pointer, or function object  see Section 6.10, page 233 . If a function object is used, its “function call operator”    should be declared to take a pointer to the object.  For example, the following code prints an additional message before deleting an object with  delete:  class ClassADeleter {  public:  void operator     ClassA* p  {  std::cout << "call delete for ClassA object" << std::endl; delete p;  }  }; ...  or  std::unique_ptr  up new ClassA   ;  To specify a function or a lambda, you have to either declare the type of the deleter as void *  T*  or std::function  or use decltype  see Section 3.1.11, page 32 . For example, to use your own deleter for an array of ints speciﬁed as a lambda, this looks as follows:  std::unique_ptr  up new int[10], [] int* p  {  ... delete[] p;  } ;   std::unique_ptr > up new int[10], [] int* p  {  Chapter 5: Utilities  ... delete[] p;  } ;  108  or  auto l = [] int* p  {  ... delete[] p;  };  std::unique_ptr > up new int[10], l ;  To avoid having to specify the type of the deleter when passing a function pointer or a lambda, you could also use an alias template, a language feature provided since C++11  see Section 3.1.9, page 27 :  template   using uniquePtr = std::unique_ptr ; ...     alias template  uniquePtr  up new int[10], [] int* p  {     used here  ... delete[] p;  } ;  This way, you would have more or less the same interface to specify deleters as for shared_ptrs.  Here is a complete example of using your own deleter:     for unique_ptr    for opendir  , ...    for strerror      for errno     util uniqueptr1.cpp  include   include   include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  class DirCloser {  public:  }  }  };  void operator     DIR* dp  { if  closedir dp  != 0  {  std::cerr << "OOPS: closedir   failed" << std::endl;   109  5.2 Smart Pointers  int main   {     open current directory: unique_ptr  pDir opendir "."  ;     process each directory entry: struct dirent *dp; while   dp = readdir pDir.get     != nullptr  {  string filename dp->d_name ; cout << "process " << filename << endl; ...  }  }  Here, inside main  , we deal with the entries of the current directory, using the standard POSIX interface of opendir  , readdir  , and closedir  . To ensure that in any case the directory opened is closed by closedir  , we deﬁne a unique_ptr, which causes the DirCloser to be called whenever the handle referring to the opened directory gets destroyed. As for shared pointers, deleters for unique pointers may not throw. For this reason, we print only an error message here.  Another advantage of using a unique_ptr is that no copies are possible. Note that readdir   is not stateless, so it’s a good idea to ensure that while using a handle to deal with a directory, a copy of the handle can’t modify its state.  If you don’t want to process the return value of closedir  , you could also pass closedir   directly as a function pointer, specifying that the deleter is a function pointer. But beware: The often recommended declaration  unique_ptr  pDir opendir "." ,  closedir ;     might not work  is not guaranteed to be portable, because closedir has extern "C" linkage, so in C++ code, this is not guaranteed to be convertible into int *  DIR* . For portable code, you would need an intermediate type deﬁnition like this:17  extern "C" typedef int *DIRDeleter  DIR* ; unique_ptr  pDir opendir "." ,  closedir ;     OK  Note that closedir   returns an int, so we have to specify int *  DIR*  as the type of the deleter. Note, however, that a call through a function pointer is an indirect call, which is harder to optimize away.  See Section 15.12.3, page 822, for another example of using your own unique_ptr deleter to  restore a redirected output buffer.  17 Thanks to Daniel Krugler for pointing this out.  ¨   110  Chapter 5: Utilities  5.2.6 Class unique_ptr in Detail  As introduced in Section 5.2.5, page 98, class unique_ptr provides the concept of a smart pointer with exclusive ownership semantics. Once a unique pointer has exclusive control, you cannot  acci- dentally  create a situation in which multiple pointers own the associated object. The major goal is to ensure that with the end of the pointer’s lifetime, the associated object gets deleted  or its resource gets cleaned up . This especially helps to provide exception safety. In contrast to shared pointers, a minimum space and time overhead is the focus of this class.  Class unique_ptr  is templatized for the type of the object the initial pointer refers to and its  deleter:  namespace std {  template  > class unique_ptr {  public:  typedef ... pointer; typedef T element_type; typedef D deleter_type; ...     may be D::pointer  A partial specialization for arrays is provided  note that by language rules, it has the same default deleter, which is default_delete  then :  };  }  };  }  namespace std {  template   class unique_ptr  {  public:  typedef ... pointer; typedef T element_type; typedef D deleter_type; ...     may be D::pointer  If the deleter D has a pointer typedef, this type will be used instead.  The element type T might be void so that the unique pointer owns an object with an unspeciﬁed type, like void* does. Note also that a type pointer is deﬁned, which is not necessarily deﬁned as T*. In such a case, the template parameter T has only the effect of a type tag, because there is no member as part of class unique_ptr  that depends on T; everything depends on pointer. The advantage is that a unique_ptr can thus hold other smart pointers.  If a unique_ptr is empty, it does not own an object, so get   returns the nullptr.

Operationsof unique_ptrs   112  Chapter 5: Utilities  The constructor taking a pointer and a deleter as arguments is overloaded for different types, so  the following behavior is speciﬁed:  D d; unique_ptr  p1 new int, D   ; unique_ptr  p2 new int, d ; unique_ptr  p3 new int, d ; unique_ptr  p4 new int, D   ;    Error: rvalue deleter object     instance of the deleter type    D must be MoveConstructible    D must be CopyConstructible    p3 holds a reference to d     can’t have reference deleter type  For single objects, the move constructor and the assignment operator are member templates, so a type conversion is possible. All comparison operators are templatized for different element and deleter types.  All comparison operators compare the raw pointers the shared pointers internally use  call the same operator for the values returned by get   . They all have overloads for nullptr as argument. Thus, you can check whether there is a valid pointer or even if the raw pointer is less than or greater than nullptr.  The specialization for array types has the following differences compared to the single-object  interface:   Instead of operators * and ->, operator [ ] is provided.   The default deleter calls delete[ ] rather than just delete.   Conversions between different types are not supported. Pointers to derived element types are  especially not possible.  Note that the deleter interface differs from class shared_ptr  see Section 5.2.1, page 80, for details . However, as for shared pointers, deleters shall not throw.   5.2 Smart Pointers  5.2.7 Class auto_ptr  113  Unlike C++11, the C++98 standard library provided only one smart pointer class, auto_ptr, which is deprecated since C++11. Its goal was to provide the semantics that unique_ptr now does. However, class auto_ptr introduced a few problems:   At the time of its design, the language had no move semantics for constructors and assignment operators. However, the goal was still to provide the semantics of ownership transfer. As a result, copy and assignment operators got a move semantic, which could cause serious trouble, especially when passing an auto_ptr as argument.   There was no semantic of a deleter, so you could use it only to deal with single objects allocated   Because this was initially the only smart pointer provided by the C++ standard library, it was often misused, especially assuming that it provided the semantics of shared ownership as class shared_ptr does now.  with new.  Regarding the danger of unintended loss of ownership, consider the following example, consisting of a naive implementation of a function that prints the object to which an auto_ptr refers:     p gets ownership of passed argument     this is a bad example template   void bad_print std::auto_ptr  p  {     does p own an object ? if  p.get   == NULL  {  std::cout << "NULL";  } else {  }  }  std::cout << *p;     Oops, exiting deletes the object to which p refers  Whenever an auto_ptr is passed to this implementation of bad_print  , the objects it owns, if any, are deleted. The reason is that the ownership of the auto_ptr that is passed as an argument is passed to the parameter p, and p deletes the object it owns on function exit. This is probably not the programmer’s intention and would result in fatal runtime errors:  std::auto_ptr  p new int ; *p = 42; bad_print p ; *p = 18;     change value to which p refers    Oops, deletes the memory to which p refers    RUNTIME ERROR  That behavior especially applies when passing an auto_ptr to a container. With unique_ptr, such a mistake is no longer possible, because you explicitly would have to pass the argument with std::move  .   114  Chapter 5: Utilities  5.2.8 Final Words on Smart Pointers  As we have seen, C++11 provides two concepts of a smart pointer: 1. shared_ptr for shared ownership 2. unique_ptr for exclusive ownership The latter replaces the old auto_ptr of C++98, which is deprecated now.  Performance Issues  You might wonder why the C++ standard library not only provides one smart pointer class with shared ownership semantics because this also avoids resource leaks or transfers ownership. The answer has to do with the performance impact of shared pointers.  Class shared_ptr is implemented with a nonintrusive  noninvasive  approach, which means that objects managed by this class don’t have to fulﬁll a speciﬁc requirement, such as a common base class. The big advantage is that this concept can be applied to any type, including fundamental data types. The price is that a shared_ptr object internally needs multiple members: an ordinary pointer to the referenced object and a reference counter shared by all shared pointers that refer to the same object. Because weak pointers might refer to a shared object, you even need another counter.  Even if no more shared pointer uses an object, you need the counter until all weak pointers end referring to it; otherwise, you can’t guarantee that they return a use_count   of 0. 18  Thus, shared and weak pointers internally need additional helper objects, to which internal point- ers refer, which means that a couple of speciﬁc optimizations are not possible  including empty base class optimizations, which would allow elimination of any memory overhead .  Unique pointers do not require any of this overhead. Their “smartness” is based on special con- structors and special destructors and the elimination of copy semantics. With a stateless or empty deleter a unique pointer should consume the same amount of memory as a native pointer, and there should be no runtime overhead compared to using native pointers and doing the deletes manually. However, to avoid the introduction of unnecessary overhead, you should use function objects  in- cluding lambdas  for deleters to allow the best optimizations with, ideally, zero overhead.  Usage Issues  Smart pointers are not perfect, and you still have to know which problems they solve and which problems remain. For example, for any smart pointer class, you should never create multiple smart pointers out of the same ordinary pointer.  See Section 7.11, page 388, for an example of using shared pointers in multiple STL containers. Classes shared_ptr and unique_ptr provide different approaches to deal with arrays and deleters. Class unique_ptr has a partial specialization for arrays, which provides a different in- terface. It is more ﬂexible and provides less performance overhead but might require a bit more work to use it.  Finally, note that in general, smart pointers are not thread safe, although some guarantees apply.  See Section 5.2.4, page 96, for details.  18 Thanks to Howard Hinnant for pointing this out.   5.3 Numeric Limits  115  5.3 Numeric Limits  Numeric types in general have platform-dependent limits. The C++ standard library provides these limits in the template numeric_limits. These numeric limits replace and supplement the ordinary preprocessor C constants, which are still available for integer types in   and   and for ﬂoating-point types in   and  . The new concept of numeric limits has two advantages: First, it offers more type safety. Second, it enables a programmer to write templates that evaluate these limits.  The numeric limits are discussed in the rest of this section. Note, however, that it is always better to write platform-independent code by using the minimum guaranteed precision of the types. These minimum values are provided in Table 5.8.19  Type char short int int long int long long int float double long double  Minimum Size 1 byte  8 bits  2 bytes 2 bytes 4 bytes 8 bytes 4 bytes 8 bytes 8 bytes  Table5.8. MinimumSizeofBuilt-InTypes  Class numeric_limits   You usually use templates to implement something once for any type. However, you can also use templates to provide a common interface that is implemented for each type, where it is useful. You can do this by providing specializations of a general template. A typical example of this technique is numeric_limits, which works as follows:   A general template provides the default numeric values for any type:  namespace std {     general numeric limits as default for any type template   class numeric_limits {  public:     by default no specialization for any type T exists static constexpr bool is_specialized = false;  19 Note that “bytes” means an octet with 8 bits. Strictly speaking, it is possible that even a long int has one byte with at least 32 bits.   ...     other members are meaningless for the general template  Chapter 5: Utilities  116  };  }  This general template of the numeric limits says that no numeric limits are available for type T. This is done by setting the member is_specialized to false.    Specializations of the template deﬁne the numeric limits for each numeric type as follows:  namespace std {     numeric limits for int    - implementation deﬁned template  class numeric_limits  {  public:     yes, a specialization for numeric limits of int does exist static constexpr bool is_specialized = true;  static constexpr int min   noexcept {  return -2147483648;  } static constexpr int max   noexcept {  return 2147483647;  } static constexpr int digits = 31; ...  };  }  Here, is_specialized is set to true, and all other members have the values of the numeric limits for the particular type.  The general numeric_limits template and its standard specializations are provided in the header ﬁle  . The specializations are provided for any fundamental type that can represent numeric values: bool, char, signed char, unsigned char, char16_t, char32_t, wchar_t, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long, float, double, and long double.20 They can be supplemented easily for user-deﬁned numeric types.  Tables 5.9 and 5.10 list all members of the class numeric_limits  and their meanings. Appli- cable corresponding C constants for these members, deﬁned in  ,  ,  , and  , are also given.  20 The specializations for char16_t, char32_t, long long, and unsigned long long are provided since C++11.   117  C Constants  INT_MIN,FLT_MIN, CHAR_MIN,...

MembersofClass numeric_limits ,Part2  The following is a possible full specialization of the numeric limits for type float, which is platform dependent and shows the exact signatures of the members:  namespace std {  public:  template  class numeric_limits  {     yes, a specialization for numeric limits of float does exist static constexpr bool is_specialized = true;  inline constexpr float min   noexcept {  return 1.17549435E-38F;  } inline constexpr float max   noexcept {  return 3.40282347E+38F;  } inline constexpr float lowest   noexcept {  return -3.40282347E+38F;  }  static constexpr int digits = 24; static constexpr int digits10 = 6; static constexpr int max_digits10 = 9;  static constexpr bool is_signed = true; static constexpr bool is_integer = false; static constexpr bool is_exact = false; static constexpr bool is_bounded = true; static constexpr bool is_modulo = false; static constexpr bool is_iec559 = true;   5.3 Numeric Limits  119  static constexpr int radix = 2;  inline constexpr float epsilon   noexcept {  return 1.19209290E-07F;  static constexpr float_round_style round_style  inline constexpr float round_error   noexcept {  = round_to_nearest;  return 0.5F;  }  }  static constexpr int min_exponent = -125; static constexpr int max_exponent = +128; static constexpr int min_exponent10 = -37; static constexpr int max_exponent10 = +38;  static constexpr bool has_infinity = true; inline constexpr float infinity   noexcept { return ...; } static constexpr bool has_quiet_NaN = true; inline constexpr float quiet_NaN   noexcept { return ...; } static constexpr bool has_signaling_NaN = true; inline constexpr float signaling_NaN   noexcept { return ...; } static constexpr float_denorm_style has_denorm = denorm_absent; static constexpr bool has_denorm_loss = false; inline constexpr float denorm_min   noexcept { return min  ; }  static constexpr bool traps = true; static constexpr bool tinyness_before = true;  };  }  Note that since C++11, all members are declared as constexpr  see Section 3.1.8, page 26 . For example, you can use max   at places where compile-time expressions are required:  static const int ERROR_VALUE = std::numeric_limits ::max  ; float a[std::numeric_limits ::max  ];  Before C++11, all nonfunction members were constant and static, so their values could be deter- mined at compile time. However, function members were static only, so the preceding expressions were not possible. Also note that before C++11, lowest   and max_digits10 were not provided and that empty exception speciﬁcations instead of noexcept  see Section 3.1.7, page 24  were used. The values of round_style are shown in Table 5.11. The values of has_denorm are shown in Table 5.12. Unfortunately, the member has_denorm is not called denorm_style. This happened because during the standardization process, there was a late change from a Boolean to an enumerative value. However, you can use the has_denorm member as a Boolean value because the standard   120  Chapter 5: Utilities  Round Style Meaning Rounds toward zero round_toward_zero Rounds to the nearest representable value round_to_nearest Rounds toward positive inﬁnity round_toward_infinity round_toward_neg_infinity Rounds toward negative inﬁnity round_indeterminate  Indeterminable  Table5.11. RoundStyleofnumeric_limits   Denorm Style denorm_absent denorm_present  denorm_indeterminate  Meaning The type does not allow denormalized values The type allows denormalized values to the nearest representable value Indeterminable  Table5.12. DenormalizationStyleofnumeric_limits   guarantees that denorm_absent is 0, which is equivalent to false, whereas denorm_present is 1 and denorm_indeterminate is -1, both of which are equivalent to true. Thus, you can consider has_denorm a Boolean indication of whether the type may allow denormalized values.  Example of Using numeric_limits   The following example shows possible uses of some numeric limits, such as the maximum values for certain types and determining whether char is signed:     util limits1.cpp  include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {     use textual representation for bool cout << boolalpha;     print maximum of integral types cout  ::max   << endl; cout << "max int : cout << "max long : cout << endl;  "  ::max   << endl; "  ::max   << endl;   5.3 Numeric Limits  121     print maximum of ﬂoating-point types cout << "max float :  "   ::max   << endl;  cout << "max double :  "   ::max   << endl;  cout << "max long double : "   ::max   << endl;  cout << endl;     print whether char is signed cout << "is_signed char : "   ::is_signed << endl;  cout << endl;     print whether numeric limits for type string exist cout << "is_specialized string : "   ::is_specialized << endl;  }  The output of this program is platform dependent. Here is a possible output of the program:  max short : 32767 max int : max long :  2147483647 2147483647  3.40282e+38 max float : max double : 1.79769e+308 max long double : 1.79769e+308  is_signed char : false  is_specialized string : false  The last line shows that no numeric limits are deﬁned for the type string. This makes sense because strings are not numeric values. However, this example shows that you can query for any arbitrary type whether or not it has numeric limits deﬁned.   122  Chapter 5: Utilities  5.4 Type Traits and Type Utilities  Almost everything in the C++ standard library is template based. To support the programming of templates, sometimes called metaprogramming, template utilities are provided to help both program- mers and library implementers.  Type traits, which were introduced with TR1 and extended with C++11, provide a mechanism to deﬁne behavior depending on types. They can be used to optimize code for types that provide special abilities.  Other utilities, such as reference and function wrappers, might also be helpful.  5.4.1 Purpose of Type Traits  A type trait provides a way to deal with the properties of a type. It is a template, which at compile time yields a speciﬁc type or value based on one or more passed template arguments, which are usually types.  Consider the following example: template   void foo  const T& val  {  } else {  } ...  }  if  std::is_pointer ::value  {  std::cout << "foo   called for a pointer" << std::endl;  std::cout << "foo   called for a value" << std::endl;  Here, the trait std::is_pointer, deﬁned in  , is used to check whether type T is a pointer type. In fact, is_pointer  yields either a type true_type or a type false_type, for which ::value either yields true or false. As a consequence, foo   will output  foo   called for a pointer  if the passed parameter val is a pointer.  Note, however, that you can’t do something like: template   void foo  const T& val  {  std::cout  ::value ? *val : val   << std::endl;  }  The reason is that code is generated for both *val and val. Even when passing an int so that the expression is_pointer ::value yields false at compile time, the code expands to:   5.4 Type Traits and Type Utilities  123  cout <<  false ? *val : val  << endl;  And this won’t compile, because *val is an invalid expression for ints.  But you can do the following:    foo   implementation for pointer types: template   void foo_impl  const T& val, std::true_type  {  std::cout << "foo   called for pointer to " << *val  << std::endl;     foo   implementation for non-pointer types: template   void foo_impl  const T& val, std::false_type  {  std::cout << "foo   called for value to " << val  << std::endl;  template   void foo  const T& val  {  foo_impl  val, std::is_pointer    ;  Here, inside foo  , the expression  std::is_pointer     }  }  }  at compile time yields std::true_type or std::false_type, which deﬁnes which of the pro- vided foo_impl   overloads gets instantiated.  Why is that better than providing two overloads of foo  : one for ordinary types and one for  pointer types?  template   void foo  const T& val ;     general implementation  template   void foo   const T& val ;     partial specialization for pointers  One answer is that sometimes, too many overloads are necessary. In general, the power of type traits comes more from the fact that they are building blocks for generic code, which can be demonstrated by two examples.   124  Chapter 5: Utilities  Flexible Overloading for Integral Types  In [Becker:LibExt], Pete Becker gives a nice example, which I modiﬁed slightly here. Suppose that you have a function foo   that should be implemented differently for integral and ﬂoating-point type arguments. The usual approach would be to overload this function for all available integral and ﬂoating-point types:21     provide integral version  void foo  short ; void foo  unsigned short ; void foo  int ; ... void foo  float ; void foo  double ; void foo  long double ;     provide ﬂoating-point version  This repetition is not only tedious but also introduces the problem that it might not work for new integral or ﬂoating-point types, either provided by the standard, such as long long, or provided as user-deﬁned types.  With the type traits, you can provide the following instead: template   void foo_impl  T val, true_type ;     provide integral version  template   void foo_impl  T val, false_type ;     provide ﬂoating-point version  template   void foo  T val  {  }  foo_impl  val, std::is_integral    ;  Thus, you provide two implementations — one for integral and one for ﬂoating-point types — and choose the right implementation according to what std::is_integral  yields for the type.  Processing the Common Type  Another example for the usability of type traits is the need to process the “common type” of two or more types. This is a type I could use to deal with the values of two different types, provided there is a common type. For example, it would be an appropriate type of the minimum or the sum of two values of different type. Otherwise, if I want to implement a function that yields the minimum of two values of different types, which return type should it have:  template   ??? min  const T1& x, const T2& y ;  21 According to the C++ standard, the term integral type includes bool and character types, but that’s not meant here.   5.4 Type Traits and Type Utilities  125  Using the type traits, you can simply use the std::common_type  to declare this type:  template   typename std::common_type ::type min  const T1& x, const T2& y ;  For example, the expression std::common_type ::type yields int if both arguments are int, long, if one is int and the other is long, or std::string if one is a string and the other is a string literal  type const char* .  How does it do that? Well, it simply uses the rules implemented for operator ?:, which has to yield one result type based on the types of both operands. In fact, std::common_type  is implemented as follows:  template   struct common_type  {  typedef decltype true ? declval    : declval     type;  where decltype is a new keyword in C++11  see Section 3.1.11, page 32  to yield the type of an expression, and declval  is an auxiliary trait to provide a declared value of the passed type without evaluating it  generating an rvalue reference for it .  Thus, when operator ?: is able to ﬁnd a common type, common_type  will yield it. If not, you can still provide an overload of common_type   this, for example, is used by the chrono library to be able to combine durations; see Section 5.7.2, page 145 .  5.4.2 Type Traits in Detail  The type traits are usually deﬁned in  .   Unary  Type Predicates  As introduced in Section 5.4.1, page 122, the type predicates yield std::true_type if a spe- ciﬁc property applies and std::false_type if not. These types are specialization of the helper std::integral_constant, so their corresponding value members yield true or false:  namespace std {  template   struct integral_constant {  static constexpr T value = val; typedef T value_type; typedef integral_constant  type; constexpr operator value_type   {  return value;  }  }; typedef integral_constant  typedef integral_constant  false_type;  true_type;  };  }   126  Trait is_void  is_integral   is_floating_point  is_arithmetic   is_signed  is_unsigned  is_const  is_volatile  is_array  is_enum  is_union  is_class  is_function  is_reference  is_lvalue_reference  is_rvalue_reference  is_pointer   is_member_pointer  is_member_object_pointer  is_member_function_pointer  is_fundamental   is_scalar   is_object  is_compound   is_trivial  is_trivially_copyable  is_standard_layout  is_pod   is_literal_type   Chapter 5: Utilities  Effect Type void Integral type  including bool, char, char16_t, char32_t, wchar_t  Floating-point type  float, double, long double  Integral  including bool and characters  or ﬂoating-point type Signed arithmetic type Unsigned arithmetic type const qualiﬁed volatile qualiﬁed Ordinary array type  not type std::array  Enumeration type Union type Class struct type but not a union type Function type Lvalue or rvalue reference Lvalue reference Rvalue reference Pointer type  including function pointer but not pointer to nonstatic member  Pointer to nonstatic member Pointer to a nonstatic data member Pointer to a nonstatic member function void, integral  including bool and characters , ﬂoating-point, or std::nullptr_t Integral  including bool and characters , ﬂoating-point, enumeration, pointer, member pointer, std::nullptr_t Any type except void, function, or reference Array, enumeration, union, class, function, reference, or pointer Scalar, trivial class, or arrays of these types Scalar, trivially copyable class, or arrays of these types Scalar, standard layout class, or arrays of these types Plain old data type  type where memcpy   works to copy objects  Scalar, reference, class, or arrays of these types  Table5.13.

TraitstoCheckTypePropertiesofClassTypes  Note that bool and all character types  char, char16_t, char32_t, and wchar_t  count as integral types and that type std::nullptr_t  see Section 3.1.1, page 14  counts as a fundamental data type.  Most, but not all, of these traits are unary. That is, they use one template argument. For example,  is_const  checks whether the passed type is const:  is_const ::value is_const ::value     false    true   128  Chapter 5: Utilities  is_const ::value is_const ::value is_const ::value is_const ::value is_const ::value is_const ::value is_const ::value     true    false    false    false    true    false    true  Note that a nonconstant pointer or reference to a constant type is not constant, whereas an ordinary array of constant elements is.22  Note that the traits checking for copy and move semantics only check whether the corresponding expressions are possible. For example, a type with a copy constructor with constant argument but no move constructor is still move constructible.  type traits are especially used to formulate noexcept speciﬁcations  see  The is_nothrow... Section 3.1.7, page 24 .  Traits for Type Relations  Table 5.15 lists the type traits that allow checking relations between types. This includes checking which constructors and assignment operators are provided for class types.

TraitstoCheckTypeRelations  22 Whether this is correct is currently an issue to decide in the core language group.   5.4 Type Traits and Type Utilities  129  Note that a type like int represents an lvalue or an rvalue. Because you can’t assign  42 = 77;  is_assignable  for a nonclass type as ﬁrst type always yields false_type. For class types, however, passing their ordinary type as ﬁrst type is ﬁne because there is a funny old rule that you can invoke member functions of rvalues of class types.23 For example:     false is_assignable ::value    true is_assignable ::value    false is_assignable ::value    true is_assignable ::value    false is_assignable ::value    false is_assignable ::value is_assignable ::value    false is_assignable ::value    true  Trait is_constructible  yields, for example, the following:     true is_constructible ::value    true is_constructible ::value    true is_constructible ::value    false is_constructible ::value    false is_constructible ::value    false is_constructible ::value    true is_constructible ::value is_constructible ::value    true  std::uses_allocator  is deﬁned in    see Section 19.1, page 1024 .  Type Modiﬁers  The traits listed in Table 5.16 allow you to modify types.  All modifying traits add a type property, provided it doesn’t exist yet, or remove a property  provided it exists already. For example, type int might only be extended:  typedef int T; add_const ::type add_lvalue_reference ::type add_rvalue_reference ::type add_pointer ::type make_signed ::type make_unsigned ::type remove_const ::type remove_reference ::type remove_pointer ::type     const int    int&    int&&    int*    int    unsigned int    int    int    int  23 Thanks to Daniel Krugler for pointing this out.  ¨   130  Chapter 5: Utilities  Effect Corresponding type without const Corresponding type without volatile Corresponding type without const and volatile Corresponding const type Corresponding volatile type Corresponding const volatile type Corresponding signed nonreference type Corresponding unsigned nonreference type Corresponding nonreference type  Trait remove_const  remove_volatile  remove_cv  add_const  add_volatile  add_cv  make_signed  make_unsigned  remove_reference  add_lvalue_reference  Corresponding lvalue reference type  rvalues become lvalues  add_rvalue_reference  Corresponding rvalue reference type  lvalues remain lvalues  remove_pointer  add_pointer   Referred type for pointers  same type otherwise  Type of pointer to corresponding nonreference type  Table5.16.

However, make_signed  and make_unsigned  require that the arguments be either integral or enumer- ation types, except bool, so passing references results in undeﬁned behavior.  Note that add_lvalue_reference  converts an rvalue reference into an lvalue reference, whereas add_rvalue_reference  does not convert an lvalue reference into an rvalue reference  the type remains as it was . Thus, to convert an lvalue into a rvalue reference, you have to call:  add_rvalue_reference ::type>::type  Other Type Traits  Table 5.17 lists all remaining type traits. They query special properties, check type relations, or provide more complicated type transformations.   5.4 Type Traits and Type Utilities  131  Trait rank  extent  remove_extent  remove_all_extents   underlying_type   decay  enable_if  conditional  common_type  result_of  alignment_of  aligned_storage  aligned_storage   aligned_union   Effect Number of dimensions of an array type  or 0  Extent of dimension I  or 0  Element types for arrays  same type otherwise  Element type for multidimensional arrays  same type otherwise  Underlying type of an enumeration type  see Section 3.1.13, page 32  Transfers to corresponding “by-value” type Yields type T only if bool B is true Yields type T if bool B is true and type F otherwise Common type of all passed types Type of calling F with argument types ArgTypes Equivalent to alignof T  Type of Len bytes with default alignment Type of Len bytes aligned according to a divisor of size_t Align Type of Len bytes aligned for a union of Types...

Thus, it converts array and function types into pointers as well as lvalues into rvalues, including removing const and volatile. See Section 5.1.1, page 65, for an example of its use.  As introduced in Section 5.4.1, page 124, common_type  provides a common type for all  passed types  may be one, two, or more type arguments .  5.4.3 Reference Wrappers  Class std::reference_wrapper , declared in  , is used primarily to “feed” refer- ences to function templates that take their parameter by value. For a given type T, this class provides ref   for an implicit conversion to T& and cref   for an implicit conversion to const T&, which usually allows function templates to work on references without specialization.  For example, after a declaration such as template   void foo  T val ;  by calling  int x; foo  std::ref x  ;  T becomes int&, whereas by calling  int x; foo  std::cref x  ;  T becomes const int&. This feature is used by the C++ standard library at various places. For example:   make_pair   uses this to be able to create a pair  of references  see Section 5.1.1, page 66 .   make_tuple   uses this to be able to create a tuple  of references  see Section 5.1.2, page 70 .   Binders use this to be able to bind references  see Section 10.2.2, page 491 .   Threads use this to pass arguments by reference  see Section 18.2.2, page 971 . Note also that class reference_wrapper allows you to use references as ﬁrst-class objects, such as element type in arrays or STL containers:  std::vector  coll; std::vector > coll;     Error    OK  See Section 7.11, page 391, for details.   5.4 Type Traits and Type Utilities  133  5.4.4 Function Type Wrappers  Class std::function , declared in  , provides polymorphic wrappers that gene- ralize the notion of a function pointer. This class allows you to use callable objects  functions, member functions, function objects, and lambdas; see Section 4.4, page 54  as ﬁrst-class objects.  For example: void func  int x, int y ;     initialize collections of tasks: std::vector > tasks; tasks.push_back func ; tasks.push_back []  int x, int y  {  ...  } ;     call each task: for  std::function  f : tasks  {  f 33,66 ;  }  };  class C { public:  void memfunc  int x, int y  const;  std::function  mf; mf = &C::memfunc; mf C  ,42,77 ;  When member functions are used, the object they are called for has to be the ﬁrst argument:  Another application of this is to declare functions that return lambdas  see Section 3.1.10, page 31 . Note that performing a function call without having a target to call throws an exception of type  std::bad_function_call  see Section 4.3.1, page 43 :  std::function  f; f 33,66 ;     throws std::bad_function_call   134  Chapter 5: Utilities  5.5 Auxiliary Functions  The C++ standard library provides some small auxiliary functions that process minimum and maxi- mum, swap values, or provide supplementary comparison operators.  5.5.1 Processing the Minimum and Maximum  Table 5.18 lists the utility functions   provides to process the minimum and or maxi- mum of two or more values. All minmax   functions and all function for initializer lists are provided since C++11.  Operation min a,b  min a,b,cmp  min initlist  min initlist,cmp  max a,b  max a,b,cmp  max initlist  max initlist,cmp  minmax a,b  minmax a,b,cmp  minmax initlist  minmax initlist,cmp  Returns the minimum and maximum of initlist comparing with cmp  Effect Returns the minimum of a and b, comparing with < Returns the minimum of a and b, comparing with cmp Returns the minimum in initlist, comparing with < Returns the minimum in initlist, comparing with cmp Returns the maximum of a and b, comparing with < Returns the maximum of a and b, comparing with cmp Returns the maximum in initlist, comparing with < Returns the maximum in initlist, comparing with cmp Returns the minimum and maximum of a and b, comparing with < Returns the minimum and maximum of a and b, comparing with cmp Returns the minimum and maximum of initlist comparing with <  Table5.18. OperationstoProcessMinimumandMaximum  The function minmax   returns a pair   see Section 5.1.1, page 60 , where the ﬁrst value is  the minimum, and the second value is the maximum.  For the versions with two arguments, min   and max   return the ﬁrst element if both values are equal. For initializer lists, min   and max   return the ﬁrst of multiple minimum or maximum elements. minmax   returns the pair of a and b for two equal arguments and the ﬁrst minimum but the last maximum element for an initializer list. However, it is probably a good programming style not to rely on this.  Note that the versions taking two values return a reference; the versions taking initializer lists  return copies of the values:  namespace std {  template    const T& min  const T& a, const T& b ;  template    T min  initializer_list  initlist ;  ...  }   5.5 Auxiliary Functions  135  The reason is that for an initializer list, you need an internal temporary, so returning a reference would return a dangling reference.  Both functions are also provided with the comparison criterion as an additional argument: namespace std {  template    const T& min  const T& a, const T& b, Compare cmp ;  template    T min  initializer_list  initlist, Compare cmp ;  The comparison argument might be a function or a function object  see Section 6.10, page 233  that compares both arguments and returns whether the ﬁrst is less than the second in some particular order.  The following example shows how to use the maximum function by passing a special comparison     function that compares two pointers by comparing the values to which they point bool int_ptr_less  int* a, int* b  {  ...  }  function as an argument:     util minmax1.cpp  include    return *a < *b;  }  int main   {  int x = 17; int y = 42; int z = 33; int* px = &x; int* py = &y; int* pz = &z;     call max   with special comparison function int* pmax = std::max  px, py, int_ptr_less ;     call minmax   for initializer list with special comparison function std::pair  extremes = std::minmax  {px, py, pz}, int_ptr_less ;  ...  }   136  Chapter 5: Utilities  Alternatively, you could use new language features, such as a lambda, to specify the comparison criterion and auto to avoid the explicit declaration of the return value:  auto extremes = std::minmax  {px, py, pz}, [] int*a, int*b  {  return *a < *b;  } ;  Note that the deﬁnitions of min   and max   require that both types match. Thus, you can’t call them for objects of different types:  int i; long l; ... std::max i,l ; std::max {i,l} ;  However, you could qualify explicitly the type of your template arguments  and thus the return type :     ERROR: argument types don’t match    ERROR: argument types don’t match  The function swap   is provided to swap the values of two objects. The general implementation of swap   is deﬁned in   as follows:24  std::max  i,l ; std::max  {i,l} ;     OK    OK  5.5.2 Swapping Two Values  namespace std {  template   inline void swap T& a, T& b  ... {  T tmp std::move a  ; a = std::move b ; b = std::move tmp ;  }  }  Thus, internally, the values are moved or move assigned  see Section 3.1.5, page 19, for details of move semantics . Before C++11, the values were assigned or copied.  By using this function, you can have two arbitrary variables x and y swap their values by calling std::swap x,y ;  Of course, this call is possible only if move or copy semantics are provided by the parameter type.  Note that swap   provides an exception speciﬁcation  that’s why ...  is used in the previous  declarations . The exception speciﬁcation for the general swap   is:25  24 Before C++11, swap   was deﬁned in  . 25 See Section 3.1.7, page 24, for details about noexcept and Section 5.4.2, page 127, for the type traits used here.   5.5 Auxiliary Functions  137  noexcept is_nothrow_move_constructible ::value &&  is_nothrow_move_assignable ::value   Since C++11, the C++ standard library also provides an overload for arrays:  namespace std {  template   void swap  T  &a [N], T  &b [N]   noexcept noexcept swap *a,*b   ;  The big advantage of using swap   is that it enables you to provide special implementations for more complex types by using template specialization or function overloading. These special imple- mentations might save time by swapping internal members rather than by assigning the objects. This is the case, for example, for all standard containers  see Section 7.1.2, page 258  and strings  see Section 13.2.8, page 674 . For example, a swap   implementation for a simple container that has only an array and the number of elements as members could look like this:  class MyContainer {  private:  int* elems; int  numElems;     dynamic array of elements    number of elements  public:  ...    implementation of swap   void swap MyContainer& x  {  std::swap elems,x.elems ; std::swap numElems,x.numElems ;     overloaded global swap   for this type inline void swap  MyContainer& c1, MyContainer& c2   noexcept noexcept c1.swap c2     c1.swap c2 ;     calls implementation of swap    So, calling swap   instead of swapping the values directly might result in substantial performance improvements. You should always offer a specialization of swap   for your own types if doing so has performance advantages.  Note that both types have to match: int i; long l; std::swap i,l ;     ERROR: argument types don’t match  }  {  }  } ...  };   138  Chapter 5: Utilities  int a1[10]; int a3[11]; std::swap a1,a3 ;     ERROR: arrays have different types  different sizes   5.5.3 Supplementary Comparison Operators  Four function templates deﬁne the comparison operators !=, >,  = by calling the operators == and   and are usually deﬁned as follows:  namespace std {  namespace rel_ops {  template   inline bool operator!=  const T& x, const T& y  {  return ! x == y ;  } template   inline bool operator>  const T& x, const T& y  {  return y < x;  } template   inline bool operator<=  const T& x, const T& y  {  return ! y < x ;  } template   inline bool operator>=  const T& x, const T& y  {  return ! x < y ;  To use these functions, you need only deﬁne operators < and ==. Using namespace std::rel_ops deﬁnes the other comparison operators automatically. For example:  include    }  }  }  class X { public:  };  bool operator==  const X& x  const; bool operator<  const X& x  const; ...   5.5 Auxiliary Functions  139  void foo   {  using namespace std::rel_ops; X x1, x2; ... if  x1 != x2  {     OK  } if  x1 > x2  {     OK     make !=, >, etc., available  These operators are deﬁned in a subnamespace of std, called rel_ops. They are in a separate namespace so that user-deﬁned relational operators in the global namespace won’t clash even if all identiﬁers of namespace std become global by using a general using directive:  using namespace std;     operators are not in global scope  On the other hand, users who want to get their hands on them explicitly can implement the following without having to rely on lookup rules to ﬁnd them implicitly:  using namespace std::rel_ops;     operators are in global scope  Some implementations deﬁne the operators by using two different argument types:  namespace std {  namespace rel_ops {  template   inline bool operator!= const T1& x, const T2& y  {  return ! x == y ;  ...  ...  } ...  }  }  }  }  The advantage of such an implementation is that the types of the operands may differ, provided the types are comparable. But note that this kind of implementation is not provided by the C++ standard library. Thus, taking advantage of it makes code nonportable.   140  Chapter 5: Utilities  5.6 Compile-Time Fractional Arithmetic with  Class ratio   Since C++11, the C++ standard library provides an interface to specify compile-time fractions and to perform compile-time arithmetic with them. To quote [N2661:Chrono]  with minor modiﬁca- tions :26  The ratio utility is a general purpose utility inspired by Walter E. Brown allowing one to easily and safely compute rational values at compile time. The ratio class catches all errors  such as divide by zero and overﬂow  at compile time. It is used in the duration and time_point libraries [see Section 5.7, page 143] to efﬁciently create units of time. It can also be used in other “quantity” libraries  both standard-deﬁned and user-deﬁned , or anywhere there is a rational constant which is known at compile time. The use of this utility can greatly reduce the chances of runtime overﬂow because a ratio and any ratios resulting from ratio arithmetic are always reduced to lowest terms.  The ratio utility is provided in  , with class ratio  deﬁned as follows:  namespace std {  template   class ratio {  public:  typedef ratio  type; static constexpr intmax_t num; static constexpr intmax_t den;  };  }     util ratio1.cpp  include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {  intmax_t designates a signed integer type capable of representing any value of any signed integer type. It is deﬁned in   or   with at least 64 bits. Numerator and denominator are both public and are automatically reduced to the lowest terms. For example:  typedef ratio  FiveThirds; cout << FiveThirds::num << " " << FiveThirds::den << endl;  26 Thanks to Walter E.

The four basic arithmetic compile-time operations +, -, *, and   are deﬁned as ratio_add, ratio_subtract, ratio_multiply, and ratio_divide. The resulting type is a ratio , so the static member type yields the corresponding type. For example, the following expression yields std::ratio   computed as 6  21 + 7  21  :  std::ratio_add ,std::ratio >::type  Meaning Operation Reduced sum of ratios ratio_add Reduced difference of ratios ratio_subtract Reduced product of ratios ratio_multiply Reduced quotient of ratios ratio_divide Checks for == ratio_equal Checks for != ratio_not_equal Checks for < ratio_less Checks for <= ratio_less_equal Checks for > ratio_greater ratio_greater_equal Checks for >=  Result ratio  ratio  ratio  ratio  true_type or false_type true_type or false_type true_type or false_type true_type or false_type true_type or false_type true_type or false_type  Table5.19. Operationsofratio  Types   142  Chapter 5: Utilities  In addition, you can compare two ratio types with ratio_equal, ratio_not_equal, ratio_less, ratio_less_equal, ratio_greater, or ratio_greater_equal. As with type traits, the resulting type is derived from true_type or false_type  see Section 5.4.2, page 125 , so its member value yields true or false:  ratio_equal ,ratio >::value     yields true  As written, class ratio catches all errors, such as divide by zero and overﬂow, at compile time. For example,  ratio_multiply ::max  >,  ratio >::type max times 1 won’t compile, because nator exceeding the limit of its type.  1  2 results in an overﬂow, with the resulting value of the denomi-  Similarly, the following expression won’t compile, because this is a division by zero: ratio_divide ::type  Note, however, that the following expression will compile because the invalid value is detected when member type, num, or den are evaluated: ratio_divide   1  1,000  1  1  Name Unit yocto zepto atto femto pico nano micro milli centi deci deca hecto kilo mega giga tera peta exa zetta yotta  1  1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000  optional  1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000  optional   1  1,000,000,000,000,000,000  1  1  1,000,000,000,000,000  1,000,000,000,000  1  1  1,000,000,000  1,000,000  100 1 10 10 100 1, 000 1, 000, 000 1, 000, 000, 000 1, 000, 000, 000, 000 1, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000 1, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000 1, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000  optional  1, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000  optional   Table5.20. Predeﬁned ratio Units   5.7 Clocks and Timers  143  Predeﬁned ratios make it more convenient to specify large or very small numbers  see Table 5.20 . They allow you to specify large numbers without the inconvenient and error-prone listing of zeros. For example,  std::nano is equivalent to  std::ratio   which makes it more convenient to specify, for example, nanoseconds  see Section 5.7.2, page 145 . The units marked as “optional” are deﬁned only if they are representable by intmax_t.  5.7 Clocks and Timers  One of the most obvious libraries a programming language should have is one to deal with date and time. However, experience shows that such a library is harder to design than it sounds. The problem is the amount of ﬂexibility and precision the library should provide. In fact, in the past, the interfaces to system time provided by C and POSIX switched from seconds to milliseconds, then to microseconds, and ﬁnally to nanoseconds. The problem was that for each switch, a new interface was provided. For this reason, a precision-neutral library was proposed for C++11. This library is usually called the chrono library because its features are deﬁned in  .  In addition, the C++ standard library provides the basic C and POSIX interfaces to deal with calendar time. Finally, you can use the thread library, provided since C++11, to wait for a thread or the program  the main thread  for a period of time.  5.7.1 Overview of the Chrono Library  The chrono library was designed to be able to deal with the fact that timers and clocks might be different on different systems and improve over time in precision. To avoid having to introduce a new time type every 10 years or so — as happened with the POSIX time libraries, for example — the goal was to provide a precision-neutral concept by separating duration and point of time  “timepoint”  from speciﬁc clocks. As a result, the core of the chrono library consists of the following types or concepts, which serve as abstract mechanisms to specify and deal with points in and durations of time:   A duration of time is deﬁned as a speciﬁc number of ticks over a time unit. One example is a duration such as “3 minutes”  3 ticks of a “minute” . Other examples are “42 milliseconds” or “86,400 seconds,” which represents the duration of 1 day. This concept also allows specifying something like “1.5 times a third of a second,” where 1.5 is the number of ticks and “a third of a second” the time unit used.   A timepoint is deﬁned as combination of a duration and a beginning of time  the so-called epoch . A typical example is a timepoint that represents “New Year’s Midnight 2000,” which is described as “1,262,300,400 seconds since January 1, 1970”  this day is the epoch of the system clock of UNIX and POSIX systems .   144  Chapter 5: Utilities    The concept of a timepoint, however, is parametrized by a clock, which is the object that deﬁnes the epoch of a timepoint. Thus, different clocks have different epochs. In general, operations dealing with multiple timepoints, such as processing the duration difference between two time- points, require using the same epoch clock. A clock also provides a convenience function to yield the timepoint of now.  In other words, timepoint is deﬁned as a duration before or after an epoch, which is deﬁned by a clock  see Figure 5.4 .  epoch  of a clock   timepoint   duration   timepoint   duration   duration   duration   timepoint   Figure5.4. Epoch,Durations,andTimepoints  For more details about the motivation and design of these classes, see [N2661:Chrono].27 Let’s  look into these types and concepts in detail.  Note that all identiﬁers of the chrono library are deﬁned in namespace std::chrono.  5.7.2 Durations  A duration is a combination of a value representing the number of ticks and a fraction representing the unit in seconds. Class ratio is used to specify the fraction  see Section 5.6, page 140 . For example:  std::chrono::duration  std::chrono::duration > std::chrono::duration > oneMillisecond 1 ;  twentySeconds 20 ; halfAMinute 0.5 ;  Here, the ﬁrst template argument deﬁnes the type of the ticks, and the optional second template argument deﬁnes the unit type in seconds. Thus, the ﬁrst line uses seconds as unit type, the second line uses minutes  “ 60  1000 of a second” . For more convenience, the C++ standard library provides the following type deﬁnitions:  1 seconds” , and the third line uses milliseconds  “ 1  27 I use some quotes of [N2661:Chrono] in this book with friendly permission by the authors.   5.7 Clocks and Timers  145  namespace std {  namespace chrono {  typedef duration = 64 bits,nano> typedef duration = 55 bits,micro> typedef duration = 45 bits,milli> typedef duration = 35 bits> typedef duration = 29 bits,ratio > typedef duration = 23 bits,ratio > hours;  nanoseconds; microseconds; milliseconds; seconds; minutes;  }  }  With them, you can easily specify typical time periods:  std::chrono::seconds std::chrono::hours std::chrono::milliseconds oneMillisecond 1 ;  twentySeconds 20 ; aDay 24 ;  Arithmetic Duration Operations  You can compute with durations in the expected way  see Table 5.21 :   You can process the sum, difference, product, or quotient of two durations.   You can add or subtract ticks or other durations.   You can compare two durations. The important point here is that the unit type of two durations involved in such an operation might be different. Due to a provided overloading of common_type   see Section 5.4.1, page 124  for durations, the resulting duration will have a unit that is the greatest common divisor of the units of both operands.  For example, after d1 42 ; chrono::seconds chrono::milliseconds d2 10 ;     42 seconds    10 milliseconds  the expression  d1 - d2  yields a duration of 41,990 ticks of unit type milliseconds   1  1000 seconds .  Or, more generally, after chrono::duration > d1 1 ; chrono::duration > d2 1 ;     1 tick of 1 3 second    1 tick of 1 5 second  the expression  d1 + d2  yields 8 ticks of 1  15 second and  d1 < d2  yields false. In both cases, d1 gets expanded to 5 ticks of 1 ticks of 1  15 second. So the sum of 3 and 5 is 8, and 5 is not less than 3.  15 second, and d2 gets expanded to 3   146  Chapter 5: Utilities  Operation Effect d1 + d2 d1 - d2 d * val val * d d   val d1   d2 d % val d % d2 d1 == d2 d1 != d2 d1 < d2 d1 <= d2 d1 > d2 d1 <= d2 ++d d++ --d d-- d += d1 d -= d1 d *= val d  = val d %= val d %= d2  Process sum of durations d1 and d2 Process difference of durations d1 and d2 Return result of val times duration d Return result of val times duration d Return of the duration d divided by value val Compute factor between durations d1 and d2 Result of duration d modulo value val Result of duration d modulo the value of d2 Return whether duration d1 is equal to duration d2 Return whether duration d1 differs from duration d2 Return whether duration d1 is shorter than duration d2 Return whether duration d1 is not longer than duration d2 Return whether duration d1 is longer than duration d2 Return whether duration d1 is not shorter than duration d2 Increment duration d by 1 tick Increment duration d by 1 tick Decrement duration d by 1 tick Decrement duration d by 1 tick Extend the duration d by the duration d1 Shorten the duration d by the duration d1 Multiply the duration d by val Divide the duration d by val Process duration d modulo val Process duration d modulo the value of d2  Table5.21. ArithmeticOperationsof durations  You can also convert durations into durations of different units, as long as there is an implicit type conversion. Thus, you can convert hours into seconds but not the other way around. For example:  std::chrono::seconds twentySeconds 20 ; std::chrono::hours  aDay 24 ;     20 seconds    24 hours  std::chrono::milliseconds ms; ms += twentySeconds + aDay; --ms; ms *= 2; std::cout << ms.count   << " ms" << std::endl; std::cout << std::chrono::nanoseconds ms .count   << " ns" << std::endl;     0 milliseconds    86,400,000 milliseconds    86,399,999 milliseconds    172,839,998 milliseconds  These conversions result in the following output:  172839998 ms 172839998000000 ns   5.7 Clocks and Timers  Other Duration Operations  147  In the preceding example, we use the member count   to yield the current number of ticks, which is one of the other operations provided for durations. Table 5.22 lists all operations, members, and types available for durations besides the arithmetic operations of Table 5.21. Note that the default constructor default-initializes  see Section 3.2.1, page 37  its value, which means that for fundamental representation types, the initial value is undeﬁned.

OtherOperationsandTypesofdurations  You can use these members to deﬁne a convenience function for the output operator << for  durations:28  template   ostream& operator  & d  {  s << "[" << d.count   << " of " << R::num << " "  << R::den << "]";  return s;  }  Here, after printing the number of ticks with count  , we print the numerator and denominator of the unit type used, which is a ratio processed at compile time  see Section 5.6, page 140 . For example,  std::chrono::milliseconds d 42 ; std::cout << d << std::endl;  will then print:  [42 of 1 1000]  28 Note that this output operator does not work where ADL  argument-dependent lookup  does not work  see Section 15.11.1, page 812, for details .   148  Chapter 5: Utilities  As we have seen, implicit conversions to a more precise unit type are always possible. However, conversions to a coarser unit type are not, because you might lose information. For example, when converting an integral value of 42,010 milliseconds into seconds, the resulting integral value, 42, means that the precision of having a duration of 10 milliseconds over 42 seconds gets lost. But you can still explicitly force such a conversion with a duration_cast. For example:  std::chrono::seconds sec 55 ; std::chrono::minutes m1 = sec; std::chrono::minutes m2 =     ERROR  std::chrono::duration_cast  sec ;     OK  As another example, converting a duration with a ﬂoating-point tick type also requires an explicit cast to convert it into an integral duration type:  std::chrono::duration > halfMin 0.5 ; std::chrono::seconds s1 = halfMin; std::chrono::seconds s2 =     ERROR  std::chrono::duration_cast  halfMin ;     OK  A typical example is code that segments a duration into different units. For example, the follow- ing code segments a duration of milliseconds into the corresponding hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds  to output the ﬁrst line starting with raw: we use the output operator just deﬁned :  using namespace std; using namespace std::chrono; milliseconds ms 7255042 ;  hh = duration_cast  ms ;     split into hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds hours minutes mm = duration_cast  ms % chrono::hours 1  ; seconds ss = duration_cast  ms % chrono::minutes 1  ; milliseconds msec  = duration_cast  ms % chrono::seconds 1  ;     and print durations and values: cout << "raw: " << hh << "::" << mm << "::"  << ss << "::" << msec << endl;  cout << "  " << setfill ’0’  << setw 2  << hh.count   << "::" << setw 2  << mm.count   << "::" << setw 2  << ss.count   << "::" << setw 3  << msec.count   << endl;  Here, the cast  std::chrono::duration_cast  ms   converts the milliseconds into hours, where the values are truncated, not rounded. Thanks to the modulo operator %, for which you can even pass a duration as second argument, you can easily   5.7 Clocks and Timers  149  process the remaining milliseconds with ms % std::chrono::hours 1 , which is then converted into minutes. Thus, the output of this code will be as follows:  raw: [2 of 3600 1]::[0 of 60 1]::[55 of 1 1]::[42 of 1 1000]  02::00::55::042  Finally, class duration provides three static functions: zero  , which yields a duration of 0 sec- onds, as well as min   and max  , which yield the minimum and maximum value a duration can have.  5.7.3 Clocks and Timepoints  The relationships between timepoints and clocks are a bit tricky:   A clock deﬁnes an epoch and a tick period. For example, a clock might tick in milliseconds since the UNIX epoch  January 1, 1970  or tick in nanoseconds since the start of the program. In addition, a clock provides a type for any timepoint speciﬁed according to this clock.  time.  The interface of a clock provides a function now   to yield an object for the current point in   A timepoint represents a speciﬁc point in time by associating a positive or negative duration to a given clock. Thus, if the duration is “10 days” and the associated clock has the epoch of January 1, 1970, the timepoint represents January 11, 1970.  The interface of a timepoint provides the ability to yield the epoch, minimum and maximum  timepoints according to the clock, and timepoint arithmetic.  Clocks  Table 5.23 lists the type deﬁnitions and static members required for each clock.  Operation clock::duration clock::rep  clock::period  Effect Yields the duration type of the clock Yields the type of the ticks  equivalent to clock::duration::rep  Yields the type of the unit type  equivalent to clock::duration::period   clock::time_point Yields the timepoint type of the clock clock::is_steady clock::now    Yields true if the clock is steady Yields a time_point for the current point in time  Table5.23. OperationsandTypesofClocks  The C++ standard library provides three clocks, which provide this interface: 1. The system_clock represents timepoints associated with the usual real-time clock of the cur- rent system. This clock also provides convenience functions to_time_t   and from_time_t     150  Chapter 5: Utilities  to convert between any timepoint and the C system time type time_t, which means that you can convert into and from calendar times  see Section 5.7.4, page 158 .  2. The steady_clock gives the guarantee that it never gets adjusted.29 Thus, timepoint values never decrease as the physical time advances, and they advance at a steady rate relative to real time.  3. The high_resolution_clock represents a clock with the shortest tick period possible on  the current system.  Note that the standard does not provide requirements for the precision, the epoch, and the range  minimum and maximum timepoints  of these clocks. For example, your system clock might have the UNIX epoch  January 1, 1970  as epoch, but this is not guaranteed. If you require a speciﬁc epoch or care for timepoints that might not be covered by the clock, you have to use convenience functions to ﬁnd it out.  For example, the following function prints the properties of a clock:     util clock.hpp  include   include   include    template   void printClockData    {  using namespace std;  cout << "- precision: ";    if time unit is less or equal one millisecond typedef typename C::period P; if  ratio_less_equal ::value  {     type of time unit     convert to and print as milliseconds typedef typename ratio_multiply ::type TT; cout << fixed << double TT::num  TT::den  << " milliseconds" << endl;  } else {  }     print as seconds cout << fixed << double P::num  P::den << " seconds" << endl;  } cout << "- is_steady: " << boolalpha << C::is_steady << endl;  We can call this function for the various clocks provided by the C++ standard library:  29 The steady_clock was initially proposed as monotonic_clock.   5.7 Clocks and Timers  151     util clock1.cpp  include   include "clock.hpp"  int main   {  std::cout << "system_clock: " << std::endl; printClockData   ; std::cout << "\nhigh_resolution_clock: " << std::endl; printClockData   ; std::cout << "\nsteady_clock: " << std::endl; printClockData   ;  }  The program might, for example, have the following output:  system_clock: - precision: 0.000100 milliseconds - is_steady: false  high_resolution_clock: - precision: 0.000100 milliseconds - is_steady: true  steady_clock: - precision: 1.000000 milliseconds - is_steady: true  Here, for example, the system and the high-resolution clock have the same precision of 100 nanosec- onds, whereas the steady clock uses milliseconds. You can also see that both the steady clock and high-resolution clock can’t be adjusted. Note, however, that this might be very different on other systems. For example, the high-resolution clock might be the same as the system clock.  The steady_clock is important to compare or compute the difference of two times in your  program, where you processed the current point in time. For example, after  auto system_start = chrono::system_clock::now  ;  a condition to check whether the program runs more than one minute:  if  chrono::system_clock::now   > system_start + minutes 1    might not work, because if the clock was adjusted in the meantime, the comparison might yield false, although the program did run more than a minute. Similarly, processing the elapsed time of a program:  auto diff = chrono::system_clock::now   - system_start; auto sec = chrono::duration_cast  diff ; cout << "this program runs: " << s.count   << " seconds" << endl;   152  Chapter 5: Utilities  might print a negative duration if the clock was adjusted in the meantime. For the same reason, using timers with other than the steady_clock might change their duration when the system clock gets adjusted  see Section 5.7.5, page 160, for details .  With any of these clocks — or even with user-deﬁned clocks — you can deal with timepoints. Class time_point provides the corresponding interface, parametrized by a clock:  namespace std {  namespace chrono {  template <typename Clock,  typename Duration = typename Clock::duration>  class time_point;  Timepoints  }  }  Four speciﬁc timepoints play a special role: 1. The epoch, which the default constructor of class time_point yields for each clock. 2. The current time, which the static member function now   of each clock yields  see Sec-  3. The minimum timepoint, which the static member function min   of class time_point yields  4. The maximum timepoint, which the static member function max   of class time_point yields  For example, the following program assigns these timepoints to tp and prints them converted into a calendar notation:  std::string asString  const std::chrono::system_clock::time_point& tp  {     convert to system time: std::time_t t = std::chrono::system_clock::to_time_t tp ;    convert to calendar time std::string ts = std::ctime &t ;    skip trailing newline ts.resize ts.size  -1 ; return ts;  tion 5.7.3, page 149 .  for each clock.  for each clock.     util chrono1.cpp  include   include   include   include    }  int main   {   5.7 Clocks and Timers  153     print the epoch of this system clock: std::chrono::system_clock::time_point tp; std::cout << "epoch: " << asString tp  << std::endl;     print current time: tp = std::chrono::system_clock::now  ; std::cout << "now:  " << asString tp  << std::endl;     print minimum time of this system clock: tp = std::chrono::system_clock::time_point::min  ; std::cout << "min:  " << asString tp  << std::endl;     print maximum time of this system clock: tp = std::chrono::system_clock::time_point::max  ; std::cout << "max:  " << asString tp  << std::endl;  }  After including  , we ﬁrst declare a convenience function asString  , which converts a timepoint of the system clock into the corresponding calendar time. With  std::time_t t = std::chrono::system_clock::to_time_t tp ;  we use the static convenience function to_time_t  , which converts a timepoint into an object of the traditional time type of C and POSIX, type time_t, which usually represents the number of seconds since the UNIX epoch, January 1, 1970  see Section 5.7.4, page 157 . Then,  std::string ts = std::ctime &t ;  uses ctime   to convert this into a calendar notation, for which  ts.resize ts.size  -1 ;  removes the trailing newline character.  Note that ctime   takes the local time zone into account, which has consequences we will dis- cuss shortly. Note also that this convenience function probably will work only for system_clocks, the only clocks that provide an interface for conversions to and from time_t. For other clocks, such an interface might also work but is not portable, because the other clocks are not required to have epoch of the system time as their internal epoch.  Note also that the output format for timepoints might better get localized by using the time_put  facet. See Section 16.4.3, page 884, for details, and page 886 for an example.  Inside main  , the type of tp, declared as std::chrono::system_clock::time_point  is equivalent to:30  std::chrono::time_point   30 According to time_point , where C2 is a different clock but has the same epoch as system_clock.  a system_clock::time_point could  standard,  identical  also  the  be  to   154  Chapter 5: Utilities  Thus, tp is declared as the timepoint of the system_clock. Having the clock as template argument ensures that only timepoint arithmetic with the same clock  epoch  is possible.  The program might have the following output: epoch: Thu Jan now: min: max:  1 01:00:00 1970 Sun Jul 24 19:40:46 2011 Sat Mar 5 18:27:38 1904 Mon Oct 29 07:32:22 2035  Thus, the default constructor, which yields the epoch, creates a timepoint, which asString   con- verts into  Thu Jan  1 01:00:00 1970  Note that it’s 1 o’clock rather than midnight. This may look a bit surprising, but remember that the conversion to the calendar time with ctime   inside asString   takes the time zone into account. Thus, the UNIX epoch used here — which, again, is not always guaranteed to be the epoch of the system time — started at 00:00 in Greenwich, UK. In my time zone, Germany, it was 1 a.m. at that moment, so in my time zone the epoch started at 1 a.m. on January 1, 1970. Accordingly, if you start this program, your output is probably different, according to your time zone, even if your system uses the same epoch in its system clock.  To have the universal time  UTC  instead, you should use the following conversion rather than calling ctime  , which is a shortcut for asctime localtime ...    see Section 5.7.4, page 157 :  std::string ts = std::asctime gmtime &t  ;  In that case, the output of the program would be:  epoch: Thu Jan now: min: max:  1 00:00:00 1970 Sun Jul 24 17:40:46 2011 Sat Mar 5 17:27:38 1904 Mon Oct 29 06:32:22 2035  Yes, here, the difference is 2 hours for now  , because this timepoint is when summertime is used, which leads to a 2-hour difference to UTC in Germany.  In general, time_point objects have only one member, the duration, which is relative to the epoch of the associated clock. The timepoint value can be requested by time_since_epoch  . For timepoint arithmetic, any useful combination of a timepoint and another timepoint or duration is provided  see Table 5.24 .  Although the interface uses class ratio  see Section 5.6, page 140 , which ensures that over- ﬂows by the duration units yield a compile-time error, overﬂows on the duration values are possible. Consider the following example:     util chrono2.cpp  include   include   include   include   using namespace std;   5.7 Clocks and Timers  Operation timepoint t  Yields timepoint Default constructor; creates a timepoint  Effect  representing the epoch  timepoint t tp2   timepoint Creates a timepoint equivalent to tp2  the  duration unit might be ﬁner grained   timepoint t d   timepoint Creates a timepoint having duration d after  the epoch  time_point_cast  tp   timepoint Converts tp into a timepoint with clock C and  155  tp += d tp -= d  tp + d  d + tp  tp - d  tp1 - tp2  tp1 == tp2  tp1 != tp2  tp1 < tp2  tp1 <= tp2  tp1 > tp2  tp1 >= tp2  duration D  which might be more coarse grained   timepoint Adds duration d to the current timepoint tp timepoint  Subtracts duration d from the current timepoint tp  timepoint Returns a new timepoint of tp with duration d  timepoint Returns a new timepoint of tp with duration d  added  added  timepoint Returns a new timepoint of tp with duration d  duration  bool  bool  bool  bool  bool  bool  subtracted Returns the duration between timepoints tp1 and tp2 Returns whether timepoint tp1 is equal to timepoint tp2 Returns whether timepoint tp1 differs from timepoint tp2 Returns whether timepoint tp1 is before timepoint tp2 Returns whether timepoint tp1 is not after timepoint tp2 Returns whether timepoint tp1 is after timepoint tp2 Returns whether timepoint tp1 is not before timepoint tp2 Returns the duration between the epoch and timepoint tp  tp.time_since_epoch    duration  timepoint::min    timepoint Returns the ﬁrst possible timepoint of type  timepoint::max    timepoint Returns the last possible timepoint of type  timepoint  timepoint  Table5.24.

Because the precision of the system clock usually is better than minutes and days, you have to  explicitly cast the difference between two timepoints to become days:  auto diff = tp - chrono::system_clock::time_point  ; Days days = chrono::duration_cast  diff ;  Note, however, that these operation do not check whether a combination performs an overﬂow. On my system, the output of the program is as follows:  1 01:00:00 1970 3 00:55:00 1970  Thu Jan Sat Jan 2875 minute s  1 day s  Fri Jan  epoch: later: diff: diff: -1 year: 3 00:55:00 1969 -50 years: Thu Jan 16 00:55:00 1919 -50 years: Sat Mar 5 07:23:16 2005 You can see the following:   The cast uses static_cast  for the destination unit, which for ordinary integral unit types means that values are truncated instead of rounded. For this reason, a duration of 47 hours and 55 minutes converts into 1 day.   Subtracting 50 years of 365 days does not take leap years into account, so the resulting day is   When deducting another 50 years the timepoint goes below the minimum timepoint, which is March 5, 1904 on my system  see Section 5.7.3, page 152 , so the result is the year 2005. No error processing is required by the C++ standard library in this case.  January 16 instead of January 3.  This demonstrates that chrono is a duration and a timepoint but not a date time library. You can com- pute with durations and timepoints but still have to take epoch, minimum and maximum timepoints, leap years, and leap seconds into account.  5.7.4 Date and Time Functions by C and POSIX  The C++ standard library also provides the standard C and POSIX interfaces to deal with date and time. In  , the macros, types, and functions of   are available in namespace std. The types and functions are listed in Table 5.25. In addition, the macro CLOCKS_PER_SEC deﬁnes CLOCKS P ER SEC seconds . the unit type of clock    which returns the elapsed CPU time in See Section 16.4.3, page 884, for some more details and examples using these time functions and types.  1   158  Chapter 5: Utilities  Meaning Type of numeric values of elapsed CPU time returned by clock   Type of numeric values representing timepoints Type of “broken down” calendar time Yields the elapsed CPU time in Yields the current time as numeric value Yields the difference of two time_t in seconds as double  Identiﬁer clock_t time_t struct tm clock   time   difftime   localtime   Converts a time_t into a struct tm taking time zone into account gmtime   asctime   strftime   ctime    Converts a time_t into a struct tm not taking time zone into account Converts a struct tm into a standard calendar time string Converts a struct tm into a user-deﬁned calendar time string Converts a time_t into a standard calendar time string taking time zone into account  shortcut for asctime localtime t    Converts a struct tm into a time_t and queries weekday and day of the year  CLOCKS P ER SEC seconds  mktime    1  Table5.25. Deﬁnitionsin    Note that time_t usually is just the number of seconds since the UNIX epoch, which is January 1, 1970. However, according to the C and C++ standard, this is not guaranteed.  Conversions between Timepoints and Calendar Time  The convenience function to transfer a timepoint to a calendar time string was already discussed in Section 5.7.3, page 153. Here is a header ﬁle that also allows converting calendar times into timepoints:     util timepoint.hpp  include   include   include       convert timepoint of system clock to calendar time string inline std::string asString  const std::chrono::system_clock::time_point& tp  {     convert to system time: std::time_t t = std::chrono::system_clock::to_time_t tp ; std::string ts = ctime &t ; ts.resize ts.size  -1 ; return ts;     convert to calendar time    skip trailing newline  }   5.7 Clocks and Timers  159     convert calendar time to timepoint of system clock inline std::chrono::system_clock::time_point makeTimePoint  int year, int mon, int day,  int hour, int min, int sec=0   struct std::tm t; t.tm_sec = sec; t.tm_min = min; t.tm_hour = hour; t.tm_mday = day; t.tm_mon = mon-1; t.tm_year = year-1900;    year since 1900 t.tm_isdst = -1; std::time_t tt = std::mktime &t ; if  tt == -1  {  throw "no valid system time";     second of minute  0 .. 59 and 60 for leap seconds     minute of hour  0 .. 59     hour of day  0 .. 23     day of month  0 .. 31     month of year  0 .. 11      determine whether daylight saving time  } return std::chrono::system_clock::from_time_t tt ;  The following program demonstrates these convenience functions:     util timepoint1.cpp  include   include   include "timepoint.hpp"  int main   {  auto tp1 = makeTimePoint 2010,01,01,00,00 ; std::cout << asString tp1  << std::endl;  auto tp2 = makeTimePoint 2011,05,23,13,44 ; std::cout << asString tp2  << std::endl;  The program has the following output:  Fri Jan 1 00:00:00 2010 Mon May 23 13:44:00 2011  Note again that both makeTimePoint   and asString   take the local time zone into account. For this reason, the date passed to makeTimePoint   matches the output with asString  . Also, it doesn’t matter whether daylight saving time is used  passing a negative value to t.tm_isdst in  {  }  }   160  Chapter 5: Utilities  makeTimePoint   causes mktime   to attempt to determine whether daylight saving time is in effect for the speciﬁed time .  Again, to let asString   use the universal time UTC instead, use asctime gmtime ...   rather than ctime ... . For mktime  , there is no speciﬁed way to use UTC, so makeTimePoint   always takes the current time zone into account.  Section 16.4.3, page 884, demonstrates how to use locales to internationalize the reading and  writing of time data.  5.7.5 Blocking with Timers  Durations and timepoints can be used to block threads or programs  i.e., the main thread . These blocks can be conditionless or can be used to specify a maximum duration when waiting for a lock, a condition variable, or another thread to end  see Chapter 18 :   sleep_for   and sleep_until   are provided by this_thread to block threads  see Sec-   try_lock_for   and try_lock_until   are provided to specify a maximum interval when   wait_for   and wait_until   are provided to specify a maximum interval when waiting for  waiting for a mutex  see Section 18.5.1, page 994 .  tion 18.3.7, page 981 .  a condition variable or a future  see Section 18.1.1, page 953 or Section 18.6.4, page 1010 .  All the blocking functions that end with ..._for   use a duration, whereas all functions that end with ..._until   use a timepoint as argument. For example,  this_thread::sleep_for chrono::seconds 10  ;  blocks the current thread, which might be the main thread, for 10 seconds, whereas  this_thread::sleep_until chrono::system_clock::now    + chrono::seconds 10  ;  blocks the current thread until the system clock has reached a timepoint 10 seconds later than now. Although these calls look the same, they are not! For all ..._until   functions, where you pass a timepoint, time adjustments might have an effect. If, during the 10 seconds after calling sleep_until  , the system clock gets adjusted, the timeout will be adjusted accordingly. If, for example, we wind the system clock back 1 hour, the program will block for 60 minutes and 10 seconds. If, for example, we adjust the clock forward for more than 10 seconds, the timer will end immediately.  If you use a ..._for   function, such as sleep_for  , where you pass a duration, or if you use the steady_clock, adjustments of the system clock usually will have no effect on the duration of timers. However, on hardware where a steady clock is not available, and thus the platform gives no chance to count seconds independently of a possibly adjusted system time, time adjustments can also impact the ..._for   functions.  All these timers do not guarantee to be exact. For any timer, there will be a delay because the system only periodically checks for expired timers, and the handling of timers and interrupts takes some time. Thus, durations of timers will take their speciﬁed time plus a period that depends on the quality of implementation and the current situation.   5.8 Header Files  ,  , and    161  5.8 Header Files  ,  ,  and    The following header ﬁles compatible with C are often used in C++ programs:  ,  , and  . They are the C++ versions of the C header ﬁles  ,  , and   and they deﬁne some common constants, macros, types, and func- tions.  5.8.1 Deﬁnitions in    Identiﬁer NULL nullptr_t size_t ptrdiff_t max_align_t offsetof type,mem  Offset of a member mem in a structure or union type  Meaning Pointer value for “not deﬁned” or “no value” Type of nullptr  since C++11  Unsigned type for size units, such as number of elements Signed type for differences of pointer Type with maximum alignment in all contexts  since C++11   Table5.26. Deﬁnitionsin    Table 5.26 shows the deﬁnitions of the   header ﬁle. Before C++11, NULL was of- ten used to indicate that a pointer points to nothing. Since C++11, nullptr is provided for this semantics  see Section 3.1.1, page 14 .  Note that NULL in C++ is guaranteed to be simply the value 0  either as an int or as a long . In C, NULL is often deﬁned as  void* 0. However, this is incorrect in C++, which requires that the type of NULL be an integer type. Otherwise, you could not assign NULL to a pointer. This is because in C++ there is no automatic conversion from void* to any other type. Since C++11, you should use nullptr instead  see Section 3.1.1, page 14 .31 Note also that NULL is also deﬁned in the header ﬁles  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  .  31 Due to the mess with the type of NULL, several people and style guides recommend not using NULL in C++. Instead, 0 or a special user-deﬁned constant, such as NIL, might work better. Fortunately, this problem is solved with nullptr.   162  Chapter 5: Utilities  5.8.2 Deﬁnitions in    Table 5.27 shows the most important deﬁnitions of the   header ﬁle. The two constants EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE are deﬁned as arguments for exit   and can also be used as a return value in main  .

Deﬁnitionsin    The functions that are registered by atexit   are called at normal program termination in reverse order of their registration. It doesn’t matter whether the program exits due to a call of exit   or the end of main  . No arguments are passed.  The exit   and abort   functions are provided to terminate a program in any function without going back to main  :   exit   destroys all static objects, ﬂushes all buffers, closes all I O channels, and terminates If functions passed to atexit   throw  the program, including calling atexit   functions. exceptions, terminate   is called.    abort   terminates a program immediately with no cleanup. Neither of these functions destroys local objects, because no stack unwinding occurs. To ensure that the destructors of all local objects are called, you should use exceptions or the ordinary return mechanism to return to and exit main  .  Since C++11, the quick_exit   semantics provided does not destroy objects but calls func- tions registered by calls to at_quick_exit   in the reverse order of their registration and calls _Exit  , which terminates the program then without any destruction or cleanup.32 This means that quick_exit   and _Exit   do not ﬂush standard ﬁle buffers  standard output and error output .  The usual way for C++ to abort programs — which is an unexpected end in contrast to an ex- pected end signaling an error — is to call std::terminate  , which by default calls abort  . This is done, for example, if a destructor or a function declared with noexcept  see Section 3.1.7, page 24  throws.  32 This feature was introduced to avoid the risk that detached threads access global static objects  see Sec- tion 18.2.1, page 967 .   5.8 Header Files  ,  , and    163  5.8.3 Deﬁnitions in    Table 5.28 shows the most important deﬁnitions of the   header ﬁle: the low-level func- tions to set, copy, and move memory.

Deﬁnitionsin     This page intentionally left blank    Chapter 6 The Standard Template Library  The heart of the C++ standard library — the part that inﬂuenced its overall architecture — is the standard template library  STL . The STL is a generic library that provides solutions to managing collections of data with modern and efﬁcient algorithms. It allows programmers to beneﬁt from innovations in the area of data structures and algorithms without needing to learn how they work.  From the programmer’s point of view, the STL provides a bunch of collection classes that meet various needs, together with several algorithms that operate on them. All components of the STL are templates, so they can be used for arbitrary element types. But the STL does even more: It provides a framework for supplying other collection classes or algorithms for which existing collection classes and algorithms work. All in all, the STL gives C++ a new level of abstraction. Forget programming dynamic arrays, linked lists, binary trees, or hash tables; forget programming different search algo- rithms. To use the appropriate kind of collection, you simply deﬁne the appropriate container and call the corresponding member functions and algorithms to process the data.  The STL’s ﬂexibility, however, has a price, chief of which is that it is not self-explanatory. There- fore, the subject of the STL ﬁlls several chapters in this book. This chapter introduces the general concept of the STL and explains the programming techniques needed to use it. The ﬁrst examples show how to use the STL and what to consider while doing so. Chapters 7 through 11 discuss the components of the STL  containers, iterators, function objects, and algorithms  in detail and present several more examples.  6.1 STL Components  The STL is based on the cooperation of various well-structured components, key of which are con- tainers, iterators, and algorithms:   Containers are used to manage collections of objects of a certain kind. Every kind of container has its own advantages and disadvantages, so having different container types reﬂects different requirements for collections in programs. The containers may be implemented as arrays or as linked lists, or they may have a special key for every element.   166  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library    Iterators are used to step through the elements of collections of objects. These collections may be containers or subsets of containers. The major advantage of iterators is that they offer a small but common interface for any arbitrary container type. For example, one operation of this interface lets the iterator step to the next element in the collection. This is done independently of the internal structure of the collection. Regardless of whether the collection is an array, a tree, or a hash table, it works. This is because every container class provides its own iterator type that simply “does the right thing” because it knows the internal structure of its container.  The interface for iterators is almost the same as for ordinary pointers. To increment an iterator, you call operator ++. To access the value of an iterator, you use operator *. So, you might consider an iterator a kind of a smart pointer that translates the call “go to the next element” into whatever is appropriate.   Algorithms are used to process the elements of collections. For example, algorithms can search, sort, modify, or simply use the elements for various purposes. Algorithms use iterators. Thus, because the iterator interface for iterators is common for all container types, an algorithm has to be written only once to work with arbitrary containers.  To give algorithms more ﬂexibility, you can supply certain auxiliary functions called by the algorithms. Thus, you can use a general algorithm to suit your needs even if that need is very special or complex. For example, you can provide your own search criterion or a special oper- ation to combine elements. Especially since C++11, with the introduction of lambdas, you can easily specify almost any kind of functionality while running over the elements of a container.  The concept of the STL is based on a separation of data and operations. The data is managed by container classes, and the operations are deﬁned by conﬁgurable algorithms. Iterators are the glue between these two components. They let any algorithm interact with any container  Figure 6.1 .  Figure6.1. STLComponents  In a way, the STL concept contradicts the original idea of object-oriented programming: The STL separates data and algorithms rather than combining them. However, the reason for doing so is very important. In principle, you can combine every kind of container with every kind of algorithm, so the result is a very ﬂexible but still rather small framework.  One fundamental aspect of the STL is that all components work with arbitrary types. As the name “standard template library” indicates, all components are templates for any type, provided that type is able to perform the required operations. Thus, the STL is a good example of the concept of generic programming. Containers and algorithms are generic for arbitrary types and classes, respectively.   cid:2   cid:3   cid:4   cid:5   cid:6   cid:7   cid:4   cid:8   cid:9   cid:10   cid:11   cid:12   cid:3   cid:9   cid:7   cid:5   cid:13   cid:14   cid:15   cid:5   cid:8   cid:9   cid:6   cid:5   cid:3   cid:9   cid:16   cid:2   cid:3   cid:4   cid:5   cid:6   cid:7   cid:4   cid:8   cid:9   cid:2   cid:3   cid:4   cid:5   cid:6   cid:7   cid:4   cid:8   cid:9   6.2 Containers  167  The STL provides even more generic components. By using certain adapters and function ob- jects  or functors , you can supplement, constrain, or conﬁgure the algorithms and the interfaces for special needs. However, I’m jumping the gun. First, I want to explain the concept step-by-step by using examples. This is probably the best way to understand and become familiar with the STL.  6.2 Containers  Container classes, or containers for short, manage a collection of elements. To meet different needs, the STL provides different kinds of containers, as shown in Figure 6.2.  Sequence Containers:   Associative Containers:   Unordered Containers:  Set Multiset:   Unordered Set Multiset:   Map Multimap:   Unordered Map Multimap:   Array:   Vector:   Deque:   List:   Forward-List:   Figure6.2. STLContainerTypes  There are three general kinds of containers: 1. Sequence containers are ordered collections in which every element has a certain position. This position depends on the time and place of the insertion, but it is independent of the value of the element. For example, if you put six elements into an ordered collection by appending each element at the end of the collection, these elements are in the exact order in which you put them. The STL contains ﬁve predeﬁned sequence container classes: array, vector, deque, list, and forward_list.1  2. Associative containers are sorted collections in which the position of an element depends on its value  or key, if it’s a key value pair  due to a certain sorting criterion. If you put six elements into a collection, their value determines their order. The order of insertion doesn’t matter. The STL contains four predeﬁned associative container classes: set, multiset, map, and multimap.  3. Unordered  associative  containers are unordered collections in which the position of an ele- ment doesn’t matter. The only important question is whether a speciﬁc element is in such a collection. Neither the order of insertion nor the value of the inserted element has an inﬂu-  1 Class array was added with TR1; forward_list was added with C++11.   168  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library  ence on the position of the element, and the position might change over the lifetime of the con- tainer. Thus, if you put six elements into a collection, their order is undeﬁned and might change over time. The STL contains four predeﬁned unordered container classes: unordered_set, unordered_multiset, unordered_map, and unordered_multimap.  Unordered containers were introduced with TR1 and created a bit of confusion in container ter- minology. Ofﬁcially, unordered containers are categorized as “unordered associative containers.” For this reason, it’s a bit unclear, what is meant by “associative container”: Is it a general term of  ordered  associative containers and unordered associative containers, or is it the counterpart of un- ordered containers? The answer often depends on the context. Throughout this book, I mean the “old” sorted associative containers when I use the term “associative containers” and use the term “unordered containers” without “associative” in the middle.  The three container categories introduced here are just logical categories according to the way the order of elements is deﬁned. According to this point of view, an associative container can be considered a special kind of sequence container because sorted collections have the additional ability to be ordered according to a sorting criterion. You might expect this, especially if you have used other libraries of collection classes, such as those in Smalltalk or the NIHCL,2 in which sorted collections are derived from ordered collections. However, the STL collection types are completely distinct from one another and have very different implementations that are not derived from one another. As we will see:   Sequence containers are usually implemented as arrays or linked lists.   Associative containers are usually implemented as binary trees.   Unordered containers are usually implemented as hash tables. Strictly speaking, the particular implementation of any container is not deﬁned by the C++ standard library. However, the behavior and complexity speciﬁed by the standard do not leave much room for variation. So, in practice, the implementations differ only in minor details.  When choosing the right container, abilities other than the order of elements might be taken into account. In fact, the automatic sorting of elements in associative containers does not mean that those containers are especially designed for sorting elements. You can also sort the elements of a sequence container. The key advantage of automatic sorting is better performance when you search elements. In particular, you can always use a binary search, which results in logarithmic complexity rather than linear complexity. For example, this means that for a search in a collection of 1,000 elements, you need, on average, only 10 instead of 500 comparisons  see Section 2.2, page 10 . Thus, automatic sorting is only a  useful  “side effect” of the implementation of an associative container, designed to enable better performance.  The following subsections discuss the container classes in detail: how containers are typically implemented and the beneﬁts and drawbacks this introduces. Chapter 7 covers the exact behavior of the container classes, describing their common and individual abilities and member functions in detail. Section 7.12, page 392, discusses in detail when to use which container.  2 The National Institutes of Health’s Class Library was one of the ﬁrst class libraries in C++.   6.2 Containers  169  6.2.1 Sequence Containers  The following sequence containers are predeﬁned in the STL:   Arrays  a class called array    Vectors   Deques   Lists  singly and doubly linked  We start with the discussion of vectors because arrays came later, with TR1, into the C++ standard and have some special properties that are not common for STL containers in general.  Vectors  A vector manages its elements in a dynamic array. It enables random access, which means that you can access each element directly with the corresponding index. Appending and removing elements at the end of the array is very fast.3 However, inserting an element in the middle or at the beginning of the array takes time because all the following elements have to be moved to make room for it while maintaining the order.  The following example deﬁnes a vector for integer values, inserts six elements, and prints the  elements of the vector:     stl vector1.cpp  include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {  vector  coll;     vector container for integer elements     append elements with values 1 to 6 for  int i=1; i<=6; ++i  {  coll.push_back i ;  }     print all elements followed by a space for  int i=0; i<coll.size  ; ++i  {  cout << coll[i] << ’ ’;  } cout << endl;  }  3 Strictly speaking, appending elements is amortized very fast. An individual append may be slow when a vector has to reallocate new memory and to copy existing elements into the new memory. However, because such reallocations are rather rare, the operation is very fast in the long term. See Section 2.2, page 10, for a discussion of complexity.   170  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library  The header ﬁle for vectors is included with  include    The following declaration creates a vector for elements of type int:  vector  coll;  The vector is not initialized by any value, so the default constructor creates it as an empty collection. The push_back   function appends an element to the container:  coll.push_back i ;  This member function is provided for all sequence containers, where appending an element is pos- sible and reasonably fast.  The size   member function returns the number of elements of a container: for  int i=0; i<coll.size  ; ++i  {  size   is provided for any container class except singly linked lists  class forward_list . By using the subscript operator [ ], you can access a single element of a vector:  cout << coll[i] << ’ ’;  Here, the elements are written to the standard output, so the output of the whole program is as follows:  ...  }  1 2 3 4 5 6  Deques  The term deque  it rhymes with “check”4  is an abbreviation for “double-ended queue.” It is a dynamic array that is implemented so that it can grow in both directions. Thus, inserting elements at the end and at the beginning is fast. However, inserting elements in the middle takes time because elements must be moved.  The following example declares a deque for ﬂoating-point values, inserts elements from 1.1 to  6.6 at the front of the container, and prints all elements of the deque:     stl deque1.cpp  include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {  deque  coll;     deque container for ﬂoating-point elements  4 It is only a mere accident that “deque” also sounds like “hack” :-  .   6.2 Containers  171     insert elements from 1.1 to 6.6 each at the front for  int i=1; i<=6; ++i  { coll.push_front i*1.1 ;     insert at the front  }     print all elements followed by a space for  int i=0; i<coll.size  ; ++i  {  cout << coll[i] << ’ ’;  } cout << endl;  }  include    deque  coll;  In this example, the header ﬁle for deques is included with  The following declaration creates an empty collection of ﬂoating-point values:  Here, the push_front   member function is used to insert elements:  coll.push_front i*1.1 ;  push_front   inserts an element at the front of the collection. This kind of insertion results in a reverse order of the elements because each element gets inserted in front of the previous inserted elements. Thus, the output of the program is as follows:  6.6 5.5 4.4 3.3 2.2 1.1  You could also insert elements in a deque by using the push_back   member function. The push_front   function, however, is not provided for vectors, because it would have a bad runtime for vectors  if you insert an element at the front of a vector, all elements have to be moved . Usu- ally, the STL containers provide only those special member functions that in general have “good” performance, where “good” normally means constant or logarithmic complexity. This prevents a programmer from calling a function that might cause bad performance.  Nevertheless, it is possible to insert an element at the beginning of a vector — as it is possible to insert an element in the middle of both vectors and deques — by using a general insert function we will come to later.  Arrays  An array  an object of class array 5 manages its elements in an array of ﬁxed size  sometimes called a “static array” or “C array” . Thus, you can’t change the number of elements but only their values. Consequently, you have to specify its size at creation time. An array also enables random access, which means that you can access each element directly with the corresponding index.  The following example deﬁnes an array for string values:  5 Class array  was introduced with TR1.   172  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library     stl array1.cpp  include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {     array container of 5 string elements: array  coll = { "hello", "world" };     print each element with its index on a line for  int i=0; i<coll.size  ; ++i  {  cout << i << ": " << coll[i] << endl;  }  }  The header ﬁle for arrays is included with  include    The following declaration creates an array for ﬁve elements of type string:  array  coll  By default, these elements are initialized with the default constructor of the element’s type. This means that for fundamental data types, the initial value is undeﬁned.  However, in this program, an initializer list  see Section 3.1.3, page 15  is used, which allows initializing class objects at creation time by a list of values. Since C++11, such a way of initialization is provided by every container, so we could also use it for vectors and deques. In that case, for fundamental data types zero initialization is used, which means that fundamental data types are guaranteed to be initialized with 0  see Section 3.2.1, page 37 .  Here, by using size   and the subscript operator [ ], all elements are written with their index  line-by-line to the standard output. The output of the whole program is as follows:  0: hello 1: world 2: 3: 4:  As you can see, the program outputs ﬁve lines, because we have an array with ﬁve strings deﬁned. According to the initializer list, the ﬁrst two elements were initialized with "hello" and "world", and the remaining elements have their default value, which is the empty string.  Note that the number of elements is a part of the type of an array. Thus, array  and  array  are two different types, and you can’t assign or compare them as a whole.   6.2 Containers  Lists  173  Historically, we had only one list class in C++11. However, since C++11, two different list contain- ers are provided by the STL: class list  and class forward_list . Thus, the term list might refer to the speciﬁc class or be a general term for both list classes. However, to some extent, a for- ward list is just a restricted list and, in practice, this difference is not so important. So, when I use the term list I usually mean class list , which nevertheless often implies that abilities also apply to class forward_list . For speciﬁcs of class forward_list , I use the term forward list. So, this subsection discusses “ordinary” lists, which have been part of the STL since the beginning.  A list  is implemented as a doubly linked list of elements. This means each element in the  list has its own segment of memory and refers to its predecessor and its successor.  Lists do not provide random access. For example, to access the tenth element, you must navigate the ﬁrst nine elements by following the chain of their links. However, a step to the next or previous element is possible in constant time. Thus, the general access to an arbitrary element takes linear time because the average distance is proportional to the number of elements. This is a lot worse than the amortized constant time provided by vectors and deques.  The advantage of a list is that the insertion or removal of an element is fast at any position. Only the links must be changed. This implies that moving an element in the middle of a list is very fast compared to moving an element in a vector or a deque.  The following example creates an empty list of characters, inserts all characters from ’a’ to ’z’,  list  coll;     list container for character elements  and prints all elements:     stl list1.cpp  include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {     append elements from ’a’ to ’z’ for  char c=’a’; c<=’z’; ++c  {  coll.push_back c ;  }     print all elements:    - use range-based for loop for  auto elem : coll  { cout << elem << ’ ’;  } cout << endl;  }   174  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library  As usual, the header ﬁle for lists,  , is used to deﬁne a collection of type list for character values:  list  coll;  To print all elements, a range-based for loop is used, which is available since C++11 and allows performing statements with each element  see Section 3.1.4, page 17 . A direct element access by using operator [ ] is not provided for lists. This is because lists don’t provide random access, and so an operator [ ] would have bad performance.  Inside the loop, auto is used to declare the type of the coll element currently being processed. Thus, the type of elem is automatically deduced as char because coll is a collection of chars  see Section 3.1.2, page 14, for details of type deduction with auto . Instead, you could also explicitly declare the type of elem:  for  char elem : coll  {  ...  }  }  Note that elem is always a copy of the element currently processed. Thus, you can modify it, but this would have an effect only for the statements called for this element. Inside coll, nothing gets modiﬁed. To modify the elements in the passed collection, you have to declare elem to be a nonconstant reference:  for  auto& elem : coll  {  ...     any modiﬁcation of elem modiﬁes the current element in coll  As for function parameters, you should generally use a constant reference to avoid a copy operation. Thus, the following function template outputs all elements of a passed container:  template   void printElements  const T& coll  {  for  const auto& elem : coll  {  std::cout << elem << std::endl;  }  }  Before C++11, you had to use iterators to access all elements. Iterators are introduced later, so you will ﬁnd a corresponding example in Section 6.3, page 189.  However, another way to “print” all elements before C++11  without using iterators  is to print  and remove the ﬁrst element while there are elements in the list:     stl list2.cpp  include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {   6.2 Containers  175  list  coll;     list container for character elements     append elements from ’a’ to ’z’ for  char c=’a’; c<=’z’; ++c  {  coll.push_back c ;     print all elements    - while there are elements    - print and remove the ﬁrst element while  ! coll.empty    {  cout << coll.front   << ’ ’; coll.pop_front  ;  } cout << endl;  }  ...  }  }  The empty   member function returns whether the container has no elements. The loop continues as long as it returns false  that is, the container contains elements :  while  ! coll.empty    {  Inside the loop, the front   member function returns the ﬁrst element:  cout << coll.front   << ’ ’;  The pop_front   function removes the ﬁrst element:  coll.pop_front  ;  Note that pop_front   does not return the element it removed. Thus, you can’t combine the previ- ous two statements into one.  The output of the program depends on the character set in use. For the ASCII character set, it is  a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z  as follows:6  Forward Lists  Since C++11, the C++ standard library provides an additional list container: a forward list. A forward_list  is implemented as a singly linked list of elements. As in an ordinary list, each element has its own segment of memory, but to save memory the element refers only to its successor.  6 For other character sets, the output may contain characters that aren’t letters, or it may even be empty  if ’z’ is not greater than ’a’ .   176  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library  As a consequence, a forward list is in principle just a limited list, where all operations that move backward or that would cause a performance penalty are not supported. For this reason, member functions such as push_back   and even size   are not provided.  In practice, this limitation is even more awkward than it sounds. One problem is that you can’t search for an element and then delete it or insert another element in front of it. The reason is that to delete an element, you have to be at the position of the preceding element, because that is the element that gets manipulated to get a new successor. As a consequence, forward lists provide special member functions, discussed in Section 7.6.2, page 305.  Here is a small example of forward lists:     create forward-list container for some prime numbers forward_list  coll = { 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17 };     stl forwardlist1.cpp  include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {     resize two times    - note: poor performance coll.resize 9 ; coll.resize 10,99 ;     print all elements: for  auto elem : coll  { cout << elem << ’ ’;  } cout << endl;  }  As usual, the header ﬁle for forward lists,  , is used to be able to deﬁne a collection of type forward_list for long integer values, initialized by some prime numbers:  forward_list  coll = { 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17 };  If the size grows, you can pass an Then resize   is used to change the number of elements. additional parameter to specify the value of the new elements. Otherwise, the default value  zero for fundamental types  is used. Note that calling resize   is really an expensive operation here. It has linear complexity because to reach the end, you have to go element-by-element through the whole list. But this is one of the operations almost all sequence containers provide, ignoring possible bad performance  only arrays do not provide resize  , because their size is constant .  As for lists, we use a range-based for loop to print all elements. The output is as follows: 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 0 0 99   6.2 Containers  177  6.2.2 Associative Containers  Associative containers sort their elements automatically according to a certain ordering criterion. The elements can be either values of any type or key value pairs. For key value pairs, each key, which might be of any type, maps to an associated value, which might be of any type. The criterion to sort the elements takes the form of a function that compares either the value or, if it’s a key value pair, the key. By default, the containers compare the elements or the keys with operator <. However, you can supply your own comparison function to deﬁne another ordering criterion.  Associative containers are typically implemented as binary trees. Thus, every element  every node  has one parent and two children. All ancestors to the left have lesser values; all ancestors to the right have greater values. The associative containers differ in the kinds of elements they support and how they handle duplicates.  may occur only once, so duplicates are not allowed.  The following associative containers are predeﬁned in the STL:  The major advantage of associative containers is that ﬁnding an element with a speciﬁc value is rather fast because it has logarithmic complexity  in all sequence containers, you have linear complexity . Thus, when using associative containers, with 1,000 elements you have 10 instead of 500 comparisons on average. However, a drawback is that you can’t modify values directly, because doing so would corrupt the automatic sorting of the elements.   A set is a collection in which elements are sorted according to their own values. Each element   A multiset is the same as a set except that duplicates are allowed. Thus, a multiset may contain   A map contains elements that are key value pairs. Each element has a key that is the basis for the sorting criterion and a value. Each key may occur only once, so duplicate keys are not allowed. A map can also be used as an associative array, an array that has an arbitrary index type  see Section 6.2.4, page 185, for details .   A multimap is the same as a map except that duplicates are allowed. Thus, a multimap may contain multiple elements that have the same key. A multimap can also be used as dictionary  See Section 7.8.5, page 348, for an example .  multiple elements that have the same value.  All these associative container classes have an optional template argument for the sorting criterion. The default sorting criterion is the operator <. The sorting criterion is also used as the test for equivalence;7 that is, two elements are duplicates if neither of their values keys is less than the other. You can consider a set as a special kind of map, in which the value is identical to the key. In fact, all these associative container types are usually implemented by using the same basic implementation of a binary tree.  Examples of Using Sets and Multisets  Here is a ﬁrst example, using a multiset:  7 Note that I use the term equivalent here, not equal, which usually implies using operator == for the element as a whole.   178  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library  multiset  cities {  "Braunschweig", "Hanover", "Frankfurt", "New York", "Chicago", "Toronto", "Paris", "Frankfurt"     stl multiset1.cpp  include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {  };     print each element: for  const auto& elem : cities  {  cout << elem << "  ";  } cout << endl;     print each element: for  const auto& elem : cities  {  cout << elem << "  ";  } cout << endl;  }     insert additional values: cities.insert  {"London", "Munich", "Hanover", "Braunschweig"}  ;  After declaring the set types in the header ﬁle  , we can declare cities being a multiset of strings:  multiset  cities  With the declaration, a couple of elements are passed for initialization and later inserted using an initializer list  see Section 3.1.3, page 15 . To print all the elements, we use a range-based for loop  see Section 3.1.4, page 17 . Note that we declare the elements to be const auto&, which means that we derive the type of the elements from the container  see Section 3.1.2, page 14  and avoid having to create a copy for each element the body of the loop is called for. Internally, all the elements are sorted, so the ﬁrst output is as follows: Braunschweig Hanover  Frankfurt  Frankfurt  New York  Chicago  Paris  Toronto  The second output is:   6.2 Containers  179  Braunschweig  Braunschweig  Hanover  London  Munich  Chicago New York  Frankfurt Paris Toronto  Frankfurt  Hanover  As you can see, because we use a multiset rather than a set, duplicates are allowed. If we had declared a set instead of a multiset, each value would be printed only once. If we were to use an unordered multiset, the order of the elements would be undeﬁned  see Section 6.2.3, page 182 .  Examples of Using Maps and Multimaps  The following example demonstrates the use of maps and multimaps:  multimap  coll;     container for int string values     stl multimap1.cpp  include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {     insert some elements in arbitrary order    - a value with key 1 gets inserted twice coll = { {5,"tagged"},  {2,"a"}, {1,"this"}, {4,"of"}, {6,"strings"}, {1,"is"}, {3,"multimap"} };     print all element values    - element member second is the value for  auto elem : coll  {  cout << elem.second << ’ ’;  } cout << endl;  }  After including  , a map with elements that have an int as the key and a string as value gets declared:  multimap  coll;  Because the elements of maps and multimaps are key value pairs, the declaration, the insertion, and the access to elements are a bit different:   180  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library    First, to initialize  or assign or insert  elements, you have to pass key value pairs, which is done here by assigning nested initializer lists. The inner lists deﬁne the key and the value of each element; the outer list groups all these elements. Thus, {5,"tagged"} speciﬁes the ﬁrst element inserted.   When processing the elements, you again have to deal with key value pairs. In fact, the type of an element is pair   type pair is introduced in Section 5.1.1, page 60 . The key is constant because any modiﬁcation of its value would break the order of the elements, which are automatically sorted by the container. Because pairs don’t have an output operator, you can’t print them as a whole. Instead, you must access the members of the pair structure, which are called first and second.  Thus, the following expression yields the second part of the key value pair, which is the value  of the multimap element:  elem.second  Similarly, the following expression yields the ﬁrst part of the key value pair, which is the key of the multimap element:  elem.first  As a result, the program has the following output: this is a multimap of tagged strings  Before C++11, there was no clear guarantee for the order of equivalent elements  elements having an equal key . So, until C++11, the order of "this" and "is" might be the other way around. C++11 guarantees that newly inserted elements are inserted at the end of equivalent elements that multisets and multimaps already contain. In addition, the order of equivalent elements is guaranteed to remain stable if insert  , emplace  , or erase   is called.  Other Examples for Associative Containers  Section 6.2.4, page 185, gives an example for using a map, which can be used as a so-called asso- ciative array.  Section 7.7 discusses sets and multisets in detail, with additional examples. Section 7.8 discusses  maps and multimaps in detail, with additional examples.  Multimaps can also be used as dictionaries. See Section 7.8.5, page 348, for an example.  6.2.3 Unordered Containers  In unordered containers, elements have no deﬁned order. Thus, if you insert three elements, they might have any order when you iterate over all the elements in the container. If you insert a fourth element, the order of the elements previously inserted might change. The only important fact is that a speciﬁc element is somewhere in the container. Even when you have two containers with equal elements inside, the order might be different. Think of it as like a bag.  Unordered containers are typically implemented as a hash table  Figure 6.3 . Thus, internally, the container is an array of linked lists. Using a hash function, the position of an element in the array gets processed. The goal is that each element has its own position so that you have fast access to   6.2 Containers  181  Values Keys:   Hash function:   Buckets:   Entries  linked list :  Anica  Fred  George  Jack  Jennifer  Jutta  Lucas  Nico  Timothy   hashfunc     Jack   Nico   Timothy   Anica   Jutta   Lucas   George   Fred   Jennifer   Figure6.3. UnorderedContainersAreHashTables  each element, provided that the hash function is fast. But because such a fast perfect hash function is not always possible or might require that the array consumes a huge amount of memory, multiple elements might have the same position. For this reason, the elements in the array are linked lists so that you can store more than one element at each array position.  The major advantage of unordered containers is that ﬁnding an element with a speciﬁc value is even faster than for associative containers. In fact, the use of unordered containers provides amortized constant complexity, provided that you have a good hash function. However, providing a good hash function is not easy  see Section 7.9.2, page 363 , and you might need a lot of memory for the buckets.  once. Thus, duplicates are not allowed.  an unordered multiset may contain multiple elements that have the same value.  According to associative containers, the following unordered containers are predeﬁned in the STL:   An unordered set is a collection of unordered elements, where each element may occur only   An unordered multiset is the same as an unordered set except that duplicates are allowed. Thus,   An unordered map contains elements that are key value pairs. Each key may occur only once, so duplicate keys are not allowed. An unordered map can also be used as an associative array, an array that has an arbitrary index type  see Section 6.2.4, page 185, for details .   An unordered multimap is the same as an unordered map except that duplicates are allowed. Thus, an unordered multimap may contain multiple elements that have the same key. An un- ordered multimap can also be used as dictionary  see Section 7.9.7, page 383, for an example .   182  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library  All these unordered container classes have a couple of optional template arguments to specify a hash function and an equivalence criterion. The equivalence criterion is used to ﬁnd speciﬁc values and to identify duplicates. The default equivalence criterion is the operator ==.  You can consider an unordered set as a special kind of unordered map, in which the value is identical to the key. In fact, all these unordered container types are usually implemented by using the same basic implementation of a hash table.  Examples of Using Unordered Sets and Multisets  Here is a ﬁrst example, using an unordered multiset of strings:     stl unordmultiset1.cpp  include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {  };     print each element: for  const auto& elem : cities  {  cout << elem << "  ";  } cout << endl;  unordered_multiset  cities {  "Braunschweig", "Hanover", "Frankfurt", "New York", "Chicago", "Toronto", "Paris", "Frankfurt"     insert additional values: cities.insert  {"London", "Munich", "Hanover", "Braunschweig"}  ;     print each element: for  const auto& elem : cities  {  cout << elem << "  ";  } cout << endl;  }  After including the required header ﬁle  include    we can declare and initialize an unordered set of strings: unordered_multiset  cities { ... };   6.2 Containers  183  Now, if we print all elements, the order might be different because the order is undeﬁned. The only guarantee is that duplicates, which are possible because a multiset is used, are grouped together in the order of their insertion. Thus, a possible output might be: Frankfurt  Frankfurt  New York  Chicago  Hanover  Paris  Toronto Braunschweig  Any insertion can change this order. In fact, any operation that causes rehashing can change this order. So, after inserting a couple more values, the output might be as follows: New York  Frankfurt  Frankfurt  Hanover  Hanover  Chicago  London  Munich  Braunschweig  Braunschweig  Toronto  Paris  What happens depends on the rehashing policy, which can be inﬂuenced in part by the programmer. For example, you can reserve enough room so that rehashing won’t happen up to a speciﬁc number of elements. In addition, to ensure that you can delete elements while processing all elements, the standard guarantees that deleting elements does not cause a rehashing. But an insertion after a deletion might cause rehashing. For details, see Section 7.9, page 355.  In general, associative and unordered containers provide the same interface. Only declarations might differ, and unordered containers provide special member functions to inﬂuence the internal behavior or to inspect the current state. Thus, in the example presented here, only the header ﬁles and types differ from the corresponding example using an ordinary multiset, which was introduced in Section 6.2.2, page 177.  Again, before C++11, you needed iterators to access the elements. See Section 6.3.1, page 193,  for an example.  Examples of Using Unordered Maps and Multimaps  The example presented for multimaps on page 179 also works for an unordered multimap if you replace map by unordered_map in the include directive and multimap by unordered_multimap in the declaration of the container: include   ... unordered_multimap  coll; ...  The only difference is that the order of the elements is undeﬁned. However, on most platforms, the elements will still be sorted because as a default hash function, the modulo operator is used. Thus, a sorted order is also a valid undeﬁned order. However, that’s not guaranteed, and if you add more elements, the order will be different.  Here is another example using an unordered map. In this case, we use an unordered map where  the keys are strings and the values are doubles:     stl unordmap1.cpp  include   include     184  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library  include   using namespace std;  int main   {  unordered_map  coll { { "tim", 9.9 },  { "struppi", 11.77 }  };     square the value of each element: for  pair & elem : coll  {  elem.second *= elem.second;     print each element  key and value : for  const auto& elem : coll  {  cout << elem.first << ": " << elem.second << endl;  After the usual includes for maps, strings, and iostreams, an unordered map is declared and initial- ized by two elements. Here, we use nested initializer lists so that  { "tim", 9.9 }  and  { "struppi", 11.77 }  are the two elements used to initialize the map. Next, we square the value of each element: for  pair & elem : coll  {  elem.second *= elem.second;  Here again, you can see the internal type of the elements, which is a pair   see Section 5.1.1, page 60  of constant strings and doubles. Thus, we could not modify the key member first in the element:  for  pair & elem : coll  {  elem.first = ...;     ERROR: keys of a map are constant  As usual since C++11, we don’t have to specify the type of the elements explicitly, because in a range-based for loop, it is deduced from the container. For this reason, the second loop, which outputs all elements, uses auto. In fact, by declaring elem as const auto&, we avoid having copies created:  }  }  }  }  }   6.2 Containers  185  for  const auto& elem : coll  {  cout << elem.first << ": " << elem.second << endl;  As a result, one possible output of the program is as follows:  }  struppi: 138.533 tim: 98.01  This order is not guaranteed, because the actual order is undeﬁned. If we used an ordinary map instead, the order of the elements would be guaranteed to print the element with key "struppi" before the element with key "tim", because the map sorts the elements according to the key, and the string "struppi" is less than "tim". See Section 7.8.5, page 345, for a corresponding example using a map and also using algorithms and lambdas instead of range-based for loops.  Other Examples for Unordered Containers  The classes for unordered containers provide a couple of additional optional template arguments, such as the hash function and the equivalence comparison. A default hash function is provided for fundamental types and strings, but we would have to declare our own hash function for other types. This is discussed in Section 7.9.2, page 363.  The next section gives an example for using a map as a so-called associative array. Section 7.9 discusses unordered containers in detail, with additional examples. Unordered multimaps can also be used as dictionaries  see Section 7.9.7, page 383, for an example .  6.2.4 Associative Arrays  Both maps and unordered maps are collections of key value pairs with unique keys. Such a collection can also be thought of as an associative array, an array whose index is not an integer value. As a consequence, both containers provide the subscript operator [ ].  Consider the following example:     stl assoarray1.cpp  include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {     type of the container:    - unordered_map: elements are key value pairs    - string: keys have type string    - float: values have type float unordered_map  coll;   186  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library     insert some elements into the collection    - using the syntax of an associative array coll["VAT1"] = 0.16; coll["VAT2"] = 0.07; coll["Pi"] = 3.1415; coll["an arbitrary number"] = 4983.223; coll["Null"] = 0;     change value coll["VAT1"] += 0.03;     print difference of VAT values cout << "VAT difference: " << coll["VAT1"] - coll["VAT2"] << endl;  }  The declaration of the container type must specify both the type of the key and the type of the value:  unordered_map  coll;  This means that the keys are strings and the associated values are ﬂoating-point values.  According to the concept of associative arrays, you can access elements by using the subscript operator [ ]. Note, however, that the subscript operator does not behave like the usual subscript operator for arrays: Not having an element for an index is not an error. A new index  or key  is taken as a reason to create and insert a new map element that has the index as the key. Thus, you can’t have an invalid index.  Therefore, in this example, the statement coll["VAT1"] = 0.16;  creates a new element, which has the key "VAT1" and the value 0.16.  In fact, the following expression creates a new element that has the key "VAT1" and is initialized  with its default value  using the default constructor or 0 for fundamental data types :  coll["VAT1"]  The whole expression yields access to the value of this new element, so the assignment operator assigns 0.16 then.  Since C++11, you can, alternatively, use at   to access values of elements while passing the  key. In this case, a key not found results in an out_of_range exception:  coll.at "VAT1"  = 0.16;     out_of_range exception if no element found  With expressions such as  coll["VAT1"] += 0.03;  or  coll["VAT1"] - coll["VAT2"]  you gain read and write access to the value of these elements. Thus, the output of the program is as follows:  VAT difference: 0.12   6.2 Containers  187  As usual, the difference between using an unordered map and a map is that the elements in an unordered map have arbitrary order, whereas the elements in a map are sorted. But because the complexity for element access is amortized constant for unordered maps rather than logarithmic for maps, you should usually prefer unordered maps over maps unless you need the sorting or can’t use an unordered map because your environment does not support features of C++11. In that case, you simply have to change the type of the container: remove the “unordered_” in both the include directive and the container declaration.  Section 7.8.3, page 343, and Section 7.9.5, page 374, discuss maps and unordered_maps as  associative arrays in more detail.  6.2.5 Other Containers  Strings  You can also use strings as STL containers. By strings, I mean objects of the C++ string classes  basic_string , string, and wstring , which are introduced in Chapter 13. Strings are similar to vectors but have characters as elements. Section 13.2.14, page 684, provides details.  Ordinary C-Style Arrays  Another kind of container is a type of the core C and C++ language rather than a class: an ordinary array  “C-style array”  that has a declared ﬁxed size or a dynamic size managed by malloc   and realloc  . However, such ordinary arrays are not STL containers, because they don’t provide member functions, such as size   and empty  . Nevertheless, the STL’s design allows you to call algorithms for them.  The use of ordinary arrays is nothing new. What is new is using algorithms for them. This is  explained in Section 7.10.2, page 386.  In C++, it is no longer necessary to program C-style arrays directly. Vectors and arrays pro- vide all properties of ordinary C-style arrays but with a safer and more convenient interface. See Section 7.2.3, page 267, and Section 7.3.3, page 278, for details.  User-Deﬁned Containers  In principle, you can give any container-like object a corresponding STL interface to be able to iterate through elements or provide standard operations to manipulate its content. For example, you might introduce a class that represents a directory where you can iterate over the ﬁles as elements and manipulate them. The best candidates for STL-container-like interfaces are the common container operations introduced in Section 7.1, page 254.  However, some container-like objects do not ﬁt into the concept of the STL. For example, the fact that STL containers have a begin and an end makes it hard for circular container types, such as a ring buffer, to ﬁt into the STL framework.   188  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library  6.2.6 Container Adapters  In addition to the fundamental container classes, the C++ standard library provides so-called con- tainer adapters, which are predeﬁned containers that provide a restricted interface to meet special needs. These container adapters are implemented by using the fundamental container classes. The predeﬁned container adapters are as follows:   A stack  the name says it all  manages its elements by the LIFO  last-in-ﬁrst-out  policy.   A queue manages its elements by the FIFO  ﬁrst-in-ﬁrst-out  policy. That is, it is an ordinary   A priority queue is a container in which the elements may have different priorities. The priority is based on a sorting criterion that the programmer may provide  by default, operator < is used . A priority queue is, in effect, a buffer in which the next element is always one having the highest priority inside the queue. If more than one element has the highest priority, the order of these elements is undeﬁned.  buffer.  Container adapters are historically part of the STL. However, from a programmer’s viewpoint, they are just special container classes that use the general framework of the containers, iterators, and algorithms provided by the STL. Therefore, container adapters are described apart from the STL core in Chapter 12.  6.3 Iterators  Since C++11, we can process all elements by using a range-based for loop. However, to ﬁnd an element, we don’t want to process all elements. Instead, we have to iterate over all elements until we ﬁnd what we are searching for. In addition, we probably want to be able to store this position somewhere, for example, to continue with the iteration or some other processing later on. Thus, we need a concept of an object that represents positions of elements in a container. This concept exists. Objects that fulﬁll this concept are called iterators. In fact, as we will see, range-based for loops are a convenience interface to this concept. That is, they internally use iterator objects that iterate over all elements.  backward by using operator --.  use operator -> to access those members directly from the iterator.  An iterator is an object that can iterate over elements  navigate from element to element . These elements may be all or a subset of the elements of an STL container. An iterator represents a certain position in a container. The following fundamental operations deﬁne the behavior of an iterator:   Operator * returns the element of the current position. If the elements have members, you can   Operator ++ lets the iterator step forward to the next element. Most iterators also allow stepping   Operators == and != return whether two iterators represent the same position.   Operator = assigns an iterator  the position of the element to which it refers . These operations provide exactly the interface of ordinary pointers in C and C++ when these pointers are used to iterate over the elements of an ordinary array. The difference is that iterators may be smart pointers — pointers that iterate over more complicated data structures of containers. The internal behavior of iterators depends on the data structure over which they iterate. Hence, each container type supplies its own kind of iterator. As a result, iterators share the same interface but have different   6.3 Iterators  189  types. This leads directly to the concept of generic programming: Operations use the same interface but different types, so you can use templates to formulate generic operations that work with arbitrary types that satisfy the interface.  All container classes provide the same basic member functions that enable them to use iterators to navigate over their elements. The most important of these functions are as follows:   begin   returns an iterator that represents the beginning of the elements in the container. The   end   returns an iterator that represents the end of the elements in the container. The end is the  beginning is the position of the ﬁrst element, if any.  position behind the last element. Such an iterator is also called a past-the-end iterator.  begin    end    Figure6.4. begin   and end   forContainers  Thus, begin   and end   deﬁne a half-open range that includes the ﬁrst element but excludes the last  Figure 6.4 . A half-open range has two advantages: 1. You have a simple end criterion for loops that iterate over the elements: They simply continue as  long as end   is not reached. It avoids special handling for empty ranges. For empty ranges, begin   is equal to end  .  2.  The following example demonstrating the use of iterators prints all elements of a list container  it is the iterator-based version of the ﬁrst list example in Section 6.2.1, page 173 :     stl list1old.cpp  include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {  list  coll;     list container for character elements     append elements from ’a’ to ’z’ for  char c=’a’; c<=’z’; ++c  {  coll.push_back c ;  }   190  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library     print all elements:    - iterate over all elements list ::const_iterator pos; for  pos = coll.begin  ; pos != coll.end  ; ++pos  {  cout << *pos << ’ ’;  } cout << endl;  }  }  }  Again, after the list is created and ﬁlled with the characters ’a’ through ’z’, we print all elements. But instead of using a range-based for loop:  for  auto elem : coll  { cout << elem << ’ ’;  all elements are printed within an ordinary for loop using an iterator iterating over all elements of the container:  list ::const_iterator pos; for  pos = coll.begin  ; pos != coll.end  ; ++pos  {  cout << *pos << ’ ’;  The iterator pos is declared just before the loop. Its type is the iterator type for constant element access of its container class:  list ::const_iterator pos;  In fact, every container deﬁnes two iterator types: 1. container::iterator is provided to iterate over elements in read write mode. 2. container::const_iterator is provided to iterate over elements in read-only mode. For example, in class list, the deﬁnitions might look like the following:  namespace std {  template   class list {  public:  typedef ... iterator; typedef ... const_iterator; ...  };  }  The exact type of iterator and const_iterator is implementation deﬁned.  Inside the for loop, the iterator pos ﬁrst gets initialized with the position of the ﬁrst element: pos = coll.begin     6.3 Iterators  191  The loop continues as long as pos has not reached the end of the container elements:  pos != coll.end    Here, pos is compared with a so-called past-the-end iterator, which represents the position right behind the last element. While the loop runs the increment operator, ++pos navigates the iterator pos to the next element.  All in all, pos iterates from the ﬁrst element, element-by-element, until it reaches the end  Fig- ure 6.5 . If the container has no elements, the loop does not run, because coll.begin   would equal coll.end  .  begin    pos  ++  end    Figure6.5. Iterator pos IteratingoverElementsofaList  In the body of the loop, the expression *pos represents the current element. In this example, it is written to the standard output cout, followed by a space character. You can’t modify the elements, because a const_iterator is used. Thus, from the iterator’s point of view, the elements are constant. However, if you use a nonconstant iterator and the type of the elements is nonconstant, you can change the values. For example:     make all characters in the list uppercase list ::iterator pos; for  pos = coll.begin  ; pos != coll.end  ; ++pos  {  *pos = toupper *pos ;  }  If we use iterators to iterate over the elements of  unordered  maps and multimaps, pos would again refer to key value pairs. Thus, the expression  would yield the second part of the key value pair, which is the value of the element, whereas  pos->second  pos->first  would yield its  constant  key.  ++pos versus pos++  Note that the preincrement operator  preﬁx ++  is used here to move the iterator to the next element. The reason is that it might have better performance than the postincrement operator. The latter internally involves a temporary object because it must return the old position of the iterator. For   192  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library  this reason, it generally is better to prefer ++pos over pos++. Thus, you should avoid the following version:  for  pos = coll.begin  ; pos != coll.end  ; pos++  {  ^^^^^     OK, but slightly slower  These kinds of performance improvements almost always don’t matter. So, don’t interpret this recommendation to mean that you should do everything to avoid even the smallest performance penalties. Readable and maintainable programs are far more important than optimized performance. The important point here is that in this case, you don’t pay a price for preferring the preincrement over the postincrement version. For this reason, it is a good advice to prefer the preincrement and predecrement operators in general.  cbegin   and cend    Since C++11, we can use the keyword auto  see Section 3.1.2, page 14  to specify the exact type of the iterator  provided that you initialize the iterator during its declaration so that its type can be derived from the initial value . Thus, by initializing the iterator directly with begin  , you can use auto to declare its type:  for  auto pos = coll.begin  ; pos != coll.end  ; ++pos  {  cout << *pos << ’ ’;  As you can see, one advantage of using auto is that the code is more condensed. Without auto, declaring the iterator inside the loop looks as follows:  for  list ::const_iterator pos = coll.begin  ;  pos != coll.end  ; ++pos  {  cout << *pos << ’ ’;  The other advantage is that the loop is robust for such code modiﬁcations as changing the type of the container. However, the drawback is that the iterator loses its constness, which might raise the risk of unintended assignments. With  auto pos = coll.begin    pos becomes a nonconstant iterator because begin   returns an object of type cont::iterator. To ensure that constant iterators are still used, cbegin   and cend   are provided as container functions since C++11. They return an object of type cont::const_iterator.  To summarize the improvements, since C++11, a loop that allows iterating over all the elements  of a container without using a range-based for loop might look as follows:  for  auto pos = coll.cbegin  ; pos != coll.cend  ; ++pos  {  ...  }  }  }  ...  }   6.3 Iterators  193  Range-Based for Loops versus Iterators  Having introduced iterators, we can explain the exact behavior of range-based for loops. For con- tainers, in fact, a range-based for loop is nothing but a convenience interface, which is deﬁned to iterate over all elements of the passed range collection. Within each loop body, the actual element is initialized by the value the current iterator refers to.  Thus, for  type elem : coll  {  ...  is interpreted as  type elem = *pos; ...  }  }  for  auto pos=coll.begin  , end=coll.end  ; pos!=end; ++pos  {  Now we can understand why we should declare elem to be a constant reference to avoid unnecessary copies. Otherwise, elem will be initialized as a copy of *pos. See Section 3.1.4, page 17, for details.  6.3.1 Further Examples of Using Associative and  Unordered Containers  Having introduced iterators, we can present some example programs using associative containers without using such language features of C++11 as range-based for loops, auto, and initializer lists. In addition, the features used here can also be useful with C++11 for some special requirements.  The ﬁrst example shows how to insert elements into a set and use iterators to print them if C++11 features are not available:  Using Sets before C++11     stl set1.cpp  include   include    int main   {     type of the collection typedef std::set  IntSet;  IntSet coll;     set container for int values   194  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library     insert elements from 1 to 6 in arbitrary order    - note that there are two calls of insert   with value 1 coll.insert 3 ; coll.insert 1 ; coll.insert 5 ; coll.insert 4 ; coll.insert 1 ; coll.insert 6 ; coll.insert 2 ;     print all elements    - iterate over all elements IntSet::const_iterator pos; for  pos = coll.begin  ; pos != coll.end  ; ++pos  {  std::cout << *pos << ’ ’;  } std::cout << std::endl;  }  As usual, the include directive deﬁnes all necessary types and operations of sets:  The type of the container is used in several places, so ﬁrst, a shorter type name gets deﬁned:  include    typedef set  IntSet;  This statement deﬁnes type IntSet as a set for elements of type int. This type uses the default sorting criterion, which sorts the elements by using operator <, so the elements are sorted in ascend- ing order. To sort in descending order or use a completely different sorting criterion, you can pass it as a second template parameter. For example, the following statement deﬁnes a set type that sorts the elements in descending order:  typedef set > IntSet;  greater  is a predeﬁned function object discussed in Section 6.10.2, page 239. For a sorting criterion that uses only part of the data of an object, such as the ID, see Section 10.1.1, page 476. All associative containers provide an insert   member function to insert a new element:  coll.insert 3 ; coll.insert 1 ; ...  Since C++11, we can simply call:  coll.insert   { 3, 1, 5, 4, 1, 6, 2 }  ;  Each inserted element receives the correct position automatically according to the sorting criterion. You can’t use the push_back   or push_front   functions provided for sequence containers. They make no sense here, because you can’t specify the position of the new element.  After all values are inserted in any order, the state of the container is as shown in Figure 6.6. The elements are sorted into the internal tree structure of the container, so the value of the left child of an   6.3 Iterators  195  element is always less, with respect to the current sorting criterion, and the value of the right child of an element is always greater. Duplicates are not allowed in a set, so the container contains the value 1 only once.  4  2  6  1  3  5  pos  ++  4  2  6  1  3  5  Figure6.6. ASetofSixElements  To print the elements of the container, you use the same loop as in the previous list example. An  iterator iterates over all elements and prints them:  IntSet::const_iterator pos; for  pos = coll.begin  ; pos != coll.end  ; ++pos  {  cout << *pos << ’ ’;  }  Figure6.7. Iterator pos IteratingoverElementsofaSet  Because it is deﬁned by the container, the iterator does the right thing, even if the internal structure of the container is more complicated. For example, if the iterator refers to the third element, operator ++ moves to the fourth element at the top. After the next call of operator ++, the iterator refers to the ﬁfth element at the bottom  Figure 6.7 . The output of the program is as follows:  1 2 3 4 5 6   196  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library  To use a multiset rather than a set, you need only change the type of the container; the header ﬁle remains the same:  typedef multiset  IntSet;  A multiset allows duplicates, so it would contain two elements that have value 1. Thus, the output of the program would change to the following:  As another example, let’s look in detail at what happens when we iterate over all elements of an unordered multiset. Consider the following example:  1 1 2 3 4 5 6  Details of Using an Unordered Multiset     stl unordmultiset2.cpp  include   include    int main   {     unordered multiset container for int values std::unordered_multiset  coll;     insert some elements coll.insert {1,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,27,1} ;     print all elements for  auto elem : coll  {  std::cout << elem << ’ ’;  } std::cout << std::endl;     insert one more element coll.insert 25 ;     print all elements again for  auto elem : coll  {  std::cout << elem << ’ ’;  } std::cout << std::endl;  }  The order of the elements is undeﬁned. It depends on the internal layout of the hash table and its hashing function. Even when the elements are inserted in sorted order, they have an arbitrary order   6.3 Iterators  197  inside the container.8 Adding one more element might change the order of all existing elements. Thus, one of the possible outputs of this program is as follows:  11 23 1 1 13 3 27 5 17 7 19 23 1 1 25 3 27 5 7 11 13 17 19  As you can see, the order is indeed undeﬁned, but might differ if you run this example on your platform. Adding just one element might change the whole order. However, it is guaranteed that elements with equal values are adjacent to each other.  When iterating over all elements to print them: for  auto elem : coll  {  std::cout << elem << ’ ’;  this is equivalent to the following:  for  auto pos = coll.begin  ; pos != coll.end  ; ++pos  {  auto elem = *pos; std::cout << elem << ’ ’;  }  }  hashfunc     5   1   1   11   23   13   3      + +  27   17   7   19   Figure6.8. Iterator pos IteratingoverElementsofanUnorderedMultiset  8 Note that the order might also be sorted because this is one possible arbitrary order. In fact, if you insert 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, this will typically be the case.   198  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library  Again, the internal iterator pos internally used in the for loop has a type provided by the container so that it “knows” how to iterate over all the elements. So, with this output, the internal state of the unordered multiset might look like Figure 6.8 when the iterator is used to print all the elements the ﬁrst time.  When not allowing duplicates by switching to an unordered set: std::unordered_set  coll;  the output might look as follows:  11 23 1 13 3 27 5 17 7 19 11 23 1 13 25 3 27 5 17 7 19  6.3.2 Iterator Categories  In addition to their fundamental operations, iterators can have capabilities that depend on the in- ternal structure of the container type. As usual, the STL provides only those operations that have good performance. For example, if containers have random access, such as vectors or deques, their iterators are also able to perform random-access operations, such as positioning the iterator directly at the ﬁfth element.  Iterators are subdivided into categories based on their general abilities. The iterators of the  predeﬁned container classes belong to one of the following three categories: 1. Forward iterators are able to iterate only forward, using the increment operator. The itera- tors of the class forward_list are forward iterators. The iterators of the container classes unordered_set, unordered_multiset, unordered_map, and unordered_multimap are “at least” forward iterators  libraries are allowed to provide bidirectional iterators instead, see Section 7.9.1, page 357 .  2. Bidirectional iterators are able to iterate in two directions: forward, by using the increment operator, and backward, by using the decrement operator. The iterators of the container classes list, set, multiset, map, and multimap are bidirectional iterators.  3. Random-access iterators have all the properties of bidirectional iterators.  In addition, they can perform random access. In particular, they provide operators for iterator arithmetic  in accordance with pointer arithmetic of an ordinary pointer . You can add and subtract offsets, process differences, and compare iterators by using relational operators, such as  . The iterators of the container classes vector, deque, array, and iterators of strings are random- access iterators.  In addition, two other iterator categories are deﬁned:   Input iterators are able to read process some values while iterating forward. Input stream itera-   Output iterators are able to write some values while iterating forward. Inserters  Section 6.5.1, page 210  and output stream iterators  see Section 6.5.2, page 212  are examples of such iterators.  tors are an example of such iterators  see Section 6.5.2, page 212 .  Section 9.2, page 433, discusses all iterator categories in detail.   6.4 Algorithms  199  To write generic code that is as independent of the container type as possible, you should not use special operations for random-access iterators. For example, the following loop works with any container:  for  auto pos = coll.begin  ; pos != coll.end  ; ++pos  {  However, the following does not work with all containers:  for  auto pos = coll.begin  ; pos < coll.end  ; ++pos  {  ...  ...  }  }  The only difference is the use of operator < instead of operator != in the condition of the loop. Operator < is provided only for random-access iterators, so this loop does not work with lists, sets, and maps. To write generic code for arbitrary containers, you should use operator != rather than operator <. However, doing so might lead to code that is less safe. The reason is that you may not recognize that pos gets a position behind end    see Section 6.12, page 245, for more details about possible errors when using the STL . It’s up to you to decide which version to use. It might be a question of the context or even of taste.  To avoid misunderstanding, note that I am talking about “categories,” not “classes.” A category deﬁnes only the abilities of iterators. The type doesn’t matter. The generic concept of the STL works with pure abstraction: anything that behaves like a bidirectional iterator is a bidirectional iterator.  6.4 Algorithms  The STL provides several standard algorithms for processing elements of collections. These algo- rithms offer general fundamental services, such as searching, sorting, copying, reordering, modify- ing, and numeric processing.  Algorithms are not member functions of the container classes but instead are global functions that operate with iterators. This has an important advantage: Instead of each algorithm being imple- mented for each container type, all are implemented only once for any container type. The algorithm might even operate on elements of different container types. You can also use the algorithms for user- deﬁned container types. All in all, this concept reduces the amount of code and increases the power and the ﬂexibility of the library.  Note that this is not an object-oriented programming paradigm; it is a generic functional pro- gramming paradigm. Instead of data and operations being uniﬁed, as in object-oriented program- ming, they are separated into distinct parts that can interact via a certain interface. However, this concept also has its price: First, the usage is not intuitive. Second, some combinations of data structures and algorithms might not work. Even worse, a combination of a container type and an algorithm might be possible but not useful  for example, it may lead to bad performance . Thus, it is important to learn the concepts and the pitfalls of the STL to beneﬁt from it without abusing it. I provide examples and more details about this throughout the rest of this chapter.  Let’s start with a simple example of the use of STL algorithms. The following program shows  some algorithms and their usage:   200  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library     stl algo1.cpp  include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {     create vector with elements from 1 to 6 in arbitrary order vector  coll = { 2, 5, 4, 1, 6, 3 };     ﬁnd and print minimum and maximum elements auto minpos = min_element coll.cbegin  ,coll.cend   ; cout << "min: " << *minpos << endl; auto maxpos = max_element coll.cbegin  ,coll.cend   ; cout << "max: " << *maxpos << endl;     sort all elements sort  coll.begin  , coll.end   ;     ﬁnd the ﬁrst element with value 3    - no cbegin   cend   because later we modify the elements pos3 refers to auto pos3 = find  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,     range    value  3 ;     reverse the order of the found element with value 3 and all following elements reverse  pos3, coll.end   ;     print all elements for  auto elem : coll  { cout << elem << ’ ’;  } cout << endl;  }  To be able to call the algorithms, you must include the header ﬁle    some algorithms need special header ﬁles, see Section 11.1, page 505 :  include    The ﬁrst two algorithms, min_element   and max_element  , are called with two parameters that deﬁne the range of the processed elements. To process all elements of a container, you simply use cbegin   and cend   or begin   and end  , respectively. Both algorithms return an iterator for the position of the element found. Thus, in the statement  auto minpos = min_element coll.cbegin  ,coll.cend   ;   6.4 Algorithms  201  the min_element   algorithm returns the position of the minimum element.  If there is more than one minimum element, the algorithm returns the ﬁrst.  The next statement prints the element the iterator refers to:  cout << "min: " << *minpos << endl;  Of course, you could do both in one statement:  cout << *min_element coll.cbegin  ,coll.cend    << endl;  The next algorithm, sort  , as the name indicates, sorts the elements of the range deﬁned by the two arguments. As usual, you could pass an optional sorting criterion. The default sorting criterion is operator <. Thus, in this example, all elements of the container are sorted in ascending order:  sort  coll.begin  , coll.end   ;  Thus, afterward, the vector contains the elements in this order:  1 2 3 4 5 6  Note that you can’t use cbegin   and cend   here, because sort   modiﬁes the values of the elements, which is not possible for const_iterators.  The find   algorithm searches for a value inside the given range. In this example, this algorithm  searches for the ﬁrst element that is equal to the value 3 in the whole container:  auto pos3 = find  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  3 ;     range    value  If the find   algorithm is successful, it returns the iterator position of the element found. If the algorithm fails, it returns the end of the range passed as second argument, which is the past-the-end iterator of coll here. In this example, the value 3 is found as the third element, so afterward, pos3 refers to the third element of coll.  The last algorithm called in the example is reverse  , which reverses the elements of the passed range. Here, the third element that was found by the find   algorithm and the past-the-end iterator are passed as arguments:  reverse  pos3, coll.end   ;  This call reverses the order of the third element up to the last one. Because this is a modiﬁcation, we have to use a nonconstant iterator here, which explains why we called find   with begin   and end   instead of cbegin   and cend  . Otherwise, pos3 would be a const_iterator, which would result in an error when passing it to reverse  .  The output of the program is as follows: min: 1 max: 6 1 2 6 5 4 3  Note that a couple of features of C++11 are used in this example. If you have a platform that doesn’t support all features of C++11, the same program might look as follows:   202  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library     stl algo1old.cpp  include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {     create vector with elements from 1 to 6 in arbitrary order vector  coll; coll.push_back 2 ; coll.push_back 5 ; coll.push_back 4 ; coll.push_back 1 ; coll.push_back 6 ; coll.push_back 3 ;     ﬁnd and print minimum and maximum elements vector ::const_iterator minpos = min_element coll.begin  , coll.end   ;  cout << "min: " << *minpos << endl; vector ::const_iterator maxpos = max_element coll.begin  , coll.end   ;  cout << "max: " << *maxpos << endl;     sort all elements sort  coll.begin  , coll.end   ;     ﬁnd the ﬁrst element with value 3 vector ::iterator pos3; pos3 = find  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  3 ;     range    value     reverse the order of the found element with value 3 and all following elements reverse  pos3, coll.end   ;     print all elements vector ::const_iterator pos; for  pos=coll.begin  ; pos!=coll.end  ; ++pos  {  cout << *pos << ’ ’;  } cout << endl;  }   6.4 Algorithms  203  The differences are as follows:   No initializer list can be used to initialize the vector.   Members cbegin   and cend   are not provided, so you have to use begin   and end     Instead of using auto, you always have to declare the iterators explicitly.   Instead of range-based for loops, you have to use iterators to output each element.  instead. But you can still use const_iterators.  6.4.1 Ranges  All algorithms process one or more ranges of elements. Such a range might, but is not required to, embrace all elements of a container. Therefore, to be able to handle subsets of container elements, you pass the beginning and the end of the range as two separate arguments rather than the whole collection as one argument.  This interface is ﬂexible but dangerous. The caller must ensure that the ﬁrst and second argu- ments deﬁne a valid range. A range is valid if the end of the range is reachable from the beginning by iterating through the elements. This means that it is up to the programmer to ensure that both iterators belong to the same container and that the beginning is not behind the end. Otherwise, the behavior is undeﬁned, and endless loops or forbidden memory access may result. In this re- spect, iterators are just as unsafe as ordinary pointers. But undeﬁned behavior also means that an implementation of the STL is free to ﬁnd such kinds of errors and handle them accordingly. The following paragraphs show that ensuring that ranges are valid is not always as easy as it sounds. See Section 6.12, page 245, for more details about the pitfalls and safe versions of the STL.  Every algorithm processes half-open ranges. Thus, a range is deﬁned so that it includes the position used as the beginning of the range but excludes the position used as the end. This concept is often described by using the traditional mathematical notations for half-open ranges:  In this book, I use the ﬁrst alternative.  The half-open-range concept has the advantages that it is simple and avoids special handling for empty collections  see Section 6.3, page 189 . However, it also has some disadvantages. Consider the following example:  or  [begin,end   [begin,end[     stl find1.cpp  include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {  list  coll;   204  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library     insert elements from 20 to 40 for  int i=20; i<=40; ++i  {  coll.push_back i ;  }     ﬁnd position of element with value 3    - there is none, so pos3 gets coll.end   auto pos3 = find  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  3 ;     range    value     reverse the order of elements between found element and the end    - because pos3 is coll.end   it reverses an empty range reverse  pos3, coll.end   ;     ﬁnd positions of values 25 and 35 list ::iterator pos25, pos35; pos25 = find  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  pos35 = find  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  25 ;  35 ;     range    value    range    value     print the maximum of the corresponding range    - note: including pos25 but excluding pos35 cout << "max: " << *max_element  pos25, pos35  << endl;     process the elements including the last position cout << "max: " << *max_element  pos25, ++pos35  << endl;  }  In this example, the collection is initialized with integral values from 20 to 40. When the search for an element with the value 3 fails, find   returns the end of the processed range  coll.end   in this example  and assigns it to pos3. Using that return value as the beginning of the range in the following call of reverse   poses no problem, because it results in the following call:  reverse  coll.end  , coll.end   ;  This is simply a call to reverse an empty range. Thus, it is an operation that has no effect  a so-called “no-op” .  However, if find   is used to ﬁnd the ﬁrst and the last elements of a subset, you should consider that passing these iterator positions as a range will exclude the last element. So, the ﬁrst call of max_element    max_element  pos25, pos35   ﬁnds 34 and not 35:  max: 34   6.4 Algorithms  205  To process the last element, you have to pass the position that is one past the last element:  max_element  pos25, ++pos35   Doing this yields the correct result:  max: 35  Note that this example uses a list as the container. Thus, you must use operator ++ to get the position that is behind pos35. If you have random-access iterators, as with vectors and deques, you also could use the expression pos35 + 1 because random-access iterators allow iterator arithmetic  see Section 6.3.2, page 198, and Section 9.2.5, page 438, for details .  Of course, you could use pos25 and pos35 to ﬁnd something in that subrange. Again, to search  including pos35, you have to pass the position after pos35. For example:     increment pos35 to search with its value included ++pos35; pos30 = find pos25,pos35,     range    value  30 ;  if  pos30 == pos35  {  cout << "30 is NOT in the subrange" << endl;  cout << "30 is in the subrange" << endl;  } else {  }  All the examples in this section work only because you know that pos25 is in front of pos35. Otherwise, [pos25,pos35  would not be a valid range. If you are not sure which element is in front, things get more complicated, and undeﬁned behavior may easily occur.  Suppose that you don’t know whether the element having value 25 is in front of the element having value 35. It might even be possible that one or both values are not present. By using random- access iterators, you can call operator < to check this:  if  pos25 < pos35  {     only [pos25,pos35  is valid ...  } else if  pos35 < pos25  {     only [pos35,pos25  is valid ...  } else {  }     both are equal, so both must be end   ...  However, without random-access iterators, you have no simple, fast way to ﬁnd out which iterator is in front. You can only search for one iterator in the range of the beginning to the other iterator or in the range of the other iterator to the end. In this case, you should change your algorithm as   206  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library  follows: Instead of searching for both values in the whole source range, you should try to ﬁnd out, while searching for them, which value comes ﬁrst. For example:  pos25 = find  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  pos35 = find  coll.begin  , pos25,  25 ;  35 ;  if  pos25 != coll.end   && pos35 != pos25  {     pos35 is in front of pos25    so, only [pos35,pos25  is valid ...  } else {  pos35 = find  pos25, coll.end  ,  35 ;  if  pos35 != coll.end    {    pos25 is in front of pos35    so, only [pos25,pos35  is valid ...     range    value    range    value     range    value  } else {  }  }     25 and or 35 not found ...  In contrast to the previous version, you don’t search for 35 in the full range of all elements of coll. Instead, you ﬁrst search for it from the beginning to pos25. Then, if it’s not found, you search for it in the part that contains the remaining elements after pos25. As a result, you know which iterator position comes ﬁrst and which subrange is valid.  This implementation is not very efﬁcient. A more efﬁcient way to ﬁnd the ﬁrst element that has either value 25 or value 35 is to search exactly for that. You could do this by using find_if   and passing a lambda  see Section 3.1.10, page 28 , deﬁning the criterion that is evaluated with each element in coll:  pos = find_if  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  []  int i  {  } ;  return i == 25  i == 35;     range    criterion  if  pos == coll.end    {     no element with value 25 or 35 found ...  } else if  *pos == 25  {   6.4 Algorithms  207     element with value 25 comes ﬁrst pos25 = pos; pos35 = find  ++pos, coll.end  ,  35 ;  25 ;     element with value 35 comes ﬁrst pos35 = pos; pos25 = find  ++pos, coll.end  ,     range    value     range    value  Here, the special lambda expression  []  int i  {  return i == 25  i == 35;  is used as a criterion that allows a search of the ﬁrst element that has either value 25 or value 35. The use of lambdas in the STL is introduced in Section 6.9, page 229, and discussed in detail in Section 10.3, page 499.  6.4.2 Handling Multiple Ranges  Several algorithms process more than one range. In this case, you usually must deﬁne both the beginning and the end only for the ﬁrst range. For all other ranges, you need to pass only their beginnings. The ends of the other ranges follow from the number of elements in the ﬁrst range. For example, the following call of equal   compares all elements of the collection coll1 element-by- element with the elements of coll2, beginning with its ﬁrst element:    ﬁrst range    second range  if  equal  coll1.begin  , coll1.end  ,  coll2.begin     {  Thus, the number of elements of coll2 that are compared with the elements of coll1 is speciﬁed indirectly by the number of elements in coll1  see Figure 6.9 .  This leads to an important consequence: When you call algorithms for multiple ranges, make sure that the second and additional ranges have at least as many elements as the ﬁrst range. In particular, make sure that destination ranges are big enough for algorithms that write to collections.  ...  } else {  ...  }  }  ...  }   208  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library  number of elements to process   coll1.begin     coll2.begin     ++   coll1.end     ...   Figure6.9. AlgorithmIteratingoverTwoRanges  Consider the following program:     stl copybug.cpp  include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {  list  vector  coll2;  coll1 = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 };     RUNTIME ERROR:    - overwrites nonexisting elements in the destination copy  coll1.cbegin  , coll1.cend  ,  coll2.begin   ;     source    destination  ...  }  Here, the copy   algorithm is called. It simply copies all elements of the ﬁrst range into the desti- nation range. As usual, the beginning and the end are deﬁned for the ﬁrst range, whereas only the beginning is speciﬁed for the second range. However, the algorithm overwrites rather than inserts. So, the algorithm requires that the destination has enough elements to be overwritten. If there is not enough room, as in this case, the result is undeﬁned behavior. In practice, this often means that you overwrite whatever comes after the coll2.end  . If you’re in luck, you’ll get a crash, so at least you’ll know that you did something wrong. However, you can force your luck by using a safe version of the STL for which the undeﬁned behavior is deﬁned as leading to a certain error-handling procedure  see Section 6.12.1, page 247 .   6.4 Algorithms  209  To avoid these errors, you can  1  ensure that the destination has enough elements on entry, or  2  use insert iterators. Insert iterators are covered in Section 6.5.1, page 210. I’ll ﬁrst explain how to modify the destination so that it is big enough on entry.  To make the destination big enough, you must either create it with the correct size or change its size explicitly. Both alternatives apply only to some sequence containers  vector, deque, list, and forward_list . However, this is not really a problem for other containers, because associative and unordered containers cannot be used as a destination for overwriting algorithms  Section 6.7.2, page 221, explains why . The following program shows how to increase the size of containers:     stl copy1.cpp  include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {  list  vector  coll2;  coll1 = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 };     resize destination to have enough room for the overwriting algorithm coll2.resize  coll1.size   ;     copy elements from ﬁrst into second collection    - overwrites existing elements in destination copy  coll1.cbegin  , coll1.cend  ,  coll2.begin   ;     source    destination     create third collection with enough room    - initial size is passed as parameter deque  coll3 coll1.size   ;     copy elements from ﬁrst into third collection copy  coll1.cbegin  , coll1.cend  ,  coll3.begin   ;     source    destination  }  Here, resize   is used to change the number of elements in the existing container coll2:  coll2.resize  coll1.size   ;   210  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library  Later, coll3 is initialized with a special initial size so that it has enough room for all elements of coll1:  deque  coll3 coll1.size   ;  Note that both resizing and initializing the size create new elements. These elements are initialized by their default constructor because no arguments are passed to them. You can pass an additional argument both for the constructor and for resize   to initialize the new elements.  6.5 Iterator Adapters  Iterators are pure abstractions: Anything that behaves like an iterator is an iterator. For this reason, you can write classes that have the interface of iterators but do something completely different. The C++ standard library provides several predeﬁned special iterators: iterator adapters. They are more than auxiliary classes; they give the whole concept a lot more power.  The following subsections introduce the following iterator adapters: 1. Insert iterators 2. Stream iterators 3. Reverse iterators 4. Move iterators  since C++11  Section 9.4, page 448, covers them in detail.  6.5.1 Insert Iterators  Insert iterators, or inserters, are used to let algorithms operate in insert mode rather than in overwrite mode. In particular, inserters solve the problem of algorithms that write to a destination that does not have enough room: They let the destination grow accordingly.   If you assign a value to their element, they insert that value into the collection to which they belong. Three different insert iterators have different abilities with regard to where the elements are inserted — at the front, at the end, or at a given position.  Insert iterators redeﬁne their interface internally as follows:    A call to step forward is a no-op. With this interface, they fall under the category of output iterators, which are able to write assign values only while iterating forward  see Section 9.2, page 433, for details of iterator categories .  Consider the following example:     stl copy2.cpp  include   include   include   include   include     6.5 Iterator Adapters  211  include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {  list  coll1 = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 };     copy the elements of coll1 into coll2 by appending them vector  coll2; copy  coll1.cbegin  , coll1.cend  ,  back_inserter coll2  ;     source    destination     copy the elements of coll1 into coll3 by inserting them at the front    - reverses the order of the elements deque  coll3; copy  coll1.cbegin  , coll1.cend  ,     source    destination  front_inserter coll3  ;     copy elements of coll1 into coll4    - only inserter that works for associative collections set  coll4; copy  coll1.cbegin  , coll1.cend  ,  inserter coll4,coll4.begin    ;     source    destination  }  This example uses all three predeﬁned insert iterators: 1. Back inserters insert the elements at the back of their container  appends them  by calling push_back  . For example, with the following statement, all elements of coll1 are appended into coll2:  copy  coll1.cbegin  , coll1.cend  ,  back_inserter coll2  ;     source    destination  Of course, back inserters can be used only for containers that provide push_back   as a member function. In the C++ standard library, these containers are vector, deque, list, and strings.  2. Front inserters insert the elements at the front of their container by calling push_front  . For  example, with the following statement, all elements of coll1 are inserted into coll3:  copy  coll1.cbegin  , coll1.cend  ,  front_inserter coll3  ;     source    destination  Note that this kind of insertion reverses the order of the inserted elements. If you insert 1 at the front and then 2 at the front, the 1 is after the 2.  Front inserters can be used only for containers that provide push_front   as a member  function. In the C++ standard library, these containers are deque, list, and forward_list.   212  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library  3. General inserters, or simply inserters, insert elements directly in front of the position that is passed as the second argument of its initialization. A general inserter calls the insert   mem- ber function with the new value and the new position as arguments. Note that all predeﬁned containers except array and forward_list have such an insert   member function. Thus, this is the only predeﬁned inserter for associative and unordered containers.  But wait a moment. Passing a position to insert a new element doesn’t sound useful for as- sociative and unordered containers, does it? Within associative containers, the position depends on the value of the elements, and in unordered containers the position of an element is unde- ﬁned. The solution is simple: For associative and unordered containers, the position is taken as a hint to start the search for the correct position. However, the containers are free to ignore it. Section 9.6, page 471, describes a user-deﬁned inserter that is more useful for associative and unordered containers.  Table 6.1 lists the functionality of insert iterators. Additional details are described in Section 9.4.2, page 454.  Expression back_inserter container  front_inserter container  inserter container,pos   Kind of Inserter Appends in the same order by using push_back val  Inserts at the front in reverse order by using push_front val  Inserts at pos  in the same order  by using insert pos,val   Table6.1. PredeﬁnedInsertIterators  6.5.2 Stream Iterators  Stream iterators read from or write to a stream.9 Thus, they provide an abstraction that lets the input from the keyboard behave as a collection from which you can read. Similarly, you can redirect the output of an algorithm directly into a ﬁle or onto the screen.  The following example is typical for the power of the whole STL. Compared with ordinary C or  C++, the example does a lot of complex processing by using only a few statements:     stl ioiter1.cpp  include   include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  9 A stream is an object that represents I O channels  see Chapter 15 .   6.5 Iterator Adapters  213  int main   {  vector  coll;     read all words from the standard input    - source: all strings until end-of-ﬁle  or error     - destination: coll  inserting  copy  istream_iterator  cin ,  istream_iterator   , back_inserter coll  ;     sort elements sort  coll.begin  , coll.end   ;     start of source    end of source    destination     print all elements without duplicates    - source: coll    - destination: standard output  with newline between elements  unique_copy  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,     source  ostream_iterator  cout,"\n"  ;    destination  }  The program has only three statements that read all words from the standard input and print a sorted list of them. Let’s consider the three statements step-by-step. In the statement  copy  istream_iterator  cin ,  istream_iterator   , back_inserter coll  ;  two input stream iterators are used: 1. The expression  istream_iterator  cin   creates a stream iterator that reads from the standard input stream cin. The template argument string speciﬁes that the stream iterator reads elements of this type  string types are covered in Chapter 13 . These elements are read with the usual input operator >>. Thus, each time the algorithm wants to process the next element, the istream iterator transforms that desire into a call of  cin >> string  The input operator for strings usually reads one word separated by whitespaces  see Section 13.2.10, page 677 , so the algorithm reads word by word.  2. The expression  istream_iterator     calls the default constructor of istream iterators that creates a so-called end-of-stream iterator. It represents a stream from which you can no longer read.   214  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library  As usual, the copy   algorithm operates as long as the  incremented  ﬁrst argument differs from the second argument. The end-of-stream iterator is used as the end of the range, so the algorithm reads all strings from cin until it can no longer read any more  owing to end-of-stream or an error . To summarize, the source of the algorithm is “all words read from cin.” These words are copied by inserting them into coll with the help of a back inserter.  The sort   algorithm sorts all elements: sort  coll.begin  , coll.end   ;  Finally, the statement  unique_copy  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  ostream_iterator  cout,"\n"  ;  copies all elements from the collection into the destination cout. During this process, unique_copy   algorithm eliminates adjacent duplicate values. The expression  the  ostream_iterator  cout,"\n"   creates an output stream iterator that writes strings to cout by calling operator << for each element. The second argument behind cout is optional and serves as a separator between the elements. In this example, it is a newline character, so every element is written on a separate line.  All components of the program are templates, so you can change the program easily to sort other value types, such as integers or more complex objects. Section 9.4.3, page 460, explains more and gives more examples about iostream iterators.  In this example, one declaration and three statements were used to sort all words read from standard input. However, you could do the same by using only one declaration and one statement. See Section 1, page 394, for an example.  6.5.3 Reverse Iterators  Reverse iterators let algorithms operate backward by switching the call of an increment operator internally into a call of the decrement operator, and vice versa. All containers with bidirectional iterators or random-access iterators  all sequence containers except forward_list and all asso- ciative containers  can create reverse iterators via their member functions rbegin   and rend  . Since C++11, the corresponding member functions returning read-only iterators, crbegin   and crend  , are also provided.  For forward_lists and unordered containers, no backward-iteration interface  rbegin  , rend  , etc.  is provided. The reason is that the implementation requires only singly linked lists to go through the elements.   6.5 Iterator Adapters  215  Consider the following example:     stl reviter1.cpp  include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {  vector  coll;     insert elements from 1 to 9 for  int i=1; i<=9; ++i  {  coll.push_back i ;  }     print all element in reverse order copy  coll.crbegin  , coll.crend  ,  ostream_iterator  cout," "  ;     source    destination  cout << endl;  }  coll.crbegin    *coll.crbegin    coll.crend    The following expression returns a read-only reverse iterator for coll:  This iterator may be used as the beginning of a reverse iteration over the elements of the collection. The iterator’s position is the last element of the collection. Thus, the following expression returns the value of the last element:  Accordingly, the following expression returns for coll a reverse iterator that may be used as the end of a reverse iteration.  As usual for ranges, the iterator’s position is past the end of the range but from the opposite direction; that is, it is the position before the ﬁrst element in the collection.  Again, you should never use operator *  or operator ->  for a position that does not represent a  valid element. Thus, the expression  *coll.crend    is as undeﬁned as *coll.end   or *coll.cend  .  The advantage of using reverse iterators is that all algorithms are able to operate in the opposite direction without special code. A step to the next element with operator ++ is redeﬁned into a step   216  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library  backward with operator --. For example, in this case, copy   iterates over the elements of coll from the last to the ﬁrst element. So, the output of the program is as follows:  9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1  You can also switch “normal” iterators into reverse iterators, and vice versa. However, the referenced value of an iterator changes in doing so. This and other details about reverse iterators are covered in Section 9.4.1, page 448.  6.5.4 Move Iterators  Move iterators are provided since C++11. They convert any access to the underlying element into a move operation. As a result, they allow moving elements from one container into another either in constructors or while applying algorithms. See Section 9.4.4, page 466, for details.  6.6 User-Deﬁned Generic Functions  The STL is an extensible framework. This means you can write your own functions and algorithms to process elements of collections. Of course, these operations may also be generic. However, to declare a valid iterator in these operations, you must use the type of the container, which is different for each container type. To facilitate the writing of generic functions, each container type provides some internal type deﬁnitions. Consider the following example:     stl print.hpp  include   include       PRINT_ELEMENTS      - prints optional string optstr followed by    - all elements of the collection coll    - in one line, separated by spaces template   inline void PRINT_ELEMENTS  const T& coll,  {  }  std::cout << optstr; for  const auto&  elem : coll  {  std::cout << elem << ’ ’;  } std::cout << std::endl;  const std::string& optstr=""    6.7 Manipulating Algorithms  217  This example deﬁnes a generic function that prints an optional string followed by all elements of the passed container.  Before C++11, the loop over the elements had to look as follows: typename T::const_iterator pos; for  pos=coll.begin  ; pos!=coll.end  ; ++pos  {  std::cout << *pos << ’ ’;  }  Here, pos is declared as having the iterator type of the passed container type. Note that typename is necessary here to specify that const_iterator is a type and not a static member of type T  see the introduction of typename in Section 3.2, page 34 .  In addition to iterator and const_iterator, containers provide other types to facilitate the writing of generic functions. For example, they provide the type of the elements to enable the handling of temporary copies of elements. See Section 9.5.1, page 468, for details.  The optional second argument of PRINT_ELEMENTS is a string that is used as a preﬁx before all elements are written. Thus, by using PRINT_ELEMENTS  , you could comment or introduce the output like this:  PRINT_ELEMENTS  coll, "all elements: " ;  I introduced this function here because I use it often in the rest of the book to print all elements of containers by using a simple call.  6.7 Manipulating Algorithms  So far, I have introduced the whole concept of the STL as a framework: Containers represent dif- ferent concepts to manage collections of data. Algorithms are provided to perform read and write operations on these collections. Iterators are the glue between containers and algorithms. Provided by the containers, iterators allow you to iterate over all elements in different orders and in special modes, such as an appending mode.  Now, however, it’s time for the “BUT” of the STL framework: In practice, there are some limits  and workarounds you should know. Many of these have to do with modiﬁcations.  Several algorithms modify destination ranges. In particular, those algorithms may remove ele- ments. If this happens, special aspects apply, which are explained in this section. These aspects are surprising and show the price of the STL concept that separates containers and algorithms with great ﬂexibility.   218  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library  6.7.1 “Removing” Elements  The remove   algorithm removes elements from a range. However, using this algorithm for all elements of a container operates in a surprising way. Consider the following example:     stl remove1.cpp  include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {  list  coll;     insert elements from 6 to 1 and 1 to 6 for  int i=1; i<=6; ++i  {  coll.push_front i ; coll.push_back i ;  }     print all elements of the collection cout << "pre: copy  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  ";  ostream_iterator  cout," "  ;  cout << endl;     source    destination     remove all elements with value 3 remove  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  3 ;     range    value     print all elements of the collection cout << "post: "; copy  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  ostream_iterator  cout," "  ;     source    destination  cout << endl;  }  Someone without deeper knowledge reading this program would expect that all elements with value 3 are removed from the collection. However, the output of the program is as follows:  pre: 6 5 4 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 post: 6 5 4 2 1 1 2 4 5 6 5 6   6.7 Manipulating Algorithms  219  Thus, remove   did not change the number of elements in the collection for which it was called. The cend   member function returns the old end — as would end   — whereas size   returns the old number of elements. However, something has changed: The elements changed their order as if the elements had been removed. Each element with value 3 was overwritten by the following elements  see Figure 6.10 . At the end of the collection, the old elements that were not overwritten by the algorithm remain unchanged. Logically, these elements no longer belong to the collection.  Figure6.10. Howremove   Operates  However, the algorithm does return the new logical end. By using the algorithm, you can access the resulting range, reduce the size of the collection, or process the number of removed elements. Consider the following modiﬁed version of the example:     stl remove2.cpp  include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {  list  coll;     insert elements from 6 to 1 and 1 to 6 for  int i=1; i<=6; ++i  {  coll.push_front i ; coll.push_back i ;  }     print all elements of the collection copy  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  ostream_iterator  cout," "  ;  cout << endl;     remove all elements with value 3    - retain new end   cid:2   cid:3   cid:4   cid:5   cid:6   cid:7   cid:7   cid:6   cid:5   cid:4   cid:3   cid:2   220  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library  list ::iterator end = remove  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  3 ;     print resulting elements of the collection copy  coll.begin  , end,  ostream_iterator  cout," "  ;  cout << endl;     print number of removed elements cout << "number of removed elements: "  << distance end,coll.end    << endl;     remove ‘‘removed’’ elements coll.erase  end, coll.end   ;     print all elements of the modiﬁed collection copy  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  ostream_iterator  cout," "  ;  cout << endl;  }  In this version, the return value of remove   is assigned to the iterator end:  list ::iterator end = remove  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  3 ;  This is the new logical end of the modiﬁed collection after the elements are “removed.” You can use this return value as the new end for further operations:  copy  coll.begin  , end,  ostream_iterator  cout," "  ;  Note that you have to use begin   here rather than cbegin   because end is deﬁned a nonconstant iterator, and the begin and end of a range have to get speciﬁed by the same types.  Another possibility is to process the number of “removed” elements by processing the distance  between the “logical” and the real end of the collection:  cout << "number of removed elements: "  << distance end,coll.end    << endl;  Here, a special auxiliary function for iterators, distance  , is used. It returns the distance between two iterators. If the iterators were random-access iterators, you could process the difference directly with operator -. However, the container is a list, so it provides only bidirectional iterators. See Section 9.3.3, page 445, for details about distance  .  If you really want to remove the “removed” elements, you must call an appropriate member function of the container. To do this, containers provide the erase   member function, which removes all elements of the range that is speciﬁed by its arguments:  coll.erase  end, coll.end   ;   6.7 Manipulating Algorithms  221  Here is the output of the whole program:  6 5 4 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 5 4 2 1 1 2 4 5 6 number of removed elements: 2 6 5 4 2 1 1 2 4 5 6  3 ,  coll.end   ;  If you really want to remove elements in one statement, you can call the following statement:  coll.erase  remove coll.begin  ,coll.end  ,  Why don’t algorithms call erase   by themselves? This question highlights the price of the ﬂexibil- ity of the STL. The STL separates data structures and algorithms by using iterators as the interface. However, iterators are an abstraction to represent a position in a container. In general, iterators do not know their containers. Thus, the algorithms, which use the iterators to access the elements of the container, can’t call any member function for it.  This design has important consequences because it allows algorithms to operate on ranges that are different from “all elements of a container.” For example, the range might be a subset of all elements of a collection. The range might even be a container that provides no erase   member function  an array is an example of such a container . So, to make algorithms as ﬂexible as possible, there are good reasons not to require that iterators know their container.  Note that often it is not necessary to remove the “removed” elements. Often, it is no problem to use the returned new logical end instead of the real end of the container. In particular, you can call all algorithms with the new logical end.  6.7.2 Manipulating Associative and Unordered Containers  Manipulation algorithms — those that remove elements and those that reorder or modify elements — have another problem when you try to use them with associative or unordered containers: Associative and unordered containers can’t be used as a destination. The reason is simple: If they would work for associative or unordered containers, modifying algorithms could change the value or position of elements, thereby violating the order maintained by the container  sorted for associative containers or according to the hash function for unordered containers . In order to avoid compromising the internal order, every iterator for an associative and unordered container is declared as an iterator for a constant value or key. Thus, manipulating elements of or in associative and unordered containers results in a failure at compile time. 10  This problem also prevents you from calling removing algorithms for associative containers, because these algorithms manipulate elements implicitly. The values of “removed” elements are overwritten by the following elements that are not removed.  Now the question arises: How does one remove elements in associative containers? Well, the answer is simple: Call their member functions! Every associative and unordered container provides  10 Unfortunately, some systems provide really bad error handling. You see that something went wrong but have problems ﬁnding out why.   222  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library  member functions to remove elements. For example, you can call the member function erase   to remove elements:     stl remove3.cpp  include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {     unordered set with elements from 1 to 9 set  coll = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 };     print all elements of the collection copy  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  ostream_iterator  cout," "  ;  cout << endl;     Remove all elements with value 3    - algorithm remove   does not work    - instead member function erase   works int num = coll.erase 3 ;     print number of removed elements cout << "number of removed elements: " << num << endl;     print all elements of the modiﬁed collection copy  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  ostream_iterator  cout," "  ;  cout << endl;  }  Note that containers provide different erase   member functions. Only the form that gets the value of the element s  to remove as a single argument returns the number of removed elements  see Section 8.7.3, page 418 . Of course, when duplicates are not allowed, the return value can only be 0 or 1, as is the case for sets, maps, unordered_sets, and unordered_maps.  The output of the program is as follows: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 number of removed elements: 1 1 2 4 5 6 7 8 9   6.7 Manipulating Algorithms  223  6.7.3 Algorithms versus Member Functions  Even if you are able to use an algorithm, it might be a bad idea to do so. A container might have member functions that provide much better performance.  Calling remove   for elements of a list is a good example of this. If you call remove   for elements of a list, the algorithm doesn’t know that it is operating on a list and thus does what it does for any container: reorder the elements by changing their values. If, for example, the algorithm removes the ﬁrst element, all the following elements are assigned to their previous elements. This behavior contradicts the main advantage of lists: the ability to insert, move, and remove elements by modifying the links instead of the values.  To avoid bad performance, lists provide special member functions for all manipulating algo- rithms. You should always prefer them. Furthermore, these member functions really remove “re- moved” elements, as this example shows:     stl remove4.cpp  include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {  list  coll;     insert elements from 6 to 1 and 1 to 6 for  int i=1; i<=6; ++i  {  coll.push_front i ; coll.push_back i ;  }     remove all elements with value 3  poor performance  coll.erase  remove coll.begin  ,coll.end  ,  3 ,  coll.end   ;     remove all elements with value 4  good performance  coll.remove  4 ;  }  You should always prefer a member function over an algorithm if good performance is the goal. The problem is, you have to know that a member function exists that has signiﬁcantly better performance for a certain container. No warning or error message appears if you use the remove   algorithm for a list. However, if you prefer a member function in these cases, you have to change the code when you switch to another container type. In the reference sections of algorithms  Chapter 11 , I mention whether a member function exists that provides better performance than an algorithm.   224  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library  6.8 Functions as Algorithm Arguments  To increase their ﬂexibility and power, several algorithms allow the passing of user-deﬁned auxiliary functions. These functions are called internally by the algorithms.  6.8.1 Using Functions as Algorithm Arguments  The simplest example is the for_each   algorithm, which calls a user-deﬁned function for each element of the speciﬁed range. Consider the following example:     stl foreach1.cpp  include   include   include   using namespace std;     function that prints the passed argument void print  int elem  {  cout << elem << ’ ’;  int main   {  vector  coll;     insert elements from 1 to 9 for  int i=1; i<=9; ++i  {  coll.push_back i ;  }  }  }     print all elements for_each  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  print ;  cout << endl;     range    operation  The for_each   algorithm calls the passed print   function for every element in the range [coll.cbegin  ,coll.cend   . Thus, the output of the program is as follows:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   6.8 Functions as Algorithm Arguments  225  Algorithms use auxiliary functions in several variants: some optional, some mandatory. In particular, you can use auxiliary functions to specify a search criterion or a sorting criterion or to deﬁne a manipulation while transferring elements from one collection to another.  Here is another example program:     stl transform1.cpp  include   include   include   include   include   include "print.hpp"  int square  int value  {  return value*value;  int main   {  std::set  coll1; std::vector  coll2;  }  }     insert elements from 1 to 9 into coll1 for  int i=1; i<=9; ++i  {  coll1.insert i ;  } PRINT_ELEMENTS coll1,"initialized: " ;     transform each element from coll1 to coll2    - square transformed values std::transform  coll1.cbegin  ,coll1.cend  ,  std::back_inserter coll2 , square ;     source    destination    operation  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll2,"squared:  " ;  In this example, square   is used to square each element of coll1 while it is transformed to coll2  Figure 6.11 . The program has the following output:  initialized: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 squared:  1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81   226  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library  Figure6.11. How transform   Operates  6.8.2 Predicates  A predicate is a special kind of auxiliary function. Predicates return a Boolean value and are often used to specify a sorting or a search criterion. Depending on their purpose, predicates are unary or binary.  Not every unary or binary function that returns a Boolean value is a valid predicate. In addition, the STL requires that predicates be stateless, meaning that they should always yield the same result for the same value. This rules out functions that modify their internal state when they are called. See Section 10.1.4, page 483, for details.  Unary Predicates  Unary predicates check a speciﬁc property of a single argument. A typical example is a function that is used as a search criterion to ﬁnd the ﬁrst prime number:     stl prime1.cpp  include   include   include   include   using namespace std;     for abs       predicate, which returns whether an integer is a prime number bool isPrime  int number  {     ignore negative sign number = abs number ;     0 and 1 are no prime numbers if  number == 0  number == 1  {   cid:2   cid:3   cid:4   cid:4   cid:5   cid:6   cid:7   cid:8   cid:9   cid:10   cid:11   cid:3   cid:7   cid:12   cid:13   cid:14   cid:7   cid:5   cid:8   cid:9   cid:6   cid:5   cid:3   cid:9   cid:2   cid:3   cid:4   cid:4   cid:15   cid:7   cid:5   cid:8   cid:9   cid:6   cid:5   cid:3   cid:9   cid:16   cid:9   cid:6   cid:17   cid:10   cid:18   cid:19   cid:8   cid:7   cid:20   cid:17   cid:13   cid:16   cid:9   cid:6   cid:17   cid:21   cid:8   cid:4   cid:19   cid:20   cid:14   cid:22   cid:17   cid:17   cid:17   cid:17   cid:7   cid:20   cid:6   cid:19   cid:7   cid:9   cid:17   cid:21   cid:8   cid:4   cid:19   cid:20   cid:23   cid:21   cid:8   cid:4   cid:19   cid:20   cid:24   cid:25   6.8 Functions as Algorithm Arguments  227  return false;     ﬁnd divisor that divides without a remainder int divisor; for  divisor = number 2; number%divisor != 0; --divisor  {  ;     if no divisor greater than 1 is found, it is a prime number return divisor == 1;  }  int main   {  list  coll;     insert elements from 24 to 30 for  int i=24; i<=30; ++i  {  coll.push_back i ;  }  }  }     search for prime number auto pos = find_if  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  if  pos != coll.end    {  isPrime ;     range    predicate     found cout << *pos << " is first prime number found" << endl;  } else {  }  }     not found cout << "no prime number found" << endl;  In this example, the find_if   algorithm is used to search for the ﬁrst element of the given range for which the passed unary predicate yields true. Here, the predicate is the isPrime   function, which checks whether a number is a prime number. By using this predicate, the algorithm returns the ﬁrst prime number in the given range. If it does not ﬁnd any element that matches the predicate, the algorithm returns the end of the range  its second argument . This is checked after the call. The collection in this example has a prime number between 24 and 30, so the output of the program is as follows:  29 is first prime number found   228  Binary Predicates  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library  Binary predicates typically compare a speciﬁc property of two arguments. For example, to sort elements according to your own criterion, you could provide it as a simple predicate function. This might be necessary because the elements do not provide operator < or because you wish to use a different criterion.  The following example sorts elements of a deque by the ﬁrst name and last name of a person:     stl sort1.cpp  include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  class Person {  public:  string firstname   const; string lastname   const; ...  };     binary function predicate:    - returns whether a person is less than another person bool personSortCriterion  const Person& p1, const Person& p2  {     a person is less than another person    - if the last name is less    - if the last name is equal and the ﬁrst name is less return p1.lastname  <p2.lastname      p1.lastname  ==p2.lastname   && p1.firstname  <p2.firstname   ;  }  int main   {  ...  }  deque  coll; ...  sort coll.begin  ,coll.end  ,  personSortCriterion ;     range    sort criterion   6.9 Using Lambdas  229  Note that you can also implement a sorting criterion as a function object. This kind of implementa- tion has the advantage that the criterion is a type, which you could use, for example, to declare sets that use this criterion for sorting its elements. See Section 10.1.1, page 476, for such an implemen- tation of this sorting criterion.  6.9 Using Lambdas  Lambdas, introduced with C++11, deﬁne a way to specify functional behavior inside an expression or statement  see Section 3.1.10, page 28 . As a consequence, you can deﬁne objects that represent functional behavior and pass these objects as inline argument to algorithms to be used as predicates or for other purposes.  For example, in the following statement:    transform all elements to the power of 3 std::transform  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  coll.begin  , [] double d  {  return d*d*d;  } ;  the expression  [] double d  { return d*d*d; }     source    destination    lambda as function object  deﬁnes a lambda expression, which represents a function object that returns a double raised to the power of 3. As you can see, this provides the ability to specify the functional behavior passed to transform   directly where it is called.  The Beneﬁt of Lambdas  Using lambdas to specify behavior inside the STL framework solves a lot of drawbacks of previous attempts. Suppose that you search in a collection for the ﬁrst element with a value that is between x and y:     stl lambda1.cpp  include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {  deque  coll = { 1, 3, 19, 5, 13, 7, 11, 2, 17 };   230  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library  int x = 5; int y = 12; auto pos = find_if  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  [=] int i  {  return i > x && i < y;  } ;     range    search criterion  cout  5 and <12: " << *pos << endl;  }  }  When calling find_if  , you pass the corresponding predicate inline as the third argument:  auto pos = find_if  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  [=] int i  {  return i > x && i < y;  } ;  The lambda is just a function object taking an integer i and returning whether it is greater than x and less than y:  [=] int i  {  return i > x && i < y;  By specifying = as a capture inside [=], you pass the symbols, which are valid where the lambda gets declared, by value into the body of the lambda. Thus, inside the lambda, you have read access to the variables x and y declared in main  . With [&], you could even pass the values by reference so that inside the lambda, you could modify their values  see Section 3.1.10, page 29, for more details about captures .  Now compare this way to search for “the ﬁrst element >5 and <12” with the other approaches  provided by C++ before lambdas were introduced:   In contrast to using handwritten loops:     ﬁnd ﬁrst element > x and < y vector ::iterator pos; for  pos = coll.begin   ; pos != coll.end  ; ++pos  {  if  *pos > x && *pos < y  {  break;    the loop  you beneﬁt from using predeﬁned algorithms and avoid a more or less ugly break.    In contrast to using a self-written function predicate:  }  }  } ...  bool pred  int i  {  return i > x && i < y;   6.9 Using Lambdas  231  pos = find_if  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  pred ;     range    search criterion  you don’t have the problem that the details of the behavior are written somewhere else and you have to scroll up to ﬁnd out what find_if   exactly is looking for, unless you have and trust a corresponding comment. In addition, C++ compilers optimize lambdas better than they do ordinary functions.  What’s more, access to x and y becomes really ugly in this scenario. The usual solution before C++11 to use a function object  see Section 6.10, page 233  demonstrates the whole ugliness of this approach:  class Pred {  private: int x; int y;  public:  Pred  int xx, int yy  : x xx , y yy  { } bool operator    int i  const {  return i > x && i < y;  }  }; ... pos = find_if  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,    In contrast to using binders  introduced in Section 6.10.3, page 241 :  Pred x,y  ;  pos = find_if  coll.begin  , coll.end  , bind logical_and   ,     range    search criterion     range    search criterion  bind greater   ,_1,x , bind less   ,_1,y   ;  you don’t have problems understanding the expression deﬁned here.  To summarize, lambdas provide the ﬁrst convenient, readable, fast, and maintainable approach to use STL algorithms.  Using Lambdas as Sorting Criterion  As another example, let’s use a lambda expression to deﬁne the criterion when sorting a vector of Persons  see Section 6.8.2, page 228, for a corresponding program that uses a function to deﬁne the sorting criterion :     stl sort2.cpp  include   include     232  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library  include   include   using namespace std;  class Person {  public:  string firstname   const; string lastname   const; ...  };  int main   {  deque  coll; ...     sort Persons according to lastname  and ﬁrstname : sort coll.begin  ,coll.end  ,     range  []  const Person& p1, const Person& p2  {    sort criterion  return p1.lastname  <p2.lastname      p1.lastname  ==p2.lastname   && p1.firstname  <p2.firstname   ;  } ;  ...  }  Limits of Lambdas  However, lambdas are not better in every case. Consider, for example, using a lambda to specify the sorting criterion for associative containers:  auto cmp = []  const Person&  p1, const Person&  p2  {  return p1.lastname  <p2.lastname     p1.lastname  ==p2.lastname  &&  p1.firstname  <p2.firstname   ;  };  ... std::set  coll cmp ;  Because you need the type of the lambda for the declaration of the set, decltype  see Sec- tion 3.1.11, page 32  must be used, which yields the type of a lambda object, such as cmp. Note that you also have to pass the lambda object to the constructor of coll; otherwise, coll would call the default constructor for the sorting criterion passed, and by rule lambdas have no default construc-   6.10 Function Objects  233  tor and no assignment operator.11 So, for a sorting criterion, a class deﬁning the function objects might still be more intuitive.  Another problem of lambdas is that they can’t have an internal state held over multiple calls of a lambda. If you need such a state, you have declare an object or variable in the outer scope and pass it by-reference with a capture into the lambda. In contrast, function objects allow you to encapsulate an internal state  see Section 10.3.2, page 500, for more details and examples .  Nevertheless, you can also use lambdas to specify a hash function and or equivalence criterion  of unordered containers. See Section 7.9.7, page 379, for an example.  6.10 Function Objects  Functional arguments for algorithms don’t have to be functions. As seen with lambdas, functional arguments can be objects that behave like functions. Such an object is called a function object, or functor.12 Instead of using a lambda, you can deﬁne a function object as an object of a class that provides a function call operator. This was possible even before C++11.  6.10.1 Deﬁnition of Function Objects  Function objects are another example of the power of generic programming and the concept of pure abstraction. You could say that anything that behaves like a function is a function. So, if you deﬁne an object that behaves as a function, it can be used like a function.  So, what is the behavior of a function? A functional behavior is something that you can call by  using parentheses and passing arguments. For example:  function arg1,arg2 ;     a function call  If you want objects to behave this way, you have to make it possible to “call” them by using paren- theses and passing arguments. Yes, that’s possible  rarely are things not possible in C++ . All you have to do is deﬁne operator    with the appropriate parameter types:  class X { public:  };     deﬁne ‘‘function call’’ operator: return-value operator    arguments  const; ...  11 Thanks to Alisdair Meredith for pointing this out. 12 Since C++11, the standard uses the term function object for every object that can be used as a function call. Thus, function pointers, objects of classes with operator    or with a conversion to a pointer to function, and lambdas are function objects. Here in this book, however, I use the term for objects of classes with operator    deﬁned.   234  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library  Now you can use objects of this class to behave like a function that you can call:     call operator    for function object fo  fo.operator   arg1,arg2 ;    call operator    for function object fo  The following is a complete example. This is the function object version of a previous example  see Section 6.8.1, page 224  that did the same with an ordinary function:  X fo; ... fo arg1,arg2 ;  The call is equivalent to:     stl foreach2.cpp  include   include   include   using namespace std;     simple function object that prints the passed argument class PrintInt {  void operator    int elem  const {  cout << elem << ’ ’;  public:  }  };  int main   {  vector  coll;     insert elements from 1 to 9 for  int i=1; i<=9; ++i  {  coll.push_back i ;  }     print all elements for_each  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  PrintInt   ;     range    operation  cout << endl;  }  The class PrintInt deﬁnes objects for which you can call operator    with an int argument. The expression  PrintInt   in the statement   6.10 Function Objects  235  for_each  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  PrintInt   ;  creates a temporary object of this class, which is passed to the for_each   algorithm as an argu- ment. The for_each   algorithm is written like this:  namespace std {  template   Operation for_each  Iterator act, Iterator end, Operation op  {  while  act != end  {  op *act ; ++act;  } return op;     as long as not reached the end    - call op   for actual element    - move iterator to the next element  }  }  for_each   uses the temporary function object op to call op *act  for each element act. If op is an ordinary function, for_each   simply calls it with *act as an argument. If op is a function object, for_each   calls its operator    with *act as an argument. Thus, in this example program, for_each   calls:  PrintInt::operator   *act   You may be wondering what all this is good for. You might even think that function objects look strange, nasty, or nonsensical. It is true that they do complicate code. However, function objects are more than functions, and they have some advantages: 1. Function objects are “functions with state.” Objects that behave like pointers are smart point- ers. This is similarly true for objects that behave like functions: They can be “smart functions” because they may have abilities beyond operator   . Function objects may have other member functions and attributes. This means that function objects have a state. In fact, the same function- ality, represented by two different function objects of the same type, may have different states at the same time. This is not possible for ordinary functions. Another advantage of function objects is that you can initialize them at runtime before you use call them.  2. Each function object has its own type. Ordinary functions have different types only when their signatures differ. However, function objects can have different types even when their sig- natures are the same. In fact, each functional behavior deﬁned by a function object has its own type. This is a signiﬁcant improvement for generic programming using templates because you can pass functional behavior as a template parameter. Doing so enables containers of different types to use the same kind of function object as a sorting criterion, ensuring that you don’t as- sign, combine, or compare collections that have different sorting criteria. You can even design hierarchies of function objects so that you can, for example, have different, special kinds of one general criterion.  3. Function objects are usually faster than ordinary functions. The concept of templates usu- ally allows better optimization because more details are deﬁned at compile time. Thus, passing function objects instead of ordinary functions often results in better performance.   236  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library  In the rest of this subsection, I present some examples that demonstrate how function objects can be “smarter” than ordinary functions. Chapter 10, which deals only with function objects, provides more examples and details. In particular, Chapter 10 shows how to beneﬁt from the ability to pass functional behavior as a template parameter.  Suppose that you want to add a certain value to all elements of a collection. If you know the  value you want to add at compile time, you could use an ordinary function:  for_each  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  add10 ;     range    operation  If you need different values that are known at compile time, you could use a template instead:  void add10  int& elem  {  elem += 10;  void f1   {  vector  coll; ...  template   void add  int& elem  {  elem += theValue;  void f1   {  vector  coll; ...  }  }  }  }  for_each  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  add  ;     range    operation  If you process the value to add at runtime, things get complicated. You must pass that value to the function before the function is called. This normally results in a global variable that is used both by the function that calls the algorithm and by the function that is called by the algorithm to add that value. This is messy style.  If you need such a function twice, with two different values to add, and if both values are pro- cessed at runtime, you can’t achieve this with one ordinary function. You must either pass a tag or write two different functions. Did you ever copy the deﬁnition of a function because it had a static   6.10 Function Objects  237  variable to keep its state and you needed the same function with another state at the same time? This is exactly the same type of problem.  With function objects, you can write a “smarter” function that behaves in the desired way. Be- cause it may have a state, the object can be initialized by the correct value. Here is a complete example:13     stl add1.cpp  include   include   include   include "print.hpp" using namespace std;     function object that adds the value with which it is initialized class AddValue {  private:  public:  int theValue;     the value to add     constructor initializes the value to add AddValue int v  : theValue v  { }     the ‘‘function call’’ for the element adds the value void operator    int& elem  const {  elem += theValue;  }  };  int main   {  list  coll;     insert elements from 1 to 9 for  int i=1; i<=9; ++i  {  coll.push_back i ;  }     add value 10 to each element  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll,"initialized:  " ;  13 The auxiliary function PRINT_ELEMENTS   was introduced in Section 6.6, page 216.   238  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library  for_each  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  AddValue 10  ;     range    operation  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll,"after adding 10:  " ;     add value of ﬁrst element to each element for_each  coll.begin  , coll.end  , AddValue *coll.begin    ;     range    operation  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll,"after adding first element: " ;  }  After the initialization, the collection contains the values 1 to 9: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  initialized:  The ﬁrst call of for_each   adds 10 to each value:  for_each  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  AddValue 10  ;     range    operation  Here, the expression AddValue 10  creates an object of type AddValue that is initialized with the value 10. The constructor of AddValue stores this value as the member theValue. Inside for_each  , “  ” is called for each element of coll. Again, this is a call of operator    for the passed temporary function object of type AddValue. The actual element is passed as an argument. The function object adds its value 10 to each element. The elements then have the following values:  after adding 10:  11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19  The second call of for_each   uses the same functionality to add the value of the ﬁrst element to each element. This call initializes a temporary function object of type AddValue with the ﬁrst element of the collection:  AddValue *coll.begin     The output is then as follows:  after adding first element: 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30  See Section 11.4, page 520, for a modiﬁed version of this example, in which the AddValue function object type is a template for the type of value to add.  With this technique, two different function objects can solve the problem of having a function with two states at the same time. For example, you could simply declare two function objects and use them independently: AddValue addx x ; AddValue addy y ;     function object that adds value x    function object that adds value y  for_each  coll.begin  ,coll.end  ,     add value x to each element  addx ;  ...   6.10 Function Objects  239  for_each  coll.begin  ,coll.end  ,     add value y to each element  ... for_each  coll.begin  ,coll.end  ,     add value x to each element  addy ;  addx ;  Similarly, you can provide additional member functions to query or to change the state of the function object during its lifetime. See Section 10.1.3, page 482, for a good example.  Note that for some algorithms, the C++ standard library does not specify how often function objects are called for each element, and it might happen that different copies of the function object are passed to the elements. This might have some nasty consequences if you use function objects as predicates. Section 10.1.4, page 483, covers this issue.  6.10.2 Predeﬁned Function Objects  The C++ standard library contains several predeﬁned function objects that cover fundamental oper- ations. By using them, you don’t have to write your own function objects in several cases. A typical example is a function object used as a sorting criterion. The default sorting criterion for operator < is the predeﬁned sorting criterion less . Thus, if you declare  set  coll;  it is expanded to  set > coll;     sort elements with <  From there, it is easy to sort elements in the opposite order:  set > coll;     sort elements with >  Another place to apply predeﬁned function objects are algorithms. Consider the following example:     stl fo1.cpp  include   include   include   include   include "print.hpp" using namespace std;  int main   {  deque  coll = { 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 };  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll,"initialized: " ;     negate all values in coll   240  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library  transform  coll.cbegin  ,coll.cend  ,  coll.begin  , negate    ;  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll,"negated:  " ;     square all values in coll transform  coll.cbegin  ,coll.cend  ,  coll.cbegin  , coll.begin  , multiplies    ;  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll,"squared:  " ;  }     source    destination    operation     ﬁrst source    second source    destination    operation  First, the header for the predeﬁned function objects is included:    include    Then, two predeﬁned function objects are used to negate and square the elements in coll. In  transform  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  coll.begin  , negate    ;     source    destination    operation  the expression  negate     creates a function object of the predeﬁned class template negate  that simply returns the negated element of type int for which it is called. The transform   algorithm uses that operation to transform all elements of the ﬁrst collection into the second collection. If source and destination are equal, as in this case, the returned negated elements overwrite themselves. Thus, the statement negates each element in the collection.  Similarly, the function object multiplies is used to square all elements in coll: transform  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  coll.cbegin  , coll.begin  , multiplies    ;     ﬁrst source    second source    destination    operation  Here, another form of the transform   algorithm combines elements of two collections by using the speciﬁed operation and writes the resulting elements into the third collection. Again, all col- lections are the same, so each element gets multiplied by itself, and the result overwrites the old value.  Thus, the program has the following output: initialized: 1 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 negated: squared:  -1 -2 -3 -5 -7 -11 -13 -17 -19 1 4 9 25 49 121 169 289 361   6.10 Function Objects  6.10.3 Binders  241  You can use special function adapters, or so-called binders, to combine predeﬁned function objects with other values or use special cases. Here is a complete example:     stl bind1.cpp  include   include   include   include   include   include   include "print.hpp" using namespace std; using namespace std::placeholders;  int main   {  set > coll1 = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 }; deque  coll2;     Note: due to the sorting criterion greater    elements have reverse order: PRINT_ELEMENTS coll1,"initialized: " ;     transform all elements into coll2 by multiplying them with 10 transform  coll1.cbegin  ,coll1.cend  ,  back_inserter coll2 , bind multiplies   ,_1,10  ;  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll2,"transformed: " ;     source    destination    operation     replace value equal to 70 with 42 replace_if  coll2.begin  ,coll2.end  ,  bind equal_to   ,_1,70 , 42 ;  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll2,"replaced:  " ;     range    replace criterion    new value     remove all elements with values between 50 and 80 coll2.erase remove_if coll2.begin  ,coll2.end  ,  bind logical_and   ,  bind greater_equal   ,_1,50 , bind less_equal   ,_1,80   ,  coll2.end   ;  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll2,"removed:  " ;  }   242  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library  Here, the statement  transform  coll1.cbegin  ,coll1.cend  ,  back_inserter coll2 , bind multiplies   ,_1,10  ;     source    destination    operation  transforms all elements of coll1 into coll2  inserting  while multiplying each element by 10. To deﬁne the corresponding operation, bind   is used, which allows you to compose high-level function objects out of low-level function objects and placeholders, which are numeric identiﬁers that start with an underscore. By specifying  bind multiplies   ,_1,10   you deﬁne a function object that multiplies a ﬁrst passed argument with 10.  You could also use such a function object to multiply any value by 10. For example, the following  statements write 990 to the standard output:  auto f = bind multiplies   ,_1,10 ; cout << f 99  << endl;  This function object is passed to transform  , which is expecting as its fourth argument an oper- ation that takes one argument; namely, the actual element. As a consequence, transform   calls “‘multiply by 10” for each actual element and inserts the result into coll2, which means that after- ward coll2 contains all values of coll1 multiplied by 10.  Similarly, in replace_if  coll2.begin  ,coll2.end  ,  bind equal_to   ,_1,70 , 42 ;     range    replace criterion    new value  the following expression is used as a criterion to specify the elements that are replaced by 42:  bind equal_to   ,_1,70   Here, bind   calls the binary predicate equal_to with the passed ﬁrst parameter as ﬁrst argument and 70 as second argument. Thus, the function object speciﬁed via bind   yields true if a passed argument  element of coll2  is equal to 70. As a result, the whole statement replaces each value equal to 70 by 42.  The last example uses a combination of binders, where bind logical_and   ,  bind greater_equal   ,_1,50 , bind less_equal   ,_1,80    speciﬁes for a parameter x the unary predicate “x>=50&&x<=80.” This example demonstrates that you can use nested bind   expressions to describe even more complicated predicates and function objects. In this case, remove_if   uses the function object to remove all values between 50 and 80 out of the collection. In fact, remove_if   changes only the order and returns the new end, whereas coll2.erase   deletes the “removed” elements out of coll2  see Section 6.7.1, page 218, for details .   6.10 Function Objects  243  The output of the whole program is as follows:  initialized: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 transformed: 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 replaced: 90 80 42 60 50 40 30 20 10 90 42 40 30 20 10 removed:  Note that the placeholders have their own namespace: std::placeholders. For this reason, a corresponding using directive is placed at the beginning to be able to write _1 or _2 for a ﬁrst or second parameter of binders. Without any using directive, the last combination of binders would have to be speciﬁed as follows:  std::bind std::logical_and   ,  std::bind std::greater_equal   ,std::placeholders::_1,50 , std::bind std::less_equal   ,std::placeholders::_1,80    This kind of programming results in functional composition. What is interesting is that all these function objects are usually declared inline. Thus, you use a function-like notation or abstraction, but you get good performance.  There are other ways to deﬁne function objects. For example, to call a member function for each  element of a collection, you can specify the following:  for_each  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  bind &Person::save,_1  ;     range    operation: Person::save elem   The function object bind binds a speciﬁed member function to call it for every element, which is passed here with placeholder _1. Thus, for each element of the collection coll, the member function save   of class Person is called. Of course, this works only if the elements have type Person or a type derived from Person.  Section 10.2, page 486, lists and discusses in more detail all predeﬁned function objects, function adapters, and aspects of functional composition. Also given there is an explanation of how you can write your own function objects.  Before TR1,  there were other binders and adapters for functional composition, such as bind1st  , bind2nd  , ptr_fun  , mem_fun  , and mem_fun_ref  , but they have been dep- recated with C++11. See Section 10.2.4, page 497, for details.  6.10.4 Function Objects and Binders versus Lambdas  However, there are also some drawbacks to lambdas:  Lambdas are a kind of implicitly deﬁned function object. Thus, as written in Section 6.9, page 230, lambdas usually provide the more intuitive approach to deﬁning functional behavior of STL algo- rithms. In addition, lambdas should be as fast as function objects.   You can’t have a hidden internal state of such a function object. Instead, all data that deﬁnes a   The advantage of specifying the functional behavior where it is needed partially goes away when it is needed at multiple places. You can deﬁne a lambda and assign it to an auto object then  see Section 6.9, page 232 , but whether this is more readable than directly deﬁning a function object is probably a matter of taste.  state is deﬁned by the caller and passed as a capture.   244  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library  6.11 Container Elements  Elements of containers must meet certain requirements because containers handle them in a special way. In this section, I describe these requirements and discuss the consequences of the fact that containers make copies of their elements internally.  6.11.1 Requirements for Container Elements  Containers, iterators, and algorithms of the STL are templates. Thus, they can process both prede- ﬁned or user-deﬁned types. However, because of the operations that are called, some requirements apply. The elements of STL containers must meet the following three fundamental requirements: 1. An element must be copyable or movable. Thus, an element type implicitly or explicitly has to  provide a copy or move constructor.  A generated copy should be equivalent to the source. This means that any test for equality  returns that both are equal and that both source and copy behave the same.  2. An element must be  move  assignable by the assignment operator. Containers and algorithms  use assignment operators to overwrite old elements with new elements.  3. An element must be destroyable by a destructor. Containers destroy their internal copies of elements when these elements are removed from the container. Thus, the destructor must not be private. Also, as usual in C++, a destructor must not throw; otherwise, all bets are off.  Elements might also have to meet the following requirements:  These three operations are generated implicitly for any class. Thus, a class meets the requirements automatically, provided that no special versions of these operations are deﬁned and no special mem- bers disable the sanity of those operations.   For some member functions of sequence containers, the default constructor must be available. For example, it is possible to create a nonempty container or increase the number of elements with no hint of the values those new elements should have. These elements are created without any arguments by calling the default constructor of their type.   For several operations, the test of equality with operator == must be deﬁned and is especially needed when elements are searched. For unordered containers, however, you can provide your own deﬁnition of equivalence if the elements do not support operator ==  see Section 7.9.7, page 379 .   For associative containers, the operations of the sorting criterion must be provided by the ele-   For unordered containers, a hash function and an equivalence criterion must be provided for the  ments. By default, this is the operator   function object.  elements. See Section 7.9.2, page 363, for details.   6.12 Errors and Exceptions inside the STL  245  6.11.2 Value Semantics or Reference Semantics  Usually, all containers create internal copies of their elements and return copies of those elements. This means that container elements are equal but not identical to the objects you put into the con- tainer. If you modify objects as elements of the container, you modify a copy, not the original object. Copying values means that the STL containers provide value semantics. The containers contain the values of the objects you insert rather than the objects themselves. In practice, however, you may also need reference semantics. This means that the containers contain references to the objects that are their elements.  The approach of the STL to support only value semantics has both strengths and weaknesses. Its  strengths are that   Copying elements is simple.   References are error prone. You must ensure that references don’t refer to objects that no longer  exist. You also have to manage circular references, which might occur.  Its weaknesses are as follows:   Copying elements might result in bad performance or may not even be possible.   Managing the same object in several containers at the same time is not possible. In practice, you need both approaches; you need copies that are independent of the original data  value semantics  and copies that still refer to the original data and get modiﬁed accordingly  ref- erence semantics . Unfortunately, there is no support for reference semantics in the C++ standard library. However, you can implement reference semantics in terms of value semantics.  The obvious approach to implementing reference semantics is to use pointers as elements.14 However, ordinary pointers have the usual problems. For example, objects to which they refer may no longer exist, and comparisons may not work as desired because pointers instead of the objects are compared. Thus, you should be very careful when you use ordinary pointers as container elements. A better approach is to use a kind of smart pointer: objects that have a pointer-like interface but that do some additional checking or processing internally. Since TR1, in fact, the C++ stan- dard library provides class shared_ptr for smart pointers that can share the same object  see Section 5.2.1, page 76 . In addition, you could use class std::reference_wrapper   see Sec- tion 5.4.3, page 132  to let STL containers hold references. Section 7.11, page 388, provides exam- ples for both approaches.  6.12 Errors and Exceptions inside the STL  Errors happen. They might be logical errors caused by the program  the programmer  or runtime errors caused by the context or the environment of a program  such as low memory . Both kinds of errors may be handled by exceptions. This section discusses how errors and exceptions are handled inside the STL.  14 C programmers might recognize the use of pointers to get reference semantics. In C, function arguments are able to get passed only by value, so you need pointers to enable a call-by-reference.   246  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library  6.12.1 Error Handling  The design goal of the STL was the best performance rather than the highest security. Error checking wastes time, so almost none is done. This is ﬁne if you can program without making any errors but can be a catastrophe if you can’t. Before the STL was adopted into the C++ standard library, discussions were held about whether to introduce more error checking. The majority decided not to, for two reasons: 1. Error checking reduces performance, and speed is still a general goal of programs. As mentioned,  2.  good performance was one of the design goals of the STL. If you prefer safety over speed, you can still get it, either by adding wrappers or by using special versions of the STL. But when error checking is built into all basic operations, you can’t program to avoid error checking to get better performance For example, when every subscript operation checks whether a range is valid, you can’t write your own subscripts without checking. However, it is possible the other way around.  As a consequence, error checking is possible but usually not required inside the STL.  The C++ standard library states that any STL use that violates preconditions results in undeﬁned behavior. Thus, if indexes, iterators, or ranges are not valid, the result is undeﬁned. If you do not use a safe version of the STL, undeﬁned memory access typically results, which causes some nasty side effects or even a crash. In this sense, the STL is as error prone as pointers are in C. Finding such errors could be very hard, especially without a safe version of the STL. In particular, the use of the STL requires that the following be met:   Iterators must be valid. For example, they must be initialized before they are used. Note that iterators may become invalid as a side effect of other operations. In particular, iterators become invalid – for vectors and deques, if elements are inserted or deleted or reallocation takes place, and – for unordered containers, if rehashing takes place  which also might be the result of an inser-   Iterators that refer to the past-the-end position have no element to which to refer. Thus, calling operator * or operator -> is not allowed. This is especially true for the return values of the end  , cend  , and rend   container member functions.  tion .    Ranges must be valid:  – Both iterators that specify a range must refer to the same container. – The second iterator must be reachable from the ﬁrst iterator.    If more than one source range is used, the second and later ranges usually must have at least as   Destination ranges must have enough elements that can be overwritten; otherwise, insert iterators  many elements as the ﬁrst one.  must be used.  The following example shows some possible errors:   6.12 Errors and Exceptions inside the STL  247     stl iterbug.cpp  include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {  vector  coll1; vector  coll2;     empty collection    empty collection     RUNTIME ERROR:    - beginning is behind the end of the range vector ::iterator pos = coll1.begin  ; reverse  ++pos, coll1.end   ;     insert elements from 1 to 9 into coll1 for  int i=1; i<=9; ++i  {  coll1.push_back  i ;  }     RUNTIME ERROR:    - overwriting nonexisting elements copy  coll1.cbegin  , coll1.cend  ,  coll2.begin   ;     source    destination     RUNTIME ERROR:    - collections mistaken    - cbegin   and cend   refer to different collections copy  coll1.cbegin  , coll2.cend  ,     source    destination  coll1.end   ;  }  Note that because these errors occur at runtime, not at compile time, they cause undeﬁned behavior. There are many ways to make mistakes when using the STL, and the STL is not required to protect you from yourself. Thus, it is a good idea to use a “safe” STL, at least during software development. A ﬁrst version of a safe STL was introduced by Cay Horstmann  see [SafeSTL] . Another example is the “STLport,” which is available for free for almost any platform at [STLport]. In addition, library vendors now provide ﬂags to enable a “safer” mode, which especially should be enabled during development.15  15 For example, gcc provides the -D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG option for that.   248  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library  6.12.2 Exception Handling  The STL almost never checks for logical errors. Therefore, almost no exceptions are generated by the STL itself owing to a logical problem. In fact, there are only two function calls for which the standard requires that it might cause an exception directly: the at   member function, which is the checked version of the subscript operator, and reserve   if the passed size of elements exceeds max_size  . Other than that, the standard requires that only the usual standard exceptions may occur, such as bad_alloc for lack of memory or exceptions of user-deﬁned operations.  When are exceptions generated, and what happens to STL components when they are? For a long time during the standardization process of C++98, there was no deﬁned behavior about this. In fact, every exception resulted in undeﬁned behavior. Even the destruction of an STL container resulted in undeﬁned behavior if an exception was thrown during one of its operations. Thus, the STL was useless when you needed guaranteed and deﬁned behavior, because it was not even possible to unwind the stack.  How to handle exceptions was one of the last topics addressed during the standardization process of C++98. Finding a good solution was not easy, and it took a long time for the following reasons: 1. It was very difﬁcult to determine the degree of safety the C++ standard library should provide. You might argue that it is always best to provide as much safety as possible. For example, you could say that the insertion of a new element at any position in a vector ought to either succeed or have no effect. Ordinarily, an exception might occur while copying later elements into the next position to make room for the new element, from which a full recovery is impossible. To achieve the stated goal, the insert operation would need to be implemented to copy every element of the vector into new storage, which would have a serious impact on performance. If good performance is a design goal, as is the case for the STL, you can’t provide perfect exception handling in all cases. You have to ﬁnd a compromise that meets both needs.  2. There is no doubt that it is better to have guaranteed, deﬁned behavior for exceptions without a signiﬁcant performance penalty instead of the risk that exceptions might crash your system. However, there was a concern that the presence of code to handle exceptions could adversely affect performance. This would contradict the design goal of achieving the best possible perfor- mance. During the standardization of C++98, compiler writers stated that, in principle, exception handling can be implemented without any signiﬁcant performance overhead. However, it turned out that exception speciﬁcations could cause performance penalties, so they were replaced by noexcept with C++11  see Section 3.1.7, page 24 .  As a result of these discussions, the C++ standard library since C++98 gives the following basic guarantee for exception safety:16 The C++ standard library will not leak resources or violate con- tainer invariants in the face of exceptions.  Unfortunately, this is not enough for many purposes. Often, you need a stronger guarantee that speciﬁes that an operation has no effect if an exception is thrown. Such operations can be considered to be atomic with respect to exceptions. Or, to use terms from database programming, you could say that these operations support commit-or-rollback behavior or are transaction safe.  16 Many thanks to Dave Abrahams and Greg Colvin for their work on exception safety in the C++ standard library and for the feedback they gave me about this topic.   6.12 Errors and Exceptions inside the STL  249  Regarding this stronger guarantee, the C++ standard library now guarantees the following:   In general, no erase  , clear  , pop_back  , pop_front  , or swap   function throws an exception. Also, no copy constructor or assignment operator of a returned iterator throws an exception.   For all node-based containers  lists, forward lists, sets, multisets, maps, and multimaps , in- cluding the unordered containers, any failure to construct a node simply leaves the container as it was. Furthermore, removing a node can’t fail, provided that destructors don’t throw. How- ever, for multiple-element insert operations of associative containers, the need to keep elements sorted makes full recovery from throws impractical. Thus, all single-element insert operations of associative and unordered containers support commit-or-rollback behavior, provided that the hash function for unordered containers does not throw. That is, the single-element insert opera- tions either succeed or have no effect. In addition, it is guaranteed that all erase operations for both single and multiple elements always succeed, provided that the container’s compare or hash function does not throw.  For lists, even multiple-element insert operations are transaction safe. In fact, all list opera- tions except remove  , remove_if  , merge  , sort  , and unique   either succeed or have no effect. For some of the exceptional operations, the C++ standard library provides conditional guarantees. Thus, if you need a transaction-safe container, you should use a list.  tion safe.17  For forward lists, insert_after  , emplace_after  , and push_front   are transac-   All array-based containers  arrays, vectors, and deques  do not fully recover when an element gets inserted. To do this, they would have to copy all subsequent elements before any insert operation, and handling full recovery for all copy operations would take quite a lot of time. However, push and pop operations that operate at the end do not require that existing elements get copied. If they throw, it is guaranteed that they have no effect. Furthermore, if elements have a type with copy operations  copy constructor and assignment operator  that do not throw, every container operation for these elements either succeeds or has no effect.  Note that all these guarantees are based on the requirement that destructors never throw, which should always be the case in C++. The C++ standard library makes this promise, and so must the application programmer.  If you need a container with full commit-or-rollback ability, you should use either a list  without calling or special handling for remove  , remove_if  , merge  , sort  , and unique    or an associative unordered container  without calling their multiple-element insert operations . This avoids having to make copies before a modifying operation to ensure that no data gets lost. Note that making copies of a container could be very expensive.  If you can’t use a node-based container and need the full commit-or-rollback ability, you have to provide wrappers for each critical operation. For example, the following function would almost safely insert a value in any container at a certain position:  17 The C++11 standard does not say this for emplace_after   and push_front  , which likely is a defect.   250  Chapter 6: The Standard Template Library  template   void insert  Cont& coll, const Iter& pos, const T& value  {     copy container and all elements  coll.insert pos,value ;     try to modify the copy  Cont tmp coll ; try {  } catch  ...  {  coll.swap tmp ; throw;  }  }     in case of an exception    - restore original container    - and rethrow the exception  Note that I wrote “almost,” because this function still is not perfect: the swap   operation throws when, for associative containers, copying the comparison criterion throws. You see, handling excep- tions perfectly is not easy.  6.13 Extending the STL  The STL is designed as a framework that may be extended in almost any direction.  6.13.1 Integrating Additional Types  You can supply your own containers, iterators, algorithms, or function objects, provided that they meet certain requirements. In fact, the C++ standard library lacks some useful extensions. This happened because at some point, the committee had to stop introducing new features and concentrate on perfecting the existing parts; otherwise, the job would never have been completed. That was the reason, for example, that hash tables were not part of C++98.  Useful extensions can be iterators  see Section 9.6, page 471, or Section 14.3, page 726 , con- tainers  see Section 7.10, page 385 , and algorithms  for example, see Section 7.6.2, page 308, or Section 9.5.1, page 468 . Note that all these extensions follow the principle of generic programming:   Anything that behaves like a container is a container.   Anything that behaves like an iterator is an iterator. Thus, whenever you have a container-like class, you can integrate it into the framework of the STL by providing the corresponding interface  begin  , end  , some type deﬁnitions, etc. . If you can’t add members to such a class, you can still provide a wrapper class that provides corresponding iterators.  Note, however, that some container-like objects do not ﬁt into the concept of the STL. For exam- ple, the fact that STL containers have a begin and an end makes it hard for circular container types, such as a ring buffer, to ﬁt in the STL framework.  Section 7.1.2, page 254, lists all common container operations and marks those that are required for STL containers. Note, however, that this doesn’t mean that you have to ﬁt in the STL framework   6.13 Extending the STL  251  only if you meet all these requirements. It might often be enough to fulﬁll requirements only partially so that some but not all behavior might work. Even some standard STL containers violate STL container requirements. For example, forward_lists do not provide size  , and arrays do not fulﬁll the general requirement that an STL container initialized with the default constructor is empty.  6.13.2 Deriving from STL Types  Another question is whether you can extend the behavior of STL types by deriving from them and adding behavior. However, usually that’s not possible. For performance reasons, all the STL classes have no virtual functions and are therefore not provided for polymorphism through public inheri- tance. To add new behavior for containers, you should deﬁne a new class that internally uses STL classes or derives privately from them.   This page intentionally left blank    Chapter 7 STL Containers  Continuing the discussion begun in Chapter 6, this chapter discusses STL containers in detail. The chapter starts with an overview of the general abilities and operations of all container classes, with each container class explained in detail. The explanation includes a description of their internal data structures, their operations, and their performance. It also shows how to use the various operations and gives examples if the usage is not trivial. Examples are given showing the typical use of each container. The chapter then discusses the interesting question of when to use which container. By comparing the general abilities, advantages, and disadvantages of all container types, the chapter shows you how to ﬁnd the best container to meet your needs.  The chapter is supplemented by Chapter 8, which explains all container members, types, and  operations in detail.  The C++ standard library provides some special container classes, the so-called container adap- ters  stack, queue, priority queue . In addition, a few classes provide a container-like interface  for example, strings, bitsets, and valarrays . All these classes are covered separately.1 Container adap- ters and bitsets are covered in Chapter 12. The STL interface of strings is covered in Section 13.2.14, page 684. Valarrays are described in Section 17.4, page 943.  1 Historically, container adapters are part of the STL. However, from a conceptual perspective, they are not part of the STL framework but rather “only” use the STL.   254  Chapter 7: STL Containers  7.1 Common Container Abilities and Operations  7.1.1 Container Abilities  This section covers the common abilities of STL container classes. Most of these abilities are re- quirements that, in general, every STL container should meet. The three core abilities are as follows:  1. All containers provide value rather than reference semantics. Containers copy and or move ele- ments internally when they are inserted rather than managing references to them. Thus, ideally, each element of an STL container must be able to be copied and moved. If objects you want to store don’t have a public copy constructor, or if copying is not useful — because, for example, it takes too much time or elements must be part of multiple containers — you might use only move operations, or the container elements must be pointers or pointer objects that refer to these objects. Section 7.11, page 388, provides an example for using shared pointers to get reference semantics.  2. The elements inside a container have a speciﬁc order. Each container type provides operations that return iterators to iterate over the elements. This is the key interface of the STL algorithms. Thus, if you iterate multiple times over the elements, you will ﬁnd the same order, provided that you don’t insert or delete elements. This applies even to “unordered containers,” as long as you don’t call operations that add or delete elements or force an internal reorganization. In general, operations are not “safe” in the sense that they check for every possible error. The caller must ensure that the parameters of the operations meet the requirements these operations have. Violating these requirements, such as using an invalid index, results in undeﬁned behavior, which means that anything can happen.  3.  Usually, the STL does not throw exceptions by itself. If user-deﬁned operations called by the  STL containers do throw, the behavior differs. See Section 6.12.2, page 248, for details.  7.1.2 Container Operations  The standard speciﬁes a list of common container requirements that shall apply to all STL contain- ers. However, due to the variety of containers provided with C++11, there might be exceptions so that some containers even don’t fulﬁll all general container requirements, and that there are addi- tional operations provided by all containers. Tables 7.1 and 7.2 list the operations that are common to  almost  all containers. Column “Req” signs operations that are part of the general container requirements. The following subsections explore some of these common operations.  Initialization  Every container class provides a default constructor, a copy constructor, and a destructor. You can also initialize a container with elements of a given range and, since C++11, with an initializer list.   7.1 Common Container Abilities and Operations  255  Operation ContType c  Req Effect Yes Default constructor; creates an empty container without any  ContType c c2   ContType c = c2  Yes  Yes  element  array  gets default elements  Copy constructor; creates a new container as a copy of c2  all elements are copied  Copy constructor; creates a new container as a copy of c2  all elements are copied   ContType c rv   Yes Move constructor; creates a new container, taking the  contents of the rvalue rv  since C++11; not for array    ContType c = rv  Yes Move constructor; creates a new container, taking the  ContType c beg,end   ContType c initlist   ContType c = initlist  c.~ContType   c.empty    c.size    c.max_size   c1 == c2 c1 != c2  c1 < c2  c1 > c2  c1 <= c2  c1 >= c2  c = c2 c = rv  c = initlist  c1.swap c2  swap c1,c2   –  –  –  contents of the rvalue rv  since C++11; not for array   Creates a container and initializes it with copies of all elements of [beg,end   not for array   Creates a container and initializes it with copies of the values of the initializer list initlist  since C++11; not for array   Creates a container and initializes it with copies of the values of the initializer list initlist  since C++11   Yes  Yes Yes Yes  Yes Deletes all elements and frees the memory, if possible Returns whether the container is empty  equivalent to Yes size  ==0 but might be faster  Returns the current number of elements  not for forward_list   Returns the maximum number of elements possible Returns whether c1 is equal to c2 Returns whether c1 is not equal to c2  equivalent to ! c1==c2   Returns whether c1 is less than c2  not for unordered containers  Returns whether c1 is greater than c2  equivalent to c2<c1; not for unordered containers  Returns whether c1 is less than or equal to c2  equivalent to ! c2<c1 ; not for unordered containers  Returns whether c1 is greater than or equal to c2  equivalent to ! c1<c2 ; not for unordered containers   –  –  –  –  Yes Assigns all elements of c2 to c Yes Move assigns all elements of the rvalue rv to c  since  C++11; not for array   Assigns all elements of the initializer list initlist  since C++11; not for array   Swaps the data of c1 and c2 Swaps the data of c1 and c2  –  Yes Yes  Table7.1.

CommonOperationsof AlmostAll ContainerClasses,Part2  The constructor for an initializer list  see Section 3.1.3, page 15  provides a convenient way to specify initial values. This is especially useful to initialize constant containers:     initialize a vector with some speciﬁc values  since C++11  const std::vector  v1 = { 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 21 };     same with different syntax const std::vector  v2 { 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 21 };     initialize an unordered set with ‘‘hello’’ and two empty strings std::unordered_set  w = { "hello", std::string  , "" };  Some special rules apply to the use of initializer lists for array  containers  see Section 7.2.1, page 262, for details .  The constructor for a given range provides the ability to initialize the container with elements of another container, with a C-style array, or from standard input. This constructor is a member template  see Section 3.2, page 34 , so not only the container but also the type of the elements may differ, provided that there is an automatic conversion from the source element type to the destination element type. For example:   You can initialize a container with the elements of another container:  std::list  l; ...    copy all elements of the list as floats into a vector std::vector  c l.begin  ,l.end   ;     l is a linked list of ints  Since C++11, you can also move the elements here, using a move iterator  see Section 9.4.4, page 466 :  std::list  l; ...    move all elements of the list into a vector std::vector  c std::make_move_iterator l.begin   ,     l is a linked list of strings  std::make_move_iterator l.end    ;   7.1 Common Container Abilities and Operations  257    You can initialize a container with the elements of an ordinary C-style array:  int carray[] = { 2, 3, 17, 33, 45, 77 }; ...    copy all elements of the C-style array into a set std::set  c std::begin carray ,std::end carray  ;  std::begin   and std::end   for C-style arrays are deﬁned since C++11 in  . Note that before C++11, you had to call:  std::set  c carray,carray+sizeof carray  sizeof carray[0]  ;    You can initialize a container from standard input:     read all integer elements of the deque from standard input std::deque  c{std::istream_iterator  std::cin ,  std::istream_iterator   };  Note that you should use the new uniform initialization syntax with brackets  see Section 3.1.3, page 15 . Otherwise, you need extra parentheses around the initializer arguments here:     read all integer elements of the deque from standard input std::deque  c  std::istream_iterator  std::cin  ,   std::istream_iterator     ;  The reason is that without the extra parentheses, you specify something very different, so you will probably get some strange warnings or errors in following statements. Consider writing the statement without extra parentheses:  std::deque  c std::istream_iterator  std::cin ,  std::istream_iterator    ;  In this case, c declares a function having deque  as return type. Its ﬁrst parameter is of type istream_iterator  with the name cin, and its second unnamed parameter is of type “function taking no arguments returning istream_iterator .” This construct is valid syntactically as either a declaration or an expression. So, according to language rules, it is treated as a declaration. The extra parentheses force the initializer not to match the syntax of a declaration.2  In principle, these techniques are also provided to assign or to insert elements from another range. However, for those operations, the exact interfaces either differ due to additional arguments or are not provided for all container classes.  Finally, since C++11, you can use a move constructor  see Section 3.1.5, page 21  to initialize a  container  for array , it is implicitly deﬁned :  std::vector  v1; ...    move contents of v1 into v2, state of v1 undeﬁned afterward std::vector  v2 = std::move v1 ;  As a result, the newly created container has the elements of the container used for initialization, whereas the contents of the container used for the initialization is unspeciﬁed afterward. This con- structor provides signiﬁcant performance improvements because internally, the elements are moved  2 Thanks to John H. Spicer from EDG for this explanation.   258  Chapter 7: STL Containers  by switching some pointers instead of copying element by element. So whenever you no longer need a container, which gets copied, you should use the move constructor.  Assignments and swap    If you assign containers, you copy all elements of the source container and remove all old elements in the destination container. Thus, assignment of containers is relatively expensive.  Since C++11, you can use the move assignment semantics instead  see Section 3.1.5, page 21 . All containers provide move assignment operators  array  implicitly again , declared for rvalues, which internally just swap pointers to the memory of values rather than copying all values. The exact behavior is not speciﬁed, but the guarantee of constant complexity for this operation leads to an implementation like this. The C++ standard library simply speciﬁes that after a move assignment, the container on the left-hand side of the assignment has the elements that the container on the right- hand side of the assignment had before. The contents of the container on the right-hand side are undeﬁned afterward:  std::vector  v1; std::vector  v2; ...    move contents of v1 into v2, state of v1 undeﬁned afterward v2 = std::move v1 ;  So, for performance reasons, you should use this way of assignment if after an assignment, the contents of the container on the right-hand side are no longer used.  In addition and since C++98, all containers provide a swap   member function to swap contents of two containers. In fact, it swaps only some internal pointers that refer to the data  elements, allocator, sorting criterion, if any . So, swap   is guaranteed to have only constant complexity, not the linear complexity of a copy assignment. Iterators and references to elements of a container follow swapped elements. So, after swap  , iterators and references still refer to the elements they referred to before, which, however, are in a different container then.  Note that for containers of type array , the behavior of swap   is slightly different. Because you can’t internally just swap pointers, swap   has linear complexity, and iterators and references refer to the same container but different elements afterward.  Size Operations  For  almost  all container classes, three size operations are provided: 1. empty   returns whether the number of elements is zero  begin  ==end   . You should prefer it over size  ==0, because it might be implemented more efﬁciently than size  , and size   is not provided for forward lists.  2. size   returns the current number of elements of the container. This operation is not provided for  forward_list  because it couldn’t have constant complexity there.  3. max_size   returns the maximum number of elements a container might contain. This value is implementation deﬁned. For example, a vector typically contains all elements in a single block   7.1 Common Container Abilities and Operations  259  of memory, so there might be relevant restrictions on PCs. Otherwise, max_size   is usually the maximum value of the type of the index.  Comparisons  For all but unordered containers, the usual comparison operators ==, !=,  , and >= are deﬁned according to the following three rules: 1. Both containers must have the same type. 2. Two containers are equal if their elements are equal and have the same order. To check equality  3. To check whether a container is less than another container, a lexicographical comparison is done  of elements, operator == is used.   see Section 11.5.4, page 548 .  For unordered containers, only the operators == and != are deﬁned. They return true when each element in one container has an equal element in the other container. The order doesn’t matter  that’s why they are unordered containers .  Because the operators  , and >= are not provided for unordered container, only the op- erators == and != are a common container requirement. Before C++11 all comparison operators were required. Since C++11 there is an table of “optional container requirements” that covers the remaining four comparison operators.  To compare containers with different types, you must use the comparing algorithms of Sec-  tion 11.5.4, page 542.  Element Access  All containers provide an iterator interface, which means that range-based for loops are supported  see Section 3.1.4, page 17 . Thus, the easiest way to get access to all elements since C++11 is as follows:  for  const auto& elem : coll  {  std::cout << elem << std::endl;  To be able to manipulate the elements, you should skip the const:  for  auto& elem : coll  {  elem = ...;  To operate with positions  for example, to be able to insert, delete, or move elements around , you can always use iterators yielded by cbegin   and cend   for read-only access:  for  auto pos=coll.cbegin  ; pos!=coll.cend  ; ++pos  {  std::cout << *pos << std::endl;  and iterators yielded by begin   and end   for write access:  for  auto pos=coll.begin  ; pos!=coll.end  ; ++pos  {  *pos = ...;  }  }  }  }   260  Chapter 7: STL Containers  Before C++11, you had to, and still can, declare the type of the iterator explicitly for read access:  colltype::const_iterator pos; for  pos=coll.begin  ; pos!=coll.end  ; ++pos  {  or for write access  ...;  ...;  }  }  colltype::iterator pos; for  pos=coll.begin  ; pos!=coll.end  ; ++pos  {  All containers except vectors and deques guarantee that iterators and references to elements remain valid if other elements are deleted. For vectors, only the elements before the point of erase remain valid.  If you remove all elements by using clear  , for vectors, deques, and strings any past-the-end  iterator returned by end   or cend   may become invalid.  If you insert elements, only lists, forward lists, and associative containers guarantee that iterators and references to elements remain valid. For vectors, this guarantee is given if insertions don’t exceed the capacity. For unordered containers, that guarantee is given to references in general but to iterators only when no rehashing happens, which is guaranteed as long as with insertions the number of resulting elements is less than the bucket count times the maximum load factor.  7.1.3 Container Types  All containers provide common type deﬁnitions, which are listed in Table 7.3.  Type Req Effect Yes size_type difference_type Yes Yes value_type Yes reference const_reference Yes Yes iterator Yes const_iterator – pointer – const_pointer  Unsigned integral type for size values Signed integral type for difference values Type of the elements Type of element references Type of constant element references Type of iterators Type of iterators to read-only elements Type of pointers to elements  since C++11  Type of pointers to read-only elements  since C++11   Table7.3. CommonTypesDeﬁnedbyAllContainerClasses   7.2 Arrays  7.2 Arrays  261  An array — an instance of the container class array  — models a static array. It wraps an ordinary static C-style array providing the interface of an STL container  Figure 7.1 . Conceptionally, an array is a sequence of elements with constant size. Thus, you can neither add nor remove elements to change the size. Only a replacement of element values is possible.  fixed number of elements   Figure7.1. StructureofanArray  Class array , introduced to the C++ standard library with TR1, results from a useful wrapper class for ordinary C-style arrays Bjarne Stroustrup introduced in his book [Stroustrup:C++]. It is safer and has no worse performance than an ordinary array.  To use an array, you must include the header ﬁle  : include    There, the type is deﬁned as a class template inside namespace std:  namespace std {  template   class array;  }  The elements of an array may have any type T.  lifetime. Thus, size   always yields N.  Allocator support is not provided.  7.2.1 Abilities of Arrays  The second template parameter speciﬁes the number of elements the array has throughout its  Arrays copy their elements into their internal static C-style array. The elements always have a certain order. Thus, arrays are a kind of ordered collection. Arrays provide random access. Thus, you can access every element directly in constant time, provided that you know its position. The iterators are random-access iterators, so you can use any algorithm of the STL.  If you need a sequence with a ﬁxed number of elements, class array  has the best performance because memory is allocated on the stack  if possible , reallocation never happens, and you have random access.   262  Initialization  Chapter 7: STL Containers  Regarding initialization, class array  has some unique semantics. As a ﬁrst example, the default constructor does not create an empty container, because the number of elements in the container is always constant according to the second template parameter throughout its lifetime.  Note that array  is the only container whose elements are default initialized when nothing is passed to initialize the elements. This means that for fundamental types, the initial value might be undeﬁned rather than zero  see Section 3.2.1, page 37 . For example:  std::array  x;     OOPS: elements of x have undeﬁned value  You can provide an empty initializer list instead. In that case, all values are guaranteed to be value initialized, which has the effect that elements of fundamental types are zero initialized:    OK: all elements of x have value 0  int     std::array  x = {};  The reason is that although array  seems to provide a constructor for initializer lists, it does not. Instead, array  fulﬁlls the requirements of an aggregate.3 Therefore, even before C++11, you could use an initializer list to initialize an array when it got created:  std::array  coll = { 42, 377, 611, 21, 44 };  The elements in the initializer list must have the same type, or there must be a type conversion to the element type of the array deﬁned.  If an initializer list does not have enough elements, the elements in the array are initialized via the default constructor of the element type. In this case, it is guaranteed that for fundamental data types the elements are zero initialized. For example:  std::array  c2 = { 42 };    one element with value 42     followed by 9 elements with value 0  If the number of elements in the initializer lists is higher than the size of the array, the expression is ill-formed:  std::array  c3 = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 };     ERROR: too many values  Because no constructors or assignment operators for initializer lists are provided, initializing an array during its declaration is the only way to use initializer lists. For this reason, you also can’t use the parenthesis syntax to specify initial values  which differs from other container types :  std::array  a { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 } ; std::vector  v { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 } ;     ERROR    OK  Class array  being an aggregate also means that the member that holds all the elements is public. However, its name is not speciﬁed in the standard; thus, any direct access to the public member that holds all elements results in undeﬁned behavior and is deﬁnitely not portable.  3 An aggregate is an array or a class with no user-provided constructors, no private or protected nonstatic data members, no base classes, and no virtual functions.   7.2 Arrays  swap   and Move Semantics  263  As for all other containers, array  provides swap   operations. Thus, you can swap elements with a container of the same type  same element type and same number of elements . Note, however, that an array  can’t simply swap pointers internally. For this reason, swap   has linear complexity and the effect that iterators and references don’t swap containers with their elements. So, iterators and references refer to the same container but different elements afterward.  You can use move semantics, which are implicitly provided for arrays. For example:4 std::array  ... as1 = std::move as2 ;  as1, as2;  Size  It is possible to specify a size of 0, which is an array with no elements. In that case, begin   and end  , cbegin   and cend  , and the corresponding reverse iterators still yield the same unique value. However, the return value of front   and back   is undeﬁned:  std::array  coll;     array with no elements  std::sort coll.begin  ,coll.end   ;  coll[5] = elem; std::cout << coll.front  ;     OK  but has no effect     RUNTIME ERROR ⇒ undeﬁned behavior    RUNTIME ERROR ⇒ undeﬁned behavior  For data  , the return value is unspeciﬁed, which means that you can pass the return value to other places as long as you don’t dereference it.  7.2.2 Array Operations  Create, Copy, and Destroy  Table 7.4 lists the constructors and destructors for arrays. Because class array  is an aggregate, these constructors are only implicitly deﬁned. You can create arrays with and without elements for initialization. The default constructor default initializes the elements, which means that the value of fundamental types is undeﬁned. If you use an initializer list but do not pass enough elements, the remaining elements are created with their default constructor  0 for fundamental types . See Section 7.1.2, page 254, for some remarks about possible initialization sources.  Again, note that unlike with other containers, you can’t use the parenthesis syntax with initializer  lists:  std::array  a { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 } ;     ERROR  4 Thanks to Daniel Krugler for providing this example.  ¨   264  Chapter 7: STL Containers  Operation array  c  array  c c2   array  c = c2  array  c rv   array  c = rv  Effect Default constructor; creates an array with default- initialized elements Copy constructor; creates a copy of another array of the same type  all elements are copied  Copy constructor; creates a copy of another array of the same type  all elements are copied  Move constructor; creates a new array taking the contents of the rvalue rv  since C++11  Move constructor; creates a new array, taking the contents of the rvalue rv  since C++11   array  c = initlist Creates an array initialized with the elements of the  initializer list  Table7.4.

NonmodifyingOperationsofClassarray   Assignments  Table 7.6 lists the ways to assign new values. Besides the assignment operator, you can use only fill   to assign a new value to each element, or swap   to swap values with another array. For operator = and swap  , both arrays have to have the same type, which means that both element type and size have to be the same.   7.2 Arrays  265  Operation c = c2 c = rv c.fill val  c1.swap c2  swap c1,c2   Effect Assigns all elements of c2 to c Move assigns all elements of the rvalue rv to c  since C++11  Assigns val to each element in array c Swaps the data of c1 and c2 Swaps the data of c1 and c2  Table7.6. AssignmentOperationsofClass array   Note that swap   can’t guarantee constant complexity for arrays, because it is not possible to exchange some pointers internally  see Section 7.2.1, page 263 . Instead, as with the algorithm swap_ranges    see Section 11.6.4, page 566 , for both arrays involved, all elements get new values assigned.  Internally, all these operations call the assignment operator of the element type.  Element Access  To access all elements of an array, you must use range-based for loops  see Section 3.1.4, page 17 , speciﬁc operations, or iterators. In addition, a tuple interface is provided, so you can also use get    to access a speciﬁc element  see Section 7.2.5, page 268, for details . Table 7.7 shows all array operations for direct element access. As usual in C and C++, the ﬁrst element has index 0, and the last element has index size  -1. Thus, the nth element has index n-1. For nonconstant arrays, these operations return a reference to the element. Thus, you could modify an element by using one of these operations, provided it is not forbidden for other reasons.  Operation c[idx] c.at idx   Effect Returns the element with index idx  no range checking  Returns the element with index idx  throws range-error exception if idx is out of range   c.front   Returns the ﬁrst element  no check whether a ﬁrst element exists  Returns the last element  no check whether a last element exists  c.back    Table7.7. DirectElementAccessofClass array   The most important issue for the caller is whether these operations perform range checking. Only at   performs range checking. If the index is out of range, at   throws an out_of_range exception  see Section 4.3, page 41 . All other functions do not check. A range error results in undeﬁned behavior. Calling operator [ ], front  , and back   for an empty array  always results in undeﬁned behavior. Note however that it is only empty if declared to have a size of 0:  std::array  coll;  coll[5] = elem; std::cout << coll.front  ;     only four elements!    RUNTIME ERROR ⇒ undeﬁned behavior    OK  coll has 4 element after construction    266  Chapter 7: STL Containers  std::array  coll2; std::cout << coll2.front  ;     always empty    RUNTIME ERROR ⇒ undeﬁned behavior  So, in doubt you must ensure that the index for operator [ ] is valid or use at  :  template   void foo  C& coll  {  if  coll.size   > 5  {  coll[5] = ...;     OK  coll.at 5  = ...;     throws out_of_range exception  Note that this code is OK only in single-threaded environments. In multithreaded contexts, you need synchronization mechanisms to prevent coll from being modiﬁed between the check for its size and the access to the element  see Section 18.4.3, page 984, for details .  }  }  Iterator Functions  Arrays provide the usual operations to get iterators  Table 7.8 . Array iterators are random-access iterators  see Section 9.2, page 433, for a discussion of iterator categories . Thus, in principle, you could use all algorithms of the STL.  Operation c.begin   c.end   c.cbegin   c.cend    c.rbegin   c.rend    Effect Returns a random-access iterator for the ﬁrst element Returns a random-access iterator for the position after the last element Returns a constant random-access iterator for the ﬁrst element  since C++11  Returns a constant random-access iterator for the position after the last element  since C++11  Returns a reverse iterator for the ﬁrst element of a reverse iteration Returns a reverse iterator for the position after the last element of a reverse iteration  c.crbegin   Returns a constant reverse iterator for the ﬁrst element of a reverse iteration  c.crend     since C++11  Returns a constant reverse iterator for the position after the last element of a reverse iteration  since C++11   Table7.8. IteratorOperationsofClass array   The exact type of these iterators is implementation deﬁned. For arrays, however, the iterators returned by begin  , cbegin  , end  , and cend   are often ordinary pointers, which is ﬁne be- cause an array  internally uses a C-style array for the elements and ordinary pointers provide the interface of random-access iterators. However, you can’t count on the fact that the iterators are ordi- nary pointers. For example, if a safe version of the STL that checks range errors and other potential   7.2 Arrays  267  problems is used, the iterator type is usually an auxiliary class. See Section 9.2.6, page 440, for a nasty difference between iterators implemented as pointers and iterators implemented as classes.  Iterators remain valid as long as the array remains valid. However, unlike for all other containers,  swap   assigns new values to the elements that iterators, references, and pointers refer to.  7.2.3 Using arrays as C-Style Arrays  As for class vector , the C++ standard library guarantees that the elements of an array  are in contiguous memory. Thus, you can expect that for any valid index i in array a, the following yields true:  &a[i] == &a[0] + i  This guarantee has some important consequences. It simply means that you can use an array  wherever you can use an ordinary C-style array. For example, you can use an array to hold data of ordinary C-strings of type char* or const char*:  std::array  a;     create static array of 41 chars  strcpy &a[0],"hello, world" ; printf "%s\n", &a[0] ;     copy a C-string into the array    print contents of the array as C-string  Note, however, that you don’t have to use the expression &a[0] to get direct access to the elements in the array, because the member function data   is provided for this purpose:  std::array  a;     create static array of 41 chars  strcpy a.data  ,"hello, world" ; printf "%s\n", a.data   ;     copy a C-string into the array    print contents of the array as C-string  Of course, you have to be careful when you use an array  in this way  just as you always have to be careful when using ordinary C-style arrays and pointers . For example, you have to ensure that the size of the array is big enough to copy some data into it and that you have an ’\0’ element at the end if you use the contents as a C-string. However, this example shows that whenever you need an array of type T for any reason, such as for an existing C library, you can use an array   or vector   and use data   where the ordinary C-style interface is required.  Note that you must not pass an iterator as the address of the ﬁrst element. Iterators of class array  have an implementation-speciﬁc type, which may be totally different from an ordinary pointer:  printf "%s\n", a.begin   ; printf "%s\n", a.data   ;     ERROR  might work, but not portable     OK   268  Chapter 7: STL Containers  7.2.4 Exception Handling  Arrays provide only minimal support for logical error checking. The only member function for which the standard requires that it may throw an exception is at  , which is the safe version of the subscript operator  see Section 7.2.2, page 265 .  For functions called by an array  functions for the element type or functions that are user- supplied  no special guarantees are generally given  because you can’t insert or delete elements, exceptions might occur only if you copy, move, or assign values . Note especially that swap   might throw because it performs an element-wise swap, which might throw.  See Section 6.12.2, page 248, for a general discussion of exception handling in the STL.  7.2.5 Tuple Interface  Arrays provide the tuple interface  see Section 5.1.2, page 68 . Thus, you can use the expressions tuple_size ::value to yield the number of elements, tuple_element ::type to yield the type of a speciﬁc element, and get   to gain access to a speciﬁc element. For example:  typedef std::array  FiveStrings;  FiveStrings a = { "hello", "nico", "how", "are", "you" };  std::tuple_size ::value std::tuple_element ::type std::get  a      yields 5    yields std::string    yields std::string "nico"   7.2.6 Examples of Using Arrays  The following example shows a simple use of class array :     cont array1.cpp  include   include   include   include   include "print.hpp" using namespace std;  int main   {     create array with 10 ints array  a = { 11, 22, 33, 44 };  PRINT_ELEMENTS a ;   7.2 Arrays  269     modify last two elements a.back   = 9999999; a[a.size  -2] = 42; PRINT_ELEMENTS a ;     process sum of all elements cout << "sum: "  << accumulate a.begin  ,a.end  ,0  << endl;     negate all elements transform a.begin  ,a.end  ,  a.begin  , negate    ;     source    destination    operation  PRINT_ELEMENTS a ;  }  As you can see, you can use the general container interface operations  operator =, size  , and operator [ ]  to manipulate the container directly. Because member functions such as begin   and end   for iterator access are also provided, you can also use different operations that call begin   and end  , such as modifying and nonmodifying algorithms and the auxiliary function PRINT_ELEMENTS  , which is introduced in Section 6.6, page 216.  The output of the program is as follows: 11 22 33 44 0 0 0 0 0 0 11 22 33 44 0 0 0 0 42 9999999 sum: 10000151 -11 -22 -33 -44 0 0 0 0 -42 -9999999   270  7.3 Vectors  Chapter 7: STL Containers  A vector models a dynamic array. Thus, a vector is an abstraction that manages its elements with a dynamic C-style array  Figure 7.2 . However, the standard does not specify that the implementation uses a dynamic array. Rather, this follows from the constraints and speciﬁcation of the complexity of its operation.  Figure7.2. StructureofaVector  To use a vector, you must include the header ﬁle  :  include    There, the type is deﬁned as a class template inside namespace std:  namespace std {  template <typename T,  class vector;  }  typename Allocator = allocator  >  The elements of a vector may have any type T. The optional second template parameter deﬁnes the memory model  see Chapter 19 . The default memory model is the model allocator, which is provided by the C++ standard library.  7.3.1 Abilities of Vectors  A vector copies its elements into its internal dynamic array. The elements always have a certain order. Thus, a vector is a kind of ordered collection. A vector provides random access. Thus, you can access every element directly in constant time, provided that you know its position. The iterators are random-access iterators, so you can use any algorithm of the STL.  Vectors provide good performance if you append or delete elements at the end. If you insert or delete in the middle or at the beginning, performance gets worse. This is because every element behind has to be moved to another position. In fact, the assignment operator would be called for every following element.  Size and Capacity  Part of the way in which vectors give good performance is by allocating more memory than they need to contain all their elements. To use vectors effectively and correctly, you should understand how size and capacity cooperate in a vector.   7.3 Vectors  271  Vectors provide the usual size operations size  , empty  , and max_size    see Section 7.1.2, page 254 . An additional “size” operation is the capacity   function, which returns the number of elements a vector could contain in its actual memory. If you exceed the capacity  , the vector has to reallocate its internal memory.  The capacity of a vector is important for two reasons:  1. Reallocation invalidates all references, pointers, and iterators for elements of the vector. 2. Reallocation takes time. Thus, if a program manages pointers, references, or iterators into a vector, or if speed is a goal, it is important to take the capacity into account.  To avoid reallocation, you can use reserve   to ensure a certain capacity before you really need  it. In this way, you can ensure that references remain valid as long as the capacity is not exceeded:  std::vector  v; v.reserve 80 ;     create an empty vector    reserve memory for 80 elements  Another way to avoid reallocation is to initialize a vector with enough elements by passing additional arguments to the constructor. For example, if you pass a numeric value as parameter, it is taken as the starting size of the vector: std::vector  v 5 ;     creates a vector and initializes it with ﬁve values     calls ﬁve times the default constructor of type T   Of course, the type of the elements must provide a default constructor for this ability. For fundamen- tal types, zero initialization  see Section 3.2.1, page 37  is guaranteed. But note that for complex types, even if a default constructor is provided, the initialization takes time. If the only reason for initialization is to reserve memory, you should use reserve  .  The concept of capacity for vectors is similar to that for strings  see Section 13.2.5, page 669 , with one big difference: Unlike for strings, it is not possible to call reserve   for vectors to shrink the capacity. Calling reserve   with an argument that is less than the current capacity is a no-op. Furthermore, how to reach an optimal performance regarding speed and memory use is implementa- tion deﬁned. Thus, implementations might increase capacity in larger steps. In fact, to avoid internal fragmentation, many implementations allocate a whole block of memory  such as 2K  the ﬁrst time you insert anything if you don’t call reserve   ﬁrst yourself. This can waste a lot of memory if you have many vectors with only a few small elements.  Because the capacity of vectors never shrinks, it is guaranteed that references, pointers, and iterators remain valid even when elements are deleted, provided that they refer to a position before the manipulated elements. However, insertions invalidate all references, pointers, and iterators when the capacity gets exceeded.  C++11 introduced a new member function for vectors: a nonbinding request to shrink the capac-  ity to ﬁt the current number of elements:  v.shrink_to_fit  ;     request to shrink memory  since C++11   This request is nonbinding to allow latitude for implementation-speciﬁc optimizations. Thus, you cannot expect that afterward v.capacity==v.size   yields true.  Before C++11, there you could shrink the capacity only indirectly: Swapping the contents with another vector swaps the capacity. The following function shrinks the capacity while preserving the elements:   Chapter 7: STL Containers  272  }  template   void shrinkCapacity std::vector & v  {  std::vector  tmp v ; v.swap tmp ;     copy elements into a new vector    swap internal vector data  You could even shrink the capacity without calling this function by calling the following statement:5     shrink capacity of vector v for type T std::vector  v .swap v ;  However, note that after swap  , all references, pointers, and iterators swap their containers. They still refer to the elements to which they referred on entry. Thus, shrinkCapacity   invalidates all references, pointers, and iterators. The same is true for shrink_to_fit  .  vector  c c2   vector  c = c2  Operation vector  c  Effect Default constructor; creates an empty vector without any elements Copy constructor; creates a new vector as a copy of c2  all elements are copied  Copy constructor; creates a new vector as a copy of c2  all elements are copied  Move constructor; creates a new vector, taking the contents of the rvalue rv  since C++11  Move constructor; creates a new vector, taking the contents of the rvalue rv  since C++11  Creates a vector with n elements created by the default constructor Creates a vector initialized with n copies of element elem vector  c n,elem  vector  c beg,end  Creates a vector initialized with the elements of the range  vector  c = rv  vector  c rv   vector  c n   vector  c initlist   vector  c = initlist  c.~vector    [beg,end  Creates a vector initialized with the elements of initializer list initlist  since C++11  Creates a vector initialized with the elements of initializer list initlist  since C++11  Destroys all elements and frees the memory  Table7.9.

However, standard C++ allows you to call a nonconstant member function for temporary values.   7.3 Vectors  273  7.3.2 Vector Operations  Create, Copy, and Destroy  Table 7.9 lists the constructors and destructors for vectors. You can create vectors with and without elements for initialization. If you pass only the size, the elements are created with their default constructor. Note that an explicit call of the default constructor also initializes fundamental types, such as int, with zero  see Section 3.2.1, page 37 . See Section 7.1.2, page 254, for some remarks about possible initialization sources.

You can use different sources for assignments  6 reserve   and shrink_to_fit   manipulate the vector because they invalidate references, pointers, and iterators to elements. However, they are mentioned here because they do not manipulate the logical contents of the container.   274  Chapter 7: STL Containers  Operation c = c2 c = rv c = initlist  Effect Assigns all elements of c2 to c Move assigns all elements of the rvalue rv to c  since C++11  Assigns all elements of the initializer list initlist to c  since C++11  Assigns n copies of element elem  c.assign n,elem  c.assign beg,end  Assigns the elements of the range [beg,end  c.assign initlist  c1.swap c2  swap c1,c2   Assigns all the elements of the initializer list initlist Swaps the data of c1 and c2 Swaps the data of c1 and c2  Table7.11. AssignmentOperationsofVectors   containers, arrays, standard input  similar to those described for constructors  see Section 7.1.2, page 254 . All assignment operations call the default constructor, copy constructor, assignment operator, and or destructor of the element type, depending on how the number of elements changes. For example:  std::list  l; std::vector  coll; ...    make coll be a copy of the contents of l coll.assign l.begin  ,l.end   ;  Element Access  To access all elements of a vector, you must use range-based for loops  see Section 3.1.4, page 17 , speciﬁc operations, or iterators. Table 7.12 shows all vector operations for direct element access. As usual in C and C++, the ﬁrst element has index 0, and the last element has index size  -1. Thus, the nth element has index n-1. For nonconstant vectors, these operations return a reference to the element. Thus, you could modify an element by using one of these operations, provided it is not forbidden for other reasons.  Operation c[idx] c.at idx   Effect Returns the element with index idx  no range checking  Returns the element with index idx  throws range-error exception if idx is out of range   c.front   Returns the ﬁrst element  no check whether a ﬁrst element exists  Returns the last element  no check whether a last element exists  c.back    Table7.12. DirectElementAccessofVectors  The most important issue for the caller is whether these operations perform range checking. Only at   performs range checking. If the index is out of range, at   throws an out_of_range   7.3 Vectors  275  exception  see Section 4.3, page 41 . All other functions do not check. A range error results in undeﬁned behavior. Calling operator [ ], front  , and back   for an empty container always results in undeﬁned behavior:  std::vector  coll;  coll[5] = elem; std::cout << coll.front  ;     empty!    RUNTIME ERROR ⇒ undeﬁned behavior    RUNTIME ERROR ⇒ undeﬁned behavior  So, you must ensure that the index for operator [ ] is valid and that the container is not empty when either front   or back   is called:  std::vector  coll;     empty!  if  coll.size   > 5  {  coll[5] = elem;  } if  !coll.empty    {  } coll.at 5  = elem;  cout << coll.front  ;     OK     OK  Note that this code is OK only in single-threaded environments. In multithreaded contexts, you need synchronization mechanisms to ensure that coll is not modiﬁed between the check for its size and the access to the element  see Section 18.4.3, page 984, for details .     throws out_of_range exception  Iterator Functions  Vectors provide the usual operations to get iterators  Table 7.13 . Vector iterators are random-access iterators  see Section 9.2, page 433, for a discussion of iterator categories . Thus, in principle you could use all algorithms of the STL.  The exact type of these iterators is implementation deﬁned. For vectors, however, the iterators returned by begin  , cbegin  , end  , and cend   are often ordinary pointers, which is ﬁne because vectors usually use a C-style array for the elements and ordinary pointers provide the inter- face of random-access iterators. However, you can’t count on the fact that the iterators are ordinary pointers. For example, if a safe version of the STL that checks range errors and other potential prob- lems is used, the iterator type is usually an auxiliary class. See Section 9.2.6, page 440, for a nasty difference between iterators implemented as pointers and iterators implemented as classes.  Iterators remain valid until an element with a smaller index gets inserted or removed or until  reallocation occurs and capacity changes  see Section 7.3.1, page 270 .  Inserting and Removing Elements  Table 7.14 shows the operations provided for vectors to insert or to remove elements. As usual when using the STL, you must ensure that the arguments are valid. Iterators must refer to valid positions, and the beginning of a range must have a position that is not behind the end.   276  Operation c.begin   c.end   c.cbegin   c.cend    c.rbegin   c.rend    Chapter 7: STL Containers  Effect Returns a random-access iterator for the ﬁrst element Returns a random-access iterator for the position after the last element Returns a constant random-access iterator for the ﬁrst element  since C++11  Returns a constant random-access iterator for the position after the last element  since C++11  Returns a reverse iterator for the ﬁrst element of a reverse iteration Returns a reverse iterator for the position after the last element of a reverse iteration  c.crbegin   Returns a constant reverse iterator for the ﬁrst element of a reverse iteration  c.crend     since C++11  Returns a constant reverse iterator for the position after the last element of a reverse iteration  since C++11   Table7.13. IteratorOperationsofVectors  As usual, it is up to the programmer to ensure that the container is not empty when pop_back   is called. For example:  std::vector  coll;  coll.pop_back  ;  if  !coll.empty    { coll.pop_back  ;  }     OK     empty!    RUNTIME ERROR ⇒ undeﬁned behavior  Regarding performance, you should consider that inserting and removing happens faster when  However, note that in a multithreaded context you have to ensure that coll doesn’t get modiﬁed between the check for being empty and pop_back    see Section 18.4.3, page 984 .   Elements are inserted or removed at the end.   The capacity is large enough on entry.   Multiple elements are inserted by a single call rather than by multiple calls. Inserting or removing elements invalidates references, pointers, and iterators that refer to the follow- ing elements. An insertion that causes reallocation invalidates all references, iterators, and pointers. Vectors provide no operation to remove elements directly that have a certain value. You must use an algorithm to do this. For example, the following statement removes all elements that have the value val:  std::vector  coll; ...    remove all elements with value val coll.erase remove coll.begin  ,coll.end  ,  val , coll.end   ;  This statement is explained in Section 6.7.1, page 218.   7.3 Vectors  277  Operation c.push_back elem  c.pop_back   c.insert pos,elem   c.insert pos,n,elem   c.insert pos,beg,end   c.insert pos,initlist   c.emplace pos,args...   c.erase pos   c.erase beg,end   c.resize num   c.resize num,elem   c.clear    Effect Appends a copy of elem at the end Removes the last element  does not return it  Inserts a copy of elem before iterator position pos and returns the position of the new element Inserts n copies of elem before iterator position pos and returns the position of the ﬁrst new element  or pos if there is no new element  Inserts a copy of all elements of the range [beg,end  before iterator position pos and returns the position of the ﬁrst new element  or pos if there is no new element  Inserts a copy of all elements of the initializer list initlist before iterator position pos and returns the position of the ﬁrst new element  or pos if there is no new element; since C++11  Inserts a copy of an element initialized with args before iterator position pos and returns the position of the new element  since C++11    returns nothing; since C++11  Removes the element at iterator position pos and returns the position of the next element Removes all elements of the range [beg,end  and returns the position of the next element Changes the number of elements to num  if size   grows new elements are created by their default constructor  Changes the number of elements to num  if size   grows new elements are copies of elem  Removes all elements  empties the container   c.emplace_back args...  Appends a copy of an element initialized with args at the end  Table7.14. InsertandRemoveOperationsofVectors  To remove only the ﬁrst element that has a certain value, you must use the following statements:  std::vector  coll; ...    remove ﬁrst element with value val std::vector ::iterator pos; pos = find coll.begin  ,coll.end  ,  val ;  if  pos != coll.end    {  coll.erase pos ;  }   278  Chapter 7: STL Containers  7.3.3 Using Vectors as C-Style Arrays  As for class array , the C++ standard library guarantees that the elements of a vector are in contiguous memory. Thus, you can expect that for any valid index i in vector v, the following yields true:  &v[i] == &v[0] + i  This guarantee has some important consequences. It simply means that you can use a vector in all cases in which you could use a dynamic array. For example, you can use a vector to hold data of ordinary C-strings of type char* or const char*:  std::vector  v;     create vector as dynamic array of chars  v.resize 41 ; strcpy &v[0],"hello, world" ;    copy a C-string into the vector printf "%s\n", &v[0] ;     print contents of the vector as C-string     make room for 41 characters  including ’\0’   Note, however, that since C++11, you don’t have to use the expression &a[0] to get direct access to the elements in the vector, because the member function data   is provided for this purpose:  std::vector  v;     create static array of 41 chars  strcpy v.data  ,"hello, world" ;    copy a C-string into the array printf "%s\n", v.data   ;     print contents of the array as C-string  Of course, you have to be careful when you use a vector in this way  just as you always have to be careful when using ordinary C-style arrays and pointers . For example, you have to ensure that the size of the vector is big enough to copy some data into it and that you have an ’\0’ element at the end if you use the contents as a C-string. However, this example shows that whenever you need an array of type T for any reason, such as for an existing C library, you can use a vector  and pass the address of the ﬁrst element.  Note that you must not pass an iterator as the address of the ﬁrst element. Iterators of vectors  have an implementation-speciﬁc type, which may be totally different from an ordinary pointer:  printf "%s\n", v.begin   ; printf "%s\n", v.data   ; printf "%s\n", &v[0] ;     ERROR  might work, but not portable     OK  since C++11     OK, but data   is better  7.3.4 Exception Handling  Vectors provide only minimal support for logical error checking. The only member function for which the standard requires that it may throw an exception is at  , which is the safe version of the subscript operator  see Section 7.3.2, page 274 . In addition, the standard requires that only the usual standard exceptions may occur, such as bad_alloc for a lack of memory or exceptions of user-deﬁned operations.  If functions called by a vector  functions for the element type or functions that are user-supplied   throw exceptions, the C++ standard library provides the following guarantees:   7.3 Vectors  279  1.  If an element gets inserted with push_back   and an exception occurs, this function has no effect.  2. insert  , emplace  , emplace_back  , and push_back   either succeed or have no effect, provided that the copy move operations  constructors and assignment operators  of the elements do not throw.  3. pop_back   does not throw any exceptions. 4. erase   does not throw if the copy move operations  constructors and assignment operators  of  the elements do not throw.  5. swap   and clear   do not throw. 6.  If elements are used that never throw exceptions on copy move operations  constructors and assignment operators , every operation is either successful or has no effect. Such elements might be “plain old data”  POD . POD describes types that use no special C++ feature. For example, every ordinary C structure is POD.  All these guarantees are based on the requirements that destructors don’t throw. See Section 6.12.2, page 248, for a general discussion of exception handling in the STL.  7.3.5 Examples of Using Vectors  The following example shows a simple use of vectors:     cont vector1.cpp  include   include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {     create empty vector for strings vector  sentence;     reserve memory for ﬁve elements to avoid reallocation sentence.reserve 5 ;     append some elements sentence.push_back "Hello," ; sentence.insert sentence.end  ,{"how","are","you","?"} ;     print elements separated with spaces copy  sentence.cbegin  , sentence.cend  ,  ostream_iterator  cout," "  ;   280  Chapter 7: STL Containers  cout << endl;     print ‘‘technical data’’ cout << " cout << " cout << "  max_size  : " << sentence.max_size   << endl; size  : << endl; capacity  : " << sentence.capacity   << endl;  " << sentence.size       swap second and fourth element swap  sentence[1], sentence[3] ;     insert element "always" before element "?" sentence.insert  find sentence.begin  ,sentence.end  ,"?" ,  "always" ;     assign "!" to the last element sentence.back   = "!";     print elements separated with spaces copy  sentence.cbegin  , sentence.cend  ,  ostream_iterator  cout," "  ;  cout << endl;     print some ‘‘technical data’’ again cout << " cout << "  << endl; size  : capacity  : " << sentence.capacity   << endl;  " << sentence.size       delete last two elements sentence.pop_back  ; sentence.pop_back  ;    shrink capacity  since C++11  sentence.shrink_to_fit  ;     print some ‘‘technical data’’ again cout << " cout << "  size  : << endl; capacity  : " << sentence.capacity   << endl;  " << sentence.size    }  The output of the program might look like this:  Hello, how are you ?  max_size  : 1073741823 size  : 5 capacity  : 5   7.3 Vectors  281  Hello, you are how always !  6  size  : capacity  : 10 4 size  : capacity  : 4  Note my use of the word might. The values of max_size   and capacity   are unspeciﬁed and might vary from platform to platform. Here, for example, you can see that the implementation seems to double the capacity if the capacity no longer ﬁts and not necessarily shrinks if there is a request to do so.  7.3.6 Class vector   For Boolean elements, the C++ standard library provides a specialization of vector . The goal is to have a version that is optimized to use less size than a usual implementation of vector  for type bool. Such a usual implementation would reserve at least 1 byte for each element. The vector  specialization usually uses internally only 1 bit for an element, so it is typically eight times smaller. But such an optimization also has a snag: In C++, the smallest addressable value must have a size of at least 1 byte. Thus, such a specialization of a vector needs special handling for references and iterators.  As a result, a vector  does not meet all requirements of other vectors. For example, a vector ::reference is not a true lvalue and vector ::iterator is not a random- access iterator. Therefore, template code might work for vectors of any type except bool. In ad- dition, vector  might perform worse than normal implementations, because element opera- tions have to be transformed into bit operations. However, how vector  is implemented is implementation speciﬁc. Thus, the performance  speed and memory  might differ.  Note that class vector  is more than a specialization of vector  for bool. provides some special bit operations. You can handle bits or ﬂags in a more convenient way.  It also  vector  has a dynamic size, so you can consider it a bitﬁeld with dynamic size. Thus, you can add and remove bits. If you need a bitﬁeld with static size, you should use bitset rather than a vector . Class bitset is covered in Section 12.5, page 650.  The additional operations of vector  are shown in Table 7.15.  Operation c.flip   c[idx].flip    c[idx] = val  Effect Negates all Boolean elements  complement of all bits  Negates the Boolean element with index idx  complement of a single bit  Assigns val to the Boolean element with index idx  assignment to a single bit   c[idx1] = c[idx2] Assigns the value of the element with index idx2 to the element  with index idx1  Table7.15. SpecialOperationsofvector    282  Chapter 7: STL Containers  The operation flip  , which processes the complement, can be called for all bits and a single bit of the vector. The latter is remarkable because you might expect the operator [ ] to return a bool and that calling flip   for such a fundamental type is not possible. Here, the class vector  uses a common trick, called a proxy:7 For vector , the return type of the subscript operator  and other operators that return an element  is an auxiliary class. If you need the return value to be bool, an automatic type conversion is used. For other operations, the member functions are provided. The relevant part of the declaration of vector  looks like this:  template   class vector  {     auxiliary proxy type for element modiﬁcations: class reference {  namespace std {  public:  ... public:  reference& operator=  const bool  noexcept; reference& operator=  const reference&  noexcept; operator bool   const noexcept; void flip   noexcept;     automatic type conversion to bool    bit complement     assignments  }; ...  };  }     operations for element access return reference proxy instead of bool: reference operator[] size_type idx ; reference at size_type idx ; reference front  ; reference back  ; ...  As you can see, all member functions for element access return type reference. Thus, you could program something like the following statements:  c.front  .flip  ; c[5] = c.back  ;     negate ﬁrst Boolean element    assign last element to element with index 5  As usual, to avoid undeﬁned behavior, the caller must ensure that the ﬁrst, sixth, and last elements exist here.  Note that the internal proxy type reference is used only for nonconstant containers of type The constant member functions for element access return values of type  vector . const_reference, which is a type deﬁnition for bool.  7 A proxy allows you to keep control where usually no control is provided. This is often used to get more security. In this case, the proxy maintains control to allow certain operations, although, in principle, the return value behaves as bool.   7.4 Deques  7.4 Deques  283  A deque  pronounced “deck”  is very similar to a vector. It manages its elements with a dynamic array, provides random access, and has almost the same interface as a vector. The difference is that with a deque, the dynamic array is open at both ends. Thus, a deque is fast for insertions and deletions at both the end and the beginning  Figure 7.3 .  Figure7.3. LogicalStructureofaDeque  To provide this ability, the deque is typically implemented as a bunch of individual blocks, with the ﬁrst block growing in one direction and the last block growing in the opposite direction  Figure 7.4 .  Figure7.4. InternalStructureofaDeque  To use a deque, you must include the header ﬁle  :  include    There, the type is deﬁned as a class template inside namespace std:  namespace std {  template <typename T,  class deque;  }  typename Allocator = allocator  >   284  Chapter 7: STL Containers  As with all sequence containers, the type of the elements is passed as a ﬁrst template parameter. The optional second template argument is the memory model, with allocator as the default  see Chapter 19 .  7.4.1 Abilities of Deques  jump between different blocks.  access and iterator movement are usually a bit slower.  only at the end . These operations are done in amortized constant time.  The abilities of deques differ from those of vectors as follows:   Inserting and removing elements is fast at both the beginning and the end  for vectors, it is fast   The internal structure has one more indirection to access the elements, so with deques, element   Iterators must be smart pointers of a special type rather than ordinary pointers because they must   In systems that have size limitations for blocks of memory  for example, some PC systems , a deque might contain more elements because it uses more than one block of memory. Thus, max_size   might be larger for deques.   Deques provide no support to control the capacity and the moment of reallocation. In particular, any insertion or deletion of elements other than at the beginning or end invalidates all pointers, references, and iterators that refer to elements of the deque. However, reallocation may perform better than for vectors because according to their typical internal structure, deques don’t have to copy all elements on reallocation.   Blocks of memory might get freed when they are no longer used, so the memory size of a deque  might shrink  however, whether and how this happens is implementation speciﬁc .  end may be moved to make room or to ﬁll a gap.  The following features of vectors apply also to deques:   Inserting and deleting elements in the middle is relatively slow because all elements up to either   Iterators are random-access iterators. In summary, you should prefer a deque if the following are true:   You insert and remove elements at both ends  this is the classic case for a queue .   You don’t refer to elements of the container.   It is important that the container frees memory when it is no longer used  however, the standard  does not guarantee that this happens .  The interface of vectors and deques is almost the same, so trying both is very easy when no special feature of a vector or a deque is necessary.   7.4 Deques  285  7.4.2 Deque Operations  Tables 7.16 through 7.18 list all operations provided for deques.8  deque  c c2   deque  c = c2  Operation deque  c  Effect Default constructor; creates an empty deque without any elements Copy constructor; creates a new deque as a copy of c2  all elements are copied  Copy constructor; creates a new deque as a copy of c2  all elements are copied  Move constructor; creates a new deque, taking the contents of the rvalue rv  since C++11  Move constructor; creates a new deque, taking the contents of the rvalue rv  since C++11  Creates a deque with n elements created by the default constructor Creates a deque initialized with n copies of element elem deque  c n,elem  deque  c beg,end  Creates a deque initialized with the elements of the range  deque  c = rv  deque  c rv   deque  c n   deque  c initlist   deque  c = initlist  c.~deque    [beg,end  Creates a deque initialized with the elements of initializer list initlist  since C++11  Creates a deque initialized with the elements of initializer list initlist  since C++11  Destroys all elements and frees the memory  Table7.16. ConstructorsandDestructorofDeques  Deque operations differ from vector operations in only two ways: 1. Deques do not provide the functions for capacity  capacity   and reserve   . 2. Deques do provide direct functions to insert and to delete the ﬁrst element  push_front   and  pop_front   .  Because the other operations are the same, they are not explained again here. See Section 7.3.2, page 273, for a description of them.  Note, however, that shrink_to_fit   was added with C++11 as nonbinding request to shrink the internal memory to ﬁt the number of elements. You might argue that shrink_to_fit   makes no sense for deques because they are allowed to free blocks of memory. However, the memory that contains all the pointers to the blocks of memory usually does not shrink, which might change with this call.  8 shrink_to_fit   manipulates the deque because it invalidates references, pointers, and iterators to ele- ments. However, it is listed as a nonmodifying operation because it does not manipulate the logical contents of the container.   286  Chapter 7: STL Containers  Operation c.empty    Effect Returns whether the container is empty  equivalent to size  ==0 but might be faster  Returns the current number of elements Returns the maximum number of elements possible  c.size   c.max_size   c.shrink_to_fit   Request to reduce capacity to ﬁt number of elements  since C++11 8 c1 == c2 c1 != c2 c1 < c2 c1 > c2 c1 <= c2  Returns whether c1 is equal to c2  calls == for the elements  Returns whether c1 is not equal to c2  equivalent to ! c1==c2   Returns whether c1 is less than c2 Returns whether c1 is greater than c2  equivalent to c2<c1  Returns whether c1 is less than or equal to c2  equivalent to ! c2<c1   Returns whether c1 is greater than or equal to c2  equivalent to ! c1<c2   Returns the element with index idx  no range checking  Returns the element with index idx  throws range-error exception if idx is out of range  Returns the ﬁrst element  no check whether a ﬁrst element exists  Returns the last element  no check whether a last element exists  Returns a random-access iterator for the ﬁrst element Returns a random-access iterator for the position after the last element Returns a constant random-access iterator for the ﬁrst element  since C++11  Returns a constant random-access iterator for the position after the last element  since C++11  Returns a reverse iterator for the ﬁrst element of a reverse iteration Returns a reverse iterator for the position after the last element of a reverse iteration Returns a constant reverse iterator for the ﬁrst element of a reverse iteration  since C++11  Returns a constant reverse iterator for the position after the last element of a reverse iteration  since C++11   c1 >= c2  c[idx] c.at idx   c.front   c.back   c.begin   c.end   c.cbegin    c.cend    c.rbegin   c.rend    c.crbegin    c.crend    Table7.17. NonmodifyingOperationsofDeques  In addition, note that you still must consider the following: 1. No member functions for element access  except at    check whether an index or an iterator is  valid.  2. An insertion or deletion of elements might cause a reallocation. Thus, any insertion or deletion invalidates all pointers, references, and iterators that refer to other elements of the deque. The exception is when elements are inserted at the front or the back. In this case, references and pointers to elements stay valid, but iterators don’t.   7.4 Deques  Operation c = c2 c = rv c = initlist  c.assign n,elem  c.assign beg,end  c.assign initlist  c1.swap c2  swap c1,c2  c.push_back elem  c.pop_back   c.push_front elem  c.pop_front   c.insert pos,elem   c.insert pos,n,elem   c.insert pos,beg,end   c.insert pos,initlist   c.emplace pos,args...   c.emplace_back args...   c.emplace_front args...   c.erase pos   c.erase beg,end   c.resize num   c.resize num,elem   c.clear    287  Effect Assigns all elements of c2 to c Move assigns all elements of the rvalue rv to c  since C++11  Assigns all elements of the initializer list initlist to c  since C++11  Assigns n copies of element elem Assigns the elements of the range [beg,end  Assigns all the elements of the initializer list initlist Swaps the data of c1 and c2 Swaps the data of c1 and c2 Appends a copy of elem at the end Removes the last element  does not return it  Inserts a copy of elem at the beginning Removes the ﬁrst element  does not return it  Inserts a copy of elem before iterator position pos and returns the position of the new element Inserts n copies of elem before iterator position pos and returns the position of the ﬁrst new element  or pos if there is no new element  Inserts a copy of all elements of the range [beg,end  before iterator position pos and returns the position of the ﬁrst new element  or pos if there is no new element  Inserts a copy of all elements of the initializer list initlist before iterator position pos and returns the position of the ﬁrst new element  or pos if there is no new element; since C++11  Inserts a copy of an element initialized with args before iterator position pos and returns the position of the new element  since C++11  Appends a copy of an element initialized with args at the end  returns nothing; since C++11  Inserts a copy of an element initialized with args at the beginning  returns nothing; since C++11  Removes the element at iterator position pos and returns the position of the next element Removes all elements of the range [beg,end  and returns the position of the next element Changes the number of elements to num  if size   grows new elements are created by their default constructor  Changes the number of elements to num  if size   grows new elements are copies of elem  Removes all elements  empties the container   Table7.18. ModifyingOperationsofDeques   288  Chapter 7: STL Containers  7.4.3 Exception Handling  In principle, deques provide the same support for exception handing that vectors do  see Sec- tion 7.3.4, page 278 . The additional operations push_front   and pop_front   behave accord- ing to push_back   and pop_back  , respectively. Thus, the C++ standard library provides the following behavior:   If an element gets inserted with push_back   or push_front   and an exception occurs, these   Neither pop_back   nor pop_front   throws any exceptions. See Section 6.12.2, page 248, for a general discussion of exception handling in the STL.  functions have no effect.  7.4.4 Examples of Using Deques  The following program shows the abilities of deques:     cont deque1.cpp  include   include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {     create empty deque of strings deque  coll;     insert several elements coll.assign  3, string "string"  ; coll.push_back  "last string" ; coll.push_front  "first string" ;     print elements separated by newlines copy  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  ostream_iterator  cout,"\n"  ;  cout << endl;     remove ﬁrst and last element coll.pop_front  ; coll.pop_back  ;   7.4 Deques  289     insert ‘‘another’’ into every element but the ﬁrst for  unsigned i=1; i<coll.size  ; ++i  {  coll[i] = "another " + coll[i];  }     change size to four elements coll.resize  4, "resized string" ;     print elements separated by newlines copy  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  ostream_iterator  cout,"\n"  ;  The program has the following output:  }  first string string string string last string  string another string another string resized string   290  7.5 Lists  Chapter 7: STL Containers  A list  an instance of the container class list   manages its elements as a doubly linked list  Figure 7.5 . As usual, the C++ standard library does not specify the kind of the implementation, but it follows from the list’s name, constraints, and speciﬁcations.  Figure7.5. StructureofaList  To use a list, you must include the header ﬁle  :  include    There, the type is deﬁned as a class template inside namespace std:  namespace std {  template <typename T,  class list;  }  typename Allocator = allocator  >  The elements of a list may have any type T. The optional second template parameter deﬁnes the memory model  see Chapter 19 . The default memory model is the model allocator, which is provided by the C++ standard library.  7.5.1 Abilities of Lists  The internal structure of a list is totally different from that of an array, a vector, or a deque. The list object itself provides two pointers, the so-called anchors, which refer to the ﬁrst and last elements. Each element has pointers to the previous and next elements  or back to the anchor . To insert a new element, you just manipulate the corresponding pointers  see Figure 7.6 .  1   2   1   2   3   Figure7.6. InternalStructureofaListwhenAppendingaValue   7.5 Lists  291  Thus, a list differs in several major ways from arrays, vectors, and deques:   A list does not provide random access. For example, to access the ﬁfth element, you must navigate the ﬁrst four elements, following the chain of links. Thus, accessing an arbitrary element using a list is slow. However, you can navigate through the list from both end. So accessing both the ﬁrst and the last elements is fast.   Inserting and removing elements is fast at each position  provided you are there , and not only at one or both ends. You can always insert and delete an element in constant time, because no other elements have to be moved. Internally, only some pointer values are manipulated.   Inserting and deleting elements does not invalidate pointers, references, and iterators to other   A list supports exception handling in such a way that almost every operation succeeds or is a no-op. Thus, you can’t get into an intermediate state in which only half of the operation is complete.  elements.  and pop_back  .  The member functions provided for lists reﬂect these differences from arrays, vectors, and deques as follows:   Lists provide front  , push_front  , and pop_front  , as well as back  , push_back  ,   Lists provide neither a subscript operator nor at  , because no random access is provided.   Lists don’t provide operations for capacity or reallocation, because neither is needed. Each   Lists provide many special member functions for moving and removing elements. These member functions are faster versions of general algorithms that have the same names. They are faster because they only redirect pointers rather than copy and move the values.  element has its own memory that stays valid until the element is deleted.  7.5.2 List Operations  Create, Copy, and Destroy  Nonmodifying Operations  Assignments  The ability to create, copy, and destroy lists is the same as it is for every sequence container. See Table 7.19 for the list operations that do this. See also Section 7.1.2, page 254, for some remarks about possible initialization sources.  Lists provide the usual operations for size and comparisons. See Table 7.20 for a list and Sec- tion 7.1.2, page 254, for details.  Lists also provide the usual assignment operations for sequence containers  Table 7.21 . As usual, the insert operations match the constructors to provide different sources for initialization  see Sec- tion 7.1.2, page 254, for details .   292  Chapter 7: STL Containers  list  c c2   list  c = c2  Operation list  c  Effect Default constructor; creates an empty list without any elements Copy constructor; creates a new list as a copy of c2  all elements are copied  Copy constructor; creates a new list as a copy of c2  all elements are copied  Move constructor; creates a new list, taking the contents of the rvalue rv  since C++11  Move constructor; creates a new list, taking the contents of the rvalue rv  since C++11  Creates a list with n elements created by the default constructor Creates a list initialized with n copies of element elem list  c n,elem  list  c beg,end  Creates a list initialized with the elements of the range  list  c = rv  list  c rv   list  c n   list  c initlist   list  c = initlist  c.~list    [beg,end  Creates a list initialized with the elements of initializer list initlist  since C++11  Creates a list initialized with the elements of initializer list initlist  since C++11  Destroys all elements and frees the memory  Table7.19.

NonmodifyingOperationsofLists  Element Access  To access all elements of a list, you must use range-based for loops  see Section 3.1.4, page 17 , spe- ciﬁc operations, or iterators. Because it does not have random access, a list provides only front   and back   for accessing elements directly  Table 7.22 .   7.5 Lists  293  Effect Assigns all elements of c2 to c Move assigns all elements of the rvalue rv to c  since C++11  Assigns all elements of the initializer list initlist to c  since C++11  Assigns n copies of element elem  Operation c = c2 c = rv c = initlist c.assign n,elem  c.assign beg,end  Assigns the elements of the range [beg,end  c.assign initlist  c1.swap c2  swap c1,c2   Assigns all the elements of the initializer list initlist Swaps the data of c1 and c2 Swaps the data of c1 and c2  Table7.21. AssignmentOperationsofLists  Effect  Operation c.front   Returns the ﬁrst element  no check whether a ﬁrst element exists  Returns the last element  no check whether a last element exists  c.back    Table7.22. DirectElementAccessofLists  As usual, these operations do not check whether the container is empty. If the container is empty, calling these operations results in undeﬁned behavior. Thus, the caller must ensure that the container contains at least one element. For example:  std::list  coll;  std::cout << coll.front  ;     empty!    RUNTIME ERROR ⇒ undeﬁned behavior  if  !coll.empty    {  std::cout << coll.back  ;     OK  }  Note that this code is OK only in single-threaded environments. In multithreaded contexts, you need synchronization mechanisms to ensure that coll is not modiﬁed between the check for its size and the access to the element  see Section 18.4.3, page 984, for details .  Iterator Functions  To access all elements of a list, you must use iterators. Lists provide the usual iterator functions  Table 7.23 . However, because a list has no random access, these iterators are only bidirectional. Thus, you can’t call algorithms that require random-access iterators. All algorithms that manipulate the order of elements a lot, especially sorting algorithms, are in this category. However, for sorting the elements, lists provide the special member function sort    see Section 8.8.1, page 422 .   294  Chapter 7: STL Containers  Operation c.begin   c.end   c.cbegin   c.cend    c.rbegin   c.rend    Effect Returns a bidirectional iterator for the ﬁrst element Returns a bidirectional iterator for the position after the last element Returns a constant bidirectional iterator for the ﬁrst element  since C++11  Returns a constant bidirectional iterator for the position after the last element  since C++11  Returns a reverse iterator for the ﬁrst element of a reverse iteration Returns a reverse iterator for the position after the last element of a reverse iteration  c.crbegin   Returns a constant reverse iterator for the ﬁrst element of a reverse  c.crend    iteration  since C++11  Returns a constant reverse iterator for the position after the last element of a reverse iteration  since C++11   Table7.23. IteratorOperationsofLists  Inserting and Removing Elements  Table 7.24 shows the operations provided for lists to insert and to remove elements. Lists provide all functions of deques, supplemented by special implementations of the remove   and remove_if   algorithms.  As usual when using the STL, you must ensure that the arguments are valid. Iterators must refer  to valid positions, and the beginning of a range must have a position that is not behind the end.  Inserting and removing is faster if, when working with multiple elements, you use a single call  for all elements rather than multiple calls.  For removing elements, lists provide special implementations of the remove   algorithms  see Section 11.7.1, page 575 . These member functions are faster than the remove   algorithms be- cause they manipulate only internal pointers rather than the elements. So, unlike with vectors or deques, you should call remove   as a member function and not as an algorithm  see Section 7.3.2, page 276, for details . To remove all elements that have a certain value, you can do the following  see Section 6.7.3, page 223, for further details :  std::list  coll; ...    remove all elements with value val coll.remove val ;  However, to remove only the ﬁrst occurrence of a value, you must use an algorithm such as that mentioned for vectors in Section 7.3.2, page 277.  You can use remove_if   to deﬁne the criterion for the removal of the elements by a function or a function object. remove_if   removes each element for which calling the passed operation yields true. An example of the use of remove_if   is a statement to remove all elements that have an even value:   7.5 Lists  295  Operation c.push_back elem  c.pop_back   c.push_front elem  c.pop_front   c.insert pos,elem   c.insert pos,n,elem   c.insert pos,beg,end   c.insert pos,initlist   c.emplace pos,args...   c.emplace_back args...   c.emplace_front args...   c.erase pos   c.erase beg,end   c.remove val  c.remove_if op  c.resize num   c.resize num,elem   c.clear    Effect Appends a copy of elem at the end Removes the last element  does not return it  Inserts a copy of elem at the beginning Removes the ﬁrst element  does not return it  Inserts a copy of elem before iterator position pos and returns the position of the new element Inserts n copies of elem before iterator position pos and returns the position of the ﬁrst new element  or pos if there is no new element  Inserts a copy of all elements of the range [beg,end  before iterator position pos and returns the position of the ﬁrst new element  or pos if there is no new element  Inserts a copy of all elements of the initializer list initlist before iterator position pos and returns the position of the ﬁrst new element  or pos if there is no new element; since C++11  Inserts a copy of an element initialized with args before iterator position pos and returns the position of the new element  since C++11  Appends a copy of an element initialized with args at the end  returns nothing; since C++11  Inserts a copy of an element initialized with args at the beginning  returns nothing; since C++11  Removes the element at iterator position pos and returns the position of the next element Removes all elements of the range [beg,end  and returns the position of the next element Removes all elements with value val Removes all elements for which op elem  yields true Changes the number of elements to num  if size   grows new elements are created by their default constructor  Changes the number of elements to num  if size   grows new elements are copies of elem  Removes all elements  empties the container   Table7.24. InsertandRemoveOperationsofLists     remove all even elements coll.remove_if  []  int i  {  return i % 2 == 0;  } ;   296  Chapter 7: STL Containers  Here, a lambda is used to ﬁnd out which elements to remove. Because the lambda returns, whether a passed element is even, the statement as a whole removes all even elements. See Section 11.7.1, page 575, for additional examples of remove   and remove_if  .  The following operations do not invalidate iterators and references to other members: insert  , emplace  , emplace...  , push_front  , push_back  , pop_front  , pop_back  , and erase  .  Splice Functions and Functions to Change the Order of Elements  Linked lists have the advantage that you can remove and insert elements at any position in constant time. If you move elements from one container to another, this advantage doubles in that you need only redirect some internal pointers  Figure 7.7 .  Figure7.7. SpliceOperationstoChangetheOrderofListElements  To support this ability, lists provide not only remove   but also additional modifying member functions to change the order of and relink elements and ranges. You can call these operations to move elements inside a single list or between two lists, provided that the lists have the same type. Table 7.25 lists these functions. They are covered in detail in Section 8.8, page 420, with examples on page 298.  7.5.3 Exception Handling  Lists have the best support of exception safety of the standard containers in the STL. Almost all list operations will either succeed or have no effect. The only operations that don’t give this guarantee in the face of exceptions are assignment operations and the member function sort    they give the usual “basic guarantee” that they will not leak resources or violate container invariants in the face of exceptions . merge  , remove  , remove_if  , and unique   give guarantees under the condition that comparing the elements  using operator == or the predicate  doesn’t throw. Thus, to use a term from database programming, you could say that lists are transaction safe, provided that you don’t call assignment operations or sort   and that you ensure that comparing elements doesn’t throw. Table 7.26 lists all operations that give special guarantees in the face of exceptions. See Section 6.12.2, page 248, for a general discussion of exception handling in the STL.   7.5 Lists  297  c.splice pos,c2,c2pos  Moves the element at c2pos in c2 in front of pos of list c  Operation c.unique    c.unique op   c.splice pos,c2   c.splice pos,c2,  c2beg,c2end   c.sort   c.sort op  c.merge c2   c.merge c2,op   c.reverse    Effect Removes duplicates of consecutive elements with the same value Removes duplicates of consecutive elements, for which op   yields true Moves all elements of c2 to c in front of the iterator position pos   c and c2 may be identical  Moves all elements of the range [c2beg,c2end  in c2 in front of pos of list c  c and c2 may be identical  Sorts all elements with operator < Sorts all elements with op   Assuming that both containers contain the elements sorted, moves all elements of c2 into c so that all elements are merged and still sorted Assuming that both containers contain the elements sorted due to the sorting criterion op  , moves all elements of c2 into c so that all elements are merged and still sorted according to op   Reverses the order of all elements  Table7.25.

As usual, the C++ standard li- brary does not specify the kind of the implementation, but it follows from the forward list’s name, constraints, and speciﬁcations.  Figure7.8. StructureofaForwardList  To use a forward list, you must include the header ﬁle  :  There, the type is deﬁned as a class template inside namespace std:  include    namespace std {  template <typename T,  class forward_list;  }  typename Allocator = allocator  >  The elements of a forward list may have any type T. The optional second template parameter deﬁnes the memory model  see Chapter 19 . The default memory model is the model allocator, which is provided by the C++ standard library.  7.6.1 Abilities of Forward Lists  Forward lists have the following limitations compared to lists:  Conceptionally, a forward list is a list  object of class list   restricted such that it is not able to iterate backward. It provides no functionality that is not also provided by lists. As beneﬁts, it uses less memory and provides slightly better runtime behavior. The standard states: “It is intended that forward_list have zero space or time overhead relative to a hand-written C-style singly linked list. Features that would conﬂict with that goal have been omitted.”   A forward list provides only forward iterators, not bidirectional iterators. As a consequence, no reverse iterator support is provided, which means that types, such as reverse_iterator, and member functions, such as rbegin  , rend  , crbegin  , and crend  , are not provided.   A forward list does not provide a size   member function. This is a consequence of omitting   The anchor of a forward list has no pointer to the last element. For this reason, a forward list does not provide the special member functions to deal with the last element, back  , push_back  , and pop_back  .  features that create time or space overhead relative to a handwritten singly linked list.   7.6 Forward Lists  301    For all member functions that modify forward lists in a way that elements are inserted or deleted at a speciﬁc position, special versions for forward lists are provided. The reason is that you have to pass the position of the element before the ﬁrst element that gets manipulated, because there you have to assign a new successor element. Because you can’t navigate backwards  at least not in constant time , for all these member functions you have to pass the position of the preceding element. Because of this difference, these member functions have a _after sufﬁx in their name. For example, instead of insert  , insert_after   is provided, which inserts new elements after the element passed as ﬁrst argument; that is, it appends an element at that position.   For this reason, forward lists provide before_begin   and cbefore_begin  , which yield the position of a virtual element before the ﬁrst element  technically speaking, the anchor of the linked list , which can be used to let built-in algorithms ending with _after exchange even the ﬁrst element.  Other than these differences, forward lists behave just like lists:  The decision not to provide size   might be especially surprising because size   is one of the operations required for all STL containers  see Section 7.1.2, page 254 . Here, you can see the consequences of the design goal to have “zero space or time overhead relative to a hand-written C- style singly linked list.” The alternative would have been either to compute the size each time size   is called, which would have linear complexity, or to provide an additional ﬁeld in the forward_list object for the size, which is updated with each and every operation that changes the number of elements. As the design paper for the forward list, [N2543:FwdList], mentions: “It’s a cost that all users would have to pay for, whether they need this feature or not.” So, if you need the size, either track it outside the forward_list or use a list instead.   A forward list does not provide random access. For example, to access the ﬁfth element, you must navigate the ﬁrst four elements, following the chain of links. Thus, using a forward list to access an arbitrary element is slow.   Inserting and removing elements is fast at each position, if you are there. You can always insert and delete an element in constant time, because no other elements have to be moved. Internally, only some pointer values are manipulated.   Inserting and deleting elements does not invalidate iterators, references, and pointers to other   A forward list supports exception handling in such a way that almost every operation succeeds or is a no-op. Thus, you can’t get into an intermediate state in which only half of the operation is complete.   Forward lists provide many special member functions for moving and removing elements. These member functions are faster versions of general algorithms, because they only redirect pointers rather than copy and move the values. However, when element positions are involved, you have to pass the preceding position, and the member function has the sufﬁx _after in its name.  elements.   302  Chapter 7: STL Containers  7.6.2 Forward List Operations  Create, Copy, and Destroy  The ability to create, copy, and destroy forward lists is the same as it is for every sequence container. See Table 7.27 for the forward list operations that do this. See also Section 7.1.2, page 254, for some remarks about possible initialization sources.

ConstructorsandDestructorofForwardLists  Nonmodifying Operations  With one exception, forward lists provide the usual operations for size and comparisons: Forward lists provide no size   operation. The reason is that it is not possible to store or compute the current number of elements in constant time. And to make the fact visible that size   is an expensive oper- ation, it is not provided. If you have to compute the number of elements, you can use distance    see Section 9.3.3, page 445 :  include   include     7.6 Forward Lists  303  std::forward_list  l; ... std::cout << "l.size  : " << std::distance l.begin  ,l.end     << std::endl;  But note that distance   is a call with linear complexity here.  See Table 7.28 for a complete list of the nonmodifying operations of forward lists and Sec-  tion 7.1.2, page 254, for more details about the other operations.  Effect Returns whether the container is empty  Operation c.empty   c.max_size   Returns the maximum number of elements possible c1 == c2 c1 != c2 c1 < c2 c1 > c2 c1 <= c2 c1 >= c2  Returns whether c1 is equal to c2  calls == for the elements  Returns whether c1 is not equal to c2  equivalent to ! c1==c2   Returns whether c1 is less than c2 Returns whether c1 is greater than c2  equivalent to c2<c1  Returns whether c1 is less than or equal to c2  equivalent to ! c2<c1   Returns whether c1 is greater than or equal to c2  equivalent to ! c1<c2    Table7.28. NonmodifyingOperationsofForwardLists  Assignments  Forward lists also provide the usual assignment operations for sequence containers  Table 7.29 . As usual, the insert operations match the constructors to provide different sources for initialization  see Section 7.1.2, page 254, for details .  Effect Assigns all elements of c2 to c Move assigns all elements of the rvalue rv to c  since C++11  Assigns all elements of the initializer list initlist to c  since C++11  Assigns n copies of element elem  Operation c = c2 c = rv c = initlist c.assign n,elem  c.assign beg,end  Assigns the elements of the range [beg,end  c.assign initlist  c1.swap c2  swap c1,c2   Assigns all the elements of the initializer list initlist Swaps the data of c1 and c2 Swaps the data of c1 and c2  Table7.29. AssignmentOperationsofForwardLists   304  Element Access  Chapter 7: STL Containers  To access all elements of a forward list, you must use range-based for loops  see Section 3.1.4, page 17 , speciﬁc operations, or iterators. In contrast to lists, the only element you can access directly is the ﬁrst element, if any. For this reason, only front   is provided to access elements directly  Table 7.30 .  Operation c.front   Returns the ﬁrst element  no check whether a ﬁrst element exists   Effect  Table7.30. DirectElementAccessofForwardLists  As usual, this operation does not check whether the container is empty. If the container is empty, calling front   results in undeﬁned behavior. In addition, in multithreaded contexts, you need synchronization mechanisms to ensure that coll is not modiﬁed between the check for its size and the access to an element  see Section 18.4.3, page 984 .  Iterator Functions  To access all elements of a forward list, you must use iterators. However, because you can traverse elements only in forward order, the iterators are forward iterators, and no support for reverse iterators is provided  Table 7.31 .  Thus, you can’t call algorithms that require bidirectional iterators or random-access iterators. All algorithms that manipulate the order of elements a lot, especially sorting algorithms, are in this category. However, for sorting the elements, forward lists provide the special member function sort    see Section 8.8.1, page 422 .  In addition, before_begin   and cbefore_begin   are provided to yield the position of a virtual element before the ﬁrst element, which is necessary to be able to modify the next element even if the next element is the ﬁrst element.  Operation c.begin   c.end   c.cbegin    Effect Returns a bidirectional iterator for the ﬁrst element Returns a bidirectional iterator for the position after the last element Returns a constant bidirectional iterator for the ﬁrst element  since C++11  Returns a constant bidirectional iterator for the position after the last element  since C++11  Returns a forward iterator for the position before the ﬁrst element c.before_begin   c.cbefore_begin   Returns a constant forward iterator for the position before the ﬁrst  c.cend    element  Table7.31. IteratorOperationsofForwardLists   7.6 Forward Lists  305  Note that before_begin   and cbefore_begin   do not represent a valid position of a for- ward list. Therefore, dereferencing these positions results in undeﬁned behavior. Thus, using any ordinary algorithm with before_begin   as ﬁrst argument passed results in a runtime error:     RUNTIME ERROR: before_begin   is only valid with ..._after   operations std::copy  fwlist.before_begin  , fwlist.end  ,  ... ;  Besides copying and assignments, the only valid operations for return values of before_begin   are ++, ==, and !=.  Inserting and Removing Elements  First, the usual general hints apply:  Table 7.32 shows the operations provided for forward lists to insert and to remove elements. Due to the nature of lists in general and forward lists in particular, we have to discuss them in detail.   As usual when using the STL, you must ensure that the arguments are valid. Iterators must refer to valid positions, and the beginning of a range must have a position that is not behind the end.   Inserting and removing is faster if, when working with multiple elements, you use a single call  for all elements rather than multiple calls.  Then, as for lists, forward lists provide special implementations of the remove   algorithms  see Section 11.7.1, page 575 . These member functions are faster than the remove   algorithms because they manipulate only internal pointers rather than the elements. For more details, see the description of these operations for lists in Section 7.5.2, page 294.  Note that for all the insert, emplace, and erase member functions provided for forward lists, you have a problem: They usually get a position of an element, where you have to insert a new element or must delete. But this requires a modiﬁcation of the preceding element, because there the pointer to the next element has to get modiﬁed. For lists, you can just go backward to the previous element to manipulate it, but for forward lists, you can’t. For this reason, the member functions behave differently than for lists, which is reﬂected by the name of the member functions. All end with _after, which means that they insert a new element after the one passed  i.e., they append  or delete the element after the element passed.  In combination with before_begin   to ensure that the ﬁrst element is covered, when you use  these member functions, a typical access of forward lists is as follows  see Figure 7.9 :  std::forward_list  fwlist = { 1, 2, 3 };     insert 77, 88, and 99 at the beginning: fwlist.insert_after  fwlist.before_begin  ,  { 77, 88, 99 }  ;     position    values  Note that calling an _after member function with end   or cend   results in undeﬁned behavior because to append a new element at the end of a forward list, you have to pass the position of the last element  or before_begin   if none :     RUNTIME ERROR: appending element after end is undeﬁned behavior fwlist.insert_after fwlist.end  ,9999 ;   306  Chapter 7: STL Containers  Effect Inserts a copy of elem at the beginning Removes the ﬁrst element  does not return it  Inserts a copy of elem after iterator position pos and returns the position of the new element Inserts n copies of elem after iterator position pos and returns the position of the ﬁrst new element  or pos if there is no new element  Inserts a copy of all elements of the range [beg,end  after iterator position pos and returns the position of the ﬁrst new element  or pos if there is no new element  Inserts a copy of all elements of the initializer list initlist after iterator position pos and returns the position of the ﬁrst new element  or pos if there is no new element  Inserts a copy of an element initialized with args after iterator position pos and returns the position of the new element  since C++11  Inserts a copy of an element initialized with args at the beginning  returns nothing; since C++11  Removes the element after iterator position pos  returns nothing  Removes all elements of the range [beg,end   returns nothing  Removes all elements with value val Removes all elements for which op elem  yields true Changes the number of elements to num  if size   grows new elements are created by their default constructor  Changes the number of elements to num  if size   grows new elements are copies of elem  Removes all elements  empties the container   Operation c.push_front elem  c.pop_front   c.insert_after pos,elem   c.insert_after pos,n,elem   c.insert_after pos,beg,end   c.insert_after pos,initlist   c.emplace_after pos,args...   c.emplace_front args...   c.erase_after pos   c.erase_after beg,end   c.remove val  c.remove_if op  c.resize num   c.resize num,elem   c.clear    before_begin     begin     Table7.32.

InsertingElementsattheBeginningofaForwardList   7.6 Forward Lists  Find and Remove or Insert  307  The drawbacks of having a singly linked list, where you can only traverse forward, gets even worse when trying to ﬁnd an element to insert or delete something there. The problem is that when you ﬁnd the element, you are too far, because to insert or delete something there you have to manipulate the element before the element you are searching for. For this reason, you have to ﬁnd an element by determining whether the next element ﬁts a speciﬁc criterion. For example:     cont forwardlistfind1.cpp  include   include "print.hpp" using namespace std;  int main   {  forward_list  list = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 97, 98, 99 };     ﬁnd the position before the ﬁrst even element auto posBefore = list.before_begin  ; for  auto pos=list.begin  ; pos!=list.end  ; ++pos, ++posBefore  {  if  *pos % 2 == 0  {  break;     element found  }  }  }     and insert a new element in front of the ﬁrst even element list.insert_after posBefore,42 ; PRINT_ELEMENTS list ;  Here, pos iterates over the list to ﬁnd a speciﬁc element, whereas posBefore is always before pos to be able to return the position of the element before the element searched for  see Figure 7.10 . So, the program has the following output:  1 42 2 3 4 5 97 98 99  Alternatively, you can use the next   convenience function for iterators, which is available since C++11  see Section 9.3.2, page 443 :  include   ... auto posBefore = list.before_begin  ; for   ; next posBefore !=list.end  ; ++posBefore  {  if  *next posBefore  % 2 == 0  {  break;     element found  }  }   308  Chapter 7: STL Containers  list:    1   2   3   4   5   97   98   99   begin     ++pos   before_begin     ++posBefore   Figure7.10. SearchingforaPositiontoInsertorDelete  If this is something you need more often, you might deﬁne your own algorithms to ﬁnd a position before the element that has a speciﬁc value or fulﬁlls a speciﬁc condition:     cont findbefore.hpp  template   inline InputIterator find_before  InputIterator first, InputIterator last, const Tp& val  {  if  first==last  {  return first;  } InputIterator next first ; ++next; while  next!=last && ! *next==val   {  ++next; ++first;  } return first;  if  first==last  {  return first;  } InputIterator next first ; ++next; while  next!=last && !pred *next   {  ++next; ++first;  } return first;  }  }  template   inline InputIterator find_before_if  InputIterator first, InputIterator last, Pred pred  {   7.6 Forward Lists  309  With these algorithms, you can use lambdas to ﬁnd the corresponding position  for the complete example, see cont fwlistfind2.cpp :     ﬁnd the position before the ﬁrst even element auto posBefore = find_before_if  list.before_begin  , list.end  ,  []  int i  {  return i%2==0;  } ;     and insert a new element in front of it list.insert_after posBefore,42 ;  You have to call find_before_if   with the position returned by before_begin  . Otherwise, you skip the ﬁrst element. To avoid undeﬁned behavior if you pass begin  , the algorithms ﬁrst check whether the beginning of the range is equal to the end. A better approach would have been to let forward lists provide corresponding member functions, but this is, unfortunately, not the case.  Splice Functions and Functions to Change the Order of Elements  As with lists, forward lists have the advantage that you can remove and insert elements at any position in constant time. If you move elements from one container to another, this advantage doubles in that you need to redirect only some internal pointers. For this reason, forward lists provide almost the same member functions to splice lists or to change the order of elements. You can call these operations to move elements inside a single list or between two lists, provided that the lists have the same type. The only difference from lists is that splice_after   is provided instead of splice  , because the position of the element in front of the element where the splice applies is passed.  Table 7.33 lists these functions. They are covered in detail in Section 8.8, page 420. The follow- ing program demonstrates how to use the splice functions for forward lists. Here the ﬁrst element with value 3 in the forward list l1 is moved before the ﬁrst element with value 99 in l2:     cont forwardlistsplice1.cpp  include   include "print.hpp" using namespace std;  int main   {  forward_list  l1 = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }; forward_list  l2 = { 97, 98, 99 };     ﬁnd 3 in l1 auto pos1=l1.before_begin  ; for  auto pb1=l1.begin  ; pb1 != l1.end  ; ++pb1, ++pos1  {  if  *pb1 == 3  {  break;     found  }  }   310  Chapter 7: STL Containers     ﬁnd 99 in l2 auto pos2=l2.before_begin  ; for  auto pb2=l2.begin  ; pb2 != l2.end  ; ++pb2, ++pos2  {  if  *pb2 == 99  {    found  break;  }  }     splice 3 from l1 to l2 before 99 l1.splice_after pos2, l2,  pos1 ;     destination    source  PRINT_ELEMENTS l1,"l1: " ; PRINT_ELEMENTS l2,"l2: " ;  c.splice_after pos,c2,c2pos  Moves the element behind c2pos in c2 right after pos  c.splice_after pos,c2   c.splice_after pos,c2,  c2beg,c2end   }  Operation c.unique    c.unique op   c.sort   c.sort op  c.merge c2   c.merge c2,op   c.reverse    Effect Removes duplicates of consecutive elements with the same value Removes duplicates of consecutive elements, for which op   yields true Moves all elements of c2 to c right behind the iterator position pos  of forward list c  c and c2 may be identical  Moves all elements between c2beg and c2end  both not included  in c2 right after pos of forward list c  c and c2 may be identical  Sorts all elements with operator < Sorts all elements with op   Assuming that both containers contain the elements sorted, moves all elements of c2 into c so that all elements are merged and still sorted Assuming that both containers contain the elements sorted by the sorting criterion op  , moves all elements of c2 into c so that all elements are merged and still sorted according to op   Reverses the order of all elements  Table7.33. SpecialModifyingOperationsforForwardLists   7.6 Forward Lists  311  First, in l1 we search for the position before the ﬁrst element with value 3. Then, in l2 we search for the position before the ﬁrst element with value 99. Finally, with both positions splice_after   is called, which just modiﬁes the internal pointers in the lists  see Figure 7.11 .  l1:    l2:    1   2   3   4   5   1   2   3   4   5   97   98   99   97   98   99   l1:    l2:    Figure7.11. Effectofsplice_after   withForwardLists  Again, with our find_before   algorithms, the code looks a lot simpler:     splice 3 from l1 to l2 before 99 l1.splice_after l2.find_before 99 , l2,  l1.find_before 3  ;     destination    source  Note that source and destination for splice operations might be the same. Thus, you can move elements inside a forward list. However, note that calling splice_after   with end   results in undeﬁned behavior, as all _after functions do with end  :     RUNTIME ERROR: move ﬁrst element to the end is not possible that way    destination position fwlist.splice_after fwlist.end  ,    source list    source position  fwlist, fwlist.begin   ;  7.6.3 Exception Handling  Forward lists give the same guarantees that lists give regarding exception handling, provided that the corresponding member function is available. See Section 7.5.3, page 296, for details.   312  Chapter 7: STL Containers  7.6.4 Examples of Using Forward Lists  The following example shows the use of the special member functions for forward lists:     cont forwardlist1.cpp  include   include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  void printLists  const string& s, const forward_list & l1, const forward_list & l2   cout << s << endl; cout << " list1: "; copy  l1.cbegin  , l1.cend  , ostream_iterator  cout," "  ; cout << endl << " list2: "; copy  l2.cbegin  , l2.cend  , ostream_iterator  cout," "  ; cout << endl;  {  }  int main   {     create two forward lists forward_list  list1 = { 1, 2, 3, 4 }; forward_list  list2 = { 77, 88, 99 }; printLists  "initial:", list1, list2 ;     insert six new element at the beginning of list2 list2.insert_after list2.before_begin  ,99 ; list2.push_front 10 ; list2.insert_after list2.before_begin  , {10,11,12,13}  ; printLists  "6 new elems:", list1, list2 ;     insert all elements of list2 at the beginning of list1 list1.insert_after list1.before_begin  ,  printLists  "list2 into list1:", list1, list2 ;  list2.begin  ,list2.end   ;     delete second element and elements after element with value 99 list2.erase_after list2.begin   ;   7.6 Forward Lists  313  list2.erase_after find list2.begin  ,list2.end  ,  99 ,  list2.end   ;  printLists  "delete 2nd and after 99:", list1, list2 ;     sort list1, assign it to list2, and remove duplicates list1.sort  ; list2 = list1; list2.unique  ; printLists  "sorted and unique:", list1, list2 ;     merge both sorted lists into list1 list1.merge list2 ; printLists  "merged:", list1, list2 ;  }  The program has the following output:  initial:  list1: 1 2 3 4 list2: 77 88 99  6 new elems:  list1: 1 2 3 4 list2: 10 11 12 13 10 99 77 88 99  list2 into list1:  list1: 10 11 12 13 10 99 77 88 99 1 2 3 4 list2: 10 11 12 13 10 99 77 88 99  delete 2nd and after 99:  list1: 10 11 12 13 10 99 77 88 99 1 2 3 4 list2: 10 12 13 10 99  sorted and unique:  list1: 1 2 3 4 10 10 11 12 13 77 88 99 99 list2: 1 2 3 4 10 11 12 13 77 88 99  merged:  list1: 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 10 10 10 11 11 12 12 13 13 77 77 88 88 99 99 99 list2:  See Section 7.5.4, page 298, for a corresponding example using a list.   314  Chapter 7: STL Containers  7.7 Sets and Multisets  Set and multiset containers sort their elements automatically according to a certain sorting criterion. The difference between the two types of containers is that multisets allow duplicates, whereas sets do not  see Figure 7.12 and the earlier discussion on this topic in Chapter 6 .  Set:   Multiset:   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   1   2   2   2   3   4   5   5   Figure7.12. SetsandMultisets  To use a set or a multiset, you must include the header ﬁle  :  include    There, the types are deﬁned as class templates inside namespace std:  namespace std {  template <typename T,  typename Compare = less , typename Allocator = allocator  > class set;  template <typename T,  typename Compare = less , typename Allocator = allocator  > class multiset;  }  The elements of a set or a multiset may have any type T that is comparable according to the sorting criterion. The optional second template argument deﬁnes the sorting criterion. If a special sorting criterion is not passed, the default criterion less is used. The function object less sorts the elements by comparing them with operator <  see Section 10.2.1, page 487, for details about less . The optional third template parameter deﬁnes the memory model  see Chapter 19 . The default memory model is the model allocator, which is provided by the C++ standard library.  The sorting criterion must deﬁne strict weak ordering, which is deﬁned by the following four  properties:   7.7 Sets and Multisets  315  1.  2.  3.  4.  It has to be antisymmetric. This means that for operator <: If x < y is true, then y < x is false. This means that for a predicate op  : If op x,y  is true, then op y,x  is false. It has to be transitive. This means that for operator <: If x < y is true and y < z is true, then x < z is true. This means that for a predicate op  : If op x,y  is true and op y,z  is true, then op x,z  is true. It has to be irreﬂexive. This means that for operator <: x < x is always false. This means that for a predicate op  : op x,x  is always false. It has to have transitivity of equivalence, which means roughly: If a is equivalent to b and b is equivalent to c, then a is equivalent to c. This means that for operator <: If ! a<b  && ! b<a  is true and ! b<c  && ! c<b  is true then ! a<c  && ! c<a  is true. This means that for a predicate op  : If op a,b , op b,a , op b,c , and op c,b  all yield false, then op a,c  and op c,a  yield false.  Note that this means that you have to distinguish between less and equal. A criterion such as operator <= does not fulﬁll this requirement.  Based on these properties, the sorting criterion is also used to check equivalence. That is, two elements are considered to be duplicates if neither is less than the other  or if both op x,y  and op y,x  are false .  For multisets, the order of equivalent elements is random but stable. Thus, insertions and erasures  preserve the relative ordering of equivalent elements  guaranteed since C++11 .  7.7.1 Abilities of Sets and Multisets  Like all standardized associative container classes, sets and multisets are usually implemented as balanced binary trees  Figure 7.13 . The standard does not specify this, but it follows from the complexity of set and multiset operations.9  The major advantage of automatic sorting is that a binary tree performs well when elements with a certain value are searched. In fact, search functions have logarithmic complexity. For example, to search for an element in a set or a multiset of 1,000 elements, a tree search performed by a member function needs, on average, one-ﬁftieth of the comparisons of a linear search  which is performed by a search algorithm that iterates over all elements . See Section 2.2, page 10, for more details about complexity.  However, automatic sorting also imposes an important constraint on sets and multisets: You may not change the value of an element directly, because doing so might compromise the correct order.  9 In fact, sets and multisets are typically implemented as red-black trees, which are good for both changing the number of elements and searching for elements. They guarantee at most two internal relinks on insertions and that the longest path is at most twice as long as the shortest path to a leaf.   316  Chapter 7: STL Containers  7  4  9  2  5  8  11  1  3  6  10  12  Figure7.13. InternalStructureofSetsandMultisets  Therefore, to modify the value of an element, you must remove the element having the old value and insert a new element that has the new value. The interface reﬂects this behavior:   Sets and multisets don’t provide operations for direct element access.   Indirect access via iterators has the constraint that, from the iterator’s point of view, the element  value is constant.  7.7.2 Set and Multiset Operations  Create, Copy, and Destroy  Table 7.34 lists the constructors and destructors of sets and multisets. You can deﬁne the sorting criterion in two ways: 1. As a template parameter. For example:  std::set > coll;  In this case, the sorting criterion is part of the type. Thus, the type system ensures that only containers with the same sorting criterion can be combined. This is the usual way to specify the sorting criterion. To be more precise, the second parameter is the type of the sorting criterion. The concrete sorting criterion is the function object that gets created with the container. To do this, the constructor of the container calls the default constructor of the type of the sorting criterion. See Section 10.1.1, page 476, for an example that uses a user-deﬁned sorting criterion. 2. As a constructor parameter. In this case, you might have a type for several sorting criteria that allows having different initial values or states. This is useful when processing the sorting criterion at runtime and when sorting criteria are needed that are different but of the same data type. See Section 7.7.5, page 328, for a complete example.  If no special sorting criterion is passed, the default sorting criterion, function object less , is used, which sorts the elements by using operator <.  Note that the sorting criterion is also used to check for equivalence of two elements in the same container  i.e., to ﬁnd duplicates . Thus, when the default sorting criterion is used, the check for equivalence of two elements looks like this:  if  !  elem1<elem2  elem2<elem1     7.7 Sets and Multisets  317  Operation set c  set c op  set c c2   set c = c2  set c rv   set c = rv  set c beg,end   set c beg,end,op   set c initlist   set c = initlist  c.~set    Effect Default constructor; creates an empty set multiset without any elements Creates an empty set multiset that uses op as the sorting criterion Copy constructor; creates a copy of another set multiset of the same type  all elements are copied  Copy constructor; creates a copy of another set multiset of the same type  all elements are copied  Move constructor; creates a new set multiset of the same type, taking the contents of the rvalue rv  since C++11  Move constructor; creates a new set multiset of the same type, taking the contents of the rvalue rv  since C++11  Creates a set multiset initialized by the elements of the range [beg,end  Creates a set multiset with the sorting criterion op initialized by the elements of the range [beg,end  Creates a set multiset initialized with the elements of initializer list initlist  since C++11  Creates a set multiset initialized with the elements of initializer list initlist  since C++11  Destroys all elements and frees the memory  Here, set may be one of the following types:  set set  set  multiset  multiset  A multiset that by default sorts with Op  Effect A set that by default sorts with less   operator <  A set that by default sorts with Op A multiset that by default sorts with less   operator <   Table7.34. ConstructorsandDestructorsofSetsandMultisets  This has three advantages: 1. You need to pass only one argument as the sorting criterion. 2. You don’t have to provide operator == for the element type. 3. You can have contrary deﬁnitions between equivalence and equality  however, this might be a  source of confusion .  Checking for equivalence in this way takes a bit more time because two comparisons might be necessary to evaluate the previous expression. Note, however, that if the result of the ﬁrst comparison yields true, the second comparison is not evaluated.   318  Chapter 7: STL Containers  Note also that if two containers are compared by operator ==, the elements in both containers are compared using their operator ==, which means that operator == has to be provided for the element type.  The constructor for the beginning and the end of a range could be used to initialize the container with elements from containers that have other types, from arrays, or from the standard input. See Section 7.1.2, page 254, for details.  Nonmodifying Operations  Sets and multisets provide the usual nonmodifying operations to query the size and to make com- parisons  Table 7.35 .  Operation c.key_comp   c.value_comp   Returns the comparison criterion for values as a whole  same as  Effect Returns the comparison criterion  c.empty    c.size   c.max_size   c1 == c2 c1 != c2 c1 < c2 c1 > c2 c1 <= c2 c1 >= c2  key_comp    Returns whether the container is empty  equivalent to size  ==0 but might be faster  Returns the current number of elements Returns the maximum number of elements possible Returns whether c1 is equal to c2  calls == for the elements  Returns whether c1 is not equal to c2  equivalent to ! c1==c2   Returns whether c1 is less than c2 Returns whether c1 is greater than c2  equivalent to c2<c1  Returns whether c1 is less than or equal to c2  equivalent to ! c2<c1   Returns whether c1 is greater than or equal to c2  equivalent to ! c1<c2    Table7.35. NonmodifyingOperationsofSetsandMultisets  Comparisons are provided only for containers of the same type. Thus, the elements and the sorting criterion must have the same types; otherwise, a type error occurs at compile time. For example:  std::set  c1; std::set  > c2; ... if  c1 == c2  {     ERROR: different types     sorting criterion: std::less   ...  }  The check whether a container is less than another container is done by a lexicographical comparison  see Section 11.5.4, page 548 . To compare containers of different types  different sorting criteria , you must use the comparing algorithms in Section 11.5.4, page 542.   7.7 Sets and Multisets  Special Search Operations  319  Because they are optimized for fast searching of elements, sets and multisets provide special search functions  Table 7.36 . These functions are special versions of general algorithms that have the same name. You should always prefer the optimized versions for sets and multisets to achieve logarithmic complexity instead of the linear complexity of the general algorithms. For example, a search of a collection of 1,000 elements requires on average only 10 comparisons instead of 500  see Section 2.2, page 10 .  Operation c.count val  c.find val   Effect Returns the number of elements with value val Returns the position of the ﬁrst element with value val  or end   if none found   c.lower_bound val  Returns the ﬁrst position, where val would get inserted  c.upper_bound val  Returns the last position, where val would get inserted   the ﬁrst element >= val    the ﬁrst element > val   c.equal_range val  Returns a range with all elements with a value equal to val  i.e., the  ﬁrst and last position, where val would get inserted   Table7.36. SpecialSearchOperationsofSetsandMultisets  The find   member function searches the ﬁrst element that has the value that was passed as the argument and returns its iterator position. If no such element is found, find   returns end   of the container.  lower_bound   and upper_bound   return the ﬁrst and last position, respectively, at which an element with the passed value would be inserted. In other words, lower_bound   returns the position of the ﬁrst element that has the same or a greater value than the argument, whereas upper_bound   returns the position of the ﬁrst element with a greater value. equal_range   returns both return values of lower_bound   and upper_bound   as a pair  type pair is intro- duced in Section 5.1.1, page 60 . Thus, equal_range   returns the range of elements that have the same value as the argument. If lower_bound   or the ﬁrst value of equal_range   is equal to upper_bound   or the second value of equal_range  , no elements with the same value exist in the set or multiset. Naturally, the range of elements having the same values could contain at most one element in a set.  The following example shows how to use lower_bound  , upper_bound  ,  and  equal_range  :     cont setrange1.cpp  include   include   using namespace std;   320  Chapter 7: STL Containers  int main    {  set  c;  c.insert 1 ; c.insert 2 ; c.insert 4 ; c.insert 5 ; c.insert 6 ;  cout << "lower_bound 3 : " << *c.lower_bound 3  << endl; cout << "upper_bound 3 : " << *c.upper_bound 3  << endl; cout << "equal_range 3 : " << *c.equal_range 3 .first << " "  << *c.equal_range 3 .second << endl;  cout << endl; cout << "lower_bound 5 : " << *c.lower_bound 5  << endl; cout << "upper_bound 5 : " << *c.upper_bound 5  << endl; cout << "equal_range 5 : " << *c.equal_range 5 .first << " "  << *c.equal_range 5 .second << endl;  The output of the program is as follows:  }  lower_bound 3 : 4 upper_bound 3 : 4 equal_range 3 : 4 4  lower_bound 5 : 5 upper_bound 5 : 6 equal_range 5 : 5 6  Assignments  If you use a multiset instead of a set, the program has the same output.  As listed in Table 7.37, Sets and multisets provide only the fundamental assignment operations that all containers provide  see Section 7.1.2, page 258 .  For these operations, both containers must have the same type. In particular, the type of the comparison criteria must be the same, although the comparison criteria themselves may be different. See Section 7.7.5, page 328, for an example of different sorting criteria that have the same type. If the criteria are different, they will also get assigned or swapped.   7.7 Sets and Multisets  321  Operation c = c2 c = rv c = initlist c1.swap c2  swap c1,c2   Effect Assigns all elements of c2 to c Move assigns all elements of the rvalue rv to c  since C++11  Assigns all elements of the initializer list initlist to c  since C++11  Swaps the data of c1 and c2 Swaps the data of c1 and c2  Table7.37. AssignmentOperationsofSetsandMultisets  Iterator Functions  Sets and multisets do not provide direct element access, so you have to use range-based for loops  see Section 3.1.4, page 17  or iterators. Sets and multisets provide the usual member functions for iterators  Table 7.38 .  Operation c.begin   c.end   c.cbegin    c.cend    c.rbegin   c.rend    Effect Returns a bidirectional iterator for the ﬁrst element Returns a bidirectional iterator for the position after the last element Returns a constant bidirectional iterator for the ﬁrst element  since C++11  Returns a constant bidirectional iterator for the position after the last element  since C++11  Returns a reverse iterator for the ﬁrst element of a reverse iteration Returns a reverse iterator for the position after the last element of a reverse iteration  c.crbegin   Returns a constant reverse iterator for the ﬁrst element of a reverse  c.crend    iteration  since C++11  Returns a constant reverse iterator for the position after the last element of a reverse iteration  since C++11   Table7.38. IteratorOperationsofSetsandMultisets  As with all associative container classes, the iterators are bidirectional iterators  see Section 9.2.4, page 437 . Thus, you can’t use them in algorithms that are provided only for random-access iterators, such as algorithms for sorting or random shufﬂing.  More important is the constraint that, from an iterator’s point of view, all elements are consid- ered constant. This is necessary to ensure that you can’t compromise the order of the elements by changing their values. However, as a result, you can’t call any modifying algorithm on the elements of a set or a multiset. For example, you can’t call the remove   algorithm, because it “removes” by overwriting “removed” elements with the following elements  see Section 6.7.2, page 221, for a detailed discussion of this problem . To remove elements in sets and multisets, you can use only member functions provided by the container.   322  Chapter 7: STL Containers  Inserting and Removing Elements  Table 7.39 shows the operations provided for sets and multisets to insert and remove elements.  Operation c.insert val   c.insert pos,val   c.insert beg,end   c.insert initlist   c.emplace args...   c.erase val   c.erase pos   c.erase beg,end   c.clear    c.emplace_hint pos,args...   Effect Inserts a copy of val and returns the position of the new element and, for sets, whether it succeeded Inserts a copy of val and returns the position of the new element  pos is used as a hint pointing to where the insert should start the search  Inserts a copy of all elements of the range [beg,end   returns nothing  Inserts a copy of all elements in the initializer list initlist  returns nothing; since C++11  Inserts a copy of an element initialized with args and returns the position of the new element and, for sets, whether it succeeded  since C++11  Inserts a copy of an element initialized with args and returns the position of the new element  pos is used as a hint pointing to where the insert should start the search  Removes all elements equal to val and returns the number of removed elements Removes the element at iterator position pos and returns the following position  returned nothing before C++11  Removes all elements of the range [beg,end  and returns the following position  returned nothing before C++11  Removes all elements  empties the container   Table7.39. InsertandRemoveOperationsofSetsandMultisets  As usual when using the STL, you must ensure that the arguments are valid. Iterators must refer  to valid positions, and the beginning of a range must have a position that is not behind the end.  Inserting and removing is faster if, when working with multiple elements, you use a single call  for all elements rather than multiple calls.  For multisets, since C++11 it is guaranteed that insert  , emplace  , and erase   preserve the relative ordering of equivalent elements, and that inserted elements are placed at the end of existing equivalent values.  Note that the return types of the inserting functions insert   and emplace   differ as follows:   323  7.7 Sets and Multisets    Sets provide the following interface:10  pair  iterator  insert  const value_type& val ; insert  const_iterator posHint, const value_type& val ;  template   pair  emplace  Args&&... args ; template    iterator  emplace_hint  const_iterator posHint,  Args&&... args ;    Multisets provide the following interface:10  iterator iterator  iterator  iterator  insert  const value_type& val ; insert  const_iterator posHint, const value_type& val ;  template    template    emplace  Args&&... args ;  emplace_hint  const_iterator posHint,  Args&&... args ;  The difference in return types results because multisets allow duplicates, whereas sets do not. Thus, the insertion of an element might fail for a set if it already contains an element with the same value. Therefore, the return type for a set returns two values by using a pair structure  pair is discussed in Section 5.1.1, page 60 : 1. The member second of the pair structure returns whether the insertion was successful. 2. The member first of the pair structure returns the position of the newly inserted element or  the position of the still existing element.  In all other cases, the functions return the position of the new element or of the existing element if the set already contains an element with the same value.  The following example shows how to use this interface to insert a new element into a set. It tries  to insert the element with value 3.3 into the set c:  std::set  c; ... if  c.insert 3.3 .second  {  std::cout << "3.3 inserted" << std::endl;  } else {  }  std::cout << "3.3 already exists" << std::endl;  If you also want to process the new or old positions, the code gets more complicated:  10 Before C++11, only insert   was provided, and posHint had type iterator instead of const_iterator.   324  Chapter 7: STL Containers     insert value and process return value auto status = c.insert value ; if  status.second  {  std::cout << value << " inserted as element "  } else {  std::cout << value << " already exists as element "  } std::cout << std::distance c.begin  ,status.first  + 1 << std::endl;  The output of two calls of this sequence might be as follows:  8.9 inserted as element 4 7.7 already exists as element 3  In this example, the type of status is as follows:  std::pair ::iterator,bool>  Note that the return types of the insert functions with an additional position parameter don’t differ. These functions return a single iterator for both sets and multisets. However, these functions have the same effect as the functions without the position parameter. They differ only in their performance. You can pass an iterator position, but this position is processed as a hint to optimize performance. In fact, if the element gets inserted right after the position that is passed as the ﬁrst argument, the time complexity changes from logarithmic to amortized constant  complexity is discussed in Section 2.2, page 10 . The fact that the return type for the insert functions with the additional position hint doesn’t have the same difference as the insert functions without the position hint ensures that you have one insert function that has the same interface for all container types. In fact, this interface is used by general inserters. See Section 9.4.2, especially page 458, for details about inserters.  To remove an element that has a certain value, you simply call erase  : std::set  coll; ...    remove all elements with passed value coll.erase value ;  Note that this member function has a different name than remove   provided for lists  see Sec- tion 7.5.2, page 294, for a discussion of remove   . It behaves differently in that it returns the number of removed elements. When called for sets, it returns only 0 or 1.  If a multiset contains duplicates, you can’t use erase   to remove only the ﬁrst element of these  duplicates. Instead, you can code as follows:  std::multiset  coll; ...    remove ﬁrst element with passed value std::multiset ::iterator pos; pos = coll.find value ; if  pos != coll.end    {  coll.erase pos ;  }   7.7 Sets and Multisets  325  Because it is faster, you should use the member function find   instead of the find   algorithm here.  Note that before C++11, the erase   functions of associative containers returned nothing  had return type void . The reason was performance. It might cost time to ﬁnd and return the successor in an associative container, because the container is implemented as a binary tree. However, this greatly complicated code where you erase elements while iterating over them  see Section 7.8.2, page 342 .  Note also that for sets that use iterators as elements, calling erase   might be ambiguous now. For this reason, C++11 gets ﬁxed to provide overloads for both erase iterator  and erase const_iterator .  For multisets, all insert  , emplace  , and erase   operations preserve the relative order of equivalent elements. Since C++11, calling insert val  or emplace args...  guarantees that the new element is inserted at the end of the range of equivalent elements.  7.7.3 Exception Handling  Sets and multisets are node-based containers, so any failure to construct a node simply leaves the container as it was. Furthermore, because destructors in general don’t throw, removing a node can’t fail.  However, for multiple-element insert operations, the need to keep elements sorted makes full recovery from throws impractical. Thus, all single-element insert operations support commit-or- rollback behavior. That is, they either succeed or have no effect. In addition, it is guaranteed that all multiple-element delete operations always succeed or have no effect, provided that the comparison criterion does not throw. If copying assigning the comparison criterion may throw, swap   may throw.  See Section 6.12.2, page 248, for a general discussion of exception handling in the STL.  7.7.4 Examples of Using Sets and Multisets  The following program demonstrates some abilities of sets:     cont set1.cpp  include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {     type of the collection:    - no duplicates    - elements are integral values   326  Chapter 7: STL Containers     - descending order set > coll1;     insert elements in random order using different member functions coll1.insert {4,3,5,1,6,2} ; coll1.insert 5 ;  << distance coll1.begin  ,status.first  + 1 << endl;     print all elements for  int elem : coll1  { cout << elem << ’ ’;  } cout << endl;     insert 4 again and process return value auto status = coll1.insert 4 ; if  status.second  {  cout << "4 inserted as element "  } else {  }  cout << "4 already exists" << endl;     assign elements to another set with ascending order set  coll2 coll1.cbegin  ,coll1.cend   ;     print all elements of the copy using stream iterators copy  coll2.cbegin  , coll2.cend  ,  ostream_iterator  cout," "  ;  cout << endl;     remove all elements up to element with value 3 coll2.erase  coll2.begin  , coll2.find 3  ;     remove all elements with value 5 int num; num = coll2.erase  5 ; cout << num << " element s  removed" << endl;     print all elements copy  coll2.cbegin  , coll2.cend  ,  ostream_iterator  cout," "  ;  cout << endl;  }   7.7 Sets and Multisets  327  At ﬁrst, an empty set is created and several elements are inserted by using different overloads of insert  :  set > coll1;  coll1.insert {4,3,5,1,6,2} ; coll1.insert 5 ;  Note that the element with value 5 is inserted twice. However, the second insertion is ignored because sets do not allow duplicates.  After printing all elements, the program tries again to insert the element 4. This time, it processes  the return values of insert   as discussed in Section 7.7.2, page 323.  The statement set  coll2 coll1.cbegin  ,coll1.cend   ;  creates a new set of ints with ascending order and initializes it with the elements of the old set.  Both containers have different sorting criteria, so their types differ, and you can’t assign or com- pare them directly. However, you can use algorithms, which in general are able to handle different container types as long as the element types are equal or convertible.  The following statement removes all elements up to the element with value 3: coll2.erase  coll2.begin  , coll2.find 3  ;  Note that the element with value 3 is the end of the range, so it is not removed.  Finally, all elements with value 5 are removed: int num; num = coll2.erase  5 ; cout << num << " element s  removed" << endl;  The output of the whole program is as follows:  6 5 4 3 2 1 4 already exists 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 element s  removed 3 4 6  For multisets, the same program  provided in cont multiset1.cpp  looks a bit different and pro- duces different results. First, in all cases type set has to get replaced by multiset  the header ﬁle remains the same :  multiset > coll1; ... multiset  coll2 coll1.cbegin  ,coll1.cend   ;  In addition, the processing of the return value of insert   looks different. Sets allow no duplicates, so insert   returns both the new position of the inserted element and whether the insertion was successful:   328  Chapter 7: STL Containers  auto status = coll1.insert 4 ; if  status.second  {  cout << "4 inserted as element "  << distance coll1.begin  ,status.first  + 1 << endl;  } else {  }  cout << "4 already exists" << endl;  For multisets, insert   only returns the new position  because multisets may contain duplicates, the insertion can fail only if an exception gets thrown :  auto ipos = coll1.insert 4 ; cout << "4 inserted as element "  << distance coll1.begin  ,ipos  + 1 << endl;  The output of the program changes as follows:  6 5 4 3 2 1 4 already exists 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 element s  removed 3 4 6  7.7.5 Example of Specifying the Sorting Criterion at Runtime  Normally, you deﬁne the sorting criterion as part of the type, by either passing it as a second template argument or using the default sorting criterion less . Sometimes, however, you must process the sorting criterion at runtime, or you may need different sorting criteria with the same data type. In such cases, you need a special type for the sorting criterion: one that lets you pass your sorting details at runtime. The following example program demonstrates how to do this:11     cont setcmp1.cpp  include   include   include "print.hpp" using namespace std;     type for runtime sorting criterion class RuntimeCmp {  public:  enum cmp_mode {normal, reverse};  11 Thanks to Daniel Krugler for details of this example.  ¨   7.7 Sets and Multisets  329  private:  public:  cmp_mode mode;     constructor for sorting criterion    - default criterion uses value normal RuntimeCmp  cmp_mode m=normal  : mode m  { }    comparison of elements    - member function for any element type template   bool operator    const T& t1, const T& t2  const {  return mode==normal ? :  t1<t2 t2<t1;  }    comparison of sorting criteria bool operator==  const RuntimeCmp& rc  const {  return mode == rc.mode;     type of a set that uses this sorting criterion typedef set  IntSet;  }  };  int main   {     create, ﬁll, and print set with normal element order    - uses default sorting criterion IntSet coll1 = { 4, 7, 5, 1, 6, 2, 5 }; PRINT_ELEMENTS  coll1, "coll1: " ;     create sorting criterion with reverse element order RuntimeCmp reverse_order RuntimeCmp::reverse ;     create, ﬁll, and print set with reverse element order IntSet coll2 reverse_order ; coll2 = { 4, 7, 5, 1, 6, 2, 5 }; PRINT_ELEMENTS  coll2, "coll2: " ;     assign elements AND sorting criterion coll1 = coll2; coll1.insert 3 ; PRINT_ELEMENTS  coll1, "coll1: " ;   330  Chapter 7: STL Containers     just to make sure... if  coll1.value_comp   == coll2.value_comp    {  cout << "coll1 and coll2 have the same sorting criterion"  cout << "coll1 and coll2 have a different sorting criterion"  } else {  << endl;  << endl;  }  }  In this program, the class RuntimeCmp provides the general ability to specify, at runtime, the sort- ing criterion for any type. Its default constructor sorts in ascending order, using the default value normal. It also is possible to pass RuntimeCmp::reverse to sort in descending order.  The output of the program is as follows: coll1: 1 2 4 5 6 7 coll2: 7 6 5 4 2 1 coll1: 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 coll1 and coll2 have the same sorting criterion  Note that coll1 and coll2 have the same type, which is not the case when passing less  and greater  as sorting criteria. Note also that the assignment operator assigns the elements and the sorting criterion; otherwise, an assignment would be an easy way to compromise the sorting criterion.   7.8 Maps and Multimaps  331  7.8 Maps and Multimaps  Maps and multimaps are containers that manage key value pairs as elements. These containers sort their elements automatically, according to a certain sorting criterion that is used for the key. The difference between the two is that multimaps allow duplicates, whereas maps do not  Figure 7.14 .  Map:   Multimap:   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   1   1   2   3   3   3   4   Figure7.14. MapsandMultimaps  To use a map or a multimap, you must include the header ﬁle  : include    There, the types are deﬁned as class templates inside namespace std:  namespace std {  template <typename Key, typename T,  typename Compare = less , typename Allocator = allocator  > > class map;  template <typename Key, typename T,  typename Compare = less , typename Allocator = allocator  > > class multimap;  }  The ﬁrst template parameter is the type of the element’s key, and the second template parameter is the type of the element’s associated value. The elements of a map or a multimap may have any types Key and T that meet the following two requirements: 1. Both key and value must be copyable or movable. 2. The key must be comparable with the sorting criterion. Note that the element type  value_type  is a pair  . The optional third template parameter deﬁnes the sorting criterion. As for sets, this sorting criterion must deﬁne a “strict weak ordering”  see Section 7.7, page 314 . The elements are sorted according to their keys, so the value doesn’t matter for the order of the elements. The sorting criterion is also used to check for equivalence; that is, two elements are equal if neither key is less than the other.   332  Chapter 7: STL Containers  If a special sorting criterion is not passed, the default criterion less  is used. The function object less  sorts the elements by comparing them with operator <  see Section 10.2.1, page 487, for details about less .  For multimaps, the order of elements with equivalent keys is random but stable. Thus, insertions  and erasures preserve the relative ordering of equivalent elements  guaranteed since C++11 .  The optional fourth template parameter deﬁnes the memory model  see Chapter 19 . The default  memory model is the model allocator, which is provided by the C++ standard library.  7.8.1 Abilities of Maps and Multimaps  Like all standardized associative container classes, maps and multimaps are usually implemented as balanced binary trees  Figure 7.15 . The standard does not specify this, but it follows from the complexity of the map and multimap operations. In fact, sets, multisets, maps, and multimaps typically use the same internal data type. So, you could consider sets and multisets as special maps and multimaps, respectively, for which the value and the key of the elements are the same objects. Thus, maps and multimaps have all the abilities and operations of sets and multisets. Some minor differences exist, however. First, their elements are key value pairs. In addition, maps can be used as associative arrays.  7  y  4  y  9  x  2  y  5  q  8  y  11 w  1  x  3  z  6  y  10 q  12 z  Figure7.15. InternalStructureofMapsandMultimaps  Maps and multimaps sort their elements automatically, according to the element’s keys, and so have good performance when searching for elements that have a certain key. Searching for elements that have a certain value promotes bad performance. Automatic sorting imposes an important constraint on maps and multimaps: You may not change the key of an element directly, because doing so might compromise the correct order. To modify the key of an element, you must remove the element that has the old key and insert a new element that has the new key and the old value  see Section 7.8.2, page 339, for details . As a consequence, from the iterator’s point of view, the element’s key is constant. However, a direct modiﬁcation of the value of the element is still possible, provided that the type of the value is not constant.   7.8 Maps and Multimaps  333  7.8.2 Map and Multimap Operations  Create, Copy, and Destroy  Table 7.40 lists the constructors and destructors of maps and multimaps.

ConstructorsandDestructorsofMapsandMultimaps   334  Chapter 7: STL Containers  You can deﬁne the sorting criterion in two ways: 1. As a template parameter. For example:  std::map > coll;  In this case, the sorting criterion is part of the type. Thus, the type system ensures that only containers with the same sorting criterion can be combined. This is the usual way to specify the sorting criterion. To be more precise, the third parameter is the type of the sorting criterion. The concrete sorting criterion is the function object that gets created with the container. To do this, the constructor of the container calls the default constructor of the type of the sorting criterion. See Section 10.1.1, page 476, for an example that uses a user-deﬁned sorting criterion.  2. As a constructor parameter. In this case, you might have a type for several sorting criteria, and the initial value or state of the sorting criteria might differ. This is useful when processing the sorting criterion at runtime or when sorting criteria are needed that are different but of the same data type. A typical example is specifying the sorting criterion for string keys at runtime. See Section 7.8.6, for a complete example.  If no special sorting criterion is passed, the default sorting criterion, function object less , is used, which sorts the elements according to their key by using operator <. Again, the sorting criterion is also used to check for equivalence of two elements in the same container  i.e., to ﬁnd duplicates . Only to compare two containers is operator == required.  You might prefer a type deﬁnition to avoid the boring repetition of the type whenever it is used: typedef std::map >  StringFloatMap;  ... StringFloatMap coll;  The constructor for the beginning and the end of a range could be used to initialize the container with elements from containers that have other types, from arrays, or from the standard input. See Section 7.1.2, page 254, for details. However, the elements are key value pairs, so you must ensure that the elements from the source range have or are convertible into type pair .  Nonmodifying and Special Search Operations  Maps and multimaps provide the usual nonmodifying operations: those that query size aspects and make comparisons  Table 7.41 .  Comparisons are provided only for containers of the same type. Thus, the key, the value, and the sorting criterion must be of the same type. Otherwise, a type error occurs at compile time. For example:  std::map  c1; std::map  > c2; ... if  c1 == c2  {     ERROR: different types     sorting criterion: less   ...  }   7.8 Maps and Multimaps  335  Operation c.key_comp   c.value_comp   Returns the comparison criterion for values as a whole  an object that  Effect Returns the comparison criterion  c.empty    c.size   c.max_size   c1 == c2 c1 != c2 c1 < c2 c1 > c2 c1 <= c2 c1 >= c2  compares the key in a key value pair  Returns whether the container is empty  equivalent to size  ==0 but might be faster  Returns the current number of elements Returns the maximum number of elements possible Returns whether c1 is equal to c2  calls == for the elements  Returns whether c1 is not equal to c2  equivalent to ! c1==c2   Returns whether c1 is less than c2 Returns whether c1 is greater than c2  equivalent to c2<c1  Returns whether c1 is less than or equal to c2  equivalent to ! c2<c1   Returns whether c1 is greater than or equal to c2  equivalent to ! c1<c2    Table7.41. NonmodifyingOperationsofMapsandMultimaps  Checking whether a container is less than another container is done by a lexicographical comparison  see Section 11.5.4, page 548 . To compare containers of different types  different sorting criterion , you must use the comparing algorithms of Section 11.5.4, page 542.  Special Search Operations  As for sets and multisets, maps and multimaps provide special search member functions that perform better because of their internal tree structure  Table 7.42 .  Operation c.count val  c.find val   Effect Returns the number of elements with key val Returns the position of the ﬁrst element with key val  or end   if none found   c.lower_bound val  Returns the ﬁrst position where an element with key val would get  c.upper_bound val  Returns the last position where an element with key val would get  inserted  the ﬁrst element with a key >= val   inserted  the ﬁrst element with a key > val   c.equal_range val  Returns a range with all elements with a key equal to val  i.e., the ﬁrst and last positions, where an element with key val would get inserted   Table7.42. SpecialSearchOperationsofMapsandMultimaps  The find   member function searches for the ﬁrst element that has the appropriate key and returns its iterator position. If no such element is found, find   returns end   of the container. You can’t use the find   member function to search for an element that has a certain value. Instead, you have   336  Chapter 7: STL Containers  to use a general algorithm, such as the find_if   algorithm, or program an explicit loop. Here is an example of a simple loop that does something with each element that has a certain value:  std::multimap  coll; ...    do something with all elements having a certain value std::multimap ::iterator pos; for  pos = coll.begin  ; pos != coll.end  ; ++pos  {  if  pos->second == value  {  do_something  ;  }  }  Be careful when you want to use such a loop to remove elements. It might happen that you saw off the branch on which you are sitting. See Section 7.8.2, page 342, for details about this issue.  Using the find_if   algorithm to search for an element that has a certain value is even more complicated than writing a loop, because you have to provide a function object that compares the value of an element with a certain value. See Section 7.8.5, page 350, for an example.  The lower_bound  , upper_bound  , and equal_range   functions behave as they do for  sets  see Section 7.7.2, page 319 , except that the elements are key value pairs.  Assignments  As listed in Table 7.43, maps and multimaps provide only the fundamental assignment operations that all containers provide  see Section 7.1.2, page 258 .  Operation c = c2 c = rv  c = initlist  c1.swap c2  swap c1,c2   Effect Assigns all elements of c2 to c Move assigns all elements of the rvalue rv to c  since C++11  Assigns all elements of the initializer list initlist to c  since C++11  Swaps the data of c1 and c2 Swaps the data of c1 and c2  Table7.43. AssignmentOperationsofMapsandMultimaps  For these operations, both containers must have the same type. In particular, the type of the compar- ison criteria must be the same, although the comparison criteria themselves may be different. See Section 7.8.6, page 351, for an example of different sorting criteria that have the same type. If the criteria are different, they also get assigned or swapped.   7.8 Maps and Multimaps  337  Iterator Functions and Element Access  Maps and multimaps do not provide direct element access, so the usual way to access elements is via range-based for loops  see Section 3.1.4, page 17  or iterators. An exception to that rule is that maps provide at   and the subscript operator to access elements directly  see Section 7.8.3, page 343 . Table 7.44 lists the usual member functions for iterators that maps and multimaps provide.  Operation c.begin   c.end   c.cbegin    c.cend    c.rbegin   c.rend    Effect Returns a bidirectional iterator for the ﬁrst element Returns a bidirectional iterator for the position after the last element Returns a constant bidirectional iterator for the ﬁrst element  since C++11  Returns a constant bidirectional iterator for the position after the last element  since C++11  Returns a reverse iterator for the ﬁrst element of a reverse iteration Returns a reverse iterator for the position after the last element of a reverse iteration  c.crbegin   Returns a constant reverse iterator for the ﬁrst element of a reverse  c.crend    iteration  since C++11  Returns a constant reverse iterator for the position after the last element of a reverse iteration  since C++11   Table7.44. IteratorOperationsofMapsandMultimaps  As for all associative container classes, the iterators are bidirectional  see Section 9.2.4, page 437 . Thus, you can’t use them in algorithms that are provided only for random-access iterators, such as algorithms for sorting or random shufﬂing.  More important is the constraint that the key of all elements inside a map and a multimap is con- sidered to be constant. Thus, the type of the elements is pair . This is necessary to ensure that you can’t compromise the order of the elements by changing their keys. However, you can’t call any modifying algorithm if the destination is a map or a multimap. For example, you can’t call the remove   algorithm, because it “removes” by overwriting “removed” elements with the fol- lowing elements  see Section 6.7.2, page 221, for a detailed discussion of this problem . To remove elements in maps and multimaps, you can use only member functions provided by the container.  The following is an example of element access via use range-based for loops: std::map  coll; ... for  auto elem& : coll  {  std::cout << "key: "  << elem.first  << "\t"  << "value: " << elem.second << std::endl;  }  Inside the loop, elem becomes a reference referring to the actual element of the container coll currently processed. Thus. elem has type pair . The expression   Chapter 7: STL Containers  338  }  elem.first yields the key of the actual element, whereas the expression elem.second yields the value of the actual element.  The corresponding code using iterators, which has to be used before C++11, looks as follows: std::map  coll; ... std::map ::iterator pos; for  pos = coll.begin  ; pos != coll.end  ; ++pos  {  std::cout << "key: "   first  << "\t"   second << std::endl;  Here, the iterator pos iterates through the sequence of pairs of const string and float, and you have to use operator -> to access key and value of the actual element.12  Trying to change the value of the key results in an error: elem.first = "hello"; pos->first = "hello";     ERROR at compile time    ERROR at compile time  However, changing the value of the element is no problem, as long as elem is declared as a noncon- stant reference and the type of the value is not constant:  elem.second = 13.5; pos->second = 13.5;     OK    OK  If you use algorithms and lambdas to operate with the elements of a map, you explicitly have to declare the element type:  std::map  coll; ...    add 10 to the value of each element: std::for_each  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  []  std::pair & elem  {  elem.second += 10;  } ;  Instead of using the following:  std::pair   you could use  or  std::map ::value_type  decltype coll ::value_type  to declare the type of an element. See Section 7.8.5, page 345, for a complete example.  To change the key of an element, you have only one choice: You must replace the old element  with a new element that has the same value. Here is a generic function that does this:  12 pos->first is a shortcut for  *pos .first.   7.8 Maps and Multimaps  339     cont newkey.hpp  namespace MyLib {  template   inline bool replace_key  Cont& c,  const typename Cont::key_type& old_key, const typename Cont::key_type& new_key   {  typename Cont::iterator pos; pos = c.find old_key ; if  pos != c.end    {     insert new element with value of old element c.insert typename Cont::value_type new_key,  pos->second  ;     remove old element c.erase pos ; return true;  } else {     key not found return false;  }  }  }  example:  The insert   and erase   member functions are discussed in the next subsection.  To use this generic function, you simply pass the container, the old key, and the new key. For  std::map  coll; ... MyLib::replace_key coll,"old key","new key" ;  It works the same way for multimaps.  Note that maps provide a more convenient way to modify the key of an element. Instead of  calling replace_key  , you can simply write the following:     insert new element with value of old element coll["new_key"] = coll["old_key"];    remove old element coll.erase "old_key" ;  See Section 7.8.3, page 343, for details about the use of the subscript operator with maps.   340  Chapter 7: STL Containers  Inserting and Removing Elements  Operation c.insert val   c.insert pos,val   c.insert beg,end   c.insert initlist   c.emplace args...   c.erase val   c.erase pos   c.erase beg,end   c.clear    c.emplace_hint pos,args...

InsertandRemoveOperationsofMapsandMultimaps  Table 7.45 shows the operations provided for maps and multimaps to insert and remove elements. The remarks in Section 7.7.2, page 322, regarding sets and multisets apply here. In particular, the return types of these operations have the same differences as they do for sets and multisets. However, note that the elements here are key value pairs. So, the use is getting a bit more complicated.  For multimaps, since C++11 it is guaranteed that insert  , emplace  , and erase   preserve the relative ordering of equivalent elements, and that inserted elements are placed at the end of existing equivalent values.  To insert a key value pair, you must keep in mind that inside maps and multimaps, the key is considered to be constant. You must provide either the correct type or you need to provide implicit or explicit type conversions.  Since C++11, the most convenient way to insert elements is to pass them as an initializer list,  where the ﬁrst entry is the key and the second entry is the value:  std::map  coll; ... coll.insert {"otto",22.3} ;   7.8 Maps and Multimaps  341  Alternatively, there are three other ways to pass a value into a map or a multimap: 1. Use value_type. To avoid implicit type conversion, you could pass the correct type explic- itly by using value_type, which is provided as a type deﬁnition by the container type. For example:  std::map  coll; ... coll.insert std::map ::value_type "otto", 22.3  ;  or  coll.insert decltype coll ::value_type "otto",22.3  ;  2. Use pair . Another way is to use pair  directly. For example:  std::map  coll; ...    use implicit conversion: coll.insert std::pair  "otto",22.3  ;    use no implicit conversion: coll.insert std::pair  "otto",22.3  ;  In the ﬁrst insert   statement, the type is not quite right, so it is converted into the real element type. For this to happen, the insert   member function is deﬁned as a member template  see Section 3.2, page 34 .  3. Use make_pair  . Probably the most convenient way before C++11 was to use make_pair  , which produces a pair object that contains the two values passed as arguments  see Section 5.1.1, page 65 :  std::map  coll; ... coll.insert std::make_pair "otto",22.3  ;  Again, the necessary type conversions are performed by the insert   member template.  Here is a simple example of the insertion of an element into a map that also checks whether the insertion was successful:  std::map  coll; ... if  coll.insert std::make_pair "otto",22.3  .second  {  std::cout << "OK, could insert otto 22.3" << std::endl;  } else {  }  std::cout << "OOPS, could not insert otto 22.3 "  << " key otto already exists " << std::endl;  See Section 7.7.2, page 322, for a discussion about the return values of the insert   functions and more examples that also apply to maps. Note, again, that maps provide operator [ ] and at   as another convenient way to insert  and set  elements with the subscript operator  see Section 7.8.3, page 343 .   342  Chapter 7: STL Containers  When using emplace   to insert a new element by passing the values for its construction, you have to pass two lists of arguments: one for the key and one for the element. The most convenient way to do this is as follows:  std::map > m;  m.emplace std::piecewise_construct, std::make_tuple "hello" , std::make_tuple 3.4,7.8  ;     pass tuple elements as arguments    elements for the key    elements for the value  See Section 5.1.1, page 63, for details of piecewise construction of pairs.  To remove an element that has a certain value, you simply call erase  : std::map  coll; ...    remove all elements with the passed key coll.erase key ;  This version of erase   returns the number of removed elements. When called for maps, the return value of erase   can only be 0 or 1.  If a multimap contains duplicates and you want to remove only the ﬁrst element of these dupli-  cates, you can’t use erase  . Instead, you could code as follows:  std::multimap  coll; ...    remove ﬁrst element with passed key auto pos = coll.find key ; if  pos != coll.end    {  coll.erase pos ;  }  You should use the member function find   instead of the find   algorithm here because it is faster  see an example with the find   algorithm in Section 7.3.2, page 277 . However, you can’t use the find   member functions to remove elements that have a certain value instead of a certain key. See Section 7.8.2, page 335, for a detailed discussion of this topic.  When removing elements, be careful not to saw off the branch on which you are sitting. There is  a big danger that you will remove an element to which your iterator is referring. For example:  std::map  coll; ... for  auto pos = coll.begin  ; pos != coll.end  ; ++pos  {  if  pos->second == value  {  coll.erase pos ;     RUNTIME ERROR !!!  }  }  Calling erase   for the element to which you are referring with pos invalidates pos as an iterator of coll. Thus, if you use pos after removing its element without any reinitialization, all bets are off. In fact, calling ++pos results in undeﬁned behavior.   7.8 Maps and Multimaps  343  Since C++11, a solution is easy because erase   always returns the value of the following  element:  std::map  coll; ... for  auto pos = coll.begin  ; pos != coll.end  ;   {  if  pos->second == value  {  pos = coll.erase pos ;     possible only since C++11  Unfortunately, before C++11, it was a design decision not to return the following position, because if not needed, it costs unnecessary time. However, this made programming tasks like this error prone and complicated and even more costly in terms of time. Here is an example of the correct way to remove elements to which an iterator refers before C++11:  typedef std::map  StringFloatMap; StringFloatMap coll; StringFloatMap::iterator pos; ...    remove all elements having a certain value for  pos = coll.begin  ; pos != coll.end  ;   {  if  pos->second == value  {  coll.erase pos++ ;  } else {  ++pos;  }  }  } else {  ++pos;  }  }  Note that pos++ increments pos so that it refers to the next element but yields a copy of its original value. Thus, pos doesn’t refer to the element that is removed when erase   is called.  Note also that for sets that use iterators as elements, calling erase   might be ambiguous now. For this reason, C++11 gets ﬁxed to provide overloads for both erase iterator  and erase const_iterator .  For multimaps, all insert  , emplace  , and erase   operations preserve the relative order of equivalent elements. Since C++11, calling insert val  or emplace args...  guarantees that the new element is inserted at the end of the range of equivalent elements.  7.8.3 Using Maps as Associative Arrays  Associative containers don’t typically provide abilities for direct element access. Instead, you must use iterators. For maps, as well as for unordered maps  see Section 7.9, page 355 , however, there   344  Chapter 7: STL Containers  is an exception to this rule. Nonconstant maps provide a subscript operator for direct element ac- cess. In addition, since C++11, a corresponding member function at   is provided for constant and nonconstant maps  see Table 7.46 .  Operation Effect c[key]  Inserts an element with key, if it does not yet exist, and returns a reference to the value of the element with key  only for nonconstant maps   c.at key  Returns a reference to the value of the element with key  since C++11   Table7.46. DirectElementAccessofMaps  at   yields the value of the element with the passed key and throws an exception object of type  out_of_range if no such element is present.  For operator [ ], the index also is the key that is used to identify the element. This means that for operator [ ], the index may have any type rather than only an integral type. Such an interface is the interface of a so-called associative array.  For operator [ ], the type of the index is not the only difference from ordinary arrays. In addition, you can’t have a wrong index. If you use a key as the index for which no element yet exists, a new element gets inserted into the map automatically. The value of the new element is initialized by the default constructor of its type. Thus, to use this feature, you can’t use a value type that has no default constructor. Note that the fundamental data types provide a default constructor that initializes their values to zero  see Section 3.2.1, page 37 . This behavior of an associative array has both advantages and disadvantages:   The advantage is that you can insert new elements into a map with a more convenient interface.  For example:  std::map  coll;     empty collection     insert "otto" 7.7 as key value pair    - ﬁrst it inserts "otto" float      - then it assigns 7.7 coll["otto"] = 7.7;  The statement  coll["otto"] = 7.7; is processed here as follows: 1. Process coll["otto"] expression:  reference.  – If an element with key "otto" exists, the expression returns the value of the element by  – If, as in this example, no element with key "otto" exists, the expression inserts a new element automatically, with "otto" as key and the value of the default constructor of the value type as the element value. It then returns a reference to that new value of the new element.  2. Assign value 7.7:  – The second part of the statement assigns 7.7 to the value of the new or existing element.  The map then contains an element with key "otto" and value 7.7.   7.8 Maps and Multimaps  345    The disadvantage is that you might insert new elements by accident or mistake. For example, the  following statement does something you probably hadn’t intended or expected:  std::cout << coll["ottto"];  It inserts a new element with key "ottto" and prints its value, which is 0 by default. However, it should have generated an error message telling you that you wrote "otto" incorrectly.  Note, too, that this way of inserting elements is slower than the usual way for maps, which is described in Section 7.8.2, page 340. The reason is that the new value is ﬁrst initialized by the default value of its type, which is then overwritten by the correct value.  See Section 6.2.4, page 185, and Section 7.8.5, page 346, for some example code.  7.8.4 Exception Handling  Maps and multimaps provide the same behavior as sets and multisets with respect to exception safety. This behavior is mentioned in Section 7.7.3, page 325.  7.8.5 Examples of Using Maps and Multimaps  Using Algorithms and Lambdas with a Map Multimap  Section 6.2.3, page 183, introduced an example for an unordered multimap, which could also be used with an ordinary  sorting  map or multimap. Here is a corresponding example using a map. This program also demonstrates how to use algorithms and lambdas instead of range-based for loops:     cont map1.cpp  include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {  map  coll { { "tim", 9.9 },  { "struppi", 11.77 }  } ;     square the value of each element: for_each  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  []  pair & elem  {  elem.second *= elem.second;  } ;   346  Chapter 7: STL Containers     print each element: for_each  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  []  const map ::value_type& elem  {  cout << elem.first << ": " << elem.second << endl;  } ;  }  As you can see, for a map, for_each   is called twice: once to square each element and once to print each element. In the ﬁrst call, the type of an element is declared explicitly; in the second call, value_type is used. In the ﬁrst call, the element is passed by reference to be able to modify its value; in the second call, a constant reference is used to avoid unnecessary copies.  The following example shows the use of a map as an associative array. The map is used as a stock chart. The elements of the map are pairs in which the key is the name of the stock and the value is its price:  The program has the following output: struppi: 138.533 tim: 98.01  Using a Map as an Associative Array     cont map2.cpp  include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {     create map   associative array    - keys are strings    - values are floats typedef map  StringFloatMap;  StringFloatMap stocks;     create empty container     insert some elements stocks["BASF"] = 369.50; stocks["VW"] = 413.50; stocks["Daimler"] = 819.00; stocks["BMW"] = 834.00; stocks["Siemens"] = 842.20;   7.8 Maps and Multimaps  347     print all elements StringFloatMap::iterator pos;    left-adjust values cout << left; for  pos = stocks.begin  ; pos != stocks.end  ; ++pos  {  cout  first   second << endl;  } cout << endl;     boom  all prices doubled  for  pos = stocks.begin  ; pos != stocks.end  ; ++pos  {  pos->second *= 2;  }     print all elements for  pos = stocks.begin  ; pos != stocks.end  ; ++pos  {  cout  first   second << endl;  } cout << endl;     rename key from "VW" to "Volkswagen"    - provided only by exchanging element stocks["Volkswagen"] = stocks["VW"]; stocks.erase "VW" ;     print all elements for  pos = stocks.begin  ; pos != stocks.end  ; ++pos  {  cout  first   second << endl;  }  }  The program has the following output:  stock: BASF stock: BMW stock: Daimler stock: Siemens stock: VW  price: 369.5 price: 834 price: 819 price: 842.2 price: 413.5  stock: BASF stock: BMW stock: Daimler  price: 739 price: 1668 price: 1638   348  Chapter 7: STL Containers  stock: Siemens stock: VW  price: 1684.4 price: 827  stock: BASF stock: BMW stock: Daimler stock: Siemens stock: Volkswagen  price: 739 price: 1668 price: 1638 price: 1684.4 price: 827  Using a Multimap as a Dictionary  The following example shows how to use a multimap as a dictionary:     cont multimap1.cpp  include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {     create multimap as string string dictionary multimap  dict;     insert some elements in random order dict.insert   { {"day","Tag"}, {"strange","fremd"},  {"car","Auto"}, {"smart","elegant"}, {"trait","Merkmal"}, {"strange","seltsam"}, {"smart","raffiniert"}, {"smart","klug"}, {"clever","raffiniert"} }  ;     print all elements cout.setf  ios::left, ios::adjustfield ; cout << ’ ’ << setw 10  << "english "  << "german " << endl;  cout << setfill ’-’  << setw 20  << ""  << setfill ’ ’  << endl;  for   const auto& elem : dict   {  cout << ’ ’ << setw 10  << elem.first  << elem.second << endl;  } cout << endl;   7.8 Maps and Multimaps  349     print all values for key "smart" string word "smart" ; cout << word << ": " << endl; for  auto pos = dict.lower_bound word ;  pos != dict.upper_bound word ; ++pos  {  cout << "  "  second << endl;  }     print all keys for value "raffiniert" word =  "raffiniert" ; cout << word << ": " << endl; for  const auto& elem : dict  {  if  elem.second == word  {  cout << "  " << elem.first << endl;  The program has the following output:  english  german  --------------------  }  }  }  car clever day smart smart smart strange strange trait  smart:  elegant raffiniert klug  raffiniert: clever smart  Auto raffiniert Tag elegant raffiniert klug fremd seltsam Merkmal  See a corresponding example that uses an unordered multimap as a dictionary in Section 7.9.7, page 383.   350  Chapter 7: STL Containers  Finding Elements with Certain Values  The following example shows how to use the global find_if   algorithm to ﬁnd an element with a certain value  in contrast to ﬁnding a key with a certain value :     cont mapfind1.cpp  include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {     map with floats as key and value    - initializing keys and values are automatically converted to float map  coll = { {1,7}, {2,4}, {3,2}, {4,3},  {5,6}, {6,1}, {7,3} };     search an element with key 3.0  logarithmic complexity  auto posKey = coll.find 3.0 ; if  posKey != coll.end    {  cout << "key 3.0 found  "   first << ":"  second << " " << endl;  }     search an element with value 3.0  linear complexity  auto posVal = find_if coll.begin  ,coll.end  ,  if  posVal != coll.end    {  cout << "value 3.0 found  "  } ;   first << ":"  second << " " << endl;  []  const pair & elem  {  return elem.second == 3.0;  }  }  The output of the program is as follows:  key 3.0 found  3:2  value 3.0 found  4:3    7.8 Maps and Multimaps  351  7.8.6 Example with Maps, Strings, and Sorting Criterion  at Runtime  The example here is for advanced programmers rather than STL beginners. You can take it as an example of both the power and the problems of the STL. In particular, this example demonstrates the following techniques:   How to use maps, including the associative array interface   How to write and use function objects   How to deﬁne a sorting criterion at runtime   How to compare strings in a case-insensitive way     cont mapcmp1.cpp  include   include   include   include   include   include   using namespace std;     function object to compare strings    - allows you to set the comparison criterion at runtime    - allows you to compare case insensitive class RuntimeStringCmp {  public:     constants for the comparison criterion enum cmp_mode {normal, nocase};  private:     actual comparison mode const cmp_mode mode;     auxiliary function to compare case insensitive static bool nocase_compare  char c1, char c2  {  return toupper c1  < toupper c2 ;  }  public:     constructor: initializes the comparison criterion RuntimeStringCmp  cmp_mode m=normal  : mode m  { }     the comparison bool operator    const string& s1, const string& s2  const {   352  Chapter 7: STL Containers  if  mode == normal  {  return s1<s2;  } else {  return lexicographical_compare  s1.begin  , s1.end  , s2.begin  , s2.end  , nocase_compare ;  }  }  };     container type:    - map with          typedef map  StringStringMap;  - string keys - string values - the special comparison object type     function that ﬁlls and prints such containers void fillAndPrint StringStringMap& coll ;  int main   {     create a container with the default comparison criterion StringStringMap coll1; fillAndPrint coll1 ;     create an object for case-insensitive comparisons RuntimeStringCmp ignorecase RuntimeStringCmp::nocase ;     create a container with the case-insensitive comparisons criterion StringStringMap coll2 ignorecase ; fillAndPrint coll2 ;  }  void fillAndPrint StringStringMap& coll  {     insert elements in random order coll["Deutschland"] = "Germany"; coll["deutsch"] = "German"; coll["Haken"] = "snag"; coll["arbeiten"] = "work"; coll["Hund"] = "dog";   7.8 Maps and Multimaps  353  coll["gehen"] = "go"; coll["Unternehmen"] = "enterprise"; coll["unternehmen"] = "undertake"; coll["gehen"] = "walk"; coll["Bestatter"] = "undertaker";     print elements cout.setf ios::left, ios::adjustfield ; for  const auto& elem : coll  {  cout << setw 15  << elem.first << " "  << elem.second << endl;  } cout << endl;  }  In the program, main   creates two containers and calls fillAndPrint   for them, which ﬁlls these containers with the same elements and prints their contents. However, the containers have two different sorting criteria: 1. coll1 uses the default function object of type RuntimeStringCmp, which compares the ele-  ments by using operator <.  2. coll2 uses a function object of type RuntimeStringCmp, which is initialized by value nocase of class RuntimeStringCmp. nocase forces this function object to sort strings in a case- insensitive way.  The program has the following output: undertaker Germany snag dog enterprise work German walk undertake  Bestatter Deutschland Haken Hund Unternehmen arbeiten deutsch gehen unternehmen  arbeiten Bestatter deutsch Deutschland gehen Haken Hund Unternehmen  work undertaker German Germany walk snag dog undertake   354  Chapter 7: STL Containers  The ﬁrst block of the output prints the contents of the ﬁrst container that compares with operator <. The output starts with all uppercase keys, followed by all lowercase keys.  The second block prints all case-insensitive items, so the order changed. But note that the second block has one item less because the uppercase word “Unternehmen” is, from a case-insensitive point of view, equal to the lowercase word “unternehmen,”13 and we use a map that does not allow duplicates according to its comparison criterion. Unfortunately the result is a mess because the German key, initialized by is the translation for “enterprise,” got the value “undertake.” So a multimap should probably be used here. Doing so makes sense because a multimap is the typical container for dictionaries.  13 In German, all nouns are written with an initial capital letter, whereas all verbs are written in lowercase letters.   7.9 Unordered Containers  355  7.9 Unordered Containers  The hash table, one important data structure for collections, was not part of the ﬁrst version of the C++ standard library. They were not part of the original STL and the committee decided that the proposal for their inclusion in C++98 came too late.  At some point you have to stop introducing features and focus on the details. Otherwise, you never ﬁnish the work.  However, with TR1, containers with the characteristics of hash tables ﬁnally came into the standard.  Nevertheless, even before TR1, several implementations of hash tables were available in the C++ community. Libraries typically provided four kinds of hash tables: hash_set, hash_multiset, hash_map, and hash_multimap. However, those hash tables have been implemented slightly differ- ently. With TR1, a consolidated group of hash table-based containers was introduced. The features provided for the standardized classes combined existing implementations and didn’t match any of them completely. To avoid name clashes, therefore, different class names were chosen. The decision was to provide all the existing associative containers with the preﬁx unordered_. This also demon- strates the most important difference between ordinary and the new associative containers: With the hash table-based implementations, the elements have no deﬁned order. See [N1456:HashTable] for details about the design decisions for all the unordered containers.  Strictly speaking, the C++ standard library calls unordered containers “unordered associative containers.” However, I will just use “unordered containers” when I refer to them. With “associative containers,” I still refer to the “old” associative containers, which are provided since C++98 and implemented as binary trees  set, multiset, map, and multimap .  Unordered Set Multiset:   Unordered Map Multimap:   Figure7.16. UnorderedContainers  Conceptionally, unordered containers contain all the elements you insert in an arbitrary order  see Figure 7.16 . That is, you can consider the container to be a bag: you can put in elements, but when you open the bag to do something with all the elements, you access them in a random order. So, in contrast with  multi sets and  multi maps, there is no sorting criterion; in contrast with sequence containers, you have no semantics to put an element into a speciﬁc position.   Unordered sets and multisets store single values of a speciﬁc type, whereas in unordered maps and multimaps, the elements are key value pairs, where the key is used to store and ﬁnd a speciﬁc element, including its associated value.   Unordered sets and maps allow no duplicates, whereas unordered multisets and multimaps do.  As with associative containers, the individual classes differ as follows:   356  Chapter 7: STL Containers  To use an unordered set or multiset, you must include the header ﬁle  . To use an unordered map or multimap, you must include the header ﬁle  :  There, the types are deﬁned as class templates inside namespace std:  include   include    namespace std {  template <typename T,  typename Hash = hash , typename EqPred = equal_to , typename Allocator = allocator  > class unordered_set;  template <typename T,  typename Hash = hash , typename EqPred = equal_to , typename Allocator = allocator  > class unordered_multiset;  template <typename Key, typename T,  typename Hash = hash , typename EqPred = equal_to , typename Allocator = allocator  > > class unordered_map;  template <typename Key, typename T,  typename Hash = hash , typename EqPred = equal_to , typename Allocator = allocator  > > class unordered_multimap;  }  The elements of an unordered set or multiset may have any type T that is comparable.  For unordered maps and multimaps, the ﬁrst template parameter is the type of the element’s key, and the second template parameter is the type of the element’s associated value. The elements of an unordered map or an unordered multimap may have any types Key and T that meet the following two requirements: 1. Both key and value must be copyable or movable. 2. The key must be comparable with the equivalence criterion. Note that the element type  value_type  is a pair .  The optional second third template parameter deﬁnes the hash function. If a special hash function is not passed, the default hash function hash  is used, which is provided as a function object in   for all integral types, all ﬂoating-point types, pointers, strings, and some special   7.9 Unordered Containers  357  types.14 For all other value types, you must pass your own hash function, which is explained in Section 7.9.2, page 363, and Section 7.9.7, page 377.  The optional third fourth template parameter deﬁnes an equivalence criterion: a predicate that is used to ﬁnd elements. It should return whether two values are equal. If a special compare criterion is not passed, the default criterion equal_to  is used, which compares the elements by comparing them with operator ==  see Section 10.2.1, page 487, for details about equal_to  .  The optional fourth ﬁfth template parameter deﬁnes the memory model  see Chapter 19 . The  default memory model is the model allocator, which is provided by the C++ standard library.  7.9.1 Abilities of Unordered Containers  All standardized unordered container classes are implemented as hash tables, which nonetheless still have a variety of implementation options. As usual, the C++ standard library does not spec- ify all these implementation details to allow a variety of possible implementation options, but a few of the speciﬁed abilities of unordered containers are based on the following assumptions  see [N1456:HashTable] :   The hash tables use the “chaining” approach, whereby a hash code is associated with a linked list.  This technique, also called “open hashing” or “closed addressing,” should not be confused with “open addressing” or “closed hashing.”    Whether these linked lists are singly or doubly linked is open to the implementers. For this   Various implementation strategies are possible for rehashing:  reason, the standard guarantees only that the iterators are “at least” forward iterators.  – With the traditional approach, a complete reorganization of the internal data happens from  time to time as a result of a single insert or erase operation.  – With incremental hashing, a resizing of the number of bucket or slots is performed gradually, which is especially useful in real-time environments, where the price of enlarging a hash table all at once can be too high.  Unordered containers allow both strategies and give no guarantee that conﬂicts with either of them.  Figure 7.17 shows the typical internal layout of an unordered set or multiset according to the minimal guarantees given by the C++ standard library. For each value to store, the hash function maps it to a bucket  slot  in the hash table. Each bucket manages a singly linked list containing all the elements for which the hash function yields the same value.  Figure 7.18 shows the typical internal layout of an unordered map or multimap according to the minimal guarantees given by the C++ standard library. For each element to store, which is a key value pair, the hash function maps the value of the key to a bucket  slot  in the hash table. Each bucket manages a singly linked list containing all the elements for which the hash function yields the same value.  The major advantage of using a hash table internally is its incredible running-time behavior. Assuming that the hashing strategy is well chosen and well implemented, you can guarantee amor-  14 error_code, thread::id, bitset , and vector    358  Chapter 7: STL Containers  Figure7.17. InternalStructureofUnorderedSetsandMultisets  hashfunc     hashfunc     Figure7.18. InternalStructureofUnorderedMapsandMultimaps  tized constant time for insertions, deletions, and element search  “amortized” because the occasional rehashing happens that occurs can be a large operation with a linear complexity .  The expected behavior of nearly all the operations on unordered containers, including copy con- struction and assignment, element insertion and lookup, and equivalence comparison, depends on the quality of the hash function. If the hash function generates equal values for different elements,   7.9 Unordered Containers  359  Unordered containers also have some disadvantages over ordinary associative containers:  which also happens if an unordered container that allows duplicates is populated with equivalent values or keys, any hash table operation results in poor runtime performance. This is a fault not so much of the data structure itself but rather of its use by unenlightened clients.   Unordered containers don’t provide operators  ,  = to order multiple instances of   lower_bound   and upper_bound   are not provided.   Because the iterators are guaranteed only to be forward iterators, reverse iterators, including rbegin  , rend  , crbegin  , and crend  , are not supported, and you can’t use algorithms that require bidirectional iterators, or at least this is not portable.  these containers. However, == and != are provided  since C++11 .  Because the  key  value of an element speciﬁes its position — in this case, its bucket entry — you are not allowed to modify the  key  value of an element directly. Therefore, much as with associative containers, to modify the value of an element, you must remove the element that has the old value and insert a new element that has the new value. The interface reﬂects this behavior:   Unordered containers don’t provide operations for direct element access.   Indirect access via iterators has the constraint that, from the iterator’s point of view, the element’s   key  value is constant.  to ﬁnd the right element among all entries in the bucket lists.  As a programmer, you can specify parameters that inﬂuence the behavior of the hash table:   You can specify the minimum number of buckets.   You can  and sometimes have to  provide your own hash function.   You can  and sometimes have to  provide your own equivalence criterion: a predicate that is used   You can specify a maximum load factor, which leads to automatic rehashing when it is exceeded.   You can force rehashing. But you can’t inﬂuence the following behavior:   The growth factor, which is the factor automatic rehashing uses to grow or shrink the list of   The minimum load factor, which is used to force rehashing when the number of elements in the  buckets  container shrinks  Note that rehashing is possible only after a call to insert  , rehash  , reserve  , or clear  . This is a consequence of the guarantee that erase   never invalidates iterators, references, and pointers to the elements. Thus, if you delete hundreds of elements, the bucket size will not change. But if you insert one element afterward, the bucket size might shrink.  Also note that in containers that support equivalent keys — unordered multisets and multimaps — elements with equivalent keys are adjacent to each other when iterating over the elements of the container. Rehashing and other operations that internally change the order of elements preserve the relative order of elements with equivalent keys.  7.9.2 Creating and Controlling Unordered Containers  Hash tables are pretty complicated data structures. For this reason, you have a lot of abilities to deﬁne or query their behavior.   360  Chapter 7: STL Containers  Table 7.47 lists the constructors and destructors of unordered associative containers. Table 7.48 lists the types Unord that can be used with these constructors and destructors.

PossibleTypesUnord ofUnorderedContainers  For the construction, you have multiple abilities to pass arguments. On one hand, you can pass values as initial elements:   An existing container of the same type  copy constructor    All elements of a range [begin,end    All elements of an initializer list On the other hand, you can pass arguments that inﬂuence the behavior of the unordered container:   The hash function  either as template or as constructor argument    The equivalence criterion  either as template or as constructor argument    The initial number of buckets  as constructor argument    362  Chapter 7: STL Containers  Note that you can’t specify the maximum load factor as part of the type or via a constructor argument, although this is something you might often want to set initially. To specify the maximum load factor, you have to call a member function right after construction  see Table 7.49 :  std::unordered_set  coll; coll.max_load_factor 0.7 ;  The argument for max_load_factor   has to be a float. In general, a value between 0.7 and 0.8 provides a good compromise between speed and memory consumption. Note that the default maximum load factor is 1.0, which means that, usually, collisions apply before rehash happens. For this reason, if speed is an issue, you should always explicitly set the maximum load factor.  Layout Operations  Unordered containers also provide operations to query and inﬂuence the internal layout. Table 7.49 lists these operations.  Operation c.hash_function   c.key_eq   c.bucket_count   c.max_bucket_count   c.load_factor   c.max_load_factor   c.max_load_factor val  c.rehash bnum   c.reserve num   Effect Returns the hash function Returns the equivalence predicate Returns the current number of buckets Returns the maximum number of buckets possible Returns the current load factor Returns the current maximum load factor Sets the maximum load factor to val Rehashes the container so that it has a bucket size of at least bnum Rehashes the container so that is has space for at least num elements  since C++11   Table7.49. LayoutOperationsofUnorderedContainers  Besides max_load_factor  , the member functions rehash   and reserve   are important. They provide the functionality to rehash an unordered container  i.e., change the number of buckets  with a slightly different interface: Originally, with TR1, only rehash   was provided, which is a request to provide a hash table with a bucket size of at least the size passed. The problem was that with this interface, you still had to take the maximum load factor into account. If the maximum load factor is 0.7 and you want to be prepared for 100 elements, you have to divide 100 by 0.7 to compute the size that does not cause rehashing as long as no more than 100 elements have been inserted. That is, you have to pass 143 to rehash   to avoid further rehashing for up to 100 elements. With reserve  , this computing is done internally, so you can simply pass the number of elements the hash table should be prepared for:  coll.rehash 100 ; coll.reserve 100 ;     prepare for 100 max_load_factor   elements    prepare for 100 elements  since C++11    7.9 Unordered Containers  363  With bucket_count  , you can query the number of buckets an unordered container currently has. This value can be used for a number of member functions that provide a “bucket interface” you can use to inspect the exact internal state of an unordered container. See Section 7.9.4, page 374, for more details about and Section 7.9.7, page 380, for an example of inspecting the internal layout of an unordered container with the bucket interface.  Providing Your Own Hash Function  All hash tables use a hash function, which maps the values of the elements that you put into the container to a speciﬁc bucket. The goal is that two equal values always yield the same bucket index, whereas for different values, different bucket entries ideally should be processed. For any range of passed values, the hash function should provide a good distribution of hash values.  The hash function has to be a function or a function object that takes a value of the element type as parameter and returns a value of type std::size_t. Thus, the current number of buckets is not taken into account. Mapping the return value to the range of valid bucket indexes is done internally in the container. Thus, your goal is to provide a function that maps the different element values equally distributed in the range [0,size_t .  Here is an example of how to provide your own hash function: include    class Customer {  ...  };  class CustomerHash {  public:  return ...  }  };  std::size_t operator    const Customer& c  const {  std::unordered_set  custset;  Here, CustomerHash is a function object that deﬁnes the hash function for class Customer.  Instead of passing a function object to the type of the container, you can also pass a hash function as construction argument. Note, however, that the template type for the hash function must be set accordingly:  std::size_t customer_hash_func  const Customer& c  {  return ...  };  std::unordered_set   custset 20,customer_hash_func ;   364  Chapter 7: STL Containers  Here, customer_hash_func   is passed as second constructor argument with its type “pointer to a function taking a Customer and returning a std::size_t” passed as second template argument. If a special hash function is not passed, the default hash function hash  is used, which is provided as a function object in   for “common” types: all integral types, all ﬂoating- point types, pointers, strings, and some special types.15 For all other types, you have to provide your own hash function.  Providing a good hash function is trickier than it sounds. As a rule of thumb, you might use the default hash functions to specify your own hash functions. A naive approach would be to simply add all hash values for those attributes that are relevant for the hash function. For example:  class CustomerHash {  public:  }  };  std::size_t operator    const Customer& c  const {  return std::hash    c.fname  + std::hash    c.lname  + std::hash    c.no ;  Here, the hash value returned is just the sum of the hash value for the Customer’s attributes fname, lname, and no. If the predeﬁned hash functions for the types of these attributes work ﬁne for the given values, the result is the sum of three values in the range [0,std::size_t . According to the common overﬂow rules, the resulting value should then also be reasonably well distributed.  Note, however, that experts will claim that this is still a poor hash function and that providing a good hash function can be very tricky, In addition, providing such a hash function doesn’t seem as easy as it should be.  A better approach is the following, which uses a hash function provided by Boost  see [Boost]   and a more convenient interface:     cont hashval.hpp  include       from boost  functional hash :    see http:  www.boost.org doc libs 1_35_0 doc html hash combine.html template   inline void hash_combine  std::size_t& seed, const T& val  {  seed ^= std::hash    val  + 0x9e3779b9 +  seed >2 ;  }  15 error_code, thread::id, bitset , and vector    {  }  }  7.9 Unordered Containers  365     auxiliary generic functions to create a hash value using a seed template   inline void hash_val  std::size_t& seed, const T& val  {  hash_combine seed,val ;  } template   inline void hash_val  std::size_t& seed,  const T& val, const Types&... args   hash_combine seed,val ; hash_val seed,args... ;     auxiliary generic function to create a hash value out of a heterogeneous list of arguments template   inline std::size_t hash_val  const Types&... args  {  std::size_t seed = 0; hash_val  seed, args... ; return seed;  A convenience function implemented using variadic templates  see Section 3.1.9, page 26  allows calling hash_val   with an arbitrary number of elements of any type to process a hash value out of all these values. For example:  class CustomerHash {  public:  }  };  std::size_t operator    const Customer& c  const {  return hash_val c.fname,c.lname,c.no ;  Internally, hash_combine   is called, which some experience has shown to be a good candidate for a generic hash function  see [HoadZobel:HashCombine] .  Especially when the input values to the hash function have speciﬁc constraints, you might want to provide your own speciﬁc hash function. In any case, to verify the effect of your own hash function, you may use the bucket interface  see Section 7.9.7, page 380 .  See Section 7.9.7, page 377, for some complete examples about how to specify your own hash function. You can also use lambdas to specify the hash function  see Section 7.9.7, page 379, for details and an example .   366  Chapter 7: STL Containers  Providing Your Own Equivalence Criterion  As the third fourth template parameter of the unordered container types, you can pass the equivalence criterion, a predicate that is used to ﬁnd equal values in the same bucket. The default predicate is equal_to , which compares the elements with operator ==. For this reason, the most convenient approach to providing a valid equivalence criterion is to provide operator == for your own type if it is not predeﬁned either as member or as global function. For example:  class Customer {  ...  ...  }  }; bool operator ==  const Customer& c1, const Customer& c2  {  std::unordered_multiset  custmset; std::unordered_map  custmap;  Instead, however, you can also provide your own equivalence criterion as the following example demonstrates:  include    class Customer {  ...  };  class CustomerEqual {  public:  return ...  }  };  bool operator    const Customer& c1, Customer& c2  const {  std::unordered_set  custset; std::unordered_multimap<Customer,String,  CustomerHash,CustomerEqual> custmmap;  Here, for type Customer, a function object is deﬁned in which you have to implement operator   so that it compares two elements  or two keys for maps  and returns a Boolean value indicating whether they are equal.  See Section 7.9.7, page 377, for a complete example about how to provide your own equivalence criterion  and hash function . Again, you can also use lambdas to specify the equivalence criterion  see Section 7.9.7, page 379, for details and an example .   7.9 Unordered Containers  367  Whenever values are considered to be equal according to the current equivalence criterion, they should also yield the same hash values according to the current hash function. For this reason, an unordered container that is instantiated with a nondefault equivalence predicate usually needs a nondefault hash function as well.  7.9.3 Other Operations for Unordered Containers  The remaining operations for unordered containers are more or less the same as for associative containers.  Nonmodifying Operations  Unordered containers provide the nonmodifying operations listed in Table 7.50.  Operation c.empty    Effect Returns whether the container is empty  equivalent to size  ==0 but might be faster  Returns the current number of elements  c.size   c.max_size   Returns the maximum number of elements possible c1 == c2 c1 != c2  Returns whether c1 is equal to c2 Returns whether c1 is not equal to c2  equivalent to ! c1==c2    Table7.50. NonmodifyingOperationsofUnorderedContainers  Note again that for comparisons, only operators == and != are provided for unordered containers.16 In worst-case scenarios, they might, however, provide quadratic complexity.  Special Search Operations  Unordered containers are optimized for fast searching of elements. To beneﬁt from this behavior, the containers provide special search functions  see Table 7.51 . These functions are special versions of general algorithms that have the same name. You should always prefer the optimized versions for unordered containers to achieve constant complexity instead of the linear complexity of the general algorithms, provided that the hash values are evenly distributed. For example, a search in a collection of 1,000 elements requires on average only 1 comparison instead of 10 for associative containers and 500 for sequence containers  see Section 2.2, page 10 .  See Section 7.7.2, page 319, for a detailed description of these member functions, including an  example program that demonstrates their application.  16 Operators == and != are not provided for unordered containers with TR1.   Chapter 7: STL Containers  Effect Returns the number of elements with value val Returns the position of the ﬁrst element with value val  or end   if none found   c.equal_range val  Returns a range with all elements with a value equal to val  i.e., the  ﬁrst and last positions, where val would get inserted   Table7.51. SpecialSearchOperationsofUnorderedContainers  368  Operation c.count val  c.find val   Assignments  As listed in Table 7.52, unordered containers provide only the fundamental assignment operations that all containers provide  see Section 7.1.2, page 258 .  Operation c = c2 c = rv  c = initlist  c1.swap c2  swap c1,c2   Effect Assigns all elements of c2 to c Move assigns all elements of the rvalue rv to c  since C++11  Assigns all elements of the initializer list initlist to c  since C++11  Swaps the data of c1 and c2 Swaps the data of c1 and c2  Table7.52. AssignmentOperationsofUnorderedContainers  For these operations, both containers must have the same type. In particular, the type of the hash functions and the equivalence criteria must be the same, although the functions themselves may be different. If the functions are different, they will also get assigned or swapped.  Iterator Functions and Element Access  Unordered containers do not provide direct element access, so you have to use range-based for loops  see Section 3.1.4, page 17  or iterators. Because the iterators are guaranteed to be only forward ite- rators  see Section 9.2.3, page 436 , no support for bidirectional iterators or random-access iterators is provided  Table 7.53 . Thus, you can’t use them in algorithms that are provided for bidirectional iterators or random-access iterators only, such as algorithms for sorting or random shufﬂing.  For unordered  multi sets, all elements are considered constant from an iterator’s point of view. For unordered  multi maps, the key of all elements is considered to be constant. This is necessary to ensure that you can’t compromise the position of the elements by changing their values. Although there is no speciﬁc order, the value deﬁnes the bucket position according to the current hash function. For this reason, you can’t call any modifying algorithm on the elements. For example, you can’t call the remove   algorithm, because it “removes” by overwriting “removed” elements with the following elements  see Section 6.7.2, page 221, for a detailed discussion of this problem . To   7.9 Unordered Containers  369  Operation c.begin   c.end   c.cbegin   c.cend    c.rbegin   c.rend    Effect Returns a forward iterator for the ﬁrst element Returns a forward iterator for the position after the last element Returns a constant forward iterator for the ﬁrst element  since C++11  Returns a constant forward iterator for the position after the last element  since C++11  Returns a reverse iterator for the ﬁrst element of a reverse iteration Returns a reverse iterator for the position after the last element of a reverse iteration  c.crbegin   Returns a constant reverse iterator for the ﬁrst element of a reverse  c.crend    iteration  since C++11  Returns a constant reverse iterator for the position after the last element of a reverse iteration  since C++11   Table7.53. IteratorOperationsofUnorderedContainers  remove elements in unordered sets and multisets, you can use only member functions provided by the container.  In correspondence to maps and multimaps, the type of the elements of unordered maps and multimap is pair , which means that you need first and second to access the key and the value of an element  see Section 7.8.2, page 337 for details :  std::unordered_map  coll; ... for  auto elem& : coll  {  std::cout << "key: "  << elem.first  << "\t"  << "value: " << elem.second << std::endl;  } ... for  auto pos = coll.begin  ; pos != coll.end  ; ++pos  {  std::cout << "key: "   first  << "\t"   second << std::endl;  }  Trying to change the value of the key results in an error:  elem.first = "hello"; pos->first = "hello";     ERROR at compile time    ERROR at compile time  However, changing the value of the element is no problem, as long as elem is a nonconstant reference and the type of the value is not constant:  elem.second = 13.5; pos->second = 13.5;     OK    OK   370  Chapter 7: STL Containers  If you use algorithms and lambdas to operate on the elements of a map, you explicitly have to declare the element type:  std::unordered_map  coll; ...    add 10 to the value of each element: std::for_each  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  []  pair & elem  {  elem.second += 10;  } ;  Instead of using the following:  pair   you could also use  or  decltype coll ::value_type  unordered_map ::value_type  to declare the type of an element. See Section 7.8.5, page 345, for a complete example with maps that also works with unordered maps.  To change the key of an element, you have only one choice: You must replace the old element with a new element that has the same value. This is described for maps in Section 7.8.2, page 339. Note that unordered maps can also be used as associative arrays, so you can use the subscript  operator to access elements. See Section 7.9.5, page 374, for details.  Note also that there is an additional iterator interface to iterate over the buckets of an unordered  container. See Section 7.9.7, page 380, for details.  Inserting and Removing Elements  Table 7.54 shows the operations provided for unordered containers to insert and remove elements.  As usual when using the STL, you must ensure that the arguments are valid. Iterators must refer  to valid positions, and the beginning of a range must have a position that is not behind the end.  In general, erasing functions do not invalidate iterators and references to other elements. How- ever, the insert   and emplace   members may invalidate all iterators when rehashing happens, whereas references to elements always remain valid. Rehashing happens when, because of an inser- tion, the number of resulting elements is equal to or exceeds the bucket count times the maximum load factor  i.e., when the guarantee given by the maximum load factor would be broken . The insert   and emplace   members do not affect the validity of references to container elements. Inserting and removing is faster if, when working with multiple elements, you use a single call for all elements rather than multiple calls. Note, however, that the exception guarantees are reduced for multi-element operations  see Section 7.9.6, page 375 .  Note that the return types of the inserting functions insert   and emplace   differ as follows:   7.9 Unordered Containers  371  Operation c.insert val   c.insert pos,val   c.insert beg,end   c.insert initlist   c.emplace args...   c.erase val   c.erase pos   c.erase beg,end   c.clear    c.emplace_hint pos,args...   Effect Inserts a copy of val and returns the position of the new element and, for unordered containers, whether it succeeded Inserts a copy of val and returns the position of the new element  pos is used as a hint pointing to where the insert should start the search  Inserts a copy of all elements of the range [beg,end   returns nothing  Inserts a copy of all elements in the initializer list initlist  returns nothing; since C++11  Inserts a copy of an element initialized with args and returns the position of the new element and, for unordered containers, whether it succeeded  since C++11  Inserts a copy of an element initialized with args and returns the position of the new element  pos is used as a hint pointing to where the insert should start the search  Removes all elements equal to val and returns the number of removed elements Removes the element at iterator position pos and returns the following position  returned nothing before C++11  Removes all elements of the range [beg,end  and returns the following position  returned nothing before C++11  Removes all elements  empties the container   Table7.54. InsertandRemoveOperationsofUnorderedContainers    Unordered sets provide the following interface:  pair  insert const value_type& val ; iterator  insert iterator posHint,  const value_type& val ;  template   pair  emplace Args&&... args ; template   iterator  emplace_hint const_iterator posHint,    Unordered multisets provide the following interface:  Args&&... args ;  iterator iterator  insert const value_type& val ; insert iterator posHint,  const value_type& val ;  template   iterator  emplace Args&&... args ;   372  Chapter 7: STL Containers  template   iterator  emplace_hint const_iterator posHint,  Args&&... args ;  The difference in return types results because unordered multisets and multimaps allow duplicates, whereas unordered sets and maps do not. Thus, the insertion of an element might fail for an un- ordered set if it already contains an element with the same value. Therefore, the return type for a set returns two values by using a pair structure  pair is discussed in Section 5.1.1, page 60 : 1. The member second of the pair structure returns whether the insertion was successful. 2. The member first of the pair structure returns the position of the newly inserted element or  the position of the still existing element.  In all other cases, the functions return the position of the new element or of the existing element if the unordered set already contains an element with the same value. See Section 7.7.2, page 323, for some examples about these interfaces.  For unordered maps and multimaps, to insert a key value pair, you must keep in mind that inside, the key is considered to be constant. You must provide either the correct type or implicit or explicit type conversions.  Since C++11, the most convenient way to insert elements is to pass them as an initializer list,  where the ﬁrst entry is the key and the second entry is the value:  std::unordered_map  coll; ... coll.insert {"otto",22.3} ;  Alternatively, there are also the three other ways to pass a value into an unordered map or multimap that were introduced for maps and multimaps already  see Section 7.8.2, page 341, for details : 1. Use value_type:  std::unordered_map  coll; ... coll.insert std::unordered_map ::value_type  coll.insert decltype coll ::value_type "otto",22.3  ;   "otto",22.3  ;  2. Use pair :  std::unordered_map  coll; ... coll.insert std::pair  "otto",22.3  ; coll.insert std::pair  "otto",22.3  ;  3. Use make_pair  :  std::unordered_map  coll; ... coll.insert std::make_pair "otto",22.3  ;  Here is a simple example of the insertion of an element into an unordered map that also checks whether the insertion was successful:   7.9 Unordered Containers  373  std::unordered_map  coll; ... if  coll.insert std::make_pair "otto",22.3  .second  {  std::cout << "OK, could insert otto 22.3" << std::endl;  std::cout << "Oops, could not insert otto 22.3 "  << " key otto already exists " << std::endl;  } else {  }  Note again that when using emplace   to insert a new element by passing the values for its con- struction, you have to pass two lists of arguments: one for the key and one for the element. The most convenient way to do this is as follows:  std::unordered_map > m;  m.emplace std::piecewise_construct, std::make_tuple "hello" , std::make_tuple 3.4,7.8  ;     pass tuple elements as arguments    elements for the key    elements for the value  See Section 5.1.1, page 63, for details of piecewise construction of pairs.  Note again that unordered maps provide another convenient way to insert and set elements with  the subscript operator  see Section 7.9.5, page 374 .  To remove an element that has a certain value, you simply call erase  : std::unordered_set  coll; ...    remove all elements with passed value coll.erase value ;  Note that this member function has a different name than remove   provided for lists  see Sec- tion 7.5.2, page 294, for a discussion of remove   . It behaves differently because it returns the number of removed elements. When called for unordered maps, it returns only 0 or 1.  If an unordered multiset or multimap contains duplicates and you want to remove only the ﬁrst  element of these duplicates, you can’t use erase  . Instead, you can code as follows:  std::unordered_multimap  coll; ...    remove ﬁrst element with passed value auto pos = coll.find value ; if  pos != coll.end    {  coll.erase pos ;  }  You should use the member function find   here because it is faster than the find   algorithm  see the example in Section 7.3.2, page 277 .  When removing elements, be careful not to saw off the branch on which you are sitting. See  Section 7.8.2, page 342, for a detailed description of this problem.   374  Chapter 7: STL Containers  7.9.4 The Bucket Interface  It is possible to access the individual buckets with a speciﬁc bucket interface to expose the internal state of the whole hash table. Table 7.55 shows the operations provided to directly access buckets.  Operation c.bucket_count   c.bucket val   Effect Returns the current number of buckets Returns the index of the bucket in which val would could be found  c.end buckidx   c.bucket_size buckidx  Returns the number of elements in the bucket with index buckidx Returns a forward iterator for the ﬁrst element of the bucket with c.begin buckidx  index buckidx Returns a forward iterator for the position after the last element of the bucket with index buckidx Returns a constant forward iterator for the ﬁrst element of the bucket with index buckidx Returns a constant forward iterator for the position after the last element of the bucket with index buckidx  c.cbegin buckidx   c.cend buckidx   Table7.55. BucketInterfaceOperationsofUnorderedSetsandMultisets  See Section 7.9.7, page 380, for an example of how to use the bucket interface to inspect the internal layout of an unordered container.  7.9.5 Using Unordered Maps as Associative Arrays  As with maps, unordered maps provide a subscript operator for direct element access and a corre- sponding member function at    see Table 7.56 .  Operation Effect c[key]  Inserts an element with key, if it does not yet exist, and returns a reference to the value of the element with key  only for nonconstant unordered maps   c.at key  Returns a reference to the value of the element with key  since C++11   Table7.56. DirectElementAccessofUnorderedMaps  at   yields the value of the element with the passed key and throws an exception object of type out_of_range if no such element is present.  For operator [ ], the index also is the key used to identify the element. This means that for operator [ ], the index may have any type rather than only an integral type. Such an interface is the interface of a so-called associative array.  For operator [ ], the type of the index is not the only difference from ordinary C-style arrays. In addition, you can’t have a wrong index. If you use a key as the index for which no element yet   7.9 Unordered Containers  375  exists, a new element gets inserted into the map automatically. The value of the new element is initialized by the default constructor of its type. Thus, to use this feature, you can’t use a value type that has no default constructor. Note that the fundamental data types provide a default constructor that initializes their values to zero  see Section 3.2.1, page 37 .  See Section 7.8.3, page 344, for a detailed discussion of the advantages and disadvantages this container interface provides. See Section 6.2.4, page 185, and Section 7.8.5, page 346, for some example code  partially using maps, which provide the same interface .  7.9.6 Exception Handling  Unordered containers are node-based containers, so any failure to construct a node simply leaves the container as it was. However, the fact that a rehashing may occur comes into account. For this reason, the following guarantees apply to all unordered containers:   Single-element insertions have the commit-or-rollback behavior, provided that the hash and equivalence functions don’t throw. Thus, if they don’t throw, the operations either succeed or have no effect.   erase   does not throw an exception, provided that the hash function and the equivalence crite-   No clear   function throws an exception.   No swap   function throws an exception, provided that the copy constructor or the copy assign-   rehash   has the commit-or-rollback behavior, provided that the hash and equivalence functions  ment operator of the hash or equivalence functions don’t throw.  rion don’t throw, which is the case for the default functions.  don’t throw. Thus, if they don’t throw, the operations either succeed or have no effect. See Section 6.12.2, page 248, for a general discussion of exception handling in the STL.  7.9.7 Examples of Using Unordered Containers  The following program demonstrates the fundamental abilities of unordered containers, using an unordered set:     cont unordset1.cpp  include   include   include "print.hpp" using namespace std;  int main   {     create and initialize unordered set unordered_set  coll = { 1,2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,77 };     print elements    - elements are in arbitrary order   376  Chapter 7: STL Containers  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll ;     insert some additional elements    - might cause rehashing and create different order coll.insert {-7,17,33,-11,17,19,1,13} ; PRINT_ELEMENTS coll ;     remove element with speciﬁc value coll.erase 33 ;     insert sum of all existing values coll.insert accumulate coll.begin  ,coll.end  ,0  ; PRINT_ELEMENTS coll ;     check if value 19 is in the set if  coll.find 19  != coll.end    {  cout << "19 is available" << endl;  }     remove all negative values unordered_set ::iterator pos; for  pos=coll.begin  ; pos!= coll.end  ;   {  if  *pos < 0  {  pos = coll.erase pos ;  } else {  }  ++pos;  } PRINT_ELEMENTS coll ;  }  As long as you only insert, erase, and ﬁnd elements with a speciﬁc value, unordered containers provide the best running-time behavior because all these operations have amortized constant com- plexity. However, you can’t make any assumption about the order of the elements. For example, the program might have the following output:  77 11 1 13 2 3 5 17 7 19 -11 1 2 3 -7 5 7 77 33 11 13 17 19 -11 1 2 3 -7 5 7 77 11 13 17 19 137 19 is available 1 2 3 5 7 77 11 13 17 19 137   7.9 Unordered Containers  377  For anything else – for example, to accumulate the values in the container or ﬁnd and remove all negative values — you have to iterate over all elements  either directly with iterators or indirectly using a range-based for loop .  When using an unordered multiset rather than an unordered set, duplicates are allowed. For  example, the following program:     cont unordmultiset1.cpp  include   include "print.hpp" using namespace std;  int main   {     create and initialize, expand, and print unordered multiset unordered_multiset  coll = { 1,2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,77 }; coll.insert {-7,17,33,-11,17,19,1,13} ; PRINT_ELEMENTS coll ;     remove all elements with speciﬁc value coll.erase 17 ;     remove one of the elements with speciﬁc value auto pos = coll.find 13 ; if  pos != coll.end    {  coll.erase pos ;  } PRINT_ELEMENTS coll ;  }  might have the following output:  33 19 19 17 17 17 77 11 7 -7 5 3 13 13 2 -11 1 1 33 19 19 77 11 7 -7 5 3 13 2 -11 1 1  Example of Providing Your Own Hash Function and Equivalence Criterion  The following example shows how to deﬁne and specify a hash function and an equivalence criterion for a type Customer, which is used as element type of an unordered set:     cont hashfunc1.cpp  include   include   include   include "hashval.hpp" include "print.hpp"   378  Chapter 7: STL Containers  using namespace std;  class Customer {  private:  string fname; string lname; long  no;  public:  class CustomerHash {  public:  };  }  };  class CustomerEqual {  public:  }  };  int main   {  }  Customer  const string& fn, const string& ln, long n   : fname fn , lname ln , no n  {}  friend ostream& operator <<  ostream& strm, const Customer& c  {  return strm << "[" << c.fname << "," << c.lname << ","  << c.no << "]";  } friend class CustomerHash; friend class CustomerEqual;  std::size_t operator    const Customer& c  const {  return hash_val c.fname,c.lname,c.no ;  bool operator    const Customer& c1, Customer& c2  const {  return c1.no == c2.no;     unordered set with own hash function and equivalence criterion unordered_set  custset;  custset.insert Customer "nico","josuttis",42  ; PRINT_ELEMENTS custset ;   7.9 Unordered Containers  379  The program has the following output:  [nico,josuttis,42]  Here, the hash_val   convenience function for an arbitrary number of elements of different types introduced in Section 7.9.2, page 364, is used.  As you can see, the equivalence function does not necessarily have to evaluate the same values as the hash function. However, as written, it should be guaranteed that values that are equal according the equivalence criterion yield the same hash value  which indirectly is the case here assuming that customer numbers are unique .  Without specifying an equivalence function, the declaration of custset would be: std::unordered_set  custset;  and operator == would be used as equivalence criterion, which you had to deﬁne for Customers instead.  You could also use an ordinary function as hash function. But in that case you have to pass the function as constructor argument, which means that you also have to pass the initial bucket count and specify the corresponding function pointer as second template parameter  see Section 7.9.2, page 363, for details .  Using Lambdas as Hash Function and Equivalence Criterion  You can even use lambdas to specify the hash function and or the equivalence criterion. For example:     cont hashfunc2.cpp  include   include   include   include "hashval.hpp" include "print.hpp" using namespace std;  class Customer {  private:  string fname; string lname; long  no;  public:  Customer  const string& fn, const string& ln, long n   : fname fn , lname ln , no n  {  } string firstname   const {  return fname;  };   380  Chapter 7: STL Containers  string lastname   const {  return lname;  }; long number   const {  return no;  }; friend ostream& operator <<  ostream& strm, const Customer& c  {  return strm << "[" << c.fname << "," << c.lname << ","  << c.no << "]";  }  };  int main   {  };  };  }     lambda for user-deﬁned hash function auto hash = []  const Customer& c  {  return hash_val c.firstname  ,c.lastname  ,c.number   ;     lambda for user-deﬁned equality criterion auto eq = []  const Customer& c1, Customer& c2  {  return c1.number   == c2.number  ;     create unordered set with user-deﬁned behavior unordered_set<Customer,  decltype hash ,decltype eq > custset 10,hash,eq ;  custset.insert Customer "nico","josuttis",42  ; PRINT_ELEMENTS custset ;  Note that you have to use decltype to yield the type of the lambda to be able to pass it as template argument to the declaration of the unordered container. The reason is that for lambdas, no default constructor and assignment operator are deﬁned. Therefore, you also have to pass the lambdas to the constructor. This is possible only as second and third arguments. Thus, you have to specify the initial bucket size 10 in this case.  Example of Using the Bucket Interface  The following example demonstrates an application of the bucket interface provided to inspect the internal state of an unordered container  see Section 7.9.4, page 374 . In printHashTableState  , the whole state, including the detailed layout of an unordered container, is printed:   7.9 Unordered Containers  381     cont buckets.hpp  include   include   include   include   include       generic output for pairs  map elements  template   std::ostream& operator  & p  {  return strm << "[" << p.first << "," << p.second << "]";  template   void printHashTableState  const T& cont  {     basic layout data: std::cout << "size: std::cout << "buckets: std::cout << "load factor: std::cout << "max load factor: " << cont.max_load_factor   << "\n";  " << cont.size   << "\n"; " << cont.bucket_count   << "\n"; " << cont.load_factor   << "\n";     iterator category: if  typeid typename std::iterator_traits   ::iterator_category   == typeid std::bidirectional_iterator_tag   {  std::cout << "chaining style:  doubly-linked" << "\n";  } else {  }  std::cout << "chaining style:  singly-linked" << "\n";     elements per bucket: std::cout << "data: " << "\n"; for  auto idx=0; idx != cont.bucket_count  ; ++idx  {  std::cout << " b[" << std::setw 2  << idx << "]: "; for  auto pos=cont.begin idx ; pos != cont.end idx ; ++pos  {  std::cout << *pos << " ";  } std::cout << "\n";  } std::cout << std::endl;  }  }   382  Chapter 7: STL Containers  For example, you can use this header ﬁle to print the internal layout of an unordered set:     cont unordinspect1.cpp  include   include   include "buckets.hpp"  int main   {     create and initialize an unordered set std::unordered_set  intset = { 1,2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19 }; printHashTableState intset ;     insert some additional values  might cause rehashing  intset.insert {-7,17,33,4} ; printHashTableState intset ;  }  Comparing the ﬁrst and second call of printHashTableState  , the program might have the following output  details depend on the concrete layout and rehashing strategy of the standard library used :  9 11 0.818182  size: buckets: load factor: max load factor: 1 chaining style: data:  singly-linked  12 23 0.521739  size: buckets: load factor: max load factor: 1 chaining style: singly-linked data:  b[ 0]: 11 b[ 1]: 1 b[ 2]: 13 2 b[ 3]: 3 b[ 4]: b[ 5]: 5 b[ 6]: 17 b[ 7]: 7 b[ 8]: 19 b[ 9]: b[10]:  b[ 0]: b[ 1]: 1 b[ 2]: 2 b[ 3]: 3 b[ 4]: 4 b[ 5]: 5 -7 b[ 6]: b[ 7]: 7 b[ 8]: b[ 9]: b[10]: 33 b[11]: 11 b[12]: b[13]: 13 b[14]: b[15]: b[16]: b[17]: 17 b[18]: b[19]: 19 b[20]: b[21]: b[22]:   7.9 Unordered Containers  383  As another example for the application of the bucket interface, the following program creates a dictionary of string values mapped to other string values  compare this example with a corresponding version for maps in Section 7.8.5, page 348 :     cont unordmultimap1.cpp  include   include   include   include   include "buckets.hpp" using namespace std;  int main   {     create and initialize an unordered multimap as dictionary std::unordered_multimap  dict = {  {"day","Tag"}, {"strange","fremd"}, {"car","Auto"}, {"smart","elegant"}, {"trait","Merkmal"}, {"strange","seltsam"}  }; printHashTableState dict ;     insert some additional values  might cause rehashing  dict.insert {{"smart","raffiniert"},  {"smart","klug"}, {"clever","raffiniert"}  } ;  printHashTableState dict ;     modify maximum load factor  might cause rehashing  dict.max_load_factor 0.7 ; printHashTableState dict ;  }  Again, the output of this program is implementation speciﬁc. For example, the output of this program might be as follows  slightly modiﬁed to ﬁt the page width :   384  Chapter 7: STL Containers  6 7  size: buckets: current load factor: 0.857143 max load factor: chaining style: data:  1 singly  b[ 0]: [day,Tag] b[ 1]: [car,Auto] b[ 2]: b[ 3]: [smart,elegant] b[ 4]: b[ 5]: [trait,Merkmal] b[ 6]: [strange,fremd]  [strange,seltsam]  9 11  size: buckets: current load factor: 0.818182 max load factor: chaining style: data:  1 singly  b[ 0]: [smart,elegant]  [smart,raffiniert]  [smart,klug]  b[ 1]: b[ 2]: b[ 3]: b[ 4]: b[ 5]: [clever,raffiniert] b[ 6]: [strange,fremd]  [strange,seltsam]  b[ 7]: b[ 8]: b[ 9]: [trait,Merkmal] [car,Auto] b[10]: [day,Tag]  6 11  size: buckets: current load factor: 0.545455 max load factor: chaining style: data:  1 singly  b[ 0]: b[ 1]: b[ 2]: [trait,Merkmal]  [car,Auto]  b[ 3]: [day,Tag] b[ 4]: b[ 5]: b[ 6]: b[ 7]: b[ 8]: [smart,elegant] b[ 9]: [strange,seltsam]  [strange,fremd]  b[10]:  9 11  size: buckets: current load factor: 0.818182 max load factor: chaining style: data:  1 singly  b[ 0]: b[ 1]: b[ 2]: [clever,raffiniert]  [trait,Merkmal]  [car,Auto]  b[ 3]: [day,Tag] b[ 4]: b[ 5]: b[ 6]: b[ 7]: b[ 8]: [smart,elegant]  [smart,raffiniert]  [smart,klug]  b[ 9]: [strange,seltsam]  [strange,fremd]  b[10]:  9 17  size: buckets: current load factor: 0.529412 max load factor: chaining style: data:  0.7 singly  b[ 0]: b[ 1]: b[ 2]: b[ 3]: b[ 4]: [car,Auto] b[ 5]: b[ 6]: [smart,elegant]  [smart,raffiniert]  [smart,klug]  b[ 7]: b[ 8]: [day,Tag] b[ 9]: [clever,raffiniert] b[10]: b[11]: [trait,Merkmal] b[12]: b[13]: b[14]: b[15]: [strange,fremd]  [strange,seltsam]  b[16]:  9 13  size: buckets: current load factor: 0.692308 max load factor: chaining style: data:  0.7 singly  b[ 0]: b[ 1]: [day,Tag] b[ 2]: b[ 3]: b[ 4]: [smart,elegant]  [smart,raffiniert]  [smart,klug]  [car,Auto]  b[ 5]: b[ 6]: b[ 7]: b[ 8]: b[ 9]: [clever,raffiniert] b[10]: [strange,seltsam]  [strange,fremd]  b[11]: b[12]: [trait,Merkmal]  [clever,raffiniert]  Whereas on another platform the output of this program might be as follows  again, slightly modiﬁed to ﬁt the page width :  Note that in any case rehashing preserves the relative ordering of equivalent elements. However, the order of equivalent elements might not match the order of their insertion.   7.10 Other STL Containers  385  7.10 Other STL Containers  The STL is a framework. In addition to the standard container classes, the STL allows you to use other data structures as containers. You can use strings or ordinary arrays as STL containers, or you can write and use special containers that meet special needs. Doing so has the advantage that you can beneﬁt from algorithms, such as sorting or merging, for your own type. Such a framework is a good example of the Open Closed Principle: open to extension; closed to modiﬁcation.17  There are three different approaches to making containers “STL-able”:  1. The invasive approach.18 You simply provide the interface that an STL container requires. In particular, you need the usual member functions of containers, such as begin   and end  . This approach is invasive because it requires that a container be written in a certain way.  2. The noninvasive approach.18 You write or provide special iterators that are used as an interface between the algorithms and special containers. This approach is noninvasive. All it requires is the ability to step through all the elements of a container, an ability that any container provides in some way.  3. The wrapper approach. Combining the two previous approaches, you write a wrapper class  that encapsulates any data structure with an STL container-like interface.  This subsection ﬁrst discusses strings as a standard container, which is an example of the invasive approach. It then covers an important standard container that uses the noninvasive approach: ordi- nary C-style arrays. However, you can also use the wrapper approach to access data of an ordinary array.  Whoever wants to write an STL container might also support the ability to get parametrized on different allocators. The C++ standard library provides some special functions and classes for programming with allocators and uninitialized memory. See Section 19.3, page 1026, for details.  7.10.1 Strings as STL Containers  The string classes of the C++ standard library  introduced and discussed in Chapter 13  are an example of the invasive approach of writing STL containers. Strings can be considered containers of characters. The characters inside the string build a sequence over which you can iterate to process the individual characters. Thus, the standard string classes provide the container interface of the STL. They provide the begin   and end   member functions, which return random-access itera- tors to iterate over a string. The string classes also provide some operations for iterators and iterator adapters. For example, push_back   is provided to enable the use of back inserters.  Note that string processing from the STL’s point of view is a bit unusual. Normally you process strings as a whole object  you pass, copy, or assign strings . However, when individual character processing is of interest, the ability to use STL algorithms might be helpful. For example, you could read the characters with istream iterators, or you could transform string characters by making them  17 I ﬁrst heard of the Open Closed Principle from Robert C. Martin, who himself heard it from Bertrand Meyer. 18 Instead of invasive and noninvasive, the terms intrusive and nonintrusive are sometimes used.   Chapter 7: STL Containers  386  ples.  uppercase or lowercase. In addition, by using STL algorithms you can use a special comparison criterion for strings. The standard string interface does not provide that ability.  Section 13.2.14, page 684, discusses the STL aspects of strings in more detail and gives exam-  7.10.2 Ordinary C-Style Arrays as STL Containers  You can use ordinary C-style arrays as STL containers. However, ordinary C-style arrays are not classes, so they don’t provide member functions such as begin   and end  , and you can’t deﬁne member functions for them. Here, either the noninvasive approach or the wrapper approach must be used.  Using the noninvasive approach is simple. You need only objects that are able to iterate over the elements of an array by using the STL iterator interface. Such iterators already exist: ordinary pointers. An STL design decision was to use the pointer interface for iterators so that you could use ordinary pointers as iterators. This again shows the generic concept of pure abstraction: Any- thing that behaves like an iterator is an iterator. In fact, pointers are random-access iterators  see Section 9.2.5, page 438 . The following example demonstrates how to use C-style arrays as STL containers since C++11:     cont cstylearray1.cpp  include   include   include    int main   {  int vals[] = { 33, 67, -4, 13, 5, 2 };     use begin   and end   for ordinary C arrays std::vector  v std::begin vals , std::end vals  ;     use global begin   and end   for containers: std::copy  std::begin v , std::end v ,  std::ostream_iterator  std::cout," "  ;  std::cout << std::endl;  }  Here, we use a helper function deﬁned in   and every container header, which allows using a global begin   and end   for ordinary C-style arrays. As you can see, for any ordinary C-style array, vals std::begin   and std::end   yield the corresponding begin and end to use it in the STL framework:   7.10 Other STL Containers  387  int vals[] = { 33, 67, -4, 13, 5, 2 };  std::begin vals  std::end vals      yields vals    yields vals+NumOfElementsIn vals   These functions are also overloaded, so you can use STL containers or all classes that provide begin   and end   as member functions:  std::vector  v;  std::begin v  std::end v      yields v.begin      yields v.end    The output of the program is as follows:  33 67 -4 13 5 2  Before C++11, you had to pass the raw pointers to the algorithms because begin   and end   were not globally provided. For example:     cont cstylearray1old.cpp  include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {  int coll[] = { 5, 6, 2, 4, 1, 3 };     square all elements transform  coll, coll+6,  coll, coll, multiplies    ;     ﬁrst source    second source    destination    operation     sort beginning with the second element sort  coll+1, coll+6 ;     print all elements copy  coll, coll+6,  cout << endl;  }  ostream_iterator  cout," "  ;   388  Chapter 7: STL Containers  You had to be careful to pass the correct end of the array, as is done here by using coll+6. And, as usual, you have to make sure that the end of the range is the position after the last element.  The output of the program is as follows: 25 1 4 9 16 36  Additional examples for the use of ordinary C-style arrays are in Section 11.7.2, page 579, and in Section 11.10.2, page 620.  7.11 Implementing Reference Semantics  In general, STL container classes provide value semantics and not reference semantics. Thus, the containers create internal copies of the elements they contain and return copies of those elements. Section 6.11.2, page 245, discusses the pros and cons of this approach and touches on its conse- quences. To summarize, if you want reference semantics in STL containers — whether because copying elements is expensive or because identical elements will be shared by different collections — you should use a smart pointer class that avoids possible errors. In addition, using a reference wrapper is possible.  Using Shared Pointers  As introduced in Section 5.2, page 76, the C++ standard library provides different smart pointer classes. For sharing objects between different containers, class shared_ptr  is the appropriate smart pointer class. Using it for this purpose looks as follows:     cont refsem1.cpp  include   include   include   include   include   include    class Item {  private:  std::string name; float public:  price;  return name;  }  Item  const std::string& n, float p = 0  : name n , price p  { } std::string getName    const {   7.11 Implementing Reference Semantics  389  void setName  const std::string& n  {  name = n;  } float getPrice    const {  return price;  } float setPrice  float p  {  price = p;  }  };  template   void printItems  const std::string& msg, const Coll& coll  {  std::cout << msg << std::endl; for  const auto& elem : coll  {  std::cout  getName   << ": "   getPrice   << std::endl;  }  }  int main   {  using namespace std;     two different collections sharing Items typedef shared_ptr  ItemPtr; set  allItems; deque  bestsellers;     insert objects into the collections    - bestsellers are in both collections bestsellers = { ItemPtr new Item "Kong Yize",20.10  ,  ItemPtr new Item "A Midsummer Night’s Dream",14.99  , ItemPtr new Item "The Maltese Falcon",9.88   };  allItems = { ItemPtr new Item "Water",0.44  ,  ItemPtr new Item "Pizza",2.22   };  allItems.insert bestsellers.begin  ,bestsellers.end   ;     print contents of both collections printItems  "bestsellers:", bestsellers ; printItems  "all:", allItems ; cout << endl;   390  Chapter 7: STL Containers     double price of bestsellers for_each  bestsellers.begin  , bestsellers.end  ,  []  shared_ptr & elem  {  elem->setPrice elem->getPrice   * 2 ;  } ;     replace second bestseller by ﬁrst item with name "Pizza" bestsellers[1] = * find_if allItems.begin  ,allItems.end  ,  []  shared_ptr  elem  {  return elem->getName   == "Pizza";  }  ;     set price of ﬁrst bestseller bestsellers[0]->setPrice 44.77 ;     print contents of both collections printItems  "bestsellers:", bestsellers ; printItems  "all:", allItems ;  }  all:  The program has the following output:  bestsellers:  Kong Yize: 20.1 A Midsummer Night’s Dream: 14.99 The Maltese Falcon: 9.88  Kong Yize: 20.1 A Midsummer Night’s Dream: 14.99 The Maltese Falcon: 9.88 Water: 0.44 Pizza: 2.22  bestsellers:  Kong Yize: 44.77 Pizza: 2.22 The Maltese Falcon: 19.76  all:  Kong Yize: 44.77 A Midsummer Night’s Dream: 29.98 The Maltese Falcon: 19.76 Water: 0.44 Pizza: 2.22   7.11 Implementing Reference Semantics  391  Note that using shared_ptr  makes things signiﬁcantly more complicated. For example, find   for sets, which looks for elements that have an equal value, will now compare the internal pointers returned by new:  allItems.find ItemPtr new Item "Pizza",2.22        can’t be successful  So, you have to use the find_if   algorithm here.  If you call an auxiliary function that saves one element of the collections  an ItemPtr  some- where else, the value to which it refers stays valid even if the collections get destroyed or all their elements are removed.  Using the Reference Wrapper  If it is guaranteed that the elements referred to in a container exist as long as the container exists, another approach is possible: using class reference_wrapper   see Section 5.4.3, page 132 . For example, the following is possible, using class Item as introduced in the previous example:    elements are references  std::vector > books;  Item f "Faust",12.99 ; books.push_back f ;     insert book by reference     print books: for  const auto& book : books  {  std::cout << book.get  .getName   << ": "  << book.get  .getPrice   << std::endl;  }  }  f.setPrice 9.99 ; std::cout << books[0].get  .getPrice   << std::endl;    print price of ﬁrst book     modify book outside the containers     print books using type of the elements  no get   necessary : for  const Item& book : books  {  std::cout << book.getName   << ": " << book.getPrice   << std::endl;  The advantage is that no pointer syntax is required. This, however, is also a risk because it’s not obvious that references are used here.  Note that the following declaration isn’t possible: vector  books;  Note also that class reference_wrapper  provides a conversion operator to T& so that the range- based for loop can be declared dealing with elements of type Item&. However, for a direct call of a member function for the ﬁrst element, get   is necessary.  The program has following output  see cont refwrap1.cpp for the complete example : Faust: 12.99 9.99 Faust: 9.99   392  Chapter 7: STL Containers  7.12 When to Use Which Container  As a supplement to the table, the following rules of thumb might help:  The C++ standard library provides different container types with different abilities. The question now is: When do you use which container type? Table 7.57 provides an overview. However, it contains general statements that might not ﬁt in reality. For example, if you manage only a few elements, you can ignore the complexity because short element processing with linear complexity is better than long element processing with logarithmic complexity  in practice, “few” might become very large here .   By default, you should use a vector.  It has the simplest internal data structure and provides random access. Thus, data access is convenient and ﬂexible, and data processing is often fast enough.   If you insert and or remove elements often at the beginning and the end of a sequence, you should use a deque. You should also use a deque if it is important that the amount of internal memory used by the container shrinks when elements are removed. Also, because a vector usually uses one block of memory for its elements, a deque might be able to contain more elements because it uses several blocks.   If you insert, remove, and move elements often in the middle of a container, consider using a list. Lists provide special member functions to move elements from one container to another in constant time. Note, however, that because a list provides no random access, you might suffer signiﬁcant performance penalties on access to elements inside the list if you have only the beginning of the list.  Like all node-based containers, a list doesn’t invalidate iterators that refer to elements, as long as those elements are part of the container. Vectors invalidate all their iterators, pointers, and references whenever they exceed their capacity and part of their iterators, pointers, and references on insertions and deletions. Deques invalidate iterators, pointers, and references when they change their size, respectively.   If you need a container that handles exceptions so that each operation either succeeds or has no effect, you should use either a list  without calling assignment operations and sort   and, if comparing the elements may throw, without calling merge  , remove  , remove_if  , and unique  ; see Section 7.5.3, page 296  or an associative unordered container  without calling the multiple-element insert operations and, if copying assigning the comparison criterion may throw, without calling swap   or erase   . See Section 6.12.2, page 248, for a general discus- sion of exception handling in the STL.   If you often need to search for elements according to a certain criterion, use an unordered set or multiset that hashes according to this criterion. However, hash containers have no ordering, so if you need to rely on element order, you should use a set or a multiset that sorts elements according to the search criterion.   To process key value pairs, use an unordered  multi map or, if the element order matters, a   If you need an associative array, use an unordered map or, if the element order matters, a map.

OverviewofContainerAbilities   394  Chapter 7: STL Containers  A problem that is not easy to solve is how to sort objects according to two different sorting criteria. For example, you might have to keep elements in an order provided by the user while providing search capabilities according to another criterion. As in databases, you need fast access about two or more different criteria. In this case, you could probably use two sets or two maps that share the same objects with different sorting criteria. However, having objects in two collections is a special issue, covered in Section 7.11, page 388.  The automatic sorting of associative containers does not mean that these containers perform better when sorting is needed. This is because an associative container sorts each time a new element gets inserted. An often faster way is to use a sequence container and to sort all elements after they are all inserted, by using one of the several sort algorithms  see Section 11.2.2, page 511 .  The following two simple programs sort all strings read from the standard input and print them  without duplicates, by using two different containers: 1. Using a set:     cont sortset.cpp  include   include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {  }  2. Using a vector:     cont sortvec.cpp  include   include   include   include   include       create a string set    - initialized by all words from standard input set  coll  istream_iterator  cin  ,  istream_iterator    ;     print all elements copy  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  ostream_iterator  cout, "\n"  ;   7.12 When to Use Which Container  395  using namespace std;  int main   {     create a string vector    - initialized by all words from standard input vector  coll  istream_iterator  cin  ,  istream_iterator    ;     sort elements sort  coll.begin  , coll.end   ;     print all elements ignoring subsequent duplicates unique_copy  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  ostream_iterator  cout, "\n"  ;  }  When I tried both programs with about 350,000 strings on one system, the vector version was ap- proximately 10% faster. Inserting a call of reserve   made the vector version 5% faster. Allowing duplicates — using a multiset instead of a set and calling copy   instead of unique_copy  , respectively — changed things dramatically: The vector version was more than 40% faster. How- ever, on another system, the vector versions were up to 50% slower. These measurements are not representative, but they show that it is often worth trying different ways of processing elements.  In practice, predicting which container type is the best is often difﬁcult. The big advantage of the STL is that you can try different versions without much effort. The major work — implementing the different data structures and algorithms — is done. You have only to combine them in a way that is best for you.   This page intentionally left blank    Chapter 8 STL Container Members in Detail  This chapter discusses in detail all the operations that STL containers provide. The types and mem- bers are grouped by functionality. For each type and operation, this chapter describes the signature, the behavior, and the container types that provide it. Possible containers types are array, vector, deque, list, forward list, set, multiset, map, multimap, unordered set, unordered multiset, unordered map, unordered multimap, and string.

It covers iterator categories, iterator-speciﬁc operations, iterator adapters, and user-deﬁned iterators.  9.1 Header Files for Iterators  All containers deﬁne their own iterator types, so you don’t need a special header ﬁle for using iter- ators of containers. However, several deﬁnitions for special iterators, such as reverse iterators, and some auxiliary iterator functions are introduced by the   header ﬁle. Some implementa- tions include this header ﬁle for any container to deﬁne its reverse iterator types. This, however, is not portable. Thus, when you need more than ordinary container iterators and their type, you should include this header.  9.2 Iterator Categories  Iterators are objects that can iterate over elements of a sequence via a common interface that is adapted from ordinary pointers  see Section 6.3, page 188 . Iterators follow the concept of pure abstraction: Anything that behaves like an iterator is an iterator. However, iterators have different abilities. These abilities are important because some algorithms require special iterator abilities. For example, sorting algorithms require iterators that can perform random access because otherwise, the runtime would be poor. For this reason, iterators have different categories  Figure 9.1 . The abilities of these categories are listed in Table 9.1 and discussed in the following subsections.  Reading iterators that can also write are called mutable iterators  for example, mutable forward  iterator .  9.2.1 Output Iterators  Output iterators can only step forward with write access. Thus, you can assign new values only element-by-element. You can’t use an output iterator to iterate twice over the same range. In fact, it   434  Chapter 9: STL Iterators  Input iterator  Output iterator  Forward iterator  Bidirectional iterator  Random−access iterator  Figure9.1.

AbilitiesofIteratorCategories  is even not guaranteed that you can assign a value twice without incrementing the iterator. The goal is to write a value into a “black hole” in the following way:  while  ...  {  *pos = ...; ++pos;  }     assign a value    advance  prepare for the next assignment   Table 9.2 lists the valid operations for output iterators. The only valid use of operator * is on the left side of an assignment statement.  No comparison operations are required for output iterators. You can’t check whether an output iterator is valid or whether a “writing” was successful. You can only write, and write, and write values. Usually, the end of a writing is deﬁned by an additional requirement for speciﬁc output iterators.   9.2 Iterator Categories  435  Effect  Expression *iter = val Writes val to where the iterator refers Steps forward  returns new position  ++iter Steps forward  returns old position  iter++ TYPE iter  Copies iterator  copy constructor   Table9.2. OperationsofOutputIterators  Often, iterators can read and write values. For this reason, all reading iterators might have the additional ability to write. In that case, they are called mutable iterators.  A typical example of a pure output iterator is one that writes to the standard output  for example, to the screen or a printer . If you use two output iterators to write to the screen, the second word follows the ﬁrst rather than overwriting it. Inserters are another typical example of output iterators. Inserters are iterators that insert values into containers. If you assign a value, you insert it. If you then write a second value, you don’t overwrite the ﬁrst value; you just also insert it. Inserters are discussed in Section 9.4.2, page 454.  All const_iterators provided by containers and their member functions cbegin   and  cend   are not output iterators, because they don’t allow you to write to where the iterator refers.  9.2.2 Input Iterators  Input iterators can only step forward element-by-element with read access. Thus, they return values element-wise. Table 9.3 lists the operations of input iterators.  Expression *iter iter ->member ++iter iter++ iter1 == iter2 iter1 != iter2 TYPE iter   Effect Provides read access to the actual element Provides read access to a member of the actual element Steps forward  returns new position  Steps forward Returns whether two iterators are equal Returns whether two iterators are not equal Copies iterator  copy constructor   Table9.3. OperationsofInputIterators  Input iterators can read elements only once. Thus, if you copy an input iterator and let the original and the copy read forward, they might iterate over different values.  All iterators that refer to values to process have the abilities of input iterators. Usually, however, they can have more. A typical example of a pure input iterator is one that reads from the standard input, which is typically the keyboard. The same value can’t be read twice. Once a word is read from an input stream, the next read access returns another word.   436  Chapter 9: STL Iterators  For input iterators, operators == and != are provided only to check whether an iterator is equal to a past-the-end iterator. This is required because operations that deal with input iterators usually do the following:  InputIterator pos, end;  while  pos != end  {     read-only access using *pos  ... ++pos;  }  There is no guarantee that two different iterators that are both not past-the-end iterators compare unequal if they refer to different positions.  This requirement is introduced with forward iterators.  Note also that for input iterators it is not required that the postincrement operator iter++ returns  something. Usually, however, it returns the old position.  You should always prefer the preincrement operator over the postincrement operator because it might perform better. This is because the preincrement operator does not have to return an old value that must be stored in a temporary object. So, for any iterator pos  and any abstract data type , you should prefer  ++pos rather than pos++     OK and fast     OK, but not so fast  9.2.3 Forward Iterators  The same applies to decrement operators, as long as they are deﬁned  they aren’t for input iterators .  Forward iterators are input iterators that provide additional guarantees while reading forward. Table 9.4 summarizes the operations of forward iterators.  Effect Provides access to the actual element Provides access to a member of the actual element Steps forward  returns new position  Steps forward  returns old position   Expression *iter iter->member ++iter iter++ iter1 == iter2 Returns whether two iterators are equal iter1 != iter2 Returns whether two iterators are not equal TYPE   TYPE iter  iter1 = iter2  Creates iterator  default constructor  Copies iterator  copy constructor  Assigns an iterator  Table9.4. OperationsofForwardIterators   9.2 Iterator Categories  437  Unlike for input iterators, it is guaranteed that for two forward iterators that refer to the same element, operator == yields true and that they will refer to the same value after both are incremented. For example:  ForwardIterator pos1, pos2;  pos1 = pos2 = begin;    both iterators refer to the same element if  pos1 != end  {     pos1 is one element ahead  ++pos1; while  pos1 != end  {  if  *pos1 == *pos2  {     process adjacent duplicates  ... ++pos1; ++pos2;  }  }  Forward iterators are provided by the following objects and types:   Class     Unordered containers However, for unordered containers, libraries are allowed to provide bidirectional iterators instead  see Section 7.9.1, page 357 .  A forward iterator that fulﬁlls the requirements of an output iterator is a mutable forward iterator,  which can be used for both reading and writing.  9.2.4 Bidirectional Iterators  Bidirectional iterators are forward iterators that provide the additional ability to iterate backward over the elements. Thus, they provide the decrement operator to step backward  Table 9.5 .  Expression Effect --iter iter--  Steps backward  returns new position  Steps backward  returns old position   Table9.5. AdditionalOperationsofBidirectionalIterators  Bidirectional iterators are provided by the following objects and types:   Class list    Associative containers A bidirectional iterator that fulﬁlls the requirements of an output iterator is a mutable bidirectional iterator, which can be used for both reading and writing.   438  Chapter 9: STL Iterators  9.2.5 Random-Access Iterators  Random-access iterators provide all the abilities of bidirectional iterators plus random access. Thus, they provide operators for iterator arithmetic  in accordance with the pointer arithmetic of ordinary pointers . That is, they can add and subtract offsets, process differences, and compare iterators with relational operators, such as  . Table 9.6 lists the additional operations of random-access iterators.  Effect Provides access to the element that has index n Steps n elements forward  or backward, if n is negative  Steps n elements backward  or forward, if n is negative  Returns the iterator of the nth next element Returns the iterator of the nth next element Returns the iterator of the nth previous element Returns the distance between iter1 and iter2 Returns whether iter1 is before iter2 Returns whether iter1 is after iter2  Expression iter[n] iter+=n iter-=n iter+n n+iter iter-n iter1-iter2 iter1<iter2 iter1>iter2 iter1<=iter2 Returns whether iter1 is not after iter2 iter1>=iter2 Returns whether iter1 is not before iter2  Table9.6. AdditionalOperationsofRandom-AccessIterators  Random-access iterators are provided by the following objects and types:    Containers with random access  array, vector, deque    Strings  string, wstring    Ordinary C-style arrays  pointers  The following program shows the special abilities of random-access iterators:     iter itercategory1.cpp  include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {  vector  coll;     insert elements from -3 to 9 for  int i=-3; i<=9; ++i  {  coll.push_back  i ;  }   9.2 Iterator Categories  439     print number of elements by processing the distance between beginning and end    - NOTE: uses operator - for iterators cout << "number distance: " << coll.end  -coll.begin   << endl;     print all elements    - NOTE: uses operator < instead of operator != vector ::iterator pos; for  pos=coll.begin  ; pos<coll.end  ; ++pos  {  cout << *pos << ’ ’;  } cout << endl;     print all elements    - NOTE: uses operator [ ] instead of operator * for  int i=0; i<coll.size  ; ++i  { cout << coll.begin  [i] << ’ ’;  } cout << endl;     print every second element    - NOTE: uses operator += for  pos = coll.begin  ; pos < coll.end  -1; pos += 2  {  cout << *pos << ’ ’;  } cout << endl;  }  The output of the program is as follows:  number distance: 13 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 -3 -1 1 3 5 7  This example won’t work with  forward  lists,  unordered  sets, and  unordered  maps, because all operations marked with “NOTE:” are provided only for random-access iterators. In particular, keep in mind that you can use operator < as an end criterion in loops for random-access iterators only.  Note that in the last loop the following expression requires that coll contains at least one ele-  ment:  pos < coll.end  -1  If the collection was empty, coll.end  -1 would be the position before coll.begin  . The comparison might still work, but, strictly speaking, moving an iterator to before the beginning results in undeﬁned behavior. Similarly, the expression pos += 2 might result in undeﬁned behavior if it moves the iterator beyond the end   of the collection. Therefore, changing the ﬁnal loop to the   Chapter 9: STL Iterators  following is very dangerous because it results in undeﬁned behavior if the collection contains an odd number of elements  Figure 9.2 :  for  pos = coll.begin  ; pos < coll.end  ; pos += 2  {  cout << *pos << ’ ’;  440  }  Figure9.2. IncrementingIteratorsbyMorethanOneElement  A random-access iterator that fulﬁlls the requirements of an output iterator is a mutable random- access iterator, which can be used for both reading and writing.  9.2.6 The Increment and Decrement Problem of  Vector Iterators  The use of the increment and decrement operators of iterators includes a strange problem. In general, you can increment and decrement temporary iterators. However, for arrays, vectors, and strings, this might not compile on some platforms. Consider the following example:  std::vector  coll; ...    sort, starting with the second element    - NONPORTABLE version if  coll.size   > 1  {  std::sort ++coll.begin  , coll.end   ;  }  Depending on the platform, the compilation of ++coll.begin   might fail. However, if you use, for example, a deque rather than a vector, the compilation always succeeds.  The reason for this strange problem lies in the fact that iterators of vectors, arrays, and strings might be implemented as ordinary pointers. And for all fundamental data types, such as pointers, you are not allowed to modify temporary values. For structures and classes, however, doing so is allowed. Thus, if the iterator is implemented as an ordinary pointer, the compilation fails; if implemented as a class, it succeeds.   cid:7   cid:6   cid:5   cid:4   cid:3   cid:2   cid:8   cid:26   cid:20   cid:27   cid:16   cid:9   cid:13   cid:14   cid:20   cid:9   cid:28   cid:13   cid:14   cid:2   cid:3   cid:4   cid:5   cid:6   cid:7   cid:3   cid:5   cid:4   cid:8   cid:9   cid:10   cid:7   cid:11   cid:7   cid:9   cid:3   9.3 Auxiliary Iterator Functions  441  As a consequence, the preceding code always works with all containers except arrays, vectors, and strings, because you can’t implement iterators as ordinary pointers for them. But for arrays, vectors, and strings, whether the code works depends on the implementation. Often, ordinary point- ers are used. But if, for example, you use a “safe version” of the STL  as is more and more the case , the iterators are implemented as classes.  To make your code portable, the utility function next   is provided since C++11  see Sec-  tion 9.3.2, page 443 , so you can write:  std::vector  coll; ...    sort, starting with the second element    - PORTABLE version since C++11 if  coll.size   > 1  {  std::sort std::next coll.begin   , coll.end   ;  Before C++11, you had to use an auxiliary object instead:  std::vector  coll; ...    sort, starting with the second element    - PORTABLE version before C++11 if  coll.size   > 1  {  std::vector ::iterator beg = coll.begin  ; std::sort ++beg, coll.end   ;  }  }  The problem is not as bad as it sounds. You can’t get unexpected behavior, because the problem is detected at compile time. But it is tricky enough to spend time solving it.  9.3 Auxiliary Iterator Functions  The C++ standard library provides some auxiliary functions for dealing with iterators: advance  , next  , prev  , distance  , and iter_swap  . The ﬁrst four give all iterators some abilities usually provided only for random-access iterators: to step more than one element forward  or back- ward  and to process the difference between iterators. The last auxiliary function allows you to swap the values of two iterators.  9.3.1 advance    The function advance   increments the position of an iterator passed as the argument. Thus, the function lets the iterator step forward  or backward  more than one element:   442  Chapter 9: STL Iterators  include   void advance  InputIterator& pos, Dist n    Lets the input iterator pos step n elements forward  or backward .   For bidirectional and random-access iterators, n may be negative to step backward.   Dist is a template type. Normally, it must be an integral type because operations such as <, ++,   Note that advance   does not check whether it crosses the end   of a sequence  it can’t check because iterators in general do not know the containers on which they operate . Thus, calling this function might result in undeﬁned behavior because calling operator ++ for the end of a sequence is not deﬁned.  --, and comparisons with 0 are called.  Due to the use of iterator traits  see Section 9.5, page 466 , the function always uses the best imple- mentation, depending on the iterator category. For random-access iterators, it simply calls pos+=n. Thus, for such iterators, advance   has constant complexity. For all other iterators, it calls ++pos n times  or --pos if n is negative . Thus, for all other iterator categories, advance   has linear complexity.  To be able to change container and iterator types, you should use advance   rather than operator +=. In doing so, however, be aware that you risk unintended worse performance. The reason is that you don’t recognize that the performance is worsening when you use other containers that don’t provide random-access iterators  bad runtime is the reason why operator += is provided only for random-access iterators . Note also that advance   does not return anything. Operator += returns the new position, so it might be part of a larger expression. Here is an example of the use of advance  :     iter advance1.cpp  include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {  list  coll;     insert elements from 1 to 9 for  int i=1; i<=9; ++i  {  coll.push_back i ;  }  list ::iterator pos = coll.begin  ;   9.3 Auxiliary Iterator Functions  443     print actual element cout << *pos << endl;     step three elements forward advance  pos, 3 ;     print actual element cout << *pos << endl;     step one element backward advance  pos, -1 ;     print actual element cout << *pos << endl;  }  1 4 3  In this program, advance   lets the iterator pos step three elements forward and one element back- ward. Thus, the output is as follows:  Another way to use advance   is to ignore some input for iterators that read from an input stream. See the example in Section 9.4.3, page 465.  9.3.2 next   and prev    Since C++11, two additional helper functions allow you to move to following or previous iterator positions.  include   ForwardIterator next  ForwardIterator pos  ForwardIterator next  ForwardIterator pos, Dist n    Yields the position the forward iterator pos would have if moved forward 1 or n positions.   For bidirectional and random-access iterators, n may be negative to yield previous positions.   Dist is type std::iterator_traits ::difference_type.   Calls advance pos,n  for an internal temporary object.   Note that next   does not check whether it crosses the end   of a sequence. Thus, it is up to  the caller to ensure that the result is valid.   444  Chapter 9: STL Iterators  include   BidirectionalIterator prev  BidirectionalIterator pos  BidirectionalIterator prev  BidirectionalIterator pos, Dist n    Yields the position the bidirectional iterator pos would have if moved backward 1 or n positions.   n may be negative to yield following positions.   Dist is type. std::iterator_traits ::difference_type.   Calls advance pos,-n  for an internal temporary object.   Note that prev   does not check whether it crosses the begin   of a sequence. Thus, it is up to  the caller to ensure that the result is valid.  This allows, for example, running over a collection while checking values of the next element:  auto pos = coll.begin  ; while  pos != coll.end   && std::next pos  != coll.end    {  Doing so especially helps because forward and bidirectional iterators do not provide operators + and -. Otherwise, you always need a temporary:  auto pos = coll.begin  ; auto nextPos = pos; ++nextPos; while  pos != coll.end   && nextPos != coll.end    {  or have to restrict code to random-access iterators only:  auto pos = coll.begin  ; while  pos != coll.end   && pos+1 != coll.end    {  Don’t forget to ensure that there is a valid position before you use it  for this reason, we ﬁrst check whether pos is equal to coll.end   before we check the next position .  Another application of next   and prev   is to avoid expressions, such as ++coll.begin  , to deal with the second element of a collection. The problem is that using ++coll.begin   instead of std::next coll.begin    might not compile  see Section 9.2.6, page 440, for details .  A third application of next   is to work with forward_lists and before_begin    see Sec-  tion 7.6.2, page 307, for an example .  ... ++pos;  ... ++pos; ++nextPos;  ... ++pos;  }  }  }   9.3 Auxiliary Iterator Functions  9.3.3 distance    445  The distance   function is provided to process the difference between two iterators:  include   Dist distance  InputIterator pos1, InputIterator pos2    Returns the distance between the input iterators pos1 and pos2.   Both iterators have to refer to elements of the same container.   If the iterators are not random-access iterators, pos2 must be reachable from pos1; that is, it must   The return type, Dist, is the difference type according to the iterator type:  have the same position or a later position.  iterator_traits ::difference_type  See Section 9.5, page 466, for details.  By using iterator tags, this function uses the best implementation according to the iterator cate- gory. For random-access iterators, this function simply returns pos2-pos1. Thus, for such iterators, distance   has constant complexity. For all other iterator categories, pos1 is incremented until it reaches pos2 and the number of increments is returned. Thus, for all other iterator categories, distance   has linear complexity. Therefore, distance   has bad performance for other than random-access iterators. You should consider avoiding it.  The implementation of distance   is described in Section 9.5.1, page 470. The following  example demonstrates its use:     iter distance1.cpp  include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {  list  coll;     insert elements from -3 to 9 for  int i=-3; i<=9; ++i  {  coll.push_back i ;  }     search element with value 5 list ::iterator pos; pos = find  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  5 ;     range    value   446  Chapter 9: STL Iterators  if  pos != coll.end    {     process and print difference from the beginning cout << "difference between beginning and 5: "  << distance coll.begin  ,pos  << endl;  } else {  }  }  cout << "5 not found" << endl;  After find   assigns the position of the element with value 5 to pos, distance   uses this position to process the difference between this position and the beginning. The output of the program is as follows:  difference between beginning and 5: 8  To be able to change iterator and container types, you should use distance   instead of operator -. However, if you use distance  , you don’t recognize that the performance is getting worse when you switch from random-access iterators to other iterators.  To process the difference between two iterators that are not random-access iterators, you must be careful. The ﬁrst iterator must refer to an element that is not after the element of the second iterator. Otherwise, the behavior is undeﬁned. If you don’t know which iterator position comes ﬁrst, you have to process the distance between both iterators to the beginning of the container and process the difference of these distances. However, you must then know to which container the iterators refer. Otherwise, you have no chance of processing the difference of the two iterators without running into undeﬁned behavior. See the remarks about subranges in Section 6.4.1, page 205, for additional aspects of this problem.  9.3.4 iter_swap    This simple auxiliary function is provided to swap the values to which two iterators refer:  include   void iter_swap  ForwardIterator1 pos1, ForwardIterator2 pos2    Swaps the values to which iterators pos1 and pos2 refer.   The iterators don’t need to have the same type. However, the values must be assignable. Here is a simple example  function PRINT_ELEMENTS   is introduced in Section 6.6, page 216 :     iter iterswap1.cpp  include   include   include   include     9.3 Auxiliary Iterator Functions  447  include "print.hpp" using namespace std;  int main   {  list  coll;     insert elements from 1 to 9 for  int i=1; i<=9; ++i  {  coll.push_back i ;  }  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll ;     swap ﬁrst and second value iter_swap  coll.begin  , next coll.begin    ;  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll ;     swap ﬁrst and last value iter_swap  coll.begin  , prev coll.end    ;  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll ;  }  The output of the program is as follows:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 2 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 9 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 2  Note that next   and prev   are provided since C++11, and that using operators ++ and -- instead might not compile for each container:  vector  coll; ... iter_swap  coll.begin  , ++coll.begin   ; ... iter_swap  coll.begin  , --coll.end   ;  See Section 9.2.6, page 440, for details about this problem.     ERROR: might not compile     ERROR: might not compile   448  Chapter 9: STL Iterators  9.4 Iterator Adapters  This section covers iterator adapters provided by the C++ standard library. These special iterators allow algorithms to operate in reverse, in insert mode, and with streams.  9.4.1 Reverse Iterators  Reverse iterators redeﬁne increment and decrement operators so that they behave in reverse. Thus, if you use these iterators instead of ordinary iterators, algorithms process elements in reverse order. Most container classes — all except forward lists and unordered containers — as well as strings provide the ability to use reverse iterators to iterate over their elements. Consider the following example:     iter reviter1.cpp  include   include   include   using namespace std;  void print  int elem  {  cout << elem << ’ ’;  int main   {  }  }     create list with elements from 1 to 9 list  coll = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 };     print all elements in normal order for_each  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  print ;  cout << endl;     print all elements in reverse order for_each  coll.rbegin  , coll.rend  ,  print ;  cout << endl;     range    operation     range    operations  The rbegin   and rend   member functions return a reverse iterator. According to begin   and end  , these iterators deﬁne the elements to process as a half-open range. However, they operate in a reverse direction:   9.4 Iterator Adapters  449    rbegin   returns the position of the ﬁrst element of a reverse iteration. Thus, it returns the   rend   returns the position after the last element of a reverse iteration. Thus, it returns the  position of the last element.  position before the ﬁrst element.  Thus, the output of the program is as follows:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1  Since C++11, corresponding crbegin   and crend   member functions are provided, which return read-only reverse iterators. Because we only read the elements, they could  and should  be used in this example:     print all elements in reverse order for_each  coll.crbegin  , coll.crend  ,  print ;     range    operations  Iterators and Reverse Iterators  You can convert normal iterators into reverse iterators. Naturally, the iterators must be bidirectional iterators, but note that the logical position of an iterator is moved during the conversion. Consider the following program:     iter reviter2.cpp  include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {     create list with elements from 1 to 9 vector  coll = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 };     ﬁnd position of element with value 5 vector ::const_iterator pos; pos = find  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  5 ;     print value to which iterator pos refers cout << "pos:  " << *pos << endl;     convert iterator to reverse iterator rpos vector ::const_reverse_iterator rpos pos ;   Chapter 9: STL Iterators  450  }     print value to which reverse iterator rpos refers cout << "rpos: " << *rpos << endl;  This program has the following output:  pos: 5 rpos: 4  Thus, if you print the value of an iterator and convert the iterator into a reverse iterator, the value has changed. This is not a bug; it’s a feature! This behavior is a consequence of the fact that ranges are half open. To specify all elements of a container, you must use the position after the last argument. However, for a reverse iterator, this is the position before the ﬁrst element. Unfortunately, such a position may not exist. Containers are not required to guarantee that the position before their ﬁrst element is valid. Consider that ordinary strings and arrays might also be containers, and the language does not guarantee that arrays don’t start at address zero.  As a result, the designers of reverse iterators use a trick: They “physically” reverse the “half-open principle.” Physically, in a range deﬁned by reverse iterators, the beginning is not included, whereas the end is. However, logically, they behave as usual. Thus, there is a distinction between the physical position that deﬁnes the element to which the iterator refers and the logical position that deﬁnes the value to which the iterator refers  Figure 9.3 . The question is, what happens on a conversion from an iterator to a reverse iterator? Does the iterator keep its logical position  the value  or its physical position  the element ? As the previous example shows, the latter is the case. Thus, the value is moved to the previous element  Figure 9.4 .  Figure9.3. PositionandValueofReverseIterators  You can’t understand this decision? Well, it has its advantages: You have nothing to do when you convert a range that is speciﬁed by two iterators rather than a single iterator. All elements remain valid. Consider the following example:     iter reviter3.cpp  include   include   include     cid:9   cid:10   cid:11   cid:12   cid:13   cid:7   cid:20   cid:9   cid:28   cid:13   cid:14   cid:7   cid:26   cid:20   cid:27   cid:16   cid:9   cid:13   cid:14   cid:9   cid:10   cid:11   cid:12   cid:13   9.4 Iterator Adapters  451  Figure9.4. ConversionbetweenIterator pos andReverseIterator rpos  include   using namespace std;  void print  int elem  {  cout << elem << ’ ’;  }  int main   {     create deque with elements from 1 to 9 deque  coll = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 };     ﬁnd position of element with value 2 deque ::const_iterator pos1; pos1 = find  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,     ﬁnd position of element with value 7 deque ::const_iterator pos2; pos2 = find  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  2 ;  7 ;     range    value     range    value     print all elements in range [pos1,pos2     range for_each  pos1, pos2,    operation  print ;  cout << endl;   cid:7   cid:29   cid:3   cid:10   cid:9   cid:10   cid:11   cid:12   cid:13   cid:7   cid:6   cid:5   cid:4   cid:3   cid:2   cid:8   cid:14   cid:15   cid:29   cid:3   cid:10   Chapter 9: STL Iterators  452  }     convert iterators to reverse iterators deque ::const_reverse_iterator rpos1 pos1 ; deque ::const_reverse_iterator rpos2 pos2 ;     print all elements in range [pos1,pos2  in reverse order for_each  rpos2, rpos1,     range    operation  print ;  cout << endl;  The iterators pos1 and pos2 specify the half-open range, including the element with value 2 but excluding the element with value 7. When the iterators describing that range are converted into reverse iterators, the range remains valid and can be processed in reverse order. Thus, the output of the program is as follows:  Of course, constant iterators are converted into type const_reverse_iterator.  Converting Reverse Iterators Back Using base    You can convert reverse iterators back into normal iterators. To do this, reverse iterators provide the base   member function:  2 3 4 5 6 6 5 4 3 2  Thus, rbegin   is simply:  container::reverse_iterator end     and rend   is simply:  container::reverse_iterator begin     namespace std {  template   class reverse_iterator ... {  ... Iterator base   const; ...  };  }  Here is an example of the use of base  :     iter reviter4.cpp  include   include     9.4 Iterator Adapters  453  include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {     create list with elements from 1 to 9 list  coll = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 };     ﬁnd position of element with value 5 list ::const_iterator pos; pos = find  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  5 ;     range    value     print value of the element cout << "pos:  " << *pos << endl;     convert iterator to reverse iterator list ::const_reverse_iterator rpos pos ;     print value of the element to which the reverse iterator refers cout << "rpos:  " << *rpos << endl;     convert reverse iterator back to normal iterator list ::const_iterator rrpos; rrpos = rpos.base  ;     print value of the element to which the normal iterator refers cout << "rrpos: " << *rrpos << endl;  The program has the following output:  }  5 pos: rpos: 4 rrpos: 5  Thus, the conversion with base    *rpos.base    is equivalent to the conversion in a reverse iterator. That is, the physical position  the element of the iterator  is retained, but the logical position  the value of the element  is moved. See Section 11.5.3, page 539. for another example of the use of base  .   454  Chapter 9: STL Iterators  9.4.2 Insert Iterators  Insert iterators, also called inserters, are iterator adapters that transform an assignment of a new value into an insertion of that new value. By using insert iterators, algorithms can insert rather than overwrite. All insert iterators are in the output-iterator category. Thus, they provide only the ability to assign new values  see Section 9.2.1, page 433 .  Functionality of Insert Iterators  Usually, an algorithm assigns values to a destination iterator. For example, consider the copy   algorithm  described in Section 11.6.1, page 557 :  namespace std {  template   OutputIterator copy  InputIterator from_pos, InputIterator from_end, OutputIterator to_pos      beginning of source    end of source    beginning of dest.  {  }  }  while  from_pos != from_end  {  *to_pos = *from_pos; ++from_pos; ++to_pos;     copy values    increment iterators  } return to_pos;  The loop runs until the actual position of the source iterator has reached the end. Inside the loop, the source iterator, from_pos, is assigned to the destination iterator, to_pos, and both iterators get incremented.  The interesting part is the assignment of the new value: *to_pos = value  An insert iterator transforms such an assignment into an insertion. However, two operations are involved: First, operator * returns the current element of the iterator; second, operator = assigns the new value. Implementations of insert iterators usually use the following two-step trick: 1. Operator * is implemented as a no-op that simply returns *this. Thus, for insert iterators, *pos  is equivalent to pos.  2. The assignment operator is implemented so that it gets transferred into an insertion. In fact, the insert iterator calls the push_back  , push_front  , or insert   member function of the container.  Thus, for insert iterators, you could write pos=value instead of *pos=value to insert a new value. However, I’m talking about implementation details of input iterators. The correct expression to assign a new value is *pos=value.  Similarly, the increment operator is implemented as a no-op that simply returns *this. Thus,  you can’t modify the position of an insert iterator. Table 9.7 lists all operations of insert iterators.   9.4 Iterator Adapters  455  Expression *iter iter = value ++iter iter++  Effect No-op  returns iter  Inserts value No-op  returns iter  No-op  returns iter   Table9.7. OperationsofInsertIterators  Kinds of Insert Iterators  The C++ standard library provides three kinds of insert iterators: back inserters, front inserters, and general inserters. They differ in their handling of the position at which to insert a value. In fact, each uses a different member function, which it calls for the container to which it belongs. Thus, an insert iterator must be always initialized with its container.  Each kind of insert iterator has a convenience function for its creation and initialization. Table 9.8  lists the kinds of insert iterators and their abilities.  Name Back inserter Front inserter General inserter  Class back_insert_iterator front_insert_iterator insert_iterator  Called Function push_back value  push_front value  insert pos,value   Creation back_inserter cont  front_inserter cont  inserter cont,pos   Table9.8. KindsofInsertIterators  Of course, the container must provide the member function that the insert iterator calls; other- wise, that kind of insert iterator can’t be used. For this reason, back inserters are available only for vectors, deques, lists, and strings; front inserters are available only for deques and lists.  Back Inserters  A back inserter, or back insert iterator, appends a value at the end of a container by calling the push_back   member function  see Section 8.7.1, page 415, for details about push_back   . push_back   is available only for vectors, deques, lists, and strings, so these are the only con- tainers in the C++ standard library for which back inserters are usable.  A back inserter must be initialized with its container at creation time. The back_inserter   function provides a convenient way of doing this. The following example demonstrates the use of back inserters:     iter backinserter1.cpp  include   include   include   include "print.hpp" using namespace std;   456  Chapter 9: STL Iterators  int main   {  vector  coll;     create back inserter for coll    - inconvenient way back_insert_iterator  > iter coll ;     insert elements with the usual iterator interface *iter = 1; iter++; *iter = 2; iter++; *iter = 3; PRINT_ELEMENTS coll ;     create back inserter and insert elements    - convenient way back_inserter coll  = 44; back_inserter coll  = 55; PRINT_ELEMENTS coll ;     use back inserter to append all elements again    - reserve enough memory to avoid reallocation coll.reserve 2*coll.size   ; copy  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  back_inserter coll  ;  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll ;     source    destination  }  The output of the program is as follows:  1 2 3 1 2 3 44 55 1 2 3 44 55 1 2 3 44 55  Note that you must not forget to reserve enough space before calling copy  . The reason is that the back inserter inserts elements, which might invalidate all other iterators referring to the same vector. Thus, if not enough space is reserved, the algorithm invalidates the passed source iterators while running.  Strings also provide an STL container interface, including push_back  . Therefore, you could  use back inserters to append characters in a string. See Section 13.2.14, page 688, for an example.   9.4 Iterator Adapters  Front Inserters  457  A front inserter, or front insert iterator, inserts a value at the beginning of a container by calling the push_front   member function  see Section 8.7.1, page 414, for details about push_front   . push_front   is available only for deques, lists, and forward lists, so these are the only containers in the C++ standard library for which front inserters are usable.  A front inserter must be initialized with its container at creation time. The front_inserter   function provides a convenient way of doing this. The following example demonstrates the use of front inserters:     iter frontinserter1.cpp  include   include   include   include "print.hpp" using namespace std;  int main   {  list  coll;     create front inserter for coll    - inconvenient way front_insert_iterator  > iter coll ;     insert elements with the usual iterator interface *iter = 1; iter++; *iter = 2; iter++; *iter = 3;  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll ;     create front inserter and insert elements    - convenient way front_inserter coll  = 44; front_inserter coll  = 55;  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll ;   458  Chapter 9: STL Iterators     use front inserter to insert all elements again copy  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  front_inserter coll  ;     source    destination  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll ;  }  The output of the program is as follows:  3 2 1 55 44 3 2 1 1 2 3 44 55 55 44 3 2 1  Note that the front inserter inserts multiple elements in reverse order. This happens because it always inserts the next element in front of the previous one.  General Inserters  A general inserter, or general insert iterator,1 is initialized with two values: the container and the position that is used for the insertions. Using both, a general inserter calls the insert   member function with the speciﬁed position as argument. The inserter   function provides a convenient way of creating and initializing a general inserter.  A general inserter is available for all standard containers except arrays and forward lists, because these containers provide the needed insert   member function  see Section 8.7.1, page 413 . How- ever, for associative and unordered containers, the position is used only as a hint, because the value of the element deﬁnes the correct position. See Section 8.7.1, page 413, for details.  After an insertion, the general inserter gets the position of the new inserted element. In particular,  the following statements are called:  pos = container.insert pos,value ; ++pos;  The assignment of the return value of insert   ensures that the iterator’s position is always valid. Without the assignment of the new position for deques, vectors, and strings, the general inserter would invalidate itself. The reason is that each insertion does, or at least might, invalidate all iterators that refer to the container.  The following example demonstrates the use of general inserters:     iter inserter1.cpp  include   include    1 A general inserter is often simply called an insert iterator, or inserter. This means that the words insert iterator and inserter have different meanings: They are a general term for all kinds of insert iterators and are also used as names for a special insert iterator that inserts at a speciﬁed position rather than in the front or in the back. To avoid this ambiguity, I use the term general inserter in this book.   9.4 Iterator Adapters  459  include   include   include "print.hpp" using namespace std;  int main   {  set  coll;     create insert iterator for coll    - inconvenient way insert_iterator  > iter coll,coll.begin   ;     insert elements with the usual iterator interface *iter = 1; iter++; *iter = 2; iter++; *iter = 3;  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll,"set:  " ;     create inserter and insert elements    - convenient way inserter coll,coll.end    = 44; inserter coll,coll.end    = 55;  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll,"set:  " ;     use inserter to insert all elements into a list list  coll2; copy  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  inserter coll2,coll2.begin    ;     source    destination  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll2,"list: " ;     use inserter to reinsert all elements into the list before the second element copy  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  inserter coll2,++coll2.begin    ;     source    destination  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll2,"list: " ;  }   460  Chapter 9: STL Iterators  The output of the program is as follows:  1 2 3 set: set: 1 2 3 44 55 list: 1 2 3 44 55 list: 1 1 2 3 44 55 2 3 44 55  The calls of copy   demonstrate that the general inserter maintains the order of the elements. The second call of copy   uses a certain position inside the range that is passed as argument.  A User-Deﬁned Inserter for Associative Containers  As mentioned previously, for associative containers, the position argument of general inserters is used only as a hint. This hint might help to improve speed but also might cause bad performance. For example, if the inserted elements are in reverse order, the hint may slow down programs a bit because the search for the correct insertion point always starts at a wrong position. Thus, a bad hint might even be worse than no hint. This is a good example of the need for supplementation of the C++ standard library. See Section 9.6, page 471, for such an extension.  9.4.3 Stream Iterators  A stream iterator is an iterator adapter that allows you to use a stream as a source or destination of algorithms. In particular, an istream iterator can be used to read elements from an input stream, and an ostream iterator can be used to write values to an output stream.  A special form of a stream iterator is a stream buffer iterator, which can be used to read from or write to a stream buffer directly. Stream buffer iterators are discussed in Section 15.13.2, page 828.  Ostream Iterators  Ostream iterators write assigned values to an output stream. By using ostream iterators, algorithms can write directly to streams. The implementation of an ostream iterator uses the same concept as the implementation of insert iterators  see Section 9.4.2, page 454 . The only difference is that they transform the assignment of a new value into an output operation by using operator <<. Thus, algorithms can write directly to streams by using the usual iterator interface. Table 9.9 lists the operations of ostream iterators.  When the ostream iterator is created, you must pass the output stream on which the values are written. An optional string can be passed, written as a separator between single values. Without the delimiter, the elements directly follow each other.  Ostream iterators are deﬁned for a certain element type T: namespace std {  template <typename T,  typename charT = char, typename traits = char_traits  >  class ostream_iterator;  }   9.4 Iterator Adapters  461  Effect Creates an ostream iterator for ostream  Expression ostream_iterator  ostream  ostream_iterator  ostream,delim  Creates an ostream iterator for ostream, with the string delim as the delimiter between the values  note that delim has type const char*  No-op  returns iter  Writes value to ostream: ostream<<value  followed by delim, if set  No-op  returns iter  No-op  returns iter   *iter iter = value  ++iter iter++  Table9.9. OperationsofostreamIterators  The optional second and third template arguments specify the type of stream that is used  see Sec- tion 15.2.1, page 749, for their meaning .2  The following example demonstrates the use of ostream iterators:     iter ostreamiter1.cpp  include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {     create ostream iterator for stream cout    - values are separated by a newline character ostream_iterator  intWriter cout,"\n" ;     write elements with the usual iterator interface *intWriter = 42; intWriter++; *intWriter = 77; intWriter++; *intWriter = -5;     create collection with elements from 1 to 9 vector  coll = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 };  2 In older systems, the optional template arguments for the stream type are missing.   462  Chapter 9: STL Iterators     write all elements without any delimiter copy  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  ostream_iterator  cout  ;  cout << endl;     write all elements with " < " as delimiter copy  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  ostream_iterator  cout," < "  ;  cout << endl;  }  The output of the program is as follows:  42 77 -5 123456789 1 < 2 < 3 < 4 < 5 < 6 < 7 < 8 < 9 <  string delim; ... ostream_iterator  cout,delim.c_str   ;  Istream Iterators  Note that the delimiter has type const char*. Thus, if you pass an object of type string, you must call its member function c_str    see Section 13.3.6, page 700  to get the correct type. For example:  Istream iterators are the counterparts of ostream iterators. An istream iterator reads elements from an input stream. By using istream iterators, algorithms can read from streams directly. However, istream iterators are a bit more complicated than ostream iterators  as usual, reading is more com- plicated than writing .  At creation time, the istream iterator is initialized by the input stream from which it reads. Then, by using the usual interface of input iterators  see Section 9.2.2, page 435 , the istream iterator reads element-by-element, using operator >>. However, reading might fail  due to end-of-ﬁle or an error , and source ranges of algorithms need an “end position.” To handle both problems, you can use an end-of-stream iterator, which is created with the default constructor for istream iterators. If a read fails, every istream iterator becomes an end-of-stream iterator. Thus, after any read access, you should compare an istream iterator with an end-of-stream iterator to check whether the iterator has a valid value. Table 9.10 lists all operations of istream iterators.   9.4 Iterator Adapters  463  Expression istream_iterator    istream_iterator  istream  Creates an istream iterator for istream  and might read the  Effect Creates an end-of-stream iterator  *iter  iter->member ++iter iter++  iter1== iter2 iter1!= iter2  ﬁrst value  Returns the value, read before  reads ﬁrst value if not done by the constructor  Returns a member, if any, of the actual value, read before Reads next value and returns its position Reads next value but returns an iterator for the previous value Tests iter1 and iter2 for equality Tests iter1 and iter2 for inequality  Table9.10. OperationsofistreamIterators  Note that the constructor of an istream iterator opens the stream and usually reads the ﬁrst element. Otherwise, it could not return the ﬁrst element when operator * is called after the initialization. However, implementations may defer the ﬁrst read until the ﬁrst call of operator *. So, you should not deﬁne an istream iterator before you need it.  Istream iterators are deﬁned for a certain element type T: namespace std {  template <typename T,  typename charT = char, typename traits = char_traits , typename Distance = ptrdiff_t>  class istream_iterator;  }  The optional second and third template arguments specify the type of stream that is used  see Sec- tion 15.2.1, page 749, for their meaning . The optional fourth template argument speciﬁes the dif- ference type for the iterators.3   both are end-of-stream iterators and thus can no longer read, or   both can read and use the same stream.  Two istream iterators are equal if  3 In older systems without default template parameters, the optional fourth template argument is required as the second argument, and the arguments for the stream type are missing.   464  Chapter 9: STL Iterators  The following example demonstrates the operations provided for istream iterators:     iter istreamiter1.cpp  include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {     create istream iterator that reads integers from cin istream_iterator  intReader cin ;     create end-of-stream iterator istream_iterator  intReaderEOF;     while able to read tokens with istream iterator    - write them twice while  intReader != intReaderEOF  {  cout << "once: " << *intReader << endl; cout << "once again: " << *intReader << endl; ++intReader;  If you start the program with the following input:  the output of the program is as follows:  }  }  1 2 3 f 4  once: 1 once again: 1 once: 2 once again: 2 once: 3 once again: 3  As you can see, the input of character f ends the program. Due to a format error, the stream is no longer in a good state. Therefore, the istream iterator intReader is equal to the end-of-stream iterator intReaderEOF. So, the condition of the loop yields false.   9.4 Iterator Adapters  465  Example of Stream Iterators and advance    The following example uses both kinds of stream iterators and the advance   helper function:     iter advance2.cpp  include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {  istream_iterator  cinPos cin ; ostream_iterator  coutPos cout," " ;     while input is not at the end of the ﬁle    - write every third string while  cinPos != istream_iterator     {     ignore the following two strings advance  cinPos, 2 ;     read and write the third string if  cinPos != istream_iterator     {  *coutPos++ = *cinPos++;  }  } cout << endl;  }  The advance   iterator function is provided to advance the iterator to another position  see Sec- tion 9.3.1, page 441 . Used with istream iterators, advance   skips input tokens. For example, if you have the following input:4  No one objects if you are doing a good programming job for someone whom you respect.  the output is as follows:  objects are good for you  4 Thanks to Andrew Koenig for the nice input of this example.   466  Chapter 9: STL Iterators  Don’t forget to check whether the istream iterator is still valid after calling advance   and be- fore accessing its value with *cinPos. Calling operator * for an end-of-stream iterator results in undeﬁned behavior.  For other examples that demonstrate how algorithms use stream iterators to read from and write  to streams, see Section 6.5.2, page 212; Section 11.6.1, page 560; and Section 11.7.2, page 582.  9.4.4 Move Iterators  Since C++11, an iterator adapter is provided that converts any access to the underlying element into a move operation. For example:  std::list  s; ... std::vector  v1 s.begin  , s.end   ;     copy strings into v1  std::vector  v2 make_move_iterator s.begin   ,     move strings into v2  make_move_iterator s.end    ;  One application of these iterators is to let algorithms move instead of copy elements from one range into another. However, note that in general, the move   algorithm also does that  see Section 11.6.2, page 561 .  In general, using a move iterator in algorithms only makes sense when the algorithm transfers elements of a source range to a destination range. In addition, you have to ensure that each element is accessed only once. Otherwise, the contents would be moved more than once, which would result in undeﬁned behavior.  Note that the only iterator category that guarantees that elements are read or processed only once is the input iterator category  see Section 9.2.2, page 435 . Thus, using move iterators usually makes sense only when an algorithm has a source where the input iterator category is required and a destination that uses the output iterator category. The only exception is for_each  , which can be used to process the moved elements of the passed range  for example, to move them into a new container .  9.5 Iterator Traits  The various iterator categories  see Section 9.2, page 433  represent special iterator abilities. It might be useful or even necessary to be able to overload behavior for different iterator categories. By using iterator tags and iterator traits  both provided in   , such an overloading can be performed.  For each iterator category, the C++ standard library provides an iterator tag that can be used as a  “label” for iterators:   467  9.5 Iterator Traits  namespace std {  struct output_iterator_tag { }; struct input_iterator_tag { }; struct forward_iterator_tag  : public input_iterator_tag {  }; struct bidirectional_iterator_tag : public forward_iterator_tag {  }; struct random_access_iterator_tag  : public bidirectional_iterator_tag {  };  }  };  }  Note that inheritance is used. So, for example, any forward iterator is a kind of input iterator. However, note that the tag for forward iterators is derived only from the tag for input iterators, not from the tag for output iterators. Thus, any forward iterator is not a kind of output iterator. Only a mutable forward iterator also fulﬁlls the requirements of output iterators  see Section 9.2, page 433 , but no speciﬁc category exists for this.  If you write generic code, you might not be interested only in the iterator category. For example, you may need the type of the elements to which the iterator refers. Therefore, the C++ standard library provides a special template structure to deﬁne the iterator traits. This structure contains all relevant information about an iterator and is used as a common interface for all the type deﬁnitions an iterator should have  the category, the type of the elements, and so on :  namespace std {  template   struct iterator_traits {  typedef typename T::iterator_category iterator_category; typedef typename T::value_type typedef typename T::difference_type typedef typename T::pointer typedef typename T::reference  value_type; difference_type; pointer; reference;  In this template, T stands for the type of the iterator. Thus, you can write code that, for any iterator, uses its category, the type of its elements, and so on. For example, the following expression yields the value type of iterator type T:  typename std::iterator_traits ::value_type  This structure has two advantages: 1. 2. The latter is done for ordinary pointers that also can be used as iterators:  It ensures that an iterator provides all type deﬁnitions. It can be  partially  specialized for  sets of  special iterators.   468  Chapter 9: STL Iterators  namespace std {  template   struct iterator_traits  {  typedef T typedef ptrdiff_t typedef random_access_iterator_tag iterator_category; typedef T* typedef T&  value_type; difference_type;  pointer; reference;  };  }  Thus, for any type “pointer to T,” it is deﬁned as having the random-access iterator category. A corresponding partial specialization exists for constant pointers  const T* .  Note that output iterators can be used only to write something. Thus, in the case of an output  iterator, value_type, difference_type, pointer, and reference may be deﬁned as void.  9.5.1 Writing Generic Functions for Iterators  Using iterator traits, you can write generic functions that derive type deﬁnitions or use different implementation code depending on the iterator category.  Using Iterator Types  A simple example of the use of iterator traits is an algorithm that needs a temporary variable for the elements. Such a temporary value is declared simply like this:  typename std::iterator_traits ::value_type tmp;  where T is the type of the iterator.  Another example is an algorithm that shifts elements cyclically: template   void shift_left  ForwardIterator beg, ForwardIterator end  {     temporary variable for ﬁrst element typedef typename  std::iterator_traits ::value_type value_type;  if  beg != end  {     save value of ﬁrst element value_type tmp *beg ;     shift following values ...  }  }   9.5 Iterator Traits  Using Iterator Categories  469  To use different implementations for different iterator categories you must follow these two steps: 1. Let your function template call another function with the iterator category as an additional argu-  ment. For example:  template   inline void foo  Iterator beg, Iterator end  {  foo  beg, end,  std::iterator_traits ::iterator_category   ;  2.  Implement that other function for any iterator category that provides a special implementation that is not derived from another iterator category. For example:     foo   for bidirectional iterators template   void foo  BiIterator beg, BiIterator end, std::bidirectional_iterator_tag      foo   for random-access iterators template   void foo  RaIterator beg, RaIterator end, std::random_access_iterator_tag   } The version for random-access iterators could, for example, use random-access operations, whereas the version for bidirectional iterators would not. Due to the hierarchy of iterator tags  see Section 9.5, page 466 , you could provide one implementation for more than one iterator category.  Implementation of distance    An example of following those two steps is the implementation of the auxiliary distance   it- erator function, which returns the distance between two iterator positions and their elements  see Section 9.3.3, page 445 . The implementation for random-access iterators uses only the operator -. For all other iterator categories, the number of increments to reach the end of the range is returned:  }  {  }  {  ...  ...   470  Chapter 9: STL Iterators     general distance   template   typename std::iterator_traits ::difference_type distance  Iterator pos1, Iterator pos2  {  return distance  pos1, pos2,  std::iterator_traits   ::iterator_category   ;     distance   for random-access iterators template   typename std::iterator_traits ::difference_type distance  RaIterator pos1, RaIterator pos2,  std::random_access_iterator_tag   return pos2 - pos1;     distance   for input, forward, and bidirectional iterators template   typename std::iterator_traits ::difference_type distance  InIterator pos1, InIterator pos2,  std::input_iterator_tag   typename std::iterator_traits ::difference_type d; for  d=0; pos1 != pos2; ++pos1, ++d  {  ;  } return d;  }  {  }  {  }  The difference type of the iterator is used as the return type. Note that the second version uses the tag for input iterators, so this implementation is also used by forward and bidirectional iterators because their tags are derived from input_iterator_tag.   9.6 Writing User-Deﬁned Iterators  471  9.6 Writing User-Deﬁned Iterators  Let’s write an iterator. As mentioned in the previous section, you need iterator traits provided for the user-deﬁned iterator. You can provide them in one of two ways: 1. Provide the necessary ﬁve type deﬁnitions for the general iterator_traits structure  see Sec-  tion 9.5, page 467 .  2. Provide a  partial  specialization of the iterator_traits structure. For the ﬁrst way, the C++ standard library provides a special base class, iterator , that does the type deﬁnitions. You need only pass the types:  class MyIterator  : public std::iterator <std::bidirectional_iterator_tag,  type, std::ptrdiff_t, type*, type&> {  The ﬁrst template parameter deﬁnes the iterator category, the second deﬁnes the element type type, the third deﬁnes the difference type, the fourth deﬁnes the pointer type, and the ﬁfth deﬁnes the reference type. The last three arguments are optional and have the default values ptrdiff_t, type*, and type&. Thus, often it is enough to use the following deﬁnition:  class MyIterator : public std::iterator   {  ...  };  ...  };  The following example demonstrates how to write a user-deﬁned iterator. It is an insert iterator for associative and unordered containers. Unlike insert iterators of the C++ standard library  see Section 9.4.2, page 454 , no insert position is used. Here is the implementation of the iterator class:     iter assoiter.hpp  include       class template for insert iterator for associative and unordered containers template   class asso_insert_iterator  : public std::iterator <std::output_iterator_tag,  typename Container::value_type>  {  protected:  public:  Container& container;     container in which elements are inserted     constructor explicit asso_insert_iterator  Container& c  : container c  { }   }  }  }  };  }  472  Chapter 9: STL Iterators     assignment operator    - inserts a value into the container asso_insert_iterator & operator=  const typename Container::value_type& value  {  container.insert value ; return *this;     dereferencing is a no-op that returns the iterator itself asso_insert_iterator & operator*    {  return *this;     increment operation is a no-op that returns the iterator itself asso_insert_iterator & operator++    {  } asso_insert_iterator & operator++  int  {  return *this;  return *this;     convenience function to create the inserter template   inline asso_insert_iterator  asso_inserter  Container& c  {  return asso_insert_iterator  c ;  The asso_insert_iterator class is derived from the iterator class, where corresponding types are deﬁned. The ﬁrst template argument passed is output_iterator_tag to specify the itera- tor category. The second argument is the type of the values the iterator refers to, which is the value_type of the container. Because output iterators can be used only to write something, this type deﬁnition is not necessary, so you can pass void here. However, passing the value type as demonstrated here works for any iterator category.  At creation time the iterator stores its container in its container member. Any value that gets assigned is inserted into the container by insert  . Operators * and ++ are no-ops that simply return the iterator itself. Thus, the iterator maintains control. If the usual iterator interface  *pos = value  is used, the *pos expression returns *this, to which the new value is assigned. That assignment is transferred into a call of insert value  for the container.   9.6 Writing User-Deﬁned Iterators  473  After the deﬁnition of the inserter class, the usual convenient function asso_inserter is deﬁned as a convenience function to create and initialize an inserter. The following program uses such an inserter to insert some elements into an unordered set:     iter assoiter1.cpp  include   include   include   include   include "print.hpp" include "assoiter.hpp"  int main   {  std::unordered_set  coll;     create inserter for coll    - inconvenient way asso_insert_iterator  iter coll ;     insert elements with the usual iterator interface *iter = 1; iter++; *iter = 2; iter++; *iter = 3;  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll ;     create inserter for coll and insert elements    - convenient way asso_inserter coll  = 44; asso_inserter coll  = 55;  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll ;     use inserter with an algorithm std::vector  vals = { 33, 67, -4, 13, 5, 2 }; std::copy  vals.begin  , vals.end  ,  asso_inserter coll  ;     source    destination  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll ;  }   474  Chapter 9: STL Iterators  The normal application of the asso_inserter demonstrates the copy   call:  std::copy  vals.begin  , vals.end  ,  asso_inserter coll  ;     source    destination  Here, asso_inserter coll  creates an inserter that inserts any argument passed into coll, calling coll.insert val .  The other statements demonstrate the behavior of the inserter in detail. The output of the program  is as follows:  1 2 3 55 44 1 2 3 -4 33 55 44 67 1 13 2 3 5  if you replace Note that this iterator could also be used by associative containers. unordered_set by set in both the include directive and the declaration of coll, the program would still work  although the elements in the container would be sorted then .  Thus,   Chapter 10 STL Function Objects and Using Lambdas  This chapter discusses in detail the features to pass speciﬁc functionality to algorithms and member functions, function objects, or functors for short  introduced in Section 6.10, page 233 . It covers the full set of predeﬁned function objects and function adapters and binders and the concept of func- tional composition, provides examples of self-written function objects, and presents details about the application of lambdas  introduced in Section 3.1.10, page 28, and Section 6.9, page 229 .  As a consequence, you will learn details and surprising behavior of the algorithms remove_if    and for_each  .  10.1 The Concept of Function Objects  A function object, or functor, is an object that has operator    deﬁned so that in the following example  the expression fo   is a call of operator    for the function object fo instead of a call of the function fo  . At ﬁrst, you could consider a function object as an ordinary function that is written in a more complicated way. Instead of writing all the function statements inside the function body:  FunctionObjectType fo; ... fo ... ;  void fo   {  statements  }  you write them inside the body of operator    of the function object class:   476  Chapter 10: STL Function Objects and Using Lambdas  class FunctionObjectType {  public:  void operator      {  statements  }  };  This kind of deﬁnition is more complicated but has three important advantages: 1. A function object might be smarter because it may have a state  associated members that in- ﬂuence the behavior of the function object . In fact, you can have two instances of the same function object class, which may have different states at the same time. This is not possible for ordinary functions.  2. Each function object has its own type. Thus, you can pass the type of a function object to a template to specify a certain behavior, and you have the advantage that container types with different function objects differ.  3. A function object is usually faster than a function pointer. See Section 6.10.1, page 235, for more details about these advantages and an example that shows how function objects can be smarter than ordinary functions.  In the next two subsections, I present two other examples that go into more detail about func- tion objects. The ﬁrst example demonstrates how to beneﬁt from the fact that each function object usually has its own type. The second example demonstrates how to beneﬁt from the state of func- tion objects and leads to an interesting property of the for_each   algorithm, which is covered in Section 10.1.3, page 482.  10.1.1 Function Objects as Sorting Criteria  Programmers often need a sorted collection of elements that have a special class  for example, a collection of Persons . However, you either don’t want to or can’t use the usual operator < to sort the objects. Instead, you sort the objects according to a special sorting criterion based on some member function. In this regard, a function object can help. Consider the following example:     fo sort1.cpp  include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  class Person {  public:  string firstname   const; string lastname   const; ...  };   10.1 The Concept of Function Objects  477     class for function predicate    - operator    returns whether a person is less than another person class PersonSortCriterion {  public:  bool operator    const Person& p1, const Person& p2  const {     a person is less than another person    - if the last name is less    - if the last name is equal and the ﬁrst name is less return p1.lastname  <p2.lastname      p1.lastname  ==p2.lastname   && p1.firstname  <p2.firstname   ;  }  };  int main   {  ...  } ...  }     create a set with special sorting criterion set  coll; ...     do something with the elements for  auto pos = coll.begin  ; pos != coll.end  ; ++pos  {  The set coll uses the special sorting criterion PersonSortCriterion, which is deﬁned as a func- tion object class. PersonSortCriterion deﬁnes operator    in such a way that it compares two Persons according to their last names and, if they are equal, to their ﬁrst names. The constructor of coll creates an instance of class PersonSortCriterion automatically so that the elements are sorted according to this sorting criterion.  Note that the sorting criterion PersonSortCriterion is a type. Thus, you can use it as a template argument for the set. This would not be possible if you implement the sorting criterion as a plain function  as was done in Section 6.8.2, page 228 .  All sets with this sorting criterion have their own type. You can’t combine or assign a set that has a “normal” or another user-deﬁned sorting criterion. Thus, you can’t compromise the automatic sorting of the set by any operation; however, you can design function objects that represent different sorting criteria with the same type  see Section 7.8.6, page 351 .   478  Chapter 10: STL Function Objects and Using Lambdas  10.1.2 Function Objects with Internal State  The following example shows how function objects can be used to behave as a function that may have more than one state at the same time:     fo sequence1.cpp  include   include   include   include   include "print.hpp" using namespace std;  class IntSequence {  private:  int value;  public:  }  }  };  int main   {  list  coll;  IntSequence  int initialValue      constructor  : value initialValue  {  int operator      { return ++value;     ‘‘function call’’     insert values from 1 to 9 generate_n  back_inserter coll ,  9, IntSequence 1  ;     start    number of elements    generates values, starting with 1  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll ;     replace second to last element but one with values starting at 42 generate  next coll.begin   ,  prev coll.end   , IntSequence 42  ;     start    end    generates values, starting with 42  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll ;  }   10.1 The Concept of Function Objects  479  In this example, the function object IntSequence generates a sequence of integral values. Each time operator    is called, it returns its actual value and increments it. You can pass the start value as a constructor argument.  Two such function objects are then used by the generate   and generate_n   algorithms,  which use generated values to write them into a collection: The expression  IntSequence 1   in the statement  generate_n  back_inserter coll ,  9, IntSequence 1  ;  creates such a function object initialized with 1. The generate_n   algorithm uses it nine times to write an element, so it generates values 1 to 9. Similarly, the expression  generates a sequence beginning with value 42. The generate   algorithm replaces the elements beginning with the second up to the last but one.1 The output of the program is as follows:  IntSequence 42   2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 2 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 10  Using other versions of operator   , you can easily produce more complicated sequences.  By default, function objects are passed by value rather than by reference. Thus, the algorithm does not change the state of the function object. For example, the following code generates the sequence starting with value 1 twice:  IntSequence seq 1 ;     integral sequence starting with value 1     insert sequence beginning with 1 generate_n  back_inserter coll , 9, seq ;     insert sequence beginning with 1 again generate_n  back_inserter coll , 9, seq ;  Passing function objects by value instead of by reference has the advantage that you can pass constant and temporary expressions. Otherwise, passing IntSequence 1  would not be possible.  The disadvantage of passing the function object by value is that you can’t beneﬁt from modiﬁ- cations of the state of the function objects. Algorithms can modify the state of the function objects, but you can’t access and process their ﬁnal states, because they make internal copies of the function objects. However, access to the ﬁnal state might be necessary, so the question is how to get a “result” from an algorithm.  There are three ways to get a “result” or “feedback” from function objects passed to algorithms:  1 std::next   and std::prev   are provided since C++11  see Section 9.3.2, page 443 . Note that using ++coll.begin   and --coll.end   might not always compile  see Section 9.2.6, page 440 .   480  Chapter 10: STL Function Objects and Using Lambdas  1. You can keep the state externally and let the function object refer to it. 2. You can pass the function objects by reference. 3. You can use the return value of the for_each   algorithm. The last option is discussed in the next subsection.  To pass a function object by reference, you simply have to qualify the call of the algorithm so  that the function object type is a reference.2 For example:     fo sequence2.cpp  include   include   include   include   include "print.hpp" using namespace std;  class IntSequence {  private:  int value;  public:     constructor IntSequence  int initialValue   : value initialValue  {  }  }     ‘‘function call’’ int operator      { return ++value;  };  int main   {  list  coll; IntSequence seq 1 ;     integral sequence starting with 1     insert values from 1 to 4    - pass function object by reference    generate_n >,  so that it will continue with 5  int, IntSequence&> back_inserter coll ,     start  4,     number of elements  2 Thanks to Philip Koster for pointing this out.  ¨   10.1 The Concept of Function Objects  481  seq ;     generates values  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll ;     insert values from 42 to 45 generate_n  back_inserter coll ,  4, IntSequence 42  ;  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll ;     continue with ﬁrst sequence    - pass function object by value    generate_n  back_inserter coll ,  so that it will continue with 5 again  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll ;     continue with ﬁrst sequence again generate_n  back_inserter coll ,  4, seq ;  4, seq ;  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll ;  }  The program has the following output:  2 3 4 5 2 3 4 5 43 44 45 46 2 3 4 5 43 44 45 46 6 7 8 9 2 3 4 5 43 44 45 46 6 7 8 9 6 7 8 9     start    number of elements    generates values     start    number of elements    generates values     start    number of elements    generates values  In the ﬁrst call of generate_n  , the function object seq is passed by reference. To do this, the template arguments are qualiﬁed explicitly:  generate_n >,  int, IntSequence&> back_inserter coll ,  4, seq ;     start    number of elements    generates values  As a result, the internal value of seq is modiﬁed after the call, and the second use of seq by the third call of generate_n   continues the sequence of the ﬁrst call. However, this call passes seq by value:  generate_n  back_inserter coll ,  4, seq ;     start    number of elements    generates values  Thus, the call does not change the state of seq. As a result, the last call of generate_n   continues the sequence with value 5 again.   482  Chapter 10: STL Function Objects and Using Lambdas  10.1.3 The Return Value of for_each    The effort involved with passing a function object by reference in order to access its ﬁnal state is not necessary if you use the for_each   algorithm. for_each   has the unique ability to return its function object  no other algorithm can do this . Thus, you can query the state of your function object by checking the return value of for_each  .  The following program is a nice example of the use of the return value of for_each  . It shows  how to process the mean value of a sequence:     fo foreach3.cpp  include   include   include   using namespace std;     function object to process the mean value class MeanValue {  private:  long num; long sum;  public:     number of elements    sum of all element values     constructor MeanValue    : num 0 , sum 0  { }     ‘‘function call’’    - process one more element of the sequence void operator    int elem  {  ++num; sum += elem;     increment count    add value     return mean value double value    {  }  }  };  int main   {  return static_cast  sum    static_cast  num ;  vector  coll = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 };   10.1 The Concept of Function Objects  483     process and print mean value MeanValue mv = for_each  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  cout << "mean value: " << mv.value   << endl;  MeanValue   ;     range    operation  }  The expression  MeanValue    creates a function object that counts the number of elements and processes the sum of all element values. By passing the function object to for_each  , it is called for each element of the container coll:  MeanValue mv = for_each  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  MeanValue   ;  The function object is returned and assigned to mv, so you can query its state after the statement by calling: mv.value  . Therefore, the program has the following output:  mean value: 4.5  You could even make the class MeanValue a bit smarter by deﬁning an automatic type conversion to double. You could then use the mean value that is processed by for_each   directly. See Section 11.4, page 522, for such an example.  Note that lambdas provide a more convenient way to specify this behavior  see Section 10.3.2, page 500, for a corresponding example . However, that does not mean that lambdas are always better than function objects. Function objects are more convenient when their type is required, such as for a declaration of a hash function, sorting, or equivalence criterion of associative or unordered containers. The fact that a function object is usually globally introduced helps to provide them in header ﬁles or libraries, whereas lambdas are better for speciﬁc behavior speciﬁed locally.  10.1.4 Predicates versus Function Objects  Predicates are functions or function objects that return a Boolean value  a value that is convertible into bool . However, not every function that returns a Boolean value is a valid predicate for the STL. This may lead to surprising behavior. Consider the following example:     fo removeif1.cpp  include   include   include   include "print.hpp" using namespace std;   484  Chapter 10: STL Function Objects and Using Lambdas  class Nth {  private:  int nth; int count;  public:     function object that returns true for the nth call     call for which to return true    call counter  Nth  int n  : nth n , count 0  { } bool operator    int  {  return ++count == nth;  }  };  int main   {  list  coll = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 }; PRINT_ELEMENTS coll,"coll:  " ;     remove third element list ::iterator pos; pos = remove_if coll.begin  ,coll.end  ,  coll.erase pos,coll.end   ;  Nth 3  ;  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll,"3rd removed: " ;     range    remove criterion  }  {  This program deﬁnes a function object Nth that yields true for the nth call. However, when passing it to remove_if  , an algorithm that removes all elements for which a unary predicate yields true  see Section 11.7.1, page 575 , the result is a big surprise:3  coll: 3rd removed: 1 2 4 5 7 8 9 10  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  Two elements, the third and sixth elements, are removed. This happens because the usual implemen- tation of the algorithm copies the predicate internally during the algorithm:  template   ForwIter std::remove_if ForwIter beg, ForwIter end,  Predicate op   beg = find_if beg, end, op ;  3 At least this is the output of gcc 4.5 and Visual C++ 2010, but other platforms might result in a different output; see the following discussion.   10.1 The Concept of Function Objects  485  if  beg == end  {  return beg;  } else {  }  }  ForwIter next = beg; return remove_copy_if ++next, end, beg, op ;  The algorithm uses find_if   to ﬁnd the ﬁrst element that should be removed. However, the algorithm then uses a copy of the passed predicate op to process the remaining elements, if any. Here, Nth in its original state is used again and also removes the third element of the remaining elements, which is in fact the sixth element.  This behavior is not a bug. The standard does not specify how often a predicate might be copied internally by an algorithm. Thus, to get the guaranteed behavior of the C++ standard library, you should not pass a function object for which the behavior depends on how often it is copied or called. Thus, if you call a unary predicate for two arguments and both arguments are equal, the predicate should always yield the same result.  In other words: A predicate should always be stateless. That is, a predicate should not change its state due to a call, and a copy of a predicate should have the same state as the original. To ensure that you can’t change the state of a predicate due to a function call, you should declare operator    as a constant member function.  It is possible to avoid this surprising behavior and to guarantee that this algorithm works as expected even for a function object such as Nth, without any performance penalties. You could implement remove_if   in such a way that the call of find_if   is replaced by its contents:  template   ForwIter std::remove_if ForwIter beg, ForwIter end,  {  while  beg != end && !op *beg   {  Predicate op   ++beg;  } if  beg == end  {  return beg;  } else {  }  }  ForwIter next = beg; return remove_copy_if ++next, end, beg, op ;  So, it might be a good idea to change the implementation of remove_if   or submit a change request to the implementer of the library. To my knowledge, this problem arises in current imple- mentations only with the remove_if   algorithm. If you use remove_copy_if  , all works as expected.  Whether the C++ standard library should guarantee the expected behavior in cases such   486  Chapter 10: STL Function Objects and Using Lambdas  as those presented in this example was under discussion but never changed.  However, for portabil- ity, you should never rely on this implementation detail. You should always declare the function call operator of predicates as being a constant member function.  Note that with lambdas, you can share the state among all copies of the function object, so this  problem doesn’t apply. See Section 10.3.2, page 501, for details.  10.2 Predeﬁned Function Objects and Binders  As mentioned in Section 6.10.2, page 239, the C++ standard library provides many predeﬁned func- tion objects and binders that allow you to compose them into more sophisticated function objects. This ability, called functional composition, requires fundamental function objects and adapters, which are both presented here. To use these function objects and binders, you must include the header ﬁle  :  include    10.2.1 Predeﬁned Function Objects  Table 10.1 lists all predeﬁned function objects  bit_and, bit_or, and bit_xor are available since C++11 .  Expression negate    plus    minus    multiplies    divides    modulus    equal_to    not_equal_to    less    greater    less_equal    greater_equal    logical_not    logical_and    logical_or    bit_and    bit_or    bit_xor     Effect - param param1 + param2 param1 - param2 param1 * param2 param1   param2 param1 % param2 param1 == param2 param1 != param2 param1 < param2 param1 > param2 param1 <= param2 param1 >= param2 ! param param1 && param2 param1  param2 param1 & param2 param1  param2 param1 ^ param2  Table10.1. PredeﬁnedFunctionObjects   10.2 Predeﬁned Function Objects and Binders  487  less  is the default criterion whenever objects are sorted or compared by sorting functions and associative containers. Thus, default sorting operations always produce an ascending order  element   is the default equivalence criterion for unordered containers.  To compare internationalized strings, the C++ standard library provides the ability to use locale objects as function objects so that they can be used as a sorting criterion for strings  see Section 16.3, page 868, for details .  10.2.2 Function Adapters and Binders  A function adapter is a function object that enables the composition of function objects with each other, with certain values, or with special functions  according to the composite pattern in [GoF:DesignPatterns] . However, over time, the way function objects are composed changed. In fact, all such features that were provided for C++98 are deprecated since C++11, which introduced more convenient and more ﬂexible adapters. Here, I ﬁrst present the current way to compose function objects. In Section 10.2.4, page 497, I give a very brief overview of the deprecated features. Table 10.2 lists the function adapters provided by the C++ standard library since C++11.  Effect  Expression bind op,args...  Binds args to op mem_fn op  not1 op  not2 op   Calls op   as a member function for an object or pointer to object Unary negation: !op param  Binary negation: !op param1,param2   Table10.2. PredeﬁnedFunctionAdapters  The most important adapter is bind  . It allows you to:   Adapt and compose new function objects out of existing or predeﬁned function objects   Call global functions   Call member functions for objects, pointers to objects, and smart pointers to objects  The bind   Adapter  In general, bind   binds parameters for callable objects  see Section 4.4, page 54 . Thus, if a function, member function, function object, or lambda requires some parameters, you can bind them to speciﬁc or passed arguments. Speciﬁc arguments you simply name. For passed arguments, you can use the predeﬁned placeholders _1, _2, ... deﬁned in namespace std::placeholders.  A typical application of binders is to specify parameters when using the predeﬁned function  objects provided by the C++ standard library  see Section 10.2.1, page 486 . For example:   488  Chapter 10: STL Function Objects and Using Lambdas     fo bind1.cpp  include   include    int main   {  auto plus10 = std::bind std::plus   ,  std::placeholders::_1, 10 ;  std::cout << "+10:  " << plus10 7  << std::endl;  auto plus10times2 = std::bind std::multiplies   ,  std::bind std::plus   ,  std::placeholders::_1, 10 ,  2 ;  std::cout << "+10 *2: " << plus10times2 7  << std::endl;  auto pow3 = std::bind std::multiplies   ,  std::bind std::multiplies   , std::placeholders::_1, std::placeholders::_1 ,  std::placeholders::_1 ; " << pow3 7  << std::endl;  std::cout << "x*x*x:  auto inversDivide = std::bind std::divides   , std::placeholders::_2, std::placeholders::_1 ;  std::cout << "invdiv: " << inversDivide 49,7  << std::endl;  }  Here, four different binders that represent function objects are deﬁned. For example, plus10, de- ﬁned as  std::bind std::plus   ,  std::placeholders::_1, 10   represents a function object, which internally calls plus   i.e., operator + , with a placeholder _1 as ﬁrst parameter operand and 10 as second parameter operand. The placeholder _1 represents the ﬁrst argument passed to the expression as a whole. Thus, for any argument passed to this expression, this function object yields the value of that argument +10.  To avoid the tedious repetition of the namespace placeholders, you can use a corresponding  using directive. Thus, with two using directives, you condense the whole statement:   10.2 Predeﬁned Function Objects and Binders  489  using namespace std; using namespace std::placeholders;  bind  plus   , _1, 10      param1+10  The binder can also be called directly. For example,  std::cout    ,_1,10  32  << std::endl;  will write 42 to standard output and, if you pass this function object to an algorithm, the algorithm can apply it to every element the algorithms operates with. For example:     add 10 to each element std::transform  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  coll.begin  , std::bind std::plus   ,_1,10  ;    operation     source    destination  In the same way, you can deﬁne a binder that represents a sorting criterion. For example, to ﬁnd the ﬁrst element that is greater than 42, you bind greater  with the passed argument as ﬁrst and 42 as second operator:     ﬁnd ﬁrst element >42 auto pos = std::find_if  coll.begin  ,coll.end  ,  std::bind std::greater   ,_1,42    Note that you always have to specify the argument type of the predeﬁned function object used. If the type doesn’t match, a type conversion is forced, or the expression results in a compile-time error.  The remaining statements in this example program demonstrate that you can nest binders to compose even more complicated function objects. For example, the following expression deﬁnes a function object that adds 10 to the passed argument and then multiplies it by 2  namespaces omitted :  bind multiplies   ,      param1+10 *2  As you can see, the expressions are evaluated from the inside to the outside.  Similarly, we can raise a value to the power of 3 by combining two multiplies  objects with  three placeholders for the argument passed:  bind multiplies   ,      param1*param1 *param1  bind plus   ,_1,  10 ,  2 ;  bind multiplies   ,_1,  _1 ,  _1 ;  The ﬁnal expression deﬁnes a function object, where the arguments for a division are swapped. Thus, it divides the second argument by the ﬁrst argument:  bind divides   ,_2,     param2 param1  Thus, the example program as a whole has the following output:  _1 ;   490  Chapter 10: STL Function Objects and Using Lambdas  +10: 17 +10 *2: 34 x*x*x: invdiv: 0.142857  343  Calling Global Functions  Section 6.10.3, page 241, offers some other examples of the use of binders. Section 10.3.1, page 499, provides the same functionality using lambdas.  The following example demonstrates how bind   can be used to call global functions  see Sec- tion 10.3.3, page 502, for a version with lambdas :     fo compose3.cpp  include   include   include   include   include   using namespace std; using namespace std::placeholders;  char myToupper  char c  {  }  int main   {  std::locale loc; return std::use_facet  > loc .toupper c ;  string s "Internationalization" ; string sub "Nation" ;     search substring case insensitive string::iterator pos; pos = search  s.begin  ,s.end  ,  sub.begin  ,sub.end  , bind equal_to   ,  bind myToupper,_1 , bind myToupper,_2   ;     string to search in    substring to search    compar. criterion  cout << "\"" << sub << "\" is part of \"" << s << "\""  if  pos != s.end    {  << endl;  }  }   10.2 Predeﬁned Function Objects and Binders  491  Here, we use the search   algorithm to check whether sub is a substring in s, when case sensitivity doesn’t matter. With  bind equal_to   ,  bind myToupper,_1 , bind myToupper,_2   ;  we create a function object calling:  myToupper param1 ==myToupper param2   where myToupper   is our own convenience function to convert the characters of the strings into uppercase  see Section 16.4.4, page 891, for details .  Note that bind   internally copies passed arguments. To let the function object use a reference  to a passed argument, use ref   or cref    see Section 5.4.3, page 132 . For example:  void incr  int& i  {  ++i;  }  int i=0; bind incr,i   ; bind incr,ref i    ;  Calling Member Functions     increments a copy of i, no effect for i    increments i  The following program demonstrates how bind   can be used to call member functions  see Sec- tion 10.3.3, page 503, for a version with lambdas :     fo bind2.cpp  include   include   include   include   include   using namespace std; using namespace std::placeholders;  class Person {  private:  string name;  public:  Person  const string& n  : name n  { } void print    const {  cout << name << endl;  }   492  Chapter 10: STL Function Objects and Using Lambdas  void print2  const string& prefix  const {  cout << prefix << name << endl;  } ...  };  int main   {  }  Here,  vector  coll  = { Person "Tick" , Person "Trick" , Person "Track"  };     call member function print   for each person for_each  coll.begin  , coll.end  , bind &Person::print,_1  ;  cout << endl;     call member function print2   with additional argument for each person for_each  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  bind &Person::print2,_1,"Person: "  ;  cout << endl;     call print2   for temporary Person bind &Person::print2,_1,"This is: "  Person "nico"  ;  bind &Person::print,_1   deﬁnes a function object that calls param1.print   for a passed Person. That is, because the ﬁrst argument is a member function, the next argument deﬁnes the object for which this member function gets called.  Any additional argument is passed to the member function. That means: bind &Person::print2,_1,"Person: "   deﬁnes a function object that calls param1.print2 "Person:  "  for any passed Person.  Here, the passed objects are the members of coll, but in principle, you can pass objects directly.  For example:  Person n "nico" ; bind &Person::print2,_1,"This is: "  n ;  calls n.print2 "This is:  " .  The output of the program is as follows:   10.2 Predeﬁned Function Objects and Binders  493  Tick Trick Track  Person: Tick Person: Trick Person: Track  This is: nico  Note that you can also pass pointers to objects and even smart pointers to bind  :  std::vector  cp; ... std::for_each  cp.begin  , cp.end  ,  std::bind &Person::print,  std::placeholders::_1  ;  std::vector > sp; ... std::for_each  sp.begin  , sp.end  ,  std::bind &Person::print,  Note that you can also call modifying member functions:  std::placeholders::_1  ;  class Person {  public:  }  };  ... void setName  const std::string& n  {  name = n;  std::vector  coll; ... std::for_each  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  std::bind &Person::setName,  std::placeholders::_1, "Paul"  ;     give all Persons same name  Calling virtual member functions also works. If a method of the base class is bound and the object is of a derived class, the correct virtual function of the derived class gets called.   494  Chapter 10: STL Function Objects and Using Lambdas  The mem_fn   Adapter  For member functions, you can also use the mem_fn   adapter, whereby you can skip the placeholder for the object the member function is called for:  std::for_each  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  std::mem_fn &Person::print  ;  Thus, mem_fn   simply calls an initialized member function for a passed argument while additional arguments are passed as parameters to the member function:  std::mem_fn &Person::print  n ; std::mem_fn &Person::print2  n,"Person: " ;     calls n.print      calls n.print2 "Person: "   However, to bind an additional argument to the function object, you again have to use bind  :  std::for_each  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  std::bind std::mem_fn &Person::print2 , std::placeholders::_1, "Person: "  ;  Binding to Data Members  You can also bind to data members. Consider the following example  namespaces omitted :4     map of int values associated to strings  map  coll; ...    accumulate all values  member second of the elements  int sum  = accumulate  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  0, bind plus   ,  _1, bind &map ::value_type::second,  _2   ;  Here, accumulate   is called, which uses a binary predicate to sum up all values of all elements  see Section 11.11.1, page 623 . However, because we use a map, where the elements are key value pairs, to gain access to an element’s value  bind &map ::value_type::second,_2   binds the passed second argument of each call of the predicate to its member second.  Adapters not1   and not2    The adapters not1   and not2   can be considered as almost deprecated.5 The only way to use them is to negate the meaning of predeﬁned function objects. For example:  4 This example is based on code taken from [Karlsson:Boost], page 260, with friendly permission by the author. 5 In fact, they were close to being deprecated with C++11, see [N3198:DeprAdapt]   10.2 Predeﬁned Function Objects and Binders  495  std::sort  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  std::not2 std::less     ;  This looks more convenient than:  std::sort  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  std::bind std::logical_not   ,  std::bind std::less   ,_1,_2   ;  However, there is no real real-world scenario for not1   and not2   because you can simply use another predeﬁned function object here:  std::sort  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  std::greater_equal    ;  More important, note that calling not2   with less  is wrong anyway. You probably meant to change the sorting from ascending to descending. But the negation of  =, not >. In fact, greater_equal  even leads to undeﬁned behavior because sort   requires a strict weak order- ing, which  = does not provide because it violates the requirement to be antisymmet- ric  see Section 7.7, page 314 . Thus, you either pass  greater     or swap the order of arguments by passing  bind less   ,_2,_1   See Section 10.2.4, page 497, for other examples using not1   and not2   with deprecated func- tion adapters.  10.2.3 User-Deﬁned Function Objects for Function Adapters  You can also use binders for your user-deﬁned function objects. The following example shows a complete deﬁnition for a function object that processes the ﬁrst argument raised to the power of the second argument:     fo fopow.hpp  include    template   struct fopow {  T1 operator    T1 base, T2 exp  const {  return std::pow base,exp ;  }  };  Note that the ﬁrst argument and the return value have the same type, T1, whereas the exponent may have a different type T2.   496  Chapter 10: STL Function Objects and Using Lambdas  The following program shows how to use the user-deﬁned function object fopow   . In par-  ticular, it uses fopow    with the bind   function adapters:     fo fopow1.cpp  include   include   include   include   include   include "fopow.hpp" using namespace std; using namespace std::placeholders;  int main   {  vector  coll = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 };     print 3 raised to the power of all elements transform  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  ostream_iterator  cout," " , bind fopow   ,3,_1  ;  cout << endl;     print all elements raised to the power of 3 transform  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  ostream_iterator  cout," " , bind fopow   ,_1,3  ;     source    destination    operation     source    destination    operation  cout << endl;  }  The program has the following output:  3 9 27 81 243 729 2187 6561 19683 1 8 27 64 125 216 343 512 729  Note that fopow    is realized for types float and int. If you use int for both base and exponent, you’d call pow   with two arguments of type int, but this isn’t portable, because according to the standard, pow   is overloaded for more than one but not all fundamental types:  transform  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  ostream_iterator  cout," " , bind1st fopow   ,3  ;     ERROR: ambiguous  See Section 17.3, page 942, for details about this problem.   10.2 Predeﬁned Function Objects and Binders  497  10.2.4 Deprecated Function Adapters  Table 10.3 lists the predeﬁned function adapter classes that were provided by the C++ standard library before C++11 and are deprecated now.6 Just in case you encounter the deprecated stuff, here are some brief examples of how to use them.  Effect Calls op arg,param  Calls op param,arg  Calls *op param  or *op param1,param2  Calls op   as a member function for a pointer to an object  Expression bind1st op,arg  bind2nd op,arg  ptr_fun op  mem_fun op  mem_fun_ref op  Calls op   as a member function for an object not1 op  not2 op   Unary negation: !op param  Binary negation: !op param1,param2   Table10.3. DeprecatedPredeﬁnedFunctionAdapters  Note that these adapters required certain type deﬁnitions in the functions objects used. To deﬁne these types, the C++ standard library provides special base classes for function adapters: std::unary_function  and std::binary_function . These classes also are deprecated now.  Both bind1st   and bind2nd   operate like bind  , with ﬁxed positions that a parameter is  bound to. For example:     ﬁnd ﬁrst element >42 std::find_if  coll.begin  ,coll.end  ,  std::bind2nd std::greater   ,42       range    criterion  However, bind1st   and bind2nd   can’t be used to compose binders out of binders or pass ordinary functions directly.  not1   and not2   are “almost deprecated” because they are useful only with the other depre-  cated function adapters. For example:  std::find_if  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  std::not1 std::bind2nd std::modulus   ,2   ;  ﬁnds the position of the ﬁrst even int  %2 yields 0 for even values, which not1   negates into true . However, this looks more convenient than using the new binders:  std::find_if  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  std::bind std::logical_not   ,  std::bind std::modulus   ,  std::placeholders::_1, 2   ;  6 Although not1   and not2   are not ofﬁcially deprecated, you need the other deprecated function adapters for real-world usage.   498  Chapter 10: STL Function Objects and Using Lambdas  Being able to use a lambda is really an improvement here:  std::find_if  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  [] int elem {  return elem%2==0;  } ;  ptr_fun   was provided to be able to call ordinary functions. For example, suppose that you have a global function, which checks something for each parameter:  bool check int elem ;  To ﬁnd the ﬁrst element for which the check does not succeed, you could call the following statement:  std::find_if  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  std::not1 std::ptr_fun check   ;     range    search criterion  The second form of ptr_fun   was used when you had a global function for two parameters and, for example, you wanted to use it as a unary function:     ﬁnd ﬁrst string that is not empty std::find_if  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  std::bind2nd std::ptr_fun std::strcmp ,""  ;  Here, the strcmp   C function is used to compare each element with the empty C-string. If both strings match, strcmp   returns 0, which is equivalent to false. So, this call of find_if   returns the position of the ﬁrst element that is not the empty string.  Both mem_fun   and mem_fun_ref   were provided to deﬁne function objects that call member  functions.7 For example:  class Person {  public:  void print    const; ...  };  const std::vector  coll; ...    call member function print   for each person std::for_each  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  std::mem_fun_ref &Person::print  ;  Note that the member functions called by mem_fun_ref   and mem_fun   and passed as arguments to bind1st   or bind2nd   must be constant member functions.  7 These member mem_fun_ref_t, const_mem_fun_t, const_mem_fun_ref_t, mem_fun1_t, mem_fun1_ref_t, const_mem_fun1_t, and const_mem_fun1_ref_t.  classes mem_fun_t,  auxiliary  function  adapters  use  the   10.3 Using Lambdas  499  10.3 Using Lambdas  As introduced in Section 3.1.10, page 28, lambdas were introduced with C++11. They provide a powerful and very convenient way to provide local functionality, especially to specify details of algorithms and member functions. Although lambdas are a language feature, their use is so important for the C++ standard library that I will go into a couple of details here.  As introduced in Section 6.9, page 229, lambdas provide signiﬁcant improvements for C++ when using the STL because now you have an intuitive, readable way to pass individual behavior to algo- rithms and container member functions. If you need speciﬁc behavior passed to an algorithm, just specify it like any other function right there where you need it.  The best way to demonstrate the use of lambdas is by example, especially when comparing corresponding code not using lambdas. In the following subsections, I provide some examples of functionality introduced before with other function objects and adapters, such as bind  .  10.3.1 Lambdas versus Binders  Take, for example, fo bind1.cpp, which is presented in Section 10.2.2, page 488. When lambdas are used, the corresponding code looks as follows:     fo lambda1.cpp  include    int main   {  auto plus10 = []  int i  {  return i+10;  };  std::cout << "+10:  " << plus10 7  << std::endl;  auto plus10times2 = []  int i  {  return  i+10 *2;  std::cout << "+10 *2: " << plus10times2 7  << std::endl;  auto pow3 = []  int i  {  return i*i*i;  };  std::cout << "x*x*x:  " << pow3 7  << std::endl;  auto inversDivide = []  double d1, double d2  {  return d2 d1;  };  };  std::cout << "invdiv: " << inversDivide 49,7  << std::endl;  }   500  Chapter 10: STL Function Objects and Using Lambdas  Just to compare one function object declaration: Declaring to “add 10 and multiply by 2” looks with binders as follows:  auto plus10times2 = std::bind std::multiplies   ,  std::bind std::plus   ,  std::placeholders::_1, 10 ,  2 ;  The same functionality deﬁned with lambdas looks as follows:  auto plus10times2 = []  int i  {  return  i+10 *2;  };  10.3.2 Lambdas versus Stateful Function Objects  Let’s now replace a custom function object by a lambda. Consider the example to process the mean value of elements in Section 10.1.3, page 482. A version with lambdas looks as follows:     fo lambda2.cpp  include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {  vector  coll = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 };     process and print mean value long sum = 0; for_each  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,     range  [&sum]  int elem  {  sum += elem;  } ;  double mv = static_cast  sum  static_cast  coll.size   ; cout << "mean value: " << mv << endl;  }  Here, instead of the need to deﬁne a class for the function object passed, you simply pass the re- quired functionality. However, the state of the calculation is held outside the lambda in sum, so you ultimately have to use sum to compute the mean value.  With a function object, this state  sum  is entirely encapsulated, and we can provide additional  member functions to deal with the state  such as to process the mean value out of sum .   10.3 Using Lambdas  501  MeanValue mv = for_each  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  cout << "mean value: " << mv.value   << endl;  MeanValue   ;     range    operation  So, from a calling point of view, you can consider the user-deﬁned function object as being more condensed and less error-prone than the lambda version presented here.  When dealing with state, you should also be careful when using mutable. Consider the example introduced in Section 10.1.4, page 483, in which your search criterion is a stateful function object searching for the third element. A corresponding version using lambdas should, strictly speaking, pass the internal counter, which represents its state, by value because the counter is not needed outside the algorithm called. By using mutable, you could provide write access to this state then for all “function calls”:     fo lambda3.cpp  include   include   include   include "print.hpp" using namespace std;  int main   {  list  coll = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 }; PRINT_ELEMENTS coll,"coll:  " ;     remove third element list ::iterator pos; int count=0; pos = remove_if coll.begin  ,coll.end  , [count]  int  mutable { return ++count == 3;     call counter  coll.erase pos,coll.end   ;  } ;  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll,"3rd removed: " ;  }     range    remove criterion  However, as described in Section 10.1.4, page 483, you can then run into the problem that two elements, the third and the sixth, get removed, which results in the following output:  coll: 3rd removed: 1 2 4 5 7 8 9 10  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  Again, the reason for this output is that the lambda object gets copied by the remove_if   algorithm while it is running, so two lambda objects exist that both remove the third element. Thus, the state gets duplicated.   502  Chapter 10: STL Function Objects and Using Lambdas  If you pass the argument by reference and don’t use mutable, the behavior is as expected, because both lambda objects internally used by remove_if   share the same state. Thus, with the following:  int count=0; pos = remove_if coll.begin  ,coll.end  ,     call counter  [&count]  int  {  return ++count == 3;  } ;  the output is:  coll: 3rd removed: 1 2 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10     range    remove criterion  10.3.3 Lambdas Calling Global and Member Functions  Of course, any lambda can call other functions, so the lambda version of fo compose3.cpp in Section 10.2.2, page 490, looks as follows:     fo lambda4.cpp  include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  char myToupper  char c  {  }  int main   {  std::locale loc; return std::use_facet  > loc .toupper c ;  string s "Internationalization" ; string sub "Nation" ;     search substring case insensitive string::iterator pos; pos = search  s.begin  ,s.end  ,  sub.begin  ,sub.end  , []  char c1, char c2  {  return myToupper c1 ==myToupper c2 ;  } ;     string to search in    substring to search    compar. criterion   10.3 Using Lambdas  503  cout << "\"" << sub << "\" is part of \"" << s << "\""  if  pos != s.end    {  << endl;  }  }  Of course, you can call member functions the same way  compare with Section 10.2.2, page 491 :     fo lambda5.cpp  include   include   include   include   include   using namespace std; using namespace std::placeholders;  class Person {  private:  string name;  public:  Person  const string& n  : name n  { } void print    const {  cout << name << endl;  } void print2  const string& prefix  const {  cout << prefix << name << endl;  } ...  };  int main   {     call member function print   for each person for_each  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  []  const Person& p  {  p.print  ;  } ; cout << endl;  vector  coll  = { Person "Tick" , Person "Trick" , Person "Track"  };   }  ...  ...  ...  };  };  504  Chapter 10: STL Function Objects and Using Lambdas     call member function print2   with additional argument for each person for_each  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  []  const Person& p  {  p.print2 "Person: " ;  } ;  10.3.4 Lambdas as Hash Function, Sorting, or  Equivalence Criterion  As mentioned before, you can also use lambdas as hash functions, ordering, or sorting criteria. For example:  class Person {  auto hash = []  const Person& p  {  }; auto eq = []  const Person& p1, Person& p2  {     create unordered set with user-deﬁned behavior unordered_set  pset 10,hash,eq ;  Note again that you have to use decltype to pass the type of the lambda to the unordered_set because it creates its own instance of them. In addition, you have to pass a hash function and equiva- lence criterion to the constructor because otherwise, the constructor calls the default constructor for the hash function and equivalence criterion, which is not deﬁned for lambdas.  Due to these inconveniences, specifying a class for the function objects here can be considered as being more readable and even more convenient. So when state is involved, lambdas are not always better.  See Section 7.9.7, page 379, for a complete example of how to use lambdas to specify a hash  function and an equivalence criterion for unordered containers.   Chapter 11 STL Algorithms  This chapter describes all the algorithms of the C++ standard library. It begins with an overview of the algorithms and some general remarks about them. The chapter then presents the exact signature of each algorithm and one or more examples of its use.  11.1 Algorithm Header Files  To use the algorithms of the C++ standard library, you must include the header ﬁle  :  include    This header ﬁle also includes some auxiliary functions: min  , max  , and minmax   were pre- sented in Section 5.5.1, page 134. The iter_swap   iterator function was discussed in Section 9.3.4, page 446.  Some of the STL algorithms are provided for numeric processing. Thus, they are deﬁned in   :  include    In general, Chapter 17 discusses the numeric components of the C++ standard library. However, I decided to discuss the numeric algorithms here because, in my opinion, the fact that they are STL algorithms is more important than the fact that they are used for numeric processing.  When you use algorithms, you often also need function objects and function adapters. These  were described in Chapter 10 and are deﬁned in  :  include    11.2 Algorithm Overview  This section presents an overview of all the C++ standard library algorithms to give you an idea of their abilities and to be better able to ﬁnd the best algorithm to solve a certain problem.   506  Chapter 11: STL Algorithms  11.2.1 A Brief Introduction  Algorithms were introduced in Chapter 6 along with the STL. In particular, Section 6.4, page 199, and Section 6.7, page 217, discuss the role of algorithms and some important constraints about their use. All STL algorithms process one or more iterator ranges. The ﬁrst range is usually speciﬁed by its beginning and its end. For additional ranges, you generally need to pass only the beginning because the end follows from the number of elements of the ﬁrst range. The caller must ensure that the ranges are valid. That is, the beginning must refer to a previous or the same element of the same container as the end. Additional ranges must have enough elements.  Algorithms work in overwrite mode rather than in insert mode. Thus, the caller must ensure that destination ranges have enough elements. You can use special insert iterators  see Section 9.4.2, page 454  to switch from overwrite to insert mode.  To increase their ﬂexibility and power, several algorithms allow the user to pass user-deﬁned operations, which they call internally. These operations might be ordinary functions or function objects. If these functions return a Boolean value, they are called predicates. You can use predicates for the following tasks:   You can pass a function, a function object, or a lambda that speciﬁes a unary predicate as the search criterion for a search algorithm. The unary predicate is used to check whether an element ﬁts the criterion. For example, you could search the ﬁrst element that is less than 50.   You can pass a function, a function object, or a lambda that speciﬁes a binary predicate as the sorting criterion for a sort algorithm. The binary predicate is used to compare two elements. For example, you could pass a criterion that lets objects that represent a person sort according to the person’s last name  see Section 10.1.1, page 476, for an example .   You can pass a unary predicate as the criterion that speciﬁes for which elements an operation should apply. For example, you could specify that only elements with an odd value should be removed.   You can specify the numeric operation of numeric algorithms. For example, you could use accumulate  , which normally processes the sum of elements, to process the product of all elements.  Note that predicates should not modify their state due to a function call  see Section 10.1.4, page 483 . See Section 6.8, page 224, Section 6.9, page 229, Section 6.10, page 233, and Chapter 10 for examples and details about functions, function objects, and lambdas that are used as algorithm para- meters.  11.2.2 Classiﬁcation of Algorithms  Different algorithms meet different needs and so can be classiﬁed by their main purposes. For example, some algorithms operate as read only, some modify elements, and some change the order of elements. This subsection gives you a brief idea of the functionality of each algorithm and in which aspect it differs from similar algorithms.  The name of an algorithm gives you a ﬁrst impression of its purpose. The designers of the STL  introduced two special sufﬁxes:   11.2 Algorithm Overview  507  1. The _if sufﬁx is used when you can call two forms of an algorithm that have the same number of parameters either by passing a value or by passing a function or function object. In this case, the version without the sufﬁx is used for values, and the version with the _if sufﬁx is used for functions and function objects. For example, find   searches for an element that has a certain value, whereas find_if   searches for an element that meets the criterion passed as a function, a function object, or a lambda.  However, not all algorithms that have a parameter for functions and function objects have the _if sufﬁx. When the function or function-object version of an algorithm has an additional argument, it has the same name. For example, min_element   called with two arguments returns the minimum element in the range according to a comparison with operator <. If you pass a third element, it is used as the comparison criterion.  2. The _copy sufﬁx is used as an indication that elements are not only manipulated but also copied into a destination range. For example, reverse   reverses the order of elements inside a range, whereas reverse_copy   copies the elements into another range in reverse order.  The following subsections and sections describe the algorithms according to the following classiﬁ- cation:   Nonmodifying algorithms   Modifying algorithms   Removing algorithms   Mutating algorithms   Sorting algorithms   Sorted-range algorithms   Numeric algorithms Algorithms belonging to more than one category are described in the category I consider to be the most important.  Nonmodifying Algorithms  Nonmodifying algorithms change neither the order nor the value of the elements they process. These algorithms operate with input and forward iterators; therefore, you can call them for all standard containers. Table 11.1 lists the nonmodifying algorithms of the C++ standard library. See page 515 for nonmodifying algorithms that are provided especially for sorted input ranges.  Historically, one of the most important algorithms was for_each  . for_each   calls an oper- ation provided by the caller for each element. That operation is usually used to process each element of the range individually. For example, you can pass for_each   a function that prints each element or calls a modifying operation for each element. Note, however, that since C++11, the range-based for loop provides this behavior more conveniently and more naturally  see Section 3.1.4, page 17, and Section 6.2.1, page 174 . Thus, for_each   might lose its importance over time.  Several of the nonmodifying algorithms perform searching. Unfortunately, the naming scheme of searching algorithms is a mess. In addition, the naming schemes of searching algorithms and searching string functions differ  Table 11.2 . As is often the case, there are historical reasons for this. First, the STL and string classes were designed independently. Second, the find_end  ,   508  Chapter 11: STL Algorithms  Name for_each   count   count_if   min_element   max_element   minmax_element    find   find_if   find_if_not    search_n    search   find_end   find_first_of   adjacent_find    equal   is_permutation    mismatch   lexicographical... _compare    is_sorted    Effect Performs an operation for each element Returns the number of elements Returns the number of elements that match a criterion Returns the element with the smallest value Returns the element with the largest value Returns the elements with the smallest and largest value  since C++11  Searches for the ﬁrst element with the passed value Searches for the ﬁrst element that matches a criterion Searches for the ﬁrst element that matches a criterion not  since C++11  Searches for the ﬁrst n consecutive elements with certain properties Searches for the ﬁrst occurrence of a subrange Searches for the last occurrence of a subrange Searches the ﬁrst of several possible elements Searches for two adjacent elements that are equal  by some criterion  Returns whether two ranges are equal Returns whether two unordered ranges contain equal elements  since C++11  Returns the ﬁrst elements of two sequences that differ Returns whether a range is lexicographically less than another range Returns whether the elements in a range are sorted  since C++11   is_sorted_until   Returns the ﬁrst unsorted element in a range  since C++11  is_partitioned    Returns whether the elements in a range are partitioned in two groups according to a criterion  since C++11   partition_point   Returns the partitioning element for a range partitioned into  is_heap    is_heap_until    all_of   any_of    none_of    elements fulﬁlling and elements not fulﬁlling a predicate  since C++11  Returns whether the elements in a range are sorted as a heap  since C++11  Returns the ﬁrst element in a range not sorted as a heap  since C++11  Returns whether all elements match a criterion  since C++11  Returns whether at least one element matches a criterion  since C++11  Returns whether none of the elements matches a criterion  since C++11   Table11.1.

ComparisonofSearchingStringOperationsandAlgorithms  find_first_of  , and search_n   algorithms were not part of the original STL. So, for exam- ple, the name find_end   instead of search_end   was chosen by accident  it is easy to forget aspects of the whole picture, such as consistency, when you are caught up in the details . Also by accident, a form of search_n   breaks the general concept of the original STL. See Section 11.5.3, page 532, for a description of this problem.  Modifying Algorithms  Modifying algorithms change the value of elements. Such algorithms might modify the elements of a range directly or modify them while they are being copied into another range. If elements are copied into a destination range, the source range is not changed. Table 11.3 lists the modifying algorithms of the C++ standard library.  The fundamental modifying algorithms are for_each    again  and transform  . You can use both to modify elements of a sequence. However, their behavior differs as follows:   for_each   accepts an operation that modiﬁes its argument. Thus, the argument has to be  passed by reference. For example: void square  int& elem  {     call-by-reference  elem = elem * elem;     assign processed value directly  } ... for_each coll.begin  ,coll.end  ,  square ;     range    operation  used to assign the result to the original element. For example:  int square  int elem  {     call-by-value  return elem * elem;     return processed value  }    transform   uses an operation that returns the modiﬁed argument. The trick is that it can be   510  Chapter 11: STL Algorithms  Name for_each   copy   copy_if   copy_n   copy_backward   move    move_backward    transform    merge   swap_ranges   fill   fill_n   generate   generate_n   iota    replace    replace_if    replace_copy    Effect Performs an operation for each element Copies a range starting with the ﬁrst element Copies elements that match a criterion  since C++11  Copies n elements  since C++11  Copies a range starting with the last element Moves elements of a range starting with the ﬁrst element  since C++11  Moves elements of a range starting with the last element  since C++11  Modiﬁes  and copies  elements; combines elements of two ranges Merges two ranges Swaps elements of two ranges Replaces each element with a given value Replaces n elements with a given value Replaces each element with the result of an operation Replaces n elements with the result of an operation Replaces each element with a sequence of incremented values  since C++11  Replaces elements that have a special value with another value Replaces elements that match a criterion with another value Replaces elements that have a special value while copying the whole range  Page 519 557 557 557 561 557  561  563 564 614 566 568 568 569 569 571  571  571  573  573  replace_copy_if   Replaces elements that match a criterion while copying  the whole range  Table11.3. ModifyingAlgorithms  ... transform  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  coll.begin  , square ;     source range    destination range    operation  Using transform   is a bit slower because it returns and assigns the result instead of modifying the element directly. However, it is more ﬂexible because it can also be used to modify elements while they are being copied into a different destination sequence. Another version of transform   can process and combine elements of two source ranges.  Strictly speaking, merge   does not necessarily have to be part of the list of modifying algo- rithms, because it requires that its input ranges be sorted. So, it should be part of the algorithms for sorted ranges  see page 515 . In practice, however, merge   also merges the elements of unsorted   11.2 Algorithm Overview  511  ranges. Of course, then the result is unsorted. Nevertheless, to be safe, you should call merge   only for sorted ranges.  Note that elements of associative and unordered containers are constant to ensure that you can’t compromise the sorted order of the elements due to an element modiﬁcation. Therefore, you can’t use these containers as a destination for modifying algorithms.  In addition to these modifying algorithms, the C++ standard library provides modifying algo-  rithms for sorted ranges. See page 515 for details.  Removing Algorithms  Removing algorithms are a special form of modifying algorithms. They can remove the elements either in a single range or while these elements are being copied into another range. As with mod- ifying algorithms, you can’t use an associative or unordered container as a destination, because the elements of these containers are considered to be constant. Table 11.4 lists the removing algorithms of the C++ standard library.  Name remove   remove_if   remove_copy   remove_copy_if   Copies elements that do not match a given criterion unique    Effect Removes elements with a given value Removes elements that match a given criterion Copies elements that do not match a given value  Removes adjacent duplicates  elements that are equal to their predecessor  Copies elements while removing adjacent duplicates  unique_copy    Page 575 575 577 577 578  580  Table11.4. RemovingAlgorithms  Note that these algorithms remove elements logically only by overwriting them with the fol- lowing elements that were not removed. Thus, removing algorithms do not change the number of elements in the ranges on which they operate. Instead, they return the position of the new “end” of the range. It’s up to the caller to use that new end, such as to remove the elements physically. See Section 6.7.1, page 218, for a detailed discussion of this behavior.  Mutating algorithms are algorithms that change the order of elements  and not their values  by assigning and swapping their values. Table 11.5 lists the mutating algorithms of the C++ standard library. As with modifying algorithms, you can’t use an associative or unordered container as a destination, because the elements of these containers are considered to be constant.  Mutating Algorithms  Sorting Algorithms  Sorting algorithms are a special kind of mutating algorithm because they also change the order of the elements. However, sorting is more complicated and therefore usually takes more time than   512  Chapter 11: STL Algorithms  Name reverse   reverse_copy   rotate   rotate_copy   next_permutation   prev_permutation   shuffle   random_shuffle   partition    stable_partition    partition_copy    Effect Reverses the order of the elements Copies the elements while reversing their order Rotates the order of the elements Copies the elements while rotating their order Permutates the order of the elements Permutates the order of the elements Brings the elements into a random order  since C++11  Brings the elements into a random order Changes the order of the elements so that elements that match a criterion are at the front Same as partition   but preserves the relative order of matching and nonmatching elements Copies the elements while changing the order so that elements that match a criterion are at the front  Page 583 583 584 585 587 587 589 589 592  592  594  Table11.5. MutatingAlgorithms  simple mutating operations. In fact, these algorithms usually have worse than linear complexity1 and require random-access iterators  for the destination . Table 11.6 lists the sorting algorithms. Table 11.7 lists the corresponding algorithms that allow checking whether a sequence is  partially  sorted.  Time often is critical for sorting algorithms. Therefore, the C++ standard library provides more than one sorting algorithm. The algorithms use different ways of sorting, and some algorithms don’t sort all elements. For example, nth_element   stops when the nth element of the sequence is correct according to the sorting criterion. For the other elements, it guarantees only that the previous elements have a lesser or equal value and that the following elements have a greater or equal value. To sort all elements of a sequence, you should consider the following algorithms:   sort  , based historically on quicksort.

Thus, it guarantees n ∗ log n  complexity in any case. However, in most circumstances, heapsort is slower than quicksort by a factor of two to ﬁve. So, if sort   is implemented as quicksort and partial_sort   is implemented  1 See Section 2.2, page 10, for an introduction to and a discussion of complexity.   11.2 Algorithm Overview  Effect Sorts all elements Sorts while preserving order of equal elements Sorts until the ﬁrst n elements are correct  Name sort   stable_sort   partial_sort   partial_sort_copy   Copies elements in sorted order nth_element   partition    stable_partition    partition_copy    make_heap   push_heap   pop_heap   sort_heap    Sorts according to the nth position Changes the order of the elements so that elements that match a criterion are at the beginning Same as partition   but preserves the relative order of matching and nonmatching elements Copies the elements while changing the order so that elements that match a criterion are at the beginning Converts a range into a heap Adds an element to a heap Removes an element from a heap Sorts the heap  it is no longer a heap after the call   Table11.6.

AlgorithmsCheckingforSortings  as heapsort, partial_sort   has the better complexity, but sort   has the better runtime in most cases. The advantage of partial_sort   is that it guarantees n ∗ log n  complexity in any case, so it never reaches quadratic complexity.  In addition, partial_sort   has the special ability to stop sorting when only the ﬁrst n elements need to be sorted. To sort all the elements, you have to pass the end of the sequence as second and last argument:   514  Chapter 11: STL Algorithms     sort all elements    - always n*log n  complexity    - but usually twice as long as sort   partial_sort  coll.begin  , coll.end  , coll.end   ;    stable_sort  , based historically on mergesort. It sorts all the elements:     sort all elements    - n*log n  or n*log n *log n  complexity stable_sort  coll.begin  , coll.end   ;  However, it needs enough additional memory to have n ∗ log n  complexity. Otherwise, it has n ∗ log n  ∗ log n  complexity. The advantage of stable_sort   is that it preserves the order of equal elements.  Now you have a brief idea of which sorting algorithm might best meet your needs. But the story doesn’t end here. The standard guarantees complexity but not how it is implemented. This is an advantage in that an implementation could beneﬁt from algorithm innovations and use a better way of sorting without breaking the standard. For example, the sort   algorithm in the SGI implemen- tation of the STL is implemented by using introsort. Introsort is a new algorithm that, by default, operates like quicksort but switches to heapsort when it is going to have quadratic complexity. The disadvantage of the fact that the standard does not guarantee exact complexity is that an implemen- tation could use a standard-conforming, but very bad, algorithm. For example, using heapsort to implement sort   would be standard conforming. Of course, you simply could test which algo- rithm ﬁts best, but be aware that measurements might not be portable.  There are even more algorithms to sort elements. For example, the heap algorithms are pro- vided to call the functions that implement a heap directly  a heap can be considered as a binary tree implemented as sequential collection . The heap algorithms are provided and used as the base for efﬁcient implementations of priority queues  see Section 12.3, page 641 . You can use them to sort all elements of a collection by calling them as follows:     sort all elements    - n+n*log n  complexity make_heap  coll.begin  , coll.end   ; sort_heap  coll.begin  , coll.end   ;  See Section 11.9.4, page 604, for details about heaps and heap algorithms.  The nth_element   algorithms are provided if you need only the nth sorted element or the set of the n highest or n lowest elements  not sorted . Thus, nth_element   is a way to split elements into two subsets according to a sorting criterion. However, you could also use partition   or stable_partition   to do this. The differences are as follows:   For nth_element  , you pass the number of elements you want to have in the ﬁrst part  and  therefore also in the second part . For example:    move the four lowest elements to the front nth_element  coll.begin  ,  coll.begin  +3, coll.end   ;     beginning of range    position between ﬁrst and second part    end of range   11.2 Algorithm Overview  515  However, after the call, you don’t know the exact criterion that is the difference between the ﬁrst and the second parts. Both parts may, in fact, have elements with the same value as the nth element.   For partition  , you pass the exact sorting criterion that serves as the difference between  the ﬁrst and the second parts. For example:     move all elements less than seven to the front vector ::iterator pos; pos = partition  coll1.begin  , coll1.end  ,  [] int elem {  return elem<7;  } ;     range    criterion  Here, after the call, you don’t know how many elements are owned by the ﬁrst and the second parts. The return value pos refers to the ﬁrst element of the second part that contains all elements that don’t match the criterion, if any.   stable_partition   behaves similarly to partition   but has an additional ability. It guarantees that the order of the elements in both parts remains stable according to their relative positions to the other elements in the same part.  You can always pass the sorting criterion to all sorting algorithms as an optional argument. The default sorting argument is the function object less , so that elements are sorted in ascending order according to their values. Note that the sorting criterion has to deﬁne a strict weak ordering on the values. A criterion, where values are compared as equal or less, such as operator <=, does not ﬁt this requirement. See Section 7.7, page 314, for details.  As with modifying algorithms, you can’t use an associative container as a destination, because  the elements of the associative containers are considered to be constant.  Lists and forward lists do not provide random-access iterators, so you can’t call sorting algo- rithms for them either. However, both provide a member function sort   to sort their elements; see Section 8.8.1, page 422.  Sorted-Range Algorithms  Sorted-range algorithms require that the ranges on which they operate be sorted according to their sorting criterion. Table 11.8 lists all C++ standard library algorithms that are especially written for sorted ranges. As for associative containers, these algorithms have the advantage of a better complexity.  The ﬁrst ﬁve sorted-range algorithms in Table 11.8 are nonmodifying, searching only according to their purpose. The other algorithms combine two sorted input ranges and write the result to a destination range. In general, the result of these algorithms is also sorted.  Numeric Algorithms  These algorithms combine numeric elements in different ways. Table 11.9 lists the numeric algo- rithms of the C++ standard library. If you understand the names, you get an idea of the purpose of the algorithms. However, these algorithms are more ﬂexible and more powerful than they may seem at ﬁrst. For example, by default, accumulate   processes the sum of all elements. When you use   516  Chapter 11: STL Algorithms  Name binary_search   includes    lower_bound    upper_bound   equal_range    merge   set_union   set_intersection   set_difference    set_symmetric_difference    inplace_merge   partition_point    Effect Returns whether the range contains an element Returns whether each element of a range is also an element of another range Finds the ﬁrst element greater than or equal to a given value Finds the ﬁrst element greater than a given value Returns the range of elements equal to a given value Merges the elements of two ranges Processes the sorted union of two ranges Processes the sorted intersection of two ranges Processes a sorted range that contains all elements of a range that are not part of another range Processes a sorted range that contains all elements that are in exactly one of two ranges Merges two consecutive sorted ranges Returns the partitioning element for a range partitioned into elements fulﬁlling and elements not fulﬁlling a predicate  since C++11   Page 608 609  611  611 613  614 616 617 618  619  622 552  Table11.8.

NumericAlgorithms  strings as elements, you concatenate them by using this algorithm. When you switch from operator + to operator *, you get the product of all elements. As another example, you should know that adjacent_difference   and partial_sum   transfer a range of absolute values into a range of relative values and vice versa.  Both accumulate   and inner_product   process and return a single value without modify- ing the ranges. The other algorithms write the results to a destination range that has the same number of elements as the source range.   11.3 Auxiliary Functions  517  11.3 Auxiliary Functions  The rest of this chapter discusses the algorithms in detail and includes at least one example of each algorithm. To simplify the examples, I use some auxiliary functions so that you can concentrate on the essence of the examples:     algo algostuff.hpp  ifndef ALGOSTUFF_HPP define ALGOSTUFF_HPP  include   include   include   include   include   include   include   include   include   include   include   include   include   include   include       INSERT_ELEMENTS  collection, first, last     - ﬁll values from ﬁrst to last into the collection    - NOTE: NO half-open range template   inline void INSERT_ELEMENTS  T& coll, int first, int last  {  for  int i=first; i<=last; ++i  {  coll.insert coll.end  ,i ;  }  }     PRINT_ELEMENTS      - prints optional string optcstr followed by    - all elements of the collection coll    - separated by spaces template     518  Chapter 11: STL Algorithms  inline void PRINT_ELEMENTS  const T& coll,  const std::string& optcstr=""   std::cout << optcstr; for  auto elem : coll  {  std::cout << elem << ’ ’;  } std::cout << std::endl;     PRINT_MAPPED_ELEMENTS      - prints optional string optcstr followed by    - all elements of the key value collection coll    - separated by spaces template   inline void PRINT_MAPPED_ELEMENTS  const T& coll,  const std::string& optcstr=""   std::cout << optcstr; for  auto elem : coll  {  std::cout << ’[’ << elem.first  << ’,’ << elem.second << "] ";  } std::cout << std::endl;  {  }  {  }  endif  *ALGOSTUFF_HPP*   First, algostuff.hpp includes all header ﬁles that may be necessary to implement the examples, so the program doesn’t have to do it. Second, it deﬁnes three auxiliary functions:2 1. INSERT_ELEMENTS   inserts elements into the container that is passed as the ﬁrst argument. These elements get the values from the value passed as the second argument up to the value passed as the third argument. Both argument values are included, so this is not a half-open range. 2. PRINT_ELEMENTS   prints all elements of the container that is passed as the ﬁrst argument, separated by spaces. You can pass a second argument optionally for a string that is used as a preﬁx in front of the elements  see Section 6.6, page 216 .  3. PRINT_MAPPED_ELEMENTS   is the same for containers with a key value pair: map, multimap,  unordered map, and unordered multimap.  2 Since C++11, PRINT_MAPPED_ELEMENTS   could also be deﬁned as partial specialization of PRINT_ELEMENTS  . However, to avoid requiring too many new language features, both functions are de- ﬁned separately.   11.4 The for_each   Algorithm  519  11.4 The for_each   Algorithm  The for_each   algorithm is very ﬂexible because it allows you to access, process, and modify each element in many different ways. Note, however, that since C++11, the range-based for loop provides this behavior more conveniently and more naturally  see Section 3.1.4, page 17, and Sec- tion 6.2.1, page 174 . Thus, for_each   might lose its importance over time.  UnaryProc for_each  InputIterator beg, InputIterator end, UnaryProc op    Calls  op elem   for each element in the range [beg,end .  the transform   algorithm, which is able to do the same thing in a slightly different way.    Returns the  internally modiﬁed  copy of op. Since C++11, the returned op is moved.   op might modify the elements. However, see Section 11.2.2, page 509, for a comparison with   Any return value of op is ignored.   See Section 6.10.1, page 235, for the implementation of the for_each   algorithm.   Complexity: linear  numElems calls of op   . The following example of for_each   passes each element to a lambda that prints the passed element. Thus, the call prints each element:     algo foreach1.cpp  include "algostuff.hpp" using namespace std;  int main   {  vector  coll;  INSERT_ELEMENTS coll,1,9 ;     call print   for each element for_each  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  [] int elem {  cout << elem << ’ ’;     range    operation  } ; cout << endl;  }  The program has the following output:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   520  Chapter 11: STL Algorithms  Instead of a lambda, you could also pass an ordinary function, which is called for each element:  void print  int elem  {  cout << elem << ’ ’;  } ... for_each  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  print ;     range    operation  But note again that since C++11, using a range-based for loop is often more convenient:  The following example demonstrates how to modify each element:  for  auto elem : coll  { cout << elem << ’ ’;  }     algo foreach2.cpp  include "algostuff.hpp" using namespace std;  int main   {  vector  coll;  INSERT_ELEMENTS coll,1,9 ;     add 10 to each element for_each  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  [] int& elem {  elem += 10;  } ;  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll ;     range    operation     add value of ﬁrst element to each element for_each  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  [=] int& elem {  elem += *coll.begin  ;     range    operation  } ;  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll ;  }   11.4 The for_each   Algorithm  521  The program has the following output: 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30  As you can see, you have to declare the elem to be a reference in order to modify it and to deﬁne a capture, such as [=], to be able to add a copy of the ﬁrst element:    range    operation  for_each  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  [=] int& elem {  elem += *coll.begin  ;  If instead you passed a reference to the ﬁrst element with the second call of for_each  :  for_each  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  [&] int& elem {  elem += *coll.begin  ;     range    operation  } ;  } ;  the value to add would change while the elements are processed, which would result in the following output:  11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 22 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41  You could also deﬁne an ordinary function object:     function object that adds the value with which it is initialized template   class AddValue {  private:  public:  T theValue;     value to add     constructor initializes the value to add AddValue  const T& v  : theValue v  { }     the function call for the element adds the value void operator    T& elem  const {  elem += theValue;  }  };  and pass it to for_each  :  for_each  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  AddValue  10  ;  ... for_each  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  AddValue  *coll.begin    ;     range    operation     range    operation   522  Chapter 11: STL Algorithms  The AddValue  class deﬁnes function objects that add a value to each element that is passed to the constructor. See Section 6.10.1, page 237, for more details about this example.  Note also that you can do the same by using the transform   algorithm  see Section 11.6.3,  page 563  in the following way:     add 10 to each element transform  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  coll.begin  , [] int elem {  return elem + 10;  } ;  ...     source range    destination range    operation     add value of ﬁrst element to each element transform  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  coll.begin  , [=] int elem {  } ;  return elem + *coll.begin  ;     source range    destination range    operation  See Section 11.2.2, page 509, for a general comparison between for_each   and transform  .  A third example demonstrates how to use the return value of the for_each   algorithm. Because for_each   has the special property that it returns its operation, you can process and return a result inside the operation:     algo foreach3.cpp  include "algostuff.hpp" using namespace std;     function object to process the mean value class MeanValue {  private:  long num; long sum;  public:     number of elements    sum of all element values     constructor MeanValue    : num 0 , sum 0  { }     function call    - process one more element of the sequence void operator    int elem  {  num++; sum += elem;     increment count    add value  }   11.4 The for_each   Algorithm  523     return mean value  implicit type conversion  operator double   {  return static_cast  sum    static_cast  num ;  }  };  int main   {  vector  coll;  INSERT_ELEMENTS coll,1,8 ;     process and print mean value double mv = for_each  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  cout << "mean value: " << mv << endl;  MeanValue   ;     range    operation  }  The program has the following output:  mean value: 4.5  You could also use a lambda and pass the value to return by reference. However, in this scenario, a lambda is not necessarily better, because a function object really encapsulates both sum as internal state and the ﬁnal division of dividing the sum by the number of elements. See Section 10.1.3, page 482, for details.   524  Chapter 11: STL Algorithms  11.5 Nonmodifying Algorithms  The algorithms presented in this section enable you to access elements without modifying their values or changing their order.  11.5.1 Counting Elements  difference_type count  InputIterator beg, InputIterator end, const T& value   difference_type count_if  InputIterator beg, InputIterator end, UnaryPredicate op    The ﬁrst form counts the elements in the range [beg,end  that are equal to value value.

Associative and unordered containers provide a similar member function, count  , to count the   Complexity: linear  numElems comparisons or calls of op  , respectively . The following example counts elements according to various criteria:  number of elements that have a certain value as key  see Section 8.3.3, page 404 .     algo count1.cpp  include "algostuff.hpp" using namespace std;  int main   {  vector  coll; int num; INSERT_ELEMENTS coll,1,9 ; PRINT_ELEMENTS coll,"coll: " ;     count elements with value 4 num = count  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  4 ;  cout << "number of elements equal to 4:     range    value " << num << endl;   11.5 Nonmodifying Algorithms  525  cout << "number of elements with even value: " << num << endl;     count elements with even value num = count_if  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  [] int elem {  return elem%2==0;  } ;     count elements that are greater than value 4 num = count_if  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  [] int elem {  return elem>4;  } ;     range    criterion     range    criterion  cout << "number of elements greater than 4:  " << num << endl;  }  The program has the following output:  coll: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 number of elements equal to 4: 1 number of elements with even value: 4 number of elements greater than 4: 5  Instead of using a lambda, which checks whether the element is even, you could use binders like the following expression:  std::bind std::logical_not   ,  std::bind std::modulus   ,std::placeholders::_1,2   ;  or even the deprecated expression:  std::not1 std::bind2nd std::modulus   ,2    See Section 10.2.4, page 497, for more details regarding these expressions.  11.5.2 Minimum and Maximum  ForwardIterator min_element  ForwardIterator beg, ForwardIterator end   ForwardIterator min_element  ForwardIterator beg, ForwardIterator end, CompFunc op   ForwardIterator max_element  ForwardIterator beg, ForwardIterator end   ForwardIterator max_element  ForwardIterator beg, ForwardIterator end, CompFunc op    526  Chapter 11: STL Algorithms  pair  minmax_element  ForwardIterator beg, ForwardIterator end   pair  minmax_element  ForwardIterator beg, ForwardIterator end, CompFunc op    These algorithms return the position of the minimum, the maximum element, or a pair of the   The versions without op compare the elements with operator <.   op is used to compare two elements:  minimum and the maximum element in the range [beg,end .  op elem1,elem2   It should return true when the ﬁrst element is less than the second element.    If more than one minimum or maximum element exists, min_element   and max_element   return the ﬁrst found; minmax_element   returns the ﬁrst minimum but the last maximum element, so max_element   and minmax_element   don’t yield the same maximum element.    If the range is empty, the algorithms return beg or a pair .   op should not modify the passed arguments.

The following program prints the minimum and the maximum of the elements in coll, using min_element   and max_element  , as well as minmax_element  , and, by using absLess  , prints the minimum and the maximum of the absolute values:     algo minmax1.cpp  include   include "algostuff.hpp" using namespace std;  bool absLess  int elem1, int elem2  {  return abs elem1  < abs elem2 ;  }  int main   {  deque  coll;  INSERT_ELEMENTS coll,2,6 ; INSERT_ELEMENTS coll,-3,6 ;  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll ;   11.5 Nonmodifying Algorithms  527     process and print minimum and maximum cout << "minimum: "  << *min_element coll.cbegin  ,coll.cend    << endl;  cout << "maximum: "  << *max_element coll.cbegin  ,coll.cend    << endl;     print min and max and their distance using minmax_element   auto mm = minmax_element coll.cbegin  ,coll.cend   ; cout << "min: " << * mm.first  << endl; cout << "max: " << * mm.second  << endl; cout << "distance: " << distance mm.first,mm.second  << endl;     print minimum    print maximum     process and print minimum and maximum of absolute values cout << "minimum of absolute values: "  << *min_element coll.cbegin  ,coll.cend  ,  << endl;  cout << "maximum of absolute values: "  << *max_element coll.cbegin  ,coll.cend  ,  absLess   absLess   << endl;  }  The program has the following output:  2 3 4 5 6 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 minimum: -3 maximum: 6 min: -3 max: 6 distance: 9 minimum of absolute values: 0 maximum of absolute values: 6  Note that the algorithms return the position of the maximum or minimum element, respectively. Thus, you must use the unary operator * to print their values:  auto mm = minmax_element coll.begin  ,coll.end   ; cout << "min: " << * mm.first  << endl; cout << "max: " << * mm.second  << endl;  Note also that minmax_element   yields the last maximum, so the distance  see Section 9.3.3, page 445  is 9. By using max_element  , the distance would be -1.   528  Chapter 11: STL Algorithms  11.5.3 Searching Elements  Search First Matching Element  InputIterator ﬁnd  InputIterator beg, InputIterator end, const T& value   InputIterator ﬁnd_if  InputIterator beg, InputIterator end, UnaryPredicate op   InputIterator ﬁnd_if_not  InputIterator beg, InputIterator end, UnaryPredicate op    The ﬁrst form returns the position of the ﬁrst element in the range [beg,end  that has a value   The second form returns the position of the ﬁrst element in the range [beg,end  for which the  equal to value.  unary predicate  op elem  yields true.  op elem  yields false.

If the range is sorted, you should use the lower_bound  , upper_bound  , equal_range  ,   Associative and unordered containers provide an equivalent member function, find    see Sec- tion 8.3.3, page 405 , which has a better complexity  logarithmic for associative and even con- stant for unordered containers .  or binary_search   algorithms  see Section 11.10, page 608 .    Complexity: linear  at most, numElems comparisons or calls of op  , respectively . The following example demonstrates how to use find   to ﬁnd a subrange starting with the ﬁrst element with value 4 and ending after the second 4, if any:     algo find1.cpp  include "algostuff.hpp" using namespace std;  int main   {  list  coll;   11.5 Nonmodifying Algorithms  529  INSERT_ELEMENTS coll,1,9 ; INSERT_ELEMENTS coll,1,9 ;  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll,"coll: " ;     ﬁnd ﬁrst element with value 4 list ::iterator pos1; pos1 = find  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  4 ;     ﬁnd second element with value 4    - note: continue the search behind the ﬁrst 4  if any  list ::iterator pos2; if  pos1 != coll.end    {  pos2 = find  ++pos1, coll.end  ,  4 ;     range    value     range    value     print all elements from ﬁrst to second 4  both included     - note: now we need the position of the ﬁrst 4 again  if any  if  pos1!=coll.end   && pos2!=coll.end    {  copy  --pos1, ++pos2,  ostream_iterator  cout," "  ;  cout << endl;  }  }  }  To ﬁnd the second 4, you must increment the position of the ﬁrst 4. However, incrementing the end   of a collection results in undeﬁned behavior. Thus, if you are not sure, you should check the return value of find   before you increment it. The program has the following output:  coll: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4  You can call find   twice for the same range but with two different values. However, you have to be careful to use the results as the beginning and the end of a subrange of elements; otherwise, the subrange might not be valid. See Section 6.4.1, page 203, for a discussion of possible problems and for an example.  The following example demonstrates how to use find_if   and find_if_not   to ﬁnd ele-  ments according to very different search criteria:     algo find2.cpp  include "algostuff.hpp" using namespace std; using namespace std::placeholders;   Chapter 11: STL Algorithms  530  int main   {  vector  coll; vector ::iterator pos;  INSERT_ELEMENTS coll,1,9 ; PRINT_ELEMENTS coll,"coll: " ;     ﬁnd ﬁrst element greater than 3 pos = find_if  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  bind greater   ,_1,3  ;     range    criterion     print its position cout << "the "  << distance coll.begin  ,pos  + 1 << ". element is the first greater than 3" << endl;     ﬁnd ﬁrst element divisible by 3 pos = find_if  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  [] int elem {  return elem%3==0;  } ;     print its position cout << "the "  << distance coll.begin  ,pos  + 1 << ". element is the first divisible by 3" << endl;     ﬁnd ﬁrst element not <5 pos = find_if_not  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  cout  =5: " << *pos << endl;  bind less   ,_1,5  ;  }  The ﬁrst call of find_if   uses a simple function object combined with the bind adapter  see Section 10.2.2, page 487  to search for the ﬁrst element that is greater than 3. The second call uses a lambda to ﬁnd the ﬁrst element that is divisible by 3 without remainder.  The program has the following output: coll: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 the 4. element is the first greater than 3 the 3. element is the first divisible by 3 first value >=5: 5  See Section 6.8.2, page 226, for an example that lets find_if   ﬁnd the ﬁrst prime number.   11.5 Nonmodifying Algorithms  531  Search First n Matching Consecutive Elements  ForwardIterator search_n  ForwardIterator beg, ForwardIterator end,  Size count, const T& value   Size count, const T& value, BinaryPredicate op   ForwardIterator search_n  ForwardIterator beg, ForwardIterator end,   The ﬁrst form returns the position of the ﬁrst of count consecutive elements in the range [beg,end    The second form returns the position of the ﬁrst of count consecutive elements in the range  that all have a value equal to value.

Note that op should not change its state during a function call. See Section 10.1.4, page 483, for   op should not modify the passed arguments.   These algorithms were not part of the original STL and were not introduced very carefully. The fact that the second form uses a binary predicate instead of a unary predicate breaks the consistency of the original STL. See the remarks on page 532.    Complexity: linear  at most, numElems*count comparisons or calls of op  , respectively . The following example searches for consecutive elements that have a value equal to 7 or an odd value:     algo searchn1.cpp  include "algostuff.hpp" using namespace std;  int main   {  deque  coll;  coll = { 1, 2, 7, 7, 6, 3, 9, 5, 7, 7, 7, 3, 6 }; PRINT_ELEMENTS coll ;     ﬁnd three consecutive elements with value 7 deque ::iterator pos; pos = search_n  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  3, 7 ;     range    count    value   532  Chapter 11: STL Algorithms     print result if  pos != coll.end    {  cout << "three consecutive elements with value 7 "  << "start with " << distance coll.begin  ,pos  +1 << ". element" << endl;  cout << "no four consecutive elements with value 7 found"  } else {  }  << endl;     ﬁnd four consecutive odd elements pos = search_n  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  4, 0, [] int elem, int value {  return elem%2==1;  } ;     range    count    value    criterion     print result if  pos != coll.end    {  cout << "first four consecutive odd elements are: "; for  int i=0; i<4; ++i, ++pos  {  cout << *pos << ’ ’;  cout   3 found";  }  } else {  } cout << endl;  }  The program has the following output:  1 2 7 7 6 3 9 5 7 7 7 3 6 three consecutive elements with value 7 start with 9. element first four consecutive odd elements are: 3 9 5 7  There is a nasty problem with the second form of search_n  . Consider the second call of search_n  :  pos = search_n  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  4, 0,     range    count    value   11.5 Nonmodifying Algorithms  533  [] int elem, int value {     criterion  return elem%2==1;  } ;  This kind of searching for elements that match a special criterion does not conform to the rest of the STL. Following the usual concepts of the STL, the call should be as follows:  pos = search_n_if  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  4, [] int elem {  return elem%2==1;  } ;     range    count    criterion  However, the algorithm requires a unary predicate, which gets the value passed as fourth argument to search_n   as second parameter.  Unfortunately, nobody noticed this inconsistency when these new algorithms were introduced to the C++98 standard  they were not part of the original STL . At ﬁrst, it seemed that the version with four arguments is more convenient because you could implement something like:     ﬁnd four consecutive elements with value greater than 3 pos = search_n  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  4, 3, greater    ;     range    count    value    criterion  However, as our example demonstrates, it requires a binary predicate even if you need only a unary predicate.  The consequence is that if you have an ordinary unary predicate, such as bool isPrime  int elem ;  you either have to change the signature of your function or write a simple wrapper:  bool binaryIsPrime  int elem1, int  {  return isPrime elem1 ;  } ... pos = search_n  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  4, 0, binaryIsPrime ;     range    count    required dummy value    binary criterion   534  Chapter 11: STL Algorithms  Search First Subrange  ForwardIterator1 search  ForwardIterator1 beg, ForwardIterator1 end,  ForwardIterator2 searchBeg, ForwardIterator2 searchEnd   ForwardIterator1 search  ForwardIterator1 beg, ForwardIterator1 end,  ForwardIterator2 searchBeg, ForwardIterator2 searchEnd, BinaryPredicate op   [searchBeg,searchEnd  in the range [beg,end .

The following example demonstrates the use of find_first_of  :     algo findof1.cpp  include "algostuff.hpp" using namespace std;  int main   {  vector  coll; list  searchcoll;  INSERT_ELEMENTS coll,1,11 ; INSERT_ELEMENTS searchcoll,3,5 ;  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll, " ; PRINT_ELEMENTS searchcoll,"searchcoll: " ;  "coll:     search ﬁrst occurrence of an element of searchcoll in coll vector ::iterator pos; pos = find_first_of  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,     range  searchcoll.begin  , searchcoll.end   ;     beginning of search set    end of search set   540  Chapter 11: STL Algorithms  cout << "first element of searchcoll in coll is element "  << distance coll.begin  ,pos  + 1 << endl;     search last occurrence of an element of searchcoll in coll vector ::reverse_iterator rpos; rpos = find_first_of  coll.rbegin  , coll.rend  ,     range  searchcoll.begin  , searchcoll.end   ;     beginning of search set    end of search set  cout << "last element of searchcoll in coll is element "  << distance coll.begin  ,rpos.base    << endl;  }  The second call uses reverse iterators to ﬁnd the last element that has a value equal to one element in searchcoll. To print the position of the element, base   is called to transform the reverse iterator into an iterator. Thus, you can process the distance from the beginning. Normally, you would have to add 1 to the result of distance   because the ﬁrst element has distance 0 but actually is element 1. However, because base   moves the position of the value to which it refers, you have the same effect  see Section 9.4.1, page 452, for the description of base   .  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11  The program has the following output: coll: searchcoll: 3 4 5 first element of searchcoll in coll is element 3 last element of searchcoll in coll is element 5  Search Two Adjacent, Equal Elements  ForwardIterator adjacent_ﬁnd  ForwardIterator beg, ForwardIterator end   ForwardIterator adjacent_ﬁnd  ForwardIterator beg, ForwardIterator end,   The ﬁrst form returns the ﬁrst element in the range [beg,end  that has a value equal to the value   The second form returns the ﬁrst element in the range [beg,end  for which the binary predicate  of the following element.

The second form uses doubled   to ﬁnd the ﬁrst element for which the successor has the double value.

In that case, the values of the corresponding elements are written to standard output.  The second call searches for the ﬁrst pair of elements in which the element of the ﬁrst collection is greater than the corresponding element of the second collection and returns these elements.

There are two ways to modify elements: 1. Modify them directly while iterating through a sequence. 2. Modify them while copying them from a source range to a destination range. Several modifying algorithms provide both ways of modifying the elements of a range. In this case, the name of the latter uses the _copy sufﬁx.  You can’t use an associative or unordered container as a destination range, because the elements in these containers are constant. If you could, it would be possible to compromise the automatic sorting or the hash based position, respectively.  All algorithms that have a separate destination range return the position after the last copied  element of that range.  11.6.1 Copying Elements  OutputIterator copy  InputIterator sourceBeg, InputIterator sourceEnd,  OutputIterator destBeg   OutputIterator copy_if  InputIterator sourceBeg, InputIterator sourceEnd,  OutputIterator destBeg, UnaryPredicate op   OutputIterator copy_n  InputIterator sourceBeg,  Size num, OutputIterator destBeg   BidirectionalIterator2 copy_backward  BidirectionalIterator1 sourceBeg, BidirectionalIterator1 sourceEnd, BidirectionalIterator2 destEnd     All algorithms copy all elements of a source range  [sourceBeg,sourceEnd  or num elements starting with sourceBeg  into the destination range starting with destBeg or ending with destEnd, respectively.   They return the position after the last copied element in the destination range  the ﬁrst element   For copy  , destBeg should not be part of [sourceBeg,sourceEnd . For copy_if  , source and destination ranges should not overlap. For copy_backward  , destEnd should not be part of  sourceBeg,sourceEnd].  that is not overwritten .   558  Chapter 11: STL Algorithms    copy   iterates forward through the sequence, whereas copy_backward   iterates backward.  This difference matters only if the source and destination ranges overlap. – To copy a subrange to the front, use copy  . Thus, for copy  , destBeg should have a  position in front of sourceBeg.  – To copy a subrange to the back, use copy_backward  . Thus, for copy_backward  ,  destEnd should have a position after sourceEnd.  and move_backward   over and copy_backward    see Section 11.6.2, page 561 .  So, whenever the third argument is an element of the source range speciﬁed by the ﬁrst two arguments, use the other algorithm. Note that switching to the other algorithm means that you switch from passing the beginning of the destination range to passing the end. See page 559 for an example that demonstrates the differences.   The caller must ensure that the destination range is big enough or that insert iterators are used.   See Section 9.4.2, page 454, for the implementation of the copy   algorithm.   Since C++11, if the source elements are no longer used, you should prefer move   over copy     Before C++11, no copy_if   and copy_n   algorithms were provided. To copy only those elements meeting a certain criterion, you had to use remove_copy_if    see Section 11.7.1, page 577  with a negated predicate.   Use reverse_copy   to reverse the order of the elements during the copy  see Section 11.8.1, page 583 . Note that reverse_copy   may be slightly more efﬁcient than using copy   with reverse iterators.   To assign all elements of a container, use the assignment operator if the containers have the same type  see Section 8.4, page 406  or the assign   member function if the containers have different types  see Section 8.4, page 407 .   To remove elements while they are being copied, use remove_copy   and remove_copy_if     To modify elements while they are being copied, use transform    see Section 11.6.3,   Use partition_copy    see Section 11.8.6, page 594  to copy elements into two destination   Complexity: linear  numElems assignments . The following example shows some simple calls of copy    see Section 11.6.2, page 562, for a corresponding version using move   when possible :  page 563  or replace_copy    see Section 11.6.6, page 573 .  ranges: one fulﬁlling and one not fulﬁlling a predicate.   see Section 11.7.1, page 577 .     algo copy1.cpp  include "algostuff.hpp" using namespace std;  int main   {  vector  coll1 = { "Hello", "this", "is", "an", "example" }; list  coll2;   11.6 Modifying Algorithms  559     copy elements of coll1 into coll2    - use back inserter to insert instead of overwrite copy  coll1.cbegin  , coll1.cend  ,  back_inserter coll2  ;     print elements of coll2    - copy elements to cout using an ostream iterator copy  coll2.cbegin  , coll2.cend  ,  ostream_iterator  cout," "  ;  cout << endl;     source range    destination range     source range    destination range     copy elements of coll1 into coll2 in reverse order    - now overwriting copy  coll1.crbegin  , coll1.crend  ,  coll2.begin   ;     source range    destination range     print elements of coll2 again copy  coll2.cbegin  , coll2.cend  ,  ostream_iterator  cout," "  ;     source range    destination range  In this example, back inserters  see Section 9.4.2, page 455  are used to insert the elements into the destination range. Without using inserters, copy   would overwrite the empty collection coll2, resulting in undeﬁned behavior. Similarly, the example uses ostream iterators  see Section 9.4.3, page 460  to use standard output as the destination. The program has the following output:  The following example demonstrates the difference between copy   and copy_backward  :  cout << endl;  }  Hello this is an example example an is this Hello     algo copy2.cpp  include "algostuff.hpp" using namespace std;  int main    {    initialize source collection with ‘‘. ........abcdef..........’’ vector  source 10,’.’ ; for  int c=’a’; c<=’f’; c++  {  source.push_back c ;  } source.insert source.end  ,10,’.’ ; PRINT_ELEMENTS source,"source: " ;   560  Chapter 11: STL Algorithms     copy all letters three elements in front of the ’a’ vector  c1 source.cbegin  ,source.cend   ; copy  c1.cbegin  +10, c1.cbegin  +16,  c1.begin  +7 ;  PRINT_ELEMENTS c1,"c1:  " ;     source range    destination range     copy all letters three elements behind the ’f’ vector  c2 source.cbegin  ,source.cend   ; copy_backward  c2.cbegin  +10, c2.cbegin  +16,  PRINT_ELEMENTS c2,"c2:  c2.begin  +19 ; " ;     source range    destination range  Note that in both calls of copy   and copy_backward  , the third argument is not part of the source range. The program has the following output:  source: . . . . . . . . . . a b c d e f . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . a b c d e f d e f . . . . . . . . . . c1: c2: . . . . . . . . . . a b c a b c d e f . . . . . . .  A third example demonstrates how to use copy   as a data ﬁlter between standard input and standard output. The program reads strings and prints them, each on one line:  }  }     algo copy3.cpp  include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {  copy  istream_iterator  cin ,  istream_iterator   , ostream_iterator  cout,"\n"  ;     beginning of source    end of source    destination   11.6 Modifying Algorithms  561  11.6.2 Moving Elements  OutputIterator move  InputIterator sourceBeg, InputIterator sourceEnd,  OutputIterator destBeg   BidirectionalIterator2 move_backward  BidirectionalIterator1 sourceBeg, BidirectionalIterator1 sourceEnd, BidirectionalIterator2 destEnd     Both algorithms move all elements of the source range [sourceBeg,sourceEnd  into the destina-   Call for each element:  tion range starting with destBeg or ending with destEnd, respectively.  *destElem=std::move *sourceElem   Thus, if the element type provides move semantics, the value of the source elements becomes undeﬁned, so the source element should no longer be used except to reinitialize or assign a new value to it. Otherwise, the elements are copied as with copy   or copy_backward    see Section 11.6.1, page 557 .   They return the position after the last copied element in the destination range  the ﬁrst element   For move  , destBeg should not be part of [sourceBeg,sourceEnd . For move_backward  ,   move   iterates forward through the sequence, whereas move_backward   iterates backward.  destEnd should not be part of  sourceBeg,sourceEnd].  that is not overwritten .  This difference matters only if the source and destination ranges overlap. – To move a subrange to the front, use move  . Thus, for move  , destBeg should have a  position in front of sourceBeg.  – To move a subrange to the back, use move_backward  . Thus, for move_backward  ,  destEnd should have a position after sourceEnd.  So, whenever the third argument is an element of the source range speciﬁed by the ﬁrst two argu- ments, use the other algorithm. Note that switching to the other algorithm means that you switch from passing the beginning of the destination range to passing the end. See Section 11.6.1, page 559, for an example that demonstrates the differences for the corresponding copy algo- rithms.   The caller must ensure that the destination range is big enough or that insert iterators are used.   These algorithms are available since C++11.   Complexity: linear  numElems move assignments . The following example demonstrates some simple calls of move  . It is the improved example of algo copy1.cpp  see Section 11.6.1, page 558 , using move   instead of copy   whenever possible:   562  Chapter 11: STL Algorithms     algo move1.cpp  include "algostuff.hpp" using namespace std;  int main   {  vector  coll1 = { "Hello", "this", "is", "an", "example" }; list  coll2;     copy elements of coll1 into coll2    - use back inserter to insert instead of overwrite    - use copy   because the elements in coll1 are used again copy  coll1.cbegin  , coll1.cend  ,  back_inserter coll2  ;     source range    destination range     print elements of coll2    - copy elements to cout using an ostream iterator    - use move   because these elements in coll2 are not used again move  coll2.cbegin  , coll2.cend  ,  ostream_iterator  cout," "  ;     source range    destination range  cout << endl;     copy elements of coll1 into coll2 in reverse order    - now overwriting  coll2.size   still ﬁts     - use move   because the elements in coll1 are not used again move  coll1.crbegin  , coll1.crend  ,  coll2.begin   ;     source range    destination range     print elements of coll2 again    - use move   because the elements in coll2 are not used again move  coll2.cbegin  , coll2.cend  ,  ostream_iterator  cout," "  ;     source range    destination range  cout << endl;  }  Hello this is an example example an is this Hello  Note that the elements in coll2 have an undeﬁned state after their ﬁrst output because move   is used. However, coll2 still has the size of 5 elements, so we can overwrite these elements with the second call of move  . The program has the following output:   11.6 Modifying Algorithms  563  11.6.3 Transforming and Combining Elements  The transform   algorithms provide two abilities: 1. The ﬁrst form has four arguments. It transforms elements from a source to a destination range.  Thus, this form copies and modiﬁes elements in one step.  2. The second form has ﬁve arguments. It combines elements from two source sequences and writes  the results to a destination range.  Transforming Elements  OutputIterator transform  InputIterator sourceBeg, InputIterator sourceEnd,  OutputIterator destBeg, UnaryFunc op     Calls  op elem   for each element in the source range [sourceBeg,sourceEnd  and writes each result of op to the destination range starting with destBeg:  OP  that is not overwritten with a result .

Thus, as with for_each  , you can use this algorithm to modify elements inside a sequence. See the comparison with the for_each   algorithm  Section 11.2.2, page 509  for this kind of use.   To replace elements matching a criterion with a particular value, use the replace   algorithms   Complexity: linear  numElems calls of op   .

The following example demonstrates how to use swap_ranges  :  the member function usually has constant complexity  see Section 8.4, page 407 .     algo swapranges1.cpp  include "algostuff.hpp" using namespace std;  int main   {  vector  coll1; deque  coll2;  INSERT_ELEMENTS coll1,1,9 ; INSERT_ELEMENTS coll2,11,23 ;   11.6 Modifying Algorithms  567  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll1,"coll1: " ; PRINT_ELEMENTS coll2,"coll2: " ;     swap elements of coll1 with corresponding elements of coll2 deque ::iterator pos; pos = swap_ranges  coll1.begin  , coll1.end  ,  coll2.begin   ;     ﬁrst range    second range  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll1,"\ncoll1: " ; PRINT_ELEMENTS coll2,"coll2: " ; if  pos != coll2.end    {  cout << "first element not modified: "  << *pos << endl;     mirror ﬁrst three with last three elements in coll2 swap_ranges  coll2.begin  , coll2.begin  +3,  coll2.rbegin   ;     ﬁrst range    second range  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll2,"\ncoll2: " ;  }  }  The ﬁrst call of swap_ranges   swaps the elements of coll1 with the corresponding elements of coll2. The remaining elements of coll2 are not modiﬁed. The swap_ranges   algorithm returns the position of the ﬁrst element not modiﬁed. The second call swaps the ﬁrst and the last three elements of coll2. One of the iterators is a reverse iterator, so the elements are mirrored  swapped from outside to inside .

The following program demonstrates how to use generate   and generate_n   to insert or assign some random numbers:     algo generate1.cpp  include   include "algostuff.hpp" using namespace std;  int main   {  list  coll;     insert ﬁve random numbers generate_n  back_inserter coll ,  5, rand ;  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll ;     overwrite with ﬁve new random numbers generate  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  rand ;  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll ;  }     beginning of destination range    count    new value generator     destination range    new value generator  The rand   function is described in Section 17.3, page 942.

The second call shows the behavior of the second form and removes all the consecutive following elements of an element for which the comparison with greater yields true. For example, the ﬁrst 6 is greater than the following 1, 2, 2, 3, and 1, so all these elements are removed. In other words, the predicate is not used to compare an element with its predecessor; the element is compared with the previous element that was not removed  see the following description of unique_copy   for another example .

Instead, it removes all elements that differ by 1 from their previous element that is not removed. For example, after the three occurrences of 6, the following 5, 7, and 5 differ by 1 compared with 6, so they are removed. However, the following two occurrences of 4 remain in the sequence because compared with 6, the difference is not 1.

However, adding the offset to the iterator is possible only when you have random-access iterators, as you have for vectors. Without such iterators, you must use advance    see the example of rotate_copy   on page 586 .  The program has the following output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 coll: one left: 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 two right: 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 4 first: 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3  Rotating Elements While Copying  OutputIterator rotate_copy  ForwardIterator sourceBeg, ForwardIterator newBeg,  ForwardIterator sourceEnd, OutputIterator destBeg    Is a combination of copy   and rotate  .

This has two consequences: 1. You must use advance    see Section 9.3.1, page 441  or next    see Section 9.3.2, page 443   to change the value of the iterator, because bidirectional iterators do not provide operator +.  2. You should use the find   member function instead of the find   algorithm, because the for-  mer has better performance.  The program has the following output:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3  11.8.3 Permuting Elements  bool next_permutation  BidirectionalIterator beg, BidirectionalIterator end  bool next_permutation  BidirectionalIterator beg, BidirectionalIterator end,  BinaryPredicate op   BinaryPredicate op   bool prev_permutation  BidirectionalIterator beg, BidirectionalIterator end  bool prev_permutation  BidirectionalIterator beg, BidirectionalIterator end,   next_permutation   changes the order of the elements in [beg,end  according to the next   prev_permutation   changes the order of the elements in [beg,end  according to the previous   The ﬁrst forms compare the elements by using operator <.

Both algorithms return false if the elements got the “normal”  lexicographical  order: that is, ascending order for next_permutation   and descending order for prev_permutation  . So, to run through all permutations, you have to sort all elements  ascending or descending , and start a loop that calls next_permutation   or prev_permutation   as long as these algorithms return true.3 See Section 11.5.4, page 548, for an explanation of lexicographical sorting.    Complexity: linear  at most, numElems 2 swaps .  3 next_permutation   and prev_permutation   could also be used to sort elements in a range. You just call them for a range as long as they return true. However, doing so would produce really bad performance.   588  Chapter 11: STL Algorithms  The following example demonstrates how next_permutation   and prev_permutation   run through all permutations of the elements:     algo permutation1.cpp  include "algostuff.hpp" using namespace std;  int main   {  vector  coll; INSERT_ELEMENTS coll,1,3 ; PRINT_ELEMENTS coll,"on entry:  " ;     permute elements until they are sorted    - runs through all permutations because the elements are sorted now while  next_permutation coll.begin  ,coll.end     {  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll," " ;  } PRINT_ELEMENTS coll,"afterward: " ;     permute until descending sorted    - this is the next permutation after ascending sorting    - so the loop ends immediately while  prev_permutation coll.begin  ,coll.end     {  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll," " ;  } PRINT_ELEMENTS coll,"now:  " ;     permute elements until they are sorted in descending order    - runs through all permutations because the elements are sorted in descending order now while  prev_permutation coll.begin  ,coll.end     {  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll," " ;  } PRINT_ELEMENTS coll,"afterward: " ;  The program has the following output:  on entry:  1 2 3  }  1 3 2 2 1 3 2 3 1 3 1 2 3 2 1   589  11.8 Mutating Algorithms  afterward: 1 2 3 now: 3 2 1  3 1 2 2 3 1 2 1 3 1 3 2 1 2 3  afterward: 3 2 1  11.8.4 Shufﬂing Elements  Shufﬂing Using the Random-Number Library  void shufﬂe  RandomAccessIterator beg, RandomAccessIterator end,  UniformRandomNumberGenerator&& eng   void random_shufﬂe  RandomAccessIterator beg, RandomAccessIterator end   RandomFunc&& op   void random_shufﬂe  RandomAccessIterator beg, RandomAccessIterator end,   The ﬁrst form, available since C++11, shufﬂes the order of the elements in the range [beg,end , using an engine eng as introduced by the random numbers and distributions library  see Sec- tion 17.1.2, page 912 .

Thus, it should not return max itself.   For shuffle  , you should not pass an engine just temporarily created.

Therefore, function objects provide  ordinary function.   590  Chapter 11: STL Algorithms  a better solution by encapsulating their local states as one or more member variables. For this reason, the algorithms change the state of the passed generator while generating a new random number.  The following example demonstrates how to shufﬂe elements by calling random_shuffle    without passing a random-number generator or by using shuffle  :     algo shuffle1.cpp  include   include "algostuff.hpp" using namespace std;  int main   {  vector  coll;  INSERT_ELEMENTS coll,1,9 ; PRINT_ELEMENTS coll,"coll:  " ;     shufﬂe all elements randomly random_shuffle  coll.begin  , coll.end   ;  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll,"shuffled: " ;     sort them again sort  coll.begin  , coll.end   ; PRINT_ELEMENTS coll,"sorted:  " ;     shufﬂe elements with default engine default_random_engine dre; shuffle  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  dre ;  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll,"shuffled: " ;  }     range    random-number generator  A possible  but not portable  output of the program is as follows:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 coll: shuffled: 8 2 4 9 5 7 3 6 1 sorted: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 shuffled: 8 7 5 6 2 4 9 3 1  See Section 17.1, page 907, for details about engines you can pass to shuffle  .  The following example demonstrates how to shufﬂe elements by using your own random-number  generator passed to random_shuffle  :   11.8 Mutating Algorithms  591     algo randomshuffle1.cpp  include   include "algostuff.hpp" using namespace std;  class MyRandom {  public:  ptrdiff_t operator    ptrdiff_t max  {  double tmp; tmp = static_cast  rand       static_cast  RAND_MAX ;  return static_cast  tmp * max ;  }  };  int main   {  vector  coll;  INSERT_ELEMENTS coll,1,9 ; PRINT_ELEMENTS coll,"coll:  " ;     shufﬂe elements with self-written random-number generator MyRandom rd; random_shuffle  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,     range  rd ;     random-number generator  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll,"shuffled: " ;  }  The call of random   uses the self-written random-number generator rd  , an object of the auxiliary function object class MyRandom, which uses a random-number algorithm that often is better than the usual direct call of rand  .4 Note that before C++11, you couldn’t pass a temporary object as random-number generator:  random_shuffle  coll.begin  , coll.end  ,  MyRandom   ;     ERROR before C++11  Again, a possible but not portable output of the program is as follows:  coll: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 shuffled: 1 8 6 2 4 9 3 7 5  See Section 17.1.1, page 912, for some general comments about the use of rand  .  4 The way MyRandom generates random numbers is introduced and described in [Stroustrup:C++].   592  Chapter 11: STL Algorithms  11.8.5 Moving Elements to the Front  ForwardIterator partition  ForwardIterator beg, ForwardIterator end,  UnaryPredicate op   BidirectionalIterator stable_partition  BidirectionalIterator beg, BidirectionalIterator end,   Both algorithms move all elements in the range [beg,end  to the front, for which the unary  UnaryPredicate op   predicate  op elem  yields true.    Both algorithms return the ﬁrst position for which op   yields false.   The difference between partition   and stable_partition   is that  the algorithm stable_partition   preserves the relative order of elements that match the criterion and those that do not.   You could use this algorithm to split elements into two parts according to a sorting criterion. The nth_element   algorithm has a similar ability. See Section 11.2.2, page 514, for a discussion of the differences between these algorithms and nth_element  .   Note that op should not change its state during a function call.

In addition to full sorting, the STL provides variants of partial sorting. If their result is enough, you should prefer them because they usually have better performance.  Because  forward  lists and associative and unordered containers provide no random-access ite- rators, you can’t use these containers  as a destination  for sorting algorithms. Instead, you might use associative containers to have elements sorted automatically. Note, however, that sorting all elements once is usually faster than keeping them always sorted  see Section 7.12, page 394, for details .  11.9.1 Sorting All Elements  void sort  RandomAccessIterator beg, RandomAccessIterator end   void sort  RandomAccessIterator beg, RandomAccessIterator end, BinaryPredicate op   void stable_sort  RandomAccessIterator beg, RandomAccessIterator end   void stable_sort  RandomAccessIterator beg, RandomAccessIterator end,   The ﬁrst forms of sort   and stable_sort   sort all elements in the range [beg,end  with   The second forms of sort   and stable_sort   sort all elements by using the binary predicate  BinaryPredicate op   operator <.  op elem1,elem2   details.  details .  as the sorting criterion.

See Section 10.1.4, page 483, for   The difference between sort   and stable_sort   is that stable_sort   guarantees that   You can’t call these algorithms for lists or forward lists, because both do not provide random- access iterators. However, they provide a special member function to sort elements: sort    see Section 8.8.1, page 422 .   sort   guarantees a good performance  n-log-n  on average. However, if avoiding worst-case performance is important, you should use partial_sort   or stable_sort  .

See Section 10.1.4, page 483, for   Unlike sort  , partial_sort   does not sort all elements but stops the sorting once the ﬁrst elements up to sortEnd are sorted correctly. Thus, if, after sorting a sequence, you need only the ﬁrst three elements, this algorithm saves time because it does not sort the remaining elements unnecessarily.   If sortEnd is equal to end, partial_sort   sorts the full sequence. It has worse performance than sort   on average but better performance in the worst case.

The following program demonstrates some examples of partial_sort_copy  :  parisons .     algo partialsort2.cpp  include "algostuff.hpp" using namespace std;  int main   {  deque  coll1; vector  coll6 6 ; vector  coll30 30 ;     initialize with 6 elements    initialize with 30 elements  INSERT_ELEMENTS coll1,3,7 ; INSERT_ELEMENTS coll1,2,6 ; INSERT_ELEMENTS coll1,1,5 ; PRINT_ELEMENTS coll1 ;     copy elements of coll1 sorted into coll6 vector ::const_iterator pos6; pos6 = partial_sort_copy  coll1.cbegin  , coll1.cend  ,  coll6.begin  , coll6.end   ;     print all copied elements copy  coll6.cbegin  , pos6,  ostream_iterator  cout," "  ;  cout << endl;     copy elements of coll1 sorted into coll30 vector ::const_iterator pos30; pos30 = partial_sort_copy  coll1.cbegin  , coll1.cend  , coll30.begin  , coll30.end  , greater    ;     print all copied elements copy  coll30.cbegin  , pos30,  ostream_iterator  cout," "  ;   Chapter 11: STL Algorithms  602  }  cout << endl;  The program has the following output:  3 4 5 6 7 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 2 3 3 3 7 6 6 5 5 5 4 4 4 3 3 3 2 2 1  The destination of the ﬁrst call of partial_sort_copy   has only six elements, so the algorithm copies only six elements and returns the end of coll6. The second call of partial_sort_copy   copies all elements of coll1 into coll30, which has enough room for them, and thus all elements are copied and sorted.  11.9.3 Sorting According to the nth Element  void nth_element  RandomAccessIterator beg, RandomAccessIterator nth,  RandomAccessIterator end   RandomAccessIterator end, BinaryPredicate op   void nth_element  RandomAccessIterator beg, RandomAccessIterator nth,   Both forms sort the elements in the range [beg,end , so the correct element is at the nth position, and all elements in front are less than or equal to this element, and all elements that follow are greater than or equal to it. Thus, you get two subsequences separated by the element at position n, whereby each element of the ﬁrst subsequence is less than or equal to each element of the second subsequence. This is helpful if you need only the set of the n highest or lowest elements without having all the elements sorted.    The ﬁrst form uses operator < as the sorting criterion.   The second form uses the binary predicate  op elem1,elem2  as the sorting criterion.  details .    Note that op has to deﬁne a strict weak ordering for the values  see Section 7.7, page 314, for   Note that op should not change its state during a function call.

It is used by heapsort. A heap can be considered a binary tree that is implemented as a sequential collection. Heaps have two properties: 1. The ﬁrst element is always  one of  the largest. 2. You can add or remove an element in logarithmic time. A heap is the ideal way to implement a priority queue: a queue that sorts its elements automatically so that the “next” element always is  one of  the largest. Therefore, the heap algorithms are used by the priority_queue container  see Section 12.3, page 641 . The STL provides four algorithms to handle a heap: 1. make_heap   converts a range of elements into a heap. 2. push_heap   adds one element to the heap. 3. pop_heap   removes the next element from the heap. 4. sort_heap   converts the heap into a sorted collection, after which it is no longer a heap. In addition, since C++11, is_heap   and is_heap_until   are provided to check whether a collection is a heap or to return the ﬁrst element that breaks the property of a collection to be a heap  see Section 11.5.5, page 554 .  As usual, you can pass a binary predicate as the sorting criterion. The default sorting criterion is  operator <.

Example Using Heaps  The following program demonstrates how to use the different heap algorithms:     algo heap1.cpp  include "algostuff.hpp" using namespace std;  int main   {  vector  coll;  INSERT_ELEMENTS coll,3,7 ; INSERT_ELEMENTS coll,5,9 ; INSERT_ELEMENTS coll,1,4 ;  PRINT_ELEMENTS  coll, "on entry:  " ;     convert collection into a heap make_heap  coll.begin  , coll.end   ;  PRINT_ELEMENTS  coll, "after make_heap  :  " ;     pop next element out of the heap pop_heap  coll.begin  , coll.end   ; coll.pop_back  ;  PRINT_ELEMENTS  coll, "after pop_heap  :  " ;     push new element into the heap coll.push_back  17 ; push_heap  coll.begin  , coll.end   ;  PRINT_ELEMENTS  coll, "after push_heap  :  " ;   11.9 Sorting Algorithms  607     convert heap into a sorted collection    - NOTE: after the call it is no longer a heap sort_heap  coll.begin  , coll.end   ;  PRINT_ELEMENTS  coll, "after sort_heap  :  " ;  }  The program has the following output:  on entry: after make_heap  : after pop_heap  : after push_heap  : after sort_heap  :  3 4 5 6 7 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 9 8 6 7 7 5 5 3 6 4 1 2 3 4 8 7 6 7 4 5 5 3 6 4 1 2 3 17 7 8 7 4 5 6 3 6 4 1 2 3 5 1 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6 7 7 8 17  After make_heap  , the elements are sorted as a heap:  9 8 6 7 7 5 5 3 6 4 1 2 3 4  Transform the elements into a binary tree, and you’ll see that the value of each node is less than or equal to its parent node  Figure 11.1 . Both push_heap   and pop_heap   change the elements so that the invariant of this binary tree structure — each node not greater than its parent node — remains stable.  Figure11.1.

These algorithms may have signiﬁcantly better performance than similar algo- rithms for unsorted ranges  usually logarithmic instead of linear complexity . You can use these algorithms with iterators that are not random-access iterators. However, in this case, the algorithms have linear complexity because they have to step through the sequence element-by-element. Never- theless, the number of comparisons may still have logarithmic complexity.  According to the standard, calling these algorithms for sequences that are not sorted on entry results in undeﬁned behavior. However, for most implementations, calling these algorithms also works for unsorted sequences. Nevertheless, to rely on this fact is not portable.  Associative and unordered containers provide special member functions for some of the search-  ing algorithms presented here. When searching for a special value or key, you should use them.  11.10.1 Searching Elements  The following algorithms search certain values in sorted ranges.  Checking Whether One Element Is Present  bool binary_search  ForwardIterator beg, ForwardIterator end, const T& value   op elem1,elem2   BinaryPredicate op   bool binary_search  ForwardIterator beg, ForwardIterator end, const T& value,   Both forms return whether the sorted range [beg,end  contains an element equal to value.   op is an optional binary predicate to be used as the sorting criterion:   To obtain the position of an element for which you are searching, use lower_bound  ,   The caller has to ensure that the ranges are sorted according to the sorting criterion on entry.   Complexity: logarithmic for random-access iterators, linear otherwise  at most, log numElems  + 2 comparisons; but for other than random-access iterators, the number of operations to step through the elements is linear, making the total complexity linear . The following program demonstrates how to use binary_search  :  upper_bound  , or equal_range    see pages 611 and 613 .     algo binarysearch1.cpp  include "algostuff.hpp" using namespace std;   11.10 Sorted-Range Algorithms  609  int main   {  list  coll;  INSERT_ELEMENTS coll,1,9 ; PRINT_ELEMENTS coll ;     check existence of element with value 5 if  binary_search coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  , 5   {  cout << "5 is present" << endl;  cout << "5 is not present" << endl;     check existence of element with value 42 if  binary_search coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  , 42   {  cout << "42 is present" << endl;  cout << "42 is not present" << endl;  } else {  }  }  } else {  }  The program has the following output:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 5 is present 42 is not present  Checking Whether Several Elements Are Present  bool includes  InputIterator1 beg, InputIterator1 end,  InputIterator2 searchBeg, InputIterator2 searchEnd   bool includes  InputIterator1 beg, InputIterator1 end,  InputIterator2 searchBeg, InputIterator2 searchEnd, BinaryPredicate op     Both forms return whether the sorted range [beg,end  contains all elements in the sorted range [searchBeg,searchEnd . That is, for each element in [searchBeg,searchEnd , there must be an equal element in [beg,end . If elements in [searchBeg,searchEnd  are equal, [beg,end  must con- tain the same number of elements. Thus, [searchBeg,searchEnd  must be a subset of [beg,end .   610  Chapter 11: STL Algorithms  op elem1,elem2     op is an optional binary predicate to be used as the sorting criterion:   The caller has to ensure that both ranges are sorted according to the same sorting criterion on   Complexity: linear  at most, 2* numElems+numSearchElems  - 1 comparisons . The following program demonstrates the usage of includes  :  entry.     algo includes1.cpp  include "algostuff.hpp" using namespace std;  int main   {  list  coll; vector  search;  INSERT_ELEMENTS coll,1,9 ; PRINT_ELEMENTS coll,"coll:  " ;  search.push_back 3 ; search.push_back 4 ; search.push_back 7 ; PRINT_ELEMENTS search,"search: " ;     check whether all elements in search are also in coll if  includes  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  search.cbegin  , search.cend     {  cout << "all elements of search are also in coll"  cout << "not all elements of search are also in coll"  } else {  << endl;  << endl;  }  }  The program has the following output:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  coll: search: 3 4 7 all elements of search are also in coll   11.10 Sorted-Range Algorithms  611  Searching First or Last Possible Position  ForwardIterator lower_bound  ForwardIterator beg, ForwardIterator end, const T& value   ForwardIterator lower_bound  ForwardIterator beg, ForwardIterator end, const T& value,  BinaryPredicate op   ForwardIterator upper_bound  ForwardIterator beg, ForwardIterator end, const T& value   BinaryPredicate op   ForwardIterator upper_bound  ForwardIterator beg, ForwardIterator end, const T& value,   lower_bound   returns the position of the ﬁrst element that has a value equal to or greater than value. This is the ﬁrst position where an element with value value could get inserted without breaking the sorting of the range [beg,end .   upper_bound   returns the position of the ﬁrst element that has a value greater than value. This is the last position where an element with value value could get inserted without breaking the sorting of the range [beg,end .    All algorithms return end if there is no such value.   op is an optional binary predicate to be used as the sorting criterion:   The caller has to ensure that the ranges are sorted according to the sorting criterion on entry.   To obtain the result from both lower_bound   and upper_bound  , use equal_range  ,   Associative containers provide equivalent member functions that provide better performance  see   Complexity: logarithmic for random-access iterators, linear otherwise  at most, log numElems  + 1 comparisons; but for other than random-access iterators, the number of operations to step through the elements is linear, making the total complexity linear .  which returns both  see the next algorithm .  Section 8.3.3, page 405 .  op elem1,elem2   The following program demonstrates how to use lower_bound   and upper_bound  :     algo bounds1.cpp  include "algostuff.hpp" using namespace std;  int main   {  list  coll;   612  Chapter 11: STL Algorithms  INSERT_ELEMENTS coll,1,9 ; INSERT_ELEMENTS coll,1,9 ; coll.sort   ; PRINT_ELEMENTS coll ;     print ﬁrst and last position 5 could get inserted auto pos1 = lower_bound  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  auto pos2 = upper_bound  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  cout << "5 could get position "  << distance coll.cbegin  ,pos1  + 1 << " up to " << distance coll.cbegin  ,pos2  + 1 << " without breaking the sorting" << endl;     insert 3 at the ﬁrst possible position without breaking the sorting coll.insert  lower_bound coll.begin  ,coll.end  ,     insert 7 at the last possible position without breaking the sorting coll.insert  upper_bound coll.begin  ,coll.end  ,  5 ;  5 ;  3 ,  7 ,  3 ;  7 ;  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll ;  }  The program has the following output:  1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6 7 7 8 8 9 9 5 could get position 9 up to 11 without breaking the sorting 1 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6 7 7 7 8 8 9 9  pos1 and pos2 have type  list ::const_iterator   11.10 Sorted-Range Algorithms  613  Searching First and Last Possible Positions  pair  equal_range  ForwardIterator beg, ForwardIterator end, const T& value   BinaryPredicate op   make_pair lower_bound ... ,upper_bound ...    pair  equal_range  ForwardIterator beg, ForwardIterator end, const T& value,   Both forms return the range of elements that is equal to value. The range comprises the ﬁrst and the last position an element with value value could get inserted without breaking the sorting of the range [beg,end .   This is equivalent to:   op is an optional binary predicate to be used as the sorting criterion:   The caller has to ensure that the ranges are sorted according to the sorting criterion on entry.

The algorithms process the sum, the union, the intersection, and so on.  Processing the Sum of Two Sorted Sets  OutputIterator merge  InputIterator source1Beg, InputIterator source1End, InputIterator source2Beg, InputIterator source2End, OutputIterator destBeg   OutputIterator merge  InputIterator source1Beg, InputIterator source1End, InputIterator source2Beg, InputIterator source2End, OutputIterator destBeg, BinaryPredicate op     Both forms merge the elements of the sorted source ranges [source1Beg,source1End  and [source2Beg,source2End  so that the destination range starting with destBeg contains all ele- ments that are in the ﬁrst source range plus those that are in the second source range. For example, calling merge   for  1 2 2 4 6 7 7 9  2 2 2 3 6 6 8 9  and  results in  1 2 2 2 2 2 3 4 6 6 6 7 7 8 9 9  element that is not overwritten .    All elements in the destination range are in sorted order.   Both forms return the position after the last copied element in the destination range  the ﬁrst   op is an optional binary predicate to be used as the sorting criterion:   The source ranges are not modiﬁed.  op elem1,elem2    11.10 Sorted-Range Algorithms  615    According to the standard, the caller has to ensure that both source ranges are sorted on entry. However, in most implementations, this algorithm also merges elements of two unsorted source ranges into an unsorted destination range. Nevertheless, for unsorted ranges, you should call copy   twice, instead of merge  , to be portable.   The caller must ensure that the destination range is big enough or that insert iterators are used.   The destination range should not overlap the source ranges.   Lists and forward lists provide a special member function, merge  , to merge the elements of   To ensure that elements that are in both source ranges end up in the destination range only once,   To process only the elements that are in both source ranges, use set_intersection    see   Complexity: linear  at most, numElems1+numElems2-1 comparisons . The following example demonstrates how to use merge  :  two lists  see Section 8.8.1, page 423 .  use set_union    see page 616 .  page 617 .     algo merge1.cpp  include "algostuff.hpp" using namespace std;  int main   {  list  coll1; set  coll2;     ﬁll both collections with some sorted elements INSERT_ELEMENTS coll1,1,6 ; INSERT_ELEMENTS coll2,3,8 ;  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll1,"coll1: PRINT_ELEMENTS coll2,"coll2:  " ; " ;     print merged sequence cout << "merged: "; merge  coll1.cbegin  , coll1.cend  , coll2.cbegin  , coll2.cend  , ostream_iterator  cout," "  ;  cout << endl;  }  The program has the following output:  coll1: coll2: merged: 1 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6 7 8  1 2 3 4 5 6 3 4 5 6 7 8   616  Chapter 11: STL Algorithms  See page 620 for another example. It demonstrates how the various algorithms that are provided to combine sorted sequences differ.  Processing the Union of Two Sorted Sets  OutputIterator set_union  InputIterator source1Beg, InputIterator source1End, InputIterator source2Beg, InputIterator source2End, OutputIterator destBeg   OutputIterator set_union  InputIterator source1Beg, InputIterator source1End, InputIterator source2Beg, InputIterator source2End, OutputIterator destBeg, BinaryPredicate op     Both forms merge the elements of the sorted source ranges [source1Beg,source1End  and [source2Beg,source2End  so that the destination range starting with destBeg contains all ele- ments that are in the ﬁrst source range, in the second source range, or in both. For example, calling set_union   for  1 2 2 4 6 7 7 9  2 2 2 3 6 6 8 9  and  results in  1 2 2 2 3 4 6 6 7 7 8 9  op elem1,elem2   element that is not overwritten .    All elements in the destination range are in sorted order.   Elements that are in both ranges are in the union range only once. However, duplicates are pos- sible if elements occur more than once in one of the source ranges. The number of occurrences of equal elements in the destination range is the maximum of the number of their occurrences in both source ranges.   Both forms return the position after the last copied element in the destination range  the ﬁrst   op is an optional binary predicate to be used as the sorting criterion:   The source ranges are not modiﬁed.   The caller has to ensure that the ranges are sorted according to the sorting criterion on entry.   The caller must ensure that the destination range is big enough or that insert iterators are used.   The destination range should not overlap the source ranges.   To obtain all elements of both source ranges without removing elements that are in both, use   Complexity: linear  at most, 2* numElems1+numElems2  - 1 comparisons .

This example also demonstrates how it differs from other algorithms that combine elements of two sorted sequences.  merge    see page 614 .   11.10 Sorted-Range Algorithms  617  Processing the Intersection of Two Sorted Sets  OutputIterator set_intersection  InputIterator source1Beg, InputIterator source1End, InputIterator source2Beg, InputIterator source2End, OutputIterator destBeg   OutputIterator set_intersection  InputIterator source1Beg, InputIterator source1End, InputIterator source2Beg, InputIterator source2End, OutputIterator destBeg, BinaryPredicate op     Both forms merge the elements of the sorted source ranges [source1Beg,source1End  and [source2Beg,source2End  so that the destination range starting with destBeg contains all ele- ments that are in both source ranges. For example, calling set_intersection   for  1 2 2 4 6 7 7 9  2 2 2 3 6 6 8 9  and  results in  2 2 6 9  op elem1,elem2     All elements in the destination range are in sorted order.   Duplicates are possible if elements occur more than once in both source ranges. The number of occurrences of equal elements in the destination range is the minimum number of their occur- rences in both source ranges.    Both forms return the position after the last merged element in the destination range.   op is an optional binary predicate to be used as the sorting criterion:   The source ranges are not modiﬁed.   The caller has to ensure that the ranges are sorted according to the sorting criterion on entry.   The caller must ensure that the destination range is big enough or that insert iterators are used.   The destination range should not overlap the source ranges.   Complexity: linear  at most, 2* numElems1+numElems2  - 1 comparisons . See page 620 for an example of the use of set_intersection  . This example also demonstrates how it differs from other algorithms that combine elements of two sorted sequences.   618  Chapter 11: STL Algorithms  Processing the Difference of Two Sorted Sets  OutputIterator set_difference  InputIterator source1Beg, InputIterator source1End, InputIterator source2Beg, InputIterator source2End, OutputIterator destBeg   OutputIterator set_difference  InputIterator source1Beg, InputIterator source1End, InputIterator source2Beg, InputIterator source2End, OutputIterator destBeg, BinaryPredicate op     Both forms merge the elements of the sorted source ranges [source1Beg,source1End  and [source2Beg,source2End  so that the destination range starting with destBeg contains all ele- ments that are in the ﬁrst source range but not in the second source range. For example, calling set_difference   for 1 2 2 4 6 7 7 9  2 2 2 3 6 6 8 9  and  results in  1 4 7 7    All elements in the destination range are in sorted order.   Duplicates are possible if elements occur more than once in the ﬁrst source range. The number of occurrences of equal elements in the destination range is the difference between the number of their occurrences in the ﬁrst source range less the number of occurrences in the second source range. If there are more occurrences in the second source range, the number of occurrences in the destination range is zero.    Both forms return the position after the last merged element in the destination range.   op is an optional binary predicate to be used as the sorting criterion:   The source ranges are not modiﬁed.

However, you can process other than numeric values. For example, you can use accumulate   to process the sum of several strings. To use the numeric algorithms, you have to include the header ﬁle  :  include    11.11.1 Processing Results  Computing the Result of One Sequence  T accumulate  InputIterator beg, InputIterator end,  T initValue   T accumulate  InputIterator beg, InputIterator end,   The ﬁrst form computes and returns the sum of initValue and all elements in the range [beg,end .

In particular, it calls the following for each element:  initValue = op initValue,elem     Thus, for the values a1 a2 a3 a4 ...  they compute and return either  initValue + a1 + a2 + a3 + ...  or  respectively.  initValue op a1 op a2 op a3 op ...    If the range is empty  beg==end , both forms return initValue.   op must not modify the passed arguments.   Complexity: linear  numElems calls of operator + or op  , respectively . The following program demonstrates how to use accumulate   to process the sum and the product of all elements of a range:     algo accumulate1.cpp  include "algostuff.hpp" using namespace std;   624  Chapter 11: STL Algorithms  int main   {  vector  coll;  INSERT_ELEMENTS coll,1,9 ; PRINT_ELEMENTS coll ;     process sum of elements cout << "sum: "  << endl;  0      process sum of elements less 100 cout << "sum: "  << endl;  -100      process product of elements cout << "product: "  << accumulate  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  << accumulate  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  << accumulate  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  1, multiplies      << endl;     process product of elements  use 0 as initial value  cout << "product: "  << accumulate  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  0, multiplies      The program has the following output:  << endl;  }  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 sum: 45 sum: -55 product: 362880 product: 0  The last output is 0 because any value multiplied by zero is zero.     range    initial value     range    initial value     range    initial value    operation     range    initial value    operation   11.11 Numeric Algorithms  625  Computing the Inner Product of Two Sequences  T inner_product  InputIterator1 beg1, InputIterator1 end1,  InputIterator2 beg2, T initValue   T inner_product  InputIterator1 beg1, InputIterator1 end1,  InputIterator2 beg2, T initValue, BinaryFunc op1, BinaryFunc op2     The ﬁrst form computes and returns the inner product of initValue and all elements in the range [beg,end  combined with the elements in the range starting with beg2. In particular, it calls the following for all corresponding elements:  initValue = initValue + elem1 * elem2    The second form computes and returns the result of calling op for initValue and all elements in the range [beg,end  combined with the elements in the range starting with beg2. In particular, it calls the following for all corresponding elements:  initValue = op1 initValue,op2 elem1,elem2      Thus, for the values  a1 a2 a3 ... b1 b2 b3 ...  they compute and return either  initValue +  a1 * b1  +  a2 * b2  +  a3 * b3  + ...  initValue op1  a1 op2 b1  op1  a2 op2 b2  op1  a3 op2 b3  op1 ...    If the ﬁrst range is empty  beg1==end1 , both forms return initValue.

Example of Converting Relative Values into Absolute Values  The following example demonstrates how to use partial_sum   and adjacent_difference   to convert a sequence of relative values into a sequence of absolute values, and vice versa:     algo relabs1.cpp  include "algostuff.hpp" using namespace std;  int main   {  vector  coll = { 17, -3, 22, 13, 13, -9 }; PRINT_ELEMENTS coll,"coll:  " ;     convert into relative values adjacent_difference  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  coll.begin   ; PRINT_ELEMENTS coll,"relative: " ;     convert into absolute values partial_sum  coll.cbegin  , coll.cend  ,  coll.begin   ;  PRINT_ELEMENTS coll,"absolute: " ;  }     source    destination     source    destination  The program has the following output: 17 -3 22 13 13 -9  coll: relative: 17 -20 25 -9 0 -22 absolute: 17 -3 22 13 13 -9   Chapter 12 Special Containers  The C++ standard library provides not only the containers for the STL framework but also some containers that ﬁt some special needs and provide simple, almost self-explanatory, interfaces. You can group these containers into either the so-called container adapters, which adapt standard STL containers to ﬁt special needs, or a bitset, which is a containers for bits or Boolean values.  There are three standard container adapters: stacks, queues, and priority queues.  In priority queues, the elements are sorted automatically according to a sorting criterion. Thus, the “next” element of a priority queue is the element with the “highest” value.  A bitset is a bitﬁeld with an arbitrary but ﬁxed number of bits. Note that the C++ standard library It is  also provides a special container with a variable size for Boolean values: vector . described in Section 7.3.6, page 281.  Recent Changes with C++11  C++98 speciﬁed almost all features of the container adapters. Here is a list of the most important features added with C++11:   Container adapters now provide type deﬁnitions for reference and const_reference  see   Container adapters now support move semantics and rvalue references:  Section 12.4.1, page 645 .  – push   provides move semantics now  see Section 12.1.2, page 634, and Section 12.4.4,  page 647 .  – Initial containers can be moved now  see Section 12.4.2, page 646 .    Container adapters provide the emplace   feature, which internally creates a new element ini- tialized by the passed arguments  see Section 12.1.2, page 634, and Section 12.4.4, page 647 .   Container adapters now provide swap    see Section 12.4.4, page 649 .   Constructor adapters now allow you to pass a speciﬁc allocator to their constructors  see Sec-  tion 12.4.2, page 646 .   632  12.1 Stacks  Chapter 12: Special Containers  The class stack  implements a stack  also known as LIFO . With push  , you can insert any number of elements into the stack  Figure 12.1 . With pop  , you can remove the elements in the opposite order in which they were inserted  “last in, ﬁrst out” .  stack  top    pop    push    Figure12.1. InterfaceofaStack  To use a stack, you have to include the header ﬁle  : include    In  , the class stack is deﬁned as follows:  namespace std {  template <typename T,  typename Container = deque > class stack;  }  The ﬁrst template parameter is the type of the elements. The optional second template parameter deﬁnes the container that the stack uses internally for its elements. The default container is a deque. It was chosen because, unlike vectors, deques free their memory when elements are removed and don’t have to copy all elements on reallocation  see Section 7.12, page 392, for a discussion of when to use which container .  For example, the following declaration deﬁnes a stack of integers: std::stack  st;     integer stack  The stack implementation simply maps the operations into appropriate calls of the container that is used internally  Figure 12.2 . You can use any sequence container class that provides the member functions back  , push_back  , and pop_back  . For example, you could also use a vector or a list as the container for the elements:  std::stack > st;     integer stack that uses a vector   12.1 Stacks  633  top    stack  back    pop    push_back    pop_back    container  deque   push    Figure12.2. InternalInterfaceofaStack  12.1.1 The Core Interface  The core interface of stacks is provided by the member functions push  , top  , and pop  :   push   inserts an element into the stack.   top   returns the next element in the stack.   pop   removes an element from the stack. Note that pop   removes the next element but does not return it, whereas top   returns the next element without removing it. Thus, you must always call both functions to process and remove the next element from the stack. This interface is somewhat inconvenient, but it performs better if you want only to remove the next element without processing it. Note that the behavior of top   and pop   is undeﬁned if the stack contains no elements. The member functions size   and empty   are provided to check whether the stack contains elements.  If you don’t like the standard interface of stack , you can easily write a more convenient  interface. See Section 12.1.3, page 635, for an example.  12.1.2 Example of Using Stacks  The following program demonstrates the use of class stack :     contadapt stack1.cpp  include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {   634  Chapter 12: Special Containers  stack  st;     push three elements into the stack st.push 1 ; st.push 2 ; st.push 3 ;     pop and print two elements from the stack cout << st.top   << ’ ’; st.pop  ; cout << st.top   << ’ ’; st.pop  ;     modify top element st.top   = 77;     push two new elements st.push 4 ; st.push 5 ;     pop one element without processing it st.pop  ;     pop and print remaining elements while  !st.empty    {  cout << st.top   << ’ ’; st.pop  ;  } cout << endl;  }  The output of the program is as follows:  3 2 4 77  Note that when using nontrivial element types, you might consider using std::move   to insert elements that are no longer used or emplace   to let the stack internally create the element  both available since C++11 :  stack > st;  auto p = make_pair "hello","world" ; st.push move p  ;     OK, if p is not used any more  st.emplace "nico","josuttis" ;   12.1 Stacks  635  12.1.3 A User-Deﬁned Stack Class  The standard class stack  prefers speed over convenience and safety. This is not what I usually prefer, so I have written my own stack class, which has the following two advantages: 1. pop   returns the next element. 2. pop   and top   throw exceptions when the stack is empty. In addition, I have skipped the members that are not necessary for the ordinary stack user, such as the comparison operations. My stack class is deﬁned as follows:     contadapt Stack.hpp   * ************************************************************ * Stack.hpp * - safer and more convenient stack class * ************************************************************  ifndef STACK_HPP define STACK_HPP  include   include    template   class Stack {  protected:  std::deque  c;     container for the elements     exception class for pop   and top   with empty stack class ReadEmptyStack : public std::exception {  virtual const char* what   const throw   {  return "read empty stack";  public:  public:  }  };     number of elements typename std::deque ::size_type size   const {  return c.size  ;  }  }     is stack empty? bool empty   const { return c.empty  ;   636  Chapter 12: Special Containers     push element into the stack void push  const T& elem  {  c.push_back elem ;  }  }     pop element out of the stack and return its value T pop    {  if  c.empty    {  throw ReadEmptyStack  ;  } T elem c.back   ; c.pop_back  ; return elem;     return value of next element T& top    {  if  c.empty    {  throw ReadEmptyStack  ;  } return c.back  ;  }  };  endif  * STACK_HPP *      contadapt stack2.cpp  include   include   include "Stack.hpp" using namespace std;  int main   {  try {  Stack  st;     push three elements into the stack st.push 1 ; st.push 2 ; st.push 3 ;     use special stack class  With this stack class, the previous stack example could be written as follows:   12.1 Stacks  637     pop and print two elements from the stack cout << st.pop   << ’ ’; cout << st.pop   << ’ ’;     modify top element st.top   = 77;     push two new elements st.push 4 ; st.push 5 ;     pop one element without processing it st.pop  ;     pop and print three elements    - ERROR: one element too many cout << st.pop   << ’ ’; cout << st.pop   << endl; cout << st.pop   << endl;  } catch  const exception& e  {  cerr << "EXCEPTION: " << e.what   << endl;  }  }  The additional ﬁnal call of pop   forces an error. Unlike the standard stack class, this one throws an exception rather than resulting in undeﬁned behavior. The output of the program is as follows:  3 2 4 77 EXCEPTION: read empty stack  12.1.4 Class stack  in Detail  The stack  interface maps more or less directly to corresponding members of the container inter- nally used. For example:  namespace std {  public:  template  > class stack {  typedef typename Container::value_type typedef typename Container::reference typedef typename Container::const_reference const_reference; typedef typename Container::size_type typedef  size_type; container_type;  value_type; reference  Container   638  Chapter 12: Special Containers  protected:  public:  Container c;     container  { return c.empty  ; } { return c.size  ; }  empty   const bool size   const size_type push const value_type& x  { c.push_back x ; } void push value_type&& x  void pop   void value_type& top   const value_type& top   const template   void emplace Args&&... args  {  { c.push_back move x  ; } { c.pop_back  ; } { return c.back  ; } { return c.back  ; }  c.emplace_back std::forward  args ... ; }  void swap  stack& s  ... { swap c,s.c ; } ...  See Section 12.4, page 645, for details of the provided members and operations.  };  }  12.2 Queues  The class queue  implements a queue  also known as FIFO . With push  , you can insert any number of elements  Figure 12.3 . With pop  , you can remove the elements in the same order in which they were inserted  “ﬁrst in, ﬁrst out” . Thus, a queue serves as a classic data buffer.  back    push    queue  front    pop    Figure12.3. InterfaceofaQueue  To use a queue, you must include the header ﬁle  :  include     12.2 Queues  639  In  , the class queue is deﬁned as follows:  namespace std {  template <typename T,  typename Container = deque > class queue;  }  The ﬁrst template parameter is the type of the elements. The optional second template parameter deﬁnes the container that the queue uses internally for its elements. The default container is a deque. For example, the following declaration deﬁnes a queue of strings:  std::queue  buffer;     string queue  The queue implementation simply maps the operations into appropriate calls of the container that is used internally  Figure 12.4 . You can use any sequence container class that provides the member functions front  , back  , push_back  , and pop_front  . For example, you could also use a list as the container for the elements:  std::queue > buffer;  back    front    push    push_back    queue  pop_front    pop    back    front    container  deque   Figure12.4. InternalInterfaceofaQueue  12.2.1 The Core Interface  The core interface of queues is provided by the member functions push  , front  , back   and pop  :   push   inserts an element into the queue.   front   returns the next element in the queue  the element that was inserted ﬁrst .   back   returns the last element in the queue  the element that was inserted last .   pop   removes an element from the queue.   640  Chapter 12: Special Containers  Note that pop   removes the next element but does not return it, whereas front   and back   return the element without removing it. Thus, you must always call front   and pop   to pro- cess and remove the next element from the queue. This interface is somewhat inconvenient, but it performs better if you want to only remove the next element without processing it. Note that the be- havior of front  , back  , and pop   is undeﬁned if the queue contains no elements. The member functions size   and empty   are provided to check whether the queue contains elements.  If you don’t like the standard interface of queue , you can easily write a more convenient  interface. See Section 12.2.3, page 641, for an example.  12.2.2 Example of Using Queues  The following program demonstrates the use of class queue :     contadapt queue1.cpp  include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {  queue  q;     insert three elements into the queue q.push "These " ; q.push "are " ; q.push "more than " ;     read and print two elements from the queue cout << q.front  ; q.pop  ; cout << q.front  ; q.pop  ;     insert two new elements q.push "four " ; q.push "words!" ;     skip one element q.pop  ;     read and print two elements cout << q.front  ;   12.3 Priority Queues  641  q.pop  ; cout << q.front   << endl; q.pop  ;     print number of elements in the queue cout << "number of elements in the queue: " << q.size    << endl;  }  The output of the program is as follows:  These are four words! number of elements in the queue: 0  12.2.3 A User-Deﬁned Queue Class  The standard class queue  prefers speed over convenience and safety. This is not what program- mers always prefer. But you can easily provide your own queue class as explained according to the user-deﬁned stack class  see Section 12.1.3, page 635 . An corresponding example is provided on the Web site of this book in ﬁles contadapt Queue.hpp and contadapt queue2.cpp.  12.2.4 Class queue  in Detail  The queue  interface maps more or less directly to corresponding container members  see Sec- tion 12.1.4, page 637, for the corresponding mapping of class stack  . See Section 12.4, page 645, for details of the provided members and operations.  12.3 Priority Queues  The class priority_queue  implements a queue from which elements are read according to their priority. The interface is similar to queues. That is, push   inserts an element into the queue, whereas top   and pop   access and remove the next element  Figure 12.5 . However, the next element is not the ﬁrst inserted element. Rather, it is the element that has the highest priority. Thus, elements are partially sorted according to their value. As usual, you can provide the sorting criterion as a template parameter. By default, the elements are sorted by using operator < in descending order. Thus, the next element is always the “highest” element. If more than one “highest” element exists, which element comes next is undeﬁned.  Priority queues are deﬁned in the same header ﬁle as ordinary queues,  : include     642  Chapter 12: Special Containers  push    priority queue  top    pop    Figure12.5. InterfaceofaPriorityQueue  In  , the class priority_queue is deﬁned as follows:  namespace std {  template <typename T,  typename Container = vector , typename Compare = less > class priority_queue;  }  The ﬁrst template parameter is the type of the elements. The optional second template parameter deﬁnes the container that the priority queue uses internally for its elements. The default container is a vector. The optional third template parameter deﬁnes the sorting criterion used to ﬁnd the next element with the highest priority. By default, this parameter compares the elements by using operator <. For example, the following declaration deﬁnes a priority queue of floats:  std::priority_queue  pbuffer;     priority queue for ﬂoats  The priority queue implementation simply maps the operations into appropriate calls of the container that is used internally. You can use any sequence container class that provides random-access ite- rators and the member functions front  , push_back  , and pop_back  . Random access is necessary for sorting the elements, which is performed by the heap algorithms of the STL  see Section 11.9.4, page 604 . For example, you could also use a deque as the container for the elements:  std::priority_queue > pbuffer;  To deﬁne your own sorting criterion, you must pass a function, a function object, or a lambda as a binary predicate that is used by the sorting algorithms to compare two elements  for more about sort- ing criteria, see Section 7.7.2, page 316, and Section 10.1.1, page 476 . For example, the following declaration deﬁnes a priority queue with reverse sorting:  std::priority_queue ,  std::greater > pbuffer;  In this priority queue, the next element is always one of the elements with the lowest value.   12.3 Priority Queues  643  12.3.1 The Core Interface  The core interface of priority queues is provided by the member functions push  , top  , and pop  :   push   inserts an element into the priority queue.   top   returns the next element in the priority queue.   pop   removes an element from the priority queue. As for the other container adapters, pop   removes the next element but does not return it, whereas top   returns the next element without removing it. Thus, you must always call both functions to process and remove the next element from the priority queue. And, as usual, the behavior of top   and pop   is undeﬁned if the priority queue contains no elements. If in doubt, you must use the member functions size   and empty  .  12.3.2 Example of Using Priority Queues  The following program demonstrates the use of class priority_queue :     contadapt priorityqueue1.cpp  include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {  priority_queue  q;     insert three elements into the priority queue q.push 66.6 ; q.push 22.2 ; q.push 44.4 ;     read and print two elements cout << q.top   << ’ ’; q.pop  ; cout << q.top   << endl; q.pop  ;     insert three more elements q.push 11.1 ; q.push 55.5 ; q.push 33.3 ;   644  Chapter 12: Special Containers     skip one element q.pop  ;     pop and print remaining elements while  !q.empty    {  cout << q.top   << ’ ’; q.pop  ;  } cout << endl;  }  The output of the program is as follows:  66.6 44.4 33.3 22.2 11.1  As you can see, after 66.6, 22.2, and 44.4 are inserted, the program prints 66.6 and 44.4 as the highest elements. After three other elements are inserted, the priority queue contains the elements 22.2, 11.1, 55.5, and 33.3  in the order of insertion . The next element is skipped simply via a call of pop  , so the ﬁnal loop prints 33.3, 22.2, and 11.1 in that order.  12.3.3 Class priority_queue  in Detail  The priority queue uses the STL’s heap algorithms:  namespace std {  template  ,  typename Compare = less >  class priority_queue {  protected:  Compare comp; Container c;     sorting criterion    container  public:     constructors explicit priority_queue const Compare& cmp = Compare  ,  const Container& cont = Container     : comp cmp , c cont  {  make_heap c.begin  ,c.end  ,comp ;  } void push const value_type& x  {  c.push_back x ; push_heap c.begin  ,c.end  ,comp ;  } void pop   {  pop_heap c.begin  ,c.end  ,comp ;   12.4 Container Adapters in Detail  645  c.pop_back  ;  } bool size_type const value_type& top   const ...  empty   const { return c.empty  ; } size   const  { return c.size  ; } { return c.front  ; }  };  }  These algorithms are described in Section 11.9.4, page 604.  Note that, unlike other container adapters, no comparison operators are deﬁned. See Section 12.4,  page 645, for details of the provided members and operations.  12.4 Container Adapters in Detail  The following subsections describe the members and operations of the container adapters stack , queue , and priority_queue  in detail.  12.4.1 Type Deﬁnitions  contadapt::value_type   The type of the elements.

They are useful to manage sets of ﬂags, where variables may represent any combination of ﬂags. C and old C++ programs usually use type long for arrays of bits and manipulate them with the bit operators, such as &, , and ~. The class bitset has the advantage that bitsets may contain any number of bits, and additional operations are provided. For example, you can assign single bits and can read and write bitsets as a sequence of 0s and 1s.  Note that you can’t change the number of bits in a bitset. The number of bits is the template parameter. If you need a container for a variable number of bits or Boolean values, you can use the class vector   described in Section 7.3.6, page 281 . The class bitset is deﬁned in the header ﬁle  : include    In  , the class bitset is deﬁned as a class template, with the number of bits as the template parameter:  namespace std {  template   class bitset;  }  In this case, the template parameter is not a type but an unsigned integral value  see Section 3.2, page 33, for details about this language feature .  Templates with different template arguments are different types. You can compare and combine  bitsets only with the same number of bits.  Recent Changes with C++11  C++98 speciﬁed almost all features of bitsets. Here is a list of the most important features added with C++11:   Bitsets now can be initialized by string literals  see Section 12.5.1, page 653 .   Conversions to and from numeric values now support type unsigned long long. For this,   Conversions to and from strings now allow you to specify the character interpreted as set and   Member all   is now provided to check whether all bits are set.   To use bitsets in unordered containers, a default hash function is provided  see Section 7.9.2,  to_ullong   was introduced  see Section 12.5.1, page 653 .  unset bit.  page 363 .   12.5 Bitsets  651  12.5.1 Examples of Using Bitsets  Using Bitsets as Sets of Flags  The ﬁrst example demonstrates how to use bitsets to manage a set of ﬂags. Each ﬂag has a value that is deﬁned by an enumeration type. The value of the enumeration type is used as the position of the bit in the bitset. In particular, the bits represent colors. Thus, each enumeration value deﬁnes one color. By using a bitset, you can manage variables that might contain any combination of colors:     contadapt bitset1.cpp  include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {     enumeration type for the bits    - each bit represents a color enum Color { red, yellow, green, blue, white, black, ...,  numColors };     create bitset for all bits colors bitset  usedColors;     set bits for two colors usedColors.set red ; usedColors.set blue ;     print some bitset data cout << "bitfield of used colors: cout << "number of used colors: cout << "bitfield of unused colors: " << ~usedColors << endl;  " << usedColors << endl; " << usedColors.count   << endl;     if any color is used if  usedColors.any    {     loop over all colors for  int c = 0; c < numColors; ++c  {     if the actual color is used if  usedColors[ Color c]  {  ...  }  }  }  }   652  Chapter 12: Special Containers  Using Bitsets for I O with Binary Representation  A useful feature of bitsets is the ability to convert integral values into a sequence of bits, and vice versa. This is done simply by creating a temporary bitset:     contadapt bitset2.cpp  include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {     print some numbers in binary representation cout << "267 as binary short: "   ::digits> 267  << endl;  cout << "267 as binary long:  "   ::digits> 267  << endl;  cout << "10,000,000 with 24 bits: "    1e7  << endl;     write binary representation into string string s = bitset  12345678 .to_string  ; cout << "12,345,678 with 42 bits: " << s << endl;     transform binary representation into integral number cout << "\"1000101011\" as number:  "    "1000101011" .to_ullong   << endl;  }  Depending on the number of bits for short and long long, the program might produce the follow- ing output:  267 as binary short: 267 as binary long: 10,000,000 with 24 bits: 100110001001011010000000 12,345,678 with 42 bits: 000000000000000000101111000110000101001110 "1000101011" as number:  0000000100001011 00000000000000000000000100001011  555   12.5 Bitsets  653  In this example, the following expression converts 267 into a bitset with the number of bits of type unsigned short  see Section 5.3, page 116, for a discussion of numeric limits :  bitset ::digits> 267   The output operator for bitset prints the bits as a sequence of characters 0 and 1.  You can output bitsets directly or use their value as a string: string s = bitset  12345678 .to_string  ;  Note that before C++11, you had to write  string s = bitset  12345678 .to_string ,  allocator  >  ;  here because to_string   is a member template, and there were no default values for the template arguments deﬁned.  Similarly, the following expression converts a sequence of binary characters into a bitset, for  which to_ullong   yields the integral value:  bitset  "1000101011"   Note that the number of bits in the bitset should be smaller than sizeof unsigned long long . The reason is that you get an exception when the value of the bitset can’t be represented as unsigned long long.1  Note also that before C++11, you had to convert the initial value to type string explicitly: bitset  string "1000101011"    12.5.2 Class bitset in Detail  Due to the thickness of this book, the subsection that presents the members of class bitset  in detail this book at http:  www.cppstdlib.com.  is provided as a supplementary chapter on the Web site of  1 Before C++11, to_ulong   is still callable if the number of bits is smaller than sizeof unsigned long .  type unsigned long was not provided, so you could call only to_ulong   here.   This page intentionally left blank    Chapter 13 Strings  This chapter presents the string types of the C++ standard library. It describes the basic class template basic_string  and its standard specializations string, wstring, u16string, and u32string.  Strings can be a source of confusion because it is not clear what the term string means. Does it mean an ordinary character array of type char*  with or without the const qualiﬁer ? Is it an instance of class string ? Or is it a general name for objects that are kinds of strings? In this chapter, I use the term string for objects of one of the string types in the C++ standard library: string, wstring, u16string, or u32string. For “ordinary strings” of type char* or const char*, I use the term C-string.  Note that with C++98 the type of string literals  such as "hello"  was changed into const char*. However, to provide backward compatibility, there is an implicit but deprecated conver- sion to char* for them. Strictly speaking, the original type of a literal such as "hello" is const char[6]. But this type automatically converts  decays  to const char*, so you can almost always use  and see  const char* in declarations. Nevertheless, when working with templates, the differ- ence might matter because for reference template parameters, decay doesn’t occur unless type trait std::decay   is used  see Section 5.4.2, page 132 .  Recent Changes with C++11  page 671  and shrink_to_fit   to shrink capacity  see Section 13.2.5, page 670 .  C++98 speciﬁed almost all features of the string classes. Here is a list of the most important features added with C++11:   Strings now provide front   and back   to access the ﬁrst or last element  see Section 13.2.6,   Strings now provide convenience functions to convert strings to numeric values and vice versa   data   and c_str   no longer invalidate references, iterators, and pointers to strings  see Sec-   Strings now support move semantics  see Section 13.2.9, page 676  and initializer lists  see   see Section 13.2.13, page 681 .  tion 13.2.6, page 672 .  Section 13.2.8, page 675 .   656  Chapter 13: Strings  are predeﬁned now  see Section 13.2.1, page 664 .    Besides string and wstring, the basic_string  specializations u16string and u32string   Strings are now indirectly required to provide an end-of-string character  ’\0’ for string  because for a string s, s[s.length  ] is always valid and s.data   returns the characters including a trailing end-of-string character  see Section 13.1.2, page 662 .   Reference-counted implementations of string classes are no longer supported  see Section  13.2.16, page 692 .  13.1 Purpose of the String Classes  The string classes of the C++ standard library enable you to use strings as normal types that cause no problems for the user. Thus, you can copy, assign, and compare strings as fundamental types without worrying about whether there is enough memory or how long the internal memory is valid. You simply use operators, such as assignment by using =, comparison by using ==, and concatenation by using +. In short, the string types of the C++ standard library are designed to behave as if they were a kind of fundamental data type that does not cause any trouble  at least in principle . Modern data processing is mostly string processing, so this is an important step for programmers coming from C, Fortran, or similar languages in which strings are a source of trouble.  The following sections offer two examples that demonstrate the abilities and uses of the string  classes.  13.1.1 A First Example: Extracting a Temporary Filename  The ﬁrst example program uses command-line arguments to generate temporary ﬁlenames. For example, if you start the program as  string1 prog.dat mydir hello. oops.tmp end.dat  the output is  prog.dat => prog.tmp mydir => mydir.tmp hello. => hello.tmp oops.tmp => oops.xxx end.dat => end.tmp     string string1.cpp  include   include   using namespace std;  Usually, the generated ﬁlename has the extension .tmp, whereas the temporary ﬁlename for a name with the extension .tmp is .xxx.  The program is written in the following way:   13.1 Purpose of the String Classes  657  int main  int argc, char* argv[]  {  string filename, basename, extname, tmpname; const string suffix "tmp" ;     for each command-line argument  which is an ordinary C-string  for  int i=1; i<argc; ++i  {    process argument as ﬁlename filename = argv[i];     search period in ﬁlename string::size_type idx = filename.find ’.’ ; if  idx == string::npos  {     ﬁlename does not contain any period tmpname = filename + ’.’ + suffix;  } else {     split ﬁlename into base name and extension    - base name contains all characters before the period    - extension contains all characters after the period basename = filename.substr 0, idx ; extname = filename.substr idx+1 ; if  extname.empty    {     contains period but no extension: append tmp tmpname = filename; tmpname += suffix;  } else if  extname == suffix  {    replace extension tmp with xxx tmpname = filename; tmpname.replace  idx+1, extname.size  , "xxx" ;     replace any extension with tmp tmpname = filename; tmpname.replace  idx+1, string::npos, suffix ;  } else {  }  }     print ﬁlename and temporary name cout   " << tmpname << endl;  }  }   658  Chapter 13: Strings  At ﬁrst, the header ﬁle for the C++ standard string classes is included:  include    As usual, these classes are declared in namespace std.  The following declaration creates four string variables: string filename, basename, extname, tmpname;  No argument is passed, so the default constructor for string is called for their initialization. The default constructor initializes them as empty strings.  The following declaration creates a constant string suffix that is used in the program as the  normal sufﬁx for temporary ﬁlenames: const string suffix "tmp" ;  The string is initialized by an ordinary C-string, so it has the value tmp. Note that C-strings can be combined with objects of class string in almost any situation in which two strings can be combined. In particular, in the entire program, every occurrence of suffix could be replaced with "tmp" so that a C-string is used directly.  In each iteration of the for loop, the following statement assigns a new value to the string variable  filename:  filename = argv[i];  In this case, the new value is an ordinary C-string. However, it could also be another object of class string or a single character that has type char.  The following statement searches for the ﬁrst occurrence of a period inside the string filename: string::size_type idx = filename.find ’.’ ;  The find   function is one of several functions that search for something inside strings. You could also search backward, for substrings, only in a part of a string, or for more than one character simultaneously. All these ﬁnd functions return an index of the ﬁrst matching position. Yes, the return value is an integer and not an iterator. The usual interface for strings is not based on the concept of the STL. However, some iterator support for strings is provided  see Section 13.2.14, page 684 . The return type of all ﬁnd functions is string::size_type, an unsigned integral type that is deﬁned inside the string class.1 As usual, the index of the ﬁrst character is the value 0. The index of the last character is the value “numberOfCharacters-1.”  If the search fails, a special value is needed to return the failure. That value is npos, which is also deﬁned by the string class. Thus, the following line checks whether the search for the period failed:  if  idx == string::npos   The type and value of npos are a big pitfall for the use of strings. Be very careful that you always use string::size_type, not int or unsigned, for the return type when you want to check the return value of a ﬁnd function. Otherwise, the comparison with string::npos might not work. See Section 13.2.12, page 680, for details.  1 In particular, the size_type of a string depends on the memory model of the string class. See Section 13.3.13, page 715, for details.   13.1 Purpose of the String Classes  659  If the search for the period fails in this example, the ﬁlename has no extension. In this case, the temporary ﬁlename is the concatenation of the original ﬁlename, the period character, and the previously deﬁned extension for temporary ﬁles: tmpname = filename + ’.’ + suffix;  Thus, you can simply use operator + to concatenate two strings. It is also possible to concatenate strings with ordinary C-strings and single characters.  If the period is found, the else part is used. Here, the index of the period is used to split the  ﬁlename into a base part and the extension. This is done by the substr   member function:  basename = filename.substr 0, idx ; extname = filename.substr idx+1 ;  The ﬁrst parameter of the substr   function is the starting index. The optional second argument is the number of characters, not the end index. If the second argument is not used, all remaining characters of the string are returned as a substring.  At all places where an index and a length are used as arguments, strings behave according to the  following two rules: 1. An argument specifying the index must have a valid value. That value must be less than the number of characters of the string  as usual, the index of the ﬁrst character is 0 . In addition, the index of the position after the last character could be used to specify the end.  In most cases, a use of an index greater than the number of characters throws out_of_range. However, all functions that search for a character or a position allow any index. If the index exceeds the number of characters, these functions simply return string::npos  “not found” . 2. An argument specifying the number of characters could have any value. If the size is greater In particular,  than the remaining number of characters, all remaining characters are used. string::npos always works as a synonym for “all remaining characters.” Thus, the following expression throws an exception if the period is not found:  filename.substr filename.find ’.’    But the following expression does not throw an exception:  filename.substr 0, filename.find ’.’    If the period is not found, it results in the whole ﬁlename.  Even if the period is found, the extension that is returned by substr   might be empty because  there are no more characters after the period. This is checked by  If this condition yields true, the generated temporary ﬁlename becomes the ordinary ﬁlename that has the normal extension appended:  Here, operator += is used to append the extension.  The ﬁlename might already have the extension for temporary ﬁles. To check this, operator == is  if  extname.empty     tmpname = filename; tmpname += suffix;  used to compare two strings:  if  extname == suffix    660  Chapter 13: Strings  If this comparison yields true, the normal extension for temporary ﬁles is replaced by the extension xxx:  tmpname = filename; tmpname.replace  idx+1, extname.size  , "xxx" ;  Here, the number of characters of the string extname is returned by  extname.size    Instead of size  , you could use length  , which does exactly the same thing. So, both size   and length   return the number of characters. In particular, size   has nothing to do with the memory that the string uses.2  Next, after all special conditions are considered, normal processing takes place. The program  replaces the whole extension by the ordinary extension for temporary ﬁlenames:  tmpname = filename; tmpname.replace  idx+1, string::npos, suffix ;  Here, string::npos is used as a synonym for “all remaining characters.” Thus, all remaining characters after the period are replaced with suffix. This replacement would also work if the ﬁlename contained a period but no extension. It would simply replace “nothing” with suffix.  The statement that writes the original ﬁlename and the generated temporary ﬁlename shows that  you can print the strings by using the usual output operators of streams  surprise, surprise :  cout   " << tmpname << endl;  13.1.2 A Second Example: Extracting Words and  Printing Them Backward  The second example extracts single words from standard input and prints the characters of each word in reverse order. The words are separated by the usual whitespaces  newline, space, and tab  and by commas, periods, or semicolons:     string string2.cpp  include   include   using namespace std;  int main  int argc, char** argv  {  const string delims " \t,.;" ; string line;  2 In this case, two member functions do the same with respect to the two different design approaches that are merged here: length   returns the length of the string, just as strlen   does for ordinary C-strings, whereas size   is the common member function for the number of elements according to the concept of the STL.   13.1 Purpose of the String Classes  661     for every line read successfully while  getline cin,line   {  string::size_type begIdx, endIdx;     search beginning of the ﬁrst word begIdx = line.find_first_not_of delims ;     while beginning of a word found while  begIdx != string::npos  {     search end of the actual word endIdx = line.find_first_of  delims, begIdx ; if  endIdx == string::npos  {     end of word is end of line endIdx = line.length  ;  }     print characters in reverse order for  int i=endIdx-1; i>=static_cast  begIdx ; --i  {  cout << line[i];  } cout << ’ ’;     search beginning of the next word begIdx = line.find_first_not_of  delims, endIdx ;  } cout << endl;  }  }  In this program, all characters used as word separators are deﬁned in a special string constant:  const string delims " \t,.;" ;  The newline character is also used as a delimiter. However, no special processing is necessary for it because the program reads line by line.  The outer loop runs as far as a line can be read into the string line: string line; while  getline cin,line   {  ...  }  The function getline   is a special function to read input from streams into a string. It reads every character up to the next end-of-line, which by default is the newline character. The line delimiter itself is extracted but not appended. By passing your special line delimiter as an optional third   662  Chapter 13: Strings  character argument, you can use getline   to read token by token, where the tokens are separated by that special delimiter.  Inside the outer loop, the individual words are searched and printed. The ﬁrst statement searches  for the beginning of the ﬁrst word:  begIdx = line.find_first_not_of delims ;  The find_first_not_of   function returns the ﬁrst index of a character that is not part of the passed string argument. Thus, this function returns the position of the ﬁrst character that is not one of the separators in delims. As usual for ﬁnd functions, if no matching index is found, string::npos is returned.  The inner loop iterates as long as the beginning of a word can be found: while  begIdx != string::npos  {  ...  }  }  }  The ﬁrst statement of the inner loop searches for the end of the current word:  endIdx = line.find_first_of  delims, begIdx ;  The find_first_of   function searches for the ﬁrst occurrence of one of the characters passed as the ﬁrst argument. In this case, an optional second argument is used that speciﬁes where to start the search in the string. Thus, the ﬁrst delimiter after the beginning of the word is searched. If no such character is found, the end-of-line is used: if  endIdx == string::npos  {  endIdx = line.length  ;  Here, length   is used, which does the same thing as size  : It returns the number of characters.  In the next statement, all characters of the word are printed in reverse order: for  int i=endIdx-1; i>=static_cast  begIdx ; --i  {  cout << line[i];  Accessing a single character of the string is done with operator [ ]. Note that this operator does not check whether the index of the string is valid. Thus, the programmer has to ensure that the index is valid, as was done here. A safer way to access a character is to use the at   member function. However, such a check costs runtime, so the check is not provided for the usual accessing of characters of a string.  Note that for operator [ ], the number of characters is a valid index, returning a character repre- senting the end of the string. This end-of-string character is initialized by the default constructor of the character type  ’\0’ for class string :3  string s; s[s.length  ]     yields ’\0’  3 Before C++11, for the nonconstant version of operator [ ], the current number of characters was an invalid index. Using it did result in undeﬁned behavior.   13.2 Description of the String Classes  663  Another nasty problem results from using the index of the string. That is, if you omit the cast of begIdx to int, this program might run in an endless loop or might crash. Similar to the ﬁrst example program, the problem is that string::size_type is an unsigned integral type. Without the cast, the signed value i is converted automatically into an unsigned value because it is compared with a unsigned type. In this case, the following expression always yields true if the current word starts at the beginning of the line:  i>=begIdx  The reason is that begIdx is then 0, and any unsigned value is greater than or equal to 0. So, an endless loop results that might get stopped by a crash due to an illegal memory access. For this reason, I don’t like the concept of string::size_type and string::npos. See Section 13.2.12, page 681, for a workaround that is safer, but not perfect.  The last statement of the inner loop reinitializes begIdx to the beginning of the next word, if  any:  begIdx = line.find_first_not_of  delims, endIdx ;  Here, unlike with the ﬁrst call of find_first_not_of   in the example, the end of the previous word is passed as the starting index for the search. If the previous word was the rest of the line, endIdx is the index of the end of the line. This simply means that the search starts from the end of the string, which returns string::npos.  Let’s try this “useful and important” program. Here is some possible input:4 pots & pans I saw a reed deliver no pets nametag on diaper  The output for this input is as follows:  stop & snap I was a deer reviled on step gateman no repaid  13.2.1 String Types  Header File  13.2 Description of the String Classes  All types and functions for strings are deﬁned in the header ﬁle  :  include    As usual, it deﬁnes all identiﬁers in namespace std.  4 Thanks to Sean Okeefe for providing the last two lines.   Chapter 13: Strings  664  }  Inside  , class basic_string  is deﬁned as a basic type for all string types:  Class Template basic_string   namespace std {  template <typename charT,  typename traits = char_traits , typename Allocator = allocator  > class basic_string;  This class is parametrized by the character type, the traits of the character type, and the memory model:   The ﬁrst parameter is the data type of a single character.   The optional second parameter is a traits class, which provides all core operations for the char- acters of the string class. Such a traits class speciﬁes how to copy or to compare characters  see Section 16.1.4, page 853, for details . If it is not speciﬁed, the default traits class according to the current character type is used. See Section 13.2.15, page 689, for a user-deﬁned traits class that lets strings behave in a case-insensitive manner.   The third optional argument deﬁnes the memory model that is used by the string class. As usual, the default value is the default memory model allocator  see Section 4.6, page 57, and Chapter 19 for details .  Concrete String Types  The C++ standard library provides a couple of specializations of class basic_string :   Class string is the predeﬁned specialization of that template for characters of type char:  namespace std {  typedef basic_string  string;    For strings that use wider character sets, such as Unicode or some Asian character sets, three  other types are predeﬁned  u16string and u32string are provided since C++11 :  namespace std {  typedef basic_string  wstring; typedef basic_string  u16string; typedef basic_string  u32string;  }  }  See Chapter 16 for details about internationalization.  In the following sections, no distinction is made between these types of strings. The usage and the problems are the same because all string classes have the same interface. So, “string” means any string type: string, wstring, u16string, and u32string. The examples in this book usually use type string because the European and Anglo-American environments are the common envi- ronments for software development.   13.2 Description of the String Classes  665  Operation constructors destructor =, assign   swap   +=, append  , push_back   insert   erase  , pop_back   clear   resize    replace   + ==, !=,  , >=, compare   Compare strings empty   size  , length   max_size   capacity    Effect Create or copy a string Destroys a string Assign a new value Swaps values between two strings Append characters Inserts characters Deletes characters  pop_back   since C++11  Removes all characters  empties a string  Changes the number of characters  deletes or appends characters at the end  Replaces characters Concatenates strings  Returns whether the string is empty Return the number of characters Returns the maximum possible number of characters Returns the number of characters that can be held without reallocation Reserves memory for a certain number of characters Shrinks the memory for the current number of characters  since C++11  Access a character Access the ﬁrst or last character  since C++11  Read the value from a stream Writes the value to a stream Convert string to signed integral value  since C++11  Convert string to unsigned integral value  since C++11  Convert string to ﬂoating-point value  since C++11  Convert C++11  Copies or writes the contents to a character array Returns the value as C-string or character array Returns a certain substring Search for a certain substring or character Provide normal iterator support Provide constant iterator support  since C++11  Provide reverse iterator support Provide constant reverse iterator support  since C++11  Returns the allocator  integral ﬂoating-point value to string  since  Table13.1.

String Operation Arguments  Many operations are provided to manipulate strings. In particular, the operations that manipulate the value of a string have several overloaded versions that specify the new value with one, two, or three arguments. All these operations use the argument scheme of Table 13.2.  Arguments const string & str const string & str, size_type idx, size_type num  const char* cstr const char* chars, size_type len  Interpretation The whole string str At most, the ﬁrst num characters of str starting with index idx The whole C-string cstr len characters of the character array chars The character c num occurrences of character c  char c size_type num, char c const_iterator beg, const_iterator end All characters in range [beg,end  initlist  All characters in initlist  since C++11   Table13.2. SchemeofStringOperationArguments  Note that only the single-argument version const char* handles the character ’\0’ as a special  character that terminates the string. In all other cases, ’\0’ is not a special character:  std::string s1 "nico" ; std::string s2 "nico",5 ; std::string s3 5,’\0’ ;     initializes s1 with: ’n’ ’i’ ’c’ ’o’    initializes s2 with: ’n’ ’i’ ’c’ ’o’ ’\0’    initializes s3 with: ’\0’ ’\0’ ’\0’ ’\0’ ’\0’  s1.length   s2.length   s3.length       yields 4    yields 5    yields 5  Thus, in general a string might contain any character. In particular, a string might contain the con- tents of a binary ﬁle.  Passing a null pointer as cstr results in undeﬁned behavior. See Table 13.3 for an overview of which operation uses which kind of arguments. All operators can handle only objects as single values.

In fact, they do not provide direct solutions for regular expressions and text processing. Regular expres- sions, however, are covered by a separate library introduced with C++11  see Chapter 14 . For text processing  capitalization, case-insensitive comparisons , see Section 13.2.14, page 684, for some examples.  13.2.3 Constructors and Destructor  Table 13.4 lists all the constructors and the destructor for strings.  You can’t initialize a string with a single character.  Instead, you must use its address or an  additional number of occurrences or the format of an initializer list  since C++11 :  std::string s ’x’ ; std::string s 1,’x’ ; std::string s {’x’} ;     ERROR    OK, creates a string that has one character ’x’    OK, ditto  since C++11   This means that there is an automatic type conversion from type const char* but not from type char to type string.  The initialization by a range that is speciﬁed by iterators is described in Section 13.2.14, page 684.   668  Expression string s string s str   string s rvStr   string s str,stridx   string s cstr  string s chars,charslen   string s num,c  string s beg,end   string s initlist   s.~string    Chapter 13: Strings  Effect Creates the empty string s Copy constructor; creates a string as a copy of the existing string str Move constructor; creates a string and moves the contents of rvStr to it  rvStr has a valid state with undeﬁned value afterward  Creates a string s that is initialized by the characters of string str starting with index stridx  characters of string str starting with index stridx Creates a string s that is initialized by the C-string cstr Creates a string s that is initialized by charslen characters of the character array chars Creates a string that has num occurrences of character c Creates a string that is initialized by all characters of the range [beg,end  Creates a string that is initialized by all characters in initlist  since C++11  Destroys all characters and frees the memory  string s str,stridx,strlen  Creates a string s that is initialized by, at most, strlen  Table13.4. ConstructorsandDestructorofStrings  13.2.4 Strings and C-Strings  In standard C++, the type of string literals was changed from char* to const char*. However, to provide backward compatibility, there is an implicit but deprecated conversion to char* for them. Because string literals don’t have type string, there is a strong relationship between string class objects and ordinary C-strings: You can use ordinary C-strings in almost every situation where strings are combined with other string-like objects  comparing, appending, inserting, etc. . In par- ticular, there is an automatic type conversion from const char* into strings. However, there is no automatic type conversion from a string object to a C-string. This is for safety reasons. It prevents unintended type conversions that result in strange behavior  type char* often has strange behavior  and ambiguities. For example, in an expression that combines a string and a C-string, it would be possible to convert string into char* and vice versa. Instead, there are several ways to create or write copy in a C-string. In particular, c_str   is provided to generate the value of a string as a C-string as a character array that has ’\0’ as its last character. By using copy  , you can copy or write the value to an existing C-string or character array.  Note that strings do not provide a special meaning for the character ’\0’, which is used as a special character in an ordinary C-string to mark the end of the string. The character ’\0’ may be part of a string just like every other character.  Note also that if you use an old-style null pointer  NULL  instead of nullptr  see Section 3.1.1, page 14  or a char* parameter, strange behavior results. The reason is that NULL has an integral type   13.2 Description of the String Classes  669  and is interpreted as the number 0 or the character with value 0 if the operation is overloaded for a single integral type. So you should always use nullptr or char* pointers.  There are three possible ways to convert the contents of the string into a raw array of characters  or C-string: 1. data   and c_str   return the contents of the string as an array of characters. The array includes the end-of-string character at position [size  ], so for strings, the result is a valid C-string including ’\0’.  Note that before C++11, the return type of data   was not a valid C-string, because no ’\0’  character was guaranteed to get appended.  2. copy   copies the contents of the string into a character array provided by the caller. An ’\0’  character is not appended.  Note that data   and c_str   return an array that is owned by the string. Thus, the caller must not modify or free the memory. For example:  std::string s "12345" ;  atoi s.c_str    f s.data  ,s.length     char buffer[100]; s.copy buffer,100 ; s.copy buffer,100,2 ;     convert string into integer    call function for a character array    and the number of characters     copy at most 100 characters of s into buffer    copy at most 100 characters of s into buffer    starting with the third character of s  You usually should use strings in the whole program and convert them into C-strings or character arrays only immediately before you need the contents as type char*. Note that the return value of c_str   and data   is valid only until the next call of a nonconstant member function for the same string:  std::string s; ... foo s.c_str   ;  const char* p; p = s.c_str  ; foo p ; s += "ext"; foo p ;     s.c_str   is valid during the whole statement     p refers to the contents of s as a C-string    OK  p is still valid     invalidates p    ERROR: argument p is not valid  13.2.5 Size and Capacity  To use strings effectively and correctly, you need to understand how the size and capacity of strings cooperate. For strings, three “sizes” exist:   Chapter 13: Strings  670  of the string.5  1. size   and length   are equivalent functions that return the current number of characters  The empty   member function is a shortcut for checking whether the number of characters is zero. Thus, it checks whether the string is empty. Because it might be faster, you should use empty   instead of length   or size  .  2. max_size   returns the maximum number of characters a string may contain. A string typi- cally contains all characters in a single block of memory, so there might be relevant restrictions on PCs. Otherwise, this value usually is the maximum value of the type of the index less one. It is “less one” for two reasons:  a  The maximum value itself is npos, and  b  an implementation might append ’\0’ internally at the end of the internal buffer so that it simply returns that buffer when the string is used as a C-string  for example, by c_str   . Whenever an operation results in a string that has a length greater than max_size  , the class throws length_error.  3. capacity   returns the number of characters a string could contain without having to reallo-  cate its internal memory.  Having sufﬁcient capacity is important for two reasons: 1. Reallocation invalidates all references, pointers, and iterators that refer to characters of the string. 2. Reallocation takes time. Thus, the capacity must be taken into account if a program uses pointers, references, or iterators that refer to a string or to characters of a string, or if speed is a goal.  The member function reserve   is provided to avoid reallocations. reserve   lets you reserve a certain capacity before you really need it to ensure that references are valid as long as the capacity is not exceeded:  std::string s; s.reserve 80 ;     create empty string    reserve memory for 80 characters  The concept of capacity for strings is, in principle, the same as for vector containers  see Sec- tion 7.3.1, page 270 . However, there is one big difference: Unlike with vectors, calling reserve   for strings might be a call to shrink the capacity. Calling reserve   with an argument that is less than the current capacity is, in effect, a nonbinding shrink request. If the argument is less than the current number of characters, it is a nonbinding shrink-to-ﬁt request. Thus, although you might want to shrink the capacity, it is not guaranteed to happen. The default value of reserve   for string is 0. So, a call of reserve   without any argument is always a nonbinding shrink-to-ﬁt request:  s.reserve  ;     ‘‘would like to shrink capacity to ﬁt the current size’’  Since C++11, shrink_to_fit   provides the same effect:  s.shrink_to_fit  ;     ‘‘would like to shrink capacity to ﬁt the current size’’  C++11   A call to shrink capacity is nonbinding because how to reach an optimal performance is implemen- Implementations of the string class might have different design approaches with tation-deﬁned.  5 In this case, two member functions do the same thing because length   returns the length of the string, as strlen   does for ordinary C-strings, whereas size   is the common member function for the number of elements according to the concept of the STL.   13.2 Description of the String Classes  671  respect to speed and memory usage. Therefore, implementations might increase capacity in larger steps and might never shrink the capacity.  The standard, however, speciﬁes that capacity may shrink only because of a call of reserve   or shrink_to_fit  . Thus, it is guaranteed that references, pointers, and iterators remain valid even when characters are deleted or modiﬁed, provided that they refer to characters having a position that is before the manipulated characters.  13.2.6 Element Access  A string allows you to have read or write access to the characters it contains. You can access a single character via the subscript operator [ ] and the at   member function. Since C++11, front   and back   are provided to also access the ﬁrst or last character, respectively.  All these operations return a reference to the character at the position of the passed index, which is a constant character if the string is constant. As usual, the ﬁrst character has index 0, and the last character has index length  -1. However, note the following differences:   Operator [ ] does not check whether the index passed as an argument is valid; at   does. If called with an invalid index, at   throws an out_of_range exception. If operator [ ] is called with an invalid index, the behavior is undeﬁned. The effect might be an illegal memory access that might then cause some nasty side effects or a crash  you’re lucky if the result is a crash, because then you know that you did something wrong .   In general, the position after the last character is valid. Thus, the current number of characters is a valid index. The operator returns the value that is generated by the default constructor of the character type. Thus, for objects of type string it returns the char ’\0’.6   front   is equivalent to [0], which means that for empty strings the character representing the   For at  , the current number of characters is not a valid index.   When called for an empty string, back   results in undeﬁned behavior. For example:  end of the string  ’\0’ for strings  is returned.  const std::string cs "nico" ; std::string s "abcde" ; std::string t;     cs contains: ’n’ ’i’ ’c’ ’o’    s contains: ’a’ ’b’ ’c’ ’d’ ’e’    t contains no character  is empty   s[2] s.at 2  s.front   cs[2] cs.back       yields ’c’ as char&    yields ’c’ as char&    yields ’a’ as char&    yields ’i’ as const char&    yields ’o’ as const char&  6 Before C++11, for the nonconstant version of operator [ ], the current number of characters was an invalid index. Using it did result in undeﬁned behavior.   672  s[100] s.at 100  t.front   t.back    Chapter 13: Strings     ERROR: undeﬁned behavior    throws out_of_range    yields ’\0’    ERROR: undeﬁned behavior  s[s.length  ] cs[cs.length  ] s.at s.length    cs.at cs.length        yields ’\0’  undeﬁned behavior before C++11     yields ’\0’    throws out_of_range    throws out_of_range  To enable you to modify a character of a string, the nonconstant versions of [ ], at  , front  , and back   return a character reference. Note that this reference becomes invalid on reallocation:  std::string s "abcde" ;     s contains: ’a’ ’b’ ’c’ ’d’ ’e’  char& r = s[2]; char* p = &s[3];     reference to third character    pointer to fourth character     OK, s contains: ’a’ ’b’ ’X’ ’d’ ’e’    OK, s contains: ’a’ ’b’ ’X’ ’Y’ ’e’  r = ’X’; *p = ’Y’;  r = ’X’; *p = ’Y’;  s = "new long value";     reallocation invalidates r and p     ERROR: undeﬁned behavior    ERROR: undeﬁned behavior  Here, to avoid runtime errors, you would have had to reserve   enough capacity before r and p were initialized.  References, pointers, and iterators that refer to characters of a string may be invalidated by the  following operations:7   If the value is swapped with swap     If a new value is read by operator>>   or getline     If any nonconstant member function is called, except operator [ ], at  , begin  , end  ,  rbegin  , and rend    See Section 13.2.14, page 684, for details about string iterators.  13.2.7 Comparisons  std::string s1, s2; ...  The usual comparison operators are provided for strings. The operands may be strings or C-strings:  7 Before C++11, data   and c_str   also could invalidate references, iterators, and pointers to strings.   13.2 Description of the String Classes  673  s1 == s2 s1 < "hello"     returns true if s1 and s2 contain the same characters    return whether s1 is less than the C-string "hello"  If strings are compared by  , or >=, their characters are compared lexicographically according to the current character traits. For example, all of the following comparisons yield true:  std::string "aaaa"  < std::string "bbbb"  std::string "aaaa"  < std::string "abba"  std::string "aaaa"  < std::string "aaaaaa"   By using the compare   member functions, you can compare substrings. The compare   member functions can process more than one argument for each string, so you can specify a substring by its index and its length. Note that compare   returns an integral value rather than a Boolean value. This return value has the following meaning: 0 means equal, a value less than 0 means less than, and a value greater than 0 means greater than. For example:  std::string s "abcd" ;  s.compare "abcd"  s.compare "dcba"  s.compare "ab"      returns 0    returns a value < 0  s is less     returns a value > 0  s is greater   s.compare s  s.compare 0,2,s,2,2  s.compare 1,2,"bcx",2      returns 0  s is equal to s     returns a value < 0  "ab" is less than "cd"     returns 0  "bc" is equal to "bc"   To use a different comparison criterion, you can deﬁne your own comparison criterion and use STL comparison algorithms  see Section 13.2.14, page 684, for an example , or you can use special character traits that make comparisons on a case-insensitive basis. However, because a string type that has a special traits class is a different data type, you cannot combine or process these strings with objects of type string. See Section 13.2.15, page 689, for an example.  In programs for the international market, it might be necessary to compare strings according to a speciﬁc locale. Class locale provides the parenthesis operator as a convenient way to do this  see Section 16.3, page 868 . It uses the string collation facet, which is provided to compare strings for sorting according to some locale conventions. See Section 16.4.5, page 904, for details.  13.2.8 Modiﬁers  Assignments  You can modify strings by using different member functions and operators.  To modify a string, you can use operator = to assign a new value. The assigned value may be a string, a C-string, or a single character. In addition, you can use the assign   member functions to assign strings when more than one argument is needed to describe the new value. For example:  const std::string aString "othello" ; std::string s;   674  Chapter 13: Strings  s = aString; s = "two\nlines"; s = ’ ’;     assign "othello"    assign a C-string    assign a single character  s.assign aString ; s.assign aString,1,3 ; s.assign aString,2,std::string::npos ;     assign "othello"  equivalent to operator =     assign "the"     assign "hello"  s.assign "two\nlines" ;    assign a C-string  equivalent to operator =  s.assign "nico",5 ; s.assign 5,’x’ ;     assign the character array: ’n’ ’i’ ’c’ ’o’ ’\0’    assign ﬁve characters: ’x’ ’x’ ’x’ ’x’ ’x’  You also can assign a range of characters that is deﬁned by two iterators. See Section 13.2.14, page 684, for details.  Swapping Values  As with many nontrivial types, the string type provides a specialization of the swap   function, which swaps the contents of two strings  the global swap   function was introduced in Section 5.5.2, page 136 . The specialization of swap   for strings guarantees constant complexity, so you should use it to swap the value of strings and to assign strings if you don’t need the assigned string after the assignment.  Making Strings Empty  std::string s;  To remove all characters in a string, you have several possibilities. For example:  s = ""; s.clear  ; s.erase  ;     assign the empty string    clear contents    erase all characters  Inserting and Removing Characters  There are numerous member functions to insert, remove, replace, and erase characters of a string. To append characters, you can use operator +=, append  , and push_back  . For example:  const std::string aString "othello" ; std::string s;  s += aString; s += "two\nlines"; s += ’\n’; s += { ’o’, ’k’ };     append "othello"    append C-string    append single character    append an initializer list of characters  since C++11    13.2 Description of the String Classes  675  s.append aString ; s.append aString,1,3 ; s.append aString,2,std::string::npos ;     append "othello"  equivalent to operator +=     append "the"     append "hello"  s.append "two\nlines" ;    append C-string  equivalent to operator +=  s.append "nico",5 ; s.append 5,’x’ ;     append character array: ’n’ ’i’ ’c’ ’o’ ’\0’    append ﬁve characters: ’x’ ’x’ ’x’ ’x’ ’x’     append single character  equivalent to operator +=   s.push_back ’\n’ ; Operator += appends single-argument values, including initializer lists of characters since C++11. append   is overloaded for different arguments. One version of append   lets you append a range of characters speciﬁed by two iterators  see Section 13.2.14, page 684 . The push_back   member function is provided for back inserters so that STL algorithms are able to append characters to a string  see Section 9.4.2, page 455, for details about back inserters and Section 13.2.14, page 688, for an example of their use with strings .  Similar to append  , several insert   member functions enable you to insert characters. These functions require the index of the character, after which the new characters are inserted:  const std::string aString "age" ; std::string s "p" ;  s.insert 1,aString ; s.insert 1,"ersifl" ;     s: page    s: persiflage  s.insert 0,’ ’ ; s.insert 0," " ;     ERROR    OK  You might also try  s.insert 0,1,’ ’ ;     ERROR: ambiguous  Note that no insert   member function is provided to pass the index and a single character. Thus, you must pass a string or an additional number:  However, this results in a nasty ambiguity because insert   is overloaded for the following signatures:  insert  size_type idx, size_type num, charT c ; insert  iterator pos, size_type num, charT c ;     position is index    position is iterator  For type string, size_type is usually deﬁned as unsigned, and iterator is often deﬁned as char*. In this case, the ﬁrst argument 0 has two equivalent conversions. So, to get the correct behavior, you have to write:  s.insert  std::string::size_type 0,1,’ ’ ;     OK  The second interpretation of the ambiguity described here is an example of the use of iterators to insert characters. If you wish to specify the insert position as an iterator, you can do it in three ways: insert a single character, insert a certain number of the same character, and insert a range of characters speciﬁed by two iterators  see Section 13.2.14, page 684 .   676  Chapter 13: Strings  Similar to append   and insert  , several erase   functions and pop_back    since C++11   remove characters, and several replace   functions replace characters. For example:  std::string s = "i18n"; s.replace 1,2,"nternationalizatio" ; s.erase 13 ; s.erase 7,5 ; s.pop_back  ; s.replace 0,2,"ex" ;     s: i18n    s: internationalization    s: international    s: internal    s: interna  since C++11     s: externa  You can use resize   to change the number of characters. If the new size that is passed as an argument is less than the current number of characters, characters are removed from the end. If the new size is greater than the current number of characters, characters are appended at the end. You can pass the character that is appended if the size of the string grows. If you don’t, the default constructor for the character type is used  which is the ’\0’ character for type char .  13.2.9 Substrings and String Concatenation  You can extract a substring from any string by using the substr   member function. For example:  std::string s "interchangeability" ;  s.substr   s.substr 11  s.substr 5,6  s.substr s.find ’c’       returns a copy of s    returns string "ability"     returns string "change"     returns string "changeability"   You can use operator + to concatenate two strings or C-strings or one of those with single characters For example, the statements  std::string s1 "enter" ; std::string s2 "nation" ; std::string i18n;  i18n = ’i’ + s1.substr 1  + s2 + "aliz" + s2.substr 1 ; std::cout << "i18n means: " + i18n << std::endl;  have the following output:  i18n means: internationalization  Since C++11, operator + is also overloaded for strings that are rvalue references to support the move semantics. Thus, if a string argument passed to operator + is no longer needed afterward, you should use move   to pass it to the operator. For example:  string foo   {  std::string s1 "international" ; std::string s2 "ization" ;   13.2 Description of the String Classes  677  std::string s = std::move s1  + std::move s2 ;     OK     s1 and s2 have valid state with unspeciﬁed value  return s;  }  13.2.10 Input Output Operators  The usual I O operators are deﬁned for strings:   Operator >> reads a string from an input stream.   Operator << writes a string to an output stream. These operators behave as they do for ordinary C-strings. In particular, operator >> operates as follows: 1. 2.  It skips leading whitespaces if the skipws ﬂag  see Section 15.7.7, page 789  is set. It reads all characters until any of the following happens: – The next character is a whitespace. – The stream is no longer in a good state  for example, due to end-of-ﬁle . – The current width   of the stream  see Section 15.7.3, page 781  is greater than 0, and  width   characters are read.  – max_size   characters are read. It sets width   of the stream to 0.  3. Thus, in general, the input operator reads the next word while skipping leading whitespaces. A whitespace is any character for which isspace c,strm.getloc    is true  isspace   is ex- plained in Section 16.4.4, page 895 .  The output operator also takes the width   of the stream into consideration. That is, if width    is greater than 0, operator << writes at least width   characters.  Note also that since C++11, operators  > are declared to process rvalue references to streams. This, for example, allows you to use temporary string streams  see Section 15.10.2, page 806, for details .  getline    The string classes also provide a special convenience function std::getline   for reading line by line: This function reads all characters, including leading whitespaces, until the line delimiter or end-of-ﬁle is reached. The line delimiter is extracted but not appended. By default, the line delimiter is the newline character, but you can pass your own “line” delimiter as an optional argument.8 This way, you can read token by token, separated by any arbitrary character:  std::string s;  8 You don’t have to qualify getline   with std:: because when calling a function argument dependent lookup  ADL, also known as Koenig lookup  will always consider the namespace where the class of an argument was deﬁned.   678  ...  ...  }  }  ...  }  Chapter 13: Strings  while  getline std::cin,s   {     for each line read from cin  while  getline std::cin,s,’:’   {     for each token separated by ’:’  Note that if you read token by token, the newline character is not a special character. In this case, the tokens might contain a newline character.  Note also that since C++11, getline   is overloaded for both lvalue and rvalue stream refer-  ences, which allows using temporary string streams:  void process  const std::string& filecontents  {     process ﬁrst line of passed string: std::string firstLine; std::getline std::stringstream filecontents ,  firstLine ;     OK since C++11  See Section 15.10, page 802, for details about string streams.  13.2.11 Searching and Finding  The C++ standard library provides many abilities to search and ﬁnd characters or substrings in a string:9   By using member functions, you can search  – A single character, a character sequence  substring , or one of a certain set of characters – Forward and backward – Starting from any position at the beginning or inside the string  character sequences. See Section 13.2.14, page 687, for an example.    By using the regex library  see Chapter 14 , you can search for more complicated patterns of   By using STL algorithms, you can also search for single characters or speciﬁc character se- quences  see Section 11.2.2, page 507 . Note that these algorithms allow you to use your own comparison criterion  see Section 13.2.14, page 684, for an example .  9 Don’t be confused because I write about searching “and” ﬁnding. They are almost synonymous. The search functions use “ﬁnd” in their names. However, unfortunately, they don’t guarantee to ﬁnd anything. In fact, they “search” for something or “try to ﬁnd” something. So I use the term search for the behavior of these functions and ﬁnd with respect to their names.   13.2 Description of the String Classes  679  Member Functions for Searching and Finding  All search functions have the word ﬁnd inside their name. They try to ﬁnd a character position given a value that is passed as an argument. How the search proceeds depends on the exact name of the ﬁnd function. Table 13.5 lists all the search functions for strings.  String Function find   rfind   find_first_of   find_last_of   find_first_not_of   find_last_not_of    Effect Finds the ﬁrst occurrence of value Finds the last occurrence of value  reverse ﬁnd  Finds the ﬁrst character that is part of value Finds the last character that is part of value Finds the ﬁrst character that is not part of value Finds the last character that is not part of value  Table13.5. SearchFunctionsforStrings  All search functions return the index of the ﬁrst character of the character sequence that matches the search. If the search fails, they return npos. The search functions use the following argument scheme:   The ﬁrst argument is always the value that is searched for.   The second optional value indicates an index at which to start the search in the string.   The optional third argument is the number of characters of the value to search. Unfortunately, this argument scheme differs from that of the other string functions. With the other string functions, the starting index is the ﬁrst argument, and the value and its length are adjacent arguments. In particular, each search function is overloaded with the following set of arguments:   const string& value   const string& value, size_type idx   const char* value   const char* value, size_type idx   const char* value, size_type idx, size_type value_len  searches against the characters of the C-string value, starting with index idx in *this.  searches against the characters of value, starting with index idx in *this.  searches against the characters of the C-string value.  searches against the characters of the string value.  searches against the value_len characters of the character array value, starting with index idx in *this. Thus, the null character  ’\0’  has no special meaning here inside value.    const char value   const char value, size_type idx  searches against the character value.  searches against the characters value, starting with index idx in *this.  For example:   680  Chapter 13: Strings  std::string s "Hi Bill, I’m ill, so please pay the bill" ;  s.find "il"  s.find "il",10  s.rfind "il"  s.find_first_of "il"  s.find_last_of "il"  s.find_first_not_of "il"  s.find_last_not_of "il"  s.find "hi"      returns 4  ﬁrst substring "il"     returns 13  ﬁrst substring "il" starting from s[10]     returns 37  last substring "il"     returns 1  ﬁrst char ’i’ or ’l’     returns 39  last char ’i’ or ’l’     returns 0  ﬁrst char neither ’i’ nor ’l’     returns 36  last char neither ’i’ nor ’l’     returns npos  Note that the naming scheme of the STL search algorithms differs from that for string search func- tions  see Section 11.2.2, page 507, for details .  If a search function fails, it returns string::npos. Consider the following example:     be careful: don’t use any other type!  13.2.12 The Value npos  std::string s; std::string::size_type idx; ... idx = s.find "substring" ; if  idx == std::string::npos  {  ...  }  The condition of the if statement yields true if and only if "substring" is not part of string s.  Be very careful when using the string value npos and its type. When you want to check the return value, always use string::size_type, not int or unsigned for the type of the return value; otherwise, the comparison of the return value with string::npos might not work. This behavior is the result of the design decision that npos is deﬁned as -1:  namespace std {  template <typename charT,  typename traits = char_traits , typename Allocator = allocator  >  class basic_string {  public:  typedef typename Allocator::size_type size_type; ... static const size_type npos = -1; ...  };  }   13.2 Description of the String Classes  681  Unfortunately, size_type, which is deﬁned by the allocator of the string, must be an unsigned integral type. The default allocator, allocator, uses type size_t as size_type. Because -1 is converted into an unsigned integral type, npos is the maximum unsigned value of its type. However, the exact value depends on the exact deﬁnition of type size_type. Unfortunately, these maximum values differ. In fact,  unsigned long -1 differs from  unsigned short -1 if the size of the types differs. Thus, the comparison idx == std::string::npos  might yield false if idx has the value -1 and idx and string::npos have different types:  std::string s; ... int idx = s.find "not found" ; if  idx == std::string::npos  {     assume it returns npos    ERROR: comparison might not work  One way to avoid this error is to check whether the search fails directly:  if  s.find "hi"  == std::string::npos  {  However, often you need the index of the matching character position. Thus, another simple solution is to deﬁne your own signed value for npos:  const int NPOS = -1;  Now the comparison looks a bit different and even more convenient:  if  idx == NPOS  {     works almost always  Unfortunately, this solution is not perfect, because the comparison fails if either idx has type unsigned short or the index is greater than the maximum value of int. Because of these prob- lems, the standard did not deﬁne it that way. However, because both might happen very rarely, the solution works in most situations. To write portable code, however, you should always use string::size_type for any index of your string type. For a perfect solution, you’d need some over- loaded functions that consider the exact type of string::size_type. I still hope the standard will provide a better solution in the future  although with C++11 nothing changed .  13.2.13 Numeric Conversions  Since C++11, the C++ standard library provides convenience functions to convert strings into nu- meric values or to convert numeric values to strings  see Table 13.6 . Note, however, that these conversions are available only for types string and wstring, not u16string and u32string.  ...  ...  ...  }  }  }   682  Chapter 13: Strings  Effect Converts str to an int Converts str to a long Converts str to an unsigned long Converts str to a long long  String Function stoi str,idxRet=nullptr, base=10  stol str,idxRet=nullptr, base=10  stoul str,idxRet=nullptr, base=10  stoll str,idxRet=nullptr, base=10  stoull str,idxRet=nullptr, base=10  Converts str to an unsigned long long stof str,idxRet=nullptr  stod str,idxRet=nullptr  stold str,idxRet=nullptr  to_string val  to_wstring val   Converts str to a float Converts str to a double Converts str to a long double Converts val to a string Converts val to a wstring  Table13.6.

They allow you to return the index of the ﬁrst character after the last processed character.   They might possible  and std::out_of_range if the converted value is outside the range of representable values for the return type.    For integral values, you can optionally pass the number base to use.

Note that std::stol "789",&idx,8  parses only the ﬁrst character of the string because 8 is not a valid character for octal numbers.   684  Chapter 13: Strings  13.2.14 Iterator Support for Strings  A string is an ordered collection of characters. As a consequence, the C++ standard library provides an interface for strings that lets you use them as STL containers.10  In particular, you can call the usual member functions to get iterators that iterate over the char- acters of a string. If you are not familiar with iterators, consider them as something that can refer to a single character inside a string, just as ordinary pointers do for C-strings. By using these objects, you can iterate over all characters of a string by calling several algorithms that either are provided by the C++ standard library or are user deﬁned. For example, you can sort the characters of a string, reverse the order, or ﬁnd the character that has the maximum value.  String iterators are random-access iterators. This means that they provide random access, and you can use all algorithms  see Section 6.3.2, page 198, and Section 9.2, page 433, for a discussion about iterator categories . As usual, the types of string iterators  iterator, const_iterator, and so on  are deﬁned by the string class itself. The exact type is implementation deﬁned, but string iterators are often deﬁned simply as ordinary pointers. See Section 9.2.6, page 440, for a nasty difference between iterators that are implemented as pointers and iterators that are implemented as classes.  Iterators are invalidated when reallocation occurs or when certain changes are made to the values  to which they refer. See Section 13.2.6, page 672, for details.  Iterator Functions for Strings  Table 13.7 shows all the member functions that strings provide for iterators. As usual, the range spec- iﬁed by beg and end is a half-open range that includes beg but excludes end, written as [beg,end   see Section 6.3, page 188 .  To support the use of back inserters for strings, the push_back   function is deﬁned. See Section 9.4.2, page 455, for details about back inserters and page 688 for an example of their use with strings.  A very useful thing that you can do with string iterators is to make all characters of a string lowercase or uppercase via a single statement. For example:  Example of Using String Iterators     string stringiter1.cpp  include   include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  10 The STL is introduced in Chapter 6.   13.2 Description of the String Classes  685  Expression s.begin  , s.cbegin   s.end  , s.cend    s.rbegin  , s.crbegin    s.rend  , crend    string s beg,end   s.append beg,end  s.assign beg,end  s.insert pos,c   s.insert pos,num,c   s.insert pos,beg,end   s.insert pos,initlist   s.erase pos   s.erase beg,end   s.replace beg,end,str   s.replace beg,end,cstr   s.replace beg,end,num,c   s.replace beg,end,  newBeg,newEnd   s.replace beg,end,  initlist   Effect Returns a random-access iterator for the ﬁrst character Returns a random-access iterator for the position after the last character Returns a reverse iterator for the ﬁrst character of a reverse iteration  thus, for the last character  Returns a reverse iterator for the position after the last character of a reverse iteration  thus, the position before the ﬁrst character  Creates a string that is initialized by all characters of the range [beg,end  Appends all characters of the range [beg,end  Assigns all characters of the range [beg,end  Inserts the character c at iterator position pos and returns the iterator position of the new character Inserts num occurrences of the character c at iterator position pos and returns the iterator position of the ﬁrst new character Inserts all characters of the range [beg,end  at iterator position pos Inserts all characters of the initializer list initlist at iterator position pos  since C++11  Deletes the character to which iterator pos refers and returns the position of the next character Deletes all characters of the range [beg,end  and returns the next position of the next character Replaces all characters of the range [beg,end  with the characters of string str Replaces all characters of the range [beg,end  with the characters of the C-string cstr  characters of the character array cstr Replaces all characters of the range [beg,end  with num occurrences of the character c Replaces all characters of the range [beg,end  with all characters of the range [newBeg,newEnd  Replaces all characters of the range [beg,end  with the values of the initializer list initlist  since C++11   s.replace beg,end,cstr,len  Replaces all characters of the range [beg,end  with len  Table13.7. IteratorOperationsofStrings   686  int main   {  Chapter 13: Strings     create a string string s "The zip code of Braunschweig in Germany is 38100" ; cout << "original: " << s << endl;     lowercase all characters transform  s.cbegin  , s.cend  ,  s.begin  , []  char c  {  return tolower c ;     source    destination    operation  cout << "lowered:  " << s << endl;     uppercase all characters transform  s.cbegin  , s.cend  ,  s.begin  , []  char c  {  return toupper c ;     source    destination    operation  } ;  } ;  cout << "uppered:  " << s << endl;     search case-insensitive for Germany string g "Germany" ; string::const_iterator pos; pos = search  s.cbegin  ,s.cend  , g.cbegin  ,g.cend  , []  char c1, char c2  {     source string in which to search    substring to search    comparison criterion  return toupper c1  == toupper c2 ;  } ;  if  pos != s.cend    {  cout << "substring \"" << g << "\" found at index "  << pos - s.cbegin   << endl;  }  }  Here, we twice use iterators provided by cbegin  , cend  , and begin   to pass them to the transform   algorithm, which transforms all elements of an input range to a destination range by using a transformation passed as fourth argument  see Section 6.8.1, page 225, and Section 11.6.3, page 563, for details .  The transformation is speciﬁed as a lambda  see Section 6.9, page 229 , which converts the elements of the string  the characters  to lower- or uppercase. Note that tolower   and toupper   are old C functions that use the global locale. If you have a different locale or more than one locale   13.2 Description of the String Classes  687  in your program, you should use the new form of tolower   and toupper  . See Section 16.4.4, page 895, for details.  Finally, we use the search algorithm to search for a substring with our own search criterion. This  criterion is a lambda that compares the characters in a case-insensitive way.  Alternatively, we could use the regex library:    search case-insensitive for Germany std::regex pat "Germany",  regex_constants::icase ;  smatch m; if  regex_search  s,m,pat   {     expression to search for    search case-insensitive     search regex pattern in s  cout << "substring \"Germany\" found at index "  << m.position   << endl;  }  See Section 14.6, page 732, for details.  Thus, the output of the program is as follows: original: The zip code of Braunschweig in Germany is 38100 the zip code of braunschweig in germany is 38100 lowered: uppered: THE ZIP CODE OF BRAUNSCHWEIG IN GERMANY IS 38100 substring "Germany" found at index 32  In the last output statement, you can process the difference of two string iterators to get the index of the character position:  pos - s.cbegin    You can use operator - because string iterators are random-access iterators. Similar to transferring an index into the iterator position, you can simply add the value of the index.  If you use strings in sets or maps, you might need a special sorting criterion to let the collec- tions sort the string in a case-insensitive way. See Section 7.8.6, page 351, for an example that demonstrates how to do this.  The following program demonstrates other examples of strings using iterator functions:     string stringiter2.cpp  include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {     create constant string const string hello "Hello, how are you?" ;     initialize string s with all characters of string hello string s hello.cbegin  ,hello.cend   ;   688  Chapter 13: Strings     ranged-based for loop that iterates through all the characters for  char c : s  {  cout << c;  } cout << endl;     reverse the order of all characters inside the string reverse  s.begin  , s.end   ; cout << "reverse:  " << s << endl;     sort all characters inside the string sort  s.begin  , s.end   ; cout << "ordered:  " << s << endl;     remove adjacent duplicates    - unique   reorders and returns new end    - erase   shrinks accordingly s.erase  unique s.begin  , s.end   ,  s.end   ;  cout << "no duplicates: " << s << endl;  }  The program has the following output:  Hello, how are you? reverse: ordered: no duplicates:  ?uoy era woh ,olleH ,?Haeehlloooruwy  ,?Haehloruwy  The following example uses back inserters to read the standard input into a string:     string string3.cpp  include   include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {  string input;   13.2 Description of the String Classes  689     don’t skip leading whitespaces cin.unsetf  ios::skipws ;     read all characters while compressing whitespaces const locale& loc cin.getloc   ; unique_copy istream_iterator  cin ,     locale  istream_iterator   , back_inserter input , [=]  char c1, char c2  {     beginning of source    end of source    destination    criterion for adj. duplicates  return isspace c1,loc  && isspace c2,loc ;  } ;     process input    - here: write it to the standard output cout << input;  }  By using the unique_copy   algorithm  see Section 11.7.2, page 580 , all characters are read from the input stream cin and inserted into the string input.  The passed lambda operation checks whether two characters are whitespaces. This criterion is taken by unique_copy   to detect adjacent “duplicates,” where the second element can be removed. Thus, while reading the input, the algorithm compresses multiple whitespaces  see Section 16.4.4, page 895, for a discussion of isspace   .  The criterion itself takes the current local into account. To do this, loc is initialized by the locale  of cin and passed by value to the lambda  see Section 15.8, page 790, for details of getloc   .  You can ﬁnd a similar example in the reference section about unique_copy   in Section 11.7.2,  page 582.  page 23 .  13.2.15 Internationalization  As mentioned in Section 13.2.1, page 664, the template string class basic_string  is parame- trized by the character type, the traits of the character type, and the memory model. Type string is the specializations for characters of type char, whereas types wstring, u16string, and u32string are the specializations for characters of type wchar_t, char16_t, and char32_t, respectively.  Note that you can specify the character sets used for string literals since C++11  see Section 3.1.6,  To specify the details of how to deal with aspects depending on the representation of a character type, character traits are provided. An additional class is necessary because you can’t change the in- terface of built-in types, such as char and wchar_t, and the same character type may have different traits. The details about the traits classes are described in Section 16.1.4, page 853.  The following code deﬁnes a special traits class for strings so that they operate in a case-  insensitive way:   690  Chapter 13: Strings     string icstring.hpp  ifndef ICSTRING_HPP define ICSTRING_HPP  include   include   include       replace functions of the standard char_traits     so that strings behave in a case-insensitive way struct ignorecase_traits : public std::char_traits  {     return whether c1 and c2 are equal static bool eq const char& c1, const char& c2  {  return std::toupper c1 ==std::toupper c2 ;  }    return whether c1 is less than c2 static bool lt const char& c1, const char& c2  {  return std::toupper c1 <std::toupper c2 ;  }    compare up to n characters of s1 and s2 static int compare const char* s1, const char* s2,  std::size_t n  {  for  std::size_t i=0; i<n; ++i  {  if  !eq s1[i],s2[i]   {  return lt s1[i],s2[i] ?-1:1;  }  } return 0;  }    search c in s static const char* find const char* s, std::size_t n,  for  std::size_t i=0; i<n; ++i  {  const char& c  {  if  eq s[i],c   {  return & s[i] ;  }  } return 0;  }  };     deﬁne a special type for such strings typedef std::basic_string  icstring;   13.2 Description of the String Classes  691     deﬁne an output operator    because the traits type is different from that for std::ostream inline std::ostream& operator <<  std::ostream& strm, const icstring& s  {     simply convert the icstring into a normal string return strm << std::string s.data  ,s.length   ;  }  endif     ICSTRING_HPP  The deﬁnition of the output operator is necessary because the standard deﬁnes I O operators only for streams that use the same character and traits type. But here the traits type differs, so we have to deﬁne our own output operator. For input operators, the same problem occurs.  The following program demonstrates how to use these special kinds of strings:     string icstring1.cpp  include "icstring.hpp"  int main   {  using std::cout; using std::endl;  icstring s1 "hallo" ; icstring s2 "otto" ; icstring s3 "hALLo" ;  cout << std::boolalpha; cout << s1 << " == " << s2 << " : " <<  s1==s2  << endl; cout << s1 << " == " << s3 << " : " <<  s1==s3  << endl;  icstring::size_type idx = s1.find "All" ; if  idx != icstring::npos  {  cout << "index of \"All\" in \"" << s1 << "\": "  << idx << endl;  cout << "\"All\" not found in \"" << s1 << endl;  } else {  }  }   692  Chapter 13: Strings  The program has the following output:  hallo == otto : false hallo == hALLo : true index of "All" in "hallo": 1  See Chapter 16 for more details about internationalization.  13.2.16 Performance  As usual, the standard does not specify how the string class is to be implemented but instead speciﬁes only the interface. There may be important differences in speed and memory usage, depending on the concept and priorities of the implementation.  Note that since C++11, reference counted implementations are not permitted any longer. The reason is that an implementation that lets strings share internal buffers doesn’t work in multithreaded contexts.  13.2.17 Strings and Vectors  Strings and vectors behave similarly. This is no surprise because both are containers that are typically implemented as dynamic arrays. Thus, you could consider a string as a special kind of a vector that has characters as elements. In fact, you can use a string as an STL container  see Section 13.2.14, page 684 . However, considering a string as a special kind of vector is dangerous because there are many fundamental differences between the two. Chief among these are their two primary goals: 1. The primary goal of vectors is to handle and to manipulate the elements of the container, not the container as a whole. Thus, vector implementations are optimized to operate on elements inside the container.  2. The primary goal of strings is to handle and to manipulate the container  the string  as a whole.  Thus, strings are optimized to reduce the costs of assigning and passing the whole container.  These different goals typically result in completely different implementations. For example, strings are often implemented by using reference counting; vectors never are. Nevertheless, you can also use vectors as ordinary C-strings. See Section 7.3.3, page 278, for details.   13.3 String Class in Detail  693  13.3 String Class in Detail  In this section, string stands for the corresponding string class: string, wstring, u16string, u32string, or any other specialization of class basic_string . Type char stands for the corre- sponding character type, which is char for string, wchar_t for wstring, char16_t for u16string, or char32_t for u32string. Other types and values in italic type have deﬁnitions that depend on individual deﬁnitions of the character type or traits class. The details about traits classes are provided in Section 16.1.4, page 853.  13.3.1 Type Deﬁnitions and Static Values  string::traits_type   The type of the character traits.   The second template parameter of class basic_string.   For type string, it is equivalent to char_traits . string::value_type   The type of the characters.   It is equivalent to traits_type::char_type.   For type string, it is equivalent to char. string::size_type   The unsigned integral type for size values and indices.

It is equivalent to allocator_type::pointer.   For type string, it is equivalent to char*. string::const_pointer   The type of constant character pointers.   It is equivalent to allocator_type::const_pointer.   For type string, it is equivalent to const char*. string::iterator   The type of iterators.   The exact type is implementation deﬁned.   For type string, it is typically char*. string::const_iterator   The type of constant iterators.   The exact type is implementation deﬁned.   For type string, it is typically const char*. string::reverse_iterator   The type of reverse iterators.   It is equivalent to reverse_iterator . string::const_reverse_iterator   The type of constant reverse iterators.   It is equivalent to reverse_iterator . static const size_type string::npos   A special value that indicates either “not found” or “all remaining characters.”   It is an unsigned integral value that is initialized by -1.   Be careful when you use npos. See Section 13.2.12, page 680, for details.  13.3.2 Create, Copy, and Destroy Operations  string::string      The default constructor.   Creates an empty string.  string::string  const string& str    The copy constructor.   Creates a new string as a copy of str.   13.3 String Class in Detail  695  string::string  string&& str    The move constructor.

Available since C++11.  string::string  const string& str, size_type str_idx  string::string  const string& str, size_type str_idx, size_type str_num    Create a new string that is initialized by at most the ﬁrst str_num characters of str, starting with   If str_num is missing, all characters from str_idx to the end of str are used.   Throws out_of_range if str_idx > str.size  .  index str_idx.  string::string  const char* cstr    Creates a string that is initialized by the C-string cstr.   The string is initialized by all characters of cstr up to but not including ’\0’.   Note that passing a null pointer  nullptr or NULL  results in undeﬁned behavior.   Throws length_error if the resulting size exceeds the maximum number of characters.  string::string  const char* chars, size_type chars_len    Creates a string that is initialized by chars_len characters of the character array chars.   Note that chars must have at least chars_len characters. The characters may have arbitrary   Throws length_error if chars_len is equal to string::npos.

Thus, ’\0’ has no special meaning.  string::string  size_type num, char c    Creates a string that is initialized by num occurrences of character c.

Throws length_error if the resulting size exceeds the maximum number of characters.  string::string  InputIterator beg, InputIterator end    Creates a string that is initialized by all characters of the range [beg,end .   Throws length_error if the resulting size exceeds the maximum number of characters.  string::string  InputIterator beg, InputIterator end    Creates a string that is initialized by all characters of the range [beg,end .   Throws length_error if the resulting size exceeds the maximum number of characters.   696  Chapter 13: Strings  string::string  initializer-list    Creates a new string that is initialized by the characters of initializer-list.   Available since C++11.   Throws length_error if the resulting size exceeds the maximum number of characters.  string::˜string      The destructor.   Destroys all characters and frees the memory. Most constructors allow you to pass an allocator as an additional argument  see Section 13.3.13, page 715 .  13.3.3 Operations for Size and Capacity  Size Operations  bool string::empty    const   Returns whether the string is empty  contains no characters .   It is equivalent to string::size  ==0, but it might be faster.  size_type string::size    const size_type string::length    const   Both functions return the current number of characters.   They are equivalent.   To check whether the string is empty, you should use empty   because it might be faster.  size_type string::max_size    const   Returns the maximum number of characters a string could contain.   Whenever an operation results in a string that has a length greater than max_size  , the class  throws length_error.  Capacity Operations  size_type string::capacity    const   Returns the number of characters the string could contain without reallocation.   13.3 String Class in Detail  697  capacity.  void string::reserve    void string::reserve  size_type num    The ﬁrst form is a nonbinding shrink-to-ﬁt request.

This operation might invalidate references, pointers, and iterators to characters. However, it is guaranteed that no reallocation takes place during insertions that happen after a call to reserve   until the time when an insertion would make the size greater than num. Thus, reserve   can increase speed and help to keep references, pointers, and iterators valid  see Section 13.2.5, page 670, for details .  shrink the capacity to ﬁt the current number of characters  equivalent to the ﬁrst form .  void string::shrink_to_ﬁt      Reduces the internal memory to ﬁt the current numbers of characters.

The second and third forms return the result of the comparison of a string with a C-string.   comparison might be any of the following:  operator == operator != operator < operator > operator <= operator >=    The values are compared lexicographically  see Section 13.2.7, page 673 .   698  Chapter 13: Strings  int string::compare  const string& str  const   Compares the string *this with the string str.   Returns  – 0 if both strings are equal – A value < 0 if *this is lexicographically less than str – A value > 0 if *this is lexicographically greater than str    For the comparison, traits::compare   is used  see Section 16.1.4, page 854 .

Thus, ’\0’ has no special meaning.  string& string::insert  size_type idx, size_type num, char c  iterator string::insert  const_iterator pos, size_type num, char c    Insert num occurrences of character c at the position speciﬁed by idx or pos, respectively.   The ﬁrst form inserts the new characters so that they start with index idx.   The second form inserts the new characters before the character to which iterator pos refers.   The ﬁrst form returns *this.   The second form returns the position of the ﬁrst character inserted or pos if none was inserted.   Note that the overloading of these two functions results in a possible ambiguity. If you pass 0 as the ﬁrst argument, it can be interpreted as an index, which is typically a conversion to unsigned, or as an iterator, which is often a conversion to char*. In this case, you should pass an index with its the exact type. For example:  std::string s; ... s.insert 0,1,’ ’ ; s.insert  std::string::size_type 0,1,’ ’ ;     ERROR: ambiguous    OK    Both forms throw out_of_range if idx > size  .

Erasing Characters  void string::clear    string& string::erase      Both functions delete all characters of the string. Thus, the string is empty after the call.   erase   returns *this.  string& string::erase  size_type idx  string& string::erase  size_type idx, size_type len    Both forms erase at most len characters of *this, starting at index idx.   They return *this.   If len is missing, all remaining characters are removed.   Both forms throw out_of_range if idx > size  .  iterator string::erase  const_iterator pos  iterator string::erase  const_iterator beg, const_iterator end    Both forms erase the single character at iterator position pos or all characters of the range   They return the position of the ﬁrst character after the last removed character  thus, the second   Before C++11, pos, beg, and end had type iterator.

Third template parameter of class basic_string .   For type string, it is equivalent to allocator .  allocator_type string::get_allocator    const   Returns the memory model of the string.  Strings also provide all constructors with optional allocator arguments. The following are all the string constructors, including their optional allocator arguments, according to the standard:11  namespace std {  template <typename charT,  typename traits = char_traits , typename Allocator = allocator  >  class basic_string {  public:     default constructor explicit basic_string const Allocator& a = Allocator   ;     copy and move constructor  with allocator  basic_string const basic_string& str ; basic_string basic_string&& str ; basic_string const basic_string& str, const Allocator& ; basic_string basic_string&& str, const Allocator& ;     constructor for substrings basic_string const basic_string& str,  size_type str_idx = 0, size_type str_num = npos, const Allocator& a = Allocator   ;     constructor for C-strings basic_string const charT* cstr,  const Allocator& a = Allocator   ;  11 The copy constructor with allocator, the move constructors, and the constructor for initializer list are available since C++11.   716  Chapter 13: Strings     constructor for character arrays basic_string const charT* chars, size_type chars_len,  const Allocator& a = Allocator   ;     constructor for num occurrences of a character basic_string size_type num, charT c,  const Allocator& a = Allocator   ;     constructor for a range of characters template   basic_string InputIterator beg, InputIterator end,  const Allocator& a = Allocator   ;     constructor for an initializer list basic_string initializer_list ,  const Allocator& a = Allocator   ;  ...  };  }  These constructors behave as described in Section 13.3.2, page 694, with the additional ability that you can pass your own memory model object. If the string is initialized by another string, the allocator also gets copied.12 See Chapter 19 for more details about allocators.  12 The original standard states that the default allocator is used when a string gets copied. However, this does not make much sense, so this is the proposed resolution to ﬁx this behavior.   Chapter 14 Regular Expressions  In principle, you can do the following with regular expressions:  This chapter introduces the library for regular expressions. That library allows you to use wildcards and patterns to search and replace characters in strings.   Match the whole input against a regular expression   Search for patterns that match a regular expression   Tokenize a character according to a token separator speciﬁed as a regular expression   Replace in the ﬁrst or all subsequences that match a regular expression For all these operations, you can use different grammars, which are used to deﬁne a regular expres- sion.  I begin this chapter by introducing the various operations, then discussing different grammars,  and ﬁnally listing the regex operations in detail.  14.1 The Regex Match and Search Interface  First, let’s look at how we can check whether a sequence of characters matches or partially matches a speciﬁc regular expression:     regex regex1.cpp  include   include   using namespace std;  void out  bool b  {  }  cout <<   b ? "found" : "not found"  << endl;   718  int main   {  Chapter 14: Regular Expressions     ﬁnd XML HTML-tagged value  using default syntax : regex reg1 " .* " ; bool found = regex_match  " value ",  reg1 ;     data    regular expression  out found ;     ﬁnd XML HTML-tagged value  tags before and after the value must match : regex reg2 " .* " ; found = regex_match  " value ",     data    regular expression  out found ;     ﬁnd XML HTML-tagged value  using grep syntax : regex reg3 " .* ",regex_constants::grep ; found = regex_match  " value ",     data    regular expression  reg2 ;  reg3 ;     use C-string as regular expression  needs explicit cast to regex : found = regex_match  " value ",  regex " .* "  ;     data    regular expression  out found ;  out found ; cout << endl;     regex_match   versus regex_search  : found = regex_match  "XML tag:  value ",  regex " .* "  ;     fails to match  out found ; found = regex_match  "XML tag:  value ", regex ".* .* .*"  ;  out found ; found = regex_search  "XML tag:  value ",     matches  regex " .* "  ;     matches  out found ; found = regex_search  "XML tag:  value ",  regex ".* .* .*"  ;     matches  out found ;  }  include   using namespace std;  First, we include the necessary header ﬁle and global identiﬁers in namespace std:   14.1 The Regex Match and Search Interface  719  Next, a ﬁrst example demonstrates how a regular expression can be deﬁned and used to check whether a character sequence matches a speciﬁc pattern. We declare and initialize reg1 as a regular expression:  regex reg1 " .* " ;  The type of the object representing the regular expression is std::regex. As with strings, this is a specialization of class std::basic_regex  for the character type char. For the character type wchar_t, class std::wregex is provided.  reg1 is initialized by the following regular expression:  .*   This regular expressions checks for “ someChars ” by using the syn- tax .*, where “.” stands for “any character except newline” and “*” stands for “zero or more times.” Thus, we try to match the format of a tagged XML or HTML value. The character sequence  value  matches this pattern, so regex_match  " value ",     data    regular expression  reg1 ;  yields true.  We can even specify that the leading and the trailing tags have to be the same character sequence,  which is what the next statements demonstrate:  regex reg2 " .* " ; found = regex_match  " value ",  Again, regex_match   yields true.  reg2 ;     data    regular expression  Here, we use the concept of “grouping.” We use “ ... ” to deﬁne a so-called capture group, to which we refer later on with the regular expression “\1”. Note, however, that we specify the regular expression as an ordinary character sequence, so we have to specify the “character \ followed by the character 1” as “\\1”. Alternatively, we could use a raw string, which was introduced with C++11  see Section 3.1.6, page 23 : R"  .*  "     equivalent to: " .* "  Such a raw string allows you to deﬁne a character sequence by writing exactly its contents as a raw character sequence. It starts with “R" ” and ends with “ "”. To be able to have “ "” inside the raw string, you can use a delimiter. Thus, the complete syntax of raw strings is R"delim ... delim", where delim is a character sequence of at most 16 basic characters except the backslash, whitespaces, and parentheses.  What we introduce here as special characters for regular expressions is part of the grammar they have. Note that the C++ standard library supports various grammars. The default grammar is a “modiﬁed ECMAScript grammar,” which is introduced in detail in Section 14.8, page 738. But the next statements show how a different grammar can be used:  regex reg3 " .* ",regex_constants::grep ; found = regex_match  " value ",     data    regular expression  reg3 ;   720  Chapter 14: Regular Expressions  Here, the optional second argument to the regex constructor regex_constants::grep speciﬁes a grammar like the UNIX grep command, where, for example, you have to mask the grouping characters by additional backslashes  which have to be masked by backslashes in ordinary string literals . Section 14.9, page 739, discusses the differences of the various grammars supported.  All the previous examples used a separate object to specify the regular expression. This is not necessary; however, note that just passing a string or string literal as a regular expression is not enough. Although an implicit type conversion is declared, the resulting statement won’t compile, because it is ambiguous. For example:  regex_match  " value ",     ERROR: ambiguous  regex_match  string " value " ,     ERROR: ambiguous  " .* "   " .* "   regex_match  " value ",     OK  regex " .* "    Finally, we come to the difference of regex_match   and regex_search:   regex_match   checks whether the whole character sequence matches a regular expression.   regex_search   checks whether the character sequence partially matches a regular expression. There is no other difference. Thus,  regex_search  data, regex pattern    is always equivalent to  regex_match  data, regex " .\n *"+pattern+" .\n *"    where “ .\n *” stands for any number of any character  “.” stands for any character except the newline character and “” stands for “or” .  Now, you might say that these statements miss important information, at least for the function regex_search  : where a regular expression matches a given character sequence. For this and many more features, we have to introduce new versions of regex_match   and regex_search  , where a new parameter returns all necessary information about a match.  14.2 Dealing with Subexpressions  Consider the following example:     regex regex2.cpp  include   include   include   include   using namespace std;   14.2 Dealing with Subexpressions  721  int main   {  string data = "XML tag:  the value ."; cout << "data:  " << data << "\n\n";  smatch m; bool found = regex_search  data,     for returned details of the match  m, regex "  .*  "  ;  " << boolalpha << m.empty   << endl; " << m.size   << endl;     print match details: cout << "m.empty  : cout << "m.size  : if  found  {  cout << "m.str  : cout << "m.length  : cout << "m.position  : cout << "m.prefix  .str  : " << m.prefix  .str   << endl; cout << "m.suffix  .str  : " << m.suffix  .str   << endl; cout << endl;  " << m.str   << endl; " << m.length   << endl; " << m.position   << endl;     iterating over all matches  using the match index : for  int i=0; i<m.size  ; ++i  {  cout << "m[" << i << "].str  : cout << "m.str " << i << " : cout << "m.position " << i << " :  " << m[i].str   << endl; " << m.str i  << endl; " << m.position i   << endl;  } cout << endl;     iterating over all matches  using iterators : cout << "matches:" << endl; for  auto pos = m.begin  ; pos != m.end  ; ++pos  {  cout << " " << *pos << " "; cout  length   << " " << endl;  }  }  }  In this example, we can demonstrate the use of match_results objects, which can be passed to regex_match   and regex_search   to get details of matches. Class std::match_results  is a template that has to get instantiated by the iterator type of the characters processed. The C++ standard library provides some predeﬁned instantiations:   722  Chapter 14: Regular Expressions    smatch: for details of matches in strings   cmatch: for details of matches in C-strings  const char*    wsmatch: for details of matches in wstrings   wcmatch: for details of matches in wide C-strings  const wchar_t*  Thus, if we call regex_match   or regex_search   for C++ strings, type smatch has to be used; for ordinary string literals, type cmatch has to be used.  What a match_results object yields is shown in detail by the example, where we search for  the regular expression    .*    in the string data, initialized by the following character sequence:  "XML tag:  the value ."  Regex:     .*     XML tag:  the value .  m[1]   m[3]   m[2]   m[0]   prefix     suffix     Figure14.1. RegexMatchInterface  After the call, the match_results object m has a state, which is visible in Figure 14.1 and provides the following interface:   In general, the match_results object contains:  – A sub_match object m[0] for all the matched characters – A prefix  , a sub_match object that represents all characters before the ﬁrst matched  character  character  – A suffix  , a sub_match object that represents all characters after the last matched   In addition, for any capture group, you have access to a corresponding sub_match object m[n]. Because the regex speciﬁed here deﬁnes three capture groups, one for the introducing tag, one for the value, and one for the ending tag, these are available in m[1], m[2], and m[3].    size   yields the number of sub_match objects  including m[0] .   All sub_match objects are derived from pair  and have the position of the ﬁrst character as member first and the position after the last character as member second. In addition, str   yields the characters as a string, length   yields the number of characters, operator << writes the characters to a stream, and an implicit type conversion to a string is deﬁned.   14.2 Dealing with Subexpressions  723    In addition, the match_results object as a whole provides:  – member function str   to yield the matched string as a whole  calling str   or str 0   or the nth matched substring  calling str n  , which is empty if no matched substring exists  thus, passing an n greater than size   is valid   – member function length   to yield the length of the matched string as a whole  calling length   or length 0   or the length of the nth matched substring  calling length n  , which is 0 if no matched substring exists  thus, passing an n greater than size   is valid   – member function position   to yield the position of the matched string as a whole  call- ing position   or position 0   or the position of the nth matched substring  calling length n    – member functions begin  , cbegin  , end  , and cend   to iterate over the sub_match  objects m[0] to m[n]  For this reason, the program has the following output:  data:  XML tag:  the value .  m.empty  : m.size  : m.str  : m.length  : m.position  : m.prefix  .str  : XML tag: m.suffix  .str  : .  false 4  the value  30 9  m[0].str  : m.str 0 : m.position 0 : m[1].str  : m.str 1 : m.position 1 : m[2].str  : m.str 2 : m.position 2 : m[3].str  : m.str 3 : m.position 3 :  matches:   the value   the value  9 tag-name tag-name 10 the value the value 19 tag-name tag-name 30   the value   length: 30  tag-name  length: 8  the value  length: 9  tag-name  length: 8    724  Chapter 14: Regular Expressions  In other words, you have four ways to yield the whole matched string in a match_result  m:  m.str   m.str 0  m[0].str   * m.begin        yields whole matches string    ditto    ditto    ditto  and three ways to yield the nth matches substring, if any:  m.str 1  m[1].str   * m.begin  +1      yields ﬁrst matched substring, if any, or "" otherwise    ditto    yields ﬁrst matched substring, if any, invalid otherwise  If you call regex_match   instead of regex_search  , the match_results interface is the same. However, because regex_match   always matches the whole character sequence, preﬁx and sufﬁx will always be empty.  Now we have all the information we need to ﬁnd all matches of a regular expression, as the  following program demonstrates:     regex regex3.cpp  include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {  string data = " \n"  "  Nico \n" "  Josuttis \n" " \n";  regex reg "  .*  " ;     iterate over all matches auto pos=data.cbegin  ; auto end=data.cend  ; smatch m; for   ; regex_search pos,end,m,reg ; pos=m.suffix  .first  {  " << m.str   << endl; cout << "match: cout << " tag: " << m.str 1  << endl; cout << " value: " << m.str 2  << endl;  }  }   14.2 Dealing with Subexpressions  725  Here, we use the regular expression  the backslash has to get escaped in the C++ string literal     .*    to search for:   anyNumberOfAnyChars2   Thus, we search for XML tags  \1 means: the same as the ﬁrst matched substring .  In this example, we use this regular expression by a different interface that iterates over matched character sequences. For this reason, instead of passing the character sequence as a whole, we pass a range of the corresponding elements. We start with the range of all characters, using cbegin   and cend   of the string we search in:  auto pos=data.cbegin  ; auto end=data.cend  ;  Then, after each match, we continue the search with the beginning of the remaining characters:  smatch m; for   ; regex_search pos,end,m,reg ; pos=m.suffix  .first  {  ...  }  So, because the string data we parse has the following value:      Nico   Josuttis      the program has the following output:  Nico  first  match:  tag: value: Nico  match:   Josuttis  last  tag: value: Josuttis  To reinitialize pos, we could also pass m[0].second    the end of the matched characters  instead of the expression m.suffix  .first. Note that in both cases we have to use const_iterators. Thus, using begin   and end   to initialize pos and end would not compile here.  Note also that the output will be different if the tags in data were not separated by a newline  character:  Then, the output would be:    Nico  Josuttis    match:    Nico  Josuttis   person  tag: value:  Nico  Josuttis    726  Chapter 14: Regular Expressions  The reason is that regex functions try to operate in a greedy manner. That is, the longest match possible is returned. With newline characters, the tag opened with   could not match, because we were looking for “.*” as value, which means “any character except newline any times.” Without newline characters, the whole tag opened with   now fulﬁlls this pattern. To ensure that we still ﬁnd the inner tags, we’d have to change the regular expression, for example, as follows:  "  [^>]*  "  For the value, we now look for “[^>]*”, which means “all but character < any times.” Therefore, subtags do not ﬁt any longer as part of a value.  14.3 Regex Iterators  To iterate over all matches of a regular search, we can also use regex iterators. These iterators are of type regex_iterator  and have the usual instantiations for strings and character sequences with preﬁxes s, c, ws, or wc. Consider the following example:     regex regexiter1.cpp  include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {  string data = " \n"  "  Nico \n" "  Josuttis \n" " \n";  regex reg "  .*  " ;     iterate over all matches  using a regex_iterator : sregex_iterator pos data.cbegin  ,data.cend  ,reg ; sregex_iterator end; for   ; pos!=end ; ++pos   {  "  str   << endl; cout << "match: cout << " tag: "  str 1  << endl; cout  str 2  << endl;  }     use a regex_iterator to process each matched substring as element in an algorithm: sregex_iterator beg data.cbegin  ,data.cend  ,reg ;   14.4 Regex Token Iterators  727  for_each  beg,end,[] const smatch& m  {  " << m.str   << endl; cout << "match: cout << " tag: " << m.str 1  << endl; cout << " value: " << m.str 2  << endl;  } ;  }  }  Here, with  sregex_iterator pos data.cbegin  ,data.cend  ,reg ;  we initialize a regex iterator, iterating over data to search for matches of reg. The default constructor of this type deﬁnes a past-the-end iterator:  sregex_iterator end;  We can now use this iterator as any other bidirectional iterator  see Section 9.2.4, page 437 : Opera- tor * yields the current match, while operators ++ and -- move to the next or previous match. Thus, the following prints all the matches, their tags, and their values  as in the previous example :  for   ; pos!=end ; ++pos   {  "  str   << endl; cout << "match: cout << " tag: "  str 1  << endl; cout  str 2  << endl;  And, of course, you can use such an iterator in an algorithm. Thus, the following calls the lambda passed as third argument for each match  see Section 6.9, page 229, for details about lambdas and algorithms :     use a regex_iterator to process each matched substring as element in an algorithm: sregex_iterator beg data.cbegin  ,data.cend  ,reg ; sregex_iterator end; for_each  beg,end,[] const smatch& m  {  " << m.str   << endl; cout << "match: cout << " tag: " << m.str 1  << endl; cout << " value: " << m.str 2  << endl;  } ;  14.4 Regex Token Iterators  A regex iterator helps to iterate over matched subsequences. However, sometimes you also want to process all the contents between matched expressions. That is especially the case if you want to split a string into separate tokens, separated by something, which might even be speciﬁed as a regular expression. Class regex_token_iterator  having the usual instantiations for strings and character sequences with preﬁxes s, c, ws, or wc provides this functionality.   728  Chapter 14: Regular Expressions  Again, to initialize it, you can pass the beginning and end of a character sequence and a regular expression. In addition, you can specify a list of integral values, which represent elements of a “tokenization”:   -1 means that you are interested in all the subsequences between matched regular expressions   0 means that you are interested in all the matched regular expressions  token separators .   Any other value n means that you are interested in the matched nth subexpression inside the   token separators .  regular expressions.  Now consider the following example:     regex regextokeniter1.cpp  include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {  string data = " \n"  "  Nico \n" "  Josuttis \n" " \n";  regex reg "  .*  " ;     iterate over all matches  using a regex_token_iterator : sregex_token_iterator pos data.cbegin  ,data.cend  ,    sequence  reg, {0,2} ;     token separator    0: full match, 2: second substring  sregex_token_iterator end; for   ; pos!=end ; ++pos   {  cout << "match:  "  str   << endl;  } cout << endl;  string names = "nico, jim, helmut, paul, tim, john paul, rita";    separated by , ; or . and spaces regex sep "[ \t\n]*[,;.][ \t\n]*" ; sregex_token_iterator p names.cbegin  ,names.cend  ,  sep, -1 ;     -1: values between separators     sequence    separator  sregex_token_iterator e; for   ; p!=e ; ++p   {   14.4 Regex Token Iterators  729  cout << "name:  " << *p << endl;  }  }  The program has the following output:  Nico  Nico  Josuttis  Josuttis  match: match: match: match:  name: name: name: name: name: name: name:  nico jim helmut paul tim john paul rita  Here, a regex token iterator for strings  preﬁx s  is initialized by the character sequence data, the regular expression reg, and a list of two indexes  0 and 2 :  sregex_token_iterator pos data.cbegin  ,data.cend  ,    sequence  reg, {0,2} ;     token separator    0: full match, 2: second substring  The list of indexes we are interested in deﬁnes that we are interested in all matches and the second substring of each match.  The usual application of such a regex token iterator demonstrates the next iteration. Here, we  have a list of names:  string names = "nico, jim, helmut, paul, tim, john paul, rita";  Now a regular expression deﬁnes what separates these names. Here, it is a comma or a semicolon or a period with optional whitespaces  spaces, tabs, and newlines  around:  regex sep "[ \t\n]*[,;.][ \t\n]*" ;     separated by , ; or . and spaces  Alternatively, we could use the following regular expression  see Section 14.8, page 738 :  regex sep "[[:space:]]*[,;.][[:space:]]*" ;     separated by , ; or . and spaces  Because we are interested only in the values between these token separators, the program processes each name in this list  with spaces removed .  Note that the interface of regex_token_iterator allows you to specify the tokens of interest  in various ways:   You can pass a single integral value.   You can pass an initializer list of integral values  see Section 3.1.3, page 15 .   You can pass a vector of integral values.   You can pass an array of integral values.   730  Chapter 14: Regular Expressions  14.5 Replacing Regular Expressions  Finally, let’s look at the interface that allows you to replace character sequences that match a regular expression. Consider the following example:     regex regexreplace1.cpp  include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {  string data = " \n"  "  Nico \n" "  Josuttis \n" " \n";  regex reg "  .*  " ;     print data with replacement for matched patterns cout << regex_replace  data,  << endl;     same using sed syntax cout << regex_replace  data,  reg, " "      data    regular expression    replacement  reg, " ", regex_constants::format_sed      data    regular expression    replacement    format ﬂag  << endl;     use iterator interface, and    - format_no_copy:    - format_first_only: replace only the ﬁrst match found string res2; regex_replace  back_inserter res2 ,  don’t copy characters that don’t match  data.begin  , data.end  , reg, " ", regex_constants::format_no_copy   regex_constants::format_first_only ;     destination    source range    regular expression    replacement    format ﬂags   14.5 Replacing Regular Expressions  731  Here again, we use a regular expression to match XML HTML-tagged values. But this time, we transform the input into the following output:  cout << res2 << endl;  }                           To do this, we specify a replacement where we can use matched subexpressions with the character $  see Table 14.1 . Here, we use $1 and $2 to use the tag and the value found in the replacement:  " "     replacement using default syntax Again, we can avoid having to escape the quotes by using a raw string:    replacement using default syntax  R"   "  By passing a regex constant regex_constants::format_sed, you can instead use the replacement syntax of the UNIX command sed  see the second column in Table 14.1 :  " "     replacement using sed syntax  Again, by using a raw string, we can avoid escaping backslashes:  R"   "     replacement using sed syntax speciﬁed as raw string  sed Pattern Meaning & \n  Default Pattern $& $n $‘ $’ $$  The matched pattern The nth matched capture group The preﬁx of the matched pattern The sufﬁx of the matched pattern The character $  Table14.1. RegexReplacementSymbols   732  Chapter 14: Regular Expressions  14.6 Regex Flags  We already introduced some regex constants you can use to inﬂuence the behavior of the regex interfaces:  regex reg3 " .* ",regex_constants::grep ;     use grep grammar  regex_replace  data, reg,  string " " , regex_constants::format_sed      use sed replacement syntax  But there is more. Table 14.2 lists all regex constants provided by the regex library and where they can be used. In principle, they can always be passed as the optional last argument to the regex constructor or to the regex functions.  Here is a small program that demonstrates the usage of some ﬂags:     regex regex4.cpp  include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {     case-insensitive ﬁnd LaTeX index entries string pat1 = R" \\.*index\{ [^}]* \} "; string pat2 = R" \\.*index\{ .* \}\{ .* \} "; regex pat  pat1+"\n"+pat2,     ﬁrst capture group    2nd and 3rd capture group  regex_constants::egrepregex_constants::icase ;     initialize string with characters from standard input: string data  istreambuf_iterator  cin  ,  istreambuf_iterator    ;     search and print matching index entries: smatch m; auto pos = data.cbegin  ; auto end = data.cend  ; for   ; regex_search  pos,end,m,pat ; pos=m.suffix  .first  {  cout << "match: " << m.str   << endl; cout << " cout << "  val: " << m.str 1 +m.str 2  << endl; see: " << m.str 3  << endl;  }  }   14.6 Regex Flags  733  regex_constants Meaning  Regex Grammar:  ECMAScript basic extended awk grep egrep  icase nosubs optimize collate  Other Creation Flags:  Algorithm Flags:  match_not_null match_not_bol match_not_eol match_not_bow match_not_eow match_continuous  match_any match_prev_avail  Replacement Flags: format_default format_sed format_first_only format_no_copy  Use ECMAScript grammar  default .

Replace the ﬁrst match only. Don’t copy characters that don’t match.  Table14.2. RegexConstantsofNamespace std::regex_constants  The goal is to ﬁnd LATEX index entries that might have one or two arguments. In addition, the entries might use lowercase or uppercase mode. So, we have to search for either of the following:   A backlash followed by some characters and index  lower- or uppercase  and then the index  entry surrounded by braces for something like the following:  \index{STL}% \MAININDEX{standard template library}%    A backlash followed by some characters and index  lower- or uppercase , and then the index  entry and a “see also” entry surrounded by braces for something like the following:  \SEEINDEX{standard template library}{STL}%   734  Chapter 14: Regular Expressions  Using the egrep grammar, we can put a newline character between these two regular expressions.  In fact, grep and egrep can search for multiple regular expressions at the same time, speciﬁed in separate lines.  However, we have to take greediness into account, which means that we have to ensure that the ﬁrst regular expression does not also match the sequences that should match the second regular expression. So, instead of allowing any character inside the index entry, we have to ensure that no braces occur. As a result, we have the following regular expressions:  \\.*index\{ [^}]* \} \\.*index\{ .* \}\{ .* \}  which can be speciﬁed as raw strings:  R" \\.*index\{ [^}]* \} " R" \\.*index\{ .* \}\{ .* \} "  or as regular string literals:  "\\\\.*index\\{ [^}]* \\}" "\\\\.*index\\{ .* \\}\\{ .* \\}"  We create the ﬁnal regular expression by concatenating both expressions and passing the ﬂags to use a grammar in which \n separates alternative patterns  see Section 14.9, page 739  and to ignore case sensitivity:  regex pat  pat1+"\n"+pat2,  regex_constants::egrepregex_constants::icase ;  As input, we use all characters read from standard input. Here, we use a string data, which is initialized by begin and end of all characters read  see Section 7.1.2, page 256, and Section 15.13.2, page 830, for details :  string data  istreambuf_iterator  cin  ,  istreambuf_iterator    ;  Now note that the ﬁrst regular expression has one capture group, whereas the second regular expres- sion has two capture groups. Thus, if the ﬁrst regex matches, we have the index value in the ﬁrst subgroup. If the second regex matches, we have the index value in the second submatch and the “see also” value in the third submatch. For this reason, we output the contents of the ﬁrst plus the contents of the second submatch  one has a value and the other is empty  as value found:  smatch m; auto pos = data.begin  ; auto end = data.end  ; for   ; regex_search  pos,end,m,pat ; pos=m.suffix  .first  {  cout << "match: " << m.str   << endl; cout << " cout << "  val: " << m.str 1 +m.str 2  << endl; see: " << m.str 3  << endl;  }  Note that calling str 2  and str 3  is valid even if no match exists. str   is guaranteed to yield an empty string in this case.   735  14.7 Regex Exceptions  With the following input:  \chapter{The Standard Template Library} \index{STL}% \MAININDEX{standard template library}% \SEEINDEX{standard template library}{STL}% This is the basic chapter about the STL. \section{STL Components} \hauptindex{STL, introduction}% The \stl{} is based on the cooperation of ...  the program has the following output:  match: \index{STL}  val: STL see:  match: \MAININDEX{standard template library}  val: standard template library see:  match: \SEEINDEX{standard template library}{STL}  val: standard template library see: STL  match: \hauptindex{STL, introduction}  val: STL, introduction see:  14.7 Regex Exceptions  When regular expressions are parsed, things can become very complicated. The C++ standard li- brary provides a special exception class to deal with regular-expression exceptions. This class is derived from std::runtime_error  see Section 4.3.1, page 41  and provides an additional mem- ber code   to yield an error code. This might help to ﬁnd out what’s wrong if an exception is thrown when processing regular expressions.  Unfortunately, the error codes returned by code   are implementation speciﬁc, so it doesn’t help to print them directly. Instead, you have to use something like the following header ﬁle to deal with regex exceptions in a reasonable way:     regex regexexception.hpp  include   include    template   std::string regexCode  T code  {   736  Chapter 14: Regular Expressions  switch  code  {  case std::regex_constants::error_collate:  return "error_collate: "  "regex has invalid collating element name";  case std::regex_constants::error_ctype:  return "error_ctype: "  "regex has invalid character class name";  case std::regex_constants::error_escape:  return "error_escape: "  "regex has invalid escaped char. or trailing escape";  case std::regex_constants::error_backref:  return "error_backref: "  "regex has invalid back reference";  case std::regex_constants::error_brack:  return "error_brack: "  "regex has mismatched ’[’ and ’]’";  case std::regex_constants::error_paren:  return "error_paren: "  "regex has mismatched ’ ’ and ’ ’";  case std::regex_constants::error_brace:  return "error_brace: "  "regex has mismatched ’{’ and ’}’";  case std::regex_constants::error_badbrace:  return "error_badbrace: "  "regex has invalid range in {} expression";  case std::regex_constants::error_range:  return "error_range: "  "regex has invalid character range, such as ’[b-a]’";  case std::regex_constants::error_space:  return "error_space: "  "insufficient memory to convert regex into finite state";  case std::regex_constants::error_badrepeat:  return "error_badrepeat: "  "one of *?+{ not preceded by valid regex";  case std::regex_constants::error_complexity:  return "error_complexity: "  "complexity of match against regex over pre-set level";  case std::regex_constants::error_stack:  return "error_stack: "  "insufficient memory to determine regex match";  } return "unknown non-standard regex error code";  }   14.7 Regex Exceptions  737  The detailed explanation written in parentheses after the name of the error code is taken directly from the speciﬁcation of the C++ standard library. The following program demonstrates how to use it:     regex regex5.cpp  include   include   include "regexexception.hpp" using namespace std;  int main   {  try {     initialize regular expression with invalid syntax: regex pat  "\\\\.*index\\{ [^}]* \\}",  regex_constants::grepregex_constants::icase ;  ...  } catch  const regex_error& e  {  cerr << "regex_error: \n"  << " what  : " << e.what   << "\n" << " code  : " << regexCode e.code    << endl;  }  }  Because we use the grep grammar here but do escape the characters { and }, the program might have an output such as the following:  regex_error:  what  : regular expression error code  : error_badbrace: regex has invalid range in {} expression   738  Chapter 14: Regular Expressions  14.8 The Regex ECMAScript Grammar  The default grammar of the regex library is a “modiﬁed ECMAScript” grammar  see [ECMAScript] , which is a much more powerful grammar than all the other grammars available. Table 14.3 lists the most important special expressions with their meanings.  Meaning Any character except newline One of the characters ...  may contain ranges  None of the characters ...  may contain ranges  A character of the speciﬁed character class charclass  see Table 14.4  A newline, tabulator, form feed, carriage return, or vertical tab A hexadecimal or Unicode character  Expression .

CommonRegexExpressionsfortheDefault ECMAScript Grammar  Inside the bracket expressions, you can specify any combination of characters  including spe- cial characters , character ranges  for example, [0-9a-z] , and character classes  for example, [[:digit:]] . A leading ^ negates the whole expression, so the whole bracket expression means “any character except ...”. Table 14.4 lists the possible character classes of regular expressions. Note that the basic classes correspond to the convenience functions for character classiﬁcations in Sec- tion 16.4.4, page 895. However, the one-letter shortcuts are supported only by regular expressions. The character class escape sequences are supported only by the ECMAScript grammar.  Here are some examples: [_[:alpha:]][_[:alnum:]]*  .\n * [123]?[0-9]\.1?[0-9]\.20[0-9]{2}    a date in the ﬁrst century of 2000     a C++ identiﬁer    any number of any character  including newlines       German format, for example 24.12.2010    14.9 Other Grammars  739  Character Class [[:alnum:]]  Shortcut Esc.

CharacterClassesandCorrespondingEscapeSequences ECMAScript   14.9 Other Grammars  Beside the default ECMAScript grammar, the C++ standard library provides support for ﬁve other grammars, which you can specify by using the corresponding regex constants  see Section 14.6, page 732 . So, you can choose from the following:   ECMAScript: the default ECMAScript grammar   basic: the basic regular expression  BRE  grammar of POSIX   extended: the extended regular expression  ERE  grammar of POSIX   awk: the grammar of the UNIX tool awk   grep: the grammar of the UNIX tool grep   egrep: the grammar of the UNIX tool egrep Table 14.5 lists the major differences among those grammars. As you can see, the ECMAScript grammar is by far the most powerful one. The only feature it doesn’t support is the use of newline characters to separate multiple patterns with “or,” as grep and egrep provide, and the ability of awk to specify octal escape sequences.   740  Feature  ECMA- Script  basic  \  \  \{ \}  Chapter 14: Regular Expressions  awk  grep  egrep  exten- ded     { } Yes Yes Yes - - - - - - - -  - - - - Yes - - - - - -      { } Yes Yes Yes - - - - - Yes Yes Yes  \  \  \{ \}  - - - Yes Yes - - - - - -      { } Yes Yes Yes Yes - - - - - - -  Characters for grouping Characters for repetitions ? means “zero or one” + means “at least one”  means “or” \n separates alternative patterns \n refers to group n Word boundaries  \b and \B  Hex and Unicode escape sequ.

RegexGrammarDifferences  14.10 Basic Regex Signatures in Detail  Table 14.6 lists the signatures of the basic regex operations regex_match    see Section 14.1, page 717 , regex_search    see Section 14.1, page 717 , and regex_replace    see Section 14.5, page 730 . As you can see, there are always overloads to operate on strings, which can be both objects of class basic_string  and ordinary C-strings, such as string literals, and iterators, which specify the begin and end of the character sequence to process. In addition, you can always pass format ﬂags as an optional last argument.  Both regex_match   and regex_search   return true if a match was found. They also allow you to optionally pass an argument matchRet that returns details of the  sub matches found. These arguments of type std::match_results   introduced in Section 14.2, page 721  must be instantiated for an iterator type that corresponds with the character type:   For C++ strings, it is the corresponding const iterator. For types string and wstring, the  corresponding types smatch and wsmatch are deﬁned:  typedef match_results  typedef match_results  wsmatch;  smatch;    For C-strings including string literals, it is the corresponding pointer type. For c-strings of char  and wchar_t characters, the corresponding types cmatch and wcmatch are deﬁned:  typedef match_results  typedef match_results  wcmatch;  cmatch;  For regex_replace  , you have to pass the replacement speciﬁcation repl as a string  again, it is overloaded for both objects of class basic_string  and ordinary C-strings, such as string literals . The string version returns a new string with the corresponding replacements.

Finally, note that to avoid ambiguities no implicit type conversion from strings or string literals to type regex is provided. Thus, you always explicitly have to convert any string holding a regular expression to type std::regex  or std::basic_regex  .   This page intentionally left blank    Chapter 15 Input Output Using Stream Classes  The classes for I O form an important part of the C++ standard library; a program without I O is not of much use. The I O classes from the C++ standard library are not restricted to ﬁles or to screen and keyboard but instead form an extensible framework for the formatting of arbitrary data and access to arbitrary “external representations.”  The IOStream library, as the classes for I O are called, is the only part of the C++ standard library that was widely used prior to the standardization of C++98. Early distributions of C++ systems came with a set of classes, developed at AT&T, that established a de facto standard for doing I O. Although these classes have undergone several changes to ﬁt consistently into the C++ standard library and to suit new needs, the basic principles of the IOStream library remain unchanged.  This chapter ﬁrst presents a general overview of the most important components and techniques, and then demonstrates in detail how the IOStream library can be used in practice. Its use ranges from simple formatting to the integration of new external representations, a topic that is often addressed improperly.  This chapter does not attempt to discuss all aspects of the IOStream library in detail; to do that would take an entire book by itself. For details not found here, please consult one of the books that focus on the I O stream library or the reference manual of the C++ standard library.  Many thanks to Dietmar Kuhl, an expert on I O and internationalization in the C++ standard  ¨  library, who gave valuable feedback and wrote initial parts of this chapter.  Recent Changes with C++11  C++98 speciﬁed almost all features of the IOStream library. Here is a list of the most important features added with C++11:   A few new manipulators were introduced: hexfloat and defaultfloat  see Section 15.7.6, page 788 , as well as get_time   and put_time    see Section 16.4.3, page 890  and get_money   and put_money    see Section 16.4.2, page 882 .   In order to provide more information about an exception, the class for exceptions is now derived from std::system_error rather than directly from std::exception  see Section 15.4.4, page 762 .   744  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  const char*  see Section 15.9.1, page 794 .    String stream and ﬁle stream classes now support rvalue and move semantics, so you can move construct, move assign, and swap a string stream or a ﬁle stream. This also provides the ability to use temporary string or ﬁle streams for I O. See Section 15.9.2, page 795, and Section 15.10.2, page 806,   File streams now also allow you to pass a std::string for the ﬁlename rather than only a   The output and input operators  > are now also overloaded for long long and unsigned   I O streams now partially support concurrency  see Section 15.2.2, page 752 .

This section could be skipped by readers familiar with iostream basics.  15.1.1 Stream Objects  In C++, I O is performed by using streams. A stream is a “stream of data” in which character sequences “ﬂow.” Following the principles of object orientation, a stream is an object with properties that are deﬁned by a class. Output is interpreted as data ﬂowing into a stream; input is interpreted as data ﬂowing out of a stream. Global objects are predeﬁned for the standard I O channels.  15.1.2 Stream Classes  Just as there are different kinds of I O — for example, input, output, and ﬁle access — there are different classes depending on the type of I O. The following are the most important stream classes:   Class istream deﬁnes input streams that can be used to read data.   Class ostream deﬁnes output streams that can be used to write data. Both classes are instantiations of the class templates basic_istream  or basic_ostream , respectively, using char as the character type. In fact, the whole IOStream library does not depend on a speciﬁc character type. Instead, the character type used is a template argument for most of the classes in the IOStream library. This parametrization corresponds to the string classes and is used for internationalization  see also Chapter 16 .   15.1 Common Background of I O Streams  745  This section concentrates on output to and input from “narrow streams”: streams dealing with char as the character type. Later in this chapter, the discussion is extended to streams that have other character types.  15.1.3 Global Stream Objects  The IOStream library deﬁnes several global objects of type istream and ostream. These objects correspond to the standard I O channels:   cin, of class istream, is the standard input channel used for user input. This stream cor- responds to C’s stdin. Normally, this stream is connected to the keyboard by the operating system.   cout, of class ostream, is the standard output channel used for program output. This stream corresponds to C’s stdout. Normally, this stream is connected to the monitor by the operating system.   cerr, of class ostream, is the standard error channel used for all kinds of error messages. This stream corresponds to C’s stderr. Normally, this stream is also connected to the monitor by the operating system. By default, cerr is not buffered.   clog, of class ostream, is the standard logging channel. It has no C equivalent. By default, this stream is connected to the same destination as cerr, with the difference that output to clog is buffered.  The separation of “normal” output and error messages makes it possible to treat these two kinds of output differently when executing a program. For example, the normal output of a program can be redirected into a ﬁle while the error messages are still appearing on the console. Of course, this requires that the operating system support redirection of the standard I O channels  most operat- ing systems do . This separation of standard channels originates from the UNIX concept of I O redirection.  15.1.4 Stream Operators  The shift operators >> for input and << for output are overloaded for the corresponding stream classes. For this reason, the “shift operators” in C++ became the “I O operators.”1 Using these operators, it is possible to chain multiple I O operations.  For example, for each iteration, the following loop reads two integers from the standard input as  long as only integers are entered and writes them to the standard output:  1 Because these operators insert characters into a stream or extract characters from a stream, some people also call the I O operators inserters and extractors.   746  int a, b;  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes     as long as input of a and b is successful while  std::cin >> a >> b  {     output a and b std::cout << "a: " << a << " b: " << b << std::endl;  }  15.1.5 Manipulators  At the end of most output statements, a so-called manipulator is written:  std::cout << std::endl  Manipulators are special objects that are used to, guess what, manipulate a stream. Often, manip- ulators change only the way input is interpreted or output is formatted, like the manipulators for the numeric bases dec, hex, and oct. Thus, manipulators for ostreams do not necessarily create output, and manipulators for istreams do not necessary consume input. But some manipulators do trigger some immediate action. For example, a manipulator can be used to ﬂush the output buffer or to skip whitespace in the input buffer.  The manipulator endl means “end line” and does two things:  1. Outputs a newline  that is, the character ’\n’  2. Flushes the output buffer  forces a write of all buffered data for the given stream, using the stream  method flush     The most important manipulators deﬁned by the IOStream library are provided in Table 15.1. Sec- tion 15.6, page 774, discusses manipulators in more detail, including those that are deﬁned in the IOStream library, and explains how to deﬁne your own manipulators.  Meaning  Manipulator Class endl ends flush ws  ostream Outputs ’\n’ and ﬂushes the output buffer ostream Outputs ’\0’ ostream istream Reads and discards whitespaces  Flushes the output buffer  Table15.1. TheIOStreamLibrary’sMostImportantManipulators  15.1.6 A Simple Example  The use of the stream classes is demonstrated by the following example. This program reads two ﬂoating-point values and outputs their product:   15.1 Common Background of I O Streams  747     io io1.cpp  include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {  double x, y;     operands     read ﬁrst operand cout << "first operand: if  !  cin >> x   {  ";  << endl;  return EXIT_FAILURE;     read second operand cout << "second operand: "; if  !  cin >> y   {  }  }  }     print header string cout << "Multiplication of two floating point values" << endl;     input error    => error message and exit program with error status cerr << "error while reading the first floating value"     input error    => error message and exit program with error status cerr << "error while reading the second floating value"  << endl;  return EXIT_FAILURE;     print operands and result cout << x << " times " << y << " equals " << x * y << endl;   748  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  15.2 Fundamental Stream Classes and Objects  15.2.1 Classes and Class Hierarchy  The stream classes of the IOStream library form a hierarchy, as shown in Figure 15.1. For class templates, the upper row shows the name of the class template, and the lower row presents the names of the instantiations for the character types char and wchar_t.  Figure15.1. ClassHierarchyoftheFundamentalStreamClasses  The classes in this class hierarchy play the following roles:    The base class ios_base deﬁnes the properties of all stream classes independent of the char- acter type and the corresponding character traits. Most of this class consists of components and functions for state and format ﬂags.   The class template basic_ios  is derived from ios_base and deﬁnes the common prop- erties of all stream classes that depend on the character types and the corresponding character traits. These properties include the deﬁnition of the buffer used by the stream. The buffer is an object of a class derived from the template class basic_streambuf  with the corresponding template instantiation. It performs the actual reading and or writing.   The class templates basic_istream  and basic_ostream  derive virtually from basic_ios  and deﬁne objects that can be used for reading or writing, respectively. Like basic_ios , these classes are templates that are parametrized with a character type and its traits. When internationalization does not matter, the corresponding instantiations for the char- acter type char — istream and ostream — are used.   cid:26   cid:8   cid:10   cid:16   cid:2   cid:30   cid:16   cid:3   cid:10   cid:31     cid:16   cid:17   cid:18   cid:19   cid:20   cid:19   cid:21   cid:16   cid:17   cid:18   cid:16   cid:3   cid:10   cid:30   cid:26   cid:8   cid:10   cid:20   cid:26   cid:8   cid:10   cid:16   cid:2   cid:30   cid:10   cid:6   cid:7   cid:20   cid:8   cid:12   cid:26   cid:19   cid:11   cid:31     cid:18   cid:22   cid:23   cid:13   cid:10   cid:24   cid:25   cid:12   cid:26   cid:19   cid:20   cid:19   cid:21   cid:18   cid:22   cid:23   cid:13   cid:10   cid:24   cid:25   cid:12   cid:26   cid:26   cid:8   cid:10   cid:16   cid:2   cid:30   cid:16   cid:10   cid:6   cid:7   cid:20   cid:8   cid:12   cid:31     cid:16   cid:18   cid:22   cid:23   cid:13   cid:10   cid:24   cid:19   cid:20   cid:19   cid:21   cid:16   cid:18   cid:22   cid:23   cid:13   cid:10   cid:24   cid:26   cid:8   cid:10   cid:16   cid:2   cid:30   cid:3   cid:10   cid:6   cid:7   cid:20   cid:8   cid:12   cid:31     cid:17   cid:18   cid:22   cid:23   cid:13   cid:10   cid:24   cid:19   cid:20   cid:19   cid:21   cid:17   cid:18   cid:22   cid:23   cid:13   cid:10   cid:24   cid:26   cid:8   cid:10   cid:16   cid:2   cid:30   cid:16   cid:3   cid:10   cid:6   cid:7   cid:20   cid:8   cid:12   cid:31     cid:16   cid:17   cid:18   cid:22   cid:23   cid:13   cid:10   cid:24   cid:19   cid:20   cid:19   cid:21   cid:16   cid:17   cid:18   cid:22   cid:23   cid:13   cid:10   cid:24   cid:27   cid:9   cid:16   cid:23   cid:22   cid:12   cid:10   cid:11   cid:28   15.2 Fundamental Stream Classes and Objects  749    The class template basic_iostream  derives from both basic_istream  and basic_ostream . This class template deﬁnes objects that can be used for both reading and writing.   The class template basic_streambuf  is the heart of the IOStream library. This class deﬁnes the interface to all representations that can be written to or read from by streams and is used by the other stream classes to perform the reading and writing of characters. For access to some external representation, classes are derived from basic_streambuf . See the following subsection for details.  Purpose of the Stream Buffer Classes  The IOStream library is designed with a rigid separation of responsibilities. The classes derived from basic_ios handle only formatting of the data.2 The reading and writing of characters is performed by the stream buffers maintained by the basic_ios subobjects. The stream buffers supply character buffers for reading and writing. In addition, an abstraction from the external representation, such as ﬁles or strings, is formed by the stream buffers.  Thus, stream buffers play an important role when performing I O with new external represen- tations  such as sockets or graphical user interface components , redirecting streams, or combining streams to form pipelines  for example, to compress output before writing to another stream . Also, the stream buffer synchronizes the I O when doing simultaneous I O on the same external represen- tation. The details about these techniques are explained in Section 15.12, page 819.  By using stream buffers, it is quite easy to deﬁne access to a new “external representation,” such as a new storage device. All that has to be done is to derive a new stream buffer class from basic_streambuf  or an appropriate specialization and to deﬁne functions for reading and or writing characters for this new external representation. All options for formatted I O are available automatically if a stream object is initialized to use an object of the new stream buffer class. See Section 15.13, page 826, for details of stream buffers and Section 15.13.3, page 832, for examples of how to deﬁne new stream buffers for access to special storage devices.  Detailed Class Deﬁnitions  Like all class templates in the IOStream library, the class template basic_ios  is parametrized by two arguments and is deﬁned as follows:  namespace std {  template <typename charT,  typename traits = char_traits  > class basic_ios;  }  The template arguments are the character type used by the stream classes and a class describing the traits of the character type that are used by the stream classes.  2 In fact, they don’t even do the formatting! The formatting is delegated to corresponding facets in the locale library. See Section 16.2.2, page 864, and Section 16.4, page 869, for details on facets.   750  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  Examples of traits deﬁned in the traits class are the value used to represent end-of-ﬁle3 and the instructions for how to copy or move a sequence of characters. Normally, the traits for a character type are coupled with the character type, thereby making it reasonable to deﬁne a class template that is specialized for speciﬁc character types. Hence, the traits class defaults to char_traits  if charT is the character type argument. The C++ standard library provides specializations of the class char_traits for the character types char, char16_t, char32_t, and wchar_t.4 For more details about character traits, see Section 16.1.4, page 853.  There are two instantiations of the class basic_ios  for the two character types used most  often:  namespace std {  typedef basic_ios  typedef basic_ios  wios;  ios;  The type ios corresponds to the base class of the “old-fashioned” IOStream library from AT&T and can be used for compatibility in older C++ programs.  The stream buffer class used by basic_ios is deﬁned similarly: namespace std {  template <typename charT,  typename traits = char_traits  >  class basic_streambuf; typedef basic_streambuf  typedef basic_streambuf  wstreambuf;  streambuf;  Of course, the class templates basic_istream , basic_ostream , and basic_iostream  are also parametrized with the character type and a traits class:  namespace std {  template <typename charT,  typename traits = char_traits  > class basic_istream;  template <typename charT,  typename traits = char_traits  > class basic_ostream;  template <typename charT,  typename traits = char_traits  > class basic_iostream;  }  }  }  3 I use the term end-of-ﬁle for the “end of input data.” This corresponds with the constant EOF in C. 4 Character traits for char16_t and char32_t are provided since C++11.   15.2 Fundamental Stream Classes and Objects  751  As for the other classes, there are also type deﬁnitions for the instantiations of the two most  important character types:  namespace std {  typedef basic_istream  typedef basic_istream  wistream;  istream;  typedef basic_ostream  typedef basic_ostream  wostream;  ostream;  typedef basic_iostream  typedef basic_iostream  wiostream;  iostream;  }  The types istream and ostream are the types normally used in the Western Hemisphere, where 8-bit character sets are enough.5 wchar_t allow to use character sets with more than 8 bits  see Sec- tion 16.1, page 850 . Note that for types char16_t and char32_t, no corresponding instantiations are provided by the C++ standard library.  The C++ standard library provides additional stream classes for formatted I O with ﬁles  see  Section 15.9, page 791  and strings  see Section 15.10, page 802 .  15.2.2 Global Stream Objects  Several global stream objects are deﬁned for the stream classes. These objects are for access to the standard I O channels mentioned previously for streams, with char as the character type and a set of corresponding objects for the streams using wchar_t as the character type  see Table 15.2 .  Type istream ostream ostream ostream wistream wostream wostream wostream  Purpose Reads input from the standard input channel  Name cin cout Writes “normal” output to the standard output channel cerr Writes error messages to the standard error channel clog Writes log messages to the standard logging channel wcin wcout Writes “normal” wide-character output to the standard output channel wcerr Writes wide-character error messages to the standard error channel wclog Writes wide-character log messages to the standard logging channel  Reads wide-character input from the standard input channel  Table15.2. GlobalStreamObjects  By default, these standard streams are synchronized with the standard streams of C. That is, the C++ standard library ensures that the order of mixed output with C++ streams and C streams  5 The classes istream_withassign, ostream_withassign, and iostream_withassign, which are present in some older stream libraries  derived from istream, ostream, and iostream, respectively , are not sup- ported by the standard. The corresponding functionality is achieved differently  see Section 15.12.3, page 822 .   752  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  is preserved. Before it writes data, any buffer of standard C++ streams ﬂushes the buffer of the corresponding C streams, and vice versa. Of course, this synchronization takes some time. If it isn’t necessary, you can turn it off by calling sync_with_stdio false  before any input or output is done  see Section 15.14.1, page 845 .  Since C++11, some guarantees regarding concurrency are given for these stream objects: When synchronized with the standard streams of C, using them in multiple parallel threads does not cause undeﬁned behavior. Thus, you can write from or read into multiple threads. Note, however, that this might result in interleaved characters, or the thread that gets a character read is undeﬁned. For any other stream object or if these objects are not synchronized with C streams, concurrent reads or writes result in undeﬁned behavior.  15.2.3 Header Files  and for the classes that support both input and output  basic_iostream  .6  The deﬁnitions of the stream classes are scattered among several header ﬁles:     contains forward declarations for the stream classes. This header ﬁle is necessary because it is no longer permissible to use a simple forward declaration, such as class ostream.     contains the deﬁnitions for the stream buffer base class  basic_streambuf  .     contains the deﬁnitions for the classes that support input only  basic_istream       contains the deﬁnitions for the output stream class  basic_ostream  .     contains declarations of the global stream objects, such as cin and cout. Most of the headers exist for the internal organization of the C++ standard library. For the appli- cation programmer, it should be sufﬁcient to include   for the declaration of the stream classes and   or   when using the input or output functions, respectively. The header   should be included only if the standard stream objects are to be used. For some implementations, some code is executed at start-up for each translation unit including this header. The code being executed is not that expensive, but it requires loading the corresponding pages of the executable, which might be expensive. In general, only those headers deﬁning necessary “stuff” should be included. In particular, header ﬁles should include only  , and the corresponding implementation ﬁles should then include the header with the complete deﬁnition.  For special stream features, such as parametrized manipulators, ﬁle streams, or string streams, there are additional headers:  ,  ,  , and  . The details about these headers are provided in the sections that introduce these special features.  6 At ﬁrst,   might not appear to be a logical choice for declaration of the classes for input and output. However, because there may be some initialization overhead at start-up for every translation unit that includes    see the following paragraph for details , the declarations for input and output were put into  .   15.3 Standard Stream Operators  >  753  15.3 Standard Stream Operators  >  In C and C++, operators  > are used for shifting bits of an integer to the right or the left, respectively. The classes basic_istream  and basic_ostream  overload operators >> and << as the standard I O operators. Thus, in C++, the “shift operators” became the “I O operators.”7  15.3.1 Output Operator <<  The class basic_ostream — and thus also the classes ostream and wostream — deﬁnes << as an output operator and overloads it for almost all fundamental types, excluding void and nullptr_t, as well as for char* and void*.  The output operators for streams are deﬁned to send their second argument to the corresponding  stream. Thus, the data is sent in the direction of the arrow:  int i = 7; std::cout << i;  float f = 4.5; std::cout << f;     outputs: 7     outputs: 4.5  Operator << can be overloaded such that the second argument is an arbitrary data type, thereby allowing the integration of your own data types into the I O system. The compiler ensures that the correct function for outputting the second argument is called. Of course, this function should in fact transform the second argument into a sequence of characters sent to the stream.  The C++ standard library also uses this mechanism to provide output operators for speciﬁc types, such as strings  see Section 13.3.10, page 712 , bitsets  see Section 12.5.1, page 652 , and complex numbers  see Section 17.2.3, page 933 :  std::string s "hello" ; s += ", world"; std::cout << s;     outputs: hello, world  std::bitset  flags 7 ; std::cout << flags;     outputs: 0000000111  std::complex  c 3.1,7.4 ; std::cout << c;     outputs:  3.1,7.4   The details about writing output operators for your own data types are explained in Section 15.11, page 810.  The fact that the output mechanism can be extended to incorporate your own data types is a signiﬁcant improvement over C’s I O mechanism, which uses printf  : It is not necessary to specify the type of an object to be printed. Instead, the overloading of different types ensures that  7 Some people also call the I O operators inserters and extractors.   754  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  the correct function for printing is deduced automatically. The mechanism is not limited to standard types. Thus, the user has only one mechanism, and it works for all types.  Operator << can also be used to print multiple objects in one statement. By convention, the output operators return their ﬁrst argument. Thus, the result of an output operator is the output stream. This allows you to chain calls to output operators as follows:  std::cout << x << " times " << y << " is " << x * y << std::endl;  Operator << is evaluated from left to right. Thus,  std::cout << x  is executed ﬁrst. Note that the evaluative order of the operator does not imply any speciﬁc order in which the arguments are evaluated; only the order in which the operators are executed is deﬁned. This expression returns its ﬁrst operand, std::cout. So,  std::cout << " times "  is executed next. The object y, the string literal " is ", and the result of x * y are printed accordingly. Note that the multiplication operator has a higher priority than operator <<, so you need no parentheses around x * y. However, there are operators that have lower priority, such as all logical operators. In this example, if x and y are ﬂoating-point numbers with the values 2.4 and 5.1, the following is printed:  2.4 times 5.1 is 12.24  Note that since C++11, concurrent output using the same stream object is possible but might result in interleaved characters  see Section 15.2.2, page 752 .  15.3.2 Input Operator >>  The class basic_istream — and thus also the classes istream and wistream — deﬁnes >> as an input operator. Similar to basic_ostream, this operator is overloaded for almost all fundamental types, excluding void and nullptr_t, as well as for char* and void*. The input operators for streams are deﬁned to store the value read in their second argument. As with operator <<, the data is sent in the direction of the arrow:     reads an int from standard input and stores it in i     reads a float from standard input and stores it in f  Note that the second argument is modiﬁed. To make this possible, the second argument is passed by nonconstant reference.  As with output operator <<, it is also possible to overload the input operator for arbitrary data  int i; std::cin >> i;  float f; std::cin >> f;  types and to chain the calls:  float f; std::complex  c;  std::cin >> f >> c;   15.3 Standard Stream Operators  >  755  To make this possible, leading whitespace is skipped by default. However, this automatic skipping of whitespace can be turned off  see Section 15.7.7, page 789 .  Note that since C++11, concurrent input using the same stream object is possible but might result in characters where it is not deﬁned which thread reads which character  see Section 15.2.2, page 752 .  15.3.3 Input Output of Special Types  The standard I O operators are provided for almost all fundamental types  excluding void and nullptr_t  as well as for char*, and void*. However, special rules apply to some of these types and to user-deﬁned types.  When reading numeric values, the input must start with at least one digit. Otherwise, the numeric value will be set to 0 and the failbit  see Section 15.4.1, page 758  is set:  int x; std::cin >> x;     assigns 0 to x, if the next character does not ﬁt  However, if there is no input or if the failbit is set already, calling the input operator will not modify x. This also applies to bool.  Numeric Types  Type bool  By default, Boolean values are printed and read numerically: false is converted into and from 0, and true is converted into and from 1. When reading, values different from 0 and 1 are considered to be an error. In this case, the ios::failbit is set, which might throw a corresponding exception  see Section 15.4.4, page 762 .  It is also possible to set up the formatting options of the stream to use character strings for the I O of Boolean values  see Section 15.7.2, page 781 . This touches on the topic of internationalization: Unless a special locale object is used, the strings "true" and "false" are used. In other locale objects, different strings might be used. For example, a German locale object would use the strings "wahr" and "falsch". See Chapter 16, especially Section 16.2.2, page 865, for more details.  Types char and wchar_t  When a char or a wchar_t is being read with operator >>, leading whitespace is skipped by default. To read any character, including whitespace, you can either clear the ﬂag skipws  see Section 15.7.7, page 789  or use the member function get    see Section 15.5.1, page 768 .  Type char*  A C-string  that is, a char*  is read wordwise. That is, when a C-string is being read, leading whitespace is skipped by default, and the string is read until another whitespace character or end-of-   756  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  ﬁle is encountered. Whether leading whitespace is skipped automatically can be controlled with the ﬂag skipws  see Section 15.7.7, page 789 .  Note that this behavior means that the string you read can become arbitrarily long. It is already a common error in C programs to assume that a string can be a maximum of 80 characters long. There is no such restriction. Thus, you must arrange for a premature termination of the input when the string is too long. To do this, you should always set the maximum length of the string to be read. This normally looks something like the following:  char buffer[81]; std::cin >> std::setw 81  >> buffer;     80 characters and ’\0’  The manipulator setw   and the corresponding stream parameter are described in detail in Sec- tion 15.7.3, page 781.  The type string from the C++ standard library  see Chapter 13  grows as needed to accommo- date a lengthy string. Rather than using char*, this is much easier and less error prone. In addition, strings provide a convenient function getline   for line-by-line reading  see Section 13.2.10, page 677 . So, whenever you can, avoid the use of C-strings and use strings.  Type void*  Operators  > also provide the possibility of printing a pointer and reading it back in again. An address is printed in an implementation-dependent format if a parameter of type void* is passed to the output operator. For example, the following statement prints the contents of a C-string and its address:  char* cstring = "hello";  std::cout << "string \"" << cstring << "\" is located at address: "    cstring  << std::endl;  The result of this statement might appear as follows:  string "hello" is located at address: 0x10000018  It is even possible to read an address again with the input operator. However, note that addresses are normally transient. The same object can get a different address in a newly started program. A possible application of printing and reading addresses may be programs that exchange addresses for object identiﬁcation or programs that share memory.  You can use operators >> and << to read directly into a stream buffer and to write directly out of a stream buffer respectively. This is probably the fastest way to copy ﬁles by using C++ I O streams. See Section 15.14.3, page 846, for examples.  Stream Buffers  User-Deﬁned Types  In principle, it is very easy to extend this technique to your own types. However, paying attention to all possible formatting data and error conditions takes more effort than you might think. See   15.3 Standard Stream Operators  >  757  Section 15.11, page 810, for a detailed discussion about extending the standard I O mechanism for your own types.  Monetary and Time Values  Since C++11, it is possible to use manipulators to directly read or write monetary or time values. For example, the following program allows you to write the current date and time and reads a new date:     io timemanipulator1.cpp  include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main    {     process and print current date and time: auto now = chrono::system_clock::now  ; time_t t = chrono::system_clock::to_time_t now ; tm* nowTM = localtime &t ; cout << put_time nowTM,"date: %x\ntime: %X\n"  << endl;     read date: tm* date; cout << "new date: "; cin >> get_time date,"%x" ; if  !cin  {     read date  cerr << "invalid format read" << endl;  }  }  date: 09 14 11 time: 11:08:52  Before asking for a new date, the program might output:  The corresponding manipulators allow you to take international behavior into account. For details, see Section 16.4.3, page 890, for time manipulators; Section 16.4.2, page 882, for monetary manip- ulators; and Section 5.7, page 143, for the chrono library deﬁning std::chrono::system_time.   758  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  15.4 State of Streams  Streams maintain a state. The state identiﬁes whether I O was successful and, if not, the reason for the failure.  15.4.1 Constants for the State of Streams  For the general state of streams, several constants of type iostate are deﬁned to be used as ﬂags  Table 15.3 . The type iostate is a member of the class ios_base. The exact type of the constants is an implementation detail; in other words, it is not deﬁned whether iostate is an enumeration, a type deﬁnition for an integral type, or an instantiation of the class bitset.  Constant Meaning goodbit eofbit failbit badbit  Everything is OK; none of the other bits is set End-of-ﬁle was encountered Error; an I O operation was not successful Fatal error; undeﬁned state  Table15.3. ConstantsofTypeiostate  The constant goodbit is deﬁned to have the value 0. Thus, having goodbit set means that all other bits are cleared. The name goodbit may be somewhat confusing because it doesn’t mean that any bit is set.  The difference between failbit and badbit is basically that badbit indicates a more fatal error:   failbit is set if an operation was not processed correctly but the stream is generally OK. Normally, this ﬂag is set as a result of a format error during reading. For example, this ﬂag is set if an integer is to be read but the next character is a letter.   badbit is set if the stream is somehow corrupted or if data is lost. For example, this ﬂag is set  when positioning a stream that refers to a ﬁle before the beginning of a ﬁle.  Note that eofbit normally happens with failbit because the end-of-ﬁle condition is checked and detected when an attempt is made to read beyond end-of-ﬁle. After reading the last character, the ﬂag eofbit is not yet set. The next attempt to read a character sets eofbit and failbit because the read fails.  Some former implementations supported the ﬂag hardfail. This ﬂag is not supported in the  standard.  These constants are not deﬁned globally. Instead, they are deﬁned within the class ios_base.  Thus, you must always use them with the scope operator or with some object. For example:  std::ios_base::eofbit  Of course, it is also possible to use a class derived from ios_base. These constants were deﬁned in the class ios in old implementations. Because ios is a type derived from ios_base and its use involves less typing, the use often looks like this:  std::ios::eofbit   15.4 State of Streams  759  These ﬂags are maintained by the class basic_ios and are thus present in all objects of type basic_istream or basic_ostream. However, the stream buffers don’t have state ﬂags. One stream buffer can be shared by multiple stream objects, so the ﬂags represent only the state of the stream as found in the last operation. Even this is the case only if goodbit was set prior to this operation. Otherwise, the ﬂags may have been set by an earlier operation.  15.4.2 Member Functions Accessing the State of Streams  The current state of the ﬂags can be determined by the member functions, as presented in Table 15.4.  Member Function Meaning good   eof   fail   bad   rdstate   clear   clear state  setstate state   Returns true if the stream is OK  goodbit is “set”  Returns true if end-of-ﬁle was hit  eofbit is set  Returns true if an error has occurred  failbit or badbit is set  Returns true if a fatal error has occurred  badbit is set  Returns the currently set ﬂags Clears all ﬂags Clears all and sets state ﬂags Sets additional state ﬂags  Table15.4. MemberFunctionsforStreamStates  The ﬁrst four member functions in Table 15.4 determine certain states and return a Boolean value. Note that fail   returns whether failbit or badbit is set. Although this is done mainly for historical reasons, it also has the advantage that one test sufﬁces to determine whether an error has occurred.  In addition, the state of the ﬂags can be determined and modiﬁed with the more general member functions. When clear   is called without parameters, all error ﬂags, including eofbit, are cleared  this is the origin of the name clear :     clear all error ﬂags  including eofbit : strm.clear  ;  If a parameter is given to clear  , the state of the stream is adjusted to be the state given by the parameter; that is, the ﬂags set in the parameter are set for the stream, and the other ﬂags are cleared. The only exception is that the badbit is always set if there is no stream buffer, which is the case if rdbuf   == 0  see Section 15.12.2, page 820, for details .  The following example checks whether failbit is set and clears it if necessary:    check whether failbit is set if  strm.rdstate   & std::ios::failbit  {  std::cout << "failbit was set" << std::endl;     clear only failbit strm.clear  strm.rdstate   & ~std::ios::failbit ;  }   760  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  This example uses the bit operators & and ~: Operator ~ returns the bitwise complement of its argument. Thus, the following expression returns a temporary value that has all bits set except failbit:  ~ios::failbit  Operator & returns a bitwise “and” of its operands. Only the bits set in both operands remain set. Applying bitwise “and” to all currently set ﬂags  rdstate    and to all bits except failbit retains the value of all other bits while failbit is cleared.  Streams can be conﬁgured to throw exceptions if certain ﬂags are set with clear   or setstate    see Section 15.4.4, page 762 . Such streams always throw an exception if the cor- responding ﬂag is set at the end of the method used to manipulate the ﬂags.  Note that you always have to clear error bits explicitly. In C, it was possible to read characters after a format error. For example, if scanf   failed to read an integer, you could still read the remaining characters. Thus, the read operation failed, but the input stream was still in a good state. This is different in C++. If failbit is set, each following stream operation is a no-op until failbit is cleared explicitly.  In general, the set bits reﬂect only what happened sometime in the past: If a bit is set after an operation, this does not necessarily mean that this operation caused the ﬂag to be set. Instead, the ﬂag might have been set before the operation. Thus, if it not known whether an error bit is set, you should call clear   before an operation is executed to let the ﬂags tell you what went wrong. Note however, that operations may have different effects after clearing the ﬂags. For example, even if eofbit was set by an operation, this does not mean that after clearing eofbit the operation will set eofbit again. This can be the case, for example, if the accessed ﬁle grew between the two calls.  15.4.3 Stream State and Boolean Conditions  Two functions are deﬁned for the use of streams in Boolean expressions  Table 15.5 .  Member Function operator bool    Returns whether the stream has not run into an error  Meaning  operator !      corresponds to !fail    Returns whether the stream has run into an error  corresponds to fail     Table15.5. StreamOperatorsforBooleanExpressions  With operator bool  ,8 streams can be tested in control structures in a short and idiomatic  way for their current state:  8 Before C++11, the operator was declared as operator void*  , which could cause problems such as those described in Section 15.10.1, page 805.   15.4 State of Streams  761     while the standard input stream is OK while  std::cin  {  ...  For the Boolean condition in a control structure, the type does not need a direct conversion to bool. Instead, a unique conversion to an integral type, such as int or char, or to a pointer type is sufﬁcient. The conversion to bool is often used to read objects and test for success in the same expression:  As discussed earlier, the following expression returns cin:  if  std::cin >> x  {     reading x was successful ...  std::cin >> x  So, after x is read, the statement is  if  std::cin  {  ...  Because cin is being used in the context of a condition, its operator void* is called, which returns whether the stream has run into an error.  A typical application of this technique is a loop that reads and processes objects:    as long as obj can be read while  std::cin >> obj  {     process obj  in this case, simply output it  std::cout << obj << std::endl;  } This is C’s classic ﬁlter framework for C++ objects. The loop is terminated if the failbit or badbit is set. This happens when an error occurred or at end-of-ﬁle  the attempt to read at end-of-ﬁle results in setting eofbit and failbit; see Section 15.4.1, page 758 . By default, op- erator >> skips leading whitespaces. This is normally exactly what is desired. However, if obj is of type char, whitespace is normally considered to be signiﬁcant. In this case, you can use the put   and get   member functions of streams  see Section 15.5.3, page 772  or, even better, an istreambuf_iterator  see Section 15.13.2, page 831  to implement an I O ﬁlter.  With operator !, the inverse test can be performed. The operator is deﬁned to return whether a stream has run into an error; that is, the operator returns true if failbit or badbit is set. The operator can be used like this:  if  ! std::cin  {     the stream cin is not OK ...  Like the implicit conversion to a Boolean value, this operator is often used to test for success in the same expression in which an object was read:  }  }  }  }   Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  762  }  if  !  std::cin >> x   {     the read failed ...  !std::cin >> x  is equivalent to the expression   !std::cin  >> x  This is probably not what is intended.  Here, the following expression returns cin, to which operator ! is applied:  std::cin >> x  The expression after ! must be placed within parentheses because of operator precedence rules: Without the parentheses, operator ! would be evaluated ﬁrst. In other words, the expression  Although these operators are very convenient in Boolean expressions, one oddity has to be noted:  Double “negation” does not yield the original object:   cin is a stream object of class istream.   !!cin is a Boolean value describing the state of cin. As with other features of C++, it can be argued whether the use of the conversions to a Boolean value is good style. The use of member functions, such as fail  , normally yields a more readable program:  std::cin >> x; if  std::cin.fail    {  ...  }  15.4.4 Stream State and Exceptions  Exception handling was introduced to C++ for the handling of errors and exceptions  see Section 4.3, page 41 . However, this was done after streams were already in wide use. To stay backward compat- ible, by default, streams throw no exceptions. However, for the standardized streams, it is possible to deﬁne, for every state ﬂag, whether setting that ﬂag will trigger an exception. This deﬁnition is done by the exceptions   member function  Table 15.6 .  Member Function Meaning exceptions ﬂags  exceptions    Sets ﬂags that trigger exceptions Returns the ﬂags that trigger exceptions  Table15.6. StreamMemberFunctionsforExceptions  Calling exceptions   without an argument yields the current ﬂags for which exceptions are triggered. No exceptions are thrown if the function returns goodbit. This is the default, to maintain   15.4 State of Streams  763  backward compatibility. When exceptions   is called with an argument, exceptions are thrown as soon as the corresponding state ﬂags are set. If a state ﬂag is already set when exceptions   is called with an argument, an exception is thrown if the corresponding ﬂag is set in the argument.  The following example conﬁgures the stream so that, for all ﬂags, an exception is thrown:    throw exceptions for all ‘‘errors’’ strm.exceptions  std::ios::eofbit  std::ios::failbit   std::ios::badbit ;  If 0 or goodbit is passed as an argument, no exceptions are generated:     do not generate exceptions strm.exceptions  std::ios::goodbit ;  Exceptions are thrown when the corresponding state ﬂags are set after calling clear   or setstate  . An exception is even thrown if the ﬂag was already set and not cleared:     this call throws an exception if failbit is set on entry strm.exceptions  std::ios::failbit ; ...    throw an exception  even if failbit was already set  strm.setstate  std::ios::failbit ;  The exceptions thrown are objects of the class std::ios_base::failure. Since C++11, this class is derived from std::system_error  see Section 4.3.1, page 44 .9  namespace std {  public:  class ios_base::failure : public system_error {  explicit failure  const string& msg,  const error_code& ec = io_errc::stream ;  explicit failure  const char* msg,  const error_code& ec = io_errc::stream ;  };  }  Implementations are requested to provide an error_code object that provides the speciﬁc reason for the failure. In fact, an error caused by the operating system should have the category   "system" and the value   that was reported by the operating system. An error arising from within the I O stream library should have the category   "iostream" and the value   std::io_errc::stream. See Section 4.3.2, page 45, for details about class error_code and how to deal with it.  Not throwing exceptions as default demonstrates that exception handling is intended to be used more for unexpected situations. It is called exception handling rather than error handling. Expected errors, such as format errors during input from the user, are considered to be “normal” and are usually better handled using the state ﬂags.  The major area in which stream exceptions are useful is reading preformatted data, such as automatically written ﬁles. But even then, problems arise if exception handling is used. For example,  9 Before C++11, class std::ios_base::failure was directly derived from class std::exception.   764  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  if it is desired to read data until end-of-ﬁle, you can’t get exceptions for errors without getting an exception for end-of-ﬁle. The reason is that the detection of end-of-ﬁle also sets the failbit, meaning that reading an object was not successful. To distinguish end-of-ﬁle from an input error, you have to check the state of the stream.  The next example demonstrates how this might look. It shows a function that reads ﬂoating-point values from a stream until end-of-ﬁle is reached and returns the sum of the ﬂoating-point values read:     io sum1a.cpp  include    namespace MyLib {  double readAndProcessSum  std::istream& strm  {  using std::ios; double value, sum;     save current state of exception ﬂags ios::iostate oldExceptions = strm.exceptions  ;     let failbit and badbit throw exceptions    - NOTE: failbit is also set at end-of-ﬁle strm.exceptions  ios::failbit  ios::badbit ;  try {     while stream is OK    - read value and add it to sum sum = 0; while  strm >> value  {  sum += value;  }  } catch  ...  {     if exception not caused by end-of-ﬁle    - restore old state of exception ﬂags    - rethrow exception if  !strm.eof    {  }  }     restore old state of exception ﬂags strm.exceptions  oldExceptions ;  strm.exceptions oldExceptions ; throw;     restore exception ﬂags    rethrow   15.4 State of Streams  765     return sum return sum;  }  }  First, the function stores the set stream exceptions in oldExceptions to restore them later. Then the stream is conﬁgured to throw an exception on certain conditions. In a loop, all values are read and added as long as the stream is OK. If end-of-ﬁle is reached, the stream is no longer OK, and a corresponding exception is thrown even though no exception is thrown for setting eofbit. This happens because end-of-ﬁle is detected on an unsuccessful attempt to read more data, which also sets the failbit. To avoid the behavior that end-of-ﬁle throws an exception, the exception is caught locally to check the state of the stream by using eof  . The exception is propagated only if eof   yields false.  Note that restoring the original exception ﬂags may cause exceptions: exceptions   throws an exception if a corresponding ﬂag is set in the stream already. Thus, if the state did throw exceptions for eofbit, failbit, or badbit on function entry, these exceptions are propagated to the caller.  This function can be called in the simplest case from the following main function:  double readAndProcessSum  std::istream& ;     io summain.cpp  include   include   include    namespace MyLib {  }  int main   {  try {  using namespace std; double sum;  sum = MyLib::readAndProcessSum cin ;  } catch  const ios::failure& error  {  cerr << "I O exception: " << error.what   << endl; return EXIT_FAILURE;  } catch  const exception& error  {  cerr << "standard exception: " << error.what   << endl; return EXIT_FAILURE;  }   766  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  catch  ...  {  cerr << "unknown exception" << endl; return EXIT_FAILURE;  }  }     print sum cout << "sum: " << sum << endl;  The question arises whether this is worth the effort. It is also possible to work with streams not throwing an exception. In this case, an exception is thrown if an error is detected. This has the additional advantage that user-deﬁned error messages and error classes can be used:     io sum2a.cpp  include    namespace MyLib {  double readAndProcessSum  std::istream& strm  {  double value, sum;     while stream is OK    - read value and add it to sum sum = 0; while  strm >> value  {  sum += value;  }  }  if  !strm.eof    {  throw std::ios::failure   "input error in readAndProcessSum  " ;     return sum return sum;  }  }  This looks somewhat simpler, doesn’t it?   15.5 Standard Input Output Functions  767  I O Exceptions before C++11  Before C++11, class std::ios_base::failure was directly derived from class std::exception and had only a constructor taking a std::string argument:  class ios_base::failure : public exception {  explicit failure  const string& msg ; ...  namespace std {  public:  };  }  This caused the following limitations:   For the generated exception object, it was possible to call what   only to get an implementation- speciﬁc string for the reason of the failure. No support for an exception category or value was provided.   Because the constructor did take only a std::string, you had to include   when passing a string literal.  To enable the conversion to std::string, you need the declaration of the corresponding string constructor.   15.5 Standard Input Output Functions  Instead of using the standard operators for streams  operator  > , you can use the member functions presented in this section for reading and writing. These functions read or write “unformatted” data, unlike operators >> or <<, which read or write “formatted” data. When read- ing, the functions described in this section never skip leading whitespaces, which is different to operator >>, which, by default, skips leading whitespace. This is handled by a sentry object  see Section 15.5.4, page 772 . Also, these functions handle exceptions differently from the formatted I O operators: If an exception is thrown, either from a called function or as a result of setting a state ﬂag  see Section 15.4.4, page 762 , the badbit ﬂag is set. The exception is then rethrown if the exception mask has badbit set.  The standard I O functions use type streamsize, which is deﬁned in  , to specify counts: namespace std {  typedef ... streamsize; ...  }  The type streamsize usually is a signed version of size_t. It is signed because it is also used to specify negative values.   768  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  15.5.1 Member Functions for Input  In the following deﬁnitions, istream is a placeholder for the stream class used for reading. It can stand for istream, wistream, or other instantiation of the class template basic_istream . The type char is a placeholder for the corresponding character type, which is char for istream and wchar_t for wistream. Other types or values printed in italics depend on the exact deﬁnition of the character type or on the traits class associated with the stream.  For istreams, the C++ standard library provides several member functions to read character se- quences. Table 15.7 compares their abilities  s refers to the character sequence the characters are read into .  Member Function get s,num  get s,num,t  getline s,num  getline s,num,t  read s,num  readsome s,num   Reads Until Excluding newline or end-of-ﬁle Up to num-1 Yes Up to num-1 Yes Excluding t or end-of-ﬁle Including newline or end-of-ﬁle Up to num-1 Yes Up to num-1 Yes Including t or end-of-ﬁle No End-of-ﬁle num Up to num No End-of-ﬁle  Appends Terminator Returns istream istream istream istream istream Count  Number of Characters  Table15.7. AbilitiesofStreamOperatorsReadingCharacterSequences  int istream::get      Reads the next character.   Returns the read character or EOF.   In general,  the return type is traits::int_type, and EOF is the value returned by traits::eof  . For istream, the return type is int, and EOF is the constant EOF. Hence, for istream, this function corresponds to C’s getchar   or getc  .   Note that the returned value is not necessarily of the character type but can be of a type with a larger range of values. Otherwise, it would be impossible to distinguish EOF from characters with the corresponding value.  istream& istream::get  char& c    Assigns the next character to the passed argument c.   Returns the stream. The stream’s state tells whether the read was successful.  istream& istream::get  char* str, streamsize count  istream& istream::get  char* str, streamsize count, char delim    Both forms read up to count-1 characters into the character sequence pointed to by str.   The ﬁrst form terminates the reading if the next character to be read is the newline character of the corresponding character set. For istream, it is the character ’\n’, and for wistream,   15.5 Standard Input Output Functions  769  it is wchar_t ’\n’   see Section 16.1.5, page 857 . In general, widen ’\n’  is used  see Section 15.8, page 790 .    The second form terminates the reading if the next character to be read is delim.   Both forms return the stream. The stream’s state tells whether the read was successful.   The terminating character  delim  is not read.   The read character sequence is terminated by a  terminating  null character.   The caller must ensure that str is large enough for count characters.  istream& istream::getline  char* str, streamsize count  istream& istream::getline  char* str, streamsize count, char delim    Both forms are identical to their previous counterparts of get  , except as follows:  – They terminate the reading including but not before the newline character or delim, respec- tively. Thus, the newline character or delim is read if it occurs within count-1 characters, but it is not stored in str.  – If they read lines with more than count-1 characters, they set failbit.  istream& istream::read  char* str, streamsize count    Reads count characters into the string str.   Returns the stream. The stream’s state tells whether the read was successful.   The string in str is not terminated automatically with a  terminating  null character.   The caller must ensure that str has sufﬁcient space to store count characters.   Encountering end-of-ﬁle during reading is considered an error, and failbit is set in addition to  eofbit.  streamsize istream::readsome  char* str, streamsize count    Reads up to count characters into the string str.   Returns the number of characters read.   The string in str is not terminated automatically with a  terminating  null character.   The caller must ensure that str has sufﬁcient space to store count characters.   In contrast to read  , readsome   reads all available characters of the stream buffer, using the in_avail   member function of the buffer  see Section 15.13.1, page 827 . This is useful when it is undesirable to wait for the input because it comes from the keyboard or other processes. Encountering end-of-ﬁle is not considered an error and sets neither eofbit nor failbit.  streamsize istream::gcount    const   Returns the number of characters read by the last unformatted read operation.   770  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  istream& istream::ignore    istream& istream::ignore  streamsize count  istream& istream::ignore  streamsize count, int delim    All forms extract and discard characters.   The ﬁrst form ignores one character.   The second form ignores up to count characters.   The third form ignores up to count characters until delim is extracted and discarded.   If count is std::numeric_limits ::max    the largest value of type std::streamsize; see Section 5.3, page 115 , all characters are discarded until either delim or end-of-ﬁle is reached.    All forms return the stream.   Examples:  – The following call discards the rest of the line:  cin.ignore numeric_limits ::max  ,’\n’ ;  – The following call discards the complete remainder of cin:  cin.ignore numeric_limits ::max   ;  int istream::peek      Returns the next character to be read from the stream without extracting it. The next read will   Returns EOF if no more characters can be read.   EOF is the value returned from traits::eof  . For istream, this is the constant EOF.  read this character  unless the read position is modiﬁed .  read  unless the read position is modiﬁed .  istream& istream::unget    istream& istream::putback  char c    Both functions put the last character read back into the stream so that it is read again by the next   The difference between unget   and putback   is that for putback  , a check is made   If the character cannot be put back or if the wrong character is put back with putback  , badbit   The maximum number of characters that can be put back with these functions is unspeciﬁed. Only one call of these functions between two reads is guaranteed to work by the standard and thus is portable.  is set, which may throw a corresponding exception  see Section 15.4.4, page 762 .  whether the character c passed is indeed the last character read.  When C-strings are read, it is safer to use the functions from this section than to use operator >>. The reason is that the maximum string size to be read must be passed explicitly as an argument. Although it is possible to limit the number of characters read when using operator >>  see Section 15.7.3, page 781 , this is easily forgotten.   15.5 Standard Input Output Functions  771  It is often better to use the stream buffer directly instead of using istream member functions. Stream buffers provide member functions that read single characters or character sequences efﬁ- ciently, without overhead due to the construction of sentry objects  see Section 15.5.4, page 772, for more information on sentry objects . Section 15.13, page 826, explains the stream buffer in- terface in detail. Another alternative is to use the class template istreambuf_iterator , which provides an iterator interface to the stream buffer  see Section 15.13.2, page 828 .  Two other functions for manipulating the read position are tellg   and seekg  , which are rel- evant mainly in conjunction with ﬁles. Their descriptions are deferred until Section 15.9.4, page 799.  15.5.2 Member Functions for Output  In the following deﬁnitions, ostream is a placeholder for the stream class used for writing. It can stand for ostream, wostream, or other instantiation of the class template basic_ostream . The type char is a placeholder for the corresponding character type, which is char for ostream and wchar_t for wostream. Other types or values printed in italics depend on the exact deﬁnition of the character type or on the traits class associated with the stream.  ostream& ostream::put  char c    Writes the argument c to the stream.   Returns the stream. The stream’s state tells whether the write was successful.  ostream& ostream::write  const char* str, streamsize count    Writes count characters of the string str to the stream.   Returns the stream. The stream’s state tells whether the write was successful.   The  terminating  null character does not terminate the write and will be written.   The caller must ensure that str contains at least count characters; otherwise, the behavior is  undeﬁned.  to which it belongs.  ostream& ostream::ﬂush      Flushes the buffers of the stream: forces a write of all buffered data to the device or I O channel  Two other functions modify the write position: tellp   and seekp  , which are relevant mainly in conjunction with ﬁles. Their descriptions are deferred until Section 15.9.4, page 799.  As with the input functions, it may be reasonable to use the stream buffer directly  see Sec- tion 15.14.3, page 846  or to use the class template ostreambuf_iterator  for unformatted writing  see Section 15.13.2, page 828 . In fact, there is no point in using the unformatted output functions except that they use sentry objects  see Section 15.5.4, page 772 , which, for example, synchronize tied output streams  see Section 15.12.1, page 819 .   772  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  The classic C UNIX ﬁlter framework that simply writes all read characters looks like this in C++:  15.5.3 Example Uses     io charcat1.cpp  include   using namespace std;  int main   {  char c;     while it is possible to read a character while  cin.get c   {     print it cout.put c ;  }  }  cin.get c   With each call of the following expression, the next character is simply assigned to c, which is passed by reference:  The return value of get   is the stream; thus, while tests whether cin is still in a good state.10  For a better performance, you can operate directly on stream buffers. See Section 15.13.2, page 831, for a version of this example that uses stream buffer iterators for I O and Section 15.14.3, page 846, for a version that copies the whole input in one statement.  15.5.4 sentry Objects  The I O stream operators and functions use a common scheme for providing their functionality: First, some preprocessing prepares the stream for I O. Then the actual I O is done, followed by some postprocessing.  To implement this scheme, classes basic_istream and basic_ostream each deﬁne an aux- iliary class sentry. The constructor of these classes does the preprocessing, and the destructor  10 Note that this interface is better than the usual C interface for ﬁlters. In C, you have to use getchar   or getc  , which return both the next character or whether end-of-ﬁle was reached. This causes the problem that you have to process the return value as int to distinguish any char value from the value for end-of-ﬁle.   15.5 Standard Input Output Functions  773  does the corresponding postprocessing.11 Thus, all formatted and unformatted I O operators and functions use a sentry object before they perform their actual processing and operate as follows:  sentry se strm ; if  se  {  ...  }     indirect pre- and postprocessing     the actual processing  The sentry object takes as the constructor argument the stream strm, on which the pre- and post- processing should be done. The remaining processing then depends on the state of this object, which indicates whether the stream is OK. This state can be checked using the conversion of the sentry object to bool. For input streams, the sentry object can be constructed with an optional Boolean value that indicates whether skipping of whitespace should be avoided even though the ﬂag skipws is set:  sentry se strm,true ;     don’t skip whitespaces during the additional processing  The pre- and postprocessing perform all general tasks of I O using streams. These tasks include synchronizing several streams, checking whether the stream is OK, and skipping whitespaces, as well as possibly implementation-speciﬁc tasks. For example, in a multithreaded environment, the additional processing might be used for corresponding locking.  If an I O operator operates directly on the stream buffer, a corresponding sentry object should  be constructed ﬁrst.  11 These classes replace the member functions that were used in former implementations of the IOStream library  ipfx  , isfx  , opfx  , and osfx   . Using the new classes ensures that the postprocessing is invoked even if the I O is aborted with an exception.   774  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  15.6 Manipulators  Manipulators for streams, introduced in Section 15.1.5, page 746, are objects that modify a stream when applied with the standard I O operators. This does not necessarily mean that something is read or written. The basic manipulators deﬁned in   or   are presented in Table 15.8.  Manipulator Class endl  basic_ostream  Meaning Inserts a newline character into the buffer and ﬂushes the output buffer to its device Inserts a  terminating  null character into the buffer Flushes the output buffer to its device  basic_ostream basic_ostream basic_istream Reads and ignores whitespaces  ends flush ws  Table15.8. ManipulatorsDeﬁnedin  or    Manipulators with Arguments  Some of the manipulators process arguments. For example, you can use the following to set the minimum ﬁeld width of the next output and the ﬁll character:  std::cout << std::setw 6  << std::setfill ’_’ ;  The standard manipulators with arguments are deﬁned in the header ﬁle  , which must be included to work with the standard manipulators taking arguments:  include    The standard manipulators taking arguments are all concerned with details of formatting, so they are described when general formatting options  see Section 15.7, page 779 , time formatting  see Section 16.4.3, page 890 , or monetary formatting  see Section 16.4.2, page 882  are introduced.  15.6.1 Overview of All Manipulators  Table 15.9 gives an overview of all manipulators provided by the C++ standard library, includ- ing the page where you can ﬁnd details. hexfloat, defaultfloat, put_time  , get_time  , put_money  , and get_money   are provided since C++11.   15.6 Manipulators  Effect Writes a newline character and ﬂushes the output Writes a  terminating  null character Flushes the output Reads and ignores whitespaces Skips leading whitespaces with operator >> Does not skip leading whitespaces with operator >> Flushes the output buffer after each write operation Does not ﬂush the output buffer after each write operation Sets ﬂags as format ﬂags Clears all ﬂags of the group identiﬁed by mask m Sets the ﬁeld width of the next input and output to val Deﬁnes c as the ﬁll character Left-adjusts values Right-adjusts values Left-adjusts signs and right-adjusts values Forces textual representation for Boolean values Forces numeric representation for Boolean values Forces writing a positive sign on positive numbers Forces not writing a positive sign on positive numbers Forces uppercase letters for numeric values Forces lowercase letters for numeric values Reads and writes integral values octal Reads and writes integral values decimal Reads and writes integral values hexadecimal Indicates numeric base of numeric values Does not indicate numeric base of numeric values Always writes a decimal point for ﬂoating-point values Does not require a decimal point for ﬂoating-point values Sets val as the new value for the precision of ﬂoating-point values Uses decimal notation for ﬂoating-point values Uses scientiﬁc notation for ﬂoating-point values Uses hexadecimal scientiﬁc notation for ﬂoating-point values Uses normal ﬂoating-point notation  Manipulator endl ends flush ws skipws noskipws unitbuf nounitbuf setiosflags ﬂags  resetiosflags m  setw val  setfill c  left right internal boolalpha noboolalpha showpos noshowpos uppercase nouppercase oct dec hex showbase noshowbase showpoint noshowpoint setprecision val  fixed scientific hexfloat defaultfloat put_time val,fmt  Writes a date time value according to the format fmt Reads a time date value according to the format fmt get_time val,fmt  Writes a monetary value using the local currency symbol put_money val  put_money val,intl  Writes a monetary value using the currency symbol according to  get_money val  get_money val,intl  Reads a monetary value using the currency symbol according to  intl Reads a monetary value using the local currency symbol  intl  Table15.9.

Manipulators are nothing more than functions passed to the I O operators as arguments. The functions are then called by the operator. For example, the output operator for class ostream is basically overloaded like this:  ostream& ostream::operator <<   ostream&  *op  ostream&   {     call the function passed as parameter with this stream as the argument return  *op  *this ;  The argument op is a pointer to a function that takes ostream as an argument and returns ostream  it is assumed that the ostream given as the argument is returned . If the second operand of operator << is such a function, this function is called with the ﬁrst operand of operator << as the argument.  This may sound very complicated, but it is relatively simple. An example should make it clearer. The manipulator — that is, the function — endl   for ostream is implemented basically like this:  std::ostream& std::endl  std::ostream& strm  {  }  }     write newline strm.put ’\n’ ;     ﬂush the output buffer strm.flush  ;     return strm to allow chaining return strm;  You can use this manipulator in an expression such as the following:  std::cout << std::endl  Here, operator << is called for stream cout with the endl   function as the second operand. The implementation of operator << transforms this call into a call of the passed function with the stream as the argument:  std::endl std::cout   The same effect as “writing” the manipulator can also be achieved by calling this expression directly. An advantage to using the function notation is that it is not necessary to provide the namespace for the manipulator:  endl std::cout   The reason is that, according to ADL  argument-dependent lookup, also known as Koenig lookup , functions are looked up in the namespaces where their arguments are deﬁned if they are not found otherwise.   15.6 Manipulators  777  Because the stream classes are class templates parametrized with the character type, the real  implementation of endl   looks like this:  template   std::basic_ostream & std::endl  std::basic_ostream & strm  {  strm.put strm.widen ’\n’  ; strm.flush  ; return strm;  The member function widen   is used to convert the newline character into the character set cur- rently used by the stream. See Section 15.8, page 790, for more details.  How the manipulators with arguments work exactly is implementation dependent, and there is no standard way to implement user-deﬁned manipulators with arguments  see the next section for an example .  15.6.3 User-Deﬁned Manipulators  To deﬁne your own manipulator, you simply need to write a function such as endl  . For example, the following function deﬁnes a manipulator that ignores all characters until end-of-line:     io ignore1.hpp  include   include    template   inline std::basic_istream & ignoreLine  std::basic_istream & strm  {     skip until end-of-line strm.ignore std::numeric_limits ::max  ,  strm.widen ’\n’  ;     return stream for concatenation return strm;  }  }  The manipulator simply delegates the work to the function ignore  , which in this case discards all characters until end-of-line  ignore   was introduced in Section 15.5.1, page 770 .   778  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  The application of the manipulator is very simple:     ignore the rest of the line std::cin >> ignoreLine;  Applying this manipulator multiple times enables you to ignore multiple lines:     ignore two lines std::cin >> ignoreLine >> ignoreLine;  This works because a call to the function ignore max,c  ignores all characters until the c is found in the input stream, or max characters are read or the end of the stream was reached. However, this character is discarded, too, before the function returns.  As written, there are multiple ways to deﬁne your own manipulator taking arguments. For exam-  ple, the following code ignores n lines:     io ignore2.hpp  include   include    class ignoreLine {  private:  int num;  public:  explicit ignoreLine  int n=1  : num n  { }  template   friend std::basic_istream & operator>>  std::basic_istream & strm,  const ignoreLine& ign      skip until end-of-line num times for  int i=0; i<ign.num; ++i  {  strm.ignore std::numeric_limits ::max  ,  strm.widen ’\n’  ;     return stream for concatenation return strm;  {  }  }  };  Here, the manipulator ignoreLine is a class, which takes the argument to get initialized, and the input operator is overloaded for objects of this class.   15.7 Formatting  15.7 Formatting  779  Two concepts inﬂuence the deﬁnition of I O formats: Most obviously, there are format ﬂags that deﬁne, for example, numeric precision, the ﬁll character, or the numeric base. Apart from this, there exists the possibility of adjusting formats to meet special national conventions. This section introduces the format ﬂags. Section 15.8, page 790, and Chapter 16 describe the aspects of interna- tionalized formatting.  15.7.1 Format Flags  The classes ios_base and basic_ios  have several members that are used for the deﬁnition of various I O formats. For example, some members store the minimum ﬁeld width or the precision of ﬂoating-point numbers or the ﬁll character. A member of type ios::fmtflags stores conﬁguration ﬂags deﬁning, for example, whether positive numbers should be preceded by a positive sign or whether Boolean values should be printed numerically or as words.  Some of the format ﬂags form groups. For example, the ﬂags for octal, decimal, and hexadecimal formats of integer numbers form a group. Special masks are deﬁned to make dealing with such groups easier.  Member Function Meaning setf ﬂags  setf ﬂags, grp   Sets ﬂags as additional ﬂags and returns the previous state of all ﬂags Sets ﬂags as the new ﬂags of the group identiﬁed by grp and returns the previous state of all ﬂags Clears ﬂags Returns all set format ﬂags Sets ﬂags as the new ﬂags and returns the previous state of all ﬂags Copies all format deﬁnitions from stream  unsetf ﬂags  flags   flags ﬂags  copyfmt stream   Table15.10. MemberFunctiontoAccessFormatFlags  Several member functions can be used to handle all the format deﬁnitions of a stream  see Ta- ble 15.10 . The functions setf   and unsetf   set or clear, respectively, one or more ﬂags. You can manipulate multiple ﬂags at once by combining them, using the “binary or” operator; that is, operator . The function setf   can take a mask as the second argument to clear all ﬂags in a group before setting the ﬂags of the ﬁrst argument, which are also limited to a group. This does not happen with the version of setf   that takes only one argument. For example:     set ﬂags showpos and uppercase std::cout.setf  std::ios::showpos  std::ios::uppercase ;     set only the ﬂag hex in the group basefield std::cout.setf  std::ios::hex, std::ios::basefield ;     clear the ﬂag uppercase std::cout.unsetf  std::ios::uppercase ;   780  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  Using flags  , you can manipulate all format ﬂags at once. Calling flags   without an argument returns the current format ﬂags. Calling flags   with an argument takes this argument as the new state of all format ﬂags and returns the old state. Thus, flags   with an argument clears all ﬂags and sets the ﬂags that were passed. Using flags   is useful, for example, for saving the current state of the ﬂags to restore the original state later. The following statements demonstrate an example:  using std::ios; using std::cout;     save current format ﬂags ios::fmtflags oldFlags = cout.flags  ;     do some changes cout.setf ios::showpos  ios::showbase  ios::uppercase ; cout.setf ios::internal, ios::adjustfield ; cout << std::hex << x << std::endl;     restore saved format ﬂags cout.flags oldFlags ;  By using copyfmt   you can copy all the format information from one stream to another. See Section 15.11.1, page 811, for an example.  You can also use manipulators to set and clear format ﬂags. These are presented in Table 15.11.  Manipulator setiosflags ﬂags  resetiosflags mask  Clears all ﬂags of the group identiﬁed by mask  calls setf 0,mask   Effect Sets ﬂags as format ﬂags  calls setf ﬂags  for the stream   for the stream   Table15.11. ManipulatorstoAccessFormatFlags  The manipulators setiosflags   and resetiosflags   provide the possibility of setting or clearing, respectively, one or more ﬂags in a write or read statement with operator  >, re- spectively. To use one of these manipulators, you must include the header ﬁle  . For example:  include   include   ... std::cout << resetiosflags std::ios::adjustfield     clear adjustm. ﬂags  << setiosflags std::ios::left ;     left-adjust values  Some ﬂag manipulations are performed by specialized manipulators. These manipulators are used often because they are more convenient and more readable. They are discussed in the following subsections.   15.7 Formatting  781  15.7.2 Input Output Format of Boolean Values  The boolalpha ﬂag deﬁnes the format used to read or to write Boolean values. It deﬁnes whether a numeric or a textual representation is used for Boolean values  Table 15.12 .  Flag boolalpha  Meaning If set, speciﬁes the use of textual representation; if not set, speciﬁes the use of numeric representation  Table15.12. FlagforBooleanRepresentation  If the ﬂag is not set  the default , Boolean values are represented using numeric strings. In this case, the value 0 is always used for false, and the value 1 is always used for true. When reading a Boolean value as a numeric string, it is considered to be an error  setting failbit for the stream  if the value differs from 0 or 1.  If the ﬂag is set, Boolean values are written using a textual representation. When a Boolean value is read, the string has to match the textual representation of either true or false. The stream’s locale object is used to determine the strings used to represent true and false  see Section 15.8, page 790, and Section 16.2.2, page 865 . The standard "C" locale object uses the strings "true" and "false" as representations of the Boolean values.  Special manipulators are deﬁned for the convenient manipulation of this ﬂag  Table 15.13 .  Manipulator boolalpha noboolalpha  Meaning Forces textual representation  sets the ﬂag ios::boolalpha  Forces numeric representation  clears the ﬂag ios::boolalpha   Table15.13. ManipulatorsforBooleanRepresentation  For example, the following statements print b ﬁrst in numeric and then in textual representation:  bool b; ... std::cout << std::noboolalpha << b << " == "  << std::boolalpha << b << std::endl;  15.7.3 Field Width, Fill Character, and Adjustment  Two member functions are used to deﬁne the ﬁeld width and the ﬁll character: width   and fill    Table 15.14 .   782  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  Member Function Meaning width   width val   fill   fill c   Returns the current ﬁeld width Sets the ﬁeld width for the next formatted output to val and returns the previous ﬁeld width Returns the current ﬁll character Deﬁnes c as the ﬁll character and returns the previous ﬁll character  Table15.14. MemberFunctionsfortheFieldWidthandtheFillCharacter  Using Field Width, Fill Character, and Adjustment for Output  For the output, width   deﬁnes a minimum ﬁeld. This deﬁnition applies only to the next formatted ﬁeld written. Calling width   without arguments returns the current ﬁeld width. Calling width   with an integral argument changes the width and returns the former value. The default value for the minimum ﬁeld width is 0, which means that the ﬁeld may have any length. This is also the value to which the ﬁeld width is set after a value was written.  Note that the ﬁeld width is never used to truncate output. Thus, you can’t specify a maximum ﬁeld width. Instead, you have to program it. For example, you could write to a string and output only a certain number of characters.  The member function fill   deﬁnes the ﬁll character that is used to ﬁll the difference between the formatted representation of a value and the minimum ﬁeld width. The default ﬁll character is a space.  To adjust values within a ﬁeld, three ﬂags are deﬁned, as shown in Table 15.15. These ﬂags are  deﬁned in the class ios_base together with the corresponding mask.  Mask adjustfield  Flag left right internal None  Meaning Left-adjusts the value Right-adjusts the value Left-adjusts the sign and right-adjusts the value Right-adjusts the value  the default   Table15.15. MaskstoAdjustValueswithinaField  Table 15.16 presents the effect of the functions and the ﬂags used for various values. The underscore is used as the ﬁll character.  width   -42  Adjustment left right internal  6 6 6  -42___ ___-42 -___42  0.12 0.12__ __0.12 __0.12  "Q" Q_____ _____Q _____Q  ’Q’ Q_____ _____Q _____Q  Table15.16. ExamplesofAdjustments   15.7 Formatting  783  After any formatted I O operation is performed, the default ﬁeld width is restored. The values of the ﬁll character and the adjustment remain unchanged until they are modiﬁed explicitly.  Several manipulators are deﬁned to handle the ﬁeld width, the ﬁll character, and the adjustment   Table 15.17 .  Manipulator Meaning setw val  setfill c  left right internal  Sets the ﬁeld width of the next input and output to val  corresponds to width    Deﬁnes c as the ﬁll character  corresponds to fill    Left-adjusts the value Right-adjusts the value Left-adjusts the sign and right-adjusts the value  Table15.17. ManipulatorsforAdjustment  The manipulators setw   and setfill   use an argument, so you must include the header ﬁle   to use them. For example, the statements  include   include   ... std::cout << std::setw 8  << std::setfill ’_’  << -3.14  << ’ ’ << 42 << std::endl; std::cout << std::setw 8  << "sum: "  << std::setw 8  << 42 << std::endl;  produce this output:  ___-3.14 42 ___sum: ______42  Using Field Width for Input  You can also use the ﬁeld width to deﬁne the maximum number of characters read when character sequences of type char* are read. If the value of width   is not 0, at most width  -1 characters are read.  Because ordinary C-strings can’t grow while values are read, width   or setw   should always  be used when reading them with operator >>. For example:  char buffer[81];     read, at most, 80 characters: cin >> setw sizeof buffer   >> buffer;  This reads at most 80 characters, although sizeof buffer  is 81 because one character is used for the  terminating  null character, which is appended automatically. Note that the following code is a common error: char* s; cin >> setw sizeof s   >> s;     RUNTIME ERROR   784  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  The reason is that s is declared only as a pointer without any storage for characters, and sizeof s  is the size of the pointer instead of the size of the storage to which it points. This is a typical example of the problems you encounter if you use C-strings. By using strings, you won’t run into these problems:  string buffer; cin >> buffer;     OK  15.7.4 Positive Sign and Uppercase Letters  Two format ﬂags are deﬁned to inﬂuence the general appearance of numeric values: showpos and uppercase  Table 15.18 .  Flag showpos uppercase Uses uppercase letters  Meaning Writes a positive sign on positive numbers  Table15.18. FlagsAffectingSignandLettersofNumericValues  Using ios::showpos dictates that a positive sign for positive numeric values be written. If the ﬂag is not set, only negative values are written with a sign. Using ios::uppercase dictates that letters in numeric values be written using uppercase letters. This ﬂag applies to integers using hexadecimal format and to ﬂoating-point numbers using scientiﬁc notation. By default, letters are written as lowercase, and no positive sign is written. For example, the statements  std::cout << 12345678.9 << std::endl;  std::cout.setf  std::ios::showpos  std::ios::uppercase ; std::cout << 12345678.9 << std::endl;  produce this output:  1.23457e+07 +1.23457E+07  Both ﬂags can be set or cleared using the manipulators presented in Table 15.19.  Manipulator showpos  noshowpos uppercase nouppercase  Meaning Forces writing a positive sign on positive numbers  sets the ﬂag ios::showpos  Forces not writing a positive sign  clears the ﬂag ios::showpos  Forces uppercase letters  sets the ﬂag ios::uppercase  Forces lowercase letters  clears the ﬂag ios::uppercase   Table15.19. ManipulatorsforSignandLettersofNumericValues   15.7 Formatting  15.7.5 Numeric Base  785  A group of three ﬂags deﬁnes which base is used for I O of integer values. The ﬂags are deﬁned in the class ios_base with the corresponding mask  Table 15.20 .  Mask basefield  Flag Meaning oct Writes and reads octal dec Writes and reads decimal  default  hex Writes and reads hexadecimal None Writes decimal and reads according to the leading characters  of the integral value  Table15.20. FlagsDeﬁningtheBaseofIntegralValues  A change in base applies to the processing of all integer numbers until the ﬂags are reset. By default, decimal format is used. There is no support for binary notation. However, you can read and write integral values in binary by using class bitset. See Section 12.5.1, page 652, for details.  If none of the base ﬂags is set, output uses a decimal base. If more than one ﬂag is set, decimal  is used as the base.  The ﬂags for the numeric base also affect input. If one of the ﬂags for the numeric base is set, all numbers are read using this base. If no ﬂag for the base is set when numbers are read, the base is determined by the leading characters: A number starting with 0x or 0X is read as a hexadecimal number. A number starting with 0 is read as an octal number. In all other cases, the number is read as a decimal value.  There are two ways to switch these ﬂags:  1. Clear one ﬂag and set another:  std::cout.unsetf  std::ios::dec ; std::cout.setf  std::ios::hex ;  2. Set one ﬂag and clear all other ﬂags in the group automatically:  std::cout.setf  std::ios::hex, std::ios::basefield ;  In addition, the C++ standard library provides manipulators that make handling these ﬂags signiﬁ- cantly simpler  Table 15.21 .  Manipulator Meaning oct dec hex  Writes and reads octal Writes and reads decimal Writes and reads hexadecimal  Table15.21. ManipulatorsDeﬁningtheBaseofIntegralValues   786  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  For example, the following statements write x and y in hexadecimal and z in decimal:  int x, y, z; ... std::cout << std::hex << x << std::endl; std::cout << y << ’ ’ << std::dec << z << std::endl;  An additional ﬂag, showbase, lets you write numbers according to the usual C C++ convention for indicating numeric bases of literal values  Table 15.22 .  Flag showbase  Meaning If set, indicates the numeric base  Table15.22. FlagstoIndicatetheNumericBase  If ios::showbase is set, octal numbers are preceded by a 0, and hexadecimal numbers are  preceded by 0x or, if ios::uppercase is set, by OX. For example, the statements  std::cout << 127 << ’ ’ << 255 << std::endl;  std::cout << std::hex << 127 << ’ ’ << 255 << std::endl;  std::cout.setf std::ios::showbase ; std::cout << 127 << ’ ’ << 255 << std::endl;  std::cout.setf std::ios::uppercase ; std::cout << 127 << ’ ’ << 255 << std::endl;  produce this output:  127 255 7f ff 0x7f 0xff 0X7F 0XFF  Note that ios::showbase can also be manipulated using the manipulators presented in Table 15.23.  Manipulator Meaning showbase noshowbase  Indicates numeric base  sets the ﬂag ios::showbase  Does not indicate numeric base  clears the ﬂag ios::showbase   Table15.23. ManipulatorstoIndicatetheNumericBase   15.7 Formatting  787  15.7.6 Floating-Point Notation  Several ﬂags and members control the output of ﬂoating-point values. The ﬂags, presented in Ta- ble 15.24, deﬁne whether output is written using decimal or scientiﬁc notation. These ﬂags are deﬁned in the class ios_base together with the corresponding mask. If ios::fixed is set, ﬂoating- point values are printed using decimal notation. If ios::scientific is set, scientiﬁc — that is, exponential — notation is used.  Mask floatfield  Meaning Flag s  Uses decimal notation fixed Uses scientiﬁc notation scientific Uses the “best” of these two notations  default  None fixedscientific Hexadecimal scientiﬁc notation  since C++11   Table15.24. FlagsforFloating-PointNotation  Before C++11, specifying fixedscientific was not deﬁned. Since C++11, this can be used to deﬁne a hexadecimal scientiﬁc notation, which also the format speciﬁer %a provides for printf  : a hexadecimal value to the power of 2. For example, 234.5 is written as 0x1.d5p+7  0x1.d5 times 27, which is 1* 128  16 + 5* 128 256  .  1 + 13* 128  Using the ﬂag showpoint, you can force the stream to write a decimal point and trailing zeros  until places according to the current precision are written  Table 15.25 .  Flag showpoint Always writes a decimal point and ﬁlls up with trailing zeros  Meaning  Table15.25. FlagtoForceDecimalPoint  To deﬁne the precision, the member function precision   is provided  see Table 15.26 .  Member Function Meaning precision   precision val   Returns the current precision of ﬂoating-point values Sets val as the new precision of ﬂoating-point values and returns the old  Table15.26. MemberFunctionforthePrecisionofFloating-PointValues  If scientiﬁc notation is used, precision   deﬁnes the number of decimal places in the fractional part. In all cases, the remainder is not cut off but rounded. Calling precision   without arguments returns the current precision. Calling it with an argument sets the precision to that value and returns the previous precision. The default precision is six decimal places.   788  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  By default, neither ios::fixed nor ios::scientific is set. In this case, the notation used depends on the value written. All meaningful but, at most, precision   decimal places are written as follows: A leading zero before the decimal point and or all trailing zeros and potentially even the decimal point are removed. If precision   places are sufﬁcient, decimal notation is used; otherwise, scientiﬁc notation is used.  Table 15.27 shows the somewhat complicated dependencies between ﬂags and precision, using  two concrete values as an example.  As for integral values, ios::showpos can be used to write a positive sign, and ios::uppercase  can be used to dictate whether the scientiﬁc notations should use uppercase or lowercase letters.

ManipulatorsforFloating-PointValues   15.7 Formatting  For example, the statement  produces this output: 1.23456789e-01  std::cout << std::scientific << std::showpoint  << std::setprecision 8  << 0.123456789 << std::endl;  789  Note that setprecision   is a manipulator with an argument, so you must include the header ﬁle   to use it.  15.7.7 General Formatting Deﬁnitions  Two more format ﬂags complete the list of formatting ﬂags: skipws and unitbuf  Table 15.29 .  Flag skipws unitbuf  Meaning Skips leading whitespaces automatically when reading a value with operator >> Flushes the output buffer after each write operation  Table15.29. OtherFormattingFlags  By default, ios::skipws is set, which means that leading whitespaces are skipped by operator >>. Often, it is useful to have this ﬂag set. For example, with it set, reading the separating spaces between numbers explicitly is not necessary. However, this implies that reading space characters using operator >> is not possible because leading whitespaces are always skipped.  With ios::unitbuf, the buffering of the output is controlled. When it is set, output is un- buffered, which means that the output buffer is ﬂushed after each write operation. By default, this ﬂag is not set for most streams. However, for the streams cerr and wcerr, this ﬂag is set initially.  Both ﬂags can be manipulated using the manipulators presented in Table 15.30.  Manipulator Meaning skipws  noskipws  unitbuf  nounitbuf  Skips leading whitespaces with operator >>  sets the ﬂag ios::skipws  Does not skip leading whitespaces with operator >>  clears the ﬂag ios::skipws  Flushes the output buffer after each write operation  sets the ﬂag ios::unitbuf  Does not ﬂush the output buffer after each write operation  clears the ﬂag ios::unitbuf   Table15.30. ManipulatorsforOtherFormattingFlags   790  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  15.8 Internationalization  You can adapt I O formats to national conventions. To do so, the class ios_base deﬁnes the member functions presented in Table 15.31.  Member Function Meaning imbue loc  getloc    Sets the locale object Returns the current locale object  Table15.31. MemberFunctionsforInternationalization  Each stream uses an associated locale object. The initial default locale object is a copy of the global locale object at the construction time of the stream. The locale object deﬁnes, for example, details about numeric formatting, such as the character used as the decimal point or the strings used for the textual representation of Boolean values.  In contrast to the C localization facilities, you can conﬁgure each stream individually with a spe- ciﬁc locale object. This capability can be used, for example, to read ﬂoating-point values according to American format and to write them using German format  in German, a comma is used as the “decimal point” . Section 16.2.1, page 860, presents an example and discusses the details.  Several characters, mainly special characters, are often needed in the character set of the stream.  For this reason, some conversion functions are provided by streams  Table 15.32 .  Member Function Meaning widen c  narrow c,def   Converts the char character c to a character of the stream’s character set Converts character c from the stream’s character set to a char; if there is no such char, def is returned  Table15.32. StreamFunctionsfortheInternationalizationofCharacters  For example, to get the newline character from the character set of the stream strm, you can use  a statement like  strm.widen ’\n’   For additional details on locales and on internationalization in general, see Chapter 16.   15.9 File Access  15.9 File Access  791  Streams can be used to access ﬁles. This section discusses the corresponding features provided.  15.9.1 File Stream Classes  The C++ standard library provides four class templates for which the following standard specializa- tions are predeﬁned: 1. The class template basic_ifstream  with the specializations ifstream and wifstream is  for read access to ﬁles  “input ﬁle stream” .  2. The class template basic_ofstream  with the specializations ofstream and wofstream is  for write access to ﬁles  “output ﬁle stream” .  3. The class template basic_fstream  with the specializations fstream and wfstream is for  access to ﬁles that should be both read and written.  4. The class template basic_filebuf  with the specializations filebuf and wfilebuf is used  by the other ﬁle stream classes to perform the actual reading and writing of characters.  The classes are related to the stream base classes, as depicted in Figure 15.2, and are declared in the header ﬁle   as follows:  namespace std {  template <typename charT,  typename traits = char_traits  > class basic_ifstream;  typedef basic_ifstream  typedef basic_ifstream  wifstream;  ifstream;  template <typename charT,  typename traits = char_traits  > class basic_ofstream;  typedef basic_ofstream  typedef basic_ofstream  wofstream;  ofstream;  template <typename charT,  typename traits = char_traits  > class basic_fstream;  typedef basic_fstream  typedef basic_fstream  wfstream;  fstream;  template <typename charT,  typename traits = char_traits  > class basic_filebuf;  typedef basic_filebuf  typedef basic_filebuf  wfilebuf;  filebuf;  }   792  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  Figure15.2. ClassHierarchyoftheFileStreamClasses  Compared with the mechanism of C, a major advantage of the ﬁle stream classes for ﬁle access is the automatic management of ﬁles. The ﬁles are automatically opened at construction time and closed at destruction time. This is possible, of course, through appropriate deﬁnitions of correspond- ing constructors and destructors.  For streams that are both read and written, it is important to note that it is not possible to switch arbitrarily between reading and writing.12 Once you start to read or write a ﬁle you have to perform a seek operation, potentially to the current position, to switch from reading to writing or vice versa. The only exception to this rule is if you have read until end-of-ﬁle. In this case, you can continue writing characters immediately. Violating this rule can lead to all kinds of strange effects.  12 This restriction is inherited from C.

Whether this attempt was successful is reﬂected in the stream’s state. Thus, the state should be examined after construction.  The following program ﬁrst opens the ﬁle charset.out, writes the current character set — all  characters for the values between 32 and 255 — into this ﬁle, and outputs its contents:     io fstream1.cpp  include   include   include   include   include   using namespace std;     for strings    for I O    for ﬁle I O    for setw      for exit       forward declarations void writeCharsetToFile  const string& filename ; void outputFile  const string& filename ;  int main    {  }  writeCharsetToFile "charset.out" ; outputFile "charset.out" ;  void writeCharsetToFile  const string& filename  {     open output ﬁle ofstream file filename ;     ﬁle opened? if  ! file  {  << endl;  exit EXIT_FAILURE ;     NO, abort program cerr << "can’t open output file \"" << filename << "\""  }  }     write character set for  int i=32; i<256; ++i  {  file << "value: " << setw 3  << i << "  "  << "char:  "   i  << endl;  }     closes ﬁle automatically   794  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes     NO, abort program cerr << "can’t open input file \"" << filename << "\""  void outputFile  const string& filename  {     open input ﬁle ifstream file filename ;     ﬁle opened? if  ! file  {  << endl;  exit EXIT_FAILURE ;  }  }     copy ﬁle contents to cout char c; while  file.get c   {  cout.put c ;  }     closes ﬁle automatically  In writeCharsetToFile  , the constructor of the class ofstream takes care of opening the ﬁle named by the given ﬁlename:  std::ofstream file filename ;     open ﬁle for writing  Unfortunately, before C++11, the ﬁle stream classes did not provide a constructor taking a string as argument. So, before C++11, you had to write:  std::ofstream file filename.c_str   ;     open ﬁle for writing before C++11  After this declaration, it is determined whether the stream is in a good state:  if  ! file  {  ...  }  If opening the stream was not successful, this test will fail. After this check, a loop prints the values 32 to 255 together with the corresponding characters.  In the function outputFile  , the constructor of the class ifstream opens the ﬁle for reading.  Then the contents of the ﬁle are read and output characterwise.  At the end of both functions, the ﬁle opened locally is closed automatically when the correspond- ing stream goes out of scope. The destructors of the classes ifstream and ofstream take care of closing the ﬁle if it is still open at destruction time.  Instead of copying the ﬁle contents character by character, you could also output the whole contents in one statement by passing a pointer to the stream buffer of the ﬁle as an argument to operator <<:   15.9 File Access  795     copy ﬁle contents to cout std::cout << file.rdbuf  ;  See Section 15.14.3, page 846, for details.  15.9.2 Rvalue and Move Semantics for File Streams  Since C++11, ﬁle streams provide rvalue and move semantics. In fact, ostreams provide an output operator, and istreams provide an input iterator that accepts an rvalue reference for the stream. The effect is that you can now use temporarily created stream objects, and they behave as expected. For example, you can write to a temporarily created ﬁle stream:13     io fstream2.cpp  include   include   include    int main   {     write string to a temporarily created ﬁle stream  since C++11  std::string s "hello" ; std::ofstream "fstream2.tmp"  << s << std::endl;     write C-string to a temporarily created ﬁle stream    - NOTE: wrote a pointer value before C++11 std::ofstream "fstream2.tmp", std::ios::app  << "world" << std::endl;  }  Since C++11, this writes "hello" and "world" to the ﬁle "fstream2.tmp". Before C++11, in- stead of the ﬁrst output statement you had to write the following:  std::string s "hello" ; std::ofstream os "fstream2.tmp" ; os << s << std::endl;  Note that before C++11, the second output statement compiled but did something very unexpected: It wrote a pointer value to "fstream2.tmp". The reason for the old behavior was that the following member function was called  see Section 15.3.3, page 756 :  ostream& ostream::operator<<  const void* ptr ;  In addition, ﬁle streams now have move and swap semantics providing a move constructor, a move assignment operator, and swap  . So you can pass a ﬁle stream as argument or return a ﬁle stream from a function. For example, if a ﬁle should be used longer than the scope in which it was created,  13 Thanks to Daniel Krugler for providing this example.  ¨   796  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  you can return it as follows since C++11  see Section 3.1.5, page 22, for details about returning values with move semantics :  std::ofstream openFile  const std::string& filename  {  std::ofstream file filename ; ... return file;  }  std::ofstream file; file = openFile "xyz.tmp" ; file << "hello, world" << std::endl;     use returned ﬁle stream  since C++11   Before C++11, you had to — and as an alternative you still can — allocate the ﬁle object on the heap and delete it later when it is no longer needed:  std::ofstream* filePtr = new std::ofstream "xyz.tmp" ; ... delete filePtr;  For such a case, some smart pointer classes  see Section 5.2, page 76  should be used.  15.9.3 File Flags  A set of ﬂags is deﬁned in the class ios_base for precise control over the processing mode of a ﬁle  Table 15.33 . These ﬂags are of type openmode, which is a bitmask type similar to fmtflags.  Flag in out app ate trunc binary Does not replace special characters  Meaning Opens for reading  default for ifstream  Opens for writing  default for ofstream  Always appends at the end when writing Positions at the end of the ﬁle after opening  “at end”  Removes the former ﬁle contents  Table15.33. FlagsforOpeningFiles  The ﬂag binary conﬁgures the stream to suppress conversion of special characters or character sequences, such as end-of-line or end-of-ﬁle. In operating systems, such as Windows or OS 2, a line end in text ﬁles is represented by two characters  CR and LF . In normal text mode  binary is not set , newline characters are replaced by the two-character sequence, and vice versa, when reading or writing to avoid special processing. In binary mode  binary is set , none of these conversions take place.  The ﬂag binary should always be used if the contents of a ﬁle do not consist of a character sequence but are processed as binary data. An example is the copying of ﬁles by reading the ﬁle to   15.9 File Access  797  be copied character by character and writing those characters without modifying them. If the ﬁle is processed as text, the ﬂag should not be set, because special handling of newlines would be required. For example, a newline would still consist of two characters.  Some implementations provide additional ﬂags, such as nocreate  the ﬁle must exist when it is opened  and noreplace  the ﬁle must not exist . However, these ﬂags are not standard and thus are not portable.  The ﬂags can be combined by using operator . The resulting openmode can be passed as an optional second argument to the constructor. For example, the following statement opens a ﬁle for appending text at the end:  std::ofstream file "xyz.out", std::ios::outstd::ios::app ;  Table 15.34 correlates the various combinations of ﬂags with the strings used in the interface of C’s function for opening ﬁles: fopen  . The combinations with the binary and the ate ﬂags set are not listed. A set binary corresponds to strings with b appended, and a set ate corresponds to a seek to the end of the ﬁle immediately after opening. Other combinations not listed in the table, such as truncapp, are not allowed. Note that before C++11, app, inapp, and inoutapp were not speciﬁed.  ios_base Flags Meaning in out outtrunc outapp app inout inouttrunc inapp inoutapp  Reads  ﬁle must exist  Empties and writes  creates if necessary  Empties and writes  creates if necessary  Appends  creates if necessary  Appends  creates if necessary  Reads and writes; initial position is the start  ﬁle must exist  Empties, reads, and writes  creates if necessary  Updates at end  creates if necessary  Updates at end  creates if necessary   C Mode "r" "w" "w" "a" "a" "r+" "w+" "a+" "a+"  Table15.34. MeaningofOpenModesinC++  Whether a ﬁle is opened for reading and or for writing is independent of the corresponding stream object’s class. The class determines only the default open mode if no second argument is used. This means that ﬁles used only by the class ifstream or the class ofstream can be opened for reading and writing. The open mode is passed to the corresponding stream buffer class, which opens the ﬁle. However, the operations possible for the object are determined by the stream’s class.  The ﬁle owned by a ﬁle stream can also be opened or closed explicitly. For this, three member functions are deﬁned  Table 15.35 . These functions are useful mainly if a ﬁle stream is created without being initialized.  To demonstrate their use, the following example opens all ﬁles with names that are given as  arguments to the program and writes their contents  this corresponds to the UNIX program cat .   798  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  Member Function Meaning Opens a ﬁle for the stream, using the default mode open name  open name,ﬂags  Opens a ﬁle for the stream, using ﬂags as the mode close   is_open    Closes the streams ﬁle Returns whether the ﬁle is opened  Table15.35. MemberFunctionstoOpenandCloseFiles     io cat1.cpp     header ﬁles for ﬁle I O include   include   using namespace std;     for all ﬁlenames passed as command-line arguments    - open, print contents, and close ﬁle int main  int argc, char* argv[]  {  ifstream file;     for all command-line arguments for  int i=1; i<argc; ++i  {     open ﬁle file.open argv[i] ;     write ﬁle contents to cout char c; while  file.get c   {  cout.put c ;  }     clear eofbit and failbit set due to end-of-ﬁle file.clear  ;     close ﬁle file.close  ;  }  }  Note that after the processing of a ﬁle, clear   must be called to clear the state ﬂags that are set at end-of-ﬁle. This is required because the stream object is used for multiple ﬁles. Note that open     15.9 File Access  799  never clears any state ﬂags. Thus, if a stream was not in a good state after closing and reopening it, you still have to call clear   to get to a good state. This is also the case if you open a different ﬁle. Instead of processing character by character, you could also print the entire contents of the ﬁle in  one statement by passing a pointer to the stream buffer of the ﬁle as an argument to operator <<:     write ﬁle contents to cout std::cout << file.rdbuf  ;  See Section 15.14.3, page 846, for details.  15.9.4 Random Access  Class basic_istream   basic_ostream   Member Function Meaning tellg   seekg pos  seekg offset,rpos  tellp   seekp pos  seekp offset,rpos   Returns the read position Sets the read position as an absolute value Sets the read position as a relative value Returns the write position Sets the write position as an absolute value Sets the write position as a relative value  Table15.36. MemberFunctionsforStreamPositions  Table 15.36 lists the member functions deﬁned for positioning within C++ streams. These func- tions distinguish between read and write position  g stands for get and p stands for put . Read- position functions are deﬁned in basic_istream , and write-position functions are deﬁned in basic_ostream . However, not all stream classes support positioning. For example, positioning the streams cin, cout, and cerr is not deﬁned. The positioning of ﬁles is deﬁned in the base classes because, usually, references to objects of type istream and ostream are passed around.  The functions seekg   and seekp   can be called with absolute or relative positions. To handle absolute positions, you must use tellg   and tellp  , which return an absolute position as a value of type pos_type. This value is not an integral value or simply the position of the character as an index, because the logical position and the real position can differ. For example, in Windows text ﬁles, newline characters are represented by two characters in the ﬁle, even though it is logically only one character. Things are even worse if the ﬁle uses some multibyte representation for the characters. The exact deﬁnition of pos_type is a bit complicated: The C++ standard library deﬁnes a global class template fpos  for ﬁle positions. Class fpos  is used to deﬁne types streampos for char and wstreampos for wchar_t streams. These types are used to deﬁne the pos_type of the corresponding character traits  see Section 16.1.4, page 855 , and this pos_type member of the traits is used to deﬁne pos_type of the corresponding stream classes. Thus, you could also use streampos as the type for the stream positions. However, using long or unsigned long is wrong because streampos is not an integral type  anymore .14 For example:  14 Formerly, streampos was used for stream positions, and it was simply deﬁned as unsigned long.   800  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes     save current ﬁle position std::ios::pos_type pos = file.tellg  ; ...    seek to ﬁle position saved in pos file.seekg pos ;  Instead of  std::ios::pos_type pos;  you could also write:  std::streampos pos;  For relative values, the offset can be relative to three positions, for which corresponding constants are deﬁned  Table 15.37 . The constants are deﬁned in class ios_base and are of type seekdir.  Constant Meaning beg cur end  Position is relative to the beginning  “beginning”  Position is relative to the current position  “current”  Position is relative to the end  “end”   Table15.37. ConstantsforRelativePositions  The type for the offset is off_type, which is an indirect deﬁnition of streamoff. Similar to pos_type, streamoff is used to deﬁne off_type of the traits  see Section 16.1.4, page 855  and the stream classes. However, streamoff is a signed integral type, so you can use integral values as stream offsets. For example:     seek to the beginning of the ﬁle file.seekg  0, std::ios::beg ; ...    seek 20 characters forward file.seekg  20, std::ios::cur ; ...    seek 10 characters before the end file.seekg  -10, std::ios::end ;  contents of a ﬁle twice:     io cat2.cpp     header ﬁles for ﬁle I O include   include    In all cases, care must be taken to position only within a ﬁle. beginning of a ﬁle or beyond the end, the behavior is undeﬁned. The following example demonstrates the use of seekg  .  If a position ends up before the  It uses a function that writes the   15.9 File Access  801  void printFileTwice  const char* filename  {     open ﬁle std::ifstream file filename ;     print contents the ﬁrst time std::cout << file.rdbuf  ;     seek to the beginning file.seekg 0 ;     print contents the second time std::cout << file.rdbuf  ;  }  }  }  int main  int argc, char* argv[]  {     print all ﬁles passed as a command-line argument twice for  int i=1; i<argc; ++i  { printFileTwice argv[i] ;  Note that file.rdbuf   is used to print the contents of file  see Section 15.14.3, page 846 . Thus, you operate directly on the stream buffer, which can’t manipulate the state of the stream. If you print the contents of file by using the stream interface functions, such as getline    see Section 15.5.1, page 768 , you’d have to clear   the state of file before it could be manipulated in any way  including changes of the read position , because these functions set ios::eofbit and ios::failbit when end-of-ﬁle is reached.  Different functions are provided for the manipulation of the read and the write positions. How- ever, for the standard streams, the same position is maintained for reading and writing in the same stream buffer. This is important if multiple streams use the same stream buffer  see Section 15.12.2, page 820, for details .  15.9.5 Using File Descriptors  Some implementations provide the possibility of attaching a stream to an already opened I O chan- nel. To do this, you initialize the ﬁle stream with a ﬁle descriptor.  File descriptors are integers that identify an open I O channel. In UNIX-like systems, ﬁle descrip- tors are used in the low-level interface to the I O functions of the operating system. The following ﬁle descriptors are predeﬁned:   802  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes    0 for the standard input channel   1 for the standard output channel   2 for the standard error channel These channels may be connected to ﬁles, the console, other processes, or some other I O facility.  Unfortunately, the C++ standard library does not provide the possibility of attaching a stream to an I O channel using ﬁle descriptors. The reason is that the language is supposed to be independent of any operating system. In practice, though, the possibility probably still exists. The only drawback is that using it is not portable to all systems. What is missing at this point is a corresponding speciﬁcation in a standard of operating system interfaces, such as POSIX or X OPEN. However, such a standard is not yet planned, but at least posix is a reserved namespace since C++11.  Nevertheless, it is possible to initialize a stream by a ﬁle descriptor. See Section 15.13.3,  page 835, for a description and implementation of a possible solution.  15.10 Stream Classes for Strings  The mechanisms of stream classes can also be used to read from strings or to write to strings. String streams provide a buffer but don’t have an I O channel. This buffer string can be manipulated with special functions. A major use of this capability is the processing of I O independent of the actual I O. For example, text for output can be formatted in a string and then sent to an output channel sometime later. Another use is reading input line by line and processing each line by using string streams.  Before the standardization of C++98, the string stream classes used type char* to represent a string. Now, type string  or, in general, basic_string   is used. The old string stream classes are also part of the C++ standard library, but they are deprecated. Thus, they should not be used in new code and should be replaced in legacy code. Still, a brief description of these classes is found at the end of this section.  15.10.1 String Stream Classes  wistringstream for reading from strings  “input string stream”   The following stream classes — corresponding to the stream classes for ﬁles — are deﬁned for strings:   The class template basic_istringstream  with the specializations istringstream and   The class template basic_ostringstream  with the specializations ostringstream and   The class template basic_stringstream  with the specializations stringstream and   The class template basic_stringbuf  with the specializations stringbuf and wstringbuf,  wostringstream for writing to strings  “output string stream”   wstringstream for reading from and writing to strings  used by the other string stream classes to perform the reading and writing of characters  These classes have a similar relationship to the stream base classes, as do the ﬁle stream classes. The class hierarchy is depicted in Figure 15.3.   15.10 Stream Classes for Strings  803  Figure15.3.

Member Function Meaning str   str string   Returns the buffer as a string Sets the contents of the buffer to string  Table15.38. FundamentalOperationsforStringStreams  The following program demonstrates the use of string streams:     io sstream1.cpp  include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {  ostringstream os;     decimal and hexadecimal value os << "dec: " << 15 << hex << " hex: " << 15 << endl; cout << os.str   << endl;     append ﬂoating value and bitset bitset  b 5789 ; os << "float: " << 4.67 << " bitset: " << b << endl;   15.10 Stream Classes for Strings  805     overwrite with octal value os.seekp 0 ; os << "oct: " << oct << 15; cout << os.str   << endl;  }  The output of this program is as follows:  dec: 15 hex: f  oct: 17 hex: f float: 4.67 bitset: 001011010011101  First, a decimal and a hexadecimal value are written to os. Next, a ﬂoating-point value and a bitset  written in binary  are appended. Using seekp  , the write position is moved to the beginning of the stream. So, the following call of operator << writes at the beginning of the string, thus overwriting the beginning of the existing string stream. However, the characters that are not overwritten remain valid. To remove the current contents from the stream, you can use the function str   to assign new contents to the buffer: strm.str "" ;  The ﬁrst lines written to os are each terminated with endl. This means that the string ends with a newline character. Because the string is printed followed by endl, two adjacent newline characters are written. This explains the empty lines in the output.  Before C++11, a typical programming error when dealing with string streams was to forget to extract the string with the function str   and to write to the stream directly instead. This was, from a compiler’s point of view, a possible and reasonable thing to do because there was an implicit conversion to void*  see Section 15.4.3, page 760 . As a result, instead of its value the state of the stream was written in the form of an address  see Section 15.3.3, page 756 . With C++11, this conversion was replaced by an explicit conversion to bool, so passing a string stream to the output operator << without calling str   is no longer possible.  A typical use for writing to an output string stream is to deﬁne output operators for user-deﬁned  types  see Section 15.11.1, page 810 .  Input string streams are used mainly for formatted reading from existing strings. For example, it is often easier to read data line by line and then analyze each line individually. The following lines read the integer x with the value 3 and the ﬂoating-point f with the value 0.7 from the string s:  int x; float f; std::string s = "3.7";  std::istringstream is s ; is >> x >> f;   806  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  A string stream can be created with the ﬂags for the ﬁle open modes  see Section 15.9.3, page 796  and or an existing string. With the ﬂag ios::ate, the characters written to a string stream can be appended to an existing string:15  std::string s "value: " ; ... std::ostringstream os  s, std::ios::outstd::ios::ate ; os << 77 << " " << std::hex << 77 << std::endl; std::cout << os.str  ; std::cout << s;     writes: value: 77 4d    writes: value:  As you can see, the string returned from str   is a copy of the string s, with a decimal and a hexadecimal version of 77 appended. The string s itself is not modiﬁed.  15.10.2 Move Semantics for String Streams  Since C++11, string streams provide rvalue and move semantics. In fact, ostreams provide an output operator, and istreams provide an input iterator that accepts an rvalue reference for the stream. The effect is that you can use temporarily created stream objects. For example, you can insert into a temporarily created string stream:16     io sstream2.cpp  include   include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  } else {  }  }  tuple  parseName string name  {  string s1, s2, s3; istringstream name  >> s1 >> s2 >> s3; if  s3.empty    {  return tuple  move s1 ,"",move s2  ;  return tuple  move s1 ,move s2 ,move s3  ;  15 Whether the ﬂag ios::app has the same effect is currently not clear; so using it here instead is not portable. 16 Thanks to Daniel Krugler for providing this example.  ¨   15.10 Stream Classes for Strings  807  int main   {  auto t1 = parseName "Nicolai M. Josuttis" ; cout   t1  << endl; "   t1  << endl; cout << "middle: cout << "lastname: "   t1  << endl; auto t2 = parseName "Nico Josuttis" ; cout   t2  << endl; "   t2  << endl; cout << "middle: cout << "lastname: "   t2  << endl;  }  Before C++11, you had to implement  istringstream is name ; is >> s1 >> s2 >> s3;  instead of  istringstream name  >> s1 >> s2 >> s3;  In addition, string streams now have move and swap semantics, providing a move constructor, a move assignment operator, and swap  . So, you can pass a string stream as an argument or return a string stream from a function.  15.10.3 char* Stream Classes  The char* stream classes are retained only for backward compatibility. Their interface is error prone, and the classes are rarely used correctly. However, they are still in use and thus are described brieﬂy here. Note that the standard version described here has slightly modiﬁed the old interface.  The char* stream classes are deﬁned only for the character type char. They include  In this subsection, the term character sequence will be used instead of string because the charac- ter sequence maintained by the char* stream classes is not always terminated with the  terminating  null character and thus is not really a string.   The class istrstream for reading from character sequences  input string stream    The class ostrstream for writing to character sequences  output string stream    The class strstream for reading from and writing to character sequences   The class strstreambuf used as a stream buffer for char* streams The char* stream classes are deﬁned in the header ﬁle  .  An istrstream can be initialized with a character sequence  of type char*  that is either ter- minated with the  terminating  null character 0 or for which the number of characters is passed as the argument. A typical use is the reading and processing of whole lines:   808  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  char buffer[1000];     buffer for at most 999 characters     read line std::cin.get buffer,sizeof buffer  ;     read process line as stream std::istrstream input buffer ; ... input >> x;  A char* stream for writing can either maintain a character sequence that grows as needed or be initialized with a buffer of ﬁxed size. Using the ﬂag ios::app or ios:ate, you can append the characters written to a character sequence that is already stored in the buffer.  Care must be taken when using char* stream as a string. In contrast to string streams, char*  streams are not always responsible for the memory used to store the character sequence.  With the member function str  , the character sequence is made available to the caller together with the responsibility for the corresponding memory. Unless the stream is initialized with a buffer of ﬁxed size — for which the stream is never responsible — the following three rules have to be obeyed: 1. Because ownership of the memory is transferred to the caller, the character sequence has to be released unless the stream was initialized with a buffer of ﬁxed size. However, there is no guar- antee how the memory was allocated,17 so it is not always safe to release it by using delete[ ]. Your best bet is to return the memory to the stream by calling the member function freeze   with the argument false  the following paragraphs present an example .  2. With the call to str  , the stream is no longer allowed to modify the character sequence. It calls the member function freeze   implicitly, which freezes the character sequence. The reason for this is to avoid complications if the allocated buffer is not sufﬁciently large and new memory has to be allocated.  3. The member function str   does not append a  terminating  null character  ’\0’ . This char- acter has to be appended explicitly to the stream to terminate the character sequence. This can be done by using the ends manipulator. Some implementations append a string  terminating  null character automatically, but this behavior is not portable.  The following example demonstrates the use of a char* stream:  float x; ...    create and ﬁll char* stream    - don’t forget ends or ’\0’ !!! std::ostrstream buffer; buffer << "float x: " << x << std::ends;     dynamic stream buffer  17 There is a constructor that takes two function pointers as an argument: a function to allocate memory and a function to release memory.   15.10 Stream Classes for Strings  809     pass resulting C-string to foo   and return memory to buffer char* s = buffer.str  ; foo s ; buffer.freeze false ;  A frozen char* stream can be restored to its normal state for additional manipulation. To do so, the member function freeze   has to be called with the argument false. With this operation, ownership of the character sequence is returned to the stream object. This is the only safe way to release the memory for the character sequence. The next example demonstrates this:  float x; ... std::ostrstream buffer;     dynamic char* stream     ﬁll char* stream buffer << "float x: " << x << std::ends;     pass resulting C-string to foo      - freezes the char* stream foo buffer.str   ;     unfreeze the char* stream buffer.freeze false ;     seek writing position to the beginning buffer.seekp  0, ios::beg ;     pass resulting C-string to foo   again    - freezes the char* stream foo buffer.str   ;     return memory to buffer buffer.freeze false ;     reﬁll char* stream buffer << "once more float x: " << x << std::ends;  The problems related to freezing the stream are removed from the string stream classes, mainly because the strings are copied and because the string class takes care of the used memory.   810  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  15.11 Input Output Operators for  User-Deﬁned Types  As mentioned earlier in this chapter, a major advantage of streams over the old I O mechanism of C is the possibility that the stream mechanism can be extended to user-deﬁned types. To do this, you must overload operators  >. This is demonstrated using a class for fractions in the following subsection.  15.11.1 Implementing Output Operators  In an expression with the output operator, the left operand is a stream and the right operand is the object to be written:  stream << object  According to language rules, this can be interpreted in two ways: 1. As stream.operator<< object  2. As operator<< stream,object  The ﬁrst way is used for built-in types. For user-deﬁned types, you have to use the second way because the stream classes are closed for extensions. All you have to do is implement global operator << for your user-deﬁned type. This is rather easy unless access to private members of the objects is necessary  which I cover later .  For example, to print an object of class Fraction with the format numerator denominator, you  can write the following function:     io frac1out.hpp  include    inline std::ostream& operator <<  std::ostream& strm, const Fraction& f  {  strm << f.numerator   << ’ ’ << f.denominator  ; return strm;  }  The function writes the numerator and the denominator, separated by the character ’ ’, to the stream that is passed as the argument. The stream can be a ﬁle stream, a string stream, or some other stream. To support the chaining of write operations or the access to the stream’s state in the same statement, the stream is returned by the function.  This simple form has two drawbacks:  1. Because ostream is used in the signature, the function applies only to streams with the character type char. If the function is intended only for use in Western Europe or in North America, this   15.11 Input Output Operators for User-Deﬁned Types  811  is no problem. On the other hand, a more general version requires only a little extra work, so it should at least be considered.  2. Another problem arises if a ﬁeld width is set. In this case, the result is probably not what might be expected. The ﬁeld width applies to the immediately following write; in this case, to the numerator. Thus, the statements Fraction vat 19,100 ; std::cout << "VAT: \"" << std::left << std::setw 8      I’m German and we have a uniform VAT of 19%  << vat << ’"’ << std::endl;  result in this output:  VAT: "19   100"  The next version solves both of these problems:     io frac2out.hpp  include   include    template   inline std::basic_ostream & operator  & strm,  const Fraction& f      string stream    - with same format    - without special ﬁeld width std::basic_ostringstream  s; s.copyfmt strm ; s.width 0 ;     ﬁll string stream s << f.numerator   << ’ ’ << f.denominator  ;     print string stream strm << s.str  ;  return strm;  {  }  The operator has become a function template that is parametrized to suit all kinds of streams. The problem with the ﬁeld width is addressed by writing the fraction ﬁrst to a string stream without setting any speciﬁc width. The constructed string is then sent to the stream passed as the argument. This results in the characters representing the fraction being written with only one write operation, to which the ﬁeld width is applied.   812  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  As a result, the statements  Fraction vat 19,100 ; std::cout << "VAT: \"" << std::left << std::setw 8      I’m German ...  << vat << ’"’ << std::endl;  now produce the following output:  VAT: "19 100  "  Note that a user-deﬁned overload of operator << for types of namespace std will have limitations. The reason is that it is not found in situations using ADL  argument-dependent lookup, also known as Koenig lookup . This, for example, is the case when ostream iterators are used. For example:  template   std::ostream& operator  & p  {  return strm << "[" << p.first << "," << p.second << "]";  }  std::pair  p 42,77777 ; std::cout << p << std::endl;     OK  std::vector > v; ... std::copy v.begin  ,v.end  ,     ERROR: doesn’t compile:  std::ostream_iterator > std::cout,"\n"  ;  15.11.2 Implementing Input Operators  Input operators are implemented according to the same principle as output operators. However, input incurs the likely problem of read failures. Input functions normally need special handling of cases in which reading might fail.  When implementing a read function, you can choose between simple or ﬂexible approaches. For example, the following function uses a simple approach, which reads a fraction without checking for error situations:     io frac1in.hpp  include    inline std::istream& operator >>  std::istream& strm, Fraction& f  {  int n, d;  strm >> n;     read value of the numerator   15.11 Input Output Operators for User-Deﬁned Types  813  strm.ignore  ; strm >> d;     skip ’ ’    read value of the denominator  f = Fraction n,d ;     assign the whole fraction  return strm;  }  The problem with this implementation is has that it can be used only for streams with the character type char. In addition, whether the character between the two numbers is indeed the character ’ ’ is not checked.  Another problem arises when undeﬁned values are read. When reading a zero for the denomina- tor, the value of the read fraction is not well deﬁned. This problem is detected in the constructor of the class Fraction that is invoked by the expression Fraction n,d . However, handling inside class Fraction means that a format error automatically results in an error handling of the class Fraction. Because it is common practice to record format errors in the stream, it might be better to set ios_base::failbit in this case.  Finally, the fraction passed by reference might be modiﬁed even if the read operation is not successful. This can happen, for example, when the read of the numerator succeeds, but the read of the denominator fails. This behavior contradicts common conventions established by the predeﬁned input operators and thus is best avoided. A read operation should be successful or have no effect.  The following implementation is improved to avoid these problems.  It is also more ﬂexible  because it is parametrized to be applicable to all stream types:     io frac2in.hpp  include    template   inline std::basic_istream & operator >>  std::basic_istream & strm, Fraction& f  {  int n, d;     read value of numerator strm >> n;     if available    - read ’ ’ and value of demonimator if  strm.peek   == ’ ’  {  strm.ignore  ; strm >> d;  }   814  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes     if denominator is zero    - set failbit as I O format error if  d == 0  {  strm.setstate std::ios::failbit ; return strm;  else {  d = 1;  }  }  }     if everything is ﬁne so far    - change the value of the fraction if  strm  {  f = Fraction n,d ;  return strm;  }  Here, the denominator is read only if the ﬁrst number is followed by the character ’ ’; otherwise, a denominator of 1 is assumed, and the integer read is interpreted as the whole fraction. Hence, the denominator is optional.  This implementation also tests whether a denominator with value 0 was read. In this case, the ios_base::failbit is set, which might trigger a corresponding exception  see Section 15.4.4, page 762 . Of course, the behavior can be implemented differently if the denominator is zero. For example, an exception could be thrown directly, or the check could be skipped so that the fraction is initialized with zero, which would throw the appropriate exception by class Fraction.  Finally, the state of the stream is checked, and the new value is assigned to the fraction only if no input error occurred. This ﬁnal check should always be done to make sure that the value of an object is changed only if the read was successful.  Of course, it can be argued whether it is reasonable to read integers as fractions. In addition, there are other subtleties that may be improved. For example, the numerator must be followed by the character ’ ’ without separating whitespaces. But the denominator may be preceded by arbitrary whitespaces because normally, these are skipped. This hints at the complexity involved in reading nontrivial data structures.  15.11.3 Input Output Using Auxiliary Functions  If the implementation of an I O operator requires access to the private data of an object, the stan- dard operators should delegate the work to auxiliary member functions. This technique also allows polymorphic read and write functions, which might look as follows:   15.11 Input Output Operators for User-Deﬁned Types  815  };  }  }  }  class Fraction {  ... public:  virtual void printOn  std::ostream& strm  const; virtual void scanFrom  std::istream& strm ; ...     output    input  std::ostream& operator <<  std::ostream& strm, const Fraction& f  {  f.printOn  strm ; return strm;  f.scanFrom  strm ; return strm;  std::istream& operator >>  std::istream& strm, Fraction& f  {  A typical example is the direct access to the numerator and denominator of a fraction during input:  void Fraction::scanFrom  std::istream& strm  {  ...    assign values directly to the components num = n; denom = d;  If a class is not intended to be used as a base class, the I O operators can be made friends of the class. However, note that this approach reduces the possibilities signiﬁcantly when inheritance is used. Friend functions cannot be virtual; as a result, the wrong function might be called. For example, if a reference to a base class refers to an object of a derived class and is used as an argument for the input operator, the operator for the base class is called. To avoid this problem, derived classes should not implement their own I O operators. Thus, the implementation sketched previously is more general than the use of friend functions and should be used as a standard approach, although most examples use friend functions instead.  15.11.4 User-Deﬁned Format Flags  When user-deﬁned I O operators are being written, it is often desirable to have formatting ﬂags speciﬁc to these operators, probably set by using a corresponding manipulator. For example, it would be nice if the output operator for fractions, shown previously, could be conﬁgured to place spaces around the slash that separates numerator and denominator.   816  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  The stream objects support this by providing a mechanism to associate data with a stream. This mechanism can be used to associate corresponding data — for example, using a manipulator — and later retrieve the data. The class ios_base deﬁnes the two functions iword   and pword  , each taking an int argument as the index, to access a speciﬁc long& or void*&, respectively. The idea is that iword   and pword   access long or void* objects in an array of arbitrary size stored with a stream object. Formatting ﬂags to be stored for a stream are then placed at the same index for all streams. The static member function xalloc   of the class ios_base is used to obtain an index that is not yet used for this purpose.  Initially, the objects accessed with iword   or pword   are set to 0. This value can be used to represent the default formatting or to indicate that the corresponding data was not yet accessed. Here is an example:     get index for new ostream data static const int iword_index = std::ios_base::xalloc  ;     deﬁne manipulator that sets this data std::ostream& fraction_spaces  std::ostream& strm  {  strm.iword iword_index  = true; return strm;  }  }  std::ostream& operator<<  std::ostream& strm, const Fraction& f  {     query the ostream data    - if true, use spaces between numerator and denominator    - if false, use no spaces between numerator and denominator if  strm.iword iword_index   {  strm << f.numerator   << "   " << f.denominator  ;  strm << f.numerator   << " " << f.denominator  ;  } else {  } return strm;  This example uses a simple approach to the implementation of the output operator because the main feature to be exposed is the use of the function iword  . The format ﬂag is considered to be a Boolean value that deﬁnes whether spaces between numerator and denominator should be written. In the ﬁrst line, the function ios_base::xalloc   obtains an index that can be used to store the format ﬂag. The result of this call is stored in a constant because it is never modiﬁed. The function fraction_spaces   is a manipulator that sets the int value that is stored at the index iword_index in the integer array associated with the stream strm to true. The output operator retrieves that value and writes the fraction according the value stored. If the value is false, the default formatting using no spaces is used. Otherwise, spaces are placed around the slash.   15.11 Input Output Operators for User-Deﬁned Types  817  When iword   and pword   are used, references to long or void* objects are returned. These references stay valid only until the next call of iword   or pword   for the corresponding stream object, or until the stream object is destroyed. Normally, the results from iword   and pword   should not be saved.18 It is assumed that the access is fast, although it is not required that the data be represented by using an array.  The function copyfmt   copies all format information  see Section 15.7.1, page 779 , including the arrays accessed with iword   and pword  . This may pose a problem for the objects stored with a stream using pword  . For example, if a value is the address of an object, the address is copied instead of the object. If you copy only the address, it may happen that if the format of one stream is changed, the format of other streams would be affected. In addition, it may be desirable that an object associated with a stream using pword   be destroyed when the stream is destroyed. So, a deep copy rather than a shallow copy may be necessary for such an object.  A callback mechanism is deﬁned by ios_base to support such behavior as making a deep copy if necessary or deleting an object when destroying a stream. The function register_callback   can be used to register a function that is called if certain operations are performed on the ios_base object. It is declared as follows:  namespace std {  class ios_base {  public:     kinds of callback events enum event { erase_event, imbue_event, copyfmt_event };    type of callbacks typedef void  *event_callback   event e, ios_base& strm,     function to register callbacks void register_callback  event_callback cb, int arg ; ...  int arg ;  };  }  The function register_callback   takes a function pointer as the ﬁrst argument and an int argument as the second. The int argument is passed as the third argument when a registered function is called and can, for example, be used to identify an index for pword   to signal which member of the array has to be processed. The argument strm that is passed to the callback function is the ios_base object that caused the call to the callback function. The argument e identiﬁes the reason why the callback function was called. The reasons for calling the callback functions are listed in Table 15.39.  18 In general, returned pointers and references should not be saved when it is not clear that the lifetime of the object they refer to is long enough.   818  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  Event ios_base::imbue_event A locale is set with imbue   ios_base::erase_event ios_base::copy_event  The stream is destroyed or copyfmt   is used copyfmt   is used  Reason  Table15.39. ReasonsforCallbackEvents  If copyfmt   is used, the callbacks are called twice for the object on which copyfmt   is called. First, before anything is copied, the callbacks are invoked with the argument erase_event to do all the cleanup necessary, such as deleting objects stored in the pword   array. The callbacks called are those registered for the object. After the format ﬂags are copied, which includes the list of callbacks from the argument stream, the callbacks are called again, this time with the argument copy_event. This pass can, for example, be used to arrange for deep copying of objects stored in the pword   array. Note that the callbacks are also copied and the original list of callbacks is removed. Thus, the callbacks invoked for the second pass are the callbacks just copied.  The callback mechanism is very primitive. It does not allow callback functions to be unregistered except by using copyfmt   with an argument that has no callbacks registered. Also, registering a callback function twice, even with the same argument, results in calling the callback function twice. It is, however, guaranteed that the callbacks are called in the opposite order of registration. Thus, a callback function registered from within another callback function is not called before the next time the callback functions are invoked.  15.11.5 Conventions for User-Deﬁned Input Output Operators  This applies especially to the width for writing.  Several conventions that should be followed by the implementations of your own I O operators have been presented. These conventions correspond to behavior that is typical for the predeﬁned I O operators. To summarize, these conventions are as follows:   The output format should allow an input operator that can read the data without loss of informa- tion. Especially for strings, this is close to impossible because a problem with spaces arises. A space character in the string cannot be distinguished from a space character between two strings.   The current formatting speciﬁcation of the stream should be taken into account when doing I O.   If an error occurs, an appropriate state ﬂag should be set.   The objects should not be modiﬁed in case of an error. If multiple data is read, the data should ﬁrst be stored in auxiliary objects before the value of the object passed to the read operator is set.   Output should not be terminated with a newline character, mainly because it is otherwise impos-   Even values that are too large should be read completely. After the read, a corresponding error ﬂag should be set, and the value returned should be some meaningful value, such as the maximum value.  sible to write other objects on the same line.    If a format error is detected, no character should be read, if possible.   15.12 Connecting Input and Output Streams  819  15.12 Connecting Input and Output Streams  Often, you need to connect two streams. For example, you may want to ensure that text asking for input is written on the screen before the input is read. Another example is reading from and writing to the same stream. This is of interest mainly regarding ﬁles. A third example is the need to manipulate the same stream using different formats. This section discusses all these techniques.  15.12.1 Loose Coupling Using tie    You can tie a stream to an output stream. This means that the buffers of both streams are synchro- nized in a way that the buffer of the output stream is ﬂushed before each input or output of the other stream. That is, for the output stream, the function flush   is called. Table 15.40 lists the member functions deﬁned in basic_ios to tie one stream to another.  Member Function tie   tie ostream* strm   Meaning Returns a pointer to the output stream that is tied to the stream Ties the output stream to which the argument refers to the stream and returns a pointer to the previous output stream that was tied to the stream, if any  Table15.40. TieingOneStreamtoAnother  Calling the function tie   without any argument returns a pointer to the output stream that is currently tied to a stream. To tie a new output stream to a stream, a pointer to that output stream must be passed as the argument to tie  . The argument is deﬁned to be a pointer because you can also pass nullptr  or 0 or NULL  as an argument. This argument means “no tie” and unties any tied output stream. If no output stream is tied, tie   returns nullptr or 0. For each stream, you can have only one output stream that is tied to this stream. However, you can tie an output stream to different streams.  By default, the standard input is connected to the standard output by using this mechanism:    predeﬁned connections: std::cin.tie  &std::cout ; std::wcin.tie  &std::wcout ;  This ensures that a message asking for input is ﬂushed before requesting the input. For example, during the statements  the function flush   is called implicitly for cout before reading x.  To remove the connection between two streams, you pass nullptr  or 0 or NULL  to tie  . For  std::cout << "Please enter x: "; std::cin >> x;  example:     decouple cin from any output stream std::cin.tie  nullptr ;   820  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  This might improve the performance of a program by avoiding unnecessary additional ﬂushing of streams  see Section 15.14.2, page 846, for a discussion of stream performance .  You can also tie one output stream to another output stream. For example, with the following  statement, the normal output is ﬂushed before something is written to the error stream:     tieing cout to cerr std::cerr.tie  &std::cout ;  15.12.2 Tight Coupling Using Stream Buffers  Using the function rdbuf  , you can couple streams tightly by using a common stream buffer  Table 15.41 . These functions suit several purposes, which are discussed in this and the following subsections.  Member Function Meaning rdbuf   rdbuf streambuf*   Returns a pointer to the stream buffer Installs the stream buffer pointed to by the argument and returns a pointer to the previously used stream buffer  Table15.41. StreamBufferAccess  The member function rdbuf   allows several stream objects to read from the same input chan- nel or to write to the same output channel without garbling the order of the I O. The use of multiple stream buffers does not work smoothly, because the I O operations are buffered. Thus, when using different streams with different buffers for the same I O channel, I O may pass other I O. An addi- tional constructor of basic_istream and basic_ostream is used to initialize the stream with a stream buffer passed as the argument. For example:     io streambuffer1.cpp  include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {     stream for hexadecimal standard output ostream hexout cout.rdbuf   ; hexout.setf  ios::hex, ios::basefield ; hexout.setf  ios::showbase ;     switch between decimal and hexadecimal output hexout << "hexout: " << 177 << " "; cout << 177 << " "; hexout << "hexout: " << -49 << " ";  << "cout: "   15.12 Connecting Input and Output Streams  821  << "cout: "  cout hexout << endl;  << -49 << " ";  Note that the destructor of the classes basic_istream and basic_ostream does not delete the corresponding stream buffer  it was not opened by these classes, anyway . Thus, you can pass a stream device by using a pointer instead of a stream reference to the stream buffer:     io streambuffer2.cpp  include   include    void hexMultiplicationTable  std::streambuf* buffer, int num  {  std::ostream hexout buffer ; hexout << std::hex << std::showbase;  }  }  for  int i=1; i<=num; ++i  {  for  int j=1; j<=10; ++j  {  hexout << i*j << ’ ’;  } hexout << std::endl;  }  }     does NOT close buffer  int main   {  using namespace std; int num = 5;  cout << "We print " << num  << " lines hexadecimal" << endl;  hexMultiplicationTable cout.rdbuf  ,num ;  cout << "That was the output of " << num  << " hexadecimal lines " << endl;  The advantage of this approach is that the format does not need to be restored to its original state after it is modiﬁed, because the format applies to the stream object, not to the stream buffer. Thus, the corresponding output of the program is as follows:   822  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  We print 5 lines hexadecimal 0x1 0x2 0x3 0x4 0x5 0x6 0x7 0x8 0x9 0xa 0x2 0x4 0x6 0x8 0xa 0xc 0xe 0x10 0x12 0x14 0x3 0x6 0x9 0xc 0xf 0x12 0x15 0x18 0x1b 0x1e 0x4 0x8 0xc 0x10 0x14 0x18 0x1c 0x20 0x24 0x28 0x5 0xa 0xf 0x14 0x19 0x1e 0x23 0x28 0x2d 0x32 That was the output of 5 hexadecimal lines  However, the disadvantage of this approach is that construction and destruction of a stream object involve more overhead than just setting and restoring some format ﬂags. Also, note that the destruc- tion of a stream object does not ﬂush the buffer. To make sure that an output buffer is ﬂushed, it has to be ﬂushed manually.  that  The fact  the stream buffer is not destroyed applies only to basic_istream and basic_ostream. The other stream classes destroy the stream buffers they allocated originally, but they do not destroy stream buffers set with rdbuf  .  15.12.3 Redirecting Standard Streams  In the old implementation of the IOStream library, the global streams cin, cout, cerr, and clog were objects of the classes istream_withassign and ostream_withassign. It was therefore possible to redirect the streams by assigning streams to other streams. This possibility was removed from the C++ standard library. However, the possibility to redirect streams was retained and ex- tended to apply to all streams. A stream can be redirected by setting a stream buffer.  The setting of stream buffers means the redirection of I O streams controlled by the program without help from the operating system. For example, the following statements set things up such that output written to cout is not sent to the standard output channel but to the ﬁle cout.txt:  The function copyfmt   can be used to assign all format information of a given stream to another stream object:  std::ofstream file  "cout.txt" ; std::cout.rdbuf  file.rdbuf   ;  std::ofstream file  "cout.txt" ; file.copyfmt  std::cout ; std::cout.rdbuf  file.rdbuf   ;  Caution! The object file is local and is destroyed at the end of the block. This also destroys the corresponding stream buffer. This differs from the “normal” streams because ﬁle streams allocate their stream buffer objects at construction time and destroy them on destruction. Thus, in this exam- ple, cout can no longer be used for writing. In fact, it cannot even be destroyed safely at program termination. Thus, the old buffer should always be saved and restored later! The following example does this in the function redirect  :     io streamredirect1.cpp  include   include   include     15.12 Connecting Input and Output Streams  823  using namespace std;  void redirect ostream& ;  int main   {  cout << "the first row" << endl;  redirect cout ;  cout << "the last row" << endl;  }  void redirect  ostream& strm  {     save output buffer of the stream    - use unique pointer with deleter that ensures to restore    auto del = [&] streambuf* p  {  the original output buffer at the end of the function  strm.rdbuf p ;  };  unique_ptr  origBuffer strm.rdbuf  ,del ;  By using a unique pointer  see Section 5.2.5, page 98 , we can ensure that, even when resize   is left due to an exception, the original output buffer stored in origBuffer gets restored.19     redirect ouput into the ﬁle redirect.txt ofstream file "redirect.txt" ; strm.rdbuf  file.rdbuf   ;  file << "one row for the file" << endl; strm << "one row for the stream" << endl;  }    closes ﬁle AND its buffer automatically  The output of the program is this as follows: the first row the last row  The contents of the ﬁle redirect.txt are afterward:  one row for the file one row for the stream  19 Thanks to Daniel Krugler for pointing this out.  ¨   824  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  As you can see, the output written in redirect   to cout, using the parameter name strm, is sent to the ﬁle. The output written after the execution of redirect   in main   is sent to the restored output channel.  15.12.4 Streams for Reading and Writing  A ﬁnal example of the connection between streams is the use of the same stream for reading and writing. Normally, a ﬁle can be opened for reading and writing by using the class fstream:  std::fstream file  "example.txt", std::ios::in  std::ios::out ;  It is also possible to use two different stream objects, one for reading and one for writing. This can be done, for example, with the following declarations:  std::ofstream out  "example.txt", ios::in  ios::out ; std::istream  in  out.rdbuf   ;  The declaration of out opens the ﬁle. The declaration of in uses the stream buffer of out to read from it. Note that out must be opened for both reading and writing. If it is opened only for writing, reading from the stream will result in undeﬁned behavior. Also note that in is not of type ifstream but only of type istream. The ﬁle is already opened and there is a corresponding stream buffer. All that is needed is a second stream object. As in previous examples, the ﬁle is closed when the ﬁle stream object out is destroyed.  It is also possible to create a ﬁle stream buffer and install it in both stream objects. The code  looks like this:  std::filebuf buffer; std::ostream out  &buffer ; std::istream in  &buffer ; buffer.open "example.txt", std::ios::in  std::ios::out ; filebuf is the usual specialization of the class basic_filebuf  for the character type char.  This class deﬁnes the stream buffer class used by ﬁle streams.  The following program is a complete example. In a loop, four lines are written to a ﬁle. After  each writing of a line, the contents of the ﬁle are written to standard output:     io streamreadwrite1.cpp  include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {     open ﬁle ‘‘example.dat’’ for reading and writing filebuf buffer; ostream output &buffer ; istream input &buffer ;   15.12 Connecting Input and Output Streams  825  buffer.open  "example.dat", ios::in  ios::out  ios::trunc ;  for  int i=1; i<=4; i++  {     write one line output << i << ". line" << endl;     print all ﬁle contents input.seekg 0 ; char c; while  input.get c   {  cout.put c ;  } cout << endl; input.clear  ;     seek to the beginning     clear eofbit and failbit  The output of the program is as follows:  }  }  1. line  1. line 2. line  1. line 2. line 3. line  1. line 2. line 3. line 4. line  Although two different stream objects are used for reading and writing, the read and write positions are tightly coupled. seekg   and seekp   call the same member function of the stream buffer.20 Thus, the read position must always be set to the beginning of the ﬁle in order for the complete contents of the ﬁle to be written, after which the read write position is again at the end of the ﬁle so that new lines written are appended.  20 This function can distinguish whether the read position, the write position, or both positions are to be modi- ﬁed. Only the standard stream buffers maintain one position for reading and writing.   826  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  It is important to perform a seek between read and write operations to the same ﬁle unless you have reached the end of the ﬁle while reading. Without this seek, you are likely to end up with a garbled ﬁle or with even more fatal errors.  As mentioned before, instead of processing character by character, you could also print the entire contents in one statement by passing a pointer to the stream buffer of the ﬁle as an argument to operator <<  see Section 15.14.3, page 846, for details :  std::cout << input.rdbuf  ;  15.13 The Stream Buffer Classes  As mentioned in Section 15.2.1, page 749, reading and writing are not done by the streams directly but are delegated to stream buffers. The general interface to deal with stream buffers is pretty simple  see Section 15.12.2, page 820 :   rdbuf   yields a pointer to the stream buffer of a stream.   The constructor and rdbuf   of streams allow setting a stream buffer at construction time or changing the stream buffer while the stream exists. In both cases, you have to pass a pointer to the stream buffer, which is what rdbuf   returns.  This ability can be used to let streams write to the same output device  see Section 15.12.2, page 820, to redirect streams  see Section 15.12.3, page 822 , read from and write to the same buffer  see Section 15.12.4, page 824 , or use other character encodings, such as UTF-8 or UTF-16 UCS-2, as input and output format  see Section 16.4.4, page 903 .  This section describes how the stream buffer classes operate. The discussion not only gives a deeper understanding of what is going on when I O streams are used but also provides the basis to deﬁne new I O channels. Before going into the details of stream buffer operation, the public interface is presented for readers interested only in using stream buffers.  15.13.1 The Stream Buffer Interfaces  To the user of a stream buffer, the class basic_streambuf  is not much more than something that characters can be sent to or extracted from. Table 15.42 lists the public function for writing characters.  Member Function Meaning sputc c  sputn s, n   Sends the character c to the stream buffer Sends n characters from the sequence s to the stream buffer  Table15.42. PublicMembersforWritingCharacters  The function sputc   returns traits_type::eof   in case of an error, where traits_type is a type deﬁnition in the class basic_streambuf. The function sputn   writes the number of   15.13 The Stream Buffer Classes  827  characters speciﬁed by the second argument unless the stream buffer cannot consume them. It does not care about  terminating  null characters. This function returns the number of characters written. The interface to reading characters from a stream buffer is a little bit more complex  Table 15.43  because for input, it is necessary to have a look at a character without consuming it. Also, it is desirable that characters can be put back into the stream buffer when parsing. Thus, the stream buffer classes provide corresponding functions.  Member Function Meaning in_avail   sgetc   sbumpc   snextc   sgetn b, n  sputbackc c  sungetc    Returns a lower bound on the characters available Returns the current character without consuming it Returns the current character and consumes it Consumes the current character and returns the next character Reads n characters and stores them in the buffer b Returns the character c to the stream buffer Moves one step back to the previous character  Table15.43. PublicMembersforReadingCharacters  The function in_avail   can be used to determine how many characters are at least available. This function can be used, for example, to make sure that reading does not block when reading from the keyboard. However, more characters can be available.  Until the stream buffer has reached the end of the stream, there is a current character. The function sgetc   is used to get the current character without moving on to the next character. The function sbumpc   reads the current character and moves on to next character, making this the new current character. The last function reading a single character, snextc   makes the next character the current one and then reads this character. All three functions return traits_type::eof   to indicate failure. The function sgetn   reads a sequence of characters into a buffer. The maximum number of characters to be read is passed as an argument. The function returns the number of characters read.  The two functions sputbackc   and sungetc   are used to move one step back, making the previous character the current one. The function sputbackc   can be used to replace the previous character by another character. These two functions should be used only with care. Often, only one character can be put back.  Finally, there are functions to access the imbued locale object, to change the position, and to  inﬂuence buffering. Table 15.44 lists these functions.  Both pubimbue   and getloc   are used for internationalization  see Section 15.8, page 790 : pubimbue   installs a new locale object in the stream buffer, returning the previously installed locale object; getloc   returns the currently installed locale object.  The function pubsetbuf   is intended to provide some control over the buffering strategy of stream buffers. However, whether it is honored depends on the concrete stream buffer class. For ex- ample, it makes no sense to use pubsetbuf   for string stream buffers. Even for ﬁle stream buffers, the use of this function is portable only if it is called before the ﬁrst I O operation is performed and   828  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  Member Function pubimbue loc  getloc   pubseekpos pos  pubseekpos pos, which  pubseekoff offset, rpos   pubseekoff offset, rpos, which  pubsetbuf buf, n   Meaning Imbues the stream buffer with the locale loc Returns the current locale Repositions the current position to an absolute position Same with specifying the I O direction Repositions the current position relative to another po- sition Same with specifying the I O direction Inﬂuences buffering  Table15.44. MiscellaneousPublicStreamBufferFunctions  if it is called as pubsetbuf nullptr,0 , which means that no buffer is to be used. This function returns nullptr on failure and the stream buffer otherwise.  The functions pubseekoff   and pubseekpos   are used to manipulate the current position used for reading and or writing. The position that is manipulated depends on the last argument, which is of type ios_base::openmode and which defaults to ios_base::inios_base::out if it is not speciﬁed. If ios_base::in is set, the read position is modiﬁed. Correspondingly, the write position is modiﬁed if ios_base::out is set. The function pubseekpos   moves the stream to an absolute position speciﬁed as the ﬁrst argument, whereas the function pubseekoff   moves the stream relative to some other position. The offset is speciﬁed as the ﬁrst argument. The position used as starting point is speciﬁed as the second argument and can be ios_base::cur, ios_base::beg, or ios_base::end  see Section 15.9.4, page 800, for details . Both functions return the position to which the stream was positioned or an invalid stream position. The invalid stream position can be detected by comparing the result with the object pos_type off_type -1    pos_type and off_type are types for handling stream positions; see Section 15.9.4, page 799 . The current posi- tion of a stream can be obtained by using pubseekoff  :  sbuf.pubseekoff 0, std::ios::cur   15.13.2 Stream Buffer Iterators  An alternative way to use a member function for unformatted I O is to use the stream buffer iterator classes. These classes provide iterators that conform to input iterator or output iterator requirements and read or write individual characters from stream buffers. This ﬁts character-level I O into the algorithm library of the C++ standard library.  The class templates istreambuf_iterator  and ostreambuf_iterator  are used to read or to write individual characters from or to objects of type basic_streambuf , respectively. The classes are deﬁned in the header   like this:  namespace std {  template <typename charT,  typename traits = char_traits  > class istreambuf_iterator;   15.13 The Stream Buffer Classes  829  template <typename charT,  typename traits = char_traits  > class ostreambuf_iterator;  }  These iterators are special forms of stream iterators, which are described in Section 9.4.3, page 460. The only difference is that their elements are characters.  Output Stream Buffer Iterators  Here is how a string can be written to a stream buffer by using an ostreambuf_iterator:     create iterator for buffer of output stream cout std::ostreambuf_iterator  bufWriter std::cout ;  std::string hello "hello, world\n" ; std::copy hello.begin  , hello.end  ,  bufWriter ;     source: string    destination: output buffer of cout  The ﬁrst line of this example constructs an output iterator of type ostreambuf_iterator from the object cout. Instead of passing the output stream, you could also pass a pointer to the stream buffer directly. The remainder constructs a string object and copies the characters in this object to the constructed output iterator.  Table 15.45 lists all operations of output stream buffer iterators. The implementation is similar to ostream iterators  see Section 9.4.3, page 460 . In addition, you can initialize the iterator with a buffer, and you can call failed   to query whether the iterator is able to write. If any prior writing of a character failed, failed   yields true. In this case, any writing with operator = has no effect.  Expression ostreambuf_iterator  ostream   ostreambuf_iterator  buffer_ptr  Creates an output stream buffer iterator for  Effect Creates an output stream buffer iterator for ostream  the buffer to which buffer_ptr refers No-op  returns iter  Writes character c to the buffer by calling sputc c  for it No-op  returns iter  No-op  returns iter  Returns whether the output stream iterator is not able to write anymore  *iter iter = c  ++iter iter++ failed    Table15.45. OperationsofOutputStreamBufferIterators   830  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  Input Stream Buffer Iterators  Table 15.46 lists all operations of input stream buffer iterators. The implementation is similar to that for istream iterators  see Section 9.4.3, page 462 . In addition, you can initialize the iterator with a buffer, and member function equal   is provided, which returns whether two input stream buffer iterators are equal.

One possibility to get an end-of-stream iterator is to construct an iterator with the default constructor.

It is a modiﬁed version of the example in Section 15.5.3, page 772:     io charcat2.cpp  include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {     input stream buffer iterator for cin istreambuf_iterator  inpos cin ;     end-of-stream iterator istreambuf_iterator  endpos;     output stream buffer iterator for cout ostreambuf_iterator  outpos cout ;     while input iterator is valid while  inpos != endpos  {  *outpos = *inpos; ++inpos; ++outpos;     assign its value to the output iterator  }  }  }  You can also pass stream buffer iterators to algorithms to process all characters read from an input stream  see io countlines1.cpp for a complete example :  int countLines  std::istream& in  {  return std::count std::istreambuf_iterator  in ,  std::istreambuf_iterator   , ’\n’ ;  See Section 14.6, page 732, for an example using all characters read from standard input to initialize a string.   832  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  15.13.3 User-Deﬁned Stream Buffers  Stream buffers are buffers for I O. Their interface is deﬁned by class basic_streambuf . For the character types char and wchar_t, the specializations streambuf and wstreambuf, respectively, are predeﬁned. These classes are used as base classes when implementing the communication over special I O channels. However, doing this requires an understanding of the stream buffer’s operation. The central interface to the buffers is formed by three pointers for each of the two buffers. The pointers returned from the functions eback  , gptr  , and egptr   form the interface to the read buffer. The pointers returned from the functions pbase  , pptr  , and epptr   form the interface to the write buffer. These pointers are manipulated by the read and write operations, which may result in corresponding reactions in the corresponding read or write channel. The exact operation is examined separately for reading and writing.  User-Deﬁned Output Buffers  A buffer used to write characters is maintained with three pointers that can be accessed by the three functions pbase  , pptr  , and epptr    Figure 15.4 . Here is what these pointers represent: 1. pbase    “put base”  is the beginning of the output buffer. 2. pptr    “put pointer”  is the current write position. 3. epptr    “end put pointer”  is the end of the output buffer. This means that epptr   points to  one past the last character that can be buffered.  The characters in the range from pbase   to pptr  , not including the character pointed to by pptr  , are already written but not yet transported, or ﬂushed, to the corresponding output channel.  Figure15.4. InterfacetotheOutputBuffer  A character is written using the member function sputc  . This character is copied to the current write position if there is a spare write position. Then the pointer to the current write position is incremented. If the buffer is full  pptr   == epptr   , the contents of the output buffer are sent to the corresponding output channel by calling the virtual function overflow  . This function is responsible for sending the characters to some “external representation,” which may be internal, as in the case of string streams. The implementation of overflow   in the base class basic_streambuf returns only end-of-ﬁle, which indicates that no more characters could be written.  The member function sputn   can be used to write multiple characters at once. This function delegates the work to the virtual function xsputn  , which can be implemented for more efﬁcient   cid:29   cid:26   cid:8   cid:10   cid:20   cid:13   cid:14   cid:29   cid:29   cid:6   cid:7   cid:13   cid:14   cid:20   cid:29   cid:29   cid:6   cid:7   cid:13   cid:14   15.13 The Stream Buffer Classes  833  writing of multiple characters. The implementation of xsputn   in class basic_streambuf calls sputc   for each character. Thus, overriding xsputn   is not necessary. Often, however, writing multiple characters can be implemented more efﬁciently than writing characters one at a time. Thus, this function can be used to optimize the processing of character sequences.  Writing to a stream buffer does not necessarily involve using the buffer. Instead, the charac- ters can be written as soon as they are received. In this case, the value nullptr  or 0 or NULL  has to be assigned to the pointers that maintain the write buffer. The default constructor does this automatically.  With this information, the following example of a simple stream buffer can be implemented. This stream buffer does not use a buffer. Thus, the function overflow   is called for each character. Implementing this function is all that is necessary:     io outbuf1.hpp  include   include   include    class outbuf : public std::streambuf {  protected:     central output function    - print characters in uppercase mode virtual int_type overflow  int_type c  {  if  c != EOF  {     convert lowercase to uppercase c = std::toupper c,getloc   ;     and write the character to the standard output if  std::putchar c  == EOF  {  return EOF;  }  } return c;  }  };  In this case, each character sent to the stream buffer is written using the C function putchar  . However, before the character is written, it is turned into an uppercase character using toupper    see Section 16.4.4, page 895 . The function getloc   is used to get the locale object associated with the stream buffer  see also Section 15.8, page 790 .  In this example, the output buffer is implemented speciﬁcally for the character type char  streambuf is the specialization of basic_streambuf  for the character type char . If other character types are used, you have to implement this function using character traits, which are   834  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  introduced in Section 16.1.4, page 853. In this case, the comparison of c with end-of-ﬁle looks different: traits::eof   has to be returned instead of EOF and, if the argument c is EOF, the value traits::not_eof c  should be returned, where traits is the second template argument to basic_streambuf. This might look as follows:     io outbuf1i18n.hpp  include   include   include    template <typename charT,  typename traits = std::char_traits  >  class basic_outbuf : public std::basic_streambuf  {  protected:     central output function    - print characters in uppercase mode virtual typename traits::int_type  overflow  typename traits::int_type c  { if  !traits::eq_int_type c,traits::eof     {     convert lowercase to uppercase c = std::toupper c,this->getloc   ;     convert the character into a char  default: ’?’  char cc = std::use_facet >   this->getloc   .narrow c,’?’ ;     and write the character to the standard output if  std::putchar cc  == EOF  {  return traits::eof  ;  }  } return traits::not_eof c ;  }  };  typedef basic_outbuf  typedef basic_outbuf  woutbuf;  outbuf;  Note that you have to qualify the call of getloc   by this-> now because the base class depends on a template parameter. Also, we have to narrow the character before we pass it to putchar   because putchar   only accepts char only  see Section 16.4.4, page 891 .   15.13 The Stream Buffer Classes  835  Using this stream buffer in the following program:     io outbuf1.cpp  include   include "outbuf1.hpp"  int main   {  }  produces the following output:  31 HEXADECIMAL: 1F  outbuf ob; std::ostream out &ob ;     create special output buffer    initialize output stream with that output buffer  out << "31 hexadecimal: " << std::hex << 31 << std::endl;  The same approach can be used to write to other arbitrary destinations. For example, the constructor of a stream buffer may take a ﬁle descriptor, the name of a socket connection, or two other stream buffers used for simultaneous writing to initialize the object. Writing to the corresponding destina- tion requires only that overflow   be implemented. In addition, the function xsputn   should be implemented to make writing to the stream buffer more efﬁcient.  For convenient construction of the stream buffer, it is also reasonable to implement a special stream class that mainly passes the constructor argument to the corresponding stream buffer. The next example demonstrates this. It deﬁnes a stream buffer class initialized with a ﬁle descriptor to which characters are written with the function write  , a low-level I O function used on UNIX-like operating systems. In addition, a class derived from ostream is deﬁned that maintains such a stream buffer to which the ﬁle descriptor is passed:     io outbuf2.hpp  include   include   include       for write  : ifdef _MSC_VER include   else include   endif  class fdoutbuf : public std::streambuf {  protected:  int fd;     ﬁle descriptor   836  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  public:     constructor fdoutbuf  int _fd  : fd _fd  { }  protected:     write one character virtual int_type overflow  int_type c  {  if  c != EOF  { char z = c; if  write  fd, &z, 1  != 1  {  return EOF;  }  } return c;  }    write multiple characters virtual std::streamsize xsputn  const char* s,  return write fd,s,num ;  std::streamsize num  {  class fdostream : public std::ostream {  fdostream  int fd  : std::ostream 0 , buf fd  {  }  };  }  };  protected:  fdoutbuf buf;  public:  rdbuf &buf ;     io outbuf2.cpp  include   include "outbuf2.hpp"  This stream buffer also implements the function xsputn   to avoid calling overflow   for each character if a character sequence is sent to this stream buffer. This function writes the whole character sequence with one call to the ﬁle identiﬁed by the ﬁle descriptor fd. The function xsputn   returns the number of characters written successfully. Here is a sample application:   15.13 The Stream Buffer Classes  837  int main   {  }  fdostream out 1 ;     stream with buffer writing to ﬁle descriptor 1  out << "31 hexadecimal: " << std::hex << 31 << std::endl;  This program creates an output stream that is initialized with the ﬁle descriptor 1. This ﬁle descriptor, by convention, identiﬁes the standard output channel. Thus, in this example, the characters are simply printed. If some other ﬁle descriptor is available — for example, for a ﬁle or a socket — it also can be used as the constructor argument.  To implement a stream buffer that buffers, the write buffer has to be initialized using the function  setp  . This is demonstrated by the next example:     io outbuf3.hpp  include   include       for write  : ifdef _MSC_VER  include   else  include   endif  }  }     destructor    - ﬂush data buffer virtual ~outbuf   {  sync  ;  class outbuf : public std::streambuf {  protected:  static const int bufferSize = 10; char buffer[bufferSize];     size of data buffer    data buffer  public:     constructor    - initialize data buffer    - one character less to let the bufferSizeth character cause a call of overflow   outbuf   {  setp  buffer, buffer+ bufferSize-1  ;   838  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  protected:     ﬂush the characters in the buffer int flushBuffer    {  int num = pptr  -pbase  ; if  write  1, buffer, num  != num  {  return EOF;  } pbump  -num ; return num;     reset put pointer accordingly     buffer full    - write c and all previous characters virtual int_type overflow  int_type c  {  }  }  if  c != EOF  {     insert character into the buffer *pptr   = c; pbump 1 ;  }    ﬂush the buffer if  flushBuffer   == EOF  {     ERROR return EOF;  } return c;     synchronize data with ﬁle destination    - ﬂush the data in the buffer virtual int sync    {  if  flushBuffer   == EOF  {     ERROR return -1;  } return 0;  }  };  The constructor initializes the write buffer with setp  :  setp  buffer, buffer+ size-1  ;  The write buffer is set up such that overflow   is already called when there is still room for one character. If overflow   is not called with EOF as the argument, the corresponding character can   15.13 The Stream Buffer Classes  839  be written to the write position because the pointer to the write position is not increased beyond the end pointer. After the argument to overflow   is placed in the write position, the whole buffer can be emptied.  The member function flushBuffer   does exactly this. It writes the characters to the standard output channel  ﬁle descriptor 1  using the function write  . The stream buffer’s member function pbump   is used to move the write position back to the beginning of the buffer.  The function overflow   inserts the character that caused the call of overflow   into the buffer if it is not EOF. Then, pbump   is used to advance the write position to reﬂect the new end of the buffered characters. This moves the write position beyond the end position  epptr    temporarily.  This class also features the virtual function sync  , which is used to synchronize the current state of the stream buffer with the corresponding storage medium. Normally, all that needs to be done is to ﬂush the buffer. For the unbuffered versions of the stream buffer, overriding this function was not necessary, because there was no buffer to be ﬂushed.  The virtual destructor ensures that data is written that is still buffered when the stream buffer is  destroyed.  These are the functions that are overridden for most stream buffers. If the external representation has some special structure, overriding additional functions may be useful. For example, the functions seekoff   and seekpos   may be overridden to allow manipulation of the write position.  User-Deﬁned Input Buffers  The input mechanism works basically the same as the output mechanism. However, for input there is also the possibility of undoing the last read. The functions sungetc  , called by unget   of the input stream, or sputbackc  , called by putback   of the input stream, can be used to re- store the stream buffer to its state before the last read. It is also possible to read the next character without moving the read position beyond this character. Thus, you must override more functions to implement reading from a stream buffer than is necessary to implement writing to a stream buffer.  A stream buffer maintains a read buffer with three pointers that can be accessed through the  member functions eback  , gptr  , and egptr    Figure 15.5 : 1. eback    “end back”  is the beginning of the input buffer, or, as the name suggests, the end of the putback area. The character can only be put back up to this position without taking special action.  2. gptr    “get pointer”  is the current read position. 3. egptr    “end get pointer”  is the end of the input buffer. The characters between the read position and the end position have been transported from the exter- nal representation to the program’s memory, but they still await processing by the program.  Single characters can be read using the function sgetc   or sbumpc  . These two functions differ in that the read pointer is incremented by sbumpc   but not by sgetc  . If the buffer is read completely  gptr   == egptr   , no character is available, and the buffer has to be reﬁlled by a call of the virtual function underflow  , which is responsible for the reading of data. If no characters are available, the function sbumpc   calls the virtual function uflow   instead. The   840  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  Figure15.5. InterfaceforReadingfromStreamBuffers  default implementation of uflow   is to call underflow   and then increment the read pointer. The default implementation of underflow   in the base class basic_streambuf is to return EOF. This means that it is impossible to read characters with the default implementation.  The function sgetn   is used for reading multiple characters at once. This function delegates the processing to the virtual function xsgetn  . The default implementation of xsgetn   simply extracts multiple characters by calling sbumpc   for each character. Like the function xsputn   for writing, xsgetn   can be implemented to optimize the reading of multiple characters.  For input, it is not sufﬁcient simply to override one function, as it is in the case of output. Either a buffer has to be set up, or, at the very least, underflow   and uflow   have to implemented. The reason is that underflow   does not move past the current character, but underflow   may be called from sgetc  . Moving on to the next character has to be done using buffer manipulation or a call to uflow  . In any case, underflow   has to be implemented for any stream buffer capable of reading characters. If both underflow   and uflow   are implemented, there is no need to set up a buffer.  A read buffer is set up with the member function setg  , which takes three arguments in this  order: 1. A pointer to the beginning of the buffer  eback    2. A pointer to the current read position  gptr    3. A pointer to the end of the buffer  egptr    Unlike setp  , setg   takes three arguments in order to be able to deﬁne the room for storing characters that are put back into the stream. Thus, when the pointers to the read buffer are being set up, it is reasonable to have at least one character that is already read but still stored in the buffer.  As mentioned, characters can be put back into the read buffer by using the functions sputbackc   and sungetc  . sputbackc   gets the character to be put back as its argument and ensures that this character was indeed the character read. Both functions decrement the read pointer, if possible. Of course, this works only as long as the read pointer is not at the beginning of the read buffer. If you attempt to put a character back after the beginning of the buffer is reached, the virtual function pbackfail   is called. By overriding this function, you can implement a mechanism to re- store the old read position even in this case. In the base class basic_streambuf, no corresponding behavior is deﬁned. Thus, in practice, it is not possible to go back an arbitrary number of characters. For streams that do not use a buffer, the function pbackfail   should be implemented because it is generally assumed that at least one character can be put back into the stream.   cid:20   cid:26   cid:8   cid:2  !  cid:13   cid:14   cid:27   cid:29   cid:6   cid:7   cid:13   cid:14   cid:20   cid:27   cid:29   cid:6   cid:7   cid:13   cid:14   15.13 The Stream Buffer Classes  841  If a new buffer was just read, another problem arises: Not even one character can be put back if the old data is not saved in the buffer. Thus, the implementation of underflow   often moves the last few characters  for example, four characters  of the current buffer to the beginning of the buffer and appends the newly read characters thereafter. This allows some characters to be moved back before pbackfail   is called.  The following example demonstrates how such an implementation might look.  In the class inbuf, an input buffer with ten characters is implemented. This buffer is split into a maximum of four characters for the putback area and six characters for the “normal” input buffer:     io inbuf1.hpp  include   include   include       for read  : ifdef _MSC_VER  include   else  include   endif  class inbuf : public std::streambuf {  protected:     data buffer:    - at most, four characters in putback area plus    - at most, six characters in ordinary read buffer static const int bufferSize = 10; char buffer[bufferSize];     size of the data buffer    data buffer  public:     constructor    - initialize empty data buffer    - no putback area    => force underflow   inbuf   {  setg  buffer+4, buffer+4, buffer+4 ;     beginning of putback area    read position    end position  }   842  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  }  }  }  protected:     insert new characters into the buffer virtual int_type underflow    {     is read position before end of buffer? if  gptr   < egptr    {  return traits_type::to_int_type *gptr   ;     process size of putback area    - use number of characters read    - but at most four int numPutback; numPutback = gptr   - eback  ; if  numPutback > 4  {  numPutback = 4;     copy up to four characters previously read into    the putback buffer  area of ﬁrst four characters  std::memmove  buffer+ 4-numPutback , gptr  -numPutback,  numPutback ;     read new characters int num; num = read  0, buffer+4, bufferSize-4 ; if  num <= 0  {     ERROR or EOF return EOF;     reset buffer pointers setg  buffer+ 4-numPutback ,  buffer+4, buffer+4+num ;     beginning of putback area    read position    end of buffer     return next character return traits_type::to_int_type *gptr   ;  }  };  The constructor initializes all pointers so that the buffer is completely empty  Figure 15.6 . If a character is read from this stream buffer, the function underflow   is called. This function, always used by this stream buffer to read the next characters, starts by checking for read characters in the   15.13 The Stream Buffer Classes  843  input buffer. If characters are present, they are moved to the putback area by using the function memcpy  . These are, at most, the last four characters of the input buffer. Then POSIX’s low-level I O function read   is used to read the next character from the standard input channel. After the buffer is adjusted to the new situation, the ﬁrst character read is returned.  Figure15.6. GetBufferafterInitialization  For example, if the characters ’H’, ’a’, ’l’, ’l’, ’o’, and ’w’ are read by the ﬁrst call to read  , the state of the input buffer changes, as shown in Figure 15.7. The putback area is empty because the buffer was ﬁlled for the ﬁrst time, and there are no characters yet that can be put back.  Figure15.7. GetBufferafterReading H a l l o w  After these characters are extracted, the last four characters are moved into the putback area, and new characters are read. For example, if the characters ’e’, ’e’, ’n’, and ’\n’ are read by the next call of read  , the result is as shown in Figure 15.8.  Figure15.8.

After the eighth character is read, two characters are put back. Thus, the seventh and eighth characters are printed twice.  15.14 Performance Issues  This section addresses issues that focus on performance. In general, the stream classes should be pretty efﬁcient, but performance can be improved further in applications in which I O is performance critical.  One performance issue was mentioned in Section 15.2.3, page 752, already: You should include only those headers that are necessary to compile your code. In particular, you should avoid including   if the standard stream objects are not used.   15.14 Performance Issues  845  15.14.1 Synchronization with C’s Standard Streams  By default, the eight C++ standard streams — the four narrow character streams cin, cout, cerr, and clog, and their wide-character counterparts — are synchronized with the corresponding ﬁles from the C standard library: stdin, stdout, and stderr. By default, clog and wclog use the same stream buffer as cerr and wcerr, respectively. Thus, they are also synchronized with stderr by default, although there is no direct counterpart in the C standard library.  Depending on the implementation, this synchronization might imply some often unnecessary overhead. For example, implementing the standard C++ streams using the standard C ﬁles inhibits buffering in the corresponding stream buffers. However, the buffer in the stream buffers is necessary for some optimizations, especially during formatted reading  see Section 15.14.2, page 845 . To allow switching to a better implementation, the static member function sync_with_stdio   is deﬁned for the class ios_base  Table 15.47 .  Static Function sync_with_stdio    Meaning Returns whether the standard stream objects are synchronized with standard C streams and concurrency is supported  sync_with_stdio false  Disables the synchronization of C++ and C streams   has to be called before any I O   Table15.47. SynchronizingStandardC++andStandardCStreams  sync_with_stdio   takes as argument an optional Boolean value that determines whether the synchronization with the standard C streams should be turned on. Thus, to turn the synchronization off, you have to pass false as the argument:  std::ios::sync_with_stdio false ;     disable synchronization  Note that you have to disable the synchronization before any other I O operation. Calling this func- tion after any I O has occurred results in implementation-deﬁned behavior.  The function returns the previous value with which the function was called. If not called before,  it always returns true to reﬂect the default setup of the standard streams.  Note that since C++11, disabling the synchronization with the standard C streams also disables the concurrency support, which allows you to use the standard stream object by multiple threads, although interleaved characters are possible  see Section 4.5, page 56 .  15.14.2 Buffering in Stream Buffers  Buffering I O is important for efﬁciency. One reason for this is that system calls are, in general, rela- tively expensive, and it pays to avoid them if possible. There is, however, another, more subtle reason in C++ for doing buffering in stream buffers, at least for input: The functions for formatted I O use stream buffer iterators to access the streams, and operating on stream buffer iterators is slower than operating on pointers. The difference is not that big, but it is sufﬁcient to justify improved imple-   846  Chapter 15: Input Output Using Stream Classes  mentations for frequently used operations, such as formatted reading of numeric values. However, for such improvements, it is essential that stream buffers are buffered.  Thus, all I O is done using stream buffers, which implement a mechanism for buffering. How- ever, it is not sufﬁcient to rely solely on this buffering, because three aspects conﬂict with effective buffering: 1.  It is often simpler to implement stream buffers without buffering. If the corresponding streams are not used frequently or are used only for output, buffering is probably not that important.  For output, the difference between stream buffer iterators and pointers is not as bad as for input; the main problem is comparing stream buffer iterators.  However, for stream buffers that are used extensively, buffering should deﬁnitely be implemented.  2. The ﬂag unitbuf causes output streams to ﬂush the stream after each output operation. Corre- spondingly, the manipulators flush and endl also ﬂush the stream. For the best performance, all three should probably be avoided. However, when writing to the console, for example, it is probably still reasonable to ﬂush the stream after writing complete lines. If you are stuck with a program that makes heavy use of unitbuf, flush, or endl, you might consider using a special stream buffer that does not use sync   to ﬂush the stream buffer but uses another function that is called when appropriate.  3. Tieing streams with the tie   function  see Section 15.12.1, page 819  also results in additional  ﬂushing of streams. Thus, streams should be tied only if it is really necessary.  When implementing new stream buffers, it may be reasonable to implement them without buffering ﬁrst. Then, if the stream buffer is identiﬁed as a bottleneck, it is still possible to implement buffering without affecting anything in the remainder of the application.  15.14.3 Using Stream Buffers Directly  All member functions of the class basic_istream and basic_ostream that read or write charac- ters operate according to the same schema: First, a corresponding sentry object is constructed, and then the operation is performed. The construction of the sentry object results in ﬂushing of poten- tially tied objects, skipping of whitespace for input, and such implementation-speciﬁc operations as locking in multithreaded environments  see Section 15.5.4, page 772 .  For unformatted I O, most of the operations are normally useless anyway. Only locking oper- ation might be useful if the streams are used in multithreaded environments. Thus, when doing unformatted I O, it may be better to use stream buffers directly.   By passing a pointer to a stream buffer to operator <<, you can output all input of its device. This  To support this behavior, you can use operators  > with stream buffers as follows:  is probably the fastest way to copy ﬁles by using C++ I O streams. For example:     io copy1.cpp  include     15.14 Performance Issues  847  Here, rdbuf   yields the buffer of cin  see Section 15.12.2, page 820 . Thus, the program copies all standard input to standard output.   By passing a pointer to a stream buffer to operator >>, you can read directly into a stream buffer.  For example, you could also copy all standard input to standard output in the following way:  int main    {     copy all standard input to standard output std::cout << std::cin.rdbuf  ;  }  }     io copy2.cpp  include    int main    {     copy all standard input to standard output std::cin >> std::noskipws >> std::cout.rdbuf  ;  Note that you have to clear the ﬂag skipws. Otherwise, leading whitespace of the input is skipped  see Section 15.7.7, page 789 .  Even for formatted I O, it may be reasonable to use stream buffers directly. For example, if many numeric values are read in a loop, it is sufﬁcient to construct just one sentry object that exists for the whole time the loop is executed. Then, within the loop, whitespace is skipped manually — using the ws manipulator would also construct a sentry object — and then the facet num_get  see Section 16.4.1, page 873  is used for reading the numeric values directly.  Note that a stream buffer has no error state of its own. It also has no knowledge of the input or  output stream that might connect to it. So, calling     copy contents of in to out out << in.rdbuf  ;  can’t change the error state of in due to a failure or end-of-ﬁle.

As a consequence, the C++ standard library provides concepts to write code for international programs. These concepts inﬂuence mainly the use of I O and string process- ing. This chapter describes these concepts. Many thanks to Dietmar Kuhl, who is an expert on I O and internationalization in the C++ standard library and wrote major parts of this chapter.  ¨  The C++ standard library provides a general approach to support national conventions without being bound to speciﬁc conventions. This goes to the extent, for example, that strings are not bound to a speciﬁc character type to support 16-bit characters in Asia. For the internationalization of programs, two related aspects are important: 1. Different character sets have different properties, so ﬂexible solutions are required for such prob- lems as what is considered to be a letter or, worse, what type to use to represent characters. For character sets with more than 256 characters, type char is not sufﬁcient as a representation.  2. The user of a program expects to see national or cultural conventions obeyed, such as the format-  ting of dates, monetary values, numbers, and Boolean values.  For both aspects, the C++ standard library provides related solutions.  The major approach toward internationalization is to use locale objects to represent an extensible collection of aspects to be adapted to speciﬁc local conventions. Locales are already used in C for this purpose. In the C++ standard, this mechanism was generalized and made more ﬂexible. In fact, the C++ locale mechanism can be used to address all kinds of customization, depending on the user’s environment or preferences. For example, it can be extended to deal with measurement systems, time zones, or paper size.  Most of the mechanisms of internationalization involve only minimal, if any, additional work for the programmer. For example, when doing I O with the C++ stream mechanism, numeric values are formatted according to the rules of some locale. The only work for the programmer is to instruct the I O stream classes to use the user’s preferences. In addition to such automatic use, the programmer may use locale objects directly for formatting, collation, character classiﬁcation, and so on.  1 The common abbreviation for internationalization, i18n, stands for the letter i, followed by 18 characters, followed by the letter n.   850  Chapter 16: Internationalization  Strings and streams use another concept for internationalization: character traits. They deﬁne fundamental properties and operations that differ for different character sets, such as the value of “end-of-ﬁle” as well as functions to compare, assign, and copy strings.

Today in the area of globalization, there are character set stan- dards of up to 32 bits, with more than 1 million different character values.2 As a consequence, there are different standards and approaches to deal with characters in different countries and cultures.  16.1.1 Multibyte and Wide-Character Text  Two different approaches are common to address character sets that have more than 256 characters: multibyte representation and wide-character representation: 1. With multibyte representation, the number of bytes used for a character is variable. A 1-byte character, such as an ISO-Latin-1 character, can be followed by a 3-byte character, such as a Japanese ideogram.  2. With wide-character representation, the number of bytes used to represent a character is always the same, independent of the character being represented. Typical representations use 2 or 4  2 Current 32-bit character sets use the values up to 0x10FFFF, which are 1,114,111 values.   16.1 Character Encodings and Character Sets  851  bytes. Conceptually, this does not differ from representations that use just 1 byte for locales where ISO-Latin-1 or even ASCII is sufﬁcient.  Multibyte representation is more compact than wide-character representation. Thus, the multibyte representation is normally used to store data outside of programs. Conversely, it is much easier to process characters of ﬁxed size, so the wide-character representation is usually used inside programs. In a multibyte string, the same byte may represent a character or even just a part of the character. During iteration through a multibyte string, each byte is interpreted according to a current “shift state.” Depending on the value of the byte and the current shift state, a byte may represent a certain character or a change of the current shift state. A multibyte string always starts in a deﬁned initial shift state. For example, in the initial shift state, the bytes may represent ISO-Latin-1 characters until an escape character is encountered. The character following the escape character identiﬁes the new shift state. For example, that character may switch to a shift state in which the bytes are interpreted as Arabic characters until the next escape character is encountered.  16.1.2 Different Character Sets  The most important character sets are:   US-ASCII, a 7-bit character set standardized since 1963 for teleprinters and other devices, so that the ﬁrst 16 values are “nonprintable characters,” such as carriage-return, horizontal tab, backspace, or a bell. This character set serves as base for all other character sets, and usually the values between 0x20 and 0x7F have the same characters in all other character sets.   ISO-Latin-1 or ISO-8859-1  see [ISOLatin1] , an 8-bit character set, standardized since 1987 to provide all characters of the “Western Europe” languages. Also, this character set serves as base for all other character sets, and usually the values between 0x20 and 0x7F and from 0xA0 to 0xFF have the same characters in all other character sets.   ISO-Latin-9 or ISO-8859-15  see [ISOLatin9] , an 8-bit character set, standardized since 1999 to provide an improved version of all characters of the “Western Europe” languages by replacing some less common symbols with the euro sign and other special characters.   UCS-2, a 16-bit ﬁxed-sized character set, providing the 65,536 most important characters of the   UTF-8  see [UTF8] , a multibyte character-set using between one and four octets of 8 bits to represent all characters of the Universal Character Set and Unicode standards. It is widely used in the world of the World Wide Web.   UTF-16, a multibyte character-set using between one and two code units of 16 bits to represent   UCS-4 or UTF-32, a 32-bit ﬁxed-sized character set, providing all standardized characters of the  all characters of the Universal Character Set and Unicode standards.  Universal Character Set and Unicode standards.  Universal Character Set and Unicode standards.  Note that UTF-16 and UTF-32 might have a byte order mark  BOM  at the beginning of the whole character sequence to mark whether big-endian  default  or little-endian byte order is used. Alter- natively, you can explicitly specify UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32BE, or UTF-32LE.   852  Chapter 16: Internationalization  n   j   ä   +   €   1   7-Bit ASCII   6E   6A   20  n.a.  20   2B   20  n.a.   20   31   8-Bit ISO-8859-1   6E   6A   20  E4  20   2B   20  n.a.   20   31   8-Bit ISO-8859-15   6E   6A   20  E4  20   2B   20  A4   20   31   8-Bit Windows-1252   6E   6A   20  E4  20   2B   20  80   20   31   UTF-8   6E   6A   20  C3  A4   20   2B   20  E2   82   AC   20   31   UTF-16   USC-2   006E   006A   0020   00E4   0020   002B   0020   20AC   0020   0031   UTF-32   USC-4   0000006E   0000006A   00000020   000000E4   00000020   ...   n  j   ä   Figure16.1. HexadecimalCharacterCodesofDifferentCharacterSets  Figure 16.1 shows the different hexadecimal encodings of an example character sequence, using ordinary ASCII characters, the German umlaut ¨a, and the euro symbol e. Here, UTF-16 and UTF-32 use no byte order marks. A byte order mark would have the value 0xFEFF.  Note that UTF-16 and UCS-2 almost match for the characters up to the value 0xFFFF. Only for very special characters not available in UCS-2, UTF-16 uses two code units of 16 bits given that UCS-2 is a multibyte character set.  16.1.3 Dealing with Character Sets in C++  Latin-9. In addition, it can be used for octets of UTF-8.  C++ provides different character types to deal with these character sets:   char can be used for all character sets up to 8 bits, such as US-ASCII, ISO-Latin-1, and ISO-   char16_t  provided since C++11  can be used for UCS-2 and as code unit for UTF-16.   char32_t  provided since C++11  can be used for UCS-4 UTF-32.   wchar_t is the type for the values of the largest extended character set among all supported  locales. Thus, it is usually equivalent to char16_t or char32_t.  All these types are keywords, so it is possible to overload functions with all these types. Note, however, that the support of char16_t and char32_t is limited. Although character traits provide the ability to deal with Unicode strings, no overloads for these types for I O are provided.   16.1 Character Encodings and Character Sets  853  Note that since C++11, you can specify string literals using different character encodings  see  Section 3.1.6, page 24, for details .  To support character and code conversions, the C++ standard library provides the following features:   To convert strings into wstrings and vice versa, you can use the member functions widen   and narrow   of the ctype  facet  see Section 16.4.4, page 891 . Note that they also can be used to convert characters of the native character set into characters of a locale’s character set, both using the character type char.   To convert multibyte sequences into wstrings and vice versa, you can use the class template wstring_convert  and the corresponding codecvt  facets  see Section 16.4.4, page 901 .   Class codecvt   see Section 16.4.4, page 897  is also used by class basic_filebuf   see Section 15.9.1, page 791  to convert between internal and external representations when reading or writing ﬁles.   To read or write multibyte character sequences, you can use class wbuffer_convert  and the  corresponding codecvt  facets  see Section 16.4.4, page 903 .  16.1.4 Character Traits  The different representations of character sets imply variations that are relevant for the processing of strings and I O. For example, the value used to represent “end-of-ﬁle” or the details of comparing characters may differ for representations.  The string and stream classes are intended to be instantiated with built-in types, especially with char and wchar_t, and, since C++11, maybe with char16_t and char32_t. The interface of built-in types cannot be changed. Thus, the details on how to deal with aspects that depend on the representation are factored into a separate class, a so-called traits class. Both the string and stream classes take a traits class as a template argument. This argument defaults to the class char_traits, parametrized with the template argument that deﬁnes the character type of the string or stream:  namespace std {  template <typename charT,  typename traits = char_traits , typename Allocator = allocator > class basic_string;  namespace std {  template <typename charT,  typename traits = char_traits > class basic_istream;  template <typename charT,  typename traits = char_traits > class basic_ostream;  }  ...  }   854  Chapter 16: Internationalization  The character traits have type char_traits . This type is deﬁned in   and is parame- trized on the speciﬁc character type:  namespace std {  template   struct char_traits {  ...  };  }  The traits classes deﬁne all fundamental properties of the character type and the corresponding op- erations necessary for the implementation of strings and streams as static components. Table 16.1 lists the members of char_traits.

CharacterTraitsMembers   16.1 Character Encodings and Character Sets  855  The functions that process strings or character sequences are present for optimization only. They could also be implemented by using the functions that process single characters. For example, copy   can be implemented using assign  . However, there might be more efﬁcient implementa- tions when dealing with strings.  Note that counts used in the functions are exact counts, not maximum counts. That is, string-  termination characters within these sequences are ignored.  The last group of functions concerns the special processing of the character that represents end- of-ﬁle  EOF . This character extends the character set by an artiﬁcial character to indicate special processing. For some representations, the character type may be insufﬁcient to accommodate this special character because it has to have a value that differs from the values of all “normal” char- acters of the character set. C established the convention to return a character as int instead of as char from functions reading characters. This technique was extended in C++. The charac- ter traits deﬁne char_type as the type to represent all characters and int_type as the type to represent all characters plus EOF. The functions to_char_type  , to_int_type  , not_eof  , and eq_int_type   deﬁne the corresponding conversions and comparisons. It is possible that char_type and int_type are identical for some character traits. This can be the case if not all values of char_type are necessary to represent characters so that a spare value can be used for end-of-ﬁle.  pos_type and off_type are used to deﬁne ﬁle positions and offsets, respectively  see Sec-  tion 15.9.4, page 799, for details .  The C++ standard library provides specializations of char_traits  for types char and  wchar_t and, since C++11, for char16_t and char32_t:  The specialization for char is usually implemented by using the global string functions of C that are deﬁned in   or  . An implementation might look as follows:  namespace std {  template  struct char_traits ; template  struct char_traits ; template  struct char_traits ; template  struct char_traits ;  }  namespace std {  template  struct char_traits  {     type deﬁnitions: char_type; typedef char typedef int int_type; typedef streampos pos_type; typedef streamoff off_type; typedef mbstate_t state_type;     functions: static void assign char& c1, const char& c2  {  c1 = c2;  }   856  Chapter 16: Internationalization  static bool eq const char& c1, const char& c2  {  return c1 == c2;  } static bool lt const char& c1, const char& c2  {  return c1 < c2;  } static size_t length const char* s  {  return strlen s ;  } static int compare const char* s1, const char* s2, size_t n  {  return memcmp s1,s2,n ;  } static char* copy char* s1, const char* s2, size_t n  {  return  char* memcpy s1,s2,n ;  } static char* move char* s1, const char* s2, size_t n  {  return  char* memmove s1,s2,n ;  } static char* assign char* s, size_t n, char c  {  return  char* memset s,c,n ;  } static const char* find const char* s, size_t n,  return  const char* memchr s,c,n ;  const char& c  {  } static int eof   {  return EOF;  } static int to_int_type const char& c  {  return  int  unsigned char c;  } static char to_char_type const int& i  {  return  char i;  } static int not_eof const int& i  {  return i!=EOF ? i : !EOF;  } static bool eq_int_type const int& i1, const int& i2  {  return i1 == i2;  }  };  }   16.2 The Concept of Locales  857  See Section 13.2.15, page 689, for the implementation of a user-deﬁned traits class that lets strings behave in a case-insensitive manner.  16.1.5 Internationalization of Special Characters  One issue with character encodings remains: How are special characters, such as the newline or the string termination character, internationalized? The class basic_ios  has members widen   and narrow   that can be used for this purpose. Thus, the newline character in an encoding appropriate for the stream strm can be written as follows:  strm.widen ’\n’      internationalized newline character  The string-termination character in the same encoding can be created like this:    internationalized string-termination character  strm.widen ’\0’   See the implementation of the endl manipulator in Section 15.6.2, page 777, for an example use.  The functions widen   and narrow   use a locale object: more precisely, the ctype  facet of this object. This facet can be used to convert all characters between char and some other character representations. It is described in Section 16.4.4, page 891. For example, the following expression converts the character c of type char into an object of type charType by using the locale object loc:  std::use_facet > loc .widen c   The details of the use of locales and their facets are described in the following sections.  16.2 The Concept of Locales  A common approach to internationalization is to use environments, called locales, to encapsulate national or cultural conventions. The C community uses this approach. Thus, in the context of internationalization, a locale is a collection of parameters and functions used to support national or cultural conventions. According to X Open conventions,3 the environment variable LANG is used to deﬁne the locale to be used. Depending on this locale, different formats for ﬂoating-point numbers, dates, monetary values, and so on, are used.  The format of the string deﬁning a locale is normally this: language[_area[.code]][@modiﬁer]  where   language represents the language, such as English or German. It is usually a string of two lower-   area is the area, country, or culture where this language is used. It is usually a string of two  case letters, such as en or de.  uppercase letters, such as US or DE.  3 POSIX and X Open are standards for operating system interfaces.   858  Chapter 16: Internationalization    code deﬁnes the character encoding to be used. This, for example, is important in Asia, where different character encodings are used to represent the same character set. Examples are: utf8, ISO-8859-1, eucJP.   modiﬁer is allowed on some platforms to specify additional modiﬁcations, such as @euro for  using the euro symbol or @phone for sorting according to the telephone directory.  Table 16.2 presents a selection of typical language strings, especially on POSIX systems. However, note that these strings are not portable. In fact, multiple standards are involved and proprietary values are used. For example, to use a German locale with an ISO-Latin1-like character set including the euro symbol, you might have to specify de_DE.ISO-8859-15 or de_DE@euro or deu_deu.1252 or deu_germany or just german.  Note that the euro symbol might have different integral values because different character sets are used.  The following references might help:   For the language, ISO639  see [ISO639:LangCodes]  deﬁnes two-letter acronyms, such as en or de, usually used by POSIX environments, and three-letter acronyms, such as eng and deu, usually supported by Windows platforms.   For the area, ISO3166  see [ISO3166:CodeTab]  deﬁnes two-letter acronyms, such as US or DE,   See [VisualC++Locales] for the language, area, and code on Windows platforms, which use  usually used by POSIX environments. Note that Windows uses different codes here.  slightly different character sets.  For programs, that these names are not standardized is normally no problem because the locale information usually is provided by the user in some form. It is common that programs simply read environment variables or some similar database to determine which locales to use. Thus, the burden of ﬁnding the correct locale names is put on the users. Only if the program always uses a special locale does the name need to be hard-coded in the program. Normally, for this case, the C locale is sufﬁcient, and is guaranteed to be supported by all implementations and to have the name C.  The next section presents the use of different locales in C++ programs. In particular, it introduces  locale facets, which are used to deal with speciﬁc formatting details.  C also provides an approach to handle the problem of character sets with more than 256 char- acters. This approach is to ﬁrst use the character types wchar_t, a type deﬁnition for one of the integral types with language support for wide-character constants and wide-character string literals. However, apart from this, only functions to convert between wide characters and narrow charac- ters are supported. This approach was also incorporated into C++ with the character type wchar_t, which is, unlike the C approach, a distinct type in C++. However, C++ provides more library support than C, because everything available for char is also available for wchar_t, and any other type may be used as a character type.  Since C++11, types char16_t and char32_t also are supported. However, this is not done throughout the library. For example, there are no predeﬁned I O stream objects for these types, as wcout is provided in correspondence to cout.  16.2.1 Using Locales  Using translations of textual messages is normally not sufﬁcient for true internationalization. For example, different conventions for numeric, monetary, or date formatting also have to be used.

SelectionofLocaleNames  addition, functions manipulating letters should depend on character encoding to ensure the correct handling of all characters that are letters in a given language.  According to the POSIX and X Open standards, it is already possible in C programs to set a locale by using the function setlocale  . Changing the locale inﬂuences the results of character classiﬁcation and manipulation functions, such as isupper   and toupper  , and the I O func- tions, such as printf  .  However, the C approach has several limitations. Because the locale is a global property, using more than one locale at the same time — for example, when reading ﬂoating-point numbers in English and writing them in German — is either not possible or is possible only with a relatively large effort. Also, locales cannot be extended. They provide only the facilities the implementation chooses to provide. If something the C locales do not provide must also be adapted to national conventions, a different mechanism has to be used to do this. Finally, it is not possible to deﬁne new locales to support special cultural conventions.  The C++ standard library addresses all these problems with an object-oriented approach. First, the details of a locale are encapsulated in an object of type locale. Doing this immediately provides the possibility of using multiple locales at the same time. Operations that depend on locales are   860  Chapter 16: Internationalization  conﬁgured to use a corresponding locale object. For example, a locale object can be installed for each I O stream, which is then used by the different member functions to adapt to the corresponding conventions. This is demonstrated by the following example:     i18n loc1.cpp  include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {  try {     use classic C locale to read data from standard input cin.imbue locale::classic   ;     use a German locale to write data to standard output    - use different locale names for Windows and POSIX  ifdef _MSC_VER  cout.imbue locale "deu_deu.1252"  ;  else  endif  cout.imbue locale "de_DE"  ;     read and output ﬂoating-point values in a loop cout << "input floating-point values  classic notation : " << endl; double value; while  cin >> value  {  cout << value << endl;  }  } catch  const std::exception& e  {  cerr << "Exception: " << e.what   << endl; return EXIT_FAILURE;  }  }  The ﬁrst imbue   statement assigns the “classic” C locale to the standard input channel:  cin.imbue locale::classic   ;     use classic C locale  For the classic C locale, formatting of numbers and dates, character classiﬁcation, and so on, is handled as it is in original C without any locales. The following expression obtains a corresponding object of class locale:   16.2 The Concept of Locales  861  Using the following expression instead would yield the same result:  std::locale::classic    std::locale "C"   This last expression constructs a locale object from a given name. The name "C" is a special name and is the only one a C++ implementation is required to support. There is no requirement to support any other locale, although it is assumed that C++ implementations also support other locales.  Alternatively, you could use the default constructor of class locale, which initializes a locale according to the current global locale of the program, which by default is also the “classic” C locale:  cin.imbue locale   ;     use global locale  classic C locale by default   Or you could use an empty string as locale name, which means that the “native” locale according to the environment of the program is used:  cin.imbue locale ""  ;     use native locale according to the environment  The next imbue   statements assign a German locale to the standard output channel using de_DE in a POSIX and deu_deu.1252 in a Windows environment:4  ifdef _MSC_VER  cout.imbue locale "deu_deu.1252"  ;  cout.imbue locale "de_DE"  ;  else  endif  47.11  47,11  This is, of course, successful only if the system supports this locale. If the name used to construct a locale object is unknown to the implementation, an exception of type runtime_error is thrown. For this reason, this call is surrounded by a try-catch clause.  If everything was successful, input is read according to the classic C conventions, and output is written according to the German conventions. The loop thus reads ﬂoating-point values in the classic English format:  and prints them using the German format:   Yes, the Germans really use a comma as a “decimal point.”   Normally, a program does not predeﬁne a speciﬁc locale except when writing and reading data in a ﬁxed format. Instead, the locale is determined using the environment variable LANG. Another possibility is to read the name of the locale to be used. The following program demonstrates this:     i18n loc2.cpp  include   include   include    4 “de” and “deu” stand for “Deutschland,” the German name of Germany.   862  Chapter 16: Internationalization  include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {  try {     create the default locale from the user’s environment locale langLocale "" ;     and assign it to the standard output channel cout.imbue langLocale ;     process the name of the locale to ﬁnd out whether German is used cout << langLocale.name   << endl; bool isGerman =  langLocale.name  .substr 0,2  == "de"   langLocale.name  .substr 0,3  == "ger"  langLocale.name  .substr 0,3  == "Ger" ;     read locale for the input cout <<  isGerman ? "Sprachumgebung fuer Eingaben: "  : "Locale for input: "  << endl;  string s; cin >> s; if  !cin  {  if  isGerman  {  << endl;  } else {  } return EXIT_FAILURE;  } locale cinLocale s ;  cerr << "FEHLER beim Einlesen der Sprachumgebung"  cerr << "ERROR while reading the locale" << endl;     create locale by string  since C++11      and assign it to the standard input channel cin.imbue cinLocale ;     read and output ﬂoating-point values in a loop cout <<  isGerman ? "Gleitkommawerte: "  double value;  : "Floating-point values: "  << endl;   16.2 The Concept of Locales  863  while  cin >> value  {  cout << value << endl;  }  } catch  const std::exception& e  {  cerr << "Exception: " << e.what   << endl; return EXIT_FAILURE;  }  }  In this example, the following statement creates an object of the class locale:  locale langLocale "" ;  Passing an empty string as the name of the locale has a special meaning: The “native” locale from the user’s environment is used, which is often determined by the environment variable LANG. This locale is assigned to the standard input stream with the statement  cout.imbue langLocale ;  The following expression is used to retrieve the name of the default locale, which is returned as an object of type string  see Chapter 13 :  The following statements construct a locale from a name read from standard input:  langLocale.name    string s; cin >> s; ... locale cinLocale s ;     create locale by string  since C++11   To do this, a word is read from the standard input and used as the constructor’s argument. Note that before C++11, the locale constructor accepted only type const char*, so before C++11, you had to write:  locale cinLocale s.c_str   ;     create locale by string before C++11  If the read fails, the ios_base::failbit is set in the input stream, which is checked and handled in this program:  if  !cin  {  if  isGerman  {  << endl;  } else {  } return EXIT_FAILURE;  }  cerr << "FEHLER beim Einlesen der Sprachumgebung"  cerr << "ERROR while reading the locale" << endl;   864  Chapter 16: Internationalization  Again, if the string is not a valid value for the construction of a locale, a runtime_error exception is thrown.  If a program wants to honor local conventions, it should use corresponding locale objects. The static member function global   of the class std::locale can be used to install a global locale object. This object is used as the default value for functions that take an optional locale object as an argument. If the locale object set with the global   function has a name, the C functions dealing with locales react correspondingly. If the locale set has no name, the consequences for the C functions depend on the implementation.  Here is an example of how to set the global locale object depending on the environment in which  the program is running:     create a locale object depending on the program’s environment and    set it as the global object std::locale::global std::locale ""  ;  Among other things, this arranges for the corresponding registration for the C functions to be exe- cuted. That is, the C functions are inﬂuenced as if the following call were made:  std::setlocale LC_ALL,""   However, setting the global locale does not replace locales already stored in objects. It modiﬁes the locale object copied only when a locale is created with a default constructor. For example, the stream objects store locale objects that are not replaced by a call to locale::global  . If you want an existing stream to use a speciﬁc locale, you have to tell the stream to use this locale by using the imbue   function.  The global locale is used if a locale object is created with the default constructor. In this case, the new locale behaves as if it is a copy of the global locale at the time it was constructed. The following three lines install the default locale for the standard streams:     register global locale object for streams std::cin.imbue std::locale   ; std::cout.imbue std::locale   ; std::cerr.imbue std::locale   ;  When using locales in C++, it is important to remember that the C++ locale mechanism is coupled only loosely to the C locale mechanism. There is only one relation to the C locale mechanism: The global C locale is modiﬁed if a named C++ locale object is set as the global locale. In general, you should not assume that the C and the C++ functions operate on the same locales.  16.2.2 Locale Facets  The dependencies on national conventions are separated into several aspects that are handled by corresponding objects. An object dealing with a speciﬁc aspect of internationalization is called a facet. A locale object is used as a container of different facets. To access an aspect of a locale, the type of the corresponding facet is used as the index. The type of the facet is passed explicitly as a template argument to the function template use_facet  , accessing the desired facet. For example, the following expression accesses the facet type numpunct  specialized for the character type char of the locale object loc:  std::use_facet > loc    16.2 The Concept of Locales  865  Each facet type is deﬁned by a class that deﬁnes certain services. For example, the facet type numpunct  provides services used with the formatting of numeric and Boolean values. For exam- ple, the following expression returns the string used to represent true in the locale loc:  std::use_facet > loc .truename    Note that use_facet   returns a reference to an object that is valid only as long as the locale object exists. Thus, the following statements result in undeﬁned behavior because fac is no longer valid after the ﬁrst expression:  const numpunct & fac = use_facet > locale "de"  ; cout << "true in German: " << fac.truename   << endl;     ERROR  Table 16.3 provides an overview of the facets predeﬁned by the C++ standard library. Each facet is associated with a category. These categories are used by some of the constructors of locales to create new locales as the combination of other locales.  Category numeric  monetary  time  ctype  collate messages  Facet Type num_get    num_put    numpunct    money_get    money_put    moneypunct    time_get    time_put    ctype    codecvt    collate    messages     Used for Numeric input Numeric output Symbols used for numeric I O Monetary input Monetary output Symbols used for monetary I O Time and date input Time and date output Character information  toupper  , isupper    Conversion between different character encodings String collation Message string retrieval  Page 873 871 870 881 879 874 887 884 891 897 904 905  Table16.3. FacetTypesPredeﬁnedbytheC++StandardLibrary  You can deﬁne your own versions of the facets to create specialized locales. The following example demonstrates how to do so. It deﬁnes a facet using German representations of the Boolean values:  class germanBoolNames : public std::numpunct_byname  {  public:  protected:  }  }  germanBoolNames  const std::string& name   : std::numpunct_byname  name  {  virtual std::string do_truename    const {  return "wahr";   866  }  };  virtual std::string do_falsename    const {  return "falsch";  Chapter 16: Internationalization  Note that before C++11, the constructor had to declare name with type const char*.  The class germanBoolNames derives from the class numpunct_byname , which is deﬁned by the C++ standard library. This class deﬁnes punctuation properties depending on the locale used for numeric formatting. Deriving from numpunct_byname  instead of from numpunct  lets you customize the members not overridden explicitly. The values returned from these members still depend on the name used as the argument to the constructor. If the class numpunct  had been used as the base class, the behavior of the other functions would be ﬁxed. However, the class germanBoolNames overrides the two functions used to determine the textual representation of true and false.  To use this facet in a locale, you need to create a new locale, using a special constructor of the class std::locale. This constructor takes a locale object as its ﬁrst argument and a pointer to a facet as its second argument. The created locale is identical to the ﬁrst argument except for the facet that is passed as the second argument. This facet is installed in the newly created locale after the ﬁrst argument is copied:  std::locale loc  std::locale "" , new germanBoolNames ""  ;  The new expression creates a facet that is installed in the new locale. Thus, it is registered in loc to create a variation of locale "" . Since locales are immutable, you have to create a new locale object if you want to install a new facet to a locale. This locale object can be used like any other locale object. For example,  std::cout.imbue loc ; std::cout << std::boolalpha << true << std::endl;  would have the following output  see i18n germanbool.cpp for the complete example :  wahr  You also can create a completely new facet. In this case, the function has_facet   can be used to determine whether such a new facet is registered for a given locale object.  16.3 Locales in Detail  A C++ locale is an immutable container for facets. It is deﬁned in the   header ﬁle.  The strange thing about locales is how the objects stored in the container are accessed. A facet in a locale is accessed using the type of the facet as the index. Because each facet exposes a different interface and suits a different purpose, it is desirable to have the access function to locales return a type corresponding to the index. This is exactly what can be done with a type as the index. Using the facet’s type as an index has the additional advantage of having a type-safe interface.  Locales are immutable. This means the facets stored in a locale cannot be changed except when locales are being assigned. Variations of locales are created by combining existing locales and facets to create a new locale. Table 16.4 lists the constructors for locales.   16.3 Locales in Detail  867  Expression locale   locale ""  locale name  locale loc  locale loc1,loc2,cat   locale loc,name,cat  locale loc,fp   Effect Default constructor; creates a copy of the current global locale Creates a “native” locale according to the environment Creates a locale from the string name Copy constructor; creates a copy of locale loc Creates a copy of locale loc1, with all facets from category cat replaced with facets from locale loc2 Equivalent to locale loc,locale name ,cat  Creates a copy of locale loc and installs the facet to which fp refers  loc1.combine  loc2  Creates and yields a copy of locale loc1 but with the facet of type  loc1 = loc2  F taken from loc2 Assigns locale loc2 to locale loc1  Table16.4. ConstructingandAssigningLocales  Almost all constructors create a copy of another locale. Merely copying a locale is considered to be a cheap operation, consisting of setting a pointer and increasing a reference count. Creating a modiﬁed locale is more expensive, because a reference count for each facet stored in the locale has to be adjusted. Although the standard makes no guarantees about such efﬁcient behavior, it is likely that all implementations will be rather efﬁcient for copying locales.  Two of the constructors listed in Table 16.4 take names of locales. The names accepted are not standardized, with the exception of the name C  see Section 16.2, page 857 . Before C++11, name had to be a C-string.  The member function combine   needs some explanation because it uses a feature that is rarely used. It is a member function template with an explicitly speciﬁed template argument. This means that the template argument is not deduced implicitly from an argument, because there is no argument from which the type can be deduced. Instead, the template argument is speciﬁed explicitly  facet type F in this case .  The two functions that access facets in a locale object use the same technique  Table 16.5 . The  major difference is that these two functions are global function templates.  Expression has_facet  loc  Returns true if a facet of type F is stored in locale loc use_facet  loc  Returns a reference to the facet of type F stored in locale loc  Effect  Table16.5. AccessingFacets  The function use_facet   returns a reference to a facet. The type of this reference is the type passed explicitly as the template argument. If the locale passed as the argument does not contain a corresponding facet, the function throws a bad_cast exception. The function has_facet   can be used to test whether a particular facet is present in a given locale.   868  Chapter 16: Internationalization  The remaining operations of locales are listed in Table 16.6.  Expression loc.name   loc1 == loc2 loc1 != loc2 loc str1,str2   locale::classic   locale::global loc   Effect Returns the name of locale loc as string Returns true if loc1 and loc2 are identical locales Returns true if loc1 and loc2 are different locales Returns the Boolean result of comparing strings str1 and str2 for ordering  whether str1 is less than str2  Returns locale "C"  Installs loc as the global locale and returns the previous global locale  Table16.6. OperationsofLocales  The name of a locale is maintained if the locale was constructed from a name or one or more named locales. If a locale has no name, name   returns the string "*". Again, the standard makes no guarantees about the construction of a name resulting from combining two locales. Two locales are considered to be identical if one is a copy of the other or if both locales have the same name. It is natural to consider two objects to be identical if one is a copy of the other. But what about the naming? The idea behind this is that the name of the locale reﬂects the names used to construct the named facets. For example, the locale’s name might be constructed by joining the names of the facets in a particular order, separating the individual names by separation characters. Using this scheme, it would possible to identify two locale objects as identical if they are constructed by combining the same named facets into locale objects. In other words, the standard requires that two locales consisting of the same set of named facets be considered identical. Thus, the names will probably be constructed carefully to support this notion of equality.  The parentheses operator makes it possible to use a locale object as a comparator for strings. This operator uses the string comparison from the collate  facet  see Section 16.4.5, page 904  to compare the strings passed as the argument for ordering. It returns true if str1 is less than str2 according to the local object. Thus, the locale object can be used as an STL function object  see Section 10.1, page 475  comparing strings. In fact, you can use a locale object as a sorting criterion for STL algorithms that operate on strings. For example, a vector of strings can be sorted according to the rules for string collation of the German locale as follows:  std::vector  v; ...    sort strings according to the German locale std::sort  v.begin  ,v.end  ,  locale "de_DE"  ;     range    sorting criterion   16.4 Facets in Detail  869  16.4 Facets in Detail  The contained facets are the important aspect of locales. All locales are guaranteed to contain certain standard facets. The description of the individual facets in the following subsections explains which instantiations of the corresponding facet are guaranteed. In addition to these facets, an implementa- tion of the C++ standard library may provide additional facets in the locales. What is important is that users can also install their own facets or replace standard ones.  Section 16.2.2, page 864, discussed how to install a facet in a locale. For example, the class germanBoolNames was derived from the class numpunct_byname , one of the standard facets, and installed in a locale using the constructor, taking a locale and a facet as arguments. But what do you need to create your own facet? Every class F that conforms to the following two requirements can be used as a facet: 1. F derives publicly from class std::locale::facet. This base class mainly deﬁnes some mech- anism for reference counting that is used internally by the locale objects. It also deletes the copy constructor and the assignment operator, thereby making it unfeasible to copy or to assign facets. 2. F has a publicly accessible static member named id of type locale::id. This member is used to look up a facet in a locale by using the facet’s type. The whole issue of using a type as the index is to have a type-safe interface. Internally, a normal container with an integer as the index is used to maintain the facets.  The standard facets conform not only to these requirements but also to two special implementa- tion guidelines. Although conforming to these guidelines is not required, doing so is useful. The guidelines are as follows: 1. All member functions are declared to be const. This is useful because use_facet   returns a reference to a constant facet. Member functions that are not declared to be const can’t be invoked.  2. All public functions are nonvirtual and delegate each request to a protected virtual function. The protected function is named like the public one, with the addition of a leading do_. For example, numpunct::truename   calls numpunct::do_truename  . This style is used to avoid hiding member functions when overriding only one of several virtual member functions that has the same name. For example, the class num_put has several functions named put  . In addition, it gives the programmer of the base class the possibility of adding some extra code in the nonvirtual functions, which is executed even if the virtual function is overridden.  The following description of the standard facets concerns only the public functions. To modify the facet, you always have to override the corresponding protected functions. If you deﬁne functions with the same interface as the public facet functions, they would overload them only because these functions are not virtual.  For most standard facets, a “_byname” version is deﬁned. This version derives from the standard facet and is used to create an instantiation for a corresponding locale name. For example, the class numpunct_byname is used to create the numpunct facet for a named locale. For example, a German numpunct facet can be created like this: std::numpunct_byname "de_DE"    870  Chapter 16: Internationalization  The _byname classes are used internally by the locale constructors that take a name as an argument. For each of the standard facets supporting a name, the corresponding _byname class is used to construct an instance of the facet.  16.4.1 Numeric Formatting  Numeric formatting converts between the internal representation of numbers and the correspond- ing textual representations. The iostream operators delegate the conversion to the facets of the locale::numeric category. This category is formed by three facets: 1. numpunct, which handles punctuation symbols used for numeric formatting and parsing 2. num_put, which handles numeric formatting 3. num_get, which handles numeric parsing In short, the facet num_put does the numeric formatting described for iostreams in Section 15.7, page 779, and num_get parses the corresponding strings. Additional ﬂexibility not directly accessi- ble through the interface of the streams is provided by the numpunct facet.  Numeric Punctuation  The numpunct  facet controls the symbol used as the decimal point, the insertion of optional thou- sands separators, and the strings used for the textual representation of Boolean values. Table 16.7 lists the members of numpunct .  Meaning  Expression np.decimal_point   Returns the character used as the decimal point np.thousands_sep   Returns the character used as the thousands separator np.grouping   np.truename   np.falsename    Returns a string describing the positions of the thousands separators Returns the textual representation of true Returns the textual representation of false  Table16.7. Membersofthe numpunct  Facet  The numpunct  facet takes a character type charT as the template argument. The char- acters returned from decimal_point   and thousand_sep   are of this type, and the func- tions truename   and falsename   return a basic_string . The two instantiations numpunct  and numpunct  are required.  Because long numbers are hard to read without intervening characters, the standard facets for numeric formatting and numeric parsing support thousands separators. Often, the digits representing an integer are grouped into triples. For example, one million is written like this:  Unfortunately, it is not used everywhere exactly like that. For example, a period is used instead of a comma in German. Thus, a German would write one million like this:  1,000,000  1.000.000   16.4 Facets in Detail  871  This difference is covered by the thousands_sep   member. But this is not sufﬁcient, because in some countries, digits are not put into triples. For example, people in Nepal would write  10.00.000  using even different numbers of digits in the groups. This is where the string returned from the function grouping   comes in. The number stored at index i gives the number of digits in the ith group, where counting starts with zero for the rightmost group. If there are fewer characters in the string than groups, the size of the last speciﬁed group is repeated. To create unlimited groups, you can use the value numeric_limits ::max   or if there is no group at all, the empty string. Table 16.8 lists some examples of the formatting of one million. Note that the string is interpreted as a sequence of integral values. Thus, normal digits are usually not useful  for example, the string "2" would usually specify groups of 50 digits because the character ’2’ has the integer value 50 in the ASCII character set .  Value { 0 } { 3, 0 } { 3, 2, 3, 0 } { 2, CHAR_MAX, 0 }  As String Result "" "\3" "\3\2\3" n.a.  1000000  default  1,000,000 10,00,000 10000,00  Table16.8. ExamplesofNumericPunctuationofOneMillion  Note that decimal_point   and thousands_sep   might return ’0’ to sign no  special  de-  ﬁned character.  Numeric Formatting  The num_put  facet is used for textual formatting of numbers. It is a class template that takes two template arguments: the type charT of the characters to be produced and the type OutIt of an output iterator to the location at which the produced characters are written. The output iterator defaults to ostreambuf_iterator . The num_put facet provides an overloaded set of functions, all called put   and differing only in the last argument, which speciﬁes the value to format  see Table 16.9 .  Expression np.put to,fs,ﬁll,val  Writes val to to, using the format in fs and the ﬁll character ﬁll  Meaning  Table16.9. Membersofthe num_put  Facet  The arguments put   processes are as follows:   to is the output iterator the time is written to. put   returns a copy of this iterator with the position immediately after the last character written. Here, you can also pass a stream, which will be converted into a stream iterator.   fs is a stream object of type std::ios_base that deﬁnes the formatting. It is usually a stream,  imbued by the required locale and facets.   872  Chapter 16: Internationalization    ﬁll is a character to use in case a ﬁlling character is needed.   val is the value to format, overloaded for types bool, long, long long, unsigned long,  unsigned long long, double, long double, and const void*.  The following program demonstrates how to use this facet:     i18n numput.cpp  include   include   include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main    {  try {     print ﬂoating-point value with the global classic locale: locale locC; cout.imbue locC ; use_facet > locC .put  cout, cout, ’ ’,  1234.5678 ;  cout << endl;     print ﬂoating-point value with German locale:  ifdef _MSC_VER  locale locG "deu_deu.1252" ;  else  endif  locale locG "de_DE" ;  cout.imbue locG ; use_facet > locG .put  cout, cout, ’ ’,  1234.5678 ;  cout << endl;  } catch  const std::exception& e  {  cerr << "Exception: " << e.what   << endl; return EXIT_FAILURE;  }  }  As you can see, you can simply pass the output stream with the corresponding locale and facets used for formatting as ﬁrst two arguments:   16.4 Facets in Detail  873  locale locC; cout.imbue locC ; use_facet > locC .put  cout, cout, ’ ’,  1234.5678 ;  On my machine, the program has the following output:  1234.57 1.234,57  As you can see, the put   statement produces different textual representations of the passed numeric value. In fact, with the German locale, the decimal point becomes ’,’ and the thousands separator becomes ’.’ used after each group of three digits.  The standard requires that the two instantiations num_put  and num_put  be stored in each locale. In addition, the C++ standard library supports all instantiations that take a character type as the ﬁrst template argument and an output iterator type as the second.  Numeric Parsing  The num_get  facet is used to parse textual representations of numbers. Corresponding to the facet num_put, it is a template that takes two template arguments: the character type charT and an input iterator type InIt, which defaults to istreambuf_iterator . It provides a set of overloaded get   functions that differ only in the last argument. The num_get  facet provides an set of overloaded get   functions, differing only in the last argument, which speciﬁes the type of the value to parse  see Table 16.10 .  Expression ng.get beg,end,fs,err,valRet   Meaning Parses the character sequence [beg,end  according to the format in fs and the type of valRet  Table16.10. Membersofthe num_get  Facet  You can use the facet as follows  see i18n numget.cpp for the complete example : std::locale InIt InIt std::ios_base& fs std::ios_base::iostate err; T     locale    beginning of input sequence    end of input sequence    stream that deﬁnes input format    state after call    value after successful call  loc; beg = ...; end = ...; = ...;  val;     get numeric input facet of the loc locale const std::num_get & ng  = std::use_facet > loc ;     read value with numeric input facet ng.get  beg, end, fs, err, val ;   874  Chapter 16: Internationalization  These statements attempt to parse a numeric value corresponding to the type T from the sequence of characters between beg and end. The format of the expected numeric value is deﬁned by the argu- ment fs. If the parsing fails, err is modiﬁed to contain the value ios_base::failbit. Otherwise, ios_base::goodbit is stored in err and the parsed value in val. The value of val is modiﬁed only if the parsing is successful. get   returns the second parameter  end  if the sequence was used completely. Otherwise, it returns an iterator pointing to the ﬁrst character that could not be parsed as part of the numeric value.  The num_get  facet supports functions to read objects of the types bool, long, unsigned short, unsigned int, unsigned long, float, double, long double, and void*. There are some types for which there is no corresponding function in the num_put facet; for example, unsigned short. The reason is that writing a value of type unsigned short produces the same result as writing a value of type unsigned short promoted to an unsigned long. However, read- ing a value as type unsigned long and then converting it to unsigned short may yield a value different from reading it as type unsigned short directly.  The standard requires that the two instantiations num_get  and num_get  be stored in each locale. In addition, the C++ standard library supports all instantiations that take a character type as the ﬁrst template argument and an input iterator type as the second.  16.4.2 Monetary Formatting  The category monetary consists of the facets moneypunct, money_get, and money_put. The moneypunct  facet deﬁnes the format of monetary values. The other two facets use this informa- tion to format or to parse a monetary value.  Monetary Punctuation  How monetary values are printed depends on the context. The formats used in various cultural communities differ widely. Examples of the varying details are the placement of the currency symbol  if present at all , the notation for negative or positive values, the use of national or international currency symbols, and the use of thousands separators. To provide the necessary ﬂexibility, the details of the format are factored into the facet moneypunct.  The moneypunct  facet is a class template that takes as arguments a character type charT and a Boolean value that defaults to false. The Boolean value indicates whether local  false  or international  true  currency symbols are to be used. Table 16.11 lists the members of the facet moneypunct .  The following program demonstrates how these values might differ for various locales:     i18n moneypunct.cpp  include   include   include   include   include     16.4 Facets in Detail  875  Meaning  Expression mp.decimal_point   Returns a character to be used as the decimal point mp.thousands_sep   Returns a character to be used as the thousands separator mp.grouping   mp.curr_symbol   mp.positive_sign   Returns a string with the positive sign mp.negative_sign   Returns a string with the negative sign Returns the number of fractional digits mp.frac_digits   Returns the format to be used for non-negative values mp.pos_format   Returns the format to be used for negative values mp.neg_format    Returns a string specifying the placement of the thousands separators Returns a string with the currency symbol  Table16.11.

Note also that the German format differs in a way that the euro symbol is placed after the value, whereas EUR is placed before the value with no space. See page 880 for an application of these formats.  Monetary Punctuation in Detail  The moneypunct  facet derives from the class money_base:  namespace std {  class money_base {  public:  enum part { none, space, symbol, sign, value }; struct pattern {  char field[4];  };  }  };  Type pattern is used to store four values of type part that form a pattern describing the layout of a monetary value. Table 16.12 lists the ﬁve possible parts that can be placed in a pattern.  The moneypunct  facet deﬁnes two functions that return patterns: the function neg_format   for negative values and the function pos_format   for non-negative values. In a pattern, each of the parts sign, symbol, and value is mandatory, and one of the parts none and space has to appear. This does not mean, however, that a sign or a currency symbol is printed. What is printed at the positions indicated by the parts depends on the values returned from other members of the facet and on the formatting ﬂags passed to the functions for formatting.   878  Chapter 16: Internationalization  Meaning At this position, spaces may appear but are not required. At this position, at least one space is required. At this position, a sign may appear.  Value none space sign symbol At this position, the currency symbol may appear. value  At this position, the value appears.  Table16.12. PartsofMonetaryLayoutPatterns  Only the value always appears. It is placed at the position where the part value is located in the pattern. The value has exactly frac_digits   fractional digits, with decimal_point   used as the decimal point unless there are no fractional digits, in which case no decimal point is used.  When reading monetary values, thousands separators are allowed but not required in the input. When present, they are checked for correct placements according to grouping  . If grouping   is empty, no thousands separators are allowed. The character used for the thousands separator is the one returned from thousands_sep  . The rules for the placement of the thousands separators are identical to the rules for numeric formatting  see Section 16.4.1, page 870 . When monetary values are printed, thousands separators are always inserted according to the string returned from grouping  . When monetary values are read, thousands separators are optional unless the grouping string is empty. The correct placement of thousands separators is checked after all other parsing is successful.  Note that decimal_point   and thousand_sep   might return ’\0’ to signal no  special   deﬁned character.  The parts space and none control the placement of spaces. The part space is used at a position where at least one space is required. During formatting, if ios_base::internal is speciﬁed in the format ﬂags, ﬁll characters are inserted at the position of the space or the none part. Of course, ﬁlling is done only if the minimum width speciﬁed is not used with other characters. The character used as the space character is passed as the argument to the functions for the formatting of monetary values. If the formatted value does not contain a space, none can be placed at the last position. The parts space and none may not appear as the ﬁrst part in a pattern, and space may not be the last part in a pattern.  Signs for monetary values may consist of more than one character. For example, in certain contexts, parentheses around a value are used to indicate negative values. At the position where the sign part appears in the pattern, the ﬁrst character of the sign appears. All other characters of the sign appear at the end after all other components. If the string for a sign is empty, no character indicating the sign appears. The character that is to be used as a sign is determined with the function positive_sign   for non-negative values and negative_sign   for negative values.  At the position of the symbol part, the currency symbol appears. The symbol is present only if the formatting ﬂags used during formatting or parsing have the ios_base::showbase ﬂag set. The string returned from the function curr_symbol   is used as the currency symbol, which is a local symbol to be used to indicate the currency if the second template argument is false  the In this example for the German default . Otherwise, an international currency symbol is used.   16.4 Facets in Detail  879  locale, the international symbol EUR is used. With the second template argument to moneypunct  being false, the euro symbol would be used instead.  Table 16.13 illustrates all this, using the value $-1234.56 as an example. Of course, this means  that the showbase ﬂag is set, frac_digits   returns 2, and a width of 0 is always used.

ExamplesofUsingtheMonetaryPattern  The standard requires that the instantiations moneypunct , moneypunct ,  moneypunct , and moneypunct  be stored in each locale.  Monetary Formatting  The money_put  facet is used to format monetary values. It is a template that takes a character type charT as the ﬁrst template argument and an output iterator OutIt as the second. The output iterator defaults to ostreambuf_iterator . The overloaded member function put   produces a sequence of characters corresponding to the speciﬁed format  see Table 16.14 .  Expression tp.put to,intl,fs,ﬁll,valAsDouble  Converts the monetary value passed as long double tp.put to,intl,fs,ﬁll,valAsString   Converts the monetary value passed as string  Meaning  Table16.14. Membersofthe money_put  Facet  As you can see, both put   members of the money_put  facet use the following arguments:   to is the output iterator to which the monetary value is written. put   returns a copy of this iterator with the position immediately after the last character written. Here, you can also pass a stream, which will be converted into a stream iterator.   intl is a Boolean value specifying whether the international currency symbol shall be used. Thus,   fs is a stream object of type std::ios_base that deﬁnes the formatting. It is usually a stream, imbued by the required locale, facets, and formatting state, such as the ﬁeld width and showbase to force the currency symbol.  it speciﬁes the second template parameter of the moneypunct facet that is used.   880  Chapter 16: Internationalization    ﬁll is a character to use in case a ﬁlling character is needed.   The last argument speciﬁes the value that is formatted. You can either pass it as long double or as std::string. If the argument is a string, this string may consist only of decimal digits with an optional leading minus sign. If the ﬁrst character of the string is a minus sign, the value is formatted as a negative value. After it is determined that the value is negative, the minus sign is discarded. The number of fractional digits in the string is determined from the member function frac_digits   of the moneypunct facet.  The following program demonstrates how to use the money_put  facet:     i18n moneyput.cpp  include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main    {  try {     use German locale:  ifdef _MSC_VER  locale locG "deu_deu.1252" ;  else  endif  locale locG "de_DE" ;  const money_put & mpG = use_facet  > locG ;     ensure that the money_put  facet impacts the output and currency is written: cout.imbue locG ; cout << showbase;     use double as monetary value  use local symbol  mpG.put  cout, false, cout, ’ ’, 12345.678 ; cout << endl;     use string as monetary value  use international symbol  mpG.put  cout, true, cout, ’ ’, "12345.678" ; cout << endl;  } catch  const std::exception& e  {  cerr << "EXCEPTION: " << e.what   << endl; return EXIT_FAILURE;  }  }   16.4 Facets in Detail  881  The program has the following output:  123,46 e EUR123,45  According to the format of the moneypunct facet for a German locale on my machine  see page 876 , the ﬁrst output format is “sign value space symbol,” using the euro currency symbol. If the interna- tional currency symbol shall be used, it is “symbol sign none value,” which means that there is no space between the currency symbol and the value.  Note that the unit used for the passed monetary value passed to put   is Cent in the United States or Eurocent in Europe. When passing a long double the fractional part of the value is rounded. When passing a string it is truncated.  The standard requires that the two instantiations money_put  and money_put  be stored in each locale. In addition, the C++ standard library supports all instantiations that take char or wchar_t as the ﬁrst template argument and a corresponding output iterator as the second.  Monetary Parsing  The money_get  facet is used for parsing monetary values. It is a class template that takes a character type charT as the ﬁrst template argument and an input iterator type InIt as the second. The second template argument defaults to istreambuf_iterator . This class deﬁnes two member functions called get   that try to parse a character sequence and, if the parse is suc- cessful, store the result in a value of type long double or of type basic_string   see Table 16.15 .  Expression mg.get beg,end,intl,fs,err,  valAsDoubleRet   mg.get beg,end,intl,fs,err,  valAsStringRet   Meaning Parses the character sequence [beg,end  according to intl and the format in fs into the long double valAsDoubleRet Parses the character sequence [beg,end  according to intl and the format in fs into the string valAsStringRet  Table16.15. Membersofthe money_get  Facet  The character sequence to be parsed is deﬁned by the sequence between beg and end. The parsing stops as soon as either all elements of the used pattern are read or an error is encountered. If an error is encountered, the ios_base::failbit is set in err, and nothing is stored in valAsDoubleRet or valAsStringRet. If parsing is successful, the result is stored in the value of type long double or basic_string  that is passed by reference as the last argument. Note that a monetary value such as $1234.56 would yield 123456 as long double and "123456" as string. Thus, the unit is Cent in the United States or Eurocent in Europe.  The argument intl is a Boolean value that selects a local or an international currency string. The moneypunct  facet deﬁning the format of the value to be parsed is retrieved using the locale object imbued by the argument fs. For parsing a monetary value, the pattern returned from the member neg_format   of the moneypunct  facet is always used. At the position of none or space, the   Chapter 16: Internationalization  function that is parsing a monetary value consumes all available space, unless none is the last part in a pattern. Trailing spaces are not skipped.  The get   functions return an iterator that points to immediately after the last character con-  882  sumed.  You can use the facet as follows:    get monetary input facet of the loc locale const std::money_get & mg  = std::use_facet > loc ;     read value with monetary input facet long double val; mg.get  beg, end, intl, fs, err, val ;  The standard requires that the two instantiations money_get  and money_get  be stored in each locale. In addition, the C++ standard library supports all instantiations that take char or wchar_t as the ﬁrst template argument and a corresponding input iterator as the second.  Using Monetary Manipulators  Since C++11, you can use manipulators, deﬁned in  , to read and write monetary values directly from or to a stream. These are presented in Table 16.16.  Manipulator put_money val   put_money val,intl   get_money valRef   Effect Writes a monetary value val, using the local currency symbol  calls put strmBeg,strmEnd,false,strm,strm.fill  ,val  for the facet  Writes a monetary value val, using the currency symbol according to intl  calls put strmBeg,strmEnd,intl,strm,strm.fill  ,val  for the facet  Reads a monetary value into valRef, using the local currency symbol  calls get strmBeg,strmEnd,false,strm,err,val  for the facet   get_money valRef,intl  Reads a monetary value into valRef, using the currency symbol  according to intl  calls get strmBeg,strmEnd,intl,strm,err,val  for the facet   Table16.16. ManipulatorsforMonetaryFormatting  Again, the values can be  references to  long doubles or strings, and intl deﬁnes whether to use a local or international currency symbol, passed as second template argument to the moneypunct facet.   16.4 Facets in Detail  883  The following program demonstrates how to use these manipulators:     i18n moneymanipulator.cpp  include   include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main    {  try {     use German locale:  ifdef _MSC_VER  locale locG "deu_deu.1252" ;  else  endif  locale locG "de_DE" ;     use German locale and ensure that the currency is written: cin.imbue locG ; cout.imbue locG ; cout << showbase;     read monetary value into long double  use international symbol  long double val; cout << "monetary value: "; cin >> get_money val,true ;  if  cin  {  } else {  }     write monetary value  use local symbol  cout << put_money val,false  << endl;  cerr << "invalid format" << endl;  } catch  const std::exception& e  {  cerr << "Exception: " << e.what   << endl; return EXIT_FAILURE;  }  }   Chapter 16: Internationalization  884  If I input  EUR 1234,567  or just  1234,567  the output would be  1.234,56 e  16.4.3 Time and Date Formatting  The two facets time_get  and time_put  in the category time provide services for parsing and formatting of times and dates. This is done by the member functions that operate on objects of type tm. This type is deﬁned in the header ﬁle  . The objects are not passed directly; rather, a pointer to them is used as the argument.  Both facets in the time category depend heavily on the behavior of the function strftime  , also deﬁned in the header ﬁle  . This function uses a string with conversion speciﬁers to produce a string from a tm object. Table 16.17 provides a brief summary of the conversion speciﬁers. The same conversion speciﬁers are also used by the time_put facet.  Of course, the exact string produced by strftime   depends on the C locale in effect. The  examples in the table are given for the "C" locale.  Time and Date Formatting  The time_put  facet is used for formatting times and dates. It is a class template that takes as arguments a character type charT and an optional output iterator type OutIt. The latter defaults to type ostreambuf_iterator  see Section 15.13.2, page 828 .  The time_put  facet deﬁnes two functions called put  , which are used to convert the date information stored in an object of type tm into a sequence of characters written to an output iterator. Table 16.18 lists the members of the facet time_put . As you can see, all put   members of the time_put facet use the following ﬁrst four arguments:   to is the output iterator to which the time is written. put   returns a copy of this iterator with the position immediately after the last character written. Here, you can also pass a stream, which will be converted into a stream iterator.   fs is a stream object of type std::ios_base that deﬁnes the formatting. It is usually a stream,   ﬁll is a character to use in case a ﬁlling character is needed.   val is the time value of type tm* storing the date to be formatted. The ﬁrst form of put   uses cvt to pass one of the conversion speciﬁers to strftime  , listed in Table 16.17, to deﬁne the requested formatting.  imbued by the required locale and facets.  The second form of put   allows you to provide an optional modiﬁer. The meaning of the argument mod is not deﬁned by the standard. It is intended to be used as a modiﬁer to the conversion as found in several implementations of the strftime   function.   16.4 Facets in Detail  885  Speciﬁer Meaning %a %A %b %B %c %d %H %I %j %m %M %p %S %U %W %w %x %X %y %Y %Z %%  Abbreviated weekday Full weekday Abbreviated month name Full month name Locale’s preferred date and time representation Day of the month Hour of the day using a 24-hour clock Hour of the day using a 12-hour clock Day of the year Month as decimal number Minutes Morning or evening  AM or PM  Seconds Week number starting with the ﬁrst Sunday Week number starting with the ﬁrst Monday Weekday as a number  Sunday == 0  Locale’s preferred date representation Locale’s preferred time representation The year without the century The year with the century The time zone The literal %  Example Mon Monday Jul July Jul 12 21:53:22 1998 12 21 9 193 7 53 PM 22 28 28 0 Jul 12 1998 21:53:22 98 1998 MEST %  Table16.17.

Membersofthe time_put  Facet  The third form of put   uses the beginning and end of a character sequence [cbeg,cend  specify- ing the required format by using the conversion speciﬁers to strftime  . This character sequence guides the conversion very much like strftime  . It scans the string and writes every character that is not part of a conversion speciﬁcation to the output iterator to. If it encounters a conversion speciﬁcation introduced by the character %, it extracts an optional modiﬁer and the conversion spec- iﬁer and acts like the second form of put   for them. After that, put   continues to scan the string. Note that this form of put   is somewhat unusual because it does not call a corresponding virtual do_put   member function as introduced in Section 16.4, page 869. Instead, it calls the correspond-   886  Chapter 16: Internationalization  ing do_put   for the second form directly. Thus, the behavior of the third form can’t be overwritten when deriving from time_put.  The following program demonstrates this for the default and for a German locale:     i18n timeput.cpp  include   include   include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main    {  try {     query local time: auto now = chrono::system_clock::now  ; std::time_t t = chrono::system_clock::to_time_t now ; tm* nowTM = std::localtime &t ;     print local time with the global classic locale: locale locC; const time_put & tpC = use_facet > locC ;     use single conversion speciﬁer tpC.put  cout, cout, ’ ’, nowTM, ’x’ ; cout << endl;     use format string: string format = "%A %x %I%p\n"; tpC.put  cout, cout, ’ ’, nowTM,     format: weekday date hour  format.c_str  , format.c_str  +format.size    ;     print local time with German locale:  ifdef _MSC_VER  locale locG "deu_deu.1252" ;  else  endif  locale locG "de_DE" ;  const time_put & tpG = use_facet > locG ; tpG.put  cout, cout, ’ ’, nowTM, ’x’ ; cout << endl;   16.4 Facets in Detail  887  tpG.put  cout, cout, ’ ’, nowTM,  format.c_str  , format.c_str  +format.size    ;  } catch  const std::exception& e  {  cerr << "Exception: " << e.what   << endl; return EXIT_FAILURE;  }  }  First, we query the local time and convert it into a struct tm*, using the std::system_clock  see Section 5.7.3, page 149 .5 Next, we create two locales  a default classic locale and a German locale , create the time_put facets for them, and use these to output the current date and time.  The ﬁrst call of put   uses ’x’ as conversion speciﬁers to strftime  , which means that the  locale’s preferred date representation is used:  tpC.put  cout, cout, ’ ’, nowTM, ’x’ ;  The second call of put   calls its third form, which uses the begin and end of a character sequence specifying the output format “weekday date hour”:  string format = "%A %x %I%p\n"; tpC.put  cout, cout, ’ ’, nowTM,  format.c_str  , format.c_str  +format.size    ;  On my machine, the program had the following output:  09 13 11 Tuesday 09 13 11 03PM 13.09.2011 Dienstag 13.09.2011 03  As you can see by the last line, in German we have no corresponding AM or PM speciﬁer.  The standard requires that the two instantiations time_put  and time_put  be stored in each locale. In addition, the C++ standard library supports all instantiations that take char or wchar_t as the ﬁrst template argument and a corresponding output iterator as the second.  Time and Date Parsing  The time_get  facet is a class template that takes a character type charT and an input iterator type InIt as template arguments. The input iterator type defaults to istreambuf_iterator . Table 16.19 lists the members deﬁned for the time_get  facet. All these members, except date_order  , parse the string and store the results in the tm object pointed to by the argument t. If the string could not be parsed correctly, either an error is reported  for example, by modifying the argument err  or an unspeciﬁed value is stored. This means that a time produced by a program can  5 std::system_clock was introduced with C++11. Before C++11, you had to declare a std::time_t t and call std::time &t ;   888  Chapter 16: Internationalization  be parsed reliably, but user input cannot. With the argument fs, other facets used during parsing are determined. Whether other ﬂags from fs have any inﬂuence on the parsing is not speciﬁed.  Expression tg.get beg,end,fs,err,t,fmtChar   tg.get beg,end,fs,err,t,fmtChar,mod   tg.get beg,end,fs,err,t,fmtBeg,fmtEnd   tg.get_time beg,end,fs,err,t   tg.get_date beg,end,fs,err,t   tg.get_weekday beg,end,fs,err,t   tg.get_monthname beg,end,fs,err,t   tg.get_year beg,end,fs,err,t   tg.date_order    Meaning Parses the character sequence [beg,end  according to the conversion speciﬁer fmtChar  since C++11  Parses the character sequence [beg,end  according to the conversion speciﬁer fmtChar and the modiﬁer mod  since C++11  Parses the character sequence [beg,end  according to the character sequence [fmtBeg,fmtEnd,  since C++11  Parses the character sequence [beg,end  as the time produced by the X speciﬁer for strftime   Parses the character sequence [beg,end  as the date produced by the x speciﬁer for strftime   Parses the character sequence [beg,end  as the name of the weekday Parses the character sequence [beg,end  as the name of the month Parses the character sequence [beg,end  as the year Returns the date order used by the facet  Table16.19. Membersofthe time_get  Facet  All functions return an iterator that has the position immediately after the last character read. The parsing stops if parsing is complete or if an error occurs  for example, because a string could not be parsed as a date .  Note the following:  Available since C++11, get   reads the values according to the passed format, which is either a conversion character without the leading % plus optional modiﬁer or a format string, passed as beginning and end of a character sequence.   A function reading the name of a weekday or a month reads both abbreviated names and full names. If the abbreviation is followed by a letter, which would be legal for a full name, the function attempts to read the full name. If this fails, the parsing fails, even though an abbreviated name was already parsed successfully.   Whether a function that is parsing a year allows two-digit years is unspeciﬁed. The year that is  assumed for a two-digit year, if it is allowed, is also unspeciﬁed.   16.4 Facets in Detail  889    date_order   returns the order in which the day, month, and year appear in a date string. This is necessary for some dates because the order cannot be determined from the string representing a date. For example, the ﬁrst day in February in the year 2003 may be printed either as 3 2 1 or as 1 2 3. Class time_base, which is the base class of the facet time_get, deﬁnes an enumeration called dateorder for possible date-order values. Table 16.20 lists these values.  Meaning  Value no_order No particular order  for example, a date may be in Julian format  dmy mdy ymd ydm  The order is day, month, year The order is month, day, year The order is year, month, day The order is year, day, month  Table16.20. MembersoftheEnumeration dateorder  The following example demonstrates how to use the time_get  facet:     i18n timeget.cpp  include   include   include   include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main    {  try {     use German locale:  ifdef _MSC_VER  locale locG "deu_deu.1252" ;  locale locG "de_DE.ISO-8859-1" ;  else  endif  const time_get & tgG = use_facet > locG ;     print date order of German locale: typedef time_base TB; time_get ::dateorder d = tgG.date_order  ; cout << "dateorder: "  <<  d==TB::no_orderd==TB::mdy ?

If I input Tuesday 17:30 or Dienstag  The standard requires that the two instantiations time_get  and time_get  are stored in each locale. In addition, the C++ standard library supports all instantiations that take char or wchar_t as the ﬁrst template argument and a corresponding input iterator as the second.  Using Time Manipulators  Since C++11, you can use manipulators, deﬁned in  , to read and write time and date values directly from or to a stream. The manipulators use the get   or put   member of the corresponding facet. The manipulators are presented in Table 16.21. See Section 15.3.3, page 757, for an example of how to use these manipulators.   16.4 Facets in Detail  891  Manipulator put_time valPtr,fmt  Writes the date time value valPtr of type struct tm* according to  Effect  the format fmt; calls for the facet:  put strmBeg,strmEnd,strm,strm.fill  ,val,fmtBeg,fmtEnd  get_time valPtr,fmt  Reads a time date value into the struct tm* valPtr according to the  format fmt; calls for the facet:  get strmBeg,strmEnd,strm,err,val,fmtBeg,fmtEnd   Table16.21. ManipulatorsforTime DateFormatting  16.4.4 Character Classiﬁcation and Conversion  The C++ standard library deﬁnes two facets to deal with characters: ctype  and codecvt . Both belong to the category locale::ctype. The ctype  facet is used mainly for character classiﬁca- tion, such as testing whether a character is a letter. This facet also provides methods for conversion between lowercase and uppercase letters and for conversion between char and the character type for which the facet is instantiated. The codecvt  facet is used to convert characters between dif- ferent encodings and is used mainly by basic_filebuf to convert between external and internal representations.  Character Classiﬁcation  The ctype  facet is a class template parametrized by a character type. Three kinds of functions are provided by the class ctype : 1. Functions to convert between char and charT 2. Functions for character classiﬁcation 3. Functions for conversion between uppercase and lowercase letters Table 16.22 lists the members deﬁned for the facet ctype.  The function is beg,end,vec  is used to store a set of masks in an array. For each of the char- acters in the range between beg and end, a mask with the attributes corresponding to the character is stored in the array pointed to by vec. This is useful in order to avoid virtual function calls for the classiﬁcation of characters if many characters are to be classiﬁed.  toupper   and tolower   can be used to set a string uppercase or lowercase. For example: std::locale loc; std::string s;  for  char& c : s  {  }  c = std::use_facet > loc .toupper c ;  The function widen   can be used to convert a character of type char from the native character set to the corresponding character in the character set used by a locale. Thus, it makes sense to widen a character even if the result is also of type char. For the opposite direction, the function narrow   can be used to convert a character from the character set used by the locale to a corresponding char   892  Chapter 16: Internationalization  Expression ct.is m,c  ct.is beg,end,vec   ct.scan_is m,beg,end   ct.scan_not m,beg,end   ct.toupper c   ct.toupper beg,end   ct.tolower c   ct.tolower beg,end   ct.widen c  ct.widen beg,end,dest   ct.narrow c,default   ct.narrow beg,end,default,dest   Effect Tests whether the character c matches the mask m For each character in the range between beg and end, places a mask matched by the character in the corre- sponding location of vec Returns a pointer to the ﬁrst character in the range be- tween beg and end that matches the mask m or end if there is no such character Returns a pointer to the ﬁrst character in the range be- tween beg and end that does not match the mask m or end if all characters match the mask Returns an uppercase letter corresponding to c if there is such a letter; otherwise, c is returned Converts each letter in the range between beg and end by replacing the letter with the result of toupper   Returns a lowercase letter corresponding to c if there is such a letter; otherwise, c is returned Converts each letter in the range between beg and end by replacing the letter with the result of tolower   Returns the char converted into charT For each character in the range between beg and end, places the result of widen   at the corresponding loca- tion in dest Returns the charT c converted into char, or the char default if there is no suitable character For each character in the range between beg and end, places the result of narrow   at the corresponding loca- tion in dest  Table16.22. Membersofthe ctype  Facet  in the native character set, provided that there is such a char. For example, the following code converts the decimal digits from char to wchar_t:  std::locale loc; char narrow[] = "0123456789"; wchar_t wide[10];  std::use_facet > loc .widen narrow, narrow+10,  wide ;  Thus, the following convenience functions transform strings into wstrings and vice versa:     i18n wstring2string.hpp  include     16.4 Facets in Detail  include   include    893     convert string to wstring std::wstring to_wstring  const std::string& str,  const std::locale& loc = std::locale     std::vector  buf str.size   ; std::use_facet > loc .widen str.data  ,  return std::wstring buf.data  ,buf.size   ;  str.data  +str.size  , buf.data   ;     convert wstring to string with ’?’ as default character std::string to_string  const std::wstring& str,  const std::locale& loc = std::locale     std::vector  buf str.size   ; std::use_facet > loc .narrow str.data  ,  return std::string buf.data  ,buf.size   ;  str.data  +str.size  , ’?’, buf.data   ;  You can call these functions as follows:     i18n wstring2string.cpp  include   include   include "wstring2string.hpp"  int main   {  std::string s = "hello, world\n"; std::wstring ws = to_wstring s ; std::wcout << ws; std::cout << to_string ws ;  {  }  {  }  }  Class ctype derives from the class ctype_base. This class is used only to deﬁne an enumeration called mask. This enumeration deﬁnes values that can be combined to form a bitmask used for testing character properties. The values deﬁned in ctype_base are shown in Table 16.23. The functions   894  Chapter 16: Internationalization  for character classiﬁcation all take a bitmask as an argument, which is formed by combinations of the values deﬁned in ctype_base. To create bitmasks as needed, you can use the operators for bit manipulation  , &, ^, and ~ . A character matches this mask if it is any of the characters identiﬁed by the mask.

CharacterMaskValuesUsedbyctype   Specialization of ctype  for Type char  For better performance of the character classiﬁcation functions, the facet ctype is specialized for the character type char. This specialization does not delegate the functions dealing with character classiﬁcation  is  , scan_is  , and scan_not    to corresponding virtual functions. Instead, these functions are implemented inline using a table lookup. For this case, additional members are provided  Table 16.24 .6  Expression ctype ::table_size ctype ::classic_table   Returns the table for the “classic” C locale ctype  table,del=false  ct.table    Effect Returns the size of the table  >=256   Creates the facet with table table Returns the current table of facet ct  Table16.24. AdditionalMembersofctype   6 Before C++11, ctype ::table   and ctype ::classic_table   were accidentally speci- ﬁed to be protected instead of public members.   16.4 Facets in Detail  895  Manipulating the behavior of these functions for speciﬁc locales is done with a corresponding  table of masks that is passed as a constructor argument:     create and initialize the table std::ctype_base::mask mytable[std::ctype ::table_size] = {  ...  };     use the table for the ctype  facet ct std::ctype  ct mytable,false ;  This code constructs a ctype  facet that uses the table mytable to determine the character class of a character. More precisely, the character class of the character c is determined by  mytable[static_cast  c ]  The static member table_size is a constant deﬁned by the library implementation and gives the size of the lookup table. This size is at least 256 characters. The second optional argument to the constructor of ctype  indicates whether the table should be deleted if the facet is destroyed. If it is true, the table passed to the constructor is released by using delete[] when the facet is no longer needed.  The member function table   is a protected member function that returns the table that is passed as the ﬁrst argument to the constructor. The static protected member function classic_table   returns the table that is used for character classiﬁcation in the classic C locale.  Global Convenience Functions for Character Classiﬁcation  Convenient use of the ctype  facets is provided by predeﬁned global functions. Table 16.25 lists all the global functions. Note that for regular expressions, the same character classiﬁcations are possible  see Section 14.8, page 738 .  For example, the following expression determines whether the character c is a lowercase letter  The following expression returns the character c converted into an uppercase letter if c is a  in the locale loc:  std::islower c,loc   It returns a corresponding value of type bool.  lowercase letter in the locale loc:  std::toupper c,loc   The expression std::islower c,loc   is equivalent to the following expression:  If c is not a lowercase letter, the ﬁrst argument is returned unmodiﬁed.  std::use_facet > loc .is std::ctype_base::lower,c   This expression calls the member function is   of the facet ctype . is   determines whether the character c fulﬁlls any of the character properties that are passed as the bitmask in the   896  Chapter 16: Internationalization  Function isalnum c, loc   isalpha c, loc  isblank c, loc  iscntrl c, loc  isdigit c, loc  isgraph c, loc   Effect Returns whether c is a letter or a digit  equivalent to isalpha  isdigit    Returns whether c is a letter Returns whether c is a space or tabular  since C++11  Returns whether c is a control character Returns whether c is a digit Returns whether c is a printable, nonspace character  equivalent to isalnum  ispunct    Returns whether c is a lowercase letter Returns whether c is a printable character  including whitespaces  Returns whether c is a punctuation character  that is, it is printable but is not a space, digit, or letter  Returns whether c is a space character isspace c, loc  Returns whether c is an uppercase letter isupper c, loc  isxdigit c, loc  Returns whether c is a hexadecimal digit tolower c, loc  toupper c, loc   Converts c from an uppercase letter into a lowercase letter Converts c from a lowercase letter into an uppercase letter  islower c, loc  isprint c, loc  ispunct c, loc   Table16.25. GlobalConvenienceFunctionsforCharacterClassiﬁcation  ﬁrst argument. The values for the bitmask are deﬁned in the class ctype_base. See Section 13.2.14, page 688, and Section 15.13.3, page 833, for examples of the use of these convenience functions.  The global convenience functions for character classiﬁcation correspond to C functions that have the same name but only the ﬁrst argument. They are deﬁned in   and   and always use the current global C locale.7 Their use is even more convenient:  if  std::isdigit c   {  ...  }  However, by using them, you can’t use different locales in the same program. Also, you can’t use a user-deﬁned ctype facet using the C function. See Section 13.2.14, page 684, for an example that demonstrates how to use these C functions to convert all characters of a string to uppercase letters. It is important to note that the C++ convenience functions should not be used in code sections where performance is crucial. It is much faster to obtain the corresponding facet from the locale and to use the functions on this object directly. If many characters are to be classiﬁed according to the same locale, this can be improved even more, at least for non-char characters. The function is beg,end,vec  can be used to determine the masks for typical characters: This function deter- mines for each character in the range [beg,end  a mask that describes the properties of the character.  7 This locale is identical to the global C++ locale only if the last call to locale::global   was with a named locale and if there was no call to setlocale   since then. Otherwise, the locale used by the C functions is different from the global C++ locale.   16.4 Facets in Detail  897  The resulting mask is stored in vec at the position corresponding to the character’s position. This vector can then be used for fast lookup of the characters.  Character Encoding Conversion  The codecvt  facet is used to convert between internal and external character encoding. For example, it can be used to convert between Unicode and EUC  Extended UNIX Code , provided that the implementation of the C++ standard library supports a corresponding facet.  This facet is used by the class basic_filebuf to convert between the internal representation and the representation stored in a ﬁle. The class basic_filebuf   see Section 15.9.1, page 791  uses the instantiation codecvt  to do so. The facet used is taken from the locale stored with basic_filebuf. This is the major application of the codecvt facet. Only rarely is it necessary to use this facet directly.  Section 16.1, page 850, introduced some basics of character encodings. To understand codecvt, you need to know that there are two approaches for the encoding of characters: One is character encodings that use a ﬁxed number of bytes for each character  wide-character representation , and the other is character encodings that use a varying number of bytes per character  multibyte repre- sentation .  It is also necessary to know that multibyte representations use so-called shift states for space efﬁcient representation of characters. The correct interpretation of a byte is possible only with the correct shift state at this position. This in turn can be determined only by walking through the whole sequence of multibyte characters  see Section 16.1, page 850, for more details . The codecvt  facet takes three template arguments: 1. The character type internT used for an internal representation 2. The type externT used to represent an external representation 3. The type stateT used to represent an intermediate state during the conversion The intermediate state may consist of incomplete wide characters or the current shift state. The C++ standard makes no restriction about what is stored in the objects representing the state.  The internal representation always uses a representation with a ﬁxed number of bytes per char- acter. The two types char and wchar_t are intended mainly to be used within a program. The external representation may be a representation that uses a ﬁxed size or a multibyte representation. When a multibyte representation is used, the second template argument is the type used to represent the basic units of the multibyte encoding. Each multibyte character is stored in one or more objects of this type. Normally, the type char is used for this.  The third argument is the type used to represent the current state of the conversion. It is nec- essary, for example, if one of the character encodings is a multibyte encoding. In this case, the processing of a multibyte character might be terminated because the source buffer is drained or the destination buffer is full while one character is being processed. If this happens, the current state of the conversion is stored in an object of this type.  As with the other facets, the standard requires support for very few conversions. Only the fol-  lowing two instantiations are supported by the C++ standard library: 1. codecvt , which converts the native character set to itself  this is a  degenerated version of the codecvt  facet    898  Chapter 16: Internationalization  2. codecvt , which converts between the native tiny character set   char  and the native wide-character set  wchar_t   The C++ standard does not specify the exact semantics of the second conversion. The only natural thing to do, however, is to split each wchar_t into sizeof wchar_t  objects of type char for the conversion from wchar_t to char and to assemble a wchar_t from the same number of chars when converting in the opposite direction. Note that this conversion is very different from the conversion between char and wchar_t done by the widen   and narrow   member functions of the ctype facet. The codecvt functions use the bits of multiple chars to form one wchar_t  or vice versa , whereas the ctype functions convert a character into one encoding to the corresponding character in another encoding  if there is such a character .  Like the ctype facet, codecvt derives from a base class used to deﬁne an enumeration type. This class is named codecvt_base and deﬁnes an enumeration called result. The values of this enumeration are used to indicate the results of codecvt’s members. The exact meanings of the values depend on the member function used. Table 16.26 lists the member functions of the codecvt facet.  Expression cvt.in s,fb,fe,fn,tb,te,tn   Meaning Converts external representation to internal representa- tion  cvt.out s,fb,fe,fn,tb,te,tn  Converts internal representation to external representa-  cvt.unshift s,tb,te,tn  cvt.encoding   cvt.always_noconv   cvt.length s,fb,fe,max   cvt.max_length    tion Writes escape sequence to switch to initial shift state Returns information about the external encoding Returns true if no conversion will ever be done Returns the number of externTs from the sequence be- tween fb and fe to produce max internal characters Returns the maximum number of externTs necessary to produce one internT  Table16.26. Membersofthe codecvt  Facet  The function in   converts an external representation into an internal representation. The ar- gument s is a reference to a stateT. At the beginning, this argument represents the shift state used when the conversion is started. At the end, the ﬁnal shift state is stored there. The shift state passed in can differ from the initial state if the input buffer to be converted is not the ﬁrst buffer being converted. The arguments fb  from beginning  and fe  from end  are of type const internT* and represent the beginning and the end of the input buffer. The arguments tb  to begin  and te  to end  are of type externT* and represent the beginning and the end of the output buffer. The arguments fn  from next, of type const externT*&  and tn  to next, of type internT*&  are references used to return the end of the sequence converted in the input buffer and the output buffer, respectively. Either buffer may reach the end before the other buffer reaches the end. The function returns a value of type codecvt_base::result, as indicated in Table 16.27.  If ok is returned, the function made some progress. If fn == fe holds, the whole input buffer was processed, and the sequence between tb and tn contains the result of the conversion. The char-   16.4 Facets in Detail  899  Value ok partial Not all source characters were converted, or more characters are needed  Meaning All source characters were converted successfully  error noconv  to produce a destination character A source character was encountered that cannot be converted No conversion was necessary  Table16.27. ReturnValuesoftheConversionFunctions  acters in this sequence represent the characters from the input sequence, potentially with a ﬁnished character from a previous conversion. If the argument s passed to in   was not the initial state, a partial character from a previous conversion that was not completed could have been stored there.  If partial is returned, either the output buffer was full before the input buffer could be drained, or the input buffer was drained when a character was not yet complete  for example, because the last byte in the input sequence was part of an escape sequence switching between shift states . If fe==fn, the input buffer was drained. In this case, the sequence between tb and tn contains all characters that were converted completely, but the input sequence terminated with a partially converted character. The necessary information to complete this character’s conversion during a subsequent conversion is stored in the shift state s. If fe!=fn, the input buffer was not completely drained. In this case, te==tn holds; thus, the output buffer is full. The next time the conversion is continued, it should start with fn.  The return value noconv indicates a special situation. That is, no conversion was necessary to convert the external representation into the internal representation. In this case, fn is set to fb, and tn is set to tb. Nothing is stored in the destination sequence, because everything is already stored in the input sequence.  If error is returned, a source character that could not be converted was encountered. This can happen for several reasons. For example, the destination character set has no representation for a corresponding character, or the input sequence ends up with an illegal shift state. The C++ standard does not deﬁne any method that can be used to determine the cause of the error more precisely.  The function out   is equivalent to the function in   but converts in the opposite direction, converting an internal representation to an external representation. The meanings of the arguments and the values returned are the same; only the types of the arguments are swapped. That is, tb and te now have the type const internT*, and fb and fe now have the type const externT*. The same applies to fn and tn.  The function unshift   inserts characters necessary to complete a sequence when the current state of the conversion is passed as the argument s. This normally means that a shift state is switched to the initial switch state. Only the external representation is terminated. Thus, the arguments tb and tf are of type externT*, and tn is of type externT&*. The sequence between tb and te deﬁnes the output buffer in which the characters are stored. The end of the result sequence is stored in tn. unshift   returns a value as shown in Table 16.28.  The function encoding   returns some information about the encoding of the external represen- tation. If encoding   returns -1, the conversion is state dependent. If encoding   returns 0, the number of externTs needed to produce an internal character is not constant. Otherwise, the number   900  Chapter 16: Internationalization  Meaning The sequence was completed successfully  Value ok partial More characters need to be stored to complete the sequence error noconv  The state is invalid No character was needed to complete the sequence  Table16.28. ReturnValuesoftheFunction unshift    of externTs needed to produce an internT is returned. This information can be used to provide appropriate buffer sizes.  The function always_noconv   returns true if the functions in   and out   never perform a conversion. For example, the standard implementation of codecvt  does no conversion, so always_noconv   returns true for this facet. However, this holds only for the codecvt facet from the "C" locale. Other instances of this facet may do a conversion.  The function length   returns the number of externTs from the sequence between fb and fe necessary to produce max characters of type internT. If there are fewer than max complete internT characters in the sequence between fb and fe, the number of externTs used to produce a maximum number of internTs from the sequence is returned.  Standard Code Conversion Facets  Since, C++11, the C++ standard library guarantees to provide three code conversion facets in  , which are derived from codecvt :   codecvt_utf8  to convert between UTF-8 multibyte character sequences and UCS-2 sequences  if char16_t is used as character type  or UCS-4 UTF-32 sequences  if char32_t is used as character type    codecvt_utf16  to convert between UTF-16 multibyte character sequences and UCS-2 sequences  if char16_t is used as character type  or UCS-4 UTF-32 sequences  if char32_t is used as character type    codecvt_utf8_utf16  to convert between UTF-8 multibyte character sequences and  UTF-16 multibyte character sequences  Their ﬁrst template parameter is the wide-character type used  char16_t, char32_t, or wchar_t . The second template parameter is the maximum wide-character code allowed to convert without re- porting an error type std::codecvt_mode enabling reading or writing byte order marks or forcing little-endian mode.  0x10FFFF . The third template parameter  is a ﬂag of   default:  For example, the following facet allows to convert between UTF-8 and wide-characters of type wchar_t consuming byte order marks, producing byte order marks, and using little-endian mode for the wide characters:  std::codecvt_utf8<wchar_t,  0x10FFFF, std::consume_header   std::generate_header  std::little_endian>  wchar2utf8facet;   16.4 Facets in Detail  901  The most convenient way to use these facets is provided by class std::wstring_convert .  Class wstring_convert   Since C++11, class wstring_convert  allows convenient conversions between a wide-character string and a multibyte string. Template parameters are:   a code conversion facet   the type of the wide-character type  default: wchar_t    the allocator of the wide-character string  default: allocator     the allocator of the multibyte string  default: allocator   With the members to_bytes   and from_bytes   you can create multibyte sequences out of a single character, a null-terminated sequence of characters, a corresponding string, or a range of char- acters and vice versa  see Table 16.29 . The return type of from_bytes   is a string of the corre- sponding wide-character type  for example, wstring for wchar_t . The return type of to_bytes   is a string containing the multibyte sequence of chars.

MembersofClass wstring_convert   For example, the following convenience functions convert UTF-8 strings into wstrings and  vice versa:     i18n wstring2utf8.hpp  include   include       convert UTF-8 string to wstring std::wstring utf8_to_wstring  const std::string& str  {  std::wstring_convert > myconv; return myconv.from_bytes str ;  }   Chapter 16: Internationalization  902  }     convert wstring to UTF-8 string std::string wstring_to_utf8  const std::wstring& str  {  std::wstring_convert > myconv; return myconv.to_bytes str ;  The following program demonstrates the application of these functions, converting a string into a wstring  using to_wstring  , introduced in Section 16.4.4, page 892  and transforming this wstring into a multibyte string, which is written to standard output:     i18n wstring2utf8.cpp  include   include   include   include   include   include "wstring2string.hpp" include "wstring2utf8.hpp"  int main   {  try {  ifdef _MSC_VER     string with German umlaut and euro symbol  in Windows encoding : std::string s = "nj: ¨a + \x80 1";     convert to wide-character string  using Windows encoding : std::wstring ws = to_wstring s,std::locale "deu_DEU.1252"  ;     string with German umlaut and euro symbol  in ISO Latin-15 encoding : std::string s = "nj: ¨a + \xA4 1";     convert to wide-character string  using ISO Latin-15 encoding : std::wstring ws = to_wstring s,std::locale "de_DE.ISO-8859-15"  ;     print string as UTF-8 sequence: std::cout << wstring_to_utf8 ws  << std::endl;  } catch  const std::exception& e  {  std::cerr << "Exception: " << e.what   << std::endl; return EXIT_FAILURE;  else  endif  }  }   16.4 Facets in Detail  903  String s has the format of the 8-bit Windows-1252 or ISO-8859-15 byte sequence shown in Fig- ure 16.1 on page 852, which is written as the multibyte character sequence with the UTF-8 format in that ﬁgure.  Class wstring_buffer  Since C++11, class wbuffer_convert  allows creation of a stream buffer  see Section 15.13, page 826  with underlying conversions from wide characters to multibyte characters. For example, the following program converts UTF-8 character sequences into UTF-16 UCS-2 character sequences:     i18n wbuffer.cpp  include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {     create input stream reading UTF-8 sequences: wbuffer_convert > utf8inBuf cin.rdbuf   ; wistream utf8in &utf8inBuf ;     create output stream writing UTF-16 sequences: wbuffer_convert<codecvt_utf16<wchar_t, 0xFFFF, generate_header>>  utf16outBuf cout.rdbuf   ;  wostream utf16out &utf16outBuf ;     write each character read: wchar_t c; while  utf8in.get c   {  utf16out.put c ;  }  }  The program uses an input stream utf8in that reads UTF-8 multibyte character sequences into wide characters and an output stream utf16out that writes these wide characters as UTF-16 multibyte characters with leading byte order marks. That output almost matches a UCS-2 output because the character values are limited up to value 0xFFFF.   904  Chapter 16: Internationalization  16.4.5 String Collation  The collate  facet handles differences between conventions for the sorting of strings. For exam- ple, in German the letter ¨u is treated as being equivalent to the letter u or to the letters ue for the purpose of sorting strings. For other languages, this letter is not even a letter and is treated as a spe- cial character, when it is treated at all. Other languages use slightly different sorting rules for certain character sequences. The collate facet can be used to provide a sorting of strings that is familiar to the user. Table 16.30 lists the member functions of this facet. In this table, col is an instantiation of collate, and the arguments passed to the functions are iterators that are used to deﬁne strings.  Expression col.compare beg1,end1,beg2,end2  Returns  Meaning  col.transform beg,end   col.hash beg,end   1 if the ﬁrst string is greater than the second 0 if both strings are equal -1 if the ﬁrst string is smaller than the second  Returns a string to be compared with other trans- formed strings Returns a hash value  of type long  for the string  Table16.30. Membersofthe collate  Facet  The collate  facet is a class template that takes a character type charT as its template ar- gument. The strings passed to collate’s members are speciﬁed using iterators of type const charT*. This is somewhat unfortunate because there is no guarantee that the iterators used by the type basic_string  are also pointers. Thus, strings have to be compared as follows:  std::locale loc; std::string s1, s2; ...    get collate facet of the loc locale const std::collate & col = std::use_facet > loc ;     compare strings by using the collate facet int result = col.compare s1.data  , s1.data  +s1.size  ,  s2.data  , s2.data  +s2.size   ;  if  result == 0  {     s1 and s2 are equal ...  }  To check whether a string is less than another string according to a locale, you can use the function call operator of the locale, which internally returns whether the call of compare   returns -1:  bool result = loc s1,s2 ;     check s1<s2 according to locale loc  This can be used to pass a locale as sorting criterion  see Section 16.3, page 868 .   16.4 Facets in Detail  905  The transform   function returns an object of type basic_string . The lexicograph- ical order of strings returned from transform   is the same as the order of the original strings using collate  . This ordering can be used for better performance if one string has to be compared with many other strings. Determining the lexicographical order of strings can be much faster than using collate   because the national sorting rules can be relatively complex.  The C++ standard library mandates support only for the two instantiations collate  and collate . For other character types, users must write their own specializations, poten- tially using the standard instantiations.  16.4.6 Internationalized Messages  The messages  facet is used to retrieve internationalized messages from a catalog of messages. This facet is intended primarily to provide a service similar to that of the function perror  . This function is used in POSIX systems to print a system error message for an error number stored in the global variable errno. Of course, the service provided by messages is more ﬂexible. Unfortunately, it is not deﬁned very precisely.  The messages  facet is a class template that takes a character type charT as its template argument. The strings returned from this facet are of type basic_string . The basic use of this facet is to open a catalog, retrieve messages, and then close the catalog. The class messages derives from a class messages_base, which deﬁnes a type catalog, which is a type deﬁnition for int. An object of this type is used to identify the catalog on which the members of messages operate. Table 16.31 lists the member functions of the messages facet.  Expression msg.open name,loc  msg.get cat,set,msgid,def  Returns the message with ID msgid from catalog cat; if  Meaning Opens a catalog and returns a corresponding ID  msg.close cat   there is no such message, def is returned instead Closes the catalog cat  Table16.31. Membersofthe messages  Facet  The name passed as the argument to the open   function identiﬁes the catalog in which the message strings are stored. This catalog can be, for example, the name of a ﬁle. The loc argument identiﬁes a locale object that is used to access a ctype facet. This facet is used to convert the message to the desired character type.  The exact semantics of the get   member are not deﬁned. An implementation for POSIX sys- tems could, for example, return the string corresponding to the error message for error msgid, but this behavior is not required by the standard. The set argument is intended to create a substructure within the messages. For example, it might be used to distinguish between system errors and errors of the C++ standard library.  When a message catalog is no longer needed, it can be released by using the close   function. Although the interface using open   and close   suggests that the messages are retrieved from a   906  Chapter 16: Internationalization  ﬁle as needed, this is by no means required. It is more likely that open   reads a ﬁle and stores the messages in memory. A later call to close   would then release this memory.  The standard requires that the two instantiations messages  and messages   be stored in each locale. The C++ standard library does not support any other instantiations.   Chapter 17 Numerics  This chapter describes numeric components of the C++ standard library. In particular, it presents the components for random numbers and distributions, the classes for complex numbers, the global numeric functions that are inherited from the C library, and value arrays.  However, the C++ standard library provides more numeric components:  1. For all fundamental numeric data types, the implementation-speciﬁc aspects of their representa-  tion are speciﬁed by numeric_limits, as described in Section 5.3, page 115.  2. Class ratio  provides fractional arithmetics especially as a base for durations and timepoints   see Section 5.6, page 140 .  3. The STL contains some numeric algorithms, which are described in Section 11.11, page 623. 4. The C++ standard library provides a class valarray to deal with numeric arrays. However, in practice, this class plays almost no role; so besides a short introduction in Section 17.4, page 943, I provide details of valarrays in a supplementary chapter of the book, available at http:  www.cppstdlib.com.  17.1 Random Numbers and Distributions  Since C++11, the C++ standard library provides a random-number library that offers a wide range of classes and types to address the needs of both novices and experts to deal with random numbers and distributions. The library is more complex than a naive programmer might expect. At ﬁrst, the library provides many well-known distributions. But in addition, the C++ standard library provides multiple engines, which are the sources of randomness. These engines create random unsigned values, which are uniformly distributed between a predeﬁned minimum and a maximum; the distributions transfer those values into random numbers, which are linearly or nonlinearly distributed according to user- supplied parameters.1 Thus, you shouldn’t use the values generated by the engines directly  see Section 17.1.1, page 912, for details . There are multiple engines because nothing in a computer is  1 The correct technical term for what distributions provide is random variants rather than random numbers.   908  Chapter 17: Numerics  truly random and you might need much effort to provide good randomness, so the engines differ in quality, size, and speed.  Note that there is some confusion about the term random-number generator because it applies to  two different things: 1.  It might be a term for a source of randomness. In fact, according to the standard, each engine fulﬁlls the requirements of a “uniform random-number generator.” It might be a term for the mechanism to generate random numbers, which is a combination of an engine and a distribution.  2.  The latter is what we usually mean when we need random numbers in a program. Thus, you usually need an engine and a distribution, which is not a big deal, as we will see with the ﬁrst example.  To use the random-number library, you have to include the header ﬁle  .  17.1.1 A First Example  Before going into details, I provide a ﬁrst example for programmers who need random numbers or have to shufﬂe elements without caring in detail for the quality of the random numbers or the shufﬂing. The example is as follows:     num random1.cpp  include   include   include   include    int main   {     create default engine as source of randomness std::default_random_engine dre;     use engine to generate integral numbers between 10 and 20  both included  std::uniform_int_distribution  di 10,20 ; for  int i=0; i<20; ++i  {  std::cout << di dre  << " ";  } std::cout << std::endl;     use engine to generate ﬂoating-point numbers between 10.0 and 20.0     10.0 included, 20.0 not included  std::uniform_real_distribution  dr 10,20 ; for  int i=0; i<8; ++i  {  std::cout << dr dre  << " ";  }   17.1 Random Numbers and Distributions  909  std::cout << std::endl;     use engine to shufﬂe elements std::vector  v = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 }; ... std::shuffle  v.begin  , v.end  ,     range    source of randomness  dre ;  for  int i=0; i<v.size  ; ++i  {  std::cout << v[i] << " ";  } std::cout << std::endl;  }  The program demonstrates the general approach of the random-numbers library. After including the header ﬁle for the random-number library:  include    we create random numbers by combining an engine dre with two distributions di and dr:   Engines serve as a stateful source of randomness. They are function objects that are able to generate random unsigned values uniformly distributed according to a predeﬁned minimum and maximum.   Distributions serve as a way to specify how to use these random values to create random num-  bers that are distributed over a range of values according to user-supplied parameters.  The C++ standard library provides multiple engines because there are various approaches to gen- erating random values  algorithms and implementations differ in quality and performance . In this case, we use a default engine for “relatively casual, inexpert, and or lightweight use:”  std::default_random_engine dre;  According to the standard, this is “at least an acceptable engine ... on the basis of performance, size, quality, or any combination of such factors.” But which engine is chosen here is implementation deﬁned. For this reason, the output of the program might differ on different platforms.  The C++ standard library also provides various distributions for different value types: linear, normal Gauss, exponential, gamma, Bernoulli, and so on. For the most common form, a linear distribution, where the numbers are equally distributed over a range deﬁned by a given minimum and maximum value, two classes are provided, which we use here: one for integral and one for ﬂoating-point numbers.  First, we use uniform_int_distribution, which generates integral numbers. The type of these numbers has to be one of the types short, int, long, long long and their corresponding unsigned types. If no type is speciﬁed, int is the default. In the constructor, the ﬁrst argument speciﬁes the minimum value  default: 0 , and the second argument speciﬁes the maximum value  default: numeric_limits ::max  ; see Section 5.3, page 115 . Note that both minimum and maximum values can be generated, so this is not a half-open range. Thus, with the following statement we deﬁne that the random numbers of di are distributed over the values from 10 til 20  both included :  std::uniform_int_distribution  di 10,20 ;   910  di dre   The way to generate a number is to call operator    for the distribution, with the engine passed as argument. Thus, to generate and yield the “next” random number in this distribution we simply call:  Note that the initial state of an engine is well deﬁned and not random. Thus, the following statements will output the same value twice:  Chapter 17: Numerics  std::uniform_int_distribution  d; std::default_random_engine dre1; std::cout << d dre1  << " "; std::default_random_engine dre2; std::cout << d dre2  << " ";  If you need a nonpredictable random value, you have to set the state of the generator randomly by processing some behavior that you can’t inﬂuence with your code, such as the number of millisec- onds between two mouse clicks. That is, you have to pass a so-called seed to the constructor of the engine. For example:  unsigned int seed = ... std::default_random_engine dre seed ;     process some value really random    and use it for the initial engine state  Alternatively, you can use a seed to modify the state of an existing generator by using a member function.  In the same way, you can generate ﬂoating-point numbers. Note, however, that in this case the minimum and maximum passed indeed specify a half-open range. The default range is [0.0,1.0 . The possible types are float, double, or long double, with double as the default type. Thus, the following statement deﬁnes a distribution dr that generates values from 10.0 until the highest number just below 20.0:  std::uniform_real_distribution  dr 10,20 ;  By contrast, the following statement lets d generate double values from 0.0 until 0.9999..., or whatever the largest double below 1.0 is:  std::uniform_real_distribution  d;  Finally, the program demonstrates how to use a random-number generator to shufﬂe elements of a container or range. Since C++11, the algorithm shuffle    see Section 11.8.4, page 589  is pro- vided, which uses a uniform random-number generator, such as std::default_random_engine, to shufﬂe the elements:  std::default_random_engine dre; ... std::shuffle  v.begin  , v.end  ,  dre ;  The output of the program might look as follows:2     range    source of randomness  2 The term “might” is used because the exact deﬁnition of default_random_engine is implementation- deﬁned. The values here match a deﬁnition of default_random_engine as minstd_rand0.   17.1 Random Numbers and Distributions  911  10 11 18 15 15 12 10 17 17 20 14 15 19 10 10 15 17 10 14 10 16.8677 19.3044 15.2693 16.5392 17.0119 17.622 10.4746 13.2823 1 6 3 4 2 8 9 5 7  Be Careful with Temporary Engines  Note that you can but should not pass an engine just temporarily created.3 The reason is that each time you initialize an engine, its initial state is the same. Thus, if you program something like the following, the “shufﬂing” would happen twice in the same way:  std::shuffle v.begin  ,v.end  ,  std::default_random_engine   ;  ... std::shuffle v.begin  ,v.end  ,  std::default_random_engine   ;     range    random-number generator     range    random-number generator  That is, if the ﬁrst element is shufﬂed to the end the ﬁrst time, the ﬁrst element will be shufﬂed to the end again the next time. Thus, with each call, shufﬂing modiﬁes the positions of each element in the same way. For example:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 8 7 5 6 2 4 9 3 1 3 9 2 4 7 6 1 5 8     initial state    after ﬁrst shufﬂing    after second shufﬂing with engine with equal state  Here, in this example, you can see why such shufﬂing is a problem, besides that the effect of shufﬂing is predictable after the ﬁrst call. No matter how often you call shuffle  , the 4 would never get a position other than the fourth or sixth because, according to the current state, shuffle   simply swaps these two positions.  You should use the following code instead so that the shufﬂing will happen based on different  states:  std::default_random_engine dre; ... std::shuffle v.begin  ,v.end  ,  ... std::shuffle v.begin  ,v.end  ,  dre ;  dre ;     range    random-number generator     range    random-number generator  Now, each shufﬂing moves elements in a different way, which, for example, might look as follows:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 8 7 5 6 2 4 9 3 1 3 6 2 7 1 5 8 9 4     initial state    after ﬁrst shufﬂing    after second shufﬂing with engine with different state  3 Thanks to Walter E. Brown for pointing this out.   912  Chapter 17: Numerics  Don’t Use Engines without Distributions  Now the naive programmer might ask: Why can’t we just take an engine and use the value it produces as random numbers  if the range doesn’t ﬁt, I can simply use the modulo operator % ?  An important answer to this question is given in Section 7.4.4 of Accelerated C++ by Andrew Koenig and Barbara E. Moo  see [KoenigMoo:Accelerated] . They explain why using rand  , the standard random-value generator of C, causes problems that engines in general have. The essence is as follows  words and phrases in italics are quoted literally :  The technique to compute random numbers by using rand  %n in practice fails for two reasons:  1. Many pseudo-random-number generator implementations give remainders that aren’t very random, when the quotients passed as n are small integers. For example, it is not uncommon for successive results of rand   to be alternately even and odd. In that case, if n is 2, successive results of rand  %n will alternate between 0 and 1.  2. On the other hand, if the value of n is large, and the generated maximum value is not evenly divisible by n, some remainders will appear more often than others. For example, if the maximum is 32767 and n is 2000, 17 generated values  500, 2500, ..., 30500, 32500  would map to 500, while only 16 generated values  1500, 3500, ..., 31500  would map to 1500. And this gets worse the larger n is.  Good linear generators take this into account when mapping values generated by engines to their range of generated numbers. Thus, to get random numbers of good quality, you should always use both an engine and a distribution.  17.1.2 Engines  The C++ standard library provides 16 random-number engines, which you can use to process random numbers by combining them with a distribution or for shufﬂing  see Figure 17.1 .  As noted earlier, a random-number engine is a stateful source of randomness. Its state deﬁnes which sequence of random values, which are not random numbers  see Section 17.1.1, page 912 , are generated. With each function call, using operator   , you yield a new random unsigned value, while the internal state is changed to be able to yield a new random value afterward.  Note that normally the state transitions and values generated are exactly speciﬁed. Thus, with the same state, a speciﬁc engine will create the same random values on any platform. The only exception is the default_random_engine, which represents an implementation-speciﬁc engine. It still creates predictable values, but the algorithms used can vary from platform to platform.  You might argue that each value an engine generates should always be random, but nothing is truly random on a computer. If you really need a nonpredictable value, you have to set the state of the generator randomly by processing some behavior that you can’t inﬂuence with your code, for example, by processing the number of milliseconds between two mouse clicks.   17.1 Random Numbers and Distributions  913  default_random_engine   Predefined Parameterizations:   minstd_rand0   knuth_b   minstd_rand   mt19937   mt19937_64   ranlux24_base   ranlux48_base   ranlux24   ranlux48   Basic Engines:   linear_congruential_engine   mersenne_twister_engine   subtract_with_carry_engine   Engine Adapters:   discard_block_engine   independent_bits_engine   shuffle_order_engine   Figure17.1. PredeﬁnedRandom-NumberEngines  On the other hand, the predictability of the random values has the advantage that you can run the same “random” scenarios based on random numbers, which helps, for example, for the purpose of testing.  The following program demonstrates this:     num random2.cpp  include   include   include    void printNumbers  std::default_random_engine& dre  {  for  int i=0; i<6; ++i  {  std::cout << dre   << " ";  } std::cout << std::endl;  }  int main   {     create engine and generate numbers std::default_random_engine dre; printNumbers dre ;   914  Chapter 17: Numerics     create equal engine and generate numbers std::default_random_engine dre2; printNumbers dre2 ;     same initial state as dre     create engine with initial state speciﬁed by a seed std::default_random_engine dre3 42 ; printNumbers dre3 ;     save state of engine dre std::stringstream engineState; engineState << dre;     generate numbers according to current state of dre printNumbers dre ;     restore saved state of engine dre and create numbers again engineState >> dre; printNumbers dre ;     restore saved state of engine dre, skip 2 numbers and create numbers again engineState.clear  ; engineState.seekg 0 ; engineState >> dre; dre.discard 2 ; printNumbers dre ;     clear EOF bit    and move read position to the beginning  }  The program might have the following output:4  16807 282475249 1622650073 984943658 1144108930 470211272 16807 282475249 1622650073 984943658 1144108930 470211272 705894 1126542223 1579310009 565444343 807934826 421520601 101027544 1457850878 1458777923 2007237709 823564440 1115438165 101027544 1457850878 1458777923 2007237709 823564440 1115438165 1458777923 2007237709 823564440 1115438165 1784484492 74243042  After declaring a random-number engine  the default one in this case , we can use operator    to generate values:  std::default_random_engine dre; ... dre    4 The exact output differs because the default_random_engine is implementation-deﬁned. The values here match a deﬁnition of default_random_engine as minstd_rand0.   17.1 Random Numbers and Distributions  915  Thus, an engine is a function object  an object that behaves like a function; see Section 6.10, page 233 .  The generated values are unsigned integral values. The exact type can usually be speciﬁed ex- cept for default_random_engine, where the type is implementation deﬁned. For each engine, result_type yields the type, and the static member functions min   and max   yield the mini- mum and maximum values that can be generated  both included .  If you declare an equal engine again, it will have the same initial state and therefore pro- duce the same random values. To get the same state, you could also pass the engine by value to printNumbers   twice. Because printNumbers   would operate on a temporary copy of dre with each call, this would also generate the same numbers twice.  The next statement shows how to pass an initial seed value to change the initial state of the  engine:  std::default_random_engine dre3 42 ;  Here, usually, you would pass a value coming from outside the program to start with a truly random value  for example, the duration between two clicks or a value processed out of a real-time clock . The following statements demonstrate two other possibilities all engines have. You can use operators  > to save and restore the state of an engine.5 The following statements write the state into a string by using a string stream  see Section 15.10, page 802 :  std::ostringstream engineState; engineState << dre;  This state will be a sequence of values separated by spaces.  This is not a sequence of random numbers!  If we change the state of dre — for example, by generating numbers — and restore the state afterward, the engine will have the state it had when the state was saved and generate the same values again.  With the following statement we skip two states: dre.discard 2 ;  Thus, afterward, dre is in the same state as if two values had been generated instead. However, discard   might be and often is faster than stepping through all states by calling operator   .  17.1.3 Engines in Detail  As Figure 17.1  Section 17.1, page 913  demonstrates, we can put the engines provided by the C++ standard library into various categories:   Basic engines, which provide various basic algorithms to generate random values:  – Class std::linear_congruential_engine – Class std::mersenne_twister_engine – Class std::subtract_with_carry_engine  5 This is probably the ﬁrst and only serialization interface in the C++ standard library.   916  Chapter 17: Numerics    Engine adapters, which can be initialized by a  basic  engine:  – Class std::discard_block_engine, which adapts an engine by discarding a given  – Class std::independent_bits_engine, which adapts an engine to produce random  – Class std::shuffle_order_engine, which adapts an engine by permutation of the  number of generated values each time  values with a speciﬁed number of bits  order of their generated values    Adapters with predeﬁned parameters:  – std::minstd_rand0 – std::minstd_rand – std::mt19937 – std::mt19937_64 – std::ranlux24_base – std::ranlux48_base – std::ranlux24 – std::ranlux48 – std::knuth_b  For example, type knuth_b is a shortcut for:  shuffle_order_engine<linear_congruential_engine<uint_fast32_t,  16807, 0, 2147483647>,  256>  In addition, std::default_random_engine is an implementation-speciﬁc type deﬁnition. This is the only engine type that does not guarantee generation of identical value sequences on different platforms.  Effect Default constructor; creates engine with default initial state  Operation engine e engine e seed  Creates engine with state according to seed engine e e2  e.seed   e.seed seed  e   e.discard n  e1 == e2 e1 != e2 ostrm << e istrm >> e  Copy constructor; copies engine  e and e2 will have equal state  Sets engine d to default initial state Sets engine d to state according to seed Returns next random value and advances its state Advances to the nth next state  like n calls of e   but might be faster  Returns whether e1 and e2 have an equal state Returns whether e1 and e2 don’t have an equal state Writes the state of e to the output stream ostrm Reads a new state from the input stream istrm into e  Table17.1. OperationsofRandom-NumberEngines   17.1 Random Numbers and Distributions  917  Table 17.1 lists the operations provided for random-number engines. All default-constructed engines of the same type initially have the same state, which means that operator == yields true, and both engines will produce an equal list of “random” values. Thus, you need a seed to produce different random values.  The state written by operator << is a list of decimal values separated by a space. Although this  might look like a list of random values, it is not.  It is guaranteed that, when reading a written state by an engine of the same type, the engine  becomes the same state  operator == yields true and equal values are generated .  17.1.4 Distributions  As written, distributions transform random values generated by an engine into real and useful ran- dom numbers. The probability of the numbers generated depends on the speciﬁc distribution used, which can be parametrized according to the programmer’s needs. Table 17.2 gives an overview of all distributions provided by the C++ standard library.

DistributionsProvidedbytheC++StandardLibrary   918  Chapter 17: Numerics  Almost all distributions are templates parametrized by the type of the generated values. The only exception is bernoulli_distribution, which is simply a class because it generates only bools. The default types are:   int for IntType   double for RealType The C++ standard library guarantees that the following template instantiations are provided:   For IntType: short, int, long, long long, and their corresponding unsigned types   For RealType: float, double, long double Table 17.3 lists the operations provided for distributions.  Operation distr::result_type distr d distr d args  d e   d.min   d.max   d1 == d2 d1 != d2 ostrm << d istrm >> d distr::param_type distr d pt  d.param pt  d.param   d e,pt   d.param    Effect The arithmetic type of the values generated Default constructor; creates a distribution with default parameters Creates a distribution parametrized by args Returns the next value according to engine generator e and advances the state of e Returns the minimum value Returns the maximum value Returns whether d1 and d2 have an equal state Returns whether d1 and d2 don’t have an equal state Writes the state of d to the output stream ostrm Reads a new state from the input stream istrm into d The type for the parametrization of distr Creates a distribution parametrized by param_type pt Sets the current parametrization to param_type pt Returns the current parametrization as type param_type Returns the next value according to the engine generator e and to the param_type pt and advances the state of e Returns the value of parameter param  Table17.3. TypesandOperationsofDistributions  A distribution might be parametrized, so args and pt depend on the speciﬁc distribution. To deal with this parametrization, you can   Pass these parameters as args to the constructor   Use a member named according to the parameter to query its value   Use its param_type to  – Pass these parameters as one argument to the constructor – Pass these parameters to the next value generation – Query the value of these parameters The param_type should itself provide a constructor to pass the parameter value s  and named members to query their values.   17.1 Random Numbers and Distributions  919  For example, the uniform distributions have two parameters, a and b, which correspond with mini- mum and maximum  see Section 17.1.5, page 921 . As a consequence, you can pass the arguments individually:     initialize parameters ‘‘a’’ and ‘‘b’’  uniform_int_distribution  d 0, 20 ; d.a   d.b   d.param  .a   d.param  .b       yields value of parameter ‘‘a’’    yields value of parameter ‘‘b’’    yields value of parameter ‘‘a’’    yields value of parameter ‘‘b’’  Or you can use a param_type to pass them as a whole:  uniform_int_distribution ::param_type pt 100, 200 ; d e,pt  d.param pt ;     generates one value according to parametrization pt    let all generated values use parametrization pt     other parametrization  Only the sampling distributions use special constructors to pass vectors of values or a value gener- ator.  Note that the maximum value passed as a parameter to distributions might sometimes be included  and sometimes be excluded.  As for random engines, the state written by operator << is a list of decimal values separated by a  space. Although this might look like a list of random numbers, it is not. The following program demonstrates how distributions can be used:     num dist1.cpp  include   include   include   include   include    template   void distr  Distr d, Eng e, const std::string& name  {     print min, max and four example values std::cout << name << ":" << std::endl; std::cout << "- min  : std::cout << "- max  : std::cout << "- values: " << d e  << ’ ’ << d e  << ’ ’  " << d.min   << std::endl; " << d.max   << std::endl;  << d e  << ’ ’ << d e  << std::endl;     count the generated values  converted to integral values  std::map  valuecounter; for  int i=0; i<200000; ++i  {  valuecounter[d e ]++;  }   920  Chapter 17: Numerics     and print the resulting distribution std::cout << "====" << std::endl; for  auto elem : valuecounter  {  } std::cout << "====" << std::endl; std::cout << std::endl;  std::cout << std::setw 3  << elem.first << ": "  << elem.second << std::endl;  int main   {  std::knuth_b e;  std::uniform_real_distribution  ud 0, 10 ; distr ud,e,"uniform_real_distribution" ;  std::normal_distribution  nd; distr nd,e,"normal_distribution" ;  std::exponential_distribution  ed; distr ed,e,"exponential_distribution" ;  std::gamma_distribution  gd; distr gd,e,"gamma_distribution" ;  }  }  0: 20087 1: 20057 2: 19878 3: 19877 4: 20005 5: 20118 6: 20063 7: 19886 8: 20003 9: 20026  ====  On my machine, the program has the following output  distributed over two columns :  uniform_real_distribution: - min  : - max  : - values: 8.30965 1.30427 9.47764 3.83416 ====  0 10  normal_distribution: - min  : - max  : - values: -0.131724 0.117963 -0.140331 0.538967 ====  2.22507e-308 1.79769e+308  -4: 9 -3: 245 -2: 4325 -1: 26843  0: 136947 1: 26987 2: 4377 3: 258 4: 9  ====   17.1 Random Numbers and Distributions  921  exponential_distribution: - min  : - max  : - values: 0.185167 2.03694 0.0536495 0.958636 ====  0 1.79769e+308  gamma_distribution: - min  : - max  : - values: 0.117964 1.60557 0.558526 1.21066 ====  0 1.79769e+308  0: 126487 1: 46436 2: 17120 3: 6294 4: 2326 5: 865 6: 283 7: 107 8: 52 9: 17  10: 6 11: 6 12: 1  ====  0: 126315 1: 46477 2: 17160 3: 6271 4: 2413 5: 866 6: 327 7: 109 8: 41 9: 12  10: 7 11: 1 12: 1  ====  17.1.5 Distributions in Detail  The distributions, their probability  density  functions, and their parameters are as follows:  uniform_int_distribution:  P  i a, b  = 1  b − a + 1   Parameters:  IntType a  default: 0  IntType b  default: limits::max     uniform_real_distribution:  p x a, b  = 1  b − a   Parameters:  RealType a  default: 0.0  RealType b  default: 1.0   bernoulli_distribution:  Parameters:  double p  default: 0.5    cid:2   P  b p  =  if p 1 − p if  b = true b = false   922  Chapter 17: Numerics  binomial_distribution:  Parameters:  IntType t  default: 1  double p  default: 0.5   geometric_distribution:  Parameters:  double p  default: 0.5    cid:3    cid:4   t i  P  i t, p  =  · pi ·  1 − p t−i  P  i p  = p ·  1 − p i  negative_binomial_distribution: P  i k, p  =   cid:3  k + i − 1   cid:4   i  · pk ·  1 − p i  P  i μ  = e  −μμi i !  p x λ  = λe  −λx  Parameters:  IntType k  default: 1  double p  default: 0.5   poisson_distribution:  Parameters:  double mean  default: 1.0   exponential_distribution:  Parameters:  RealType lambda  default: 1.0   gamma_distribution:  Parameters:  RealType alpha  default: 1.0  RealType beta  default: 1.0   weibull_distribution:  p x α, β  = e  −x β βα · Γ α   · x α−1   cid:5    cid:6 a−1 · exp   cid:5   −   cid:5    cid:6 a cid:6   x b  p x a, b  = a b  ·  x b   17.1 Random Numbers and Distributions  923  Parameters:  RealType a  default: 1.0  RealType b  default: 1.0   extreme_value_distribution: p x a, b  =   cid:3    cid:3    cid:4  cid:4   · exp  1 b  a − x b  − exp  a − x b  Parameters:  RealType a  default: 1.0  RealType b  default: 1.0   normal_distribution:  Parameters:  RealType mean  default: 0.0  RealType stddev  default: 1.0   lognormal_distribution:  p x μ, σ  =  √ 1 2π  σ  · exp  −  x − μ 2 2σ2   cid:3    cid:3    cid:4    cid:4   p x m, s  =  √ 1 sx  2π  · exp  −  ln x − m 2  2s2  Parameters:  RealType m  default: 0.0  RealType s  default: 1.0   chi_squared_distribution:  Parameters:  RealType n  default: 1   cauchy_distribution:  Parameters:  RealType a  default: 1.0  RealType b  default: 1.0   p x n  = x n 2 −1 · e  −x 2 Γ n 2  · 2n 2   cid:7    cid:7    cid:3    cid:8  cid:8 −1   cid:4 2  p x a, b  =  πb  1 +  x − a b   924  Chapter 17: Numerics  fisher_f_distribution:   cid:9   p x m, n  =   m + n  2  Γ Γ m 2  Γ n 2   ·  m n   cid:10    cid:5    cid:6 m 2 · x m 2 −1 ·   cid:5    cid:6 − m+n  2  1 + mx n  Parameters:  RealType m  default: 1  RealType n  default: 1   student_t_distribution: p x n  =  Parameters:  RealType n  default: 1   discrete_distribution:   cid:9    cid:10    cid:3   · Γ  1√ nπ   n + 1  2 Γ n 2   ·  1 + x2 n   cid:4 − n+1  2  .

Further details are given in the exact descriptions in the C++ standard library.   17.2 Complex Numbers  925  17.2 Complex Numbers  The C++ standard library provides the class template complex  to operate on complex numbers. Complex numbers have two parts: real and imaginary. The imaginary part has the property that its square is a negative number. In other words, the imaginary part of a complex number is the factor i, which is the square root of -1.  Recent Changes with C++11  C++98 speciﬁed almost all features of the class complex . With the ﬁrst standardization of C++, almost all features of class complex were speciﬁed. In fact, except for using constexpr where appropriate, none of the new language features of C++11 had an impact of class complex  and its specializations. Only a few ﬁxes and enhancements were added:   The following operations taking a complex number as argument were added: proj  , asin  ,   With real val  and imag val , you can now set the real and imaginary part directly.  acos  , atan  , asin  , acosh  , atanh  .  17.2.1 Class complex  in General  The class complex  is declared in the header ﬁle  :  include    In  , the class complex  is deﬁned as follows:  namespace std {  template   class complex;  }  }  The template parameter T is used as the scalar type of both the real and the imaginary parts of the complex number.  In addition, the C++ standard library provides three specializations for float, double, and long  double:  namespace std {  template  class complex ; template  class complex ; template  class complex ;  These types are provided to allow certain optimizations and some safer conversions from one com- plex type to the other.   926  Chapter 17: Numerics  17.2.2 Examples Using Class complex   The following program demonstrates some of the abilities of class complex  to create complex numbers, print different representations of complex numbers, and perform some common operations on complex numbers:     num complex1.cpp  include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {     complex number with real and imaginary parts    - real part: 4.0    - imaginary part: 3.0 complex  c1 4.0,3.0 ;     create complex number from polar coordinates    - magnitude: 5.0    - phase angle: 0.75 complex  c2 polar 5.0,0.75  ;     print complex numbers with real and imaginary parts cout << "c1: " << c1 << endl; cout << "c2: " << c2 << endl;     print complex numbers as polar coordinates cout << "c1: magnitude: " << abs c1   << "  squared magnitude: " << norm c1  << "  " <<  " phase angle: " << arg c1  << endl;  cout << "c2: magnitude: " << abs c2   << "  squared magnitude: " << norm c2  << "  " <<  " phase angle: " << arg c2  << endl;     print complex conjugates cout << "c1 conjugated: cout << "c2 conjugated:  " << conj c1  << endl; " << conj c2  << endl;     print result of a computation cout << "4.4 + c1 * 1.8: " << 4.4 + c1 * 1.8 << endl;     print sum of c1 and c2:   17.2 Complex Numbers  927     - note: different types cout << "c1 + c2:  "    c2.real  ,c2.imag    << endl;     add square root of c1 to c1 and print the result cout << "c1 += sqrt c1 : " <<  c1 += sqrt c1   << endl;  }  The program might have the following output  the exact output depends on the implementation- speciﬁc properties of the type double :  c1:  4,3  c2:  3.65844,3.40819  c1: magnitude: 5  squared magnitude: 25  c2: magnitude: 5  squared magnitude: 25  c1 conjugated: c2 conjugated: 4.4 + c1 * 1.8:  11.6,5.4  c1 + c2:  7.65844,6.40819  c1 += sqrt c1 :  6.12132,3.70711    4,-3   3.65844,-3.40819   phase angle: 0.643501 phase angle: 0.75  A second example contains a loop that reads two complex numbers and processes the ﬁrst complex number raised to the power of the second complex number:     num complex2.cpp  include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {  complex  c1, c2;  while  cin.peek   != EOF  {     read ﬁrst complex number cout << "complex number c1: "; cin >> c1; if  !cin  {  cerr << "input error" << endl; return EXIT_FAILURE;  }   928  Chapter 17: Numerics     read second complex number cout << "complex number c2: "; cin >> c2; if  !cin  {  cerr << "input error" << endl; return EXIT_FAILURE;  }  }  if  c1 == c2  {  cout << "c1 and c2 are equal !" << endl;  cout << "c1 raised to the c2: " << pow c1,c2   << endl << endl;     skip rest of line cin.ignore numeric_limits ::max  ,’\n’ ;  }  }  Table 17.4 shows some possible input and output of this program. Note that you can input a complex number by passing only the real part as a single value with or without parentheses or by passing the real and imaginary parts separated by a comma in parentheses.  c1 2  16   8,0  0.99  0,2   1.7,0.3   3,4   1.7,0.3   c2 2 0.5 0.333333333  5  2 0  -4,3   4.3,2.8   Output c1 raised to c2:  4,0  c1 raised to c2:  4,0  c1 raised to c2:  2,0  c1 raised to c2:  0.95099,0  c1 raised to c2:  -4,4.89843e-16  c1 raised to c2:  1,0  c1 raised to c2:  4.32424e-05,8.91396e-05  c1 raised to c2:  -4.17622,4.86871   Table17.4. PossibleI Oof complex2.cpp Example  17.2.3 Operations for Complex Numbers  The class template complex  provides the operations described in the following subsections.   17.2 Complex Numbers  929  Create, Copy, and Assign Operations  Table 17.5 lists the constructors and assignment operations for complex. The constructors provide the ability to pass the initial values of the real and the imaginary parts. If they are not passed, they are initialized by the default constructor of the value type.  Expression complex c  complex c 1.3   Effect Creates a complex number with 0 as the real part and 0 as the imaginary part  0 + 0i  Creates a complex number with 1.3 as the real part and 0 as the imaginary part  1.3 + 0i   complex c 1.3,4.2  Creates a complex number with 1.3 as the real part and 4.2 as  complex c1 c2  polar 4.2   polar 4.2,0.75   conj c   proj c   c1 = c2 c1 += c2 c1 -= c2 c1 *= c2 c1  = c2  the imaginary part  1.3 + 4.2i  Creates c1 as a copy of c2 Creates a temporary complex number from polar coordinates  4.2 as magnitude rho and 0 as phase angle theta  Creates a temporary complex number from polar coordinates  4.2 as magnitude rho and 0.75 as phase angle theta  Creates a temporary complex number that is the conjugated complex number of c  the complex number with the negated imaginary part  Creates a temporary complex number from the projection of c onto the Riemann sphere  since C++11  Assigns the values of c2 to c1 Adds the value of c2 to c1 Subtracts the value of c2 from c1 Multiplies the value of c2 by c1 Divides the value of c2 into c1  Table17.5. ConstructorsandAssignmentOperationsofClasscomplex   The assignment operators are the only way to modify the value of an existing complex number. The computed assignment operators +=, -=, *=, and  = add, subtract, multiply, and divide the value of the second operand to, from, by, and into the ﬁrst operand.  The auxiliary polar   function provides the ability to create a complex number that is initialized  by polar coordinates  magnitude and phase angle in radians :     create a complex number initialized from polar coordinates std::complex  c2 std::polar 4.2,0.75  ;  A problem exists when you have an implicit type conversion during the creation. For example, this notation works:  std::complex  c2 std::polar 4.2,0.75  ; However, the following notation with the equal sign does not:     OK  std::complex  c2 = std::polar 4.2,0.75 ;     ERROR   930  Chapter 17: Numerics  This problem is discussed in the next subsection.  The auxiliary conj   function provides the ability to create a complex number that is initialized by the conjugated complex value of another complex number  a conjugated complex value is the value with a negated imaginary part :  std::complex  c1 1.1,5.5 ; std::complex  c2 conj c1  ;     initialize c2 with    complex  1.1,-5.5   Since C++11, the auxiliary proj   function is provided, which creates a complex number computed as a projection of another complex number onto the Riemann sphere.  Implicit Type Conversions  The constructors of the specializations for float, double, and long double are designed in such a way that safe conversions, such as complex  to complex , are allowed to be implicit but less safe conversions, such as complex  to complex , must be explicit:  std::complex  cf; std::complex  cd; std::complex  cld; ... std::complex  cd1 = cf; std::complex  cd2 = cld; std::complex  cd3 cld ;     OK: safe conversion    ERROR: no implicit conversion    OK: explicit conversion  In addition, no constructors from any other complex type are deﬁned. In particular, you can’t convert a complex with an integral value type into a complex with value type float, double, or long double. However, you can convert the values by passing the real and imaginary parts as separate arguments:  std::complex  cd; std::complex  ci; ... std::complex  cd4 = ci; std::complex  cd5 ci ; std::complex  cd6 ci.real  ,ci.imag   ;     ERROR: no implicit conversion    ERROR: no explicit conversion     OK  Unfortunately, the assignment operators allow less safe conversions. These operators are provided as function templates for all types. So, you can assign any complex type as long as the value types are convertible:6  std::complex  cd; std::complex  cld;  6 The fact that constructors for the complex specializations allow only safe implicit conversions, whereas the assignment operations allow any implicit conversion, is probably a mistake in the standard.   17.2 Complex Numbers  931  std::complex  ci; ... cd = ci; cd = cld;     OK    OK  This problem also relates to polar  , conj  , and proj  . For example, the following notation works ﬁne:  std::complex  c2 std::polar 4.2,0.75  ;     OK  But the notation with the equal sign does not:  std::complex  c2 = std::polar 4.2,0.75 ;     ERROR  The reason for this is that the expression  std::polar 4.2,0.75   creates a temporary complex , and the implicit conversion from complex  to complex  is not deﬁned.7  Value Access  Table 17.6 shows the functions provided to access the attributes of complex numbers.  Effect Returns the value of the real part  as a global function  Returns the value of the real part  as a member function   Expression real c  c.real   c.real 1.7  Assigns 1.7 as new real part  since C++11  imag c  c.imag   c.imag 1.7  Assigns 1.7 as new imaginary part  since C++11   Returns the value of the imaginary part  as a global function  Returns the value of the imaginary part  as a member function    cid:11   abs c  norm c  arg c   Returns the absolute value of c   Returns the squared absolute value of c  c.real  2 + c.imag  2  Returns the angle of the polar representation of c  ϕ   equivalent to atan2 c.imag  ,c.real    as phase angle   c.real  2 + c.imag  2   Table17.6. OperationsforValueAccessofClasscomplex   Note that before C++11, real   and imag   provided only read access to the real and the imaginary parts. Changing only the real part or only the imaginary part required assigning a new complex number. For example, the following statement set the imaginary part of c to 3.7:  std::complex  c; ... c = std::complex  c.real  ,3.7 ;     since C++11: c.imag 3.7   7 In general, the initialization syntax with = requires that an implicit type conversion is provided.   932  Comparison Operations  Chapter 17: Numerics  To compare complex numbers, you can check only for equality  Table 17.7 . The operators == and != are deﬁned as global functions, so one of the operands may be a scalar value. If you use a scalar value as the operand, it is interpreted as the real part, with the imaginary part having the default value of its type, which is usually 0.  Expression Effect c1 == c2  c == 1.7  1.7 == c  c1 != c2  c != 1.7  1.7 != c  Returns whether c1 is equal to c2  c1.real  ==c2.real   && c1.imag  ==c2.imag    Returns whether c is equal to 1.7  c.real  ==1.7 && c.imag  ==0.0  Returns whether c is equal to 1.7  c.real  ==1.7 && c.imag  ==0.0  Returns whether c1 differs from c2  c1.real  !=c2.real    c1.imag  !=c2.imag    Returns whether c differs from 1.7  c.real  !=1.7  c.imag  !=0.0  Returns whether c differs from 1.7  c.real  !=1.7  c.imag  !=0.0   Table17.7. ComparisonOperationsofClass complex   Other comparison operations, such as operator <, are not deﬁned. Although it is not impossible to deﬁne an ordering for complex values, such orderings are neither very intuitive nor very useful. Note, for example, that the magnitude of complex numbers by itself is not a good basis for ordering complex values, because two complex values can be very different and yet have identical magnitude  1 and -1 are two such numbers . An ad hoc criterion can be added to create a valid ordering. For example, given two complex values c1 and c2, you could deem c1 < c2 when c1 < c2 or, if both magnitudes are equal, when arg c1  < arg c2 . However, such a criterion invariably has little or no mathematical meaning.8  As a consequence, you can’t use complex  as the element type of an associative container, provided you use no user-deﬁned sorting criterion. The reason is that associative containers use the function object less , which calls operator <, to be able to sort the elements  see Section 6.11.1, page 244 .  By implementing a user-deﬁned operator <, you could sort complex numbers and use them in associative containers. Note that you should be very careful not to pollute the standard namespace. For example:  8 Thanks to David Vandevoorde for pointing this out.   17.2 Complex Numbers  933  template   bool operator & c1, const std::complex & c2   return std::abs c1 <std::abs c2     std::abs c1 ==std::abs c2  &&  std::arg c1 <std::arg c2  ;  {  }  Arithmetic Operations  Complex numbers provide the four basic arithmetic operations and the negative and positive signs  Table 17.8 .

Unfortunately, you can’t specify the separator of complex numbers between the real and the imaginary parts. So, if you have a comma as a “decimal point,” as in German, I O looks really strange. For example, a complex number with 4.6 as the real part and 2.7 as the imaginary part would be written as   4,6,2,7   See Section 17.2.2, page 927, for an example of how to use the I O operations.   17.2 Complex Numbers  Transcendental Functions  935  Table 17.10 lists the transcendental functions  trigonometric, exponential, and so on  for complex.

Creates a complex value in which the real and the imaginary parts are initialized by an explicit call of their default constructor. Thus, for fundamental types, the initial value of the real and the imaginary parts is 0  see Section 3.2.1, page 37, for the default value of fundamental types .  complex::complex  const T& re    Creates a complex value in which re is the value of the real part, and the imaginary part is   This constructor also deﬁnes an automatic type conversion from T to complex.  initialized by an explicit call of its default constructor  0 for fundamental data types .  complex::complex  const T& re, const T& im    Creates a complex value, with re as the real part and im as the imaginary part.  complex polar  const T& rho  complex polar  const T& rho, const T& theta    Both forms create and return the complex number that is initialized by polar coordinates.   rho is the magnitude.   theta is the phase angle in radians  default: 0 .  complex conj  const complex& cmplx    Creates and returns the complex number that is initialized by the conjugated complex value  the  value with the negated imaginary part  of cmplx.  complex proj  const complex& cmplx    Creates and returns a temporary complex number from the projection of x onto the Riemann   The behavior is equivalent to the C function cproj  .

In general, this function is provided as both a nontemplate and a template function  see Sec- tion 3.2, page 34, for an introduction to member templates . Thus, in general, automatic type conversions of the element type are provided.   However, the specializations for float, double, and long double restrict copy constructors, so less safe conversions — from double and long double to float, as well as from long   17.2 Complex Numbers  937  double to double — are not implicitly possible. See Section 17.2.3, page 930, for more infor- mation about the implications from this.  complex& complex::operator =  const complex& cmplx    Assigns the value of complex cmplx.   Returns *this.   This function is provided as both a nontemplate and a template function  see Section 3.2, page 34, for an introduction to member templates . Thus, automatic type conversions of the element type are provided.  This is also the case for the specializations that are provided by the C++ standard library.   complex& complex::operator +=  const complex& cmplx  complex& complex::operator -=  const complex& cmplx  complex& complex::operator *=  const complex& cmplx  complex& complex::operator  =  const complex& cmplx    These operations add, subtract, multiply, and divide the value of cmplx to, from, by, and into   They return *this.   These operations are provided as both a nontemplate and a template function  see Section 3.2, page 34, for an introduction to member templates .

Note that the assignment operators are the only functions that allow you to modify the value of an existing complex.  Element Access  T complex::real    const T real  const complex& cmplx  T complex::imag    const T imag  const complex& cmplx    These functions return the real or the imaginary part, respectively.   Note that the return value is not a reference. Thus, you can’t use these functions to modify the real or the imaginary parts. To change only the real part or only the imaginary part, you must assign a new complex number  see Section 17.2.3, page 931 .  T complex::real  const T& re  T complex::imag  const T& im    These functions assign re or im as new real or imaginary part, respectively.   Available since C++11. Before C++11, to modify only the real part or only the imaginary part,  you had to assign a new complex number  see Section 17.2.3, page 931 .   938  Chapter 17: Numerics  T abs  const complex& cmplx    Returns the absolute value  magnitude  of cmplx.

It is equivalent to atan2 cmplx.imag  ,cmplx.real    as the phase angle.

FunctionsoftheHeaderFile   In contrast to C, C++ overloads some operations for different types, which makes some numeric functions of C obsolete. For example, C provides abs  , labs  , llabs  , fabs  , fabsf  , and fabsl   to process the absolute value of int, long, long long, double, float  , and long double, respectively. In C++, abs   is overloaded so that you can use abs   for all these data types.  9 For historical reasons, some numeric functions are deﬁned in   rather than in  .   942  Chapter 17: Numerics  Absolute value of an int value Absolute value of a long  Function Effect abs   labs   llabs   Absolute value of a long long  since C++11  div   ldiv   lldiv   Quotient and remainder of long long division  since C++11  srand   rand    Random-value generator  seed new sequence  Random-value generator  next number of sequence   Quotient and remainder of int division Quotient and remainder of long division  Table17.12. NumericFunctionsoftheHeaderFile    In particular, all numeric functions for integral values are overloaded for types int, long, and long long, whereas all numeric functions for ﬂoating-point values are overloaded for types float, double, and long double.  However, this has an important side effect: When you pass an integral value where only multiple  ﬂoating-point overloads exist, the expression is ambiguous:10  std::sqrt 7      AMBIGUOUS: sqrt float , sqrt double , or     sqrt long double ?  Instead, you have to write  std::sqrt 7.0      OK  or, if you use a variable, you must write  int x; ... std::sqrt float x       OK  Library vendors handle this problem completely differently: Some don’t provide the overloading, some provide standard conforming behavior  overload for all ﬂoating-point types , some overload for all numeric types, and some allow you to switch between different policies by using the preprocessor. Thus, in practice, the ambiguity might or might not occur. To write portable code, you should always write the code in a way that the arguments match exactly.  10 Thanks to David Vandevoorde for pointing this out.   943  17.4 Valarrays  17.4 Valarrays  Purpose of Valarrays  Since C++98, the C++ standard library has provided the class valarray for the processing of arrays of numeric values.  A valarray is a representation of the mathematical concept of a linear sequence of values. It has one dimension, but you can get the illusion of higher dimensionality by special techniques of computed indices and powerful subsetting capabilities. Therefore, a valarray can be used as a base for both vector and matrix operations, as well as for the processing of mathematical systems of polynomial equations with good performance.  Technically, valarrays are one-dimensional arrays with elements numbered sequentially from zero. They provide the ability to do some numeric processing for all or a subset of the values in one or more value arrays. For example, you can process the statement  z = a*x*x + b*x + c  with a, b, c, x, and z being arrays that contain hundreds of numeric values. In doing this, you have the advantage of a simple notation.  Also, the processing is done with good performance because the classes provide some optimiza- tions that avoid the creation of temporary objects while processing the whole statement. These are based on the fact that valarrays are guaranteed to be alias free. That is, any value of a nonconstant valarray is accessed through a unique path. Thus, operations on these values can get optimized bet- ter because the compiler does not have to take into account that the data could be accessed through another path.  In addition, special interfaces and auxiliary classes provide the ability to process only a certain subset of value arrays or to do some multidimensional processing. In this way, the valarray concept also helps to implement vector and matrix operations and classes.  The Problem of Valarrays  The valarray classes were not designed very well. In fact, nobody tried to determine whether the ﬁnal speciﬁcation worked. This happened because nobody felt “responsible” for these classes. The people who introduced valarrays to the C++ standard library left the committee long before the standard was ﬁnished. As a consequence, valarrays are rarely used.  For this reason and due to the thickness of this book, the section that presents class valarry is  provided as a supplementary chapter at http:  www.cppstdlib.com.   This page intentionally left blank    Chapter 18 Concurrency  Modern system architectures usually support running multiple tasks and multiple threads at the same time. Especially when multiple processor cores are provided, the execution time of programs can signiﬁcantly improve when multiple threads are used.  However, executing things in parallel also introduces new challenges. Instead of doing one state- ment after the other, multiple statements can be performed simultaneously, which can result in such problems as concurrently accessing the same resources, so that creations, reads, writes, and dele- tions don’t take place in an expected order and provide unexpected results. In fact, concurrent ac- cess to data from multiple threads easily can become a nightmare, with such problems as deadlocks, whereby threads wait for each other, belonging to the simple cases.  Before C++11, there was no support for concurrency in the language and the C++ standard library, although implementations were free to give some guarantees. With C++11, this has changed. Both the core language and the library were improved to support concurrent programming  see Section 4.5, page 55 :   The core language now deﬁnes a memory model that guarantees that updates on two different objects used by two different threads are independent of each other, and has introduced a new keyword thread_local for deﬁning variables with thread-speciﬁc values.   The library now provides support to start multiple threads, including passing arguments, re- turn values, and exceptions across thread boundaries, as well as means to synchronize multiple threads, so we can synchronize both the control ﬂow and data access.  The library provides its support on different levels. For example, a high-level interface allows you to start a thread including passing arguments and dealing with results and exceptions, which is based on a couple of low-level interfaces for each of these aspects. On the other hand, there are also low-level features, such as mutexes or even atomics dealing with relaxed memory orders.  This chapter introduces these library features. Note that the topic of concurrency and the descrip- tion of the libraries provided for it can ﬁll books. So, here, I introduce general concepts and typical examples for the average application programmer, with the main focus on the high-level interfaces. For any details, especially of the tricky low-level problems and features, please refer to the spe- ciﬁc books and articles mentioned. My ﬁrst and major recommendation for this whole topic of con- currency is the book C++ Concurrency in Action by Anthony Williams  see [Williams:C++Conc] .   946  Chapter 18: Concurrency  Anthony is one of the world key experts on this topic, and this chapter would not have been possi- ble without him. Besides a preview of his book, he provided a ﬁrst implementation of the standard concurrency library  see [JustThread] , wrote several articles, and gave valuable feedback, which all helped me to present this topic in what, hopefully, is a useful way. But in addition, I’d like to thank a few other concurrency experts who helped me to write this chapter: Hans Boehm, Scott Meyers, Bartosz Milewski, Lawrence Crowl, and Peter Sommerlad.   First, I introduce various ways to start multiple threads. After both the high-level and the low-   Section 18.4, page 982, offers a detailed discussion of the problem of synchronizing threads. The   Finally, various features to synchronize threads and concurrent data access are discussed:  level interfaces are introduced, details of starting a thread are presented.  main problem is concurrent data access.  The chapter is organized as follows:  – Mutexes and locks  see Section 18.5, page 989 , including call_once    see Section 18.5.3,  page 1000   – Condition variables  see Section 18.6, page 1003  – Atomics  see Section 18.7, page 1012   18.1 The High-Level Interface: async   and  Futures  For novices, the best starting point to run your program with multiple threads is the high-level inter- face of the C++ standard library provided by std::async   and class std::future :   async   provides an interface to let a piece of functionality, a callable object  see Section 4.4,   Class future  allows you to wait for the thread to be ﬁnished and provides access to its out-  page 54 , run in the background as a separate thread, if possible.  come: return value or exception, if any.  This section introduces this high-level interface in detail, extended by an introduction to class std::shared_future , which allows you to wait for and process the outcome of a thread at multiple places.  18.1.1 A First Example Using async   and Futures  Suppose that we have to compute the sum of two operands returned by two function calls. The usual way to program that would be as follows:  func1   + func2    This means that the processing of the operands happens sequentially. The program will ﬁrst call func1   and then call func2   or the other way round  according to language rules, the order is undeﬁned . In both cases, the overall processing takes the duration of func1   plus the duration of func2   plus computing the sum.   18.1 The High-Level Interface: async   and Futures  947  These days, using the multiprocessor hardware available almost everywhere, we can do better. We can at least try to run func1   and func2   in parallel so that the overall duration takes only the maximum of the duration of func1   and func2   plus processing the sum.     random-number generator  use c as seed to get different sequences  std::default_random_engine dre c ; std::uniform_int_distribution  id 10,1000 ;     loop to print character after a random period of time for  int i=0; i<10; ++i  {  this_thread::sleep_for chrono::milliseconds id dre   ; cout.put c .flush  ;  Here is a ﬁrst program doing that:     concurrency async1.cpp  include   include   include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  int doSomething  char c  {  }  return c;  }  }  }  int func1    {  return doSomething ’.’ ;  int func2    {  return doSomething ’+’ ;  int main   {  std::cout << "starting func1   in background"  << " and func2   in foreground:" << std::endl;   948  Chapter 18: Concurrency     start func1   asynchronously  now or later or never : std::future  result1 std::async func1  ;  int result2 = func2  ;     call func2   synchronously  here and now      print result  wait for func1   to ﬁnish and add its result to result2 int result = result1.get   + result2;  std::cout << "\nresult of func1  +func2  : " << result  << std::endl;  }  To visualize what happens, we simulate the complex processings in func1   and func2   by call- ing doSomething  , which from time to time prints a character passed as argument1 and ﬁnally returns the value of the passed character as int. “From time to time” is implemented using a random-number generator to specify intervals, which std::this_thread::sleep_for   uses as timeouts for the current thread  see Section 17.1, page 907, for details of random numbers, and Section 18.3.7, page 981, for details of sleep_for   . Note that we need a unique seed for the constructor of the random-number generator  here, we use the passed character c  to ensure that the generated random-number sequences differ.  Instead of calling: int result = func1   + func2  ;  we call:  std::future  result1 std::async func1  ; int result2 = func2  ; int result = result1.get   + result2;  So, ﬁrst, we try to start func1   in the background, using std::async  , and assign the result to an object of class std::future:  std::future  result1 std::async func1  ;  Here, async   tries to start the passed functionality immediately asynchronously in a separate thread. Thus, func1   ideally starts here without blocking the main   function. The returned future object is necessary for two reasons: 1.  It allows access to the “future” outcome of the functionality passed to async  . This outcome might be either a return value or an exception. The future object has been specialized by the return type of the functionality started. If just a background task was started that returns nothing it has to be std::future . It is necessary to ensure that sooner or later, the passed functionality gets called. Note that I wrote that async   tries to start the passed functionality. If this didn’t happen we need the future object to force a start when we need the result or want to ensure that the functionality was  2.  1 Output by concurrent threads is possible but might result in interleaved characters  see Section 4.5, page 56 .   18.1 The High-Level Interface: async   and Futures  949  performed. Thus, you need the future object even if you are not interested in the outcome of a functionality started in the background.  To be able to exchange data between the place that starts and controls the functionality and the returned future object, both refer to a so-called shared state  see Section 18.3, page 973 .  Of course, you can also, and usually will, use auto to declare the future  I explicitly wanted to  demonstrate its type here :  auto result1 std::async func1  ;  Second, we start func2   in the foreground. This is a normal synchronous function call so that the program blocks here:  int result2 = func2  ;  Thus, if func1   successfully was started by async   and didn’t end already, we now have func1   and func2   running in parallel.  Third, we process the sum. This is the moment when we need the result of func1  . To get it,  we call get   for the returned future:  int result = result1.get   + result2;  Here, with the call of get  , one of three things might happen: 1.  If func1   was started with async   in a separate thread and has already ﬁnished, you imme- diately get its result. If func1   was started but has not ﬁnished yet, get   blocks and waits for its end and yields the result. If func1   was not started yet, it will be forced to start now and, like a synchronous function call, get   will block until it yields the result.  2.  3.  This behavior is important because it ensures that the program still works on a single-threaded envi- ronment or, if for any other reason, it was not possible for async   to start a new thread.  A call of async   does not guarantee that the passed functionality gets started and ﬁnished. If a thread is available, it will start, but if not — maybe your environment does not support multithreading or no more threads are available — the call will be deferred until you explicitly say that you need its outcome  calling get    or just want the passed functionality to get done  calling wait  ; see Section 18.1.1, page 953 .  Thus, the combination of std::future  result1 std::async func1  ;  and  result1.get    allows you to optimize a program in a way that, if possible, func1   runs in parallel while the next statements in the main thread are processed. If it is not possible to run it in parallel, it will be called sequentially when get   gets called. This means that, in any case, it is guaranteed that after get  , func1   was called either asynchronously or synchronously.  Accordingly, two kinds of outputs are possible for this program. If async   could successfully  start func1  , the output might be something like the following:   950  Chapter 18: Concurrency  starting func1   in background and func2   in foreground: ++..++++.++.+.+. ... result of func1  +func2  : 89  If async   couldn’t start func1  , it will run after func2  , when get   gets called, so that the program will have the following output:  starting func1   in background and func2   in foreground: ++++++++++. ........ result of func1  +func2  : 89  So, based on this ﬁrst example, we can deﬁne a general way to make a program faster: You can modify the program so that it might beneﬁt from parallelization, if the underlying platform supports it, but still works as before on single-threaded environments. For this, you have to do the following:   include     Pass some functionality that could run on its own in parallel as a callable object to std::async     Assign the result to a future  object   Call get   for the future  object when you need the result or want to ensure that the  functionality that was started has ﬁnished  Note, however, that this applies only when no data race occurs, which means that two threads concurrently use the same data resulting in undeﬁned behavior  see Section 18.4.1, page 982 .  Note that without calling get  , there is no guarantee that func1   will ever be called. As written, if async   couldn’t start the passed functionality immediately, it will defer the call so that it gets called only when the outcome of the passed functionality explicitly is requested with get    or wait  ; see page 953 . But without such a request, the termination of main   will even termi- nate the program without ever calling the background thread.  Note also that you have to ensure that you ask for the result of a functionality started with async   no earlier than necessary. For example, the following “optimization” is probably not what you want:  std::future  result1 std::async func1  ; int result = func2   + result1.get  ;     might call func2   after func1   ends  Because the evaluation order on the right side of the second statement is unspeciﬁed, result1.get   might be called before func2   so that you have sequential processing again.  To have the best effect, in general, your goal should be to maximize the distance between calling  async   and calling get  . Or, to use the terms of [N3194:Futures]: Call early and return late.  If the operation passed to async   doesn’t return anything, async   yields a future ,  which is a partial specialization for future . In that case, get   returns nothing:  std::future  f std::async func  ; ... f.get  ;     wait for func to be done  yields void      try to call func asynchronously  Note, ﬁnally, that the object passed to async   may be any type of a callable object: function, member function, function object, or lambda  see Section 4.4, page 54 . Thus, you can also pass the functionality that should run in its own thread inline as a lambda  see Section 3.1.10, page 28 :  std::async []{ ... }      try to perform ... asynchronously   18.1 The High-Level Interface: async   and Futures  951  Using Launch Policies  You can force async   to not defer the passed functionality, by explicitly passing a launch policy2 directing async   that it should deﬁnitely start the passed functionality asynchronously the moment it is called:     force func1   to start asynchronously now or throw std::system_error std::future  result1= std::async std::launch::async, func1 ;  If the asynchronous call is not possible here, the program will throw a std::system_error excep- tion  see Section 4.3.1, page 43  with the error code resource_unavailable_try_again, which is equivalent to the POSIX errno EAGAIN  see Section 4.3.2, page 45 .  With the async launch policy, you don’t necessarily have to call get   anymore because, if the lifetime of the returned future ends, the program will wait for func1   to ﬁnish. Thus, if you don’t call get  , leaving the scope of the future object  here the end of main    will wait for the background task to end. Nevertheless, also calling get   here before a program ends makes the behavior clearer.  If you don’t assign the result of std::async std::launch::async,...  anywhere, the caller will block until the passed functionality has ﬁnished, which would mean that this is nothing but a synchronous call.3  Likewise, you can force a deferred execution by passing std::launch:deferred as launch  policy to async  . In fact, with the following you defer func1   until get   is called for f:  std::future  f std::async std::launch::deferred,  func1  ;     defer func1 until get    Here, it is guaranteed that func1   never gets called without get    or wait  ; see page 953 . This policy especially allows to program lazy evaluation. For example:4 auto f1 = std::async  std::launch::deferred, task1  ; auto f2 = std::async  std::launch::deferred, task2  ; ... auto val = thisOrThatIsTheCase   ? f1.get   : f2.get  ;  In addition, explicitly requesting a deferred launch policy might help to simulate the behavior of async   on a single-threaded environment or simplify debugging  unless race conditions are the problem .  Dealing with Exceptions  So far, we have discussed only the case when threads and background tasks run successfully. How- ever, what happens when an exception occurs?  2 The launch policy is a scoped enumeration, so you have to qualify the values  enumerators  with std::launch or launch  see Section 3.1.13, page 32 . 3 Note that there was some controversial understanding and discussion in the standardization committee about how to interpret the current wording if the result of async   is not used. This was the result of the discussion and should be the behavior of all implementations. 4 Thanks to Lawrence Crowl for pointing this out and providing an example.   952  Chapter 18: Concurrency  The good news is: Nothing special; get   for futures also handles exceptions. In fact, when get   is called and the background operation was or gets terminated by an exception, which was is not handled inside the thread, this exception gets propagated again. As a result, to deal with ex- ceptions of background operations, just do the same with get   as you would do when calling the operation synchronously.  For example, let’s start a background task with an endless loop allocating memory to insert a new  list element:5     concurrency async2.cpp  include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  void task1   {     endless insertion and memory allocation    - will sooner or later raise an exception    - BEWARE: this is bad practice list  v; while  true  {  for  int i=0; i<1000000; ++i  {  v.push_back i ;  } cout.put ’.’ .flush  ;  }  }  int main   {  cout << "starting 2 tasks" << endl; cout << "- task1: process endless loop of memory consumption" << endl; cout   and then for task1" << endl;  auto f1 = async task1 ;     start task1   asynchronously  now or later or never   cin.get  ;     read a character  like getchar     cout << "\nwait for the end of task1: " << endl; try {  5 Trying to consume memory until an exception occurs is bad practice, of course, which on some operating systems might cause trouble. So beware before trying this example out.   18.1 The High-Level Interface: async   and Futures  953  f1.get  ;     wait for task1   to ﬁnish  raises exception if any   } catch  const exception& e  {  cerr << "EXCEPTION: " << e.what   << endl;  }  }  Sooner or later, the endless loop will raise an exception  probably a bad_alloc exception; see Section 4.3.1, page 43 . This exception will terminate the thread because it isn’t caught. The future object will keep this state until get   is called. With get  , the exception gets further propagated inside main  .  Now we can summarize the interface of async   and futures as follows: async   gives a pro- gramming environment the chance to start in parallel some processing that is used later  where get   is called . In other words, if you have some independent functionality f, you can beneﬁt from parallelization, if possible, by passing f to async   the moment you have all you need to call f and replacing the expression where you need the result or outcome of f by a get   for the future returned by async  . Thus, you have the same behavior but the chance of better performance because f might run in parallel before the outcome of f is needed.  Waiting and Polling  You can call get   for a future  only once. After get  , the future is in an invalid state, which can be checked only by calling valid   for the future. Any call other than destruction will result in undeﬁned behavior  see Section 18.3.2, page 975, for details .  But futures also provide an interface to wait for a background operation to ﬁnish without process- ing its outcome. This interface is callable more than once and might be combined with a duration or timepoint to limit the amount of waiting time.  Just calling wait   forces the start of a thread a future represents and waits for the termination  of the background operation:  std::future  f std::async func  ; ... f.wait  ;     wait for func to be done  might start background task      try to call func asynchronously  Two other wait   functions exist for futures, but those functions do not force the thread to get started, if it hasn’t started yet: 1. With wait_for  , you can wait for a limited time for an asynchronously running operation by  passing a duration:  std::future  f std::async func  ; ... f.wait_for std::chrono::seconds 10  ;     try to call func asynchronously     wait at most 10 seconds for func  2. With wait_until  , you can wait until a speciﬁc timepoint has reached:  std::future  f std::async func  ; ... f.wait_until std::system_clock::now  +std::chrono::minutes 1  ;     try to call func asynchronously   954  Chapter 18: Concurrency  or get   have yet forced it to start  both function return immediately in this case   Both wait_for   and wait_until   return one of the following:   std::future_status::deferred if async   deferred the operation and no calls to wait     std::future_status::timeout if the operation was started asynchronously but hasn’t ﬁn-   std::future_status::ready if the operation has ﬁnished Using wait_for   or wait_until   especially allows to program so-called speculative execution. For example, consider a scenario where we must have a usable result of a computation within a certain time, and it would be nice to have an accurate answer:6  ished yet  if the waiting expired due to the passed timeout   int quickComputation  ; int accurateComputation  ;     process result ‘‘quick and dirty’’    process result ‘‘accurate but slow’’  std::future  f;     outside declared because lifetime of accurateComputation      might exceed lifetime of bestResultInTime    int bestResultInTime   {     deﬁne time slot to get the answer: auto tp = std::chrono::system_clock::now   + std::chrono::minutes 1 ;     start both a quick and an accurate computation: f = std::async  std::launch::async, accurateComputation ; int guess = quickComputation  ;     give accurate computation the rest of the time slot: std::future_status s = f.wait_until tp ;     return the best computation result we have: if  s == std::future_status::ready  {  return f.get  ;  return guess;     accurateComputation   continues  } else {  }  }  Note that the future f can’t be a local object declared inside bestResultInTime   because when the time was too short to ﬁnish accurateComputation   the destructor of the future would block until that asynchronous task has ﬁnished.  By passing a zero duration or a timepoint that has passed, you can simply “poll” to see whether  a background task has started and or is  still  running:  future  f async task  ; ...     try to call task asynchronously  6 Thanks to Lawrence Crowl for pointing this out and providing an example.   18.1 The High-Level Interface: async   and Futures  955     do something while task has not ﬁnished  might never happen!  while  f.wait_for chrono::seconds 0  != future_status::ready   {  ...  }  Note, however, that such a loop might never end, because, for example, on single-threaded en- vironments, the call will be deferred until get   is called. So you either should call async   with the std::launch::async launch policy passed as ﬁrst argument or check explicitly whether wait_for   returns std::future_status::deferred:  future  f async task  ; ...    check whether task was deferred: if  f.wait_for chrono::seconds 0   != future_status::deferred  {     try to call task asynchronously     do something while task has not ﬁnished while  f.wait_for chrono::seconds 0  != future_status::ready   {  ...  }  } ... auto r = f.get  ;     force execution of task and wait for result  or exception   Another reason for an endless loop here might be that the thread executing the loop has the processor and the other threads are not getting any time to make the future ready. This can reduce the speed of programs dramatically. The quickest ﬁx is to call yield    see Section 18.3.7, page 981  inside the loop:  std::this_thread::yield  ; and or sleep for a short period of time.     hint to reschedule to the next thread  See Section 5.7, page 143, for details of durations and timepoints, which can be passed as argu- ments to wait_for   and wait_until  . Note that wait_for   and wait_until   usually will differ when dealing with system-time adjustments  see Section 5.7.5, page 160, for details .  18.1.2 An Example of Waiting for Two Tasks  This third program demonstrates a few of the abilities just mentioned:     concurrency async3.cpp  include   include   include   include   include   include   using namespace std;   956  Chapter 18: Concurrency  void doSomething  char c  {     random-number generator  use c as seed to get different sequences  default_random_engine dre c ; uniform_int_distribution  id 10,1000 ;     loop to print character after a random period of time for  int i=0; i<10; ++i  {  this_thread::sleep_for chrono::milliseconds id dre   ; cout.put c .flush  ;  }  }  int main   {  cout << "starting 2 operations asynchronously" << endl;     start two loops in the background printing characters . or + auto f1 = async []{ doSomething ’.’ ; } ; auto f2 = async []{ doSomething ’+’ ; } ;     if at least one of the background tasks is running if  f1.wait_for chrono::seconds 0   != future_status::deferred  f2.wait_for chrono::seconds 0   != future_status::deferred  {    poll until at least one of the loops ﬁnished while  f1.wait_for chrono::seconds 0   != future_status::ready && f2.wait_for chrono::seconds 0   != future_status::ready  {  ...; this_thread::yield  ;     hint to reschedule to the next thread  }  } cout.put ’\n’ .flush  ;     wait for all loops to be ﬁnished and process any exception try {  f1.get  ; f2.get  ;  } catch  const exception& e  {  } cout << "\ndone" << endl;  }  cout << "\nEXCEPTION: " << e.what   << endl;   18.1 The High-Level Interface: async   and Futures  957  Again, we have an operation doSomething   that from time to time prints a character passed as argument  see Section 18.1.1, page 948 .  Now, with async  , we start doSomething   twice in the background, printing two different  characters using different delays generated by the corresponding random-number sequences:  auto f1 = std::async []{ doSomething ’.’ ; } ; auto f2 = std::async []{ doSomething ’+’ ; } ;  Again, in multithreading environments, there would now be two operations simultaneously running that “from time to time” print different characters.  Next, we “poll” to see whether one of the two operations has ﬁnished:7 while  f1.wait_for chrono::seconds 0   != future_status::ready && f2.wait_for chrono::seconds 0   != future_status::ready  {  ... this_thread::yield  ;     hint to reschedule to the next thread  However, because this loop would never end if neither of the tasks were launched in the background when async   was called, we ﬁrst have to check whether at least one operation was not deferred:  if  f1.wait_for chrono::seconds 0   != future_status::deferred  f2.wait_for chrono::seconds 0   != future_status::deferred  {  Alternatively, we could call async   with the std::launch:async launch policy.  When at least one background operation has ﬁnished or none of them was started, we write a  newline character and then wait for both loops to end:  }  }  ...  f1.get  ; f2.get  ;  We use get   here to process any exception that might have occurred.  In a multithreading environment, the program might, for example, have the following output: starting 2 operations asynchronously ++.++..+.+..++.+.+ .. done  Note that regarding the order of all three characters ., +, and newline, nothing is guaranteed. It might be typical that the ﬁrst character is a dot because this is the output from the ﬁrst operation started — thus, started a little bit earlier — but as you can see here, a + might also come ﬁrst. The characters . and + might be mixed, but this also is not guaranteed. In fact, if you remove the sleep_for   statement, which enforces the delay between each printing of the passed character, the ﬁrst loop is done before the ﬁrst context switch to the other thread, so the output might more likely become:  7 Without doing something useful inside the loop, this would just be busy waiting, which means that the problem would be better solved with condition variables  see Section 18.6.1, page 1003 .   958  Chapter 18: Concurrency  starting 2 operations asynchronously ......... ++++++++++ done  This output will also result if the environment doesn’t support multithreading, because in that case, both calls of doSomething   will be called synchronously with the calls of get  .  Also, it is not clear when the newline character gets printed. This might happen before any oth- er characters are written if the execution of both background tasks is deferred until get   is called. Then the deferred tasks will be called one after the other:  starting 2 operations asynchronously  .........++++++++++ done  The only thing we know is that newline won’t be printed before one of the loops has ﬁnished. It is not even guaranteed that newline comes directly after the last character of one of the sequences, because it might take some time until the end of one of the loops is recorded in the corresponding future object and this recorded state is evaluated  note that this is not real-time processing . For this reason, you might have an output where a couple of + characters are written after the last dot and before the newline character:  starting 2 operations asynchronously .+..+..+..+.+..++ +++ done  Passing Arguments  The previous example demonstrated one way to pass arguments to a background task: You simply use a lambda  see Section 3.1.10, page 28 , which calls the background functionality:  auto f1 = std::async []{ doSomething ’.’ ; } ;  Of course, you can also pass arguments that existed before the async   statement. As usual, you can pass them by value or by reference:  char c = ’@’; auto f = std::async [=]{  } ;     =: can access objects in scope by value  doSomething c ;     pass copy of c to doSomething    By deﬁning the capture as [=], you pass a copy of c and all other visible objects to the lambda, so inside the lambda you can pass this copy of c to doSomething  .  However, there are other ways to pass arguments to async   because async   provides the usual interface for callable objects  see Section 4.4, page 54 . For example, if you pass a function pointer as the ﬁrst argument to async  , you can pass multiple additional arguments, which are passed as parameters to the function called:   18.1 The High-Level Interface: async   and Futures  959  char c = ’@’; auto f = std::async doSomething,c ;     call doSomething c  asynchronously  You can also pass arguments by reference, but the risk of doing so is that the values passed become invalid before the background task even starts. This applies to both lambdas and functions directly called:  char c = ’@’; auto f = std::async [&]{ doSomething c ; } ;     risky!  char c = ’@’; auto f = std::async doSomething,std::ref c  ;     risky!  If you control the lifetime of the argument passed so that it exceeds the background task, you can do it. For example:     pass character by reference  void doSomething  const char& c ; ... char c = ’@’; auto f = std::async [&]{ doSomething c ; } ; ... f.get  ;     needs lifetime of c until here     pass c by reference  But beware: If you pass arguments by reference to be able to modify them from a separate thread, you can easily run into undeﬁned behavior. Consider the following example where after trying to start an output loop for printing a character in the background you switch the character printed:     pass character by reference  void doSomething  const char& c ; ... char c = ’@’; auto f = std::async [&]{ doSomething c ; } ; ... c = ’_’; f.get  ;     switch output of doSomething   to underscores, if it still runs    needs lifetime of c until here     pass c by reference  First, the order of accessing c here and in doSomething   is undeﬁned. Thus, the switch of the output character might come before, in the middle of, or after the output loop. Even worse, because we modify c in one thread and another thread reads c, this is a nonsynchronized concurrent access to the same object  a so-called data race, see Section 18.4.1, page 982 , which results in undeﬁned behavior unless you protect the concurrent access by using mutexes  see Section 18.5, page 989  or atomics  see Section 18.7, page 1012 .  So, let me make clear: If you start to use async  , you should pass all objects necessary to process the passed functionality by value so that async   uses only local copies. If copying is too expensive, ensure that the objects are passed as constant reference and that mutable is not used. In any other case, read Section 18.4, page 982, and make sure that you understand the implications of your approach.  You can also pass a pointer to a member function to async  . In that case, the ﬁrst argument after the member function has to be a reference or a pointer to the object for which the member function gets called:   960  Chapter 18: Concurrency  class X {  public:  }; ...  void mem  int num ; ...  X x; auto a = std::async &X::mem, x, 42 ; ...     try to call x.mem 42  asynchronously  18.1.3 Shared Futures  As we have seen, class std::future provides the ability to process the future outcome of a concur- rent computation. However, you can process this outcome only once. A second call of get   results in undeﬁned behavior  according to the C++ standard library, implementations are encouraged but not required to throw a std::future_error .  However, it sometimes makes sense to process the outcome of a concurrent computation more than once, especially when multiple other threads process this outcome. For this purpose, the C++ standard library provides class std::shared_future. Here, multiple get   calls are possible and yield the same result or throw the same exception.  Consider the following example:     concurrency sharedfuture1.cpp  include   include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  int queryNumber    {     read number cout << "read number: "; int num; cin >> num;     throw exception if none if  !cin  {  throw runtime_error "no number read" ;   18.1 The High-Level Interface: async   and Futures  961  void doSomething  char c, shared_future  f  {  try {     wait for number of characters to print int num = f.get  ;     get result of queryNumber    for  int i=0; i<num; ++i  {  this_thread::sleep_for chrono::milliseconds 100  ; cout.put c .flush  ;  }  } catch  const exception& e  {  cerr << "EXCEPTION in thread " << this_thread::get_id    << ": " << e.what   << endl;  }  }  return num;  }  }  int main   {  try {     start one thread to query a number shared_future  f = async queryNumber ;     start three threads each processing this number in a loop auto f1 = async launch::async,doSomething,’.’,f ; auto f2 = async launch::async,doSomething,’+’,f ; auto f3 = async launch::async,doSomething,’*’,f ;     wait for all loops to be ﬁnished f1.get  ; f2.get  ; f3.get  ;  } catch  const exception& e  {  } cout << "\ndone" << endl;  }  cout << "\nEXCEPTION: " << e.what   << endl;   962  Chapter 18: Concurrency  In this example, one thread calls queryNumber   to query an integral value, which is then used by other threads already running. To perform this task, the result of std::async  , which starts the query thread, gets assigned to a shared_future object, specialized for the return value:  shared_future  f = async queryNumber ;  Thus, a shared future can be initialized by an ordinary future, which moves the state from the future to the shared future. To be able to use auto for this declaration, you can, alternatively, use the share   member function:  auto f = async queryNumber .share  ;  Internally, all shared future objects share the shared state, which async   creates to store the out- come of the passed functionality  and store the functionality itself if it is deferred .  The shared future is then passed to the other threads, starting doSomething   with the shared  future as second argument:  auto f1 = async launch::async,doSomething,’.’,f ; auto f2 = async launch::async,doSomething,’+’,f ; auto f3 = async launch::async,doSomething,’*’,f ;  Inside each call of doSomething  , we wait for and process the result of queryNumber   by calling get   for the shared future passed:  void doSomething  char c, shared_future  f  {  try {  int num = f.get  ; ...  } catch  const exception& e  {     get result of queryNumber    cerr << "EXCEPTION in thread " << this_thread::get_id    << ": " << e.what   << endl;  If queryNumber   throws an exception, which happens if no integral value could be read, each call of doSomething   will get this exception with f.get  , so that the corresponding exception handling will occur.  }  }  done  Thus, after reading the value 5 as input, the output might be: read number: 5 *+.*+.*.+*+.*.+ done  But if typing ’x’ as input, the output might be:  read number: x EXCEPTION in thread 3: no number read EXCEPTION in thread 4: no number read EXCEPTION in thread 2: no number read   18.1 The High-Level Interface: async   and Futures  963  Note that the order of the thread outputs and the ID values are undeﬁned  see Section 18.2.1, page 967, for details about thread IDs .  Also note that there is a minor difference in the declaration of get   between future and  shared_future:   For class future , get   is provided as follows  T is the type of the returned value :  T future ::get  ; T& future ::get  ; void future ::get  ;     general get      specialization for references    specialization for void  where the ﬁrst form returns the moved result or a copy of the result.    For class shared_future , get   is provided as follows:  const T& shared_future ::get  ; T& shared_future ::get  ; void shared_future ::get  ;     general get      specialization for references    specialization for void  where the ﬁrst form returns a reference to the result value stored in the shared shared state.  Or, as [N3194:Futures] states: “The single-use value get   is move optimized  e.g., std::vector  v = f.get    . ... The const reference get   is access optimized  e.g., int i = f.get  [3]  .” This design introduces the risk of lifetime or data race issues if returned values are modiﬁed  see Section 18.3.3, page 977, for details .  You could also pass a shared future by reference  that is, declare it as reference and use  std::ref   to pass it :  void doSomething  char c, const shared_future & f  auto f1 = async launch::async,doSomething,’.’,std::ref f  ;  Now, instead of using multiple shared future objects all sharing the same shared state, you’d use one shared future object to perform multiple get  ’s  one in each thread . However, this approach is more risky. As a programmer you have to ensure that the lifetime of f  yes, f, not the shared state it refers to  is not smaller than for the threads started. In addition, note that the member functions of shared futures do not synchronize with themselves, although the shared shared state is synchronized. So, if you do more than just read data, you might need external synchronization techniques  see Sec- tion 18.4, page 982  to avoid data races, which would result in undeﬁned behavior. Or as Lawrence Crowl, one of the authors of the concurrency library, wrote in a private communication: “If the code stays tightly coordinated, passing by reference is ﬁne. If the code may propagate into regions with an incomplete understanding of the purpose and restrictions, passing by value is better. Copying the shared future is expensive, but not so expensive as to justify a latent bug in a large system.”  For further details of class shared_future see Section 18.3.3, page 976.   964  Chapter 18: Concurrency  18.2 The Low-Level Interface: Threads and Promises  Besides the high-level interface of async   and  shared  futures, the C++ standard library provides a low-level interface to start threads and deal with them.  18.2.1 Class std::thread  To start a thread, you simply have to declare an object of class std::thread and pass the desired task as initial argument, and then either wait for its end or detach it:  void doSomething  ;  std::thread t doSomething ; ... t.join  ;     wait for t to ﬁnish  block until doSomething   ends      start doSomething   in the background  As for async  , you can pass anything that’s a callable object  function, member function, function object, lambda; see Section 4.4, page 54  together with possible additional arguments. However, note again that unless you really know what you are doing, you should pass all objects necessary to process the passed functionality by value so that the thread uses only local copies  see Section 18.4, page 982, for some of the problems that might occur otherwise .  is a unique thread ID  see Section 18.2.1, page 967 .  In addition, this is a low-level interface, so the interesting thing is what this interface does not provide compared to async    see Section 18.1, page 946 :   Class thread doesn’t have a launch policy. The C++ standard library always tries to start the passed functionality in a new thread. If this isn’t possible, it throws a std::system_error  see Section 4.3.1, page 43  with the error code resource_unavailable_try_again  see Sec- tion 4.3.2, page 45 .   You have no interface to process the result or outcome of the thread. The only thing you can get   If an exception occurs that is not caught inside the thread, the program immediately aborts, call- ing std::terminate    see Section 5.8.2, page 162 . To pass exceptions to a context outside the thread exception_ptrs  see Section 4.3.3, page 52  have to be used.   You have to declare whether, as a caller, you want to wait for the end of the thread  calling join    or to detach from the thread started to let it run in the background without any control  calling detach   . If you don’t do this before the lifetime of the thread object ends or a move assignment to it happens, the program aborts, calling std::terminate    see Section 5.8.2, page 162 .   If you let the thread run in the background and main   ends, all threads are terminated abruptly.  Here is a ﬁrst complete example:     concurrency thread1.cpp  include   include     18.2 The Low-Level Interface: Threads and Promises  965  include   include   include   using namespace std;  void doSomething  int num, char c  {  try {     random-number generator  use c as seed to get different sequences  default_random_engine dre 42*c ; uniform_int_distribution  id 10,1000 ; for  int i=0; i<num; ++i  {  this_thread::sleep_for chrono::milliseconds id dre   ; cout.put c .flush  ; ...  }  }    make sure no exception leaves the thread and terminates the program catch  const exception& e  {  cerr << "THREAD-EXCEPTION  thread "  << this_thread::get_id   << " : " << e.what   << endl;  } catch  ...  {  cerr << "THREAD-EXCEPTION  thread "  << this_thread::get_id   << " " << endl;  }  }  int main   {  try {  thread t1 doSomething,5,’.’ ; cout << "- started fg thread " << t1.get_id   << endl;     print ﬁve dots in separate thread     print other characters in other background threads for  int i=0; i<5; ++i  {  thread t doSomething,10,’a’+i ;    print 10 chars in separate thread cout << "- detach started bg thread " << t.get_id   << endl; t.detach  ;     detach thread into the background  }  cin.get  ;     wait for any input  return    966  Chapter 18: Concurrency  cout << "- join fg thread " << t1.get_id   << endl; t1.join  ;     wait for t1 to ﬁnish  } catch  const exception& e  {  cerr << "EXCEPTION: " << e.what   << endl;  }  }  Here, in main  , we start a couple of threads that perform the statements of doSomething  . Both main   and doSomething   have corresponding try-catch clauses for the following reasons:   In main  , creating a thread might throw a std::system_error  see Section 4.3.1, page 43    In doSomething  , started as std::thread, any uncaught exception would cause the program  with the error code resource_unavailable_try_again.  to terminate.  For the ﬁrst thread started in main  , we later wait for it to ﬁnish:  thread t1 doSomething,5,’.’ ; ... t1.join  ;     wait for t1 to ﬁnish     print ﬁve dots in separate thread  The other threads are detached after they were started, so they still might be running at the end of main  :  for  int i=0; i<5; ++i  {  thread t doSomething,10,’a’+i ; t.detach  ;     print 10 chars in separate thread    detach thread into the background  }  As a consequence, the program would immediately terminate all background threads when main   ends, which is the case when, due to cin.get  , some input could be read, and due to t1.join  , the ﬁfth dot as last character of the thread performing doSomething 5,’.’  was written. Because the waiting for the input and the printing of the dots run in parallel, it doesn’t matter what happens ﬁrst.  For example, the program might have the following output if I press Return after the second dot  was printed:  - started fg thread 1 - detach started bg thread 2 - detach started bg thread 3 - detach started bg thread 4 - detach started bg thread 5 - detach started bg thread 6 ecad.dbcebabd.a - join fg thread 1 b.ceade.bbcadbe.   18.2 The Low-Level Interface: Threads and Promises  967  Beware of Detached Threads  Detached threads can easily become a problem if they use nonlocal resources. The problem is that you lose control of a detached thread and have no easy way to ﬁnd out whether and how long it runs. Thus, make sure that a detached thread does not access any objects after their lifetime has ended. For this reason, passing variables and objects to a thread by reference is always a risk. Passing arguments by value is strongly recommended.  Note, however, that the lifetime problem also applies to global and static objects, because when the program exits, the detached thread might still run, which means that it might access global or static objects that are already destroyed or under destruction. Unfortunately, this would result in undeﬁned behavior.8   Detached threads should prefer to access local copies only.   If a detached thread uses a global or static object, you should do one of the following:  So, as a general rule for detached threads, take into account the following:  – Ensure that these global static objects are not destroyed before all detached threads accessing them are ﬁnished  or ﬁnished accessing them . One approach to ensure this is to use condition variables  see Section 18.6, page 1003 , which the detached threads use to signal that they have ﬁnished. Before leaving main   or calling exit  , you’d have to set these condition variables then to signal that a destruction is possible.9  – End the program by calling quick_exit  , which was introduced exactly for this reason to end a program without calling the destructors for global and static objects  see Section 5.8.2, page 162 .  Because std::cin, std::cout, and std::cerr and the other global stream objects  see Sec- tion 15.2.2, page 751  according to the standard “are not destroyed during program execution,” access to these objects in detached threads should introduce no undeﬁned behavior. However, other problems, such as interleaved characters, might occur.  Nevertheless, as a rule of thumb keep in mind that the only safe way to terminate a detached thread is with one of the “...at_thread_exit  ” functions, which force the main thread to wait for the detached thread to truly ﬁnish. Or you can just ignore this feature, according to a reviewer who wrote: “Detached threads is one of those things that should be moved into the chapter on dangerous features that almost no one needs.”  Thread IDs  As you can see, the program prints thread IDs provided either by the thread object or inside a thread, using namespace this_thread  also provided by   :  void doSomething  int num, char c  {  ...  8 Thanks to Hans Boehm and Anthony Williams for pointing out this problem. 9 Ideally, you should use notify_all_at_thread_exit    see Section 18.6.4, page 1011  to set the condition variable to ensure that all thread local variables are destructed.   968  ...  }  cerr << "THREAD-EXCEPTION  thread "  << this_thread::get_id   << " " << endl;  Chapter 18: Concurrency  thread t doSomething,5,’.’ ; cout << "- started fg thread " << t1.get_id   << endl;     print ﬁve dots in separate thread  This ID is a special type std::thread::id, which is guaranteed to be unique for each thread. In addition, class id has a default constructor that yields a unique ID representing “no thread”:  std::cout << "ID of \"no thread\": " << std::thread::id    << std::endl;  The only operations allowed for thread IDs are comparisons and calling the output operator for a stream. You should not make any further assumptions, such as that “no thread” has ID 0 or the main thread has ID 1. In fact, an implementation might generate these IDs on the ﬂy when they are requested, not when the threads are started, so the number of the main thread depends on the number of requests for thread IDs before. So, the following code:  std::thread t1 doSomething,5,’.’ ; std::thread t2 doSomething,5,’+’ ; std::thread t3 doSomething,5,’*’ ; std::cout << "t3 ID: std::cout << "main ID: std::cout << "nothread ID: " << std::thread::id   << std::endl;  " << t3.get_id   << std::endl; " << std::this_thread::get_id   << std::endl;  might print: 1 t3 ID: main ID: 4 nothread ID: 0  or:  or:  3 t3 ID: main ID: 4 nothread ID: 0  1 t3 ID: main ID: 2 nothread ID: 3  Thus, the only way to identify a thread, such as a master thread, is to compare it to its saved ID  or even characters as thread IDs.  when it was started:  std::thread::id masterThreadID;   18.2 The Low-Level Interface: Threads and Promises  969  if  std::this_thread::get_id   == masterThreadID  {  void doSomething   {  ...  } ...  }  std::thread master doSomething ; masterThreadID = master.get_id  ; ... std::thread slave doSomething ; ...  Note that IDs of terminated threads might be reused again.  For further details of class thread, see Section 18.3.6, page 979.  18.2.2 Promises  Now the question arises as to how you can pass parameters and handle exceptions between threads  which also explains how a high-level interface, such as async  , is implemented . Of course, to pass values to a thread, you can simply pass them as arguments. And if you need a result, you can pass return arguments by reference, just as described for async    see Section 18.1.2, page 958 .  However, another general mechanism is provided to pass result values and exceptions as out- comes of a thread: class std::promise. A promise object is the counterpart of a future object. Both are able to temporarily hold a shared state, representing a  result  value or an exception. While the future object allows you to retrieve the data  using get   , the promise object enables you to provide the data  by using one of its set_...   functions . The following example demonstrates this:     concurrency promise1.cpp  include   include   include   include   include   include   include   include    void doSomething  std::promise & p  {  try {     read character and throw exceptiopn if ’x’   970  Chapter 18: Concurrency  std::cout << "read char  ’x’ for exception : "; char c = std::cin.get  ; if  c == ’x’  {  throw std::runtime_error std::string "char " +c+" read" ;  } ... std::string s = std::string "char "  + c + " processed"; p.set_value std::move s  ;     store result  p.set_exception std::current_exception   ;     store exception  } catch  ...  {  }  }  int main   {  try {     start thread using a promise to store the outcome std::promise  p; std::thread t doSomething,std::ref p  ; t.detach  ; ...     create a future to process the outcome std::future  f p.get_future   ;     process the outcome std::cout << "result: " << f.get   << std::endl;  } catch  const std::exception& e  {  std::cerr << "EXCEPTION: " << e.what   << std::endl;  } catch  ...  {  }  }  std::cerr << "EXCEPTION " << std::endl;  After including  , where promises also are declared, you can declare a promise object, specialized for the value to hold or return  or void if none :  std::promise  p;     hold string result or exception   18.2 The Low-Level Interface: Threads and Promises  971  The promise internally creates a shared state  see Section 18.3, page 973 , which can be used here to store a value of the corresponding type or an exception, and can be used in a future object to retrieve this data as the outcome of the thread.  This promise is then passed to a task running as a separate thread: std::thread t doSomething,std::ref p  ;  By using std::ref    see Section 5.4.3, page 132 , we ensure that the promise is passed by refer- ence so that we can manipulate its state  copying is not possible for promises .  Now, inside the thread, we can store either a value or an exception by calling set_value   or  set_exception  , respectively:  void doSomething  std::promise & p  {  try { ... p.set_value std::move s  ;     store result  } catch  ...  {  }  }  p.set_exception std::current_exception   ;     store exception  To store an exception, the convenience function std::current_exception  , which is deﬁned in  , is used  see Section 4.3.3, page 52 . It yields the currently handled exception as type std::exception_ptr or nullptr if we currently do not handle an exception. The promise object stores this exception internally.  The moment we store a value or an exception in a shared state, it becomes ready. Thus, you can now retrieve its value somewhere else. But for the retrieval, we need a corresponding future object sharing the same shared state. For this reason, inside main  , by calling get_future   for the promise object we create a future object, which has the usual semantics introduced in Section 18.1, page 946. We could also have created the future object before starting the thread:  std::future  f p.get_future   ;  Now, with get  , we either get the stored result or the stored exception gets rethrown  internally, calling std::rethrow_exception   for the stored exception_ptr :  f.get  ;     process the outcome of the thread  Note that get   blocks until the shared state is ready, which is exactly the case when set_value   or set_exception   was performed for the promise. It does not mean that the thread setting the promise has ended. The thread might still perform other statements, such as even store additional outcomes into other promises.  If you want the shared state to become ready when the thread really ends — to ensure the cleanup of thread local objects and other stuff before the result gets processed — you have to call set_value_at_thread_exit   or set_exception_at_thread_exit   instead:  void doSomething  std::promise & p  {   972  Chapter 18: Concurrency  try { ... p.set_value_at_thread_exit std::move s  ;  } catch  ...  {  }  }  p.set_exception_at_thread_exit std::current_exception   ;  Note that using promises and futures is not limited to multithreading problems. Even in single- threaded applications, we could use a promise to hold a result value or an exception that we want to process later by using a future.  Note also that we can’t store both a value and an exception. Any attempt to do this would result in a std::future_error with the error code std::future_errc::promise_already_satisfied  see Section 4.3.1, page 43 .  For further details of class promise, see Section 18.3.4, page 977.  18.2.3 Class packaged_task   async   gives you a handle to deal with the outcome of a task that you try to start immediately in the background. Sometimes, however, you need to process the outcome of a background task that you don’t necessarily start immediately. For example, another instance, such as a thread pool, might control when and how many background tasks run simultaneously. In this case, instead of  double compute  int x, int y ;  std::future  f = std::async compute,7,5 ;    try to start a background task ... double res = f.get  ;     wait for its end and process result exception  you can program:  double compute  int x, int y ;  std::packaged_task  task compute ; std::future  f = task.get_future  ; ... task 7,5 ; ... double res = f.get  ;     wait for its end and process result exception     start the task  typically in a separate thread      create a task    get its future  where the task itself is usually, but not necessarily, started in a separate thread.  Thus, class std::packaged_task , also deﬁned in  , holds both the functionality to perform and its possible outcome  the so-called shared state of the functionality; see Section 18.3, page 973 .  For further details of class packaged_task, see Section 18.3.5, page 977.   18.3 Starting a Thread in Detail  973  18.3 Starting a Thread in Detail  Having introduced the high- and low-level interfaces to  possibly  start threads and deal with return values or exceptions, let’s summarize the concepts and provide some details not mentioned yet.

LayersofThreadInterfaces  Conceptionally, we have the following layers to start threads and deal with their return values or exceptions  see Figure 18.1 :   With the low-level interface of class thread, we can start a thread. To return data, we need shared variables  global or static or passed as argument . To return exceptions, we could use the type std::exception_ptr, which is returned by std::current_exception   and can be processed by std::rethrow_exception    see Section 4.3.3, page 52 .   The concept of a shared state allows us to deal with return values or exceptions in a more conve- nient way. With the low-level interface of a promise, we can create such a shared state, which we can process by using a future.   At a higher level, with class packaged_task or async  , the shared state is automatically   With packaged_task, we can create an object with a shared state where we explicitly have to   With std::async  , we don’t have to care when the thread exactly gets started. The only thing  created and set with a return statement or an uncaught exception.  program when to start the thread.  we know is that we have to call get   when we need the outcome.  Shared States  As you can see, a central concept used by almost all these features is a shared state. It allows the objects that start and control a background functionality  a promise, a packaged task, or async    to   974  Chapter 18: Concurrency  communicate with the objects that process its outcome  a future or a shared future . Thus, a shared state is able to hold the functionality to start, some state information, and its outcome  a return value or an exception .  A shared state is ready when it holds the outcome of its functionality  when a value or an excep- tion is ready for retrieval . A shared state is usually implemented as a reference-counted object that gets destroyed when the last object referring to it releases it.  18.3.1 async   in Detail  In general, as introduced in Section 18.1, page 946, std::async   is a convenience function to start some functionality in its own thread if possible. As a result, you can parallelize functionality if the underlying platform supports it but not lose any functionality if it doesn’t.  However, the exact behavior of async   is complex and highly depends on the launch policy, which can be passed as the ﬁrst optional argument. For this reason, each of the three standardized forms of how async   can be called as described here from an application programmer’s point of view:  future async  std::launch::async, F func, args...    Tries to start func with args as an asynchronous task  parallel thread .   If this is not possible, it throws an exception of type std::system_error with the error code   Unless the program aborts, the started thread is guaranteed to ﬁnish before the program ends.   The thread will ﬁnish:  std::errc::resource_unavailable_try_again  see Section 4.3.1, page 43 .  – If get   or wait   is called for the returned future – If the last object that refers to the shared state represented by the returned future gets   This implies that the call of async   will block until func has ﬁnished if the return value of  destructed  async   is not used.  future async  std::launch::deferred, F func, args...    Passes func with args as a “deferred” task, which gets synchronously called when wait   or   If neither wait   nor get   is called, the task will never start.  get   for the returned future gets called.  future async  F func, args...    Is a combination of calling async   with launch policies std::launch:async and std::launch::deferred. According to the current situation, one of the two forms gets cho- sen. Thus, async   will defer the call of func if an immediate call in async launch policy is not possible.   Thus, if async   can start a new thread for func, it gets started. Otherwise, func is deferred until  get   or wait   gets called for the returned future.   18.3 Starting a Thread in Detail  975  func will have been called and ﬁnished.    The only guarantee this call gives is that after calling get   or wait   for the returned future,   Without calling get   or wait   for the returned future, func might never get called.   Note that this form of async   will not throw a system_error exception if it can’t call func  asynchronously  it might throw a system error for other reasons, though .  For all these forms of async  , func might be a callable object  function, member function, function object, lambda; see Section 4.4, page 54 . See Section 18.1.2, page 958, for some examples.  Passing a launch policy of std::launch::asyncstd::launch::deferred to async   re- sults in the same behavior as passing no launching policy. Passing 0 as launch policy results in undeﬁned behavior  this case is not covered by the C++ standard library, and different implementa- tions behave differently .  18.3.2 Futures in Detail  Class future ,10 introduced in Section 18.1, page 946, represents the outcome of an operation. It can be a return value or an exception but not both. The outcome is managed in a shared state, which in general can be created by std::async  , a std::packaged_task, or a promise. The outcome might not exist yet; thus, the future might also hold everything necessary to generate the outcome.  If the future was returned by async    see Section 18.3.1, page 974  and the associated task was deferred, get   or wait   will start it synchronously. Note that wait_for   and wait_until   do not start a deferred task.  The outcome can be retrieved only once. For this reason, a future might have a valid or invalid state: valid means that there is an associated operation for which the result or exception was not retrieved yet.  Table 18.1 lists the operations available for class future . Note that the return value of get   depends on the type future  is specialized with:   If it is void, get   also has type void and returns nothing.   If the future is parametrized with a reference type, get   returns a reference to the return value.   Otherwise, get   returns a copy or move assigns the return value, depending on whether the  return type supports move assignment semantics.  Note that you can call get   only once, because get   invalidates the future’s state.  For a future that has an invalid state, calling anything else but the destructor, the move as- signment operator, or valid   results in undeﬁned behavior. For this case, the standard recom- mends throwing an exception of type future_error  see Section 4.3.1, page 43  with the code std::future_errc::no_state, but this is not required.  Note that neither a copy constructor nor a copy assignment operator is provided, ensuring that no two objects can share the state of a background operation. You can move the state to another future object only by calling the move constructor or the move assignment operator. However, the state  10 Originally, the class was named unique_future in the standardization process.   976  Chapter 18: Concurrency  Operation future f future f rv   f.~future   f = rv  f.valid    f.get    f.wait    f.wait_for dur   Effect Default constructor; creates a future with an invalid state Move constructor; creates a new future, which gets the state of rv, and invalidates the state of rv Destroys the state and destroys *this Move assignment; destroys the old state of f, gets the state of rv, and invalidates the state of rv Yields true if f has a valid state, so you can call the following member functions Blocks until the background operation is done  forcing a deferred associated functionality to start synchronously , yields the result  if any  or raises any exception that occurred, and invalidates its state Blocks until the background operation is done  forcing a deferred associated functionality to start synchronously  Blocks for duration dur or until the background operation is done  a deferred thread is not forced to start   f.wait_until tp  Blocks until timepoint tp or until the background operation  f.share    is done  a deferred thread is not forced to start  Yields a shared_future with the current state and invalidates the state of f  Table18.1. OperationsofClassfuture   of background tasks can be shared in multiple objects by using a shared_future object, which share   yields.  If the destructor is called for a future that is the last owner of a shared state and the associated  task has started but not ﬁnished yet, the destructor blocks until the end of the task.  18.3.3 Shared Futures in Detail  Class shared_future   introduced in Section 18.1.3, page 960  provides the same semantics and interface as class future  see Section 18.3.2, page 975  with the following differences:   Multiple calls of get   are allowed. Thus, get   does not invalidate its state.   Copy semantics  copy constructor, copy assignment operator  are supported.   get   is a constant member function returning a const reference to the value stored in the shared state  which means that you have to ensure that the lifetime of the returned reference is shorter than the shared state . For class std::future, get   is a nonconstant member function returning a move-assigned copy  or a copy if that’s not supported , unless the class is specialized by a reference type.    Member share   is not provided.   18.3 Starting a Thread in Detail  977  The fact that the return value of get   is not copied creates some risks. Besides lifetime issues, data races are possible. Data races occur with unclear order of conﬂicting actions on the same data, such as nonsynchronized reads and writes from multiple threads, and result in undeﬁned behavior  see Section 18.4.1, page 982 .  The same problem applies to exceptions. One example discussed during the standardization was  when an exception was caught by reference and then modiﬁed:  shared_future  sp = async f ; sp.get  ;  try {  } catch  E& e  { e.modify  ;  }     risk of undeﬁned behavior due to a data race  This code introduces a data race if another thread processes the exception. To solve this issue, it was proposed to require that current_exception   and rethrow_exception  , which are used internally to pass exceptions between threads, create copies of the exceptions. However, the costs for this change were considered too high. As a result, programmers have to know what they’re doing when dealing with nonconstant references used in different threads.  18.3.4 Class std::promise in Detail  An object of class std::promise, introduced in Section 18.2.2, page 969, is provided to temporar- ily hold a  return  value or an exception. Or, in general, a promise can hold a shared state  see Section 18.3, page 973 . The shared state is said to be ready if it holds a value or an exception. Table 18.2 lists the operations available for class promise.  Note that you can call get_future   only once. A second call throws a std::future_error with the error code std::future_errc::future_already_retrieved. In general, if no shared state is associated, a std::future_error with the error code std::future_errc::no_state might be thrown.  All member functions that set the value or exception are thread safe. That is, they behave as if a  mutex ensures that only one of them can update the shared state at a time.  18.3.5 Class std::packaged_task in Detail  Class std::packaged_task  is provided to hold both some functionality to perform and its out- come  the so-called shared state of the functionality, see Section 18.3, page 973 , which might be a return value or an exception raised by the functionality. You can initialize the packaged task with the associated functionality. Then, you can call this functionality by calling operator    for the packaged task. Finally, you can process the outcome by getting a future for the packaged task. Table 18.3 lists the operations available for class packaged_task.  Any exception caused by the constructor taking the task, such as if no memory is available, is  also stored in its shared state.   promise p allocator_arg,alloc   978  Operation promise p  promise p rv   p.~promise    p = rv  swap p1,p2  p1.swap p2  p.get_future    p.set_value val   p.set_value_at_thread_exit val   p.set_exception e   p.set_exception_at_thread_exit e   Chapter 18: Concurrency  Effect Default constructor; creates a promise with shared state Creates a promise with shared state, which uses alloc as allocator Move constructor; creates a new promise object, which gets the state of rv and removes the shared state from rv Releases the shared state and if it is not ready  no value or exception , stores a std::future_error exception with condition broken_promise Move assignment; move assigns the state of rv to p and if p was not ready, stores a std::future_error exception with condition broken_promise there Swaps states of p1 and p2 Swaps states of p1 and p2 Yields a future object to retrieve the shared state  outcome of a thread  Sets val as  return  value and makes the state ready  or throws std::future_error  Sets val as  return  value and makes the state ready at the end of the current thread  or throws std::future_error  Sets e as exception and makes the state ready  or throws std::future_error  Sets e as exception and makes the state ready at the end of the current thread  or throws std::future_error   Table18.2.

OperationsofClasspackaged_task   18.3.6 Class std::thread in Detail  An object of class std::thread, introduced in Section 18.2.1, page 964, is provided to start and represent a thread. These objects are intended to map one-to-one with threads provided by the operating system. Table 18.4 lists the operations available for class thread.  The association between a thread object and a thread starts by initializing  or move copy assign  a callable object  see Section 4.4, page 54  to it with optional additional arguments. The association ends either with join    waiting for the outcome of the thread  or with detach    explicitly losing the association to the thread . One or the other must be called before the lifetime of a thread object ends or a new thread gets move assigned. Otherwise, the program aborts with std::terminate    see Section 5.8.2, page 162 .  If the thread object has an associated thread, it is said to be joinable. In that case, joinable    yields true, and get_id   yields a thread ID that differs from std::thread::id  .  Thread IDs have their own type std::thread::id. Its default constructor yields a unique ID representing “no thread.” thread::get_id   yields this value if no thread is associated or another unique ID if the thread object is associated with a thread  is joinable .

OperationsofObjectsofClassthread  for thread IDs are to compare them or to write them to an output stream. In addition, a hash function is provided to manage thread IDs in unordered containers  see Section 7.9, page 356 . A thread ID of a terminated thread might be reused again. Don’t make any other assumptions about thread IDs other than that, especially regarding their values. See Section 18.2.1, page 968, for details.  Note that detached threads should not access objects whose lifetimes have ended. This implies the problem that when ending the program, you have to ensure that detached threads don’t access global static objects  see Section 18.2.1, page 967 .  In addition, class std::thread provides a static member function to query a hint for the possible  number of parallel threads:  unsigned int std::thread::hardware_concurrency      Returns the number of possible threads.   This value is just a hint and does not guarantee to be exact.   Returns 0 if the number is not computable or well deﬁned.   18.3 Starting a Thread in Detail  981  18.3.7 Namespace this_thread  For any thread, including the main thread,   declares namespace std::this_thread, which provides the thread-speciﬁc global functions listed in Table 18.5.

Thread-SpeciﬁcOperationsofNamespace std::this_thread  Note that sleep_for   and sleep_until   usually will differ when dealing with system-time  adjustments  see Section 5.7.5, page 160, for details .  The operation this_thread::yield   is provided to give a hint to the system that it is useful to give up the remainder of the current thread’s time slice so that the runtime environment can reschedule to allow other threads to run. One typical example is to give up control when you wait or “poll” for another thread  see Section 18.1.1, page 955  or an atomic ﬂag to be set by another thread  see Section 18.4.3, page 986 :11  while  !readyFlag  {     loop until data is ready  std::this_thread::yield  ;  }  As another example, when you fail to get a lock or a mutex while locking multiple locks mutexes at a time, you can make the application faster by using yield   prior to trying the locks mutexes in a different order.12  11 Thanks to Bartosz Milewski for this example. 12 Thanks to Howard Hinnant for this example.   982  Chapter 18: Concurrency  18.4 Synchronizing Threads, or the Problem of  Concurrency  Using multiple threads is almost always combined with concurrent data access. Rarely are multiple threads run independently of one another. Threads might provide data processed by other threads or prepare preconditions necessary to start other processes.  This is where multithreading becomes tricky. Many things can go wrong. Or, put another way, many things can behave differently from what the naive  and even the experienced  programmer might expect.  So, before discussing different ways to synchronize threads and concurrent data access, we have to understand the problem. Then we can discuss the following techniques to synchronize threads:   Mutexes and locks  see Section 18.5, page 989 , including call_once    see Section 18.5.3,   Condition variables  see Section 18.6, page 1003    Atomics  see Section 18.7, page 1012   page 1000   18.4.1 Beware of Concurrency!  Before discussing the details of the problems of concurrency, let me formulate a ﬁrst rule just in case you want to start programming without going into the depth of this subsection. If you learn one rule about dealing with multiple threads, it should be the following:  The only safe way to concurrently access the same data by multiple threads without synchronization is when ALL threads only READ the data.  By “the same data” I mean data that uses the same memory location. If different threads concurrently access different variables or objects or different members of them, there is no problem because, since C++11, each variable except a bitﬁeld is guaranteed to have its own memory location.13 The only exceptions are bitﬁelds, because different bitﬁelds might share a memory location so that accessing different bitﬁelds means shared access of the same data.  However, when two or more threads concurrently access the same variable or object or member of it and at least one of the threads performs modiﬁcations, you can easily get into deep trouble if you don’t synchronize that access. This is what is called a data race in C++. In the C++11 standard, a data race is deﬁned as “two conﬂicting actions in different threads, at least one of which is not atomic, and neither happens before the other.” A data race always results in undeﬁned behavior.  As always with race conditions, the problem is that your code might often do what you intended, but it will not always work, which is one of the nastiest problems we can face in programming. Just by using other data, going into production mode, or switching a platform might suddenly break your code. So it’s probably a good idea to care about concurrent data access if you use multiple threads.  13 The guarantee of separate memory locations for different objects was not given before C++11. C++98 C++03 was a standard for single-threaded applications only. So, strictly speaking, before C++11 concurrent access to different objects resulted in undeﬁned behavior, although in practice it usually caused no problems.   18.4 Synchronizing Threads, or the Problem of Concurrency  983  18.4.2 The Reason for the Problem of Concurrent Data Access  To understand the problems of concurrent data access, we have to understand which guarantees C++ gives regarding the usage of concurrency. Note that a programming language such as C++ always is an abstraction to support different platforms and hardware, which provide different abilities and interfaces according to their architecture and purpose. Thus, a standard such as C++ speciﬁes the effect of statements and operations and not the corresponding generated assembler code. The standard describes the what, not the how.  In general, the behavior is not deﬁned so precisely that there is only one way to implement it. In fact, behavior might even explicitly be undeﬁned. For example, the order of argument evaluation of a function call is unspeciﬁed. A program expecting a speciﬁc evaluation order would result in undeﬁned behavior.  Thus, the important question is: Which guarantees does a language give? Programmers should not expect more, even though the additional guarantees might be “obvious.” In fact, according to the so-called as-if rule, each compiler can optimize code as long as the behavior of the program visible from the outside behaves the same. Thus, the generated code is a black box and can vary as long as the observable behavior remains stable. To quote the C++ standard:  An implementation is free to disregard any requirement of this International Standard as long as the result is as if the requirement had been obeyed, as far as can be determined from the observable behavior of the program. For instance, an actual implementation need not evaluate part of an expression if it can deduce that its value is not used and that no side effects affecting the observable behavior of the program are produced.  Any undeﬁned behavior is provided to give both compiler and hardware vendors the freedom and ability to generate the best code possible, whatever their criteria for “best” are. Yes, it applies to both: Compilers might unroll loops, reorder statements, eliminate dead code, prefetch data, and in modern architectures, for example, a hardware buffer might reorder loads or stores.  Reorderings can be useful to improve the speed of the program, but they might break the behavior. To be able to beneﬁt from fast speed where useful, safety is not the default. Thus, especially for concurrent data access, we have to understand which guarantees are given.  18.4.3 What Exactly Can Go Wrong  the Extent of the  Problem   To give compilers and hardware enough freedom to optimize code, C++ does not in general give a couple of guarantees you might expect. The reason is that applying these guarantees in all cases, not only where useful, would cost too much in performance. In fact, in C++, we might have the following problems:   Unsynchronized data access: When two threads running in parallel read and write the same  data, it is open which statement comes ﬁrst.   984  Chapter 18: Concurrency    Half-written data: When one thread reads data, which another thread modiﬁes, the reading thread might even read the data in the middle of the write of the other thread, thus reading neither the old nor the new value.   Reordered statements: Statements and operations might be reordered so that the behavior of  each single thread is correct, but in combination of all threads, expected behavior is broken.  Unsynchronized Data Access  The following code ensures that f   is called for the absolute value of val, negating the argument val if it is negative:  In a single-threaded environment, this code works ﬁne. However, in a multithreaded context, this code does not necessarily work. If multiple threads have access to val, the value of val might change between the if clause and the call of f   so that a negative value is passed to f  .  if  val >= 0  {  f val ;     pass positive val  } else {  f -val ;     pass negated negative val  For the same reason, simple code such as: std::vector  v; ... if  !v.empty    {  std::cout << v.front   << std::endl;  }  }  can be a problem if v is shared between multiple threads, because between the call of empty   and the call of front  , v might become empty resulting in undeﬁned behavior  see Section 7.3.2, page 275 .  Note that this problem also applies to code implementing a function provided by the C++ stan-  dard library. For example, the guarantee that  v.at 5      yield value of element with index 5  throws an exception if v does not have enough elements no longer applies if another thread might modify v while at   is called. Thus, keep in mind the following:  Unless otherwise stated, C++ standard library functions usually don’t support writes or reads concurrently performed with writes to the same data structure.14  14 As Hans Boehm points out, an approach to support concurrent access to library objects would not be useful in general because if I need synchronization around data structure accesses, it’s usually not just the individual accesses I need to protect but larger sections of code. This means that programmers need to do their own locking anyway, and the library-provided locking would be at best redundant.   18.4 Synchronizing Threads, or the Problem of Concurrency  985  That is, unless otherwise stated, multiple calls on the same object from multiple threads will result in undeﬁned behavior.  However, the C++ standard library provides some guarantees regarding thread safety  see Sec- tion 4.5, page 56 . For example:   Concurrent access to different elements of the same container is possible  except for class vector  . Thus, different threads might concurrently read and or write different elements of the same container. For example, each thread might process something and store the result in “its” element of a shared vector.   Concurrent access to a string stream, ﬁle stream, or stream buffer results in undeﬁned behavior. However, as we have seen in this chapter before, formatted input and output to a standard stream that is synchronized with C I O  see Section 15.14.1, page 845  is possible, although it might result in interleaved characters.  Half-Written Data  Consider that we have a variable15  long long x = 0;  and one thread writing the data:  x = -1;  and one thread reading the data:  std::cout << x;  What is the output of the program; that is, which value does the second thread read when it outputs x? Well, the following answers are possible:   0  the old value of x , if the ﬁrst thread has not assigned -1 yet   -1  the new value of x , if the ﬁrst thread assigned -1 already   Any other value, if the second thread reads x during the assignment of -1 by the ﬁrst thread The last option — any other value — can, for example, easily happen if, on a 32-bit machine, the assignment results in two stores and the read by the second thread happens when the ﬁrst store was done but the second store was not yet done.  And beware, this does not apply to long long only. Even for a fundamental data type, such as int or bool, the standard does not guarantee that a read or a write is atomic; that is, that a read or write is an exclusive noninterruptable data access. A data race might be less likely, but to eliminate the possibility, you have to take the steps.  The same applies to more complicated data structures, even if they are provided by the C++ stan- dard library. For example, for a std::list   see Section 7.5, page 290 , it’s up to the programmer to ensure that it doesn’t get modiﬁed by another thread while a thread inserts or deletes an element. Otherwise, the other thread might use an inconsistent state of the list, where, for example, the forward pointer is modiﬁed already but the backward pointer is not.  15 This example is taken with permission from [N2480:MemMod].   986  Reordered Statements  Chapter 18: Concurrency  Let’s discuss another simple example.16 Suppose we have two shared objects, an int to pass data from one thread to another and a Boolean readyFlag, which signals when the ﬁrst thread has provided the data: long data; bool readyFlag = false;  A naive approach is to synchronize the setting of the data in one thread with the consumption of the data in another thread. Thus, the providing thread calls:  data = 42; readyFlag = true;  and the consuming thread calls:  ;  } foo data ;  while  !readyFlag  {     loop until data is ready  Without knowing any details, almost every programmer at ﬁrst would suppose that the second thread calls foo   when data has the value 42, assuming that the call of foo   can be reached only if the readyFlag is true, which itself can be the case only after the ﬁrst thread assigned 42 to data, because this happens before the readyFlag becomes true.  But this is not necessarily the case. In fact, the output of the second thread might be the value data had before the ﬁrst thread assigned 42  or even any other value, because the assignment of 42 might be half-done .  That is, the compiler and or the hardware might reorder the statements so that effectively the  following gets called:  readyFlag = true; data = 42;  In general, such a reordering is allowed due to the rules of C++, which requires only that the observ- able behavior inside a thread of the generated code be correct. For the behavior of the ﬁrst thread, it doesn’t matter whether we ﬁrst modify readyFlag or data; from the viewpoint of this thread, they are independent of each other. Thus, reorderings of statements are allowed as long as the visible effect to the outside of a single thread is the same.  For the same reason, even the second thread might reorder the statements, provided that the  behavior of this thread is not affected:  foo data ; while  !readyFlag  {     loop until data is ready  ;  }  16 This example is [Milewski:Multicore] and [Milewski:Atomics] for details .  taken from multiple articles  in Bartosz Milewski’s Programming Cafe  see   18.4 Synchronizing Threads, or the Problem of Concurrency  987  Note that the observable behavior might be affected by such a reordering if foo   throws. Thus, it depends on details whether such reorderings are allowed, but in principle, the problem applies.  Again, the reason to allow such modiﬁcations is that by default, C++ compilers shall be able to generate code that is highly optimized, and some optimizations might be to reorder statements. By default, these optimizations are not required to care about possible other threads, which makes these optimizations easier because local analyses are enough.  18.4.4 The Features to Solve the Problems  To solve the three major problems of concurrent data access, we need the following concepts:   Atomicity: This means that read or write access to a variable or to a sequence of statements happens exclusively and without any interruption, so that one thread can’t read intermediate states caused by another thread.   Order: We need some ways to guarantee the order of speciﬁc statements or of a group of speciﬁc  statements.  The C++ standard library provides very different ways to deal with these concepts, so that programs beneﬁt from additional guarantees regarding concurrent access:   You can use futures  see Section 18.1, page 946  and promises  see Section 18.2.2, page 969 , which guarantee both atomicity and order: Setting the outcome  return value or exception  of a shared state is guaranteed to happen before the processing of this outcome, which implies that read and write access does not happen concurrently.   You can use mutexes and locks  see Section 18.5, page 989  to deal with critical sections, or protected zones, whereby you can grant exclusive access so that, for example, nothing can happen between a check and an operation based on that check. Locks provide atomicity by blocking all access using a second lock until a ﬁrst lock on the same resource gets released. More precisely: The release of a lock object acquired by one thread is guaranteed to happen before the acquisition of the same lock object by another thread is successful. However, if two threads use locked access to data, the order in which they access it may change from run to run.   You can use condition variables  see Section 18.6, page 1003  to efﬁciently allow one thread to wait for some predicate controlled by another thread to become true. This helps to deal with the order of multiple threads by allowing one or more threads to process data or a status provided by one or more other threads.17   You can use atomic data types  see Section 18.7, page 1012  to ensure that each access to a   You can use the low-level interface of atomic data types  see Section 18.7.4, page 1019 , which allow experts to relax the order of atomic statements or to use manual barriers for memory access  so-called fences .  variable or object is atomic while the order of operations on the atomic types remains stable.  In principle, this list is sorted from high-level to low-level features. High-level features, such as futures and promises or mutexes and locks, are easy to use and provide little risk. Low-level fea-  17 Concurrency experts won’t consider condition variables to be a tool to deal with the problem of concurrent data access, because they’re more a tool to improve performance than to provide correctness.   988  Chapter 18: Concurrency  tures, such as atomics and especially their low-level interface, might provide better performance because they have lower latency and therefore higher scalability, but the risk of misuse grows signif- icantly. Nevertheless, low-level features sometimes provide simple solutions for speciﬁc high-level problems.  With atomics, we go in the direction of lock-free programming, which even experts sometimes do wrong. To quote Herb Sutter from [Sutter:LockFree]: “[Lock-free code is] hard even for experts. It’s easy to write lock-free code that appears to work, but it’s very difﬁcult to write lock-free code that is correct and performs well. Even good magazines and refereed journals have published a substantial amount of lock-free code that was actually broken in subtle ways and needed correction.”  volatile and Concurrency  Note that I didn’t mention volatile here as a feature for concurrent data access, although you might have expected that for the following reasons:   volatile is known as a C++ keyword to prevent too much optimization.   In Java, volatile provides some guarantees about atomicity and order. In C++, volatile “only” speciﬁes that access to external resources, such as shared memory, should not be optimized away. For example, without volatile, a compiler might eliminate redundant loads of the same shared memory segment because it can’t see any modiﬁcation of the segment throughout the whole program. But in C++, volatile provides neither atomicity nor a speciﬁc order.18 Thus, the semantics of volatile between C++ and Java now differs.  See also Section 18.5.1, page 998, for a discussion, why volatile usually is not required when  mutexes are used to read data in a loop.  18 Thanks to Scott Meyers for pointing this out to me.   18.5 Mutexes and Locks  989  18.5 Mutexes and Locks  A mutex, or mutual exclusion, is an object that helps to control the concurrent access of a resource by providing exclusive access to it. The resource might be an object or a combination of multiple objects. To get exclusive access to the resource, the corresponding thread locks the mutex, which prevents other threads from locking that mutex until the ﬁrst thread unlocks the mutex.  18.5.1 Using Mutexes and Locks  Consider that we want to protect concurrent access to an object val that is used at various places:  int val;  A naive approach to synchronize this concurrent access is to introduce a mutex, which is used to enable and control exclusive access:  int val; std::mutex valMutex;     control exclusive access to val  Then, each access has to lock this mutex to get exclusive access. For example, one thread might program the following  note that this is a poor solution, which we will improve :  valMutex.lock  ; if  val >= 0  {  f val ;     val is positive     request exclusive access to val  } else {  f -val ;     pass negated negative val  } valMutex.unlock  ;     release exclusive access to val  Another thread might access the same resource as follows:  valMutex.lock  ; ++val; valMutex.unlock  ;     request exclusive access to val     release exclusive access to val  It’s important that all places where concurrent access is possible use the same mutex. This applies to both read and write accesses.  This simple approach can, however, become pretty complicated. For example, you should ensure that an exception, which ends an exclusive access, also unlocks the corresponding mutex. Otherwise, a resource might become locked forever. Also, deadlock scenarios are possible, with two threads waiting for a lock of the other thread before freeing their own lock.  The C++ standard library tries to deal with these problems but can’t conceptionally solve them all. For example, to deal with exceptions, you should not lock and unlock a mutex yourself. You should use the RAII principle  Resource Acquisition Is Initialization , whereby the constructor ac-   990  Chapter 18: Concurrency  quires a resource so that the destructor, which is always called even when an exception causes the end of the lifetime, releases the resource automatically. For this purpose, the C++ standard library provides class std::lock_guard:  int val; std::mutex valMutex; ... std::lock_guard  lg valMutex ; if  val >= 0  {     control exclusive access to val  f val ;     val is positive  } else {  }  f -val ;     pass negated negative val     lock and automatically unlock  Note, however, that locks should be limited to the shortest period possible because they block other code from running in parallel. Because the destructor releases the lock, you might want to insert explicit braces so that the lock gets released before further statements are processed:  int val; std::mutex valMutex; ... {     control exclusive access to val  std::lock_guard  lg valMutex ; if  val >= 0  {  f val ;     val is positive     lock and automatically unlock  } else {  }  f -val ;     pass negated negative val  }    ensure that lock gets released here ...  or just:  ... {  std::lock_guard  lg valMutex ; ++val;     lock and automatically unlock  }    ensure that lock gets released here ...  This is just a ﬁrst simple example, but you can see that the whole topic can easily become pretty com- plicated. As usual, programmers should know what they program in concurrent mode. In addition, different mutexes and locks are provided, which are discussed in the upcoming subsections.   18.5 Mutexes and Locks  991  A First Complete Example for Using a Mutex and a Lock  Let’s look at a ﬁrst complete example:     concurrency mutex1.cpp  include   include   include   include    std::mutex printMutex;     enable synchronized output with print    void print  const std::string& s  {  std::lock_guard  l printMutex ; for  char c : s  {  std::cout.put c ;  } std::cout << std::endl;  int main   {  }  }  auto f1 = std::async  std::launch::async,  auto f2 = std::async  std::launch::async,  print, "Hello from a first thread" ;  print, "Hello from a second thread" ;  print "Hello from the main thread" ;  Here, print   writes all characters of a passed string to the standard output. Thus, without a lock, the output might be:19  HHelHello from a second thread ello from a first thread lo from the main thread  or:  thr  ead  HelloHello fHello from a second ro from am th fthe main irrethreadstad  19 The fact that each character is written on its own with put   forces the behavior of getting interleaved characters when multiple parallel writes are performed. When writing each string as a whole, implementations often will not mix characters, but even this isn’t guaranteed.   992  Chapter 18: Concurrency  To synchronize the output in a way that each call of print   exclusively writes its characters, we introduce a mutex for the print operation and a lock guard, which locks the corresponding protected section:     enable synchronized output with print    std::mutex printMutex; ... void print  const std::string& s  {  std::lock_guard  l printMutex ; ...  }  Now the output is simply something like this:  Hello from a first thread Hello from the main thread Hello from a second thread  This output also is possible  but not guaranteed  when no lock is used.  Here, the lock   of the mutex, called by the constructor of the lock guard, blocks if the resource is acquired already. It blocks until access to the protected section is available again. However, the order of locks is still undeﬁned. Thus, the three outputs might still be written in arbitrary order.  Recursive Locks  Sometimes, the ability to lock recursively is required. Typical examples are active objects or moni- tors, which contain a mutex and take a lock inside every public method to protect data races corrupt- ing the internal state of the object. For example, a database interface might look as follows:  class DatabaseAccess {  private:  std::mutex dbMutex; ...     state of database access  public:  void createTable  ...  {  } void insertData  ...  {  } ...  };  std::lock_guard  lg dbMutex ; ...  std::lock_guard  lg dbMutex ; ...   18.5 Mutexes and Locks  993  When we introduce a public member function that might call other public member functions, this can become complicated:  void createTableAndInsertData  ...  {  std::lock_guard  lg dbMutex ; ... createTable ... ;     ERROR: deadlock because dbMutex is locked again  }  Calling createTableAndInsertData   will result in a deadlock because after locking dbMutex, the call of createTable   will try to lock dbMutex again, which will block until the lock of dbMutex is available, which will never happen because createTableAndInsertData   will block until createTable   is done.  The C++ standard library permits the second attempt to throw a std::system_error  see Sec- tion 4.3.1, page 43  with the error code resource_deadlock_would_occur  see Section 4.3.2, page 45  if the platform detects such a deadlock. But this is not required and is often not the case.  By using a recursive_mutex, this behavior is no problem. This mutex allows multiple locks  by the same thread and releases the lock when the last corresponding unlock   call is called:  class DatabaseAccess {  private:  std::recursive_mutex dbMutex; ...     state of database access  public:  void insertData  ...  {  std::lock_guard  lg dbMutex ; ...  } void insertData  ...  {  std::lock_guard  lg dbMutex ; ...  } void createTableAndinsertData  ...  {  std::lock_guard  lg dbMutex ; ... createTable ... ;     OK: no deadlock  } ...  };   994  Tried and Timed Locks  Chapter 18: Concurrency  Sometimes a program wants to acquire a lock but doesn’t want to block  forever  if this is not possible. For this situation, mutexes provide a try_lock   member function that tries to acquire a lock. If it succeeds, it returns true; if not, false.  To still be able to use a lock_guard so that any exit from the current scope unlocks the mutex,  you can pass an additional argument adopt_lock to its constructor:  std::mutex m;     try to acquire a lock and do other stuff while this isn’t possible while  m.try_lock   == false  {  doSomeOtherStuff  ;  } std::lock_guard  lg m,std::adopt_lock ; ...  Note that try_lock   might fail spuriously. That is, it might fail  return false  even if the lock is not taken.20  To wait only for a particular amount of time, you can use a timed mutex. The special mu- tex classes std::timed_mutex and std::recursive_timed_mutex additionally allow calling try_lock_for   or try_lock_until   to wait for at most a speciﬁed duration of time or until a speciﬁed point in time has arrived. This, for example, might help if you have real-time requirements or want to avoid possible deadlock situations. For example:  std::timed_mutex m;     try for one second to acquire a lock if  m.try_lock_for std::chrono::seconds 1    {  std::lock_guard  lg m,std::adopt_lock ; ...  } else {  }  couldNotGetTheLock  ;  Note that try_lock_for   and try_lock_until   usually will differ when dealing with system- time adjustments  see Section 5.7.5, page 160, for details .  Dealing with Multiple Locks  Usually a thread should lock only one mutex at a time. However, it is sometimes necessary to lock more than one mutex  for example, to transfer data from one protected resource to another . In that  20 This behavior is provided for memory-ordering reasons but is not widely known. Thanks to Hans Boehm and Bartosz Milewski for pointing it out.   18.5 Mutexes and Locks  995  case, dealing with the lock mechanisms introduced so far can become complicated and risky: You might get the ﬁrst but not the second lock, or deadlock situations may occur if you lock the same locks in a different order.  The C++ standard library, therefore, provides convenience functions to try to lock multiple mu-  texes. For example:  std::mutex m1; std::mutex m2; ... {     lock both mutexes  or none if not possible  std::lock  m1, m2 ; std::lock_guard  lockM1 m1,std::adopt_lock ; std::lock_guard  lockM2 m2,std::adopt_lock ; ...    automatically unlock all mutexes  }  The global std::lock   locks all mutexes passed as arguments, blocking until all mutexes are locked or until an exception is thrown. In the latter case, it unlocks mutexes already successfully locked. As usual, after successful locking, you can and should use a lock guard initialized with adopt_lock as second argument to ensure that, in any case, the mutexes are unlocked when leaving the scope. Note that this lock   provides a deadlock-avoidance mechanism, which, however, means that the order of locking inside a multiple lock is undeﬁned.  In the same way, you can try to acquire multiple locks without blocking if not all locks are available. The global std::try_lock   returns -1 if all locks were possible. If not, the return value is the zero-based index of the ﬁrst failed lock. In that case, all succeeded locks are unlocked again. For example:  std::mutex m1; std::mutex m2;  int idx = std::try_lock  m1, m2 ;    both locks succeeded if  idx < 0  {     try to lock both mutexes  std::lock_guard  lockM1 m1,std::adopt_lock ; std::lock_guard  lockM2 m2,std::adopt_lock ; ...     automatically unlock all mutexes     idx has zero-based index of ﬁrst failed lock std::cerr << "could not lock mutex m" << idx+1 << std::endl;  } else {  }  Note that this try_lock   does not provide a deadlock-avoidance mechanism. Instead, it guaran- tees that the locks are tried in the order of the passed arguments.  Note also that calling lock   or try_lock   without adopting the locks by a guard is usually not what was intended. Although the code looks like it creates locks that are released automatically when leaving the scope, this is not the case. The mutexes will remain locked:   996  Chapter 18: Concurrency  std::mutex m1; std::mutex m2; ... {  std::lock  m1, m2 ;    no lock adopted ...  } ...     OOPS: mutexes are still locked !!!  Class unique_lock     lock both mutexes  or none if not possible   Besides class lock_guard , the C++ standard library provides class unique_lock , which is a lot more ﬂexible when dealing with locks for mutexes. Class unique_lock  provides the same interface as class lock_guard , plus the ability to program explicitly when and how to lock or unlock its mutex. Thus, this lock object may or may not have a mutex locked  also known as owning a mutex . This differs from a lock_guard , which always has an object locked throughout its lifetime.21 In addition, for unique locks you can query whether the mutex is currently locked by calling owns_lock   or operator bool  .  The major advantage of this class still is that when the mutex is locked at destruction time, the  destructor automatically calls unlock   for it. If no mutex is locked, the destructor does nothing.  Compared to class lock_guard, class unique_lock provides the following supplementary  constructors:   You can pass try_to_lock for a nonblocking attempt to lock a mutex:  std::unique_lock  lock mutex,std::try_to_lock ; ... if  lock  {    if lock was successful    You can pass a duration or timepoint to the constructor to try to lock for a speciﬁc period of time:  std::unique_lock  lock mutex,  std::chrono::seconds 1  ;    You can pass defer_lock to initialize the lock without locking the mutex  yet : std::unique_lock  lock mutex,std::defer_lock ; ... lock.lock  ; ...     or  timed  try_lock    ...  }  ...  21 The name unique lock explains where this behavior comes from. As with unique pointers  see Section 5.2.5, page 98 , you can move locks between scopes, but it is guaranteed that only one lock at a time owns a mutex.   18.5 Mutexes and Locks  997  The defer_lock ﬂag can, for example, be used to create one or multiple locks and lock them later:  std::mutex m1; std::mutex m2;  std::unique_lock  lockM1 m1,std::defer_lock ; std::unique_lock  lockM2 m2,std::defer_lock ; ... std::lock  m1, m2 ;     lock both mutexes  or none if not possible   In addition, class unique_lock provides the ability to release   its mutex or to transfer the own- ership of a mutex to another lock. See Section 18.5.2, page 1000, for details.  With both a lock_guard and a unique_lock, we can now implement a naive example, where  one thread waits for another by polling a ready ﬂag:  include   ... bool readyFlag; std::mutex readyFlagMutex;  void thread1   {     do something thread2 needs as preparation ... std::lock_guard  lg readyFlagMutex ; readyFlag = true;  }  }  void thread2   {     wait until readyFlag is true  thread1 is done  {  std::unique_lock  ul readyFlagMutex ; while  !readyFlag  {  ul.unlock  ; std::this_thread::yield  ; std::this_thread::sleep_for std::chrono::milliseconds 100  ; ul.lock  ;     hint to reschedule to the next thread  }  }    release lock     do whatever shall happen after thread1 has prepared things ...   998  Chapter 18: Concurrency  Two comments on typical questions this code might raise:   If you wonder why we use a mutex to control the access to read and write the readyFlag, remember the rule introduced at the beginning of this chapter: Any concurrent access with at least one write should be synchronized. See Section 18.4, page 982, and Section 18.7, page 1012, for a detailed discussion about this.   If you wonder that no volatile is necessary here to declare readyFlag to avoid that multiple attempts in thread2   to read it are not optimized away note the following: These attempts to read readyFlag happen inside a critical section, deﬁned between the setting and releasing of a lock. Such code is not allowed to get optimized in a way that the read  or a write  is moved outside the critical section. So the reads of readyFlag must effectively happen here: – At the beginning of the loop, between the declaration of ul and the ﬁrst call of unlock   – Inside the loop, between any call of lock   and unlock   – At the end of the loop, between the last call of lock   and the destruction of ul, which  unlocks the mutex if locked  Nevertheless, such a polling for a fulﬁlled condition is usually not a good solution. A better approach is to use condition variables. See Section 18.6.1, page 1003, for details.  18.5.2 Mutexes and Locks in Detail  Mutexes in Detail  The C++ standard library provides the following mutex classes  see Table 18.6 :   Class std::mutex is a simple mutex that can be locked only once by one thread at a time. If it is locked, any other lock   will block until the mutex is available again and try_lock   will fail.   Class std::recursive_mutex is a mutex that allows multiple locks at the same time by the same thread. The typical application of such a lock is where functions acquire a lock and internally call another function, which also acquires the same lock again.  Operation  mutex  lock   try_lock   unlock   try_lock_for   try_lock_until   multiple locks  – – No  recursive_ mutex  timed_mutex  recursive_ timed_mutex  Acquires mutex  blocks if not available   Acquires mutex  returns false if not available   Unlocks locked mutex  – – Yes  same thread   Tries to acquire a lock for a duration of time Tries to acquire a lock until a timepoint No  Yes  same thread   Table18.6. OverviewofMutexesandTheirAbilities   18.5 Mutexes and Locks  999    Class std::timed_mutex is a simple mutex that additionally allows you to pass a duration or a timepoint that deﬁnes how long it tries to acquire a lock. For this, try_lock_for   and try_lock_until   are provided.   Class std::recursive_timed_mutex is a mutex that allows multiple locks by the same  thread with optional timeouts.  Table 18.7 lists the mutex operations, if available.  Operation mutex m m.~mutex   m.lock    m.try_lock   m.try_lock_for dur   m.try_lock_until tp   m.unlock   m.native_handle    Effect Default constructor; creates an unlocked mutex Destroys the mutex  must not be locked  Locks the mutex  blocks for lock; error if locked and not recursive  Tries to lock the mutex  returns true if lock successful  Tries to lock for duration dur  returns true if lock successful  Tries to lock until timepoint tp  returns true if lock successful  Unlocks the mutex  undeﬁned behavior if not locked  Returns a platform-speciﬁc type native_handle_type for nonportable extensions  Table18.7. OperationsofMutexClasses,IfAvailable  lock   might throw a std::system_error  see Section 4.3.1, page 43  with the following error codes  see Section 4.3.2, page 45 :   operation_not_permitted, if the thread does not have the privilege to perform the operation   resource_deadlock_would_occur, if the platform detects that a deadlock would occur   device_or_resource_busy, if the mutex is already locked and blocking is not possible The behavior of a program is undeﬁned if it unlocks a mutex object it doesn’t own, destroys a mutex object owned by any thread, or if a thread terminates while owning a mutex object.  Note that try_lock_for   and try_lock_until   usually will differ when dealing with  system-time adjustments  see Section 5.7.5, page 160, for details .  Class lock_guard in Detail  Class std::lock_guard, introduced in Section 18.5.1, page 989, provides a very small interface to ensure that a locked mutex gets always freed when leaving the scope  see Table 18.8 . Throughout its lifetime, it is always associated with a lock either explicitly requested or adopted at construction time.   1000  Chapter 18: Concurrency  Operation lock_guard lg m  lock_guard lg m,adopt_lock  Creates a lock guard for the already locked mutex m lg.~lock_guard    Effect Creates a lock guard for the mutex m and locks it  Unlocks the mutex and destroys the lock guard  Table18.8. OperationsofClasslock_guard  Class unique_lock in Detail  Class std::unique_lock, introduced in Section 18.5.1, page 996, provides a lock guard for a mu- tex that does not necessarily have to be locked  owned . It provides the interface listed in Table 18.9. If it locks owns a mutex at destruction time, it will unlock   it. But you can control explicitly whether it has an associated mutex and whether this mutex is locked. You can also try to lock the mutex with or without timeouts.  lock   might throw a std::system_error  see Section 4.3.1, page 43  with the error codes listed for lock   for mutexes  see page 999 . unlock   might throw a std::system_error with the error code operation_not_permitted if the unique lock isn’t locked.  18.5.3 Calling Once for Multiple Threads  Sometimes multiple threads might not need some functionality that should get processed whenever the ﬁrst thread needs it. A typical example is lazy initialization: The ﬁrst time one of the threads needs something that has to get processed, you process it  but not before, because you want to save the time to process it if it is not needed .  The usual approach with single-threaded environments is simple: A Boolean ﬂag signals whether  the functionality was called already: bool initialized = false; ... if  !initialized  {  initialize  ; initialized = true;  }  or     global ﬂag     initialize if not initialized yet  static std::vector  staticData;  if  staticData.empty    {  staticData = initializeStaticData  ;  void foo   {  } ...  }   18.5 Mutexes and Locks  1001  Operation unique_lock l  Effect Default constructor; creates a lock not associated with a mutex Creates a lock guard for the mutex m and locks it  l.~unique_lock    unique_lock l rv   unique_lock l = rv  unique_lock l m,tp   unique_lock l m  unique_lock l m,adopt_lock  Creates a lock guard for the already locked mutex m unique_lock l m,defer_lock  Creates a lock guard for the mutex m without locking it unique_lock l m,try_lock  Creates a lock guard for the mutex m and tries to lock it unique_lock l m,dur  Creates a lock guard for the mutex m and tries to lock it for duration dur Creates a lock guard for the mutex m and tries to lock it until timepoint tp Move constructor; moves lock state from rv to l  rv has no associated mutex anymore  Unlocks the mutex, if any locked, and destroys the lock guard Move assignment; moves the lock state from rv to l  rv has no associated mutex anymore  Swaps locks Swaps locks Returns a pointer to the associated mutex and releases it Returns true if an associated mutex is locked Checks whether an associated mutex is locked Returns a pointer to the associated mutex Locks the associated mutex Tries to lock the associated mutex  returns true if lock successful  Tries to lock the associated mutex for duration dur  returns true if lock successful  Tries to lock the associated mutex until timepoint tp  returns true if lock successful  Unlocks the associated mutex  swap l1,l2  l1.swap l2  l.release   l.owns_lock   if  l  l.mutex   l.lock   l.try_lock    l.try_lock_until tp   l.try_lock_for dur   l.unlock    Table18.9. OperationsofClassunique_lock  Such code doesn’t work in a multithreaded context, because data races might occur if two or more threads check whether the initialization didn’t happen yet and start the initialization then. Thus, you have to protect the area for the check and the initialization against concurrent access.  As usual, you can use mutexes for it, but the C++ standard library provides a special solution for this case. You simply use a std::once_flag and call std::call_once  also provided by   :  std::once_flag oc; ... std::call_once oc,initialize ;     global ﬂag     initialize if not initialized yet   Chapter 18: Concurrency  static std::vector  staticData;  void foo   {  static std::once_flag oc; std::call_once oc,[]{  staticData = initializeStaticData  ;  } ;  As you can see, the ﬁrst argument passed to call_once   must be the corresponding once_flag. The further arguments are the usual arguments for callable objects: function, member function, function object, or lambda, plus optional arguments for the function called  see Section 4.4, page 54 . Thus, lazy initialization of an object used in multiple threads might look as follows:  mutable std::once_flag initDataFlag; void initData   const;  public:  data getData    const {  std::call_once initDataFlag,&X::initData,this ; ...  1002  or:  ...  }  class X { private:  }  };  In principle, you can call different functions for the same once ﬂag. The once ﬂag that is passed to call_once   as ﬁrst argument is what ensures that the passed functionality is performed only once. So, if the ﬁrst call was successful, further calls with the same once ﬂag won’t call the passed functionality even if that functionality is different.  Any exception caused by the called functionality is also thrown by call_once  . In that case, the “ﬁrst” call is considered not to be successful, so the next call_once   might still execute the passed functionality.22  22 The standard also speciﬁes that call_once   might throw a std::system_error if the once_flag ar- gument is no longer “valid”  i.e., destructed . However, this statement is considered to be a mistake because passing a destructed once ﬂag anyway is either not possible or results in undeﬁned behavior.   18.6 Condition Variables  1003  18.6 Condition Variables  Sometimes, tasks performed by different threads have to wait for each other. Thus, you sometimes have to synchronize concurrent operations for other reasons than to access the same data.  Now, you can argue that we have introduced such a mechanism already: Futures  see Sec- tion 18.1, page 946  allow you to block until data by another thread is provided or another thread is done. However, a future can pass data from one thread to another only once. In fact, a future’s major purpose is to deal with return values or exceptions of threads.  Here we introduce and discuss condition variables, which can be used to synchronize logical  dependencies in data ﬂow between threads multiple times.  18.6.1 Purpose of Condition Variables  Section 18.5.1, page 997, introduced a naive approach to let one thread wait for another by using something like a ready ﬂag, signaling when one thread has prepared or provided something for another thread. This usually means that the waiting thread polls to notice that its required data or precondition has arrived:  bool readyFlag; std::mutex readyFlagMutex;     wait until readyFlag is true: {  std::unique_lock  ul readyFlagMutex ; while  !readyFlag  {  ul.unlock  ; std::this_thread::yield  ; std::this_thread::sleep_for std::chrono::milliseconds 100  ; ul.lock  ;     hint to reschedule to the next thread  }  }    release lock  However, such a polling for a fulﬁlled condition is usually not a good solution. Or as [Williams:C++Conc] points out:  The waiting thread consumes valuable processing time repeatedly checking the ﬂag and when it locks the mutex the thread setting the ready ﬂag is blocked. ... In addition, it’s hard to get the sleep period right: too short a sleep in between checks and the thread still wastes processing time checking, too long a sleep and the thread will carry on sleeping even when the task it is waiting for is complete, introducing a delay.  A better approach is to use condition variables, which the C++ standard library provides in  . A condition variable is a variable by which a thread can wake up one or multiple other waiting threads.   1004  Chapter 18: Concurrency  In principle, a condition variable works as follows:   You have to include both   and   to declare a mutex and a con-  dition variable:  include   include    std::mutex readyMutex; std::condition_variable readyCondVar;    The thread  or one of multiple threads  that signals the fulﬁllment of a condition has to call  readyCondVar.notify_one  ;     notify one of the waiting threads  or  readyCondVar.notify_all  ;    Any thread that waits for the condition has to call     notify all the waiting threads  std::unique_lock  l readyMutex ; readyCondVar.wait l ;  Thus, the thread providing or preparing something simply calls notify_one   or notify_all   for the condition variable, which for one or all the waiting threads is the moment to wake up.  So far, so good. Sounds simple. But there’s more. First, note that to wait for the condition vari- able, you need a mutex and a unique_lock, introduced in Section 18.5.1, page 996. A lock_guard is not enough, because the waiting function might lock and unlock the mutex.  In addition, condition variables in general might have so-called spurious wakeups. That is, a wait on a condition variable may return even if the condition variable has not been notiﬁed. To quote Anthony Williams from [Williams:CondVar]: “Spurious wakes cannot be predicted: they are essentially random from the user’s point of view. However, they commonly occur when the thread library cannot reliably ensure that a waiting thread will not miss a notiﬁcation. Since a missed notiﬁcation would render the condition variable useless, the thread library wakes the thread from its wait rather than take the risk.”  Thus, a wakeup does not necessarily mean that the required condition now holds. Rather, after a wakeup you still need some code to verify that the condition in fact has arrived. Therefore, for example, we have to check whether provided data is really available, or we still need something like a ready ﬂag. To set and query this provided data or this ready ﬂag, we can use the same mutex.  18.6.2 A First Complete Example for Condition Variables  The following code is a complete example that demonstrates how to use condition variables:     concurrency condvar1.cpp  include   include   include   include     18.6 Condition Variables  1005  bool readyFlag; std::mutex readyMutex; std::condition_variable readyCondVar;  void thread1   {     do something thread2 needs as preparation std::cout  " << std::endl; std::cin.get  ;     signal that thread1 has prepared a condition {  std::lock_guard  lg readyMutex ; readyFlag = true;  }    release lock readyCondVar.notify_one  ;  }  }  }  void thread2   {     wait until thread1 is ready  readyFlag is true  {  std::unique_lock  ul readyMutex ; readyCondVar.wait ul, []{ return readyFlag; } ;  }    release lock     do whatever shall happen after thread1 has prepared things std::cout << "done" << std::endl;  int main   {  auto f1 = std::async std::launch::async,thread1 ; auto f2 = std::async std::launch::async,thread2 ;  After including the necessary header ﬁles, we need three things to communicate between threads: 1. An object for the data provided to process or a ﬂag signaling that the condition is indeed satisﬁed   here: readyFlag    2. A mutex  here: readyMutex  3. A condition variable  here readyCondVar    1006  Chapter 18: Concurrency  The providing thread thread1   locks the mutex readyMutex, updates the condition  the object for the data or for the ready ﬂag , unlocks the mutex, and notiﬁes the condition variable:  std::lock_guard  lg readyMutex ; readyFlag = true;  }    release lock readyCondVar.notify_one  ;  Note that the notiﬁcation itself does not have to be inside the protected area of the lock.  A waiting  consuming processing  thread locks the mutex with a unique_lock  Section 18.5.1,  page 996 , waits for the notiﬁcation while checking the condition, and releases the lock:  std::unique_lock  ul readyMutex ; readyCondVar.wait ul, []{ return readyFlag; } ;  }    release lock  Here, a wait   member for condition variables is used as follows: You pass the lock ul for the mutex readyMutex as ﬁrst argument and a lambda as callable object  see Section 4.4, page 54  double checking the condition as second argument. The effect is that wait   internally calls a loop until the passed callable returns true. Thus, the code has the same effect as the following code, where the loop necessary for dealing with spurious wakeups is explicitly visible:  {  {  {  std::unique_lock  ul readyMutex ; while  !readyFlag  {  readyCondVar.wait ul ;  }  }    release lock  Again note that you have to use a unique_lock and can’t use a lock_guard here, because inter- nally, wait   explicitly unlocks and locks the mutex.  You can argue that this is a bad example for using condition variables, because futures can be  used for blocking until some data arrives. So let’s present a second example.  18.6.3 Using Condition Variables to Implement a Queue  for Multiple Threads  In this example, three threads push values into a queue that two other threads read and process:     concurrency condvar2.cpp  include   include   include   include   include   include     18.6 Condition Variables  1007  std::queue  queue; std::mutex queueMutex; std::condition_variable queueCondVar;  void provider  int val  {     push different values  val til val+5 with timeouts of val milliseconds into the queue for  int i=0; i<6; ++i  {  {  std::lock_guard  lg queueMutex ; queue.push val+i ;  }    release lock queueCondVar.notify_one  ;  std::this_thread::sleep_for std::chrono::milliseconds val  ;  }  }  void consumer  int num  {     pop values if available  num identiﬁes the consumer  while  true  {  int val; {  std::unique_lock  ul queueMutex ; queueCondVar.wait ul,[]{ return !queue.empty  ; } ; val = queue.front  ; queue.pop  ;  }    release lock std::cout << "consumer " << num << ": " << val << std::endl;  }  }  int main   {     start three providers for values 100+, 300+, and 500+ auto p1 = std::async std::launch::async,provider,100 ; auto p2 = std::async std::launch::async,provider,300 ; auto p3 = std::async std::launch::async,provider,500 ;     start two consumers printing the values auto c1 = std::async std::launch::async,consumer,1 ; auto c2 = std::async std::launch::async,consumer,2 ;  }   1008  Chapter 18: Concurrency  Here, we have a global queue  see Section 12.2, page 638  concurrently used and protected by a mutex and a condition variable: std::queue  queue; std::mutex queueMutex; std::condition_variable queueCondVar;  The mutex ensures that reads and writes are atomic, and the condition variable is to signal and wake up processing threads when new values are available.  Now, three threads provide data by pushing it into the queue: {  std::lock_guard  lg queueMutex ; queue.push val+i ;  }    release lock queueCondVar.notify_one  ;  With notify_one  , they wake up one of the waiting threads to process the next value. Note again that this call does not have to be part of the protected section, so we close the block where the lock guard is declared before.  The threads waiting for new values to process operate as follows: int val; {  std::unique_lock  ul queueMutex ; queueCondVar.wait ul,[]{ return !queue.empty  ; } ; val = queue.front  ; queue.pop  ;  }    release lock ...  Here, according to the interface of a queue  see Section 12.2, page 638 , we need three calls to get the next value out of the queue: empty   checks whether a value is available. Calling empty   is the double-check to deal with spurious wakeups in wait  . front   queries the next value, and pop   removes it. All three are inside the protected region of the unique lock ul. However, the processing of the value returned by front   happens afterward to minimize the lock duration.  A possible output of this program is: consumer 1: 300 consumer 1: 100 consumer 2: 500 consumer 1: 101 consumer 2: 102 consumer 1: 301 consumer 2: 103 consumer 1: 104 consumer consumer 1: 105 2: 501   18.6 Condition Variables  1009  consumer 1: 302 consumer 2: 303 consumer 1: 502 consumer 2: 304 consumer 1: 503 consumer 2: 305 consumer 1: 504 consumer 2: 505  Note that the output of the two consumers is not synchronized, so characters might interleave. Note also that the order in which concurrent waiting threads are notiﬁed is not deﬁned.  In the same way, you can call notify_all   if multiple consumers will have to process the same data. A typical example would be an event-driven system, where an event has to get published to all registered consumers.  Also note that for condition variables, you have the interface of waiting for a maximum amount of time: wait_for   waits for a duration of time, whereas wait_until   waits until a timepoint has arrived.  18.6.4 Condition Variables in Detail  The header ﬁle   provides two classes for condition variables, class condition_variable and class condition_variable_any.  Class condition_variable  As introduced in Section 18.6, page 1003, class std::condition_variable is provided by the C++ standard library to be able to wake up one or multiple threads waiting for a speciﬁc condition  something necessary prepared or performed or some necessary data provided . Multiple threads can wait for the same condition variable. When a condition is fulﬁlled, a thread can notify one or all of the waiting threads.  Due to spurious wakeups, notifying a thread is not enough when a condition is fulﬁlled. Waiting  threads have and need to use the ability to double-check that the condition holds after a wakeup.  Table 18.10 lists the interface the C++ standard library provides for class condition_variable in detail. Class condition_variable_any provides the same interface except native_handle   and notify_all_at_thread_exit  .  If it can’t create a condition variable, the constructor might throw a std::system_error excep- tion  see Section 4.3.1, page 43  with the error code resource_unavailable_try_again, which is equivalent to the POSIX errno EAGAIN  see Section 4.3.2, page 45 . Copies and assignments are not allowed.   1010  Chapter 18: Concurrency  Operation condvar cv cv.~condvar   cv.notify_one   cv.notify_all   cv.wait ul  cv.wait ul,pred   cv.wait_for ul,duration   cv.wait_for ul,duration,pred   cv.wait_until ul,timepoint   cv.wait_until ul,timepoint,pred   cv.native_handle    Effect Default constructor; creates a condition variable Destroys the condition variable Wakes up one of the waiting threads, if any Wakes up all waiting threads Waits for notiﬁcation, using the unique lock ul Waits for notiﬁcation, using the unique lock ul, until pred yields true after a wakeup Waits for a notiﬁcation, using the unique lock ul, for duration Waits for a notiﬁcation, using the unique lock ul, for duration or until pred yields true after a wakeup Waits for a notiﬁcation, using the unique lock ul, until timepoint Waits for a notiﬁcation, using the unique lock ul, until timepoint or until pred yields true after a wakeup Returns a platform-speciﬁc type native_handle_type for nonportable extensions  notify_all_at_thread_exit cv,ul  Wakes up all waiting threads of cv, using the unique  lock ul, at the end of the calling thread  Table18.10. OperationsofClasscondition_variable  Notiﬁcations are automatically synchronized so that concurrent calls of notify_one   and  notify_all   cause no trouble.  All threads waiting for a condition variable have to use the same mutex, which has to be locked by a unique_lock when one of the wait   members is called. Otherwise, undeﬁned behavior occurs.  Note that consumers of a condition variable always operate on mutexes that are usually locked. Only the waiting functions temporarily unlock the mutex performing the following three atomic steps:23 1. Unlocking the mutex and entering the waiting state 2. Unblocking the wait 3. Locking the mutex again This implies that predicates passed to waiting functions are always called under the lock, so they may safely access the object s  protected by the mutex.24 The calls to lock and unlock the mutex might throw the corresponding exceptions  see Section 18.5.2, page 1000 .  23 The problem with a naive approach like “lock, check state, unlock, wait” is that notiﬁcations arising between unlock and wait would get lost. 24 Thanks to Bartosz Milewski for pointing this out.   18.6 Condition Variables  1011  Called without the predicate, both wait_for   and wait_until   return the following enu-  meration class  see Section 3.1.13, page 32  values:   std::cv_status::timeout if the absolute timeout happened   std::cv_status::no_timeout if a notiﬁcation happened Called with a predicate as third argument, wait_for   and wait_until   return the result of the predicate  whether the condition holds .  The global function notify_all_at_thread_exit cv,l  is provided to call notify_all   when the calling thread exits. For this, it temporarily locks the corresponding lock l, which must use the same mutex all waiting threads use. To avoid deadlocks, the thread should be exited directly after calling notify_all_at_thread_exit  . Thus, this call is only to cleanup before notifying waiting threads, and this cleanup should never block.25  Class condition_variable_any  the C++ standard library also provides a class Besides class std::condition_variable, class std::condition_variable_any, which does not std::unique_lock as lock. As the C++ standard library notes: “If a lock type other than one of the standard mutex types or a unique_lock wrapper for a standard mutex type is used with condition_variable_any, the user must ensure that any necessary synchronization is in place with respect to the predicate associated with the condition_variable_any instance.” In fact, the object has to fulﬁll the so-called BasicLockable requirements, which require providing synchronized lock   and unlock   member functions.  require using an object of  25 A typical example would be to signal the end of a detached thread  see Section 18.2.1, page 967 . By using notify_all_at_thread_exit  , you can ensure that thread local objects are destroyed before the main program  or master thread  processes the fact that the detached thread terminated.   1012  18.7 Atomics  Chapter 18: Concurrency  In the ﬁrst example for condition variables  see Section 18.6.1, page 1003 , we used a Boolean value readyFlag to let one thread signal that something is prepared or provided for another thread. Now, you might wonder why we still need a mutex here. If we have a Boolean value, why can’t we concurrently let one thread change the value while another thread checks it? The moment the providing thread sets the Boolean to true, the observing thread should be able to see that and perform the consequential processing.  1.  As introduced in Section 18.4, page 982, we have two problems here: In general, reading and writing even for fundamental data types is not atomic. Thus, you might read a half-written Boolean, which according to the standard results in undeﬁned behavior.  2. The generated code might change the order of operations, so the providing thread might set the ready ﬂag before the data is provided, and the consuming thread might process the data before evaluating the ready ﬂag.  With a mutex, both problems are solved, but a mutex might be a relatively expensive operation in both necessary resources and latency of the exclusive access. So, instead of using mutexes and lock, it might be worth using atomics instead.  In this section, I ﬁrst introduce the high-level interface of atomics, which provides atomic op- erations using the default guarantee regarding the order of memory access. This default guarantee provides sequential consistency, which means that in a thread, atomic operations are guaranteed to happen in the order as programmed. Thus, problems of reordered statements as introduced in Sec- tion 18.4.3, page 986, do not apply. At the end of this section, I present the low-level interface of atomics: operations with relaxed order guarantees.  Note that the C++ standard library does not distinguish between a high-level and a low-level atomics interface. The term low-level was introduced by Hans Boehm, one of the authors of the li- brary. Sometimes, it is also called the weak, or relaxed, atomic interface, and the high-level interface is sometimes also known as the normal, or strong, atomic interface.  18.7.1 Example of Using Atomics  Let’s transfer the example from Section 18.6.1, page 1003, into a program using atomics:  include   ... std::atomic  readyFlag false ;     for atomic types  void thread1   {     do something thread2 needs as preparation ... readyFlag.store true ;  }   18.7 Atomics  void thread2   {  1013     wait until readyFlag is true  thread1 is done  while  !readyFlag.load    {  std::this_thread::sleep_for std::chrono::milliseconds 100  ;  }     do whatever shall happen after thread1 has prepared things ...  First, we include the header ﬁle  , where atomics are declared:  include    Then, we declare an atomic object, using the std::atomic  class template:  std::atomic  readyFlag false ;  In principle, you can use any trivial, integral, or pointer type as template parameter.  Note that you always should initialize atomic objects because the default constructor does not fully initialize it  it’s not that the initial value is undeﬁned, it is that the lock is uninitialized .26 For static-duration atomic objects, you should use a constant to initialize them. If only the default constructor is used, the only operation allowed next is to call a global atomic_init   operation as follows:  std::atomic  readyFlag; ... std::atomic_init &readyFlag,false ;  The two most important statements to deal with atomics are store   and load  :  This way of initialization is provided to be able to write code that also compiles in C  see Sec- tion 18.7.3, page 1019 .   store   assigns a new value.   load   yields the current value. The important point is that these operations are guaranteed to be atomic, so we don’t need a mutex to set the ready ﬂag, as we had to without atomics. Thus, in the ﬁrst thread, instead of  }  {  std::lock_guard  lg readyMutex ; readyFlag = true;  }    release lock  we simply can program:  readyFlag.store true ;  26 Thanks to Lawrence Crowl for pointing this out.   Chapter 18: Concurrency  1014  {  }  In the second thread, instead of  std::unique_lock  l readyFlagMutex ; while  !readyFlag  {  l.unlock  ; std::this_thread::sleep_for std::chrono::milliseconds 100  ; l.lock  ;  }  }    release lock  we have to implement only the following:  while  !readyFlag.load    {  std::this_thread::sleep_for std::chrono::milliseconds 100  ;  However, when using condition variables, we still need the mutex for consuming the condition variable:     wait until thread1 is ready  readyFlag is true  {  std::unique_lock  l readyMutex ; readyCondVar.wait l, []{ return readyFlag.load  ; } ;  }    release lock  For atomic types, you can still use the “useful,” “ordinary” operations, such as assignments, auto- matic conversions to integral types, increments, decrements, and so on:  std::atomic  ab false ; ab = true; if  ab  {  ...  }  std::atomic  ai 0 ; int x = ai; ai = 10; ai++; ai-=17;  Note, however, that to provide atomicity, some usual behavior might be slightly different. For exam- ple, the assignment operator yields the assigned value instead of a reference to the atomic the value was assigned to. See Section 18.7.2, page 1016, for details.  Let’s look at a complete example using atomics:     concurrency atomics1.cpp  include   include       for atomics    for async   and futures   18.7 Atomics  1015  include   include   include       for this_thread    for durations  long data; std::atomic  readyFlag false ;  void provider    {     after reading a character std::cout  " << std::endl; std::cin.get  ;     provide some data data = 42;     and signal readiness readyFlag.store true ;  void consumer    {     wait for readiness and do something else while  !readyFlag.load    {  }  }  }  }  int main   {  std::cout.put ’.’ .flush  ; std::this_thread::sleep_for std::chrono::milliseconds 500  ;     and process provided data std::cout << "\nvalue : " << data << std::endl;     start provider and consumer auto p = std::async std::launch::async,provider ; auto c = std::async std::launch::async,consumer ;  Here, thread provider   ﬁrst provides some data and then uses a store   to signal that the data is provided:  data = 42; readyFlag.store true ;     provide some data    and signal readiness   1016  Chapter 18: Concurrency  The store   operation performs a so-called release operation on the affected memory location, which by default ensures that all prior memory operations, whether atomic or not, become visible to other threads before the effect of the store operation.  Accordingly, thread consumer   performs a loop of load  s and processes data then: while  !readyFlag.load    {     loop until ready  ...  } std::cout << data << std::endl;     and process provided data  The load   operation performs a so-called acquire operation on the affected memory location, which by default ensures that all following memory operations, whether atomic or not, become visible to other threads after the load operation.  As a consequence, because the setting of data happens before the provider   stores true in the readyFlag and the processing of data happens after the consumer   has loaded true as value of the readyFlag, the processing of data is guaranteed to happen after the data was provided.  This guarantee is provided because in all atomic operations, we use a default memory order named memory_order_seq_cst, which stands for sequential consistent memory order. With low- level atomics operations, we are able to relax this order guarantee  see Section 18.7.4, page 1019, for details .  18.7.2 Atomics and Their High-Level Interface in Detail  In  , the class template std::atomic  provides the general abilities of atomic data types. It can be used for any trivial type. Specializations are provided for bool, all integral types, and pointers:  template  struct atomic; template  struct atomic ; template  struct atomic ; ... template  struct atomic ;     primary class template    explicit specializations     partial specialization for pointers  Table 18.11 lists the high-level operations provided for atomics. If possible, they map directly to corresponding CPU instructions. Column triv ﬂags operations provided for std::atomic  and atomics of other trivial types; column int type ﬂags operations provided for std::atomic , if an integral type is used; and column ptr type ﬂags operations provided for std::atomic , if a pointer type is used.   In general, operations yield copies rather than references.   The default constructor does not initialize a variable object completely. The only legal operation after default construction is calling atomic_init   to initialize the object  see Section 18.7.1, page 1013 .  Note a couple of remarks regarding this table:    The constructor for a value of the corresponding type is not atomic.   All functions except constructors are overloaded for volatile and non-volatile.   1017  18.7 Atomics  Operation  atomic a=val  triv int  ptr Effect  type type Yes Yes Yes  Initializes a with val  not an atomic operation   not initialized  true if type internally does not use locks  atomic a; atomic_init &a,val   Yes Yes Yes Ditto  without atomic_init  , a is  a.is_lock_free    Yes Yes Yes  a.store val  a.load   a.exchange val   Yes Yes Yes Assigns val  returns void  Yes Yes Yes Returns copy of the value of a Yes Yes Yes Assigns val and returns copy of old  value of a  a.compare_exchange_strong exp, Yes Yes Yes CAS operation  see below   des   Yes Yes Yes Weak CAS operation  a.compare_exchange_weak exp, des   a = val a.operator atomic   a.fetch_add val   a.fetch_sub val   Yes Yes Atomic t-=val  returns copy of new  Yes Yes Yes Assigns and returns copy of val Yes Yes Yes Returns copy of the value of a  Yes Yes Atomic t+=val  returns copy of new  value   value   Yes Yes Same as t.fetch_add val  Yes Yes Same as t.fetch_sub val  Yes Yes Calls t.fetch_add 1  and returns  copy of a or a+1  Yes Yes Calls t.fetch_sub 1  and returns  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes Yes Yes  copy of a or a-1 Atomic a&=val  returns copy of new value  Atomic a=val  returns copy of new value  Atomic a^=val  returns copy of new value  Same as a.fetch_and val  Same as a.fetch_or val  Same as a.fetch_xor val   a += val a -= val ++a, a++  --a, a--  a.fetch_and val   a.fetch_or val   a.fetch_xor val   a &= val a = val a ^= val  Table18.11. High-LevelOperationsofAtomics   1018  Chapter 18: Concurrency  For example, for atomic , the following assignment operations are declared:  namespace std {     specialization of std::atomic  for int: template  struct atomic  {  public:     ordinary assignment operators are not provided: atomic& operator= const atomic&  = delete; atomic& operator= const atomic&  volatile = delete;    but assignment of an int is provided, which yields the passed argument: int operator=  int  volatile noexcept; int operator=  int  noexcept; ...  };  }  With is_lock_free  , you can check whether an atomic type internally uses locks to be atomic. If not, you have native hardware support for the atomic operations  which is a prerequisite for using atomics in signal handlers .  Both compare_exchange_strong   and compare_exchange_weak   are so-called compare- and-swap  CAS  operations. CPUs often provide this atomic operation to compare the contents of a memory location to a given value and, only if they are the same, modify the contents of that memory location to a given new value. This guarantees that the new value is calculated based on up-to-date information. The effect is something like the following pseudocode:  bool compare_exchange_strong  T& expected, T desired  {  if  this->load   == expected  {  this->store desired ; return true;  expected = this->load  ; return false;  } else {  }  }  Thus, if the value had been updated by another thread in the meantime, it returns false with the new value in expected.  The weak form may spuriously fail so that it returns false even when the expected value is  present. But the weak form is sometimes more efﬁcient than the strong version.   18.7 Atomics  1019  18.7.3 The C-Style Interface of Atomics  For the atomic proposal for C++, there was a corresponding proposal for C, which should provide the same semantics but could, of course, not use such speciﬁc C++ features as templates, references, and member functions. Therefore, the whole atomic interface has a C-style equivalent, which also was proposed as an extension to the C standard.  For example, you can also declare an atomic  as atomic_bool, and instead of store    and load  , you can use global functions, which use a pointer to the object:  std::atomic_bool ab; std::atomic_init &ab,false ; ... std::atomic_store &ab,true ; ... if  std::atomic_load &ab   {  ...  }     equivalent to: std::atomic  ab    see Section 18.7.1, page 1013     equivalent to: ab.store true      equivalent to: if  ab.load     However, C added another interface, using _Atomic and _Atomic  , so the C-style interface in general is useful only for code that needs to be both C and C++ compilable in the nearer term.  However, using the C-style atomic types is pretty common in C++. Table 18.12 lists the most im- There are more provided for less common types, such as  portant atomic type names. atomic_int_fast32_t for atomic .  Note that for shared pointers  see Section 5.2.1, page 76  special atomic operations are provided. The reason is that a declaration, such as atomic >, is not possible, because a shared pointer is not trivially copyable. The atomic operations follow the naming conventions of the C-style interface. See Section 5.2.4, page 96, for details.  18.7.4 The Low-Level Interface of Atomics  The low-level interface of atomics means using the atomic operations in a way that we have no guaranteed sequential consistency. Thus, compilers and hardware might  partially  reorder access on atomics  see Section 18.4.3, page 986 .  Beware again: Although I give an example, this area is a mineﬁeld. You need a lot of expertise to know when memory reorderings are worth the effort, and even experts often make mistakes in this area.27  An expert using this feature should be familiar with the material mentioned in [N2480:MemMod]  and [BoehmAdve:MemMod] or, in general, all material listed at [Boehm:C++MM].  27 Special thanks to Hans Boehm and Bartosz Milewski for their support in letting me understand this and their help in providing the right wording. Any ﬂaws are my fault.   1020  Chapter 18: Concurrency  Named Type atomic_bool atomic_char atomic_schar atomic_uchar atomic_short atomic_ushort atomic_int atomic_uint atomic_long atomic_ulong atomic_llong atomic_ullong atomic_char16_t atomic_char32_t atomic_wchar_t atomic_intptr_t atomic_uintptr_t atomic_size_t atomic_ptrdiff_t atomic_intmax_t atomic_uintmax_t  Corresponding Type atomic  atomic  atomic  atomic  atomic  atomic  atomic  atomic  atomic  atomic  atomic  atomic  atomic  atomic  atomic  atomic  atomic  atomic  atomic  atomic  atomic   Table18.12. SomeNamedTypesofstd::atomic   An Example for the Low-Level Interface of Atomics  Consider the second example for using atomics, introduced in Section 18.7.1, page 1014, where we declared an atomic ﬂag to control access to some data:  long data; std::atomic  readyFlag false ;  and a thread providing the data:  data = 42; readyFlag.store true ; and a thread consuming the data:     provide some data    and signal readiness  while  !readyFlag.load    {     loop until ready  ...  } std::cout << data << std::endl;     and process provided data  Because we use the default memory order, which guarantees sequential consistency, this works as described in Section 18.7.1, page 1015. In fact, what we really call is:   18.7 Atomics  1021  and  and  data = 42; readyFlag.store true,std::memory_order_seq_cst ;  while  !readyFlag.load std::memory_order_seq_cst   {  } std::cout << data << std::endl;  ...  ...  ...  Thus, each operation has an optional argument to pass the memory order, which by default is std::memory_order_seq_cst  sequential consistent memory order .  By passing other values as memory order, we can weaken the order guarantees. In our case, it is, for example, enough to require that the provider not delay operations past the atomic store and that the consumer not bring forward operations following the atomic load:  data = 42; readyFlag.store true,std::memory_order_release ;  while  !readyFlag.load std::memory_order_acquire   {  } std::cout << data << std::endl;  However, relaxing all constraints on the order of atomic operations would result in undeﬁned behavior:     ERROR: undeﬁned behavior: data = 42; readyFlag.store true,std::memory_order_relaxed ;  The reason is that std::memory_order_relaxed doesn’t guarantee that all prior memory oper- ations become visible to other threads before the effect of the store operation. Thus, the provider might write data after setting the ready ﬂag, so the consumer might read data while it gets written, which is a data race.  Note that you could also make data atomic and use std::memory_order_relaxed as memory  order:  std::atomic  data 0 ; std::atomic  readyFlag false ;     providing thread: data.store 42,std::memory_order_relaxed ; readyFlag.store true,std::memory_order_relaxed ;     consuming thread: while  !readyFlag.load std::memory_order_relaxed   {  } std::cout << data.load std::memory_order_relaxed  << std::endl;   1022  Chapter 18: Concurrency  Strictly speaking, this is not undeﬁned behavior, because we don’t have a data race. However, this also would not work as expected, because the resulting value of data might not be 42 yet  the memory order is still not guaranteed . It’s behavior that results in data having an unspeciﬁed value. Using memory_order_relaxed would be useful only if we have atomic variables where reads and or writes are independent of one another. An example would be a global counter, which different threads might increment or decrement and where we need only the ﬁnal value after all threads ended.  Overview of Low-Level Operations  Table 18.13 lists the supplementary low-level operations provided for atomics.

SupplementaryLow-LevelOperationsofAtomics  Some additional functions are provided to manually control memory access. For example, atomic_thread_fence   and atomic_signal_fence   are provided to manually program fences, which are barriers for memory-access reordering.  No More Details  I don’t explain these low-level interfaces in more detail because this feature is for real concurrency experts or those who want to become experts. So, you should deﬁnitely use speciﬁc resources for that.  One good starting point  is Anthony Williams book C++ Concurrency in Action  see [Williams:C++Conc] , especially Chapters 5 and 7. Another is Hans Boehm’s list of URLs for material about memory models  see [Boehm:C++MM] .   Chapter 19 Allocators  Allocators, introduced in Section 4.6, page 57, represent a special memory model and are an abstrac- tion used to translate the need to use memory into a raw call for memory. This chapter describes allocators and corresponding low-level features to deal with memory. Details are provided in a sup- plementary section of the book, available at the book’s Web site: http:  www.cppstdlib.com.  19.1 Using Allocators as an Application Programmer  For the application programmer, using different allocators should be no problem. You simply have to pass the allocator as a template argument. For example, the following statements create different containers and strings, using the special allocator MyAlloc :     a vector with special allocator std::vector > v;     an int ﬂoat map with special allocator std::map ,  MyAlloc >> m;     a string with special allocator std::basic_string ,MyAlloc > s;  If you use your own allocator, it probably is a good idea to make some type deﬁnitions. For example:     special string type that uses special allocator typedef std::basic_string ,  MyAlloc > MyString;     special string string map type that uses special allocator typedef std::map ,  MyAlloc >> MyMap;   1024  Chapter 19: Allocators     create object of this type MyMap mymap;  Since C++11, you can use alias templates  template typedefs; see Section 3.1.9, page 27  to deﬁne the allocator type while leaving the element type open:  template   using Vec = std::vector >;     vector using own allocator  Vec  coll;     equivalent to: std::vector >  When you use objects with other than the default allocator, you’ll see no difference.  You can check whether two allocators use the same memory model by using operators == and !=. If it returns true, you can deallocate storage allocated from one allocator via the other. To access the allocator, all types that are parametrized by an allocator provide the member function get_allocator  . For example:  if  mymap.get_allocator   ==  s.get_allocator    {     OK, mymap and s use the same or interchangeable allocators ...  }  In addition, since C++11, a type trait  see Section 5.4, page 122  is provided to check whether a type T has an allocator_type, which a passed allocator may be converted into:  std::uses_allocator ::value     true if Alloc is convertible    into T::allocator_type  19.2 A User-Deﬁned Allocator  Allocators provide an interface to allocate, create, destroy, and deallocate objects  Table 19.1 . With allocators, containers and algorithms can be parametrized based on the way the elements are stored. For example, you could implement allocators that use shared memory or that map the elements to a persistent database.  Expression a.allocate num  a.construct p,val  a.destroy p  a.deallocate p,num  Deallocates memory for num elements to which p refers  Effect Allocates memory for num elements Initializes the element to which p refers with val Destroys the element to which p refers  Table19.1. FundamentalAllocatorOperations  Writing your own allocator is not very hard. The most important issue is how you allocate or deallocate the storage. For the rest, appropriate defaults are usually provided since C++11.  Before C++11, you had to implement the rest in a pretty obvious way.  As an example, let’s look at an allocator that behaves just like the default allocator:   19.2 A User-Deﬁned Allocator  1025     alloc myalloc11.hpp  include       for size_t  template   class MyAlloc {  public:     type deﬁnitions typedef T value_type;     constructors    - nothing to do because the allocator has no state MyAlloc    noexcept { } template   MyAlloc  const MyAlloc &  noexcept {     no state to copy  }  }  }  };     allocate but don’t initialize num elements of type T T* allocate  std::size_t num  {    allocate memory with global new return static_cast  ::operator new num*sizeof T   ;     deallocate storage p of deleted elements void deallocate  T* p, std::size_t num  {     deallocate memory with global delete ::operator delete p ;     return that all specializations of this allocator are interchangeable template   bool operator==  const MyAlloc &,  const MyAlloc &  noexcept {  return true;  } template   bool operator!=  const MyAlloc &,  const MyAlloc &  noexcept {  return false;  }   1026  Chapter 19: Allocators  As the example demonstrates, you have to provide the following features:   A type deﬁnition of the value_type, which is nothing but the passed template parameter type.   A constructor.   A template constructor, which copies the internal state while changing the type. Note that a template constructor does not suppress the implicit declaration of the copy constructor  see Sec- tion 3.2, page 36 .    A member allocate  , which provides new memory.   A member deallocate  , which releases memory that is no longer needed.   Constructors and a destructor, if necessary, to initialize, copy, and clean up the internal state.   Operators == and !=. You don’t have to provide construct   or destroy  , because their default implementations usu- ally work ﬁne  using placement new to initialize the memory and calling the destructor explicitly to clean it up .  Using this base implementation, you should ﬁnd it easy to implement your own allocator. You can use the core functions allocate   and deallocate   to implement your own policy of mem- ory allocation, such as reusing memory instead of freeing it immediately, using shared memory, mapping the memory to a segment of an object-oriented database, or just debugging memory allo- cations. In addition, you might provide corresponding constructors and a destructor to provide and release what allocate   and deallocate   need to fulﬁll their task.  Note that before C++11, you had to provide a lot more members, which, however, were easy to provide. See alloc myalloc03.hpp for a corresponding complete example, which is also covered in the supplementary section about allocator details at http:  www.cppstdlib.com.  19.3 Using Allocators as a Library Programmer  This section describes the use of allocators from the viewpoint of people who use allocators to implement containers and other components that are able to handle different allocators. This section is based, with permission, partly on Section 19.4 of Bjarne Stroustrup’s The C++ Programming Language, 3rd edition  see [Stroustrup:C++] .  As an example, let’s look at a naive implementation of a vector. A vector gets its allocator as a  template or a constructor argument and stores it somewhere internally:  namespace std {  template <typename T,  class vector {  ...  private:  typename Allocator = allocator  >  Allocator alloc; T* elems; size_type numElems; size_type sizeElems;    size of memory for the elements ...     allocator    array of elements    number of elements   19.3 Using Allocators as a Library Programmer  1027  public:     constructors explicit vector const Allocator& = Allocator   ; explicit vector size_type num, const T& val = T  ,  const Allocator& = Allocator   ;  template   vector InputIterator beg, InputIterator end,  const Allocator& = Allocator   ;  vector const vector & v ; ...  };  }  namespace std {  The second constructor that initializes the vector by num elements of value val could be imple- mented as follows:  template   vector ::vector size_type num, const T& val,  const Allocator& a   : alloc a      initialize allocator  {     allocate memory sizeElems = numElems = num; elems = alloc.allocate num ;     initialize elements for  size_type i=0; i<num; ++i  {     initialize ith element alloc.construct &elems[i],val ;  }  }  }  Expression uninitialized_fill beg,end,val  uninitialized_fill_n beg,num,val   uninitialized_copy beg,end,mem   uninitialized_copy_n beg,num,mem   Effect Initializes [beg,end  with val Initializes num elements starting from beg with val Initialize the elements starting from mem with the elements of [beg,end  Initialize num elements starting from mem with the elements starting from beg  since C++11   Table19.2. ConvenienceFunctionsforUninitializedMemory   1028  Chapter 19: Allocators  However, for the initialization of uninitialized memory, the C++ standard library provides some convenience functions  Table 19.2 . The implementation of the constructor becomes even simpler using these functions:  namespace std {  template   vector ::vector size_type num, const T& val,  const Allocator& a   : alloc a      initialize allocator  The member function reserve  , which reserves more memory without changing the number of elements  see Section 7.3.1, page 271 , could be implemented as follows:  {  }  }     allocate memory sizeElems = numElems = num; elems = alloc.allocate num ;     initialize elements uninitialized_fill_n elems, num, val ;  namespace std {  template   void vector ::reserve size_type size  {     reserve   never shrinks the memory if  size <= sizeElems  {  return;  }  }     allocate new memory for size elements T* newmem = alloc.allocate size ;     copy old elements into new memory uninitialized_copy elems,elems+numElems,newmem ;     destroy old elements for  size_type i=0; i<numElems; ++i  {  alloc.destroy &elems[i] ;     deallocate old memory alloc.deallocate elems,sizeElems ;   19.3 Using Allocators as a Library Programmer  1029     so, now we have our elements in the new memory sizeElems = size; elems = newmem;  }  }  Raw Storage Iterators  In addition, class raw_storage_iterator is provided to iterate over uninitialized memory to ini- tialize it. Therefore, you can use any algorithms with a raw_storage_iterator to initialize mem- ory with the values that are the result of that algorithm.  For example, the following statement initializes the storage to which elems refers by the values  in range [x.begin  ,x.end   :  copy  x.begin  , x.end  ,  raw_storage_iterator  elems  ;     source    destination  The ﬁrst template argument  T*, here  has to be an output iterator for the type of the elements. The second template argument  T, here  has to be the type of the elements.  In code, you might also ﬁnd the get_temporary_buffer   and return_temporary_buffer  . They are provided to handle uninitialized memory that is provided for short, temporary use inside a function. Note that get_temporary_buffer   might return less memory than expected. There- fore, get_temporary_buffer   returns a pair containing the address of the memory and the size of the memory  in element units . Here is an example of how to use it:  Temporary Buffers  void f   {     allocate memory for num elements of type MyType pair  p  = get_temporary_buffer  num ;  if  p.second == 0  {     could not allocate any memory for elements ...  } else if  p.second < num  {     could not allocate enough memory for num elements    however, don’t forget to deallocate it ...  }     do your processing ...   1030  }  }     free temporarily allocated memory, if any if  p.first != 0  {  return_temporary_buffer p.first ;  Chapter 19: Allocators  However, it is rather complicated to write exception-safe code with get_temporary_buffer   and return_temporary_buffer  , so they are usually no longer used in library implementations.

C and old C++ programs usually use type long for arrays of bits and manipulate them with the bit operators, such as &, , and ~. The class bitset has the advantage that bitsets may contain any number of bits, and additional operations are provided. For example, you can assign single bits and can read and write bitsets as a sequence of 0s and 1s.  Note that you can’t change the number of bits in a bitset. The number of bits is the template parameter. If you need a container for a variable number of bits or Boolean values, you can use the class vector   described in Section 7.3.6, page 281 . The class bitset is deﬁned in the header ﬁle  : include    In  , the class bitset is deﬁned as a class template, with the number of bits as the template parameter:  namespace std {  template   class bitset;  }  In this case, the template parameter is not a type but an unsigned integral value  see Section 3.2, page 33, for details about this language feature .  Templates with different template arguments are different types. You can compare and combine  bitsets only with the same number of bits.  Recent Changes with C++11  C++98 speciﬁed almost all features of bitsets. Here is a list of the most important features added with C++11:   Bitsets now can be initialized by string literals  see Section 12.5.1, page 653 .   Conversions to and from numeric values now support type unsigned long long. For this,   Conversions to and from strings now allow you to specify the character interpreted as set and   Member all   is now provided to check whether all bits are set.   To use bitsets in unordered containers, a default hash function is provided  see Section 7.9.2,  to_ullong   was introduced  see Section 12.5.1, page 653 .  unset bit.  page 363 .  Nicolai M. Josuttis: The C++ Standard Library, 2nd Edition   1104  Supplementary Chapter  S.1.1 Examples of Using Bitsets  Using Bitsets as Sets of Flags  The ﬁrst example demonstrates how to use bitsets to manage a set of ﬂags. Each ﬂag has a value that is deﬁned by an enumeration type. The value of the enumeration type is used as the position of the bit in the bitset. In particular, the bits represent colors. Thus, each enumeration value deﬁnes one color. By using a bitset, you can manage variables that might contain any combination of colors:     contadapt bitset1.cpp  include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {     enumeration type for the bits    - each bit represents a color enum Color { red, yellow, green, blue, white, black, ...,  numColors };     create bitset for all bits colors bitset  usedColors;     set bits for two colors usedColors.set red ; usedColors.set blue ;     print some bitset data cout << "bitfield of used colors: cout << "number of used colors: cout << "bitfield of unused colors: " << ~usedColors << endl;  " << usedColors << endl; " << usedColors.count   << endl;     if any color is used if  usedColors.any    {     loop over all colors for  int c = 0; c < numColors; ++c  {     if the actual color is used if  usedColors[ Color c]  {  ...  }  }  }  }  Nicolai M. Josuttis: The C++ Standard Library, 2nd Edition   S.1 Bitsets  1105  Using Bitsets for I O with Binary Representation  A useful feature of bitsets is the ability to convert integral values into a sequence of bits, and vice versa. This is done simply by creating a temporary bitset:     contadapt bitset2.cpp  include   include   include   include   using namespace std;  int main   {     print some numbers in binary representation cout << "267 as binary short: "   ::digits> 267  << endl;  cout << "267 as binary long:  "   ::digits> 267  << endl;  cout << "10,000,000 with 24 bits: "    1e7  << endl;     write binary representation into string string s = bitset  12345678 .to_string  ; cout << "12,345,678 with 42 bits: " << s << endl;     transform binary representation into integral number cout << "\"1000101011\" as number:  "    "1000101011" .to_ullong   << endl;  }  Depending on the number of bits for short and long long, the program might produce the follow- ing output:  267 as binary short: 267 as binary long: 10,000,000 with 24 bits: 100110001001011010000000 12,345,678 with 42 bits: 000000000000000000101111000110000101001110 "1000101011" as number:  0000000100001011 00000000000000000000000100001011  555  Nicolai M. Josuttis: The C++ Standard Library, 2nd Edition   1106  Supplementary Chapter  In this example, the following expression converts 267 into a bitset with the number of bits of type unsigned short  see Section 5.3, page 116, for a discussion of numeric limits :  bitset ::digits> 267   The output operator for bitset prints the bits as a sequence of characters 0 and 1.  You can output bitsets directly or use their value as a string: string s = bitset  12345678 .to_string  ;  Note that before C++11, you had to write  string s = bitset  12345678 .to_string ,  allocator  >  ;  here because to_string   is a member template, and there were no default values for the template arguments deﬁned.  Similarly, the following expression converts a sequence of binary characters into a bitset, for  which to_ullong   yields the integral value:  bitset  "1000101011"   Note that the number of bits in the bitset should be smaller than sizeof unsigned long long . The reason is that you get an exception when the value of the bitset can’t be represented as unsigned long long.1  Note also that before C++11, you had to convert the initial value to type string explicitly: bitset  string "1000101011"    1 Before C++11, to_ulong   is still callable if the number of bits is smaller than sizeof unsigned long .  type unsigned long was not provided, so you could call only to_ulong   here.  Nicolai M. Josuttis: The C++ Standard Library, 2nd Edition   S.1 Bitsets  1107  For bitsets, some special constructors are deﬁned. However, no special copy constructor, assignment operator, or destructor is deﬁned. Thus, bitsets are assigned and copied with the default operations that copy bitwise.  S.1.2 Class bitset  in Detail  The bitset class provides the following operations.  Create, Copy, and Destroy Operations  bitset ::bitset      The default constructor.   Creates a bitset with all bits initialized with zero.   For example:  bitset  flags;     ﬂags: 0000...000000    thus, 50 unset bits  bitset ::bitset  unsigned long long value    Creates a bitset that is initialized according to the bits of the integral value value.   If the number of bits of value is too small, the leading bit positions are initialized to zero.   Before C++11, the type of value was unsigned long.   For example:  bitset  flags 7 ;     ﬂags: 0000...000111  explicit bitset ::bitset  const string& str  bitset ::bitset  const string& str, string::size_type str_idx  bitset ::bitset  const string& str,  string::size_type str_idx, string::size_type str_num   bitset ::bitset  const string& str,  string::size_type str_idx, string::size_type str_num, string::charT zero  bitset ::bitset  const string& str,  string::size_type str_idx, string::size_type str_num, string::charT zero, string::charT one     All forms create a bitset that is initialized by the string str or a substring of str.   The string or substring may contain only the characters ’0’ and ’1’ or zero and one.   str_idx is the index of the ﬁrst character of str that is used for initialization.   If str_num is missing, all characters from str_idx to the end of str are used.   If the string or substring has fewer characters than necessary, the leading bit positions are initial-  ized to zero.  Nicolai M. Josuttis: The C++ Standard Library, 2nd Edition   1108  Supplementary Chapter  nored.    If the string or substring has more characters than necessary, the remaining characters are ig-   Throw out_of_range if str_idx > str.size  .   Throw invalid_argument if one of the characters is neither ’0’ zero nor ’1’ one.   Parameters zero and one are provided since C++11.   Note that this constructor is a member template  see Section 3.2, page 34 . For this reason, no implicit type conversion from const char* to string for the ﬁrst parameter is provided, which before C++11, ruled out passing a string literal.    For example:  bitset  flags string "1010101"  ; bitset  flags string "1111000" ,2,3 ;     ﬂags: 0000...0001010101    ﬂags: 0000...0000000110  explicit bitset ::bitset  const charT* str  bitset ::bitset  const charT* str, string::size_type str_num  bitset ::bitset  const charT* str, string::size_type str_num,  string::charT zero   string::charT zero, string::charT one   bitset ::bitset  const charT* str, string::size_type str_num,   All forms create a bitset that is initialized by the character sequence str.   The string or substring may contain only the characters ’0’ and ’1’ or zero and one.   If str_num is missing, all characters of str are used.   If  str_num out of  str are fewer characters than necessary, the leading bit positions are initialized   If str has more characters than necessary, the remaining characters are ignored.   Throw invalid_argument if one of the characters is neither ’0’ zero nor ’1’ one.   Parameters zero and one are provided since C++11.

Josuttis: The C++ Standard Library, 2nd Edition   1114  S.2 Valarrays  Supplementary Chapter  Since C++98, the C++ standard library provides class valarray  for processing arrays of numeric values. A valarray is a representation of the mathematical concept of a linear sequence of values. It has one dimension, but you can get the illusion of higher dimensionality by special techniques of computed indices and powerful subsetting capabilities. Therefore, a valarray can be used as a base both for vector and matrix operations and for processing mathematical systems of polynomial equations with good performance.  The valarray classes enable some tricky optimizations to get good performance for the processing of value arrays. However, it is not clear how important this component of the C++ standard library will be in the future, because other interesting developments perform even better. One of the most interesting examples is the Blitz system. If you are interested in numeric processing, you should look at it. For details, see http:  www.oonumerics.org blitz .  The valarray classes were not designed very well. In fact, nobody tried to determine whether the ﬁnal speciﬁcation worked. This happened because nobody felt “responsible” for these classes. The people who introduced valarrays to the C++ standard library left the committee long before the ﬁrst C++ standard was ﬁnished. For example, to use valarrays, you often need some inconvenient and time-consuming type conversions  see Section S.2.2, page 1121 .  Recent Changes with C++11  operator are provided.  In fact, a move constructor and a move assignment  C++98 speciﬁed almost all features of the classes for valarrays. Here is a list of the most important features added with C++11:   Valarrays now support move semantics.   The class now provides swap   functions  see Section S.2.3, page 1137 .   You can now use an initializer list to initialize a valarray or assign new values to it  see Sec-   Class valarray now provides begin   and end   for iterating over the elements of a valarray   Operator [ ] now returns a constant reference instead of a copy  see Section S.2.3, page 1139 .   see Section S.2.1, page 1119 .  tion S.2.1, page 1116 .  S.2.1 Getting to Know Valarrays  Valarrays are one-dimensional arrays with elements numbered sequentially from zero. They provide the ability to do some numeric processing for all or a subset of the values in one or more value arrays. For example, you can process the statement  z = a*x*x + b*x + c  with a, b, c, x, and z being arrays that contain hundreds of numeric values. In doing this, you have the advantage of a simple notation. Also, the processing is done with good performance because the classes provide some optimizations that avoid the creation of temporary objects while processing the whole statement. In addition, special interfaces and auxiliary classes provide the ability to process  Nicolai M. Josuttis: The C++ Standard Library, 2nd Edition   S.2 Valarrays  1115  only a certain subset of value arrays or to do some multidimensional processing. In this way, the valarray concept also helps to implement vector and matrix operations and classes.  The standard guarantees that valarrays are alias free. That is, any value of a nonconstant valarray is accessed through a unique path. Thus, operations on these values can get optimized better because the compiler does not have to take into account that the data could be accessed through another path.  Header File  Valarrays are declared in the header ﬁle  :  include    In particular, the following classes are declared in  :  namespace std {  template  class valarray;     numeric array of type T  class slice; template  class slice_array;     slice out of a valarray  class gslice; template  class gslice_array;     a generalized slice  template  class mask_array;     a masked valarray  template  class indirect_array;    an indirect valarray  }  The classes have the following meanings:   valarray is the core class that manages an array of numeric values.   slice and gslice are provided to deﬁne a BLAS-like3 slice as a subset of a valarray.   slice_array, gslice_array, mask_array, and indirect_array are internal auxiliary classes that are used to store temporary values or data. You can’t use those classes in your programming interface directly. They are created indirectly by certain valarray operations.  All classes are templatized for the type of the elements. In principle, the type could be any data type. However, according to the nature of valarrays, it should be a numeric data type.  Creating Valarrays  When you create a valarray, you usually pass the number of elements as a parameter:    valarray of ten ints with value 0  std::valarray   va1 10 ;  3 The Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms  BLAS  library provides computational kernels for several of the fundamental linear algebra operations, such as matrix multiply, the solution of triangular systems, and simple vector operations.  Nicolai M. Josuttis: The C++ Standard Library, 2nd Edition   1116  Supplementary Chapter  std::valarray  va2 5.7,10 ;     valarray of ten floats with value 5.7     note the order   If you pass one argument, it is used as the size. The elements are initialized by the default constructor of their type. Elements of fundamental data types are initialized by zero  see Section 3.2.1, page 37, for a description of why fundamental data types may be initialized by a default constructor . If you pass a second value, the ﬁrst is used as the initial value for the elements, whereas the second speciﬁes the number of elements. Note that the order of passing two arguments to the constructor differs from that of all other classes of the C++ standard library. All STL container classes use the ﬁrst numeric argument as the number of elements and the second argument as the initial value.  Since C++11, you can also initialize a valarray with an initializer list: std::valarray  va3 = { 3, 6, 18, 3, 22 };  Before C++11, you had to use an ordinary C-style array:  int array[] = { 3, 6, 18, 3, 22 };     initialize valarray by elements of an ordinary array std::valarray  va3 array,sizeof array  sizeof array[0]  ;     initialize by the second to the fourth element std::valarray  va4 array+1,3 ;  The valarray creates copies of the passed values. Thus, you can pass temporary data for initialization.  Valarray Operations  For valarrays, the subscript operator is deﬁned to access the element of a valarray. As usual, the ﬁrst element has the index 0:  va[0] = 3 * va[1] + va[2];  In addition, all ordinary numeric operators are deﬁned: addition, subtraction, multiplication, mod- ulo, negation, bit operators, comparison operators, and logical operators, as well as all assignment operators. These operators are called for each valarray element that is processed by the operation. Thus, the result of a valarray operation is a valarray that has the same number of elements as the operands and that contains the result of the element-wise computation. For example, the statement  va1 = va2 * va3;  is equivalent to  va1[0] = va2[0] * va3[0]; va1[1] = va2[1] * va3[1]; va1[2] = va2[2] * va3[2]; ...  If the number of elements of the combined valarrays differs, the result is undeﬁned.  Of course, the operations are available only if the element’s type supports them. The exact meaning of the operation depends on the meaning of the operation for the elements. Thus, all these operations simply do the same for each element or pair of elements in the valarrays they process.  Nicolai M. Josuttis: The C++ Standard Library, 2nd Edition   S.2 Valarrays  1117  For binary operations, one of the operands may be a single value of the element’s type. In this case, the single value is combined with each element of the valarray that is used as the other operand. For example, the statement  va1 = 4 * va2;  is equivalent to  va1[0] = 4 * va2[0]; va1[1] = 4 * va2[1]; va1[2] = 4 * va2[2]; ...  Note that the type of the single value has to match exactly the element type of the valarray. Thus, the previous example works only if the element type is int. The following statement would fail:  std::valarray  va 20 ; ... va = 4 * va;     ERROR: type mismatch  The schema of binary operations also applies to comparison operators. Thus, operator == does not return a single Boolean value that shows whether both valarrays are equal. Instead, the operator returns a new valarray with the same number of elements of type bool, where each value is the result of the individual comparison. For example, in the following code  std::valarray  va1 10 ; std::valarray  va2 10 ; std::valarray  vab 10 ; ... vab =  va1 == va2 ;  the last statement is equivalent to  vab[0] =  va1[0] == va2[0] ; vab[1] =  va1[1] == va2[1] ; vab[2] =  va1[2] == va2[2] ; ... vab[9] =  va1[9] == va2[9] ;     num valarray1.cpp  include   include   using namespace std;     print valarray  Nicolai M. Josuttis: The C++ Standard Library, 2nd Edition  For this reason, you can’t sort valarrays by using operator <, and you can’t use them as elements in STL containers if the test for equality is performed with operator ==  see Section 6.11.1, page 244, for the requirements of elements of STL containers .  The following program demonstrates a simple use of valarrays:   1118  Supplementary Chapter  template   void printValarray  const valarray & va  {  for  int i=0; i<va.size  ; i++  {  cout << va[i] << ’ ’;  } cout << endl;  }  int main   {     deﬁne two valarrays with ten elements valarray  va1 10 , va2 10 ;     assign values 0.0, 1.1, up to 9.9 to the ﬁrst valarray for  int i=0; i<10; i++  {  va1[i] = i * 1.1;  }     assign -1 to all elements of the second valarray va2 = -1;     print both valarrays printValarray va1 ; printValarray va2 ;     print minimum, maximum, and sum of the ﬁrst valarray cout << "min  : " << va1.min   << endl; cout << "max  : " << va1.max   << endl; cout << "sum  : " << va1.sum   << endl;     assign values of the ﬁrst to the second valarray va2 = va1;     remove all elements of the ﬁrst valarray va1.resize 0 ;     print both valarrays again printValarray va1 ; printValarray va2 ;  }  Nicolai M. Josuttis: The C++ Standard Library, 2nd Edition   S.2 Valarrays  1119  Since C++11, you can use range-based for loops to process the elements, because valarrays provide global begin   and end   functions  see Section S.2.3, page 1139 :  The program has the following output:  0 1.1 2.2 3.3 4.4 5.5 6.6 7.7 8.8 9.9 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 min  : 0 max  : 9.9 sum  : 49.5  0 1.1 2.2 3.3 4.4 5.5 6.6 7.7 8.8 9.9     print valarray  since C++11 : template   void printValarray  const valarray & va  {  for  const T& elem: va  {  cout << elem << ’ ’;  } cout << endl;  }  Transcendental Functions  operations:     num valarray2.cpp  include   include   using namespace std;     print valarray template   void printValarray  const valarray & va  {  for  int i=0; i<va.size  ; i++  {  cout << va[i] << ’ ’;  }  Nicolai M. Josuttis: The C++ Standard Library, 2nd Edition  The transcendental operations  trigonometric and exponential  are deﬁned as equivalent to the nu- meric operators. In general, the operations are performed with all elements in the valarrays. For binary operations, one of the operands may be a single value instead, which is used as one operand, with all elements of the valarrays as the other operand.  All these operations are deﬁned as global functions instead of member functions in order to provide automatic type conversion for subsets of valarrays for both operands  subsets of valarrays are covered in Section S.2.2, page 1121 .

Josuttis: The C++ Standard Library, 2nd Edition   S.2 Valarrays  1121  S.2.2 Valarray Subsets  The subscript operator [ ] is overloaded for special auxiliary objects of valarrays. These auxiliary objects deﬁne subsets of valarrays in various ways, thus providing an elegant way to operate on certain subsets of valarrays  with both read and write access .  The subset of a valarray is deﬁned by using a certain subset deﬁnition as the index. For example: va[std::slice 2,4,3 ] va[va>7]     four elements with distance 3 starting from index 2    all elements with a value greater than 7  If a subset deﬁnition, such as std::slice 2,4,3  or va>7, is used with a constant valarray, the expression returns a new valarray with the corresponding elements. However, if such a subset def- inition is used with a nonconstant valarray, the expression returns a temporary object of a special auxiliary valarray class. This temporary object does not contain the subset values but rather the def- inition of the subset. Thus, the evaluation of expressions is deferred until the values are needed to compute a ﬁnal result.  This mechanism, called lazy evaluation, has the advantage that no temporary values for expres- sions are computed. This saves time and memory. In addition, the technique provides reference semantics. Thus, the subsets are logical sets of references to the original values. You can use these subsets as the destination  lvalue  of a statement. For example, you could assign one subset of a valarray the result of a multiplication of two other subsets of the same valarray.  However, because “temporaries” are avoided, some unexpected conditions might occur when elements in the destination subset are also used in a source subset. Therefore, any operation of valarrays is guaranteed to work only if the elements of the destination subset and the elements of all source subsets are distinct.  With smart deﬁnitions of subsets, you can give valarrays the semantics of two or more dimen-  sions. Thus, in a way, valarrays may be used as multidimensional arrays.  There are four ways to deﬁne subsets of valarrays:  1. Slices 2. General slices 3. Masked subsets 4. Indirect subsets  Valarray Subset Problems  Before discussing the individual subsets, I have to mention a general problem. The handling of valarray subsets is not well designed. You can create subsets easily, but you can’t combine them easily with other subsets. Unfortunately, you almost always need an explicit type conversion to valarray. The reason is that the C++ standard library does not specify that valarray subsets provide the same operations as valarrays.  For example, to multiply two subsets and assign the result to a third subset, you can’t write the  following:     ERROR: conversions missing va[std::slice 0,4,3 ] = va[std::slice 1,4,3 ] * va[std::slice 2,4,3 ];  Nicolai M. Josuttis: The C++ Standard Library, 2nd Edition   1122  Supplementary Chapter  Instead, you have to code by using a cast:  va[std::slice 0,4,3 ]  or by using an old-style cast:  va[std::slice 0,4,3 ]  = static_cast > va[std::slice 1,4,3 ]  *  static_cast > va[std::slice 2,4,3 ] ;  = std::valarray  va[std::slice 1,4,3 ]  *  std::valarray  va[std::slice 2,4,3 ] ;  This is tedious and error prone. Even worse, without good optimization, it may cost performance because each cast creates a temporary object, which could be avoided without the cast.  To make the handling a bit more convenient, you can use the following function template:    template to convert valarray subset into valarray template   inline std::valarray  VA  const T& valarray_subset  {  return std::valarray  valarray_subset ;  }  By using this template, you could write  va[std::slice 0,4,3 ] = VA va[std::slice 1,4,3 ]  *  VA va[std::slice 2,4,3 ] ;     OK  However, the performance penalty remains.  If you use a certain element type, you could also use a simple type deﬁnition: typedef valarray  VAD;  By using this type deﬁnition, you could also write  va[std::slice 0,4,3 ] = VAD va[std::slice 1,4,3 ]  *  VAD va[std::slice 2,4,3 ] ;     OK  provided that the elements of va have type double.  Slices  A slice deﬁnes a set of indices that has three properties: 1. The starting index 2. The number of elements  size  3. The distance between elements  stride  You can pass these three properties exactly in the same order as parameters to the constructor of class slice. For example, the following expression speciﬁes four elements, starting with index 2 with distance 3:  std::slice 2,4,3   Nicolai M. Josuttis: The C++ Standard Library, 2nd Edition   S.2 Valarrays  1123  In other words, the expression speciﬁes the following set of indices:  2  5  8 11  The stride may be negative. For example, the expression  std::slice 9,5,-2   speciﬁes the following indices:  9  7  5 3  1  To deﬁne the subset of a valarray, you simply use a slice as an argument of the subscript operator. For example, the following expression speciﬁes the subset of the valarray va that contains the elements with the indices 2, 5, 8, and 11: va[std::slice 2,4,3 ]  It’s up to the caller to ensure that all these indices are valid.  If the subset qualiﬁed by a slice is a subset of a constant valarray, the subset is a new valarray. If the valarray is nonconstant, the subset has reference semantics to the original valarray. The auxiliary class slice_array is provided for this:  namespace std {  class slice;  template   class slice_array;  template   class valarray {  public:     slice of a constant valarray returns a new valarray valarray  operator[]  slice  const;     slice of a variable valarray returns a slice_array slice_array  operator[]  slice ; ...  };  }  For slice_arrays, the following operations are deﬁned:   Assign a single value to all elements.   Assign another valarray  or valarray subset .   Call any computed assignment operation, such as operators += and *=. For any other operation, you have to convert the subset to a valarray  see Section S.2.2, page 1121 . Note that the class slice_array  is intended purely as an internal helper class for slices and should be transparent to the user. Thus, all constructors and the assignment operator of class slice_array  are private.  Nicolai M. Josuttis: The C++ Standard Library, 2nd Edition   1124  Supplementary Chapter  For example, the statement  va[std::slice 2,4,3 ] = 2;  assigns 2 to the third, sixth, ninth, and twelfth elements of the valarray va. It is equivalent to the following statements:  va[2] = 2; va[5] = 2; va[8] = 2; va[11] = 2;  As another example, the following statement squares the values of the elements with index 2, 5, 8, and 11:  va[std::slice 2,4,3 ]  *= std::valarray  va[std::slice 2,4,3 ] ;  As mentioned in Section S.2.2, page 1121, you can’t write  va[std::slice 2,4,3 ] *= va[std::slice 2,4,3 ];     ERROR  But using the VA   function template mentioned in Section S.2.2, page 1122, you can write  va[std::slice 2,4,3 ] *= VA va[std::slice 2,4,3 ] ;     OK  By passing different slices of the same valarray, you can combine different subsets and store the result in another subset of the valarray. For example, the statement  va[std::slice 0,4,3 ] = VA va[std::slice 1,4,3 ]  *  VA va[std::slice 2,4,3 ] ;  is equivalent to the following:  va[0] = va[1] va[3] = va[4] va[6] = va[7] va[9] = va[10] * va[11];  * va[2]; * va[5]; * va[8];  If you consider your valarray as a two-dimensional matrix, this example is nothing else but vector multiplication  Figure S.1 . However, note that the order of the individual assignments is not deﬁned. Therefore, the behavior is undeﬁned if the destination subset contains elements that are used in the source subsets.  In the same way, more complicated statements are possible. For example: va[std::slice 0,100,3 ]  = std::pow VA va[std::slice 1,100,3 ]  * 5.0,  VA va[std::slice 2,100,3 ]  ;  Note again that a single value, such as 5.0 in this example, has to match the element type of the valarray exactly.

Similar to slices, which provide the abil- ity to handle a subset that is one out of two dimensions, gslices allow the handling of subsets of multidimensional arrays. In principle, gslices have the same properties as slices:   Starting index   Number of elements  size    Distance between elements  stride  Unlike slices, however, the number and distance of elements in a gslice are arrays of values. The number of elements in such an array is equivalent to the number of dimensions used. For example, a gslice having the state  is equivalent to a slice because the array handles one dimension. Thus, the gslice deﬁnes four elements with distance 3, starting with index 2:  handles two dimensions. The smallest index handles the highest dimension. Thus, this gslice speci- ﬁes starting from index 2, twice with distance 10, four elements with distance 3:  2 start: size: [ 4 ] stride: [ 3 ]  2  5  8 11  However, a gslice having the state  start: size: 2 4 ] stride: [ 10 3 ]  2 [  Here is an example of a slice with three dimensions:  2 12  5 15  8 18  11 21  start: size: 2 4 ] stride: [ 30 10 3 ]  2 [  3  Nicolai M.

You can mask the elements by using a Boolean expression. For example, in the expression  Nicolai M. Josuttis: The C++ Standard Library, 2nd Edition   S.2 Valarrays  1131  returns a valarray with the size of va, where a Boolean value states whether each element is greater than 7. The subscript operator uses the Boolean valarray to specify all elements for which the Boolean expression yields true. Thus, in the valarray va,  va[va > 7]  speciﬁes the subset of elements that is greater than 7.  Apart from this, mask arrays behave the same as all valarray subsets in the following ﬁve ways: 1. To deﬁne a concrete subset of a valarray, you simply pass a valarray of Boolean values as the  2. 3.  argument to the subscript operator of the valarray. If the valarray is constant, the resulting expression is a new valarray. If the valarray is nonconstant, the resulting expression is a mask_array that represents the ele- ments of the valarray with reference semantics:  namespace std {  template   class mask_array;  template   class valarray {  public:  };  }  the elements of the subset.     num maskarray1.cpp  include   include   using namespace std;     masking a constant valarray returns a new valarray valarray  operator[]  const valarray &  const;     masking a variable valarray returns a mask_array mask_array  operator[]  const valarray & ; ...  4. For mask_array, the assignment and computed assignment operators are provided to modify  5. By using type conversions, you can combine a mask array with other valarrays and subsets of  valarrays  see Section S.2.2, page 1121 .  The following program demonstrates the use of masked subsets of valarrays:     print valarray line-by-line template   void printValarray  const valarray & va, int num  {  for  int i=0; i<va.size   num; ++i  {  Nicolai M.

Here, you simply deﬁne the subset of a valarray by passing an array of indices. Note that the indices that specify the subset don’t have to be sorted and may occur twice.  Apart from this, indirect arrays behave the same as all valarray subsets in the following ﬁve ways:  1. To deﬁne a concrete subset of a valarray, you simply pass a valarray of elements of type size_t  2. 3.  as the argument to the subscript operator of the valarray. If the valarray is constant, the resulting expression is a new valarray. If the valarray is nonconstant, the resulting expression is an indirect_array that represents the elements of the valarray with reference semantics:  namespace std {  template   class indirect_array;  template   class valarray {  public:     indexing a constant valarray returns a new valarray valarray  operator[]  const valarray &  const;     indexing a variable valarray returns an indirect_array indirect_array  operator[]  const valarray & ; ...  };  }  4. For indirect_array, the assignment and computed assignment operators are provided to mod-  ify the elements of the subset.  5. By using type conversions, you can combine an indirect array with other valarrays and subsets  of valarrays  see Section S.2.2, page 1121 .  Nicolai M.

Josuttis: The C++ Standard Library, 2nd Edition   1136  Supplementary Chapter  S.2.3 Class valarray in Detail  The class template valarray  is the core part of the valarray component. It is parametrized by the type of the elements:  namespace std {  template   class valarray;  }  The size is not part of the type. Thus, in principle, you can process valarrays with different sizes and can change the size. However, changing the size of a valarray is provided only to make a two-step initialization  creating and setting the size , which is necessary to manage arrays of valarrays. Note that the result of combining valarrays of different size is undeﬁned.  Create, Copy, and Destroy Operations  valarray::valarray      The default constructor.   Creates an empty valarray.   This constructor is provided only to enable the creation of arrays of valarrays. The next step is  to give them the correct size by using the resize   member function.  explicit valarray::valarray  size_t num    Creates a valarray that contains num elements.   The elements are initialized by their default constructors, which is 0 for fundamental data types.  valarray::valarray  initializer-list    Creates a valarray that contains the values of initializer-list.   Available since C++11.  valarray::valarray  const T& value, size_t num    Creates a valarray that contains num elements.   The elements are initialized by value.   Note that the order of parameters is unusual. All other classes of the C++ standard library provide  an interface in which num is the ﬁrst parameter and value is the second parameter.  valarray::valarray  const T* array, size_t num    Creates a valarray that contains num elements.   The elements are initialized by the values of the elements in array.   The caller must ensure that array contains num elements; otherwise, the behavior is undeﬁned.  Nicolai M. Josuttis: The C++ Standard Library, 2nd Edition   S.2 Valarrays  1137  valarray::valarray  const valarray& va  valarray::valarray  valarray&& va    The copy and move constructor.   Creates a valarray as a copy of va or with the elements of va moved.   The move constructor is provided since C++11.  valarray::˜valarray      The destructor.   Destroys all elements and frees the memory. In addition, you can create valarrays initialized by objects of the internal auxiliary classes slice_array, gslice_array, mask_array, and indirect_array. See pages 1142, 1144, 1145, and 1146, respectively, for details about these classes.  Assignment Operations  valarray& valarray::operator =  const valarray& va  valarray& valarray::operator =  valarray&& va    Copy or move assigns the elements of the valarray va.   If va has a different size, the behavior is undeﬁned.   The value of an element on the left side of any valarray assignment operator should not depend on the value of another element on that left side. In other words, if an assignment overwrites values that are used on the right side of the assignment, the result is undeﬁned. This means that you should not use an element on the left side anywhere in the expression on the right side. The reason is that the order of the evaluation of valarray statements is not deﬁned. See Section S.2.2, page 1124, and Section S.2.2, page 1121, for details.    The move assignment operator is provided since C++11.  void valarray::swap  valarray& va2  void swap  valarray& va1, valarray& va2    Both forms swap the value of two valarrays:  – The member function swaps the contents of *this and va2. – The global function swaps the contents of va1 and va2.    If possible, you should prefer these functions over assignment because they are faster. In fact,   Provided since C++11.  they are guaranteed to have constant complexity.  valarray& valarray::operator =  initializer-list    Assigns the values of initializer-list.   Returns *this.   Available since C++11.  Nicolai M. Josuttis: The C++ Standard Library, 2nd Edition   1138  Supplementary Chapter  valarray& valarray::operator =  const T& value    Assigns value to each element of the valarray.   The size of the valarray is not changed. Pointers and references to the elements remain valid. In addition, you can assign values of the internal auxiliary classes slice_array, gslice_array, mask_array, and indirect_array. See pages 1142, 1144, 1145, and 1146, respectively, for details about these classes.  Member Functions  Class valarray provides the following member functions.  size_t valarray::size    const   Returns the current number of elements.  void valarray::resize  size_t num  void valarray::resize  size_t num, T value    Both forms change the size of the valarray to num.   If the size grows, the new elements are initialized by their default constructor or with value,   Both forms invalidate all pointers and references to elements of the valarray.   These functions are provided only to enable the creation of arrays of valarrays. After creating them with the default constructor, you should give them the correct size by calling this function.  respectively.  T valarray::min    const T valarray::max    const   The ﬁrst form returns the minimum value of all elements.   The second form returns the maximum value of all elements.   The elements are compared with operator  , respectively. Thus, these operators must be   If the valarray contains no elements, the return value is undeﬁned.  provided for the element type.  T valarray::sum    const   Returns the sum of all elements.   The elements are processed by operator +=. Thus, this operator has to be provided for the element   If the valarray contains no elements, the return value is undeﬁned.  type.  valarray valarray::shift  int num  const   Returns a new valarray in which all elements are shifted by num positions.   The returned valarray has the same number of elements.   Elements of positions that were shifted are initialized by their default constructor.  Nicolai M. Josuttis: The C++ Standard Library, 2nd Edition   S.2 Valarrays  1139    The direction of the shifting depends on the sign of num:  – If num is positive, it shifts to the left front. Thus, elements get a smaller index. – If num is negative, it shifts to the right back. Thus, elements get a higher index.  valarray valarray::cshift  int num  const   Returns a new valarray in which all elements are shifted cyclically by num positions.   The returned valarray has the same number of elements.   The direction of the shifting depends on the sign of num:  – If num is positive, it shifts to the left front. Thus, elements get a smaller index or are inserted  – If num is negative, it shifts to the right back. Thus, elements get a higher index or are inserted  at the back.  at the front.  valarray valarray::apply  T op T   const valarray valarray::apply  T op const T&   const   Both forms return a new valarray with all elements processed by op  .

The nonconstant version returns a reference. So, you can modify the element that is speciﬁed and returned by this operator. The reference is guaranteed to be valid as long as the valarray exists, and no function is called that modiﬁes the size of the valarray.

Valarray Operators  Unary valarray operators have the following format:  valarray valarray::unary-op    const   A unary operator returns a new valarray that contains all values of *this modiﬁed by unary-op.   unary-op may be any of the following:    The return type for operator ! is valarray .

Nicolai M. Josuttis: The C++ Standard Library, 2nd Edition   S.2 Valarrays  1141  The logical and comparison operators follow the same schema. However, their return values are a valarray of Boolean values:  valarray  logical-op  const valarray& va1, const valarray& va2  valarray  logical-op  const valarray& va, const T& value  valarray  logical-op  const T& value, const valarray& va    These operators return a new valarray with the same number of elements as va, va1, or va2.

Similarly, computed assignment operators are deﬁned for valarrays:  valarray& valarray::assign-op  const valarray& va  valarray& valarray::assign-op  const T& value    Both forms call for each element in *this assign-op with the corresponding element of va or   They return a reference to the modiﬁed valarray.   assign-op may be any of the following:  value, respectively, as the second operand.  operator == operator != operator < operator <= operator > operator >= operator && operator   operator += operator -= operator *= operator  = operator %= operator &= operator = operator ^= operator <<= operator >>=    If *this and va2 have different numbers of elements, the result is undeﬁned.

The new valarray contains the result of the corresponding operation called for each element or pair of elements.    If va1 and va2 have different numbers of elements, the result is undeﬁned.  S.2.4 Valarray Subset Classes in Detail  This subsection describes the subset classes for valarray in detail. However, these classes are very simple and do not provide many operations. For this reason, I provide only their declarations and a few remarks.  Objects of class slice_array are created by using a slice as the index of a nonconstant valarray:  Class slice and Class slice_array  namespace std {  template   class valarray {  Nicolai M. Josuttis: The C++ Standard Library, 2nd Edition   S.2 Valarrays  1143  public:  ... slice_array  operator[] slice ; ...  The exact deﬁnition of the public interface of class slice is as follows:  slice   ; slice  size_t start, size_t size, size_t stride ;     empty subset  };  }  namespace std {  class slice {  public:  size_t start   size_t size   const; size_t stride   const;  const;  };  }  template   class slice_array {  public:  typedef T value_type;  The default constructor creates an empty subset. With the start  , size  , and stride   member functions, you can query the properties of a slice.  The class slice_array provides the following operations: namespace std {  void operator=  const T& ; void operator=  const valarray &  const; void operator*=  const valarray &  const; void operator =  const valarray &  const; void operator%=  const valarray &  const; void operator+=  const valarray &  const; void operator-=  const valarray &  const; void operator^=  const valarray &  const; void operator&=  const valarray &  const; void operator=  const valarray &  const; void operator &  const; void operator>>= const valarray &  const; ~slice_array  ;  private:  slice_array  ;  Nicolai M. Josuttis: The C++ Standard Library, 2nd Edition   1144  Supplementary Chapter  slice_array const slice_array& ; slice_array& operator= const slice_array& ; ...  };  }  Note that class slice_array  is intended purely as an internal helper class for slices and should be transparent to the user. Thus, all constructors and the assignment operator of class slice_array  are private.  Class gslice and Class gslice_array  Objects of class gslice_array are created by using a gslice as the index of a nonconstant valar- ray:  namespace std {  template   class valarray {  public:  };  }  namespace std {  class gslice {  public:  ... gslice_array  operator[] const gslice& ; ...  The exact deﬁnition of the public interface of gslice is as follows:  gslice   ; gslice  size_t start,     empty subset  const valarray & size, const valarray & stride ;  size_t start   const; valarray  size   const; valarray  stride   const;  };  }  The class gslice_array provides the following operations: namespace std {  template   class gslice_array {  Nicolai M. Josuttis: The C++ Standard Library, 2nd Edition  The default constructor creates an empty subset. With the start  , size  , and stride   member functions, you can query the properties of a gslice.   S.2 Valarrays  1145  public:  typedef T value_type;  void operator=  const T& ; void operator=  const valarray &  const; void operator*=  const valarray &  const; void operator =  const valarray &  const; void operator%=  const valarray &  const; void operator+=  const valarray &  const; void operator-=  const valarray &  const; void operator^=  const valarray &  const; void operator&=  const valarray &  const; void operator=  const valarray &  const; void operator &  const; void operator>>= const valarray &  const; ~gslice_array  ;  private:  gslice_array  ; gslice_array const gslice_array & ; gslice_array& operator= const gslice_array & ; ...  As with slice_array , note that class gslice_array  is intended purely as an internal helper class for gslices and should be transparent to the user. Thus, all constructors and the assignment operator of class gslice_array  are private.  };  }  Class mask_array  Objects of class mask_array are created by using a valarray  as the index of a nonconstant valarray:  namespace std {  template   class valarray {  public:  ... mask_array  operator[] const valarray & ; ...  };  }  The class mask_array provides the following operations:  namespace std {  Nicolai M. Josuttis: The C++ Standard Library, 2nd Edition   1146  Supplementary Chapter  template   class mask_array {  public:  typedef T value_type;  void operator=  const T& ; void operator=  const valarray &  const; void operator*=  const valarray &  const; void operator =  const valarray &  const; void operator%=  const valarray &  const; void operator+=  const valarray &  const; void operator-=  const valarray &  const; void operator^=  const valarray &  const; void operator&=  const valarray &  const; void operator=  const valarray &  const; void operator &  const; void operator>>= const valarray &  const; ~mask_array  ;  private:  mask_array  ; mask_array const mask_array & ; mask_array& operator= const mask_array & ; ...  Again, note that class mask_array  is intended purely as an internal helper class and should be transparent to the user. Thus, all constructors and the assignment operator of class mask_array  are private.  Objects of class indirect_array are created by using a valarray  as the index of a nonconstant valarray:  };  }  };  }  Class indirect_array  namespace std {  template   class valarray {  public:  ... indirect_array  operator[] const valarray & ; ...  The class indirect_array provides the following operations:  Nicolai M. Josuttis: The C++ Standard Library, 2nd Edition   S.2 Valarrays  1147  namespace std {  template   class indirect_array {  public:  typedef T value_type;  void operator=  const T& ; void operator=  const valarray &  const; void operator*=  const valarray &  const; void operator =  const valarray &  const; void operator%=  const valarray &  const; void operator+=  const valarray &  const; void operator-=  const valarray &  const; void operator^=  const valarray &  const; void operator&=  const valarray &  const; void operator=  const valarray &  const; void operator &  const; void operator>>= const valarray &  const; ~indirect_array  ;  private:  indirect_array  ; indirect_array const indirect_array & ; indirect_array& operator= const indirect_array & ; ...  };  }  As usual, class indirect_array  is intended purely as an internal helper class and should be transparent to the user. Thus, all constructors and the assignment operator of indirect_array  are private.  Nicolai M. Josuttis: The C++ Standard Library, 2nd Edition   1148  Supplementary Chapter  S.3 Allocators and Memory Functions in Detail  As introduced in Section 4.6, page 57, and Chapter 19, allocators represent a special memory model and are an abstraction used to translate the need to use memory into a raw call for memory. This section describes the details of using allocators and memory management, including:   Scoped allocators   The allocator interface and the default allocator   Providing an allocator before C++11   Utilities for uninitialized memory  S.3.1 Scoped Allocators  With C++98, the concept of allocators had a couple of constraints:   Container objects were not required to hold their allocator as members. Allocators were only a  part of the type. For this reason: – Allocators having the same type were assumed to be equal so that memory allocated by one  allocator could be deallocated by another allocator of the same type.  – It was not possible to change the memory resource at runtime. – Allocators had limitations in the ability to hold a state, such as bookkeeping information or  information about where to allocate next.  – Allocators were not swapped when the containers were swapped.    Allocators were not handled consistently, because copy constructors copied allocators, whereas the assignment operator did not. Thus, the copy constructor did not have the same effect as calling the default constructor and the assignment operator afterward.  For example:  std::list  list1;     equivalent to:    std::list > list1;  std::list > list2;  list1 == list2; list1 = list2;     ERROR: different types    ERROR: different types This even applied to strings, being a kind of STL container:  typedef std::basic_string ,  MyAlloc > MyString;  std::list  list3; std::list > list4; ... list4.push_back list3.front   ; std::equal_range list3.begin  ,list3.end  ,     ERROR: different element types  list4.begin  ,list4.end   ;    ERROR: different element types  Nicolai M. Josuttis: The C++ Standard Library, 2nd Edition   S.3 Allocators and Memory Functions in Detail  1149  A couple of proposed changes to C++11 are intended to solve all these issues. For example:   Library components are no longer allowed to assume that all allocators of a speciﬁc type compare   Allocator traits solve some of the problems created by stateful allocators.   A scoped allocator adapter provides the ability used to propagate the allocator from the container  equal.  to the contained elements.  These enhancements provide the tools to build a polymorphic allocator, which allows to compare or assign two containers with different allocator types that are derived from a common allocator type the container uses. However, due to time constraints, a standard polymorphic allocator is not part of C++11.4  Thus, the purpose of class scoped_allocator_adaptor is to allow propagating the allocator from the container to the contained elements. Note, however, that to provide backward compatibility, C++11 still provides the old allocator model by default. Internally, some allocator and allocator traits members allow switching to the new model, which class scoped_allocator_adaptor  uses to provide a convenient interface for this feature.  To consistently use an allocator for both the container and it elements you can program the  following:  include       use standard allocator for container and all elements: std::list >> list1;     use allocator MyAlloc  for container and all elements: std::list >> list2;  You can use an alias templates  see Section 3.1.9, page 27  instead. For example:  include    template   using MyList = std::list >>;  MyList >, list2;  To use a different allocator for the elements and for the container, you have to pass the element allocator as an additional template argument. For example:  std::list ,  MyAlloc2 >> list;  In the same way you can pass even more allocator types to specify the allocator of the element of the elements and so on.  4 Thanks to Pablo Halpern for providing the details for this paragraph.  Nicolai M. Josuttis: The C++ Standard Library, 2nd Edition   1150  Supplementary Chapter  S.3.2 A User-Deﬁned Allocator for C++98  As introduced in Section 19.2, page 1024, it is pretty easy to use your own allocator by providing the following:   A type deﬁnition of the value_type, which is simply the passed template parameter type.   A template constructor, which copies the internal state while changing the type.   A member allocate  , which provides new memory.   A member deallocate  , which releases memory that is no longer needed.   Constructors and a destructor, if necessary, to initialize, copy, and clean up the internal state.   Operators == and !=. However, before C++11, a lot of default values for user-deﬁned allocators were not provided. As a result, you had to provide additional members, which were more or less trivial. In correspon- dence to the allocator provided at Section 19.2, page 1024, let’s look at an allocator that fulﬁlls the requirements for a C++98 allocator:     alloc myalloc03.hpp  include   include   include    template   class MyAlloc {  public:  size_type;     type deﬁnitions typedef std::size_t typedef std::ptrdiff_t difference_type; typedef T* typedef const T* typedef T& typedef const T& typedef T  pointer; const_pointer; reference; const_reference; value_type;     constructors and destructor    - nothing to do because the allocator has no state MyAlloc   throw   { } MyAlloc const MyAlloc&  throw   { } template    MyAlloc  const MyAlloc &  throw   {  } ~MyAlloc   throw   { }  Nicolai M. Josuttis: The C++ Standard Library, 2nd Edition   S.3 Allocators and Memory Functions in Detail  1151     allocate but don’t initialize num elements of type T T* allocate  std::size_t num, const void* hint = 0  {     allocate memory with global new return static_cast  ::operator new num*sizeof T   ;  }  }  }  }  }  }     deallocate storage p of deleted elements void deallocate  T* p, std::size_t num  {     deallocate memory with global delete ::operator delete p ;     return address of values T* address  T& value  const {  return &value;  } const T* address  const T& value  const {  return &value;     return maximum number of elements that can be allocated std::size_t max_size    const throw   {     for numeric_limits see Section 5.3, page 115 return std::numeric_limits ::max     sizeof T ;     initialize elements of allocated storage p with value value void construct  T* p, const T& value  {     initialize memory with placement new ::new  void* p T value ;     destroy elements of initialized storage p void destroy  T* p  {     destroy objects by calling their destructor p->~T  ;     rebind allocator to type U template   struct rebind {  typedef MyAlloc  other;  };  };  Nicolai M. Josuttis: The C++ Standard Library, 2nd Edition   1152  Supplementary Chapter     return that all specializations of this allocator are interchangeable template   bool operator==  const MyAlloc &,  const MyAlloc &  throw   {  return true;  } template   bool operator!=  const MyAlloc &,  const MyAlloc &  throw   {  return false;  }  As you can see, you also have to provide a couple of additional types, address   members, max_size  , construct  , destroy  , and the rebind structure. The details of these members are described in Section S.3.4, page 1155.  The rebind  Member Template  Part of the allocator structure is a member template called rebind . This template structure pro- vides the ability for any allocator to allocate storage of another type indirectly. For example, if Allocator is an allocator type, then  Allocator::rebind ::other  is the type of the same allocator specialized for elements of type T2.  You can use rebind  if you implement a container and have to allocate memory for a type that differs from the element’s type. For example, to implement a deque, you typically need memory for arrays that manage blocks of elements  see the typical implementation of a deque in Section 7.4, page 283 . Thus, you need an allocator to allocate arrays of pointers to elements:  namespace std {  template <typename T,  class deque {  ...  private:  typename Allocator = allocator  >     rebind allocator for type T* typedef typename allocator_traits ::rebind_alloc  PtrAllocator;  alloc;  Allocator PtrAllocator block_alloc; T** ...  elems;     allocator for values of type T    allocator for values of type T*    array of blocks of elements  };  }  Nicolai M. Josuttis: The C++ Standard Library, 2nd Edition   S.3 Allocators and Memory Functions in Detail  1153  To manage the elements of a deque, you must have one allocator to handle arrays blocks of elements and another allocator to handle the array of element blocks. The latter has type PtrAllocator, which is the same allocator as for the elements. By using rebind , the allocator for the elements  Allocator  is bound to the type of an array of elements  T* . Before C++11, PtrAllocator would be deﬁned as follows:  typedef typename Allocator:: template rebind ::other  PtrAllocator;  S.3.3 The Default Allocator  The default allocator, which is used if no speciﬁc allocator is passed, is declared as follows:5  namespace std {  template   class allocator {  public:  size_type;     type deﬁnitions typedef size_t typedef ptrdiff_t difference_type; typedef T* typedef const T* typedef T& typedef const T& typedef T  pointer; const_pointer; reference; const_reference; value_type;     rebind allocator to type U template   struct rebind {  typedef allocator  other;  };     return address of values pointer const_pointer address const_reference value  const noexcept;  address reference value  const noexcept;     constructors and destructor allocator   noexcept; allocator const allocator&  noexcept;  5 Before C++11, construct   and destroy   were not member templates, and construct   had a value of type const T& as second argument.  Nicolai M. Josuttis: The C++ Standard Library, 2nd Edition   1154  Supplementary Chapter  template    allocator const allocator &  noexcept;  ~allocator  ;     return maximum number of elements that can be allocated size_type max_size   const noexcept;     allocate but don’t initialize num elements of type T pointer allocate size_type num,  allocator ::const_pointer hint = 0 ;     initialize elements of allocated storage p with values args template   void construct U* p, Args&&... args ;     delete elements of initialized storage p template   void destroy U* p ;     deallocate storage p of deleted elements void deallocate pointer p, size_type num ;  };  }  The default allocator uses the global operators new and delete to allocate and deallocate memory. Thus, allocate   may throw a bad_alloc exception. However, the default allocator may be optimized by reusing deallocated memory or by allocating more memory than needed to save time in additional allocations. So, the exact moments when operators new and delete are called are unspeciﬁed. See Section 19.2, page 1024, for a possible implementation of the default allocator.  The default allocator has the following specialization for type void: namespace std { template   class allocator  {  public:  pointer;  typedef void* typedef const void* const_pointer; typedef void template   struct rebind {  value_type;  typedef allocator  other;  };  };  }  Nicolai M. Josuttis: The C++ Standard Library, 2nd Edition   S.3 Allocators and Memory Functions in Detail  1155  S.3.4 Allocators in Detail  According to the speciﬁed requirements, allocators have to provide the following types and opera- tions. Allocators that are not provided for the standard containers may have fewer requirements.  Type Deﬁnitions  allocator::value_type   The type of the elements.   It is usually equivalent to T for an allocator . allocator::size_type   The type for unsigned integral values that can represent the size of the largest object in the   Default: std::make_unsigned ::type, which is usually  allocation model.  equivalent to std::size_t.  allocator::difference_type   The type for signed integral values that can represent the difference between any two pointers in   Default: std::pointer_traits ::difference_type, which is  the allocation model.  usually equivalent to std::ptrdiff_t.  allocator::pointer   The type of a pointer to the element type.

Josuttis: The C++ Standard Library, 2nd Edition   1156  Supplementary Chapter  allocator::reference   The type of a reference to the element type.   It is usually equivalent to T& for an allocator .   No longer required for allocators since C++11. allocator::const_reference   The type of a constant reference to the element type.   It is usually equivalent to const T& for an allocator .   No longer required for allocators since C++11. allocator::rebind   A template structure that provides the ability for any allocator to allocate storage of another type   It has to be declared as follows  which is the default since C++11 :  indirectly.  template   class allocator {  public:  template   struct rebind {  typedef allocator  other;  }; ...  }    See Section S.3.2, page 1152, for an explanation of the purpose of rebind . allocator::propagate_on_container_copy_assignment   Type trait to signal whether an allocator should be copied when the container is copy assigned.   Default: false_type.   Provided since C++11. allocator::propagate_on_container_move_assignment   Type trait to signal whether an allocator should be moved when the container is move assigned.   Default: false_type.   Provided since C++11. allocator::propagate_on_container_swap   Type trait to signal whether an allocator should be swapped when the container is swapped.   Default: false_type.   Provided since C++11.  Nicolai M.

No longer required since C++11  however, at least one non-copy non-converting constructor  must exist .  allocator::allocator  const allocator& a    The copy constructor.   Copies an allocator object so that storage allocated from the original and from the copy can be  deallocated via the other.  allocator::allocator  allocator&& a    The move constructor.   If it is not provided, the copy constructor is used.   Moves an allocator object so that storage allocated from a can be deallocated via *this.   Provided since C++11.  allocator::˜allocator      The destructor.   Destroys an allocator object.  pointer allocator::address  reference value  const_pointer allocator::address  const_reference value    The ﬁrst form returns a nonconstant pointer to the nonconstant value.   The second form returns a constant pointer to the constant value.

Josuttis: The C++ Standard Library, 2nd Edition   1158  Supplementary Chapter  void allocator::deallocate  pointer p, size_type num    Frees the storage to which p refers.   The storage of p has to be allocated by allocate   of the same or an equal allocator.   The elements must have been destroyed already.  void allocator::construct  U* p, Args&&...   Initializes the storage of one element to which p refers with args.   Default: ::new  void* p  U std::forward  args ... .   Before C++11, the second argument was a const T&.  args   void allocator::destroy  U* p    Destroys the object to which p refers without deallocating the storage.   Calls the destructor for the object.   Default: p->~U  .  bool operator ==  const allocator& a1, const allocator& a2    Returns true if allocators a1 and a2 are interchangeable.   Two allocators are interchangeable if storage allocated from each can be deallocated via the other.   Before C++11, to be usable by the standard containers, allocators of the same type were required  to be interchangeable, so that this function always had to return true.  bool operator !=  const allocator& a1, const allocator& a2    Returns true if two allocators are not interchangeable.   It is equivalent to ! a1 == a2 .   Before C++11, to be usable by the standard containers, allocators of the same type were required  to be interchangeable, so that this function always had to return false.  allocator select_on_container_copy_construction      Returns the allocator to be used to copy the allocator on container copy construction.
