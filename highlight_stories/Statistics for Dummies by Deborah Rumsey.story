Statistics For Dummies by Deborah Rumsey  John Wiley & Sons   2003  356 pages  This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life.  Definition of sample size n : When I refer to the size of a sample, I usually mean the number of individuals selected to participate in a survey, study, or experiment.  The notation for sample size is n.  Suppose, however, that 100 people were selected to participate in a survey, and only 80 of them responded: Which of these two numbers is n: 100 or 80? The convention I use is 80, the number of people who actually responded, and this number may be fewer than the number asked to participate. So, any time you see the phrase "sample size", think of it as the final number of individuals who participated in and provided information for the study.  Dual-use of the word "statistics": In some situations, I refer to statistics as a subject of study, or as a field of research, so the word is a singular noun. For example, "Statistics is really quite an interesting subject." In other situations, I refer to statistics as the plural of statistic, in a numerical sense. For example, "The most common statistics are the mean and the standard deviation."

Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence  Use of the word "data": You're probably unaware of the debate raging amongst statisticians about whether the word "data" should be singular  "data is …"  or plural  "data are …" . It got so bad that one group of statisticians had to develop two different versions of a statistics T-shirt recently: "Messy Data Happens" and "Messy Data Happen." At the risk of offending some of my colleagues, I'm going to go with the plural version of the word data in this book, because the word "data" is and will always be a plural noun  at least that's what my editor tells me .

Chapter 1: The Statistics of Everyday Life Today's society is completely taken over by numbers. Numbers appear everywhere you look, from billboards telling of the latest abortion statistics, to sports shows discussing the Las Vegas odds for the upcoming football game to the evening news, with stories focusing on crime rates, the expected life span of someone who eats junk food, and the president's approval rating. On a normal day, you can run into five, ten, or even twenty different statistics  with even more on Election Night . Just by reading   a Sunday newspaper all the way through, you come across literally hundreds of statistics in reports, Table of Contents advertisements, and articles covering everything from soup  how much does an average person Statistics for Dummies consume per year?  to nuts  how many nuts do you have to eat to increase your IQ? . Introduction Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics The purpose of this chapter is to show you how often statistics appear in your life and work and how Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life statistics are presented to the general public. After reading this chapter, you begin to see just how Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong often the media hits you with numbers and how important it is to be able to unravel what all those Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade numbers mean. Because, like it or not, statistics are a big part of your life. So, if you can't beat 'em, Part II - Number-Crunching Basics and you don't want to join 'em, you should at least try to understand 'em.

Readers are inundated with results of studies, Part IV - Wading through the Results announcements of breakthroughs, statistical reports, forecasts, projections, charts, graphs, and Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing summaries. The extent to which statistics occur in the media is mind-boggling. You may not even be Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! aware of how many times you're hit with numbers in today's information age. Here are just a few Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error examples from one Sunday paper's worth of news. While you're reading this, you may find yourself Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence getting nervous, wondering what you can and can't believe anymore. Relax! That's what this book is Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence for, helping you sort out the good from the bad information.  Chapters 2 through 5 give you a great start.  Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples Probing popcorn problems Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions The first article I come across that deals with numbers is entitled, "Popcorn plant faces health probe." Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples The subheading reads "Sick workers say flavoring chemicals caused lung problems." The article Part VII - Statistical Studies—The Inside Scoop describes how the Centers for Disease Control  CDC  is expressing concern about a possible link Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls between exposure to chemicals in microwave popcorn flavorings and some cases of fixed obstructive Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? lung disease. Eight people from one popcorn plant alone contracted this lung disease, and four of Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations them were awaiting lung transplants. According to the article, similar cases were reported at other Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control popcorn factories. Now, you may be asking, "What about the folks who eat microwave popcorn?" According to the article, the CDC finds "no reason to believe that people who eat microwave popcorn Part VIII - The Part of Tens have anything to fear."  Stay tuned.  They say that their next step is to evaluate employees more in- Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey depth, including surveys to determine health and possible exposures to the said chemicals, checks of Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes lung capacity, and detailed air samples. The question here is: How many cases of this lung disease Sources constitute a real pattern, compared to mere chance or a statistical anomaly?  More about this in Index Chapter 14.  List of Figures List of Tables Venturing into viruses List of Sidebars The second article I find discusses the most recent cyber attack — a worm-like virus that has made its way through the Internet, slowing down Web browsing and e-mail delivery across the world. How many computers were affected? The experts quoted in the article say that 39,000 computers were infected, affecting hundreds of thousands of other systems. How did they get that number? Wouldn't that be a hard number to get hold of? Did they check each computer out there to see whether it was affected? The fact that this article was written less than 24 hours after the attack would suggest that this number is a guess. Then why say 39,000 and not 40,000? To find out more on how to guesstimate with confidence  and how to evaluate someone else's numbers  see Chapter 11.  Intervals  Comprehending crashes   Next in the paper appears an alert about the soaring number of motorcycle fatalities. Experts say that these fatalities are up more than 50% since 1997, and no one can figure out why. The statistics tell an interesting story. In 1997, 2,116 motorcyclists were killed; in 2001, the number was 3,181, as reported by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  NHTSA . In the article, many possible causes for the increased motorcycle death rate are discussed, including the fact that riders today tend to be older  the average age of motorcyclists killed in crashes increased from 29.3 years in 1990 to 36.3 years in 2001 .  Statistics For Dummies by Deborah Rumsey  John Wiley & Sons   2003  356 pages  This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life.  ISBN:0764554239  Bigger bikes are listed as another possibility. The engine size of an average motorcycle has increased   almost 25% — from 769 cubic centimeters in 1990 to 959 cubic centimeters in 2001. Another Table of Contents possibility may be that some states are weakening their helmet laws. The experts quoted in the article Statistics for Dummies say that a more comprehensive causation study is needed, but such a study probably won't be done Introduction because it would cost between 2 and 3 million dollars. One issue that is not addressed in the article is Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics the number of people riding motorcycles in 2001, compared to the number of riders in1997. More Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life people on the roads generally means more fatalities, if all the other factors remain the same. Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong However, along with the article is a graph showing motorcycle deaths per 100 million vehicle miles Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade traveled in the United States from 1997 to 2001; does that address the issue of more people on the Part II - Number-Crunching Basics roads? A bar graph is also included, comparing motorcycle deaths to deaths that occurred in other Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs types of vehicles. This bar graphs shows that motorcycle deaths occur at a rate of 34.4 deaths per 100 Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More million vehicle miles traveled, compared to just 1.7 deaths for the same number of miles traveled in Part III - Determining the Odds cars. This article has lots of numbers and statistics, but what does it all mean? The number and types Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability of statistics can quickly get confusing. Chapter 4 helps you sort out graphs and charts and the statistics Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win that go along with them. Part IV - Wading through the Results Mulling malpractice Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error Further along in the newspaper is a report about a recent medical malpractice insurance study, which Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence may affect you in terms of the fees your doctor charges and your ability to get the health care you Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence need. So what's the extent of the problem? The article indicates that 1 in 5 Georgia doctors has stopped doing risky procedures  like delivering babies  because of the ever-increasing malpractice Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals insurance rates in the state. This is described as a "national epidemic" and a "health crisis" around the Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples country. Some brief details of the study are included, and the article states that of the 2,200 Georgia Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test doctors surveyed, 2,800 of them — which they say represents about 18% of those sampled — were Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions expected to stop providing high risk procedures. Wait a minute! Can that be right? Out of 2,200 Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples doctors, 2,800 don't perform the procedures, and that is supposed to represent 18%? That's impossible! You can't have a bigger number on the top of a fraction, and still have the fraction be Part VII - Statistical Studies—The Inside Scoop under 100%, right? This is one of many examples of errors in statistics that are reported in the media. Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls So what's the real percentage? You can only guess. Chapter 5 nails down the particulars of calculating Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? statistics, so that you can know what to look for and immediately tell when something's not right. Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control Belaboring the loss of land Part VIII - The Part of Tens Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey In the same Sunday paper is an article about the extent of land development and speculation across Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes the country. Given the number of homes likely being built in your neck of the woods, this is an Sources important issue to get a handle on. Statistics are given regarding the number of acres of farmland that Index are being lost to development each year and also translates those acres to square miles. To further List of Figures illustrate how much land is being lost, the area is also listed in terms of the number of football fields. In List of Tables this particular example, experts say that the mid-Ohio area is losing 150,000 acres per year, which is List of Sidebars 234 square miles, or 115,385 football fields  including end zones . How do people come up with these numbers, and how accurate are they? And does it help to visualize land loss in terms of the corresponding number of football fields?  Intervals  Scrutinizing schools The next topic in the paper is school proficiency, specifically whether extra school sessions are helping students perform better. The article states that 81.3% of students in this particular district who attended extra sessions passed the writing proficiency test, while only 71.7% of those who didn't participate in the extra school sessions passed the proficiency test. But is this enough of a difference to account for the $386,000 price tag per year? And what's happening in these sessions to account for an   improvement? Are students in these sessions spending more time just preparing for those exams, rather than learning more about writing in general? And here's the big question: Were those who participated in these extra sessions student volunteers who may be more motivated than the average student to try to improve their test scores? No one knows. Studies like this are going on all the time, and the only way to know what to believe is to understand what questions to ask, and to be able to critique the quality of the study. That's all part of statistics! The good news is, with a few clarifying questions, you can quickly critique statistical studies and their results. Chapter 17 helps you to do just that.

Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence  Surveys and polls are probably the biggest vehicle used by today's media to grab your attention. It seems that everyone wants to do a survey, including market managers, insurance companies, TV stations, community groups, and even students in high-school classes. Here are just a few examples of survey results that are part of today's news.  With the aging of the American work force, companies are planning for their future leadership.  How do they know that the American workforce is aging, and if it is, by how much is it aging?  A recent survey shows that nearly 67% of human resources managers polled said that planning for succession had become more important in the past five years than it had been in the past. Now if you're thinking you want to quit your day job and apply to be a CEO, hold on. The survey also says that 88% of the 210 respondents said they usually or often fill senior positions with internal candidates.  But how many managers did not respond, and is 210 respondents really enough people to warrant a story on the front page of the business section?  Believe it or not, when you start looking for them, you find numerous examples in the news of surveys based on far fewer participants than this.

Besides the scores of the last game, the win lose percentages for each team in the league, and the relative standing for each team, the specialized statistics reported in the sports world are so thick that they require wading boots to get through. For example, the basketball statistics are broken down by team, by quarter, and even by player. And you need to be a basketball junkie to interpret all of this, because everything is abbreviated  with no legend provided if you're out of the loop :  Some surveys are based on lighter fare. For example, which device do Americans find most crucial today, their toothbrushes, bread machines, computers, cars, or cellphones? In a survey of 1,042 adults and 400 teens  how did they decide on those numbers?  42% of adults and 34% of teens ranked the toothbrush as more important to them than cars, computers, or cellphones. Is this really big news? Since when should something as critical to daily hygiene as a toothbrush be lumped in with cellphones and bread machines?  The car came in second. But did you really need a survey to tell you that?  For more information on surveys, see Chapter 16.

Intervals  Talking sex  and statistics  with Dr. Ruth On the accent page of the Sunday paper, you can read about Dr. Ruth's latest research on people's sex lives. She reports that sex doesn't stop at age 60 or even age 70. That's nice to know, but how did she determine this, and to what extent are people having sex at these ages? She doesn't say  maybe some statistics are better left unsaid, huh? . However, Dr. Ruth does recommend that folks in this age group disregard the surveys that report how many times a week, month, or year a couple has sex. In   ISBN:0764554239  The Las Vegas odds  her view, this is just people bragging. She may be right about this. Think about it, if someone conducted a survey by calling people on the phone asking for a few minutes of their time to discuss their sex lives, who is going to be the most likely to want to talk about it? And what are they going to say in response to the question, "How many times a week do you have sex?" Are they going to report something that is the honest truth, or are they going to exaggerate a little? Self-reported surveys can be a real source of bias, and can lead to misleading statistics. So, don't be too hard on Dr. Ruth  who, by the way, is the author of Sex For Dummies, 2nd Edition, published by Wiley Publishing, Inc. . How would you recommend she go about finding out more about this very personal subject? Sometimes, research is more difficult than it seems.

Studies also show that the more dramatic a movie is, the more popcorn is sold. Yes, the entertainment business even keeps tabs on how much crunching you do at the movies. How do they collect all of this information, and how does it impact the types of movies that are made? This, too, is part of statistics: designing and carrying out studies to help pinpoint an audience and find out what they like, and then using the information to help guide the making of the product.

First, a simple, honest error could have taken place. This can happen to anyone, right?  Statistics For Dummies by Deborah Rumsey  John Wiley & Sons   2003  356 pages  This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life.  Other times, the error is a little more than a simple, honest mistake. In the heat of the moment, because someone feels strongly about a cause and because the numbers don't quite bear out the   point that the researcher wants to make, statistics get tweaked, or, more commonly, they get Table of Contents exaggerated, either in terms of their values or in the way they're represented and discussed. Statistics for Dummies Finally, you may encounter situations in which the numbers have been completely fabricated and Introduction could not be repeatable by anyone because the results never happened. This is the worst-case Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics scenario, and it does happen in the real world. Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong This section gives you tips to help you spot errors, exaggerations, and lies, along with some examples Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade of each type of error that you, as an information consumer, may encounter. Part II - Number-Crunching Basics Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs Checking the math Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More Part III - Determining the Odds The first thing you want to do when you come upon a statistic or the result of a statistical study is to ask Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability the question, "Is this number correct?" Don't assume that it is! You may be surprised at the number of Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win simple arithmetic errors that occur when statistics are collected, summarized, reported, or interpreted. Part IV - Wading through the Results Keep in mind that another type of error is an error of omission — information that is missing that would Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing have made a big difference in terms of getting a handle on the real story behind the numbers. That Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! makes the issue of correctness difficult to address, because you're lacking information to go on. Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence  Check to be sure everything adds up. In other words, do the percents in the pie chart add to 100? Do the number of people in each category add up to the total number surveyed?  Always look for a total, so that you can put the results into proper perspective. Ignore results based on tiny sample sizes.  Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples Part VII - Statistical Studies—The Inside Scoop Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls Microwaving just doesn't add up Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? Many statistics break results down into groups, showing the percentage of people in each group who Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations responded in a certain way regarding a particular question or demographic factor  such as age, Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control gender, and so on . That's an effective way to report statistics, as long as all the percentages add up to Part VIII - The Part of Tens 100%. Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes For example, USA Today reported the results of an opinion research study done for Tupperware Sources regarding microwaving leftovers. The story reported that 28% of the people surveyed said they Index microwave leftovers almost daily, 43% said they microwave leftovers two to four times a week, and List of Figures 15% said they do it once a week. Assuming that everyone should fit into these results somewhere, the List of Tables percentages should add up to 100, or close to it. Quickly checking, the total is 28% + 43% + 15% = List of Sidebars 86%. What happened to the other 14%? Who was left out? Where do they fall in the mix? No one knows. The statistics just aren't adding up. Four out of five — really? Another item you can check quickly is whether the total number of respondents is given. As a quick example, you may remember the Trident gum commercials which said that "Four out of five dentists surveyed recommend Trident gum for their patients who chew gum." This commercial is quite a few years old, but recently it has been revived in a funny series of new commercials asking, "What happened to that fifth dentist?" and then showing some incidents that might have happened to the fifth dentist that stopped him or her from pushing the "yes" button. But here is the real question: How many dentists were really surveyed? You don't know, because the survey doesn't tell you. You can't even  Double check even the most basic of calculations.   check the fine print, because in the case of this type of advertising, none is required.  ISBN:0764554239  Why would knowing the total number of respondents make a difference? Because the reliability of a statistic is, in part, due to the amount of information that went into the statistic  as long as it was good and correct information . When the advertisers say "four out of five dentists", there may have actually been only five dentists surveyed. Now, maybe 5,000 were surveyed, and in that case, 4,000 of them recommended the gum. The point is, you don't know how many dentists actually recommended the gum unless you do more detective work to find out. In most cases, the burden is on you, the consumer, to find that information. Unless you know the total number of people who took part in the study, you can't get any perspective on how reliable this information could be.

By far the most Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong common abuse of statistics is a subtle, yet effective, exaggeration of the truth.

Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error Crime statistics are a great example of how statistics are used to show two sides of a story, only one of which is really correct. Crime is often discussed in political debates, with one candidate  usually the Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence incumbent  arguing that crime has gone down during his or her tenure, and the challenger often Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence arguing that crime has gone up  giving the challenger something to criticize the incumbent for . How Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals can two political candidates talk about crime going in two different directions? Assuming that the math Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples is correct, how can this happen?

It appears to be moving down in general, but you could look at these data Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong in different ways and present these numbers in ways that make the trend look different. The big question is, do these data tell the whole story? Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade Part II - Number-Crunching Basics For example, compare 1987 to 1993. In 1987 an estimated 13,508,700 crimes took place in the United Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs States, and in 1993, the total number of crimes was 14,144,800. It looks like crime went up during Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More those six years. Imagine if you were a candidate making a challenge for the presidency; you could Part III - Determining the Odds build a platform around this apparent increase in crime. And if you fast-forward to 1996, the total Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability number of crimes in that year was estimated to be 13,493,900, which is only slightly less than the total Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win number of crimes in 1987. So, was very much done to help curb crime during the nine-year period Part IV - Wading through the Results from 1987 to 1993? In addition, these numbers don't tell the whole story. Is the total number of crimes Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing for a given year the most appropriate statistic to measure the extent of crime in the United States? Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error Another piece of important information has been left out of the story  and believe me, this happens more often than you may think ! Something else besides the number of crimes went up between 1987 Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence and 1993: the population of the United States. The total population of the country should also play a Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence role in the crime statistics, because when the number of people living in the country increases, you'd Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals also expect the number of potential criminals and potential crime victims to increase. So, to put crime Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples into perspective, you must account for the total number of people as well as the number of crimes. How is this done? The FBI reports a crime index, which is simply a crime rate. A rate is a ratio; it's the Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test number of people or events that you're interested in, divided by the total number in the entire group. Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples Part VII - Statistical Studies—The Inside Scoop Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control Part VIII - The Part of Tens Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes Sources Index List of Figures List of Tables List of Sidebars  A ratio is a fraction that divides two quantities. For example, "The ratio of girls to boys is 3 to 2" means that for every 3 girls, you find 2 boys. It doesn't mean that only 3 girls and 2 guys are in the group; ratios are expressed in lowest terms  simplified as small as possible . So you could have 300 girls and 200 guys; the ratio would still be 3 to 2.  Statistics have a variety of different units in which they are expressed, and this variety can be confusing.  A rate is a ratio that reflects some quantity per a certain unit. For example, your car goes 60 miles per hour, or a neighborhood burglary rate is 3 burglaries per 1,000 homes.  A percentage is a number between 0 and 100 that reflects a proportion of the whole. For example, a shirt is 10% off, or 35% of the population is in favor of a four-day work week. To convert from a percent to a decimal, divide by 100 or move the decimal over two places to the left. To remember this more easily, just remember that 100% is equal to 1, or 1.00, and to get from 100 to 1 you divide by 100 or move the decimal over 2 places to the left.  And just do the opposite to change from a decimal to a percent.   The lowdown on ratios, rates, and percents  Percentages can be used to determine how much a value increases or decreases, relatively speaking. Suppose the crimes in one city went up from 50 to 60, while the number of crimes in another city went up from 500 to 510. Both cities had an increase of 10 crimes, but for the first city, this difference is much larger, as a percentage of the total number of crimes. To find the percentage increase, take the "after" amount, minus the "before" amount and divide that result by the "before" amount. For the first city, this means crime went up by  60 – 50  ÷ 50 =   10 ÷ 50 = 0.20 or 20%. For the second city, this change reflects only a 2% increase, because  510 - 500  ÷ 500 = 10 ÷ 500 = 0.02 or 2%. To find percentage decrease, do the same steps. You'll just get a negative number, indicating a decrease.

Note that this represents a 4.7% increase, because 14,144,800 - 13,508,700 equals 636,100, and if you divide this number by the original value, 13,508,700, you get 0.047, which is 4.7%.  So, looking at it this way, someone may report that crime went up 4.7% from 1987 to 1993. But this 4.7% represents an increase in the total number of crimes, not the number of crimes per person, or the number of crimes per 100,000 people. To find out how the number of crimes per 100,000 people changed over time, you need to calculate and compare the crime rates for 1987 and 1993. Here's how:  5,484.4 – 5,550.0  ÷ 5,550.0 = –65.6 ÷ 5,550.0 = –0.012 = –1.2%.

And just to be clear, what's the difference between a chart and a graph? Not much: Statisticians use these terms quite interchangeably when talking about visual displays of statistical information. But a good rule is that if the picture shows bars or pies or other figures or shapes, you're looking at a chart. Otherwise, you are looking at a graph, which plots numbers as they change over time, or as they appear as pairs on the  x,y  plane.  More on that stuff in Chapter 18.

Notice that in   this chart, it seems that the number 1 doesn't get drawn nearly as often  only 468 times  as number 2 Table of Contents does  513 times . The difference in the height of these two bars appears to be very large, exaggerating Statistics for Dummies the difference in the number of times these two numbers were drawn. However, to put this in perspective, the actual difference here is 513 - 468 = 45, out of a total of 4,839 numbers drawn. In Introduction terms of the total number of individual numbers drawn, the difference between the number of times Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics the number 1 and the number 2 are drawn is 45 ÷ 4,839 = 0.009, or only nine-tenths of one percent.

This is a common trick used to exaggerate Part VII - Statistical Studies—The Inside Scoop results — stretching the scale so that differences appear larger than they really are. Second, the chart Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls starts counting not at zero, but at 465, so it really is only showing the top part of each bar, where the Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? differences are.

Now why would a lottery do this? Maybe it wants you to believe you're getting some inside information, and thinking that the number 1 doesn't get drawn very much will make you want to buy a lottery ticket and choose 1, because it's "due" to happen  which is not true, by the way; see Chapter 7 for more on this . Or, you may want to choose the number 2, because it has been drawn a lot, and it's "on a roll"  again, no dice . However you look at it, the lottery folks want you to think that some "magic" is involved in the numbers, and you can't blame them; that's their business.   HEADS UP   Misleading graphs occur all the time in the media! Reporters and others can stretch the scale out  make the tick marks represent increments of small amounts  and or start at a number other than zero, to make differences appear larger than they really are. Or the scale can also be squeezed down  make the tick marks represent increments of large amounts  to give the appearance of "no change." These are examples of misleading representations of the truth.  See Chapter 4 for more information on spotting misleading graphs.

Sample size isn't everything, but it does count for a great deal in terms of surveys and studies. If the Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error study is designed and conducted correctly, and if the participants are selected randomly  that is, with Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence no bias; see Chapter 3 for more on random samples , sample size is an important factor in Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence determining the accuracy and repeatability of the results.  See Chapters 16 and 17 for more information on designing and carrying out studies.  Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples You may think that all studies are based on large numbers of participants. This is true for most surveys, but it isn't always true for other types of research, such as studies involving carefully Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test controlled experiments. Experiments can be very time consuming; sometimes they take months or Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions years to conduct in a variety of situations. Experimental studies can also be costly. Some experiments Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples involve examining not people but products, such as computer chips or military equipment costing Part VII - Statistical Studies—The Inside Scoop thousands or even millions of dollars. If the experiment involves destroying the product in the process Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls of testing it, the cost of each experiment can be quite high. Because of the high cost of some types of Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? research, some studies are based on a small number of participants or products. But fewer Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations participants in a study  or fewer products tested  means less information overall, so studies with small Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control numbers of participants  or products  in general are less accurate than similar studies with larger Part VIII - The Part of Tens sample sizes. Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes Most researchers try to include the largest sample size they can afford, and they balance the cost of Sources the sample size with the need for accuracy. Sometimes, though, people are just lazy and don't want to Index bother with a large enough sample. Sometimes, those researchers don't really understand the List of Figures ramifications of having a small sample. And some folks hope you won't understand the importance of List of Tables sample size, but now you do. List of Sidebars HEADS UP   The worst examples of woefully inadequate sample size I've seen are TV ads where the sample size is only one. Usually, these commercials present what look like experiments to try to persuade the viewers that one product is superior to another. You've probably seen the TV commercial pitting one paper towel brand against another, where one piece of each type of paper towel is used to try to absorb the same amount of red juice. These examples may sound silly, but anyone can easily fall into the trap of drawing conclusions based on a sample size of one.  Have you ever told someone not to buy a product because you had a bad experience with it?  Remember that an anecdote  or story  is really a study with a sample size of only one.   REMEMBER Check the sample size to be sure the researchers have enough information on  ISBN:0764554239  which to base their results. The margin of error  see Chapter 10  also gives you an Statistics For Dummies idea of the sample size, because a small margin of error most likely means that a by Deborah Rumsey  large sample was used.

Your doctor's time: Quantity or quality? Headlines are the media's bread and butter, but headlines can also be misleading. Oftentimes, the headlines are more grandiose than the "real" information, especially when the stories involve statistics   and the studies that generated the statistics. In fact, you'll often see a real gap between a headline and Table of Contents the "fine print" in such media stories. Statistics for Dummies Introduction A study conducted a few years back evaluated videotaped sessions of 1,265 patient appointments with Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics 59 primary-care physicians and 6 surgeons in Colorado and Oregon. This study found that physicians Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life who had not been sued for malpractice spent an average of 18 minutes with each patient, compared Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong to 16 minutes for physicians who had been sued for malpractice. Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade Wow, is two minutes really that important? When the study was reported by the media with the Part II - Number-Crunching Basics headline, "Bedside manner fends off malpractice suits", this study seemed to say that if you are a Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs doctor who gets sued, all you have to do is spend more time with your patients, and you're off the Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More hook. Part III - Determining the Odds Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability What's really going on? Am I supposed to believe that a doctor who has been sued needs only add a Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win couple more minutes of time with each patient, and he can avoid being sued? Think about some of the Part IV - Wading through the Results other possibilities that may be involved here. It could be the case that doctors who don't get sued are Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing just better doctors, ask more questions, listen more, and tell their patients more of what to expect, Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! thereby taking more time; if so, what a doctor does during that time counts much more than how much Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error time the doctor actually spends with each patient. But what about this possibility: Maybe the doctors Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence who get sued are doing more difficult types of operations, or maybe they're specialists of some kind. Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence Unfortunately, the article doesn't give you this information. Another possibility is that the doctors who don't get sued have fewer patients and, therefore, are able to spend more time with each patient and Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals keep better track of them. At any rate, the fine print here doesn't quite match the hype, and when you Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples read or hear about stories like these, watch out for similar gaps between what the headline claims and Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test what the study actually found. Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions Reporting beyond the scope Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples Part VII - Statistical Studies—The Inside Scoop You may wonder how political candidates find out about how their constituents feel. They conduct polls Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls and surveys. Many surveys are done by an independent group, such as The Gallup Organization; Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? others are done by representatives of the candidates themselves, and their methods can differ greatly Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations from candidate to candidate, or from survey to survey. Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control Part VIII - The Part of Tens In the 1992 presidential election, Ross Perot made quite a splash on the political scene. His group, Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey United We Stand America, gained momentum and, ultimately, Ross Perot and his supporters made an Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes impact on the election results. Often during debates and campaign speeches, Perot would give Sources statistics and make conclusions about how Americans felt about certain issues. But was Mr. Perot Index always clear on how "Americans" felt, or was he simply clear about how his supporters felt? One of the List of Figures vehicles Ross Perot used to get a handle on the opinions of Americans was to publish a questionnaire List of Tables in the March 21, 1992, TV Guide, asking people to fill it out and send it to the address provided. Then he compiled the results of the survey and made them part of his campaign platform. From these List of Sidebars results, he concluded that over 80% of the American people agreed with him on these issues.  Note, however, that he received only 18.91% of the vote in 1992.   Intervals  Part of the trouble with Mr. Perot's claims is the way the survey was conducted. In order to respond, you had to purchase the TV Guide, you had to have strong enough feelings about the survey to fill it out, and you had to mail it in yourself with your own stamp. Who is most likely to do this? Those who have strong opinions. In addition, the wording of the questions in this survey probably encouraged the people who agreed with Ross Perot to fill out the survey and send it in; those who didn't agree with him were more likely to ignore the survey.   Tip If you can tell, based on the wording of the question, how the researcher wants you to respond to it, you know you're looking at a leading question.  See Chapter 16 for more information on how to spot this and other problems with surveys.   Here is a sampling of some questions Mr. Perot used in his questionnaire. I paraphrased them, but the original intent is intact.  And this is not to pick on Mr. Perot; many political candidates and their supporters do the same type of thing.

Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions But every once in a while, you hear about someone who faked his or her data, or "fudged the Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples numbers."

In cases Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls when someone has clearly made an error  for example, someone's age is recorded as being 200 Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? years  it makes sense to try to clean up the data by either removing that erroneous data point or by Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations trying to correct the error.

What about those who didn't complete the study, especially a medical one? Did they Sources die? Did they get tired of the side effects of the experimental drug and quit?

List of Tables List of Sidebars Not everyone responds to surveys, and even people who generally try to take part in surveys sometimes find that they don't have the time or interest to respond to every single survey that they're bombarded with. American society today is survey-crazy, and hardly a month goes by when you aren't asked to do a phone survey, an Internet survey, or a mail survey on topics ranging from your product preferences to your opinion on the new dog-barking ordinance for the neighborhood. Survey results are only reported for the people who actually responded, and the opinions of those who chose to respond may be very different from the opinions of those who chose not to respond. Whether the researchers make a point of telling you this, though, is another matter.  For example, someone can say that he or she sent out 5,000 surveys, received 1,000 surveys back, and based the results on those responses. You may then think, "Wow, 1,000 responses. That's a lot of data; that must be a pretty accurate survey." Wrong. The problem is, 4,000 people who were selected   to participate in the survey chose not to, and you have no idea what they would have said if they had responded. You have no guarantee that the opinions of these 4,000 people are represented by the folks who responded. In fact, the opposite could be true.  Tip What constitutes a high response rate  that is, the number of respondents divided by the  Statistics For Dummies by Deborah Rumsey  John Wiley & Sons   2003  356 pages  This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life.  number of surveys sent out ? Some statisticians would settle for nothing less than 70%, but as TV's Dr. Phil would say, statisticians need to "get real." Rarely does a survey achieve that high of a response rate. But in general, the lower the response rate, the less credible the results and the more the results will favor the opinions of those who responded.  And keep in mind that respondents tend to have stronger opinions about the issues they choose to respond to.

Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary!

List of Figures List of Tables List of Sidebars  This step is a challenge, because you can't go out and ask every person in the United States whether they plan to vote, and if so, for whom they plan to vote. Beyond that, suppose someone says, "Yes, I plan to vote." Will that person really vote come Election Day? And will that same person tell you for whom he or she actually plans to vote? And what if that person changes his or her mind later on and votes for a different candidate?  In this case, the researcher would use registered voters who plan to vote in the next election.  Determine the group of people to be studied.  Collect the data.  1.  3.  Organize, summarize, and analyze the data.  After the researcher has gone out and gotten the data that she needs, getting it organized, summarized, and analyzed helps the researcher answer her question. This is what most people recognize as the business of statistics.  4.  Take all the data summaries, the charts and graphs, and the analyses, and draw conclusions from them to try to answer the researcher's original question.   4.

But she can get an answer that she can be nearly 100% sure is the correct answer. In fact, with a sample of about 2,500 people who are selected in a fair and unbiased way  so that each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected , the researcher can get accurate results, within plus or minus 2.5%  that is, if all of the steps in the research process are done correctly .

In making conclusions, the researcher has to be aware that every study has limits, and that — because there is always a chance for error — the results could be wrong. A numerical value can be reported that tells others how confident the researcher is about the results, and how accurate these results are expected to be.  See Chapter 10 for more information on margin of error.   REMEMBER After the research is done and the question has been answered, the results typically lead to even more questions and even more research. For example, if men appear to favor Miss Calculation but women favor her opponent, the next questions could be, "Who goes to the polls more often on Election Day — men or women — and what factors determine whether they will vote?"

Grabbing Some Basic Statistical Jargon Every trade has a basic set of tools, and statistics is no different. If you think about the statistical process as a series of stages that one goes through to get from a question to an answer, you may guess that at each stage, you'll find a group of tools and a set of terms  or statistical jargon  to go along with it. Now if the hair is beginning to stand up on the back of your neck, don't worry. No one is asking you to become a statistics expert and plunge into the heavy-duty stuff, and no one is asking you   to become a statistics nerd and use this jargon all the time. And you don't have to carry a calculator Table of Contents and pocket protector in your front left pocket like statisticians do, either. Statistics for Dummies Introduction But as the world becomes more numbers-conscious, statistical terms are thrown around more in the Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics media and in the workplace, so knowing what the language really means can give you a leg up. Also, if Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life you're reading this book because you want to find out more about how to calculate some simple Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong statistics, understanding some of the basic jargon is your first step. So, in this section, you get a taste of statistical jargon; I send you to the appropriate chapters elsewhere in the book to get details. Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade Part II - Number-Crunching Basics Population Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More Part III - Determining the Odds For virtually any question that you may want to investigate about the world, you have to center your Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability attention on a particular group of individuals  for example, a particular group of people, cities, animals, rock specimens, exam scores, and so on . For example: Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win Part IV - Wading through the Results Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence  What percentage of the planted crops in Wisconsin were destroyed by deer last year?  What's the prognosis for breast cancer patients taking a new experimental drug?  What do Americans think about the president's foreign policy?  What percentage of all toothpaste tubes get filled according to their specifications?  Intervals  Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals In each of these examples, a question is posed. And in each case, you can identify a specific group of Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples individuals who are being studied: the American people, all planted crops in Wisconsin, all breast Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test cancer patients, and all toothpaste tubes that are being filled, respectively. The group of individuals Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions that you wish to study in order to answer your research question is called a population. Populations, Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples however, can be hard to define. In a good study, researchers define the population very clearly, while Part VII - Statistical Studies—The Inside Scoop in a bad study, the population is poorly defined. Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? The question about whether babies sleep better with music is a good example of how difficult defining the population can be. Exactly how would you define a baby? Under 3 months old? Under a year old? Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations And do you want to study babies only in the United States, or do you want to study all babies Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control worldwide?

Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes HEADS Sources UP  Index List of Figures List of Tables List of Sidebars  Many times, researchers want to study and make conclusions about a broad population, but in the end, in order to save time, money, or just because they don't know any better, they study only a narrowly defined population. That can lead to big trouble when conclusions are drawn. For example, suppose a college professor wants to study how TV ads persuade consumers to buy products. Her study is based on a group of her own students who participated in order to get five points extra credit  you know you're one of them! . This may be a convenient sample, but her results can't be generalized to any population beyond her own students, because no other population was represented in her study.  Sample When you sample some soup, what do you do? You stir the pot, reach in with a spoon, take out a little bit of the soup, and taste it. Then you draw a conclusion about the whole pot of soup, without actually having tasted all of it. If your sample is taken in a fair way  for example, you didn't just grab all the good stuff  you will get a good idea how the soup tastes without having to eat it all. This is what's done in statistics. Researchers want to find out something about a population, but they don't have time or   ISBN:0764554239  money to study every single individual in the population. So what do they do? They select a small number of individuals from the population, study those individuals, and use that information to draw conclusions about the whole population. This is called a sample.  REMEMBER The next time you're hit with the results of a study, find out the makeup of the sample  Statistics For Dummies by Deborah Rumsey  John Wiley & Sons   2003  356 pages  This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life.  of participants and ask yourself whether this sample represents the intended population. Be wary of any conclusions being made about a broader population than what was actually studied.  More in Chapter 16.   One of the biggest culprits of statistical misrepresentation caused by bad sampling is surveys done on the Internet. You can find thousands of examples of surveys on the Internet that are done by having people log on to a particular Web site and give their opinions. Even if 50,000 people in the United States complete a survey on the Internet, it doesn't represent the population of all Americans. It represents only those folks who have Internet access, who logged on to that particular Web site, and who were interested enough to participate in the survey  which typically means that they have strong opinions about the topic in question .  Sounds nice and neat, right? Unfortunately it's not. Notice that I said select a sample. That sounds like a simple process, but in fact, it isn't. The way a sample is selected from the population can mean the difference between results that are correct and fair and results that are garbage. As an example, suppose you want to get a sample of teenagers' opinions on whether they're spending too much time on the Internet. If you send out a survey over e-mail, your results won't represent the opinions of all teenagers, which is your intended population. They will represent only those teenagers who have   Table of Contents Internet access. Does this sort of statistical mismatch happen often? You bet.

In the way the sample is selected: For example, if you want to get an estimate of how much Christmas shopping people in your community plan to do this year, and you take your clipboard and head out to the mall on the day after Thanksgiving to ask customers about their shopping plans, you have bias in your sampling process. Your sample tends to favor those die-hard shoppers at that particular mall who were braving the massive crowds that day.  in, find out what questions were asked and exactly how the questions were worded before drawing your conclusions about the results.  In the way data are collected: Poll questions are a major source of bias. Because researchers are often looking for a particular result, the questions they ask can often reflect that expected result. For example, the issue of a tax levy to help support local schools is something every voter faces at one time or another. A poll question asking, "Don't you think it would be a great investment in our future to support the local schools?" does have a bit of bias. On the other hand, so does the question, "Aren't you tired of paying money out of your pocket to educate other people's children besides your own?" Question wording can have a huge impact on the results. See Chapter 16 for more on designing polls and surveys.

While these characteristics can take on numerical values  such as a "1" indicating male and "2" indicating female , those numbers don't have any specific meaning. You couldn't add them together, for example.  Note that statisticians also call this qualitative data.   Numerical data are data that have meaning as a measurement, such as a person's height, weight, IQ, or blood pressure; the number of stocks a person owns; the number of teeth a person's dog has; or anything else that can be counted.  Statisticians also refer to numerical data as quantitative data or measurement data.   Not all data are created equal. Finding out how the data were collected can go a long way toward determining how you weigh the results and what conclusions you draw from them.  Intervals  Statistic A statistic is a number that summarizes the data collected from a sample. People use many different statistics to summarize data. For example, data can be summarized as a percentage  60% of the households sampled from the United States own more than two cars , an average  the average price of a home in this sample is … , a median  the median salary for the 1,000 computer scientists in this sample was … , or a percentile  your baby's weight is at the 90th percentile this month, based on data   collected from over 10,000 babies … .

Most of the time, researchers are trying to estimate the parameters using statistics. In the case of the U.S. Census Bureau, that agency wants to report the total number of people in the United States, so it conducts a census. However, due to logistical problems in doing such an arduous task  such as being able to contact homeless folks , the census numbers can only be called estimates in the end, and they're adjusted upward to account for those people that the census missed. The long form for the census is filled out by a random sample of households; the U.S. Census Bureau uses this information to draw conclusions about the entire population  without asking every person to fill out the long form .

But exactly what is a standard List of Figures deviation? List of Tables List of Sidebars The standard deviation is a way statisticians use to measure the amount of variability  or spread  among the numbers in a data set. As the term implies, a standard deviation is a standard  or typical  amount of deviation  or distance  from the average  or mean, as statisticians like to call it . So, the standard deviation, in very rough terms, is the average distance from the mean. See Chapter 5 for calculations and more information.  reported. If not, ask for it! The average and the median are two different representations of the middle of a data set and can often give two very different stories about the data.  REMEMBER The next time you hear an average reported, look to see whether the median is also  Intervals  The standard deviation is also used to describe where most of the data should fall, in a relative sense, compared to the average. For example, in many cases, about 95% of the data will lie within two standard deviations of the mean.  This result is called the empirical rule. See Chapter 8 for more on this.    TECHNICAL STUFF  The formula for standard deviation s  is as follows:  Statistics For Dummies by Deborah Rumsey  John Wiley & Sons   2003  356 pages  This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life.  n = the number of values in the data set  x = the average of all the values  ISBN:0764554239   where  x = each value in the data set  Intervals  REMEMBER Don't be satisfied with finding out only the average — be sure to ask for the standard  deviation, as well. Without a standard deviation, you have no way of knowing how spread out the values may be.  If you're talking starting salaries, for example, this could be very important!   The standard deviation is an important statistic, but it is often absent when statistical results are reported. Without it, you're getting only part of the story about the data. Statisticians like to tell the story about the man who had one foot in a bucket of ice water and the other foot in a bucket of boiling water. He said that, on average, he felt just great! But think about the variability in the two temperatures for each of his feet. Closer to home, the average house price, for example, tells you nothing about the range of house prices you may encounter when house-hunting. The average salary may not fully represent what's really going on in your company, if the salaries are extremely spread out.

Normal distribution  or bell-shaped curve  When numerical data are organized, they're often ordered from smallest to largest, broken into reasonably sized groups, then put into graphs and charts to examine the shape, or distribution, of the data. The most common type of data distribution is called the bell-shaped curve, in which most of the   data are centered around the average in a big lump, and as you move farther out on either side of the Table of Contents mean, you find fewer and fewer data points. Figure 3-1 shows a picture of a bell-shaped curve; notice Statistics for Dummies that the shape of the curve resembles the outline of an old-fashioned bell.

For example, if the data have a normal distribution, you can expect most of the data to lie within two standard deviations of the mean. Because every distinct population of Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals data has a different mean and standard deviation, an infinite number of different normal distributions Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples exist, each with its own mean and its own standard deviation to characterize it.

This theorem gives you the ability to measure how much your sample mean will vary, without having to take any other sample means to compare it with  thankfully! . It basically says that your sample mean has a normal distribution, no matter what the distribution of the original data looks like  as long as your sample size was large enough . See Chapter 9 for more on the central limit theorem  known by statisticians as the "crown jewel of all statistics." Should you even bother to tell them to get a life? .  If a data set has a normal distribution, and you standardize all of the data to obtain standard scores, those standard scores are called Z-values. Z-values have what is known as a standard normal distribution  or Z-distribution . The standard normal distribution is a special normal distribution with a mean equal to 0 and a standard deviation equal to 1. The standard normal distribution is useful for examining the data and determining statistics like percentiles, or the percentage of the data falling between two values. So if researchers determine that the data have a normal distribution, they will usually first standardize the data  by converting each data point into a Z-value , and then use the standard normal distribution to explore and discuss the data in more detail.  TECHNICAL STUFF   Intervals  Experiments An experiment is a study that imposes a certain amount of control on the study's subjects and their environment  for example, restricting their diets, giving them certain dosage levels of a drug or placebo, or asking them to stay awake for a prescribed period of time .

For example, does zinc help to reduce the length of a cold? Subjects who Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade are chosen to participate in the experiment are typically divided into two groups, a treatment group and Part II - Number-Crunching Basics a control group. The treatment group consists of those who receive the treatment that supposedly has Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs an effect on the outcome  in this case, zinc . The control group consists of those who do not receive Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More the treatment, or those who receive a standard, well-known treatment whose results will be compared Part III - Determining the Odds with this new treatment  such as vitamin C, in the case of the zinc study .

It is often given to the members of the control Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! group, so that they will not know whether they are taking the treatment  for example, zinc  or receiving Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error no treatment at all. Placebos are given to the control group in order to control for a phenomena called the placebo effect, in which patients who receive any sort of perceived treatment by taking a pill  even Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence though it's a sugar pill  report some sort of result, be it positive  "Yes, I feel better already"  or negative Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence  "Wow, I am starting to feel a bit dizzy" , due to a psychological effect. Without a placebo, the Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals researchers could not be certain that the results were due to the actual effect of the treatment, Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples because some  or all  of the observed effect could have been due to the placebo effect.

Because so many policymakers, marketers, and others want to "get at the pulse of the American public" and find out what the average American is thinking and feeling, many people now feel that they cannot escape the barrage of requests to take part in surveys and polls. In fact, you've probably received many requests to participate in surveys, and you may even have become numb to them, simply throwing away surveys received in the mail, or saying "no" when you're asked to participate in a telephone survey.  If done properly, a survey can really be informative. People use surveys to find out what TV programs Americans  and others  like how consumers feel about Internet shopping and whether the United States should have a nuclear defense system. Surveys are used by companies to assess the level of satisfaction their customers feel, to find out what products their customers want, and to determine who   is buying their products.

The following sections cover Part IV - Wading through the Results major elements in that process. For more information on making and interpreting estimates, see Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing Chapter 11. Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! Margin of error Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence You've probably heard someone report, "This survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence percentage points." What does this mean? All surveys are based on information collected from a sample of individuals, not the entire population. A certain amount of error is bound to occur — not in Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals the sense of calculation error  although there may be some of that, too  but in the sense of sampling Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples error, or error that's bound to happen simply because the researchers aren't asking everyone. The Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test margin of error is supposed to measure the maximum amount by which the sample results are Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions expected to differ from those of the actual population. Because the results of most survey questions Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples can be reported in terms of percentages, the margin of error most often appears as a percentage, as Part VII - Statistical Studies—The Inside Scoop well. Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? How do you interpret a margin of error? Suppose you know that 51% of those sampled say that they Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations plan to vote for Miss Calculation in the upcoming election. Now, projecting these results to the whole Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control voting population, you would have to add and subtract the margin of error and give a range of possible Part VIII - The Part of Tens results in order to have sufficient confidence that you're bridging the gap between your sample and the Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey population. So, in this case  supposing a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points  you Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes would be pretty confident that between 48% and 54% of the population will vote for Miss Calculation in the election, based on the sample results. In this case, Miss Calculation may get slightly more or Sources slightly less than the majority of votes and could either win or lose the election. This has become a Index familiar situation in recent years, where the media want to report results on Election Night, but based List of Figures on survey results, the election is "too close to call." For more on the margin of error, see Chapter 10. List of Tables List of Sidebars HEADS UP   The margin of error measures accuracy; it does not measure the amount of bias that may be present. Results that look numerically scientific and precise don't mean anything if they were collected in a biased way.  Intervals  Confidence interval When you combine your estimate with the margin of error, you come up with a confidence interval. For example, suppose the average time it takes you to drive to work each day is 35 minutes, with a margin of error of plus or minus 5 minutes. You estimate that the average time to work would be anywhere from 30 to 40 minutes. This estimate is a confidence interval. It takes into account the fact that sample results will vary and gives an indication of how much variation to expect. For more on confidence interval basics, see Chapter 11.   ISBN:0764554239  TECHNICAL STUFF   Some confidence intervals are wider than others  and wide isn't good, because it equals less accuracy . Several factors influence the width of a confidence interval, such as sample size, the amount of variability in the population being studied, and how confident you want to be in your results.  Most researchers are happy with a 95% level of confidence in their results.  For more on factors that influence confidence intervals, see Chapter 12.  Statistics For Dummies by Deborah Rumsey  John Wiley & Sons   2003  356 pages  This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life.  Many different types of confidence intervals are done in scientific research, including confidence intervals for means, proportions, the difference of two means or proportions, or paired differences. For specifics on the most common hypothesis tests, see Chapter 13.  Data are collected, and the probabilities are estimated based on the history of the data  for example, to predict the weather .  Complex math and computer models are used to try to predict future behavior and occurrence of natural phenomena  for example, hurricanes and earthquakes .  Math is used to grind out the numbers  for example, figuring your chances of winning the lottery or determining the hierarchy of hands in poker .    Table of Contents Statistics for Dummies Probability versus odds Introduction Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics A probability is a measurement of the likelihood of an event happening. In other words, a probability is Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life the chance that something will happen. For example, if the chance of rain tomorrow is 30%, it's less Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong likely to rain than not rain tomorrow, but the chance of rain is still 3 out of 10.  Given those chances, Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade will you bring your umbrella with you tomorrow?  A chance of rain of 30% also means that over many, Part II - Number-Crunching Basics many days with the same conditions as those predicted for tomorrow, it rained 30% of the time.

Perhaps it was the local baseball Sources reporter lamenting that his team, who defied the odds by winning 50 games and losing only 12 in the Index first 3 months of the season, were now starting to lose, giving in to the law of averages. Or maybe the List of Figures context was gambling  "The law of averages is bound to catch up with me — I'm on too hot of a List of Tables winning streak!" . What is the law of averages, exactly, and are people using this term properly? List of Sidebars The law of averages is a rule of probability. It says that, in the long term, results will average out to their expected value, but in the short term, no one knows what will happen. For example, casinos set up all of their games so that the chances of the house winning are slightly in their favor. That means that in the long term, as long as people keep playing, the casinos are going to come out ahead, on average. Of course there will be some winners, that's what keeps people playing, knowing they could be among them. But in the long term, the losers outweigh the winners  not to mention the fact that many times people who win big just put their money back into the games again and end up losing . For more on the law of averages, see Chapter 7.  Odds and probability are slightly different. The best way to describe this difference is by looking at an example. Suppose the probability that a certain race horse is going win the race is 1 out of 10. That means his probability of winning is 1 in 10 or 1 ÷ 10 or 0.10. A probability reflects the chances of winning. Now what are this horse's odds of winning? They are 9 to 1. That's because odds are actually a ratio of the chances of losing to the chances of winning. This horse has a 9 in 10 chance of losing and a 1 in 10 chance of winning. Take 9 10 over 1 10 and the 10s cancel, leaving you with 9 1, which in odds lingo is stated as "9 to 1." For more on gambling, see Chapter 7.  HEADS UP   Intervals  Hypothesis testing   ISBN:0764554239  TECHNICAL STUFF   Hypothesis test is a term you probably haven't run across in your everyday dealings with numbers and statistics. But I guarantee that hypothesis tests have been a big part of your life and your workplace, simply because of the major role they play in industry, medicine, agriculture, government, and a host of other areas. Any time you hear someone talking about their results showing a "statistically significant difference", you're encountering the results of a hypothesis test. Basically, a hypothesis test is a statistical procedure in which data are collected and measured against a claim about a population.  Statistics For Dummies by Deborah Rumsey  John Wiley & Sons   2003  356 pages  This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life.  For example, if a pizza delivery chain claims to deliver pizzas within 30 minutes of placing the order, you could test whether this claim is true by collecting a random sample of delivery times over a certain period of time and looking at the average delivery time for that sample.  A variety of hypothesis tests are done in scientific research, including t-tests, paired t-tests, and tests of proportions or means for one or more populations. For specifics on the most common hypothesis tests, see Chapter 15.  Because your decision is based on a sample and not the entire population, a hypothesis test can sometimes lead you to the wrong conclusion.

All hypothesis tests ultimately use a p-value to weigh the strength of the evidence Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing  what the data are telling you about the population . The p-value is a number between 0 and 1 that Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! reflects the strength of the data that are being used to evaluate the null hypothesis. If the p-value is Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error small, you have strong evidence against the null hypothesis. A large p-value indicates weak evidence Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence against the null hypothesis. For example, if a pizza chain claims to deliver pizzas in less than 30 Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence minutes  this is the null hypothesis , and your random sample of 100 delivery times has an average of 40 minutes for the delivery time  which is more than 2 standard deviations above what the average Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals delivery time is supposed to be  the p-value for this test would be small, and you would say you have Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples strong evidence against the pizza chain's claim.

Research that simply confirms something that was already well known doesn't make headlines, unfortunately.

For example, a positive effect that's experienced by a sample of people who took the new treatment may have just been a fluke.  Assume for the moment that you know that the data were not fabricated, fudged, or exaggerated.  The beauty of medical research is that as soon as someone gives a press release saying that he or she found something significant, the rush is on to try to replicate the results, and if the results can't be replicated, this probably means that the original results were wrong, for some reason. Unfortunately, a press release announcing a "major breakthrough" tends to get a lot of play in the media, but follow-up studies refuting those results often don't show up on the front page.

ISBN:0764554239  Correlation and causation   Table of Contents Of all of the misunderstood statistical issues, the most problematic is the misuse of the concepts of Statistics for Dummies correlation and causation. Introduction Correlation means that two numerical variables have some sort of linear relationship. For example, the Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics number of times crickets chirp per second is related to temperature; when it's cold outside, they chirp Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life less frequently, and when it's warm outside they chirp more frequently.  This actually happens to be Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong true!  Another example of correlation has to do with police staffing. The number of crimes  per capita  Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade has often been found to be related to the number of police officers in a given area. When more police Part II - Number-Crunching Basics officers patrol an area, crime tends to be lower, and when fewer police officers are present, crime Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs tends to be higher. However, seemingly unrelated events have also been found to be correlated. One Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More such example is the consumption of ice cream  pints per person  and the number of murders in Part III - Determining the Odds certain areas. Now maybe having more police officers deters crime, but does having people eat less Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability ice cream deter crime? What's the difference? The difference is that with correlation, a link or Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win relationship is found to exist between two variables, x and y. With causation, one makes that leap and Part IV - Wading through the Results says "a change in x will cause a change in y to happen." Too many times in research, in the media, or Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing in the public consumption of statistical results, that leap is made when it shouldn't be. When can it be Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! done? When a well-designed experiment is conducted that eliminates any other factors that could Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error have been related to the outcomes.

Chapter 4: Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs Someone once said that a picture is worth a thousand words. In statistics, a picture may be worth a thousand data points — as long as that picture is done correctly, of course. Data displays, such as charts and graphs, appear often in everyday life. These displays show everything from election results, broken down by every conceivable characteristic, to how the stock market has fared over the past few years. Today's society is a fast-food, fast-information society; everyone wants to know the bottom line   and be spared the details. The main use of statistics is to boil down information into summary form, Table of Contents and data displays are a natural way to do that. But do data displays give you the whole picture of Statistics for Dummies what's happening with the data? That depends on the quality of the data display and its intended Introduction purpose. Pictures can be misleading  sometimes intentionally and sometimes by accident , and not Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics every data display that you see will be correct.

Part II - Number-Crunching Basics Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs Getting Graphic with Statistics Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More Part III - Determining the Odds The main purpose of a data display is to make a certain point, make the point clearly and effectively, Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability and make the point correctly. A chart or graph, for example, is used to give impact to a specific Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win characteristic of the data, highlight changes over time, compare and contrast opinions or demographic Part IV - Wading through the Results data, or show links between pieces of information. Data displays "break down" a statistical story that Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing the author wants to relay about a data set, so that the reader can quickly see the issue at a glance and Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! come to some conclusion. For this reason, data displays are powerful: Used properly, they can be Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error informative and effective; used improperly, they can be misleading and destructive.

Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test Researchers and journalists use different ways to display each of the two major types of data: Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions categorical data, which represent qualities or characteristics  such as gender or political party  and Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples numerical data, which represent measured quantities  such as height or income .

ISBN:0764554239  A pie chart takes categorical data and breaks them down by group, showing the percentage of individuals   that fall into each group. Because a pie chart takes on the shape of a circle, or pie, the "slices" that Table of Contents represent each group can easily be compared and contrasted to one another. Because each individual in Statistics for Dummies the group falls into one and only one category, the sum of all the slices of the pie should be 100% or close Introduction to it  subject to a bit of round-off error .

But they often do not show you the total number in each group, in terms of original units  number of dollars, number of people, and so on . This approach results in a loss of information, may not necessarily present the whole story behind the data, and leaves you wondering what the total amount is that's being divided up. You can always go from amounts to percents, but you can't go from percentages back to the original amounts without knowing a total. With survey results, this lack of information can be a real problem; oftentimes, pie charts show the percentage of people who answered the question in a certain way, but they don't tell you how many people responded to the survey — a critical piece of information needed to assess the accuracy of the results.

For example, the 2001 amount reportedly given to education by the Michigan lottery was $587 million. Because   you know from Table 4-1 that the total lottery sales revenue for Michigan was $1,615 million  aka $1.6 Table of Contents billion , you can calculate the percentage of revenue that was given to education in this state. In Michigan, Statistics for Dummies about 36%  $587 million ÷ $1,615 million × 100%  of the lottery sales revenue was given to education. Introduction Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics Pie charts are easy to use to compare the sizes of slices within a single pie itself, but they can also be used Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life to compare one entire pie to another.

Comparing Figures 4-3 and 4-4, you can see that for the New York lottery, 56% of the money goes to prizes  slightly more than the percentage for Florida , and 33% goes to education  slightly less than the percentage for Florida . Included with each of the New York lottery's pie charts is a table showing the actual dollar amounts, allowing you to see more of the whole story.  However, the New York lottery makes you add the total up for yourself; it's well over $4.5 billion dollars.   The state of New York also wants you to realize how much money it's putting toward education, in terms of a piece of the school-revenue pie  which is a very smart move, politically speaking . Figure 4-5 shows that whereas 4% of New York school revenue in 2001–2002 came from federal aid, 5% came from the New York lottery. Again, this pie chart also comes with a table showing the actual dollar amounts.  In actuality,   the only amount that's needed is the grand total dollar amount, because from the grand total and the percents in the pie chart, you can generate the numbers in the table. Not having to do that extra work is nice, however.

This chart would have more visual impact if the IRS had shown the actual "slices" of pizza that correspond to the percentages in the table. What's nice about this display, however, is Part IV - Wading through the Results that it shows the amount of money as well as the percentages that are spent in each area.

Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes Sources Predicting population trends Index List of Figures The U.S. Census Bureau provides many data displays in its reports about the U.S. population. Figure 4-7 List of Tables shows two pie charts comparing the racial breakdown of the United States in 1995  actual figures  with the List of Sidebars projected racial breakdown in 2050, if current trends continue. You can see that in 1995, about 73.6% of the U.S. population was White, while Blacks made up the second highest group at 12.0%, closely followed by those of Hispanic origin, who comprised 10.2% of the population.  Note that although Hispanics are typically white or black, they are shown here as a separate category, independent of racial background.  The Census Bureau projects that Whites will be a declining share of the total U.S. population in the future, whereas the Hispanic share of the population will grow faster than that of non-Hispanic Blacks. This point is made well using the two pie charts, as opposed to tables simply showing the percentages.  Ideally, a pie chart doesn't have too many slices because a large number of slices distracts the reader from the big issues that the pie chart is trying to relay. However, if lumping all of those remaining categories into a category called "other" results in a category that's one of the largest ones in the whole pie chart, readers are left wondering what's included in that slice of pie.

Raising the Bar on Bar Graphs A bar graph, or bar chart, is perhaps the most common data display used by the media. Like a pie chart, a bar graph breaks categorical data down by group, showing how many are in each group. A bar graph, however, represents those groups by using bars of different lengths, rather than as pie slices of varying sizes. And whereas a pie chart most often reports the amount in each group as percentages, a bar graph uses either the number of individuals in each group or the percentage of the   total in each group. In a bar graph, the length of each bar indicates the number or percent in each Table of Contents group. Statistics for Dummies Introduction Tracking transportation expenses Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life How much of their income do people spend on transportation? It depends on how much money they Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong make.

It appears that as household income increases, the total expenditures on Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? transportation also increase. This probably makes sense, because the more money people have, the Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations more they have available to spend. But would the bar graph change if you looked at transportation Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control expenditures not in terms of total dollar amounts, but as the percentage of household income? The households in the first group make less than $5,000 a year and have to spend $2,500 on Part VIII - The Part of Tens transportation per year.  Notice that the table reads "2.5", but because the units are in thousands of Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey dollars, the 2.5 translates into $2,500.  This $2,500 represents 50% of the annual income of those who Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes make $5,000 per year; it's an even higher percentage of the total income for those who make less Sources than $5,000 per year. The households earning $30,000–$40,000 per year pay $6,000 per year on Index transportation, which is between 15% and 20% of their household income. So, although the people List of Figures making more money spend more dollars on transportation, they don't spend more as a percentage of List of Tables their total income. Depending on how you look at expenditures, the bar graph can tell two somewhat List of Sidebars different stories.  This bar graph has another peculiarity. The categories for household income as shown aren't equivalent. For example, each of the first four bars represents household incomes in intervals of $5,000, but the next three groups increase by $10,000 each, and the last group contains every household making more than $50,000 per year, which is a large percentage of households, even in 1994. Bar graphs with different category ranges, such as the one shown in Figure 4-8, make comparison between groups more difficult.  Highlighting mothers in the workforce   Bar graphs are often used to compare two groups by breaking down the categories for each group and showing them as side-by-side bars. One example of this is shown in Figure 4-9, which asks the question, "Has the percentage of mothers in the workforce changed over time?" The answer is yes. Figure 4-9 shows that the overall percentage of mothers in the workforce climbed from 47% to 72% between 1975 and 1998. Taking the age of the child into account, fewer mothers work while their children are younger and not in school yet, but the difference from 1975 to 1998 is still about 25% in each case, as shown by the side-by-side bars.

Notice that throughout the Ohio lottery example, the units have been in terms of millions, so you see funny looking numbers like $1,983.1 million, which really should be written as $1.9831 billion. Why does the Ohio lottery use units in millions? Maybe to make it look like it isn't bringing in as much money as it really is. The numbers do look tamed down a bit in Figure 4-10.

Someone may try to say that this represents a 160% increase, or about 1.6 times as many plural births in 25 years  [1,982 – List of Tables 763] ÷ 763 . More plural births occurred in the year 2000 than in 1975, but more single births also occurred over this List of Sidebars same time period. Because of this, the only accurate way to compare these statistics is to calculate the percentage of single versus plural births and compare these percentages. Looking at Table 4-2, you can see that the percentage of plural births in 1975 was 1.9%, while in 2000 the percentage of plural births was 3.0%. You can conclude that the percentage of plural births did increase over time, even after taking the increased number of births into account.

Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control Two features of this table are noticeable right away. First, the IRS reports statistics for many different reporting years Part VIII - The Part of Tens on the same table, for example FY2001  which means fiscal year 2001, or the 12-month period from July 1, 2000 Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey through June 30, 2001 , TY1999  which means tax year, or calendar year, 1999 , and TY 2000. Note that the tax Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes year and the fiscal year overlap, and that the tax returns for TY 2000, for example, are due to the IRS in April, 2001  which is in FY 2001 . How's that for confusion? Also notice that you can't compare the median adjusted gross Sources income  median AGI  in this table to the top 1% or top 10% AGI in the same table, because these figures are listed Index for different years  TY 2000 and TY 1999, respectively . List of Figures List of Tables Second, the way the IRS reports the dollar units can lead to confusion. For example, the gross collections for List of Sidebars individual tax returns for FY 2001  reported to be in millions of dollars  is listed as 1,178,210. This means that $1,178,210 million dollars were collected from individual tax returns. Now you typically don't display dollar amounts that way. To put this into proper perspective, $1,178,210 million is actually $1,178,210,000,000, which is $1.178 trillion. No wonder the IRS didn't report these revenues that way, it's too big of a number to even fathom!  167.6  REMEMBER When looking at a table, be sure you understand the units that are being expressed and watch for  changes in units  such as the year  throughout the table.  Table 4-5 is intended to show several points; here are a few of them. In the tax year 2000, the ratio of people who claimed the standard deduction relative to people who itemized their deductions, is about 2 to 1.  A pie chart would show this very nicely.  About half of the people who filed for the tax year 2000 used tax preparers, and the percentage who e-filed for the tax year 2001 was about 38%  a percentage the IRS probably would like to see   increase over time . The average refund for the tax year 2000 was $1,802.15  the total amount of refund dollars in billions, divided by the total number of refunds, in millions .  Now, isn't it more impressive to report the total amount of refund dollars, as opposed to the average refund amount?  Also notice that the IRS didn't report the total number of tax returns filed for the tax year 2000 or the percentage of tax filers who received a refund for that tax year. Knowing this percent would be more useful than knowing the total number of refunds in a given tax year. After all, not everyone got a refund — plenty of people had to pay or paid exactly the right amount.

Percentages are often the most sensible statistic to use for comparing different results.  With numerical data, be sure that the groups in the table don't overlap and that the groups are divided evenly for an equitable comparison.  Look at the way the information is presented.

Keeping Pace with Time Charts A time chart is a data display whose main point is to examine trends over time. Another name for a time chart is a line graph. Typically a time chart will have some unit of time on the horizontal axis  such as year, day, month, and so on  and some measured quantity on the vertical axis  such as average household income, birth rate, total sales, percentage of people in favor of the president, and so on . At each time period, the amount is represented by a dot, and the dots are connected to form the time   chart. Table of Contents Statistics for Dummies Analyzing wage trends Introduction Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics In 1999, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics put out a report on work trends in the United States, and Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life what the outlook was for the future. Its report includes many time charts, including the two shown in Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong Figure 4-11 and Figure 4-12. Figure 4-11 shows the trend over time in the average hourly wage for Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade production workers from 1947 to 1998.  Because of inflation, it wouldn't make sense to simply show Part II - Number-Crunching Basics the actual hourly wages over this time period. You want to know the information in terms of "real Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs wages" — in other words, something comparable over time. Here, the bureau shows everything in Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More terms of 1998 dollars for equitable comparison over time.  You can see from Figure 4-11 that wages Part III - Determining the Odds for production workers increased from 1947 until the early 1970s, declined during the 1970s, and Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability basically stayed in the same range until the late 1990s, when a small surge began.

HEADS UP   Statistics tell you facts — in other words, they tell you what's occurring. But they don't explain why events are occurring as they are. The report put out by the Bureau of Labor Statistics not only presents data showing wage trends, but also goes beyond data presentation to discuss some of the reasons why the average production wage stagnated from the late '70s to the mid '90s and why the earnings gap for more-educated versus less-educated workers is growing. Answering the "why" question is much more complex than answering the "what" question. Although the Bureau of Labor Statistics certainly has other statistics to back up its assessment of why the trends are doing what they're doing, not everyone who puts out statistics does.

ISBN:0764554239  REMEMBER Many folks try to take a simple data display and use it not only to show what's  happening, but also to try to explain why things are happening as they are. Without sufficient data, these people may be making false conclusions. If you suspect someone is going too far with his or her conclusions, you need to question whether these conclusions are justified.

Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control Part VIII - The Part of Tens Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey HEADS Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes UP  Sources Index For the Colorado plural births example, the increase in plural births over time can be made to look List of Figures more dramatic by changing the increments on the vertical axis from 1% to 0.2%, which would stretch List of Tables out the graph vertically. Likewise, the trend could be made to look almost nonexistent by changing the List of Sidebars increments on the vertical axis from 1% to 5%. The most reasonable increment is something between 0.2% and 5%. I chose 1% increments for my version of this graph.  As with a bar graph, differences that are represented using a time chart can be played up or down by changing the scale on the vertical axis, so be sure to take the scale into account when interpreting the results of a time chart.  Figure 4-13: Percent plural births for Colorado residents, 1975–2000.  Another factor to consider with time charts is the time axis, or how close together or far apart the data points in the chart are. Data that are close together in time but have very different quantities will make the time chart appear jagged. This is typical of time charts that represent volatile data, such as stock market prices over the course of a day, as you may have seen on television business news programs. Other time charts may show more sweeping, long-term changes, such as those in Figure 4-13, which shows only the percentage of plural births every five years, rather than every single year. Again, this depends on how the person designing the chart wants you to look at the information. You need to really think about how the chart was set up and, potentially, ask additional questions in order to clear up any confusion.   HEADS UP   You can also run into a problem in which a time chart presents the information in an unfair way, such as charting the number of crimes over time, rather than the crime rate  number of crimes per capita . Make sure that you understand what statistics are being presented in the chart, and then examine them for fairness and appropriateness  see Chapter 2 for more on this .  Statistics For Dummies by Deborah Rumsey  John Wiley & Sons   2003  356 pages  This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life.  ISBN:0764554239  Evaluating a time chart  Tip To see whether a time chart is on pace, statistically:  Take into account the units used in the chart and be sure they're appropriate for comparison over time  for example, are dollar amounts being adjusted for inflation? .  Beware of people trying to explain why a trend is occurring without using additional statistics to back up their claims. A time chart generally shows what is happening. Why something is happening is another story!

Although most of the media favors the use of tables to organize numerical data, statisticians favor the histogram as their data display of choice for these kind of data. What is a histogram, you ask?  Statistics For Dummies by Deborah Rumsey  John Wiley & Sons   2003  356 pages  This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life.  A histogram is basically a bar graph that applies to numerical data. Because the data are numerical, the categories are ordered from smallest to largest  as opposed to categorical data, such as gender, which has no inherent order to it . And because you want to be sure each number falls into exactly one group, the bars on a histogram touch each other but don't overlap. Each bar is marked on the x-axis  or horizontal axis  by the value representing its midpoint. For example, suppose a histogram showing length of time until failure of a car part  in hours  has two adjacent bars marked with midpoints of   Table of Contents 1,000 hours and 2,000 hours, and each bar has a width of 500 hours. This means the first bar represents car parts that lasted anywhere from 500 to 1,500 hours, and the second bar represents car Statistics for Dummies parts that lasted anywhere from 1,500 to 2,500 hours.  Numbers on the border can go on either side, Introduction as long as you're consistent for all the borderline values.  Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life The height of each bar of a histogram represents either the number of individuals in each group  also Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong known as the frequency of each group  or the percentage of individuals in each group  also known as Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade the relative frequency of each group . For example, if 50% of the car parts lasted between 500 and Part II - Number-Crunching Basics 1,500 hours, the first bar in the preceding example would have a relative frequency of 50%, and the Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs height of that bar would be reflective of that. Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More Part III - Determining the Odds You can see a histogram of the state population data in Figure 4-14. You can easily answer most of Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability the questions at the beginning of this section by looking quickly at the histogram.

Another 25.5% have populations of between 5 and 10 million. This means that 86.3% of the List of Tables states haves fewer than 10 million people each. Each of the remaining seven states has very large populations, making the histogram look lopsided and trailing off to the right  this is called skewed to List of Sidebars the right . Except for those few very large states, the populations of the states aren't as variable as you may think. The histogram doesn't tell you which state is which, of course, but a quick sorting of the original data can tell you which states are largest and smallest. The five most populous states are California, Texas, New York, Florida, and Illinois  which is closely followed by Pennsylvania . The smallest state is Wyoming with about 494,000 people.  Figure 4-14: State population sizes  2000 Census .  Tip If questions come up while you're looking at a data display, try to get access to the original  data set. Researchers should be able to provide you with their data if you ask for them.  Analyzing mothers' ages   ISBN:0764554239  In one birth statistics example  refer to Table 4-3 , the age of the mother is shown for various years from 1975 to 2000. For any year on the table, the age variable is divided into groups, and you're given the number of mothers in each group. Because you're given the total numbers, you can make a histogram of mothers' ages showing either the frequencies or the relative frequencies, whichever is the most appropriate in terms of the point you want to make.  Statistics For Dummies by Deborah Rumsey  John Wiley & Sons   2003  356 pages  This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life.  Suppose you want to compare the ages of mothers in 1975 and 2000. You can make two histograms, one for each year, and compare the results. Figure 4-15 shows two such histograms for 1975  top  and 2000  bottom . Notice that the relative frequencies  or percentages  are shown on the vertical axis, and the age groups for the mothers are shown on the horizontal axis.    Table of Contents A histogram can summarize the features of numerical data quite well. One of the features that a Statistics for Dummies histogram can show you is the so-called shape of the data  in other words, how the data are Introduction distributed among the groups . Are the data distributed evenly, in a uniform way? Are the data Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics symmetric, meaning that the left-hand side of the histogram is a mirror image of the right-hand side of Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life the histogram? Does the histogram have a U-shape, with lots of data on extreme ends and not much Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong in the middle? Does the histogram of the data have a bell-shape, meaning that it looks like a mound in Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade the middle with tails trailing off in either direction as you move away from the center? Or is the Part II - Number-Crunching Basics histogram skewed, meaning that it looks like a lopsided mound with one long tail either going off to the Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs right  indicating the data are skewed right  or going off to the left  indicating the data are skewed left ? Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More Part III - Determining the Odds Mothers' ages in Figure 4-15 for years 1975 and 2000 appear to be mostly mound-shaped, although Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability the data for 1975 are slightly more skewed to the right, indicating that as the women got older, fewer of them had babies, relative to the situation in the year 2000. Another way of saying this is that in the year Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win 2000, a higher proportion of older women were having babies compared to 1975.

You can also get a sense of how much variability exists in the data by looking at a histogram. If a histogram is quite flat with the bars close to the same height, you may think this indicates less variability because the heights of the bars are similar. In fact, the opposite is true. That's because you have an equal number in each bar, but the bars themselves represent different ranges of values, so the entire data set is actually quite spread out. Now if the histogram has a big lump in the middle with tails on the sides, this indicates that more data are in the middle bars than the outer bars, so the data are actually closer together. Comparing 1975 mothers' ages to 2000 mothers' ages, you see more   ISBN:0764554239  HEADS UP   variability in 2000 than in 1975. This, again, indicates changing times; more of today's women are waiting to have children, compared to 1975, when most women had their children by age 30, and the length of time they're waiting varies.  Chapter 5 shows you ways to measure variability in a data set.   Statistics For Dummies by Deborah Rumsey  John Wiley & Sons   2003  356 pages  This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life.  Variability in a histogram should not be confused with variability in a time chart  see the "Keeping Pace with Time Charts" section . If values change over time, they're shown on a time chart as highs and lows, and many changes from high to low  over time  indicate lots of variability. So, a flat line on a time chart indicates no change and no variability in the values across time. However, when the heights of bars of a histogram appear to be flat  uniform , this shows the opposite — the values are spread out uniformly over many groups, indicating a great deal of variability in the data at one point in time.  Watch for histograms that use unusual scales to mislead readers. As with bar graphs, you can exaggerate differences by using a smaller scale on the vertical axis of a histogram, and you can play down differences by using a larger scale.    Table of Contents Statistics for Dummies A histogram can also give you some idea of where the center of the data lies. The center of a data set Introduction is measured in different ways  see Chapter 5 for a discussion of these measures . One way to eyeball Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics the center on a histogram is to think of the histogram as a picture of people sitting on a teeter-totter Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life and the center as the point where the fulcrum has to be in order to balance the weight on each side. Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong Refer to Figure 4-15, which shows the ages of Colorado mothers in 1975 and 2000, and note that the Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade mid-point appears to be around 25 years for the 1975 histogram and around 27.5 years for the 2000 Part II - Number-Crunching Basics histogram. This suggests that in the year 2000, Colorado women were having children at older ages, Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs on average, than they did in 1975. Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More Part III - Determining the Odds Histograms aren't as commonly found in the media as they should be. The reason for this is not clear, Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability and tables are much more commonly used to show breakdowns for numerical data. However, a histogram can be informative, especially when used to compare one group or time period to another.

A happy medium exists in terms of the number of groupings used and the range of values they represent. Each histogram is slightly different, but somewhere between 6 and 12 groupings is a generally a good number of bars for a histogram. If the histogram has too few bars, the data don't show anything; if it has too many, the data are too disjointed and patterns get lost.  HEADS UP   REMEMBER Be sure to take the scale into account on both the horizontal and vertical axes when examining the results presented in a histogram.

Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error Summarizing statistics has other purposes, as well. After all of the data have been collected from a Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence survey or some other kind of study, the next step is for the researcher to try to make sense out of the Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence data. Typically, the first step researchers take is to run some basic statistics on the data to get a rough idea about what's happening in the data. Later in the process, researchers can do more analyses to Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals formulate or test claims made about the population, estimate certain characteristics about the Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples population, look for links between items they measured, and so on.

Summarizing Categorical Data Categorical data capture qualities or characteristics about the individual, such as a person's eye color, gender, political party, or opinion on some issue  using categories such as agree, disagree, or no opinion . Categorical data tend to fall into groups or categories pretty naturally. "Political party", for example, typically has four groups: Democrat, Republican, Independent, and other. Categorical data often come from survey data, but they can also be collected in experiments. For example, in an   experimental test of a new medical treatment, researchers may use three categories to assess the Table of Contents outcome of the experiment: Did the patient get better, worse, or stay the same while undergoing the Statistics for Dummies treatment? Introduction Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics Categorical data are often summarized by reporting the percentage of individuals falling into each Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life category. For example, pollsters may report the percentage of Republicans, Democrats, Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong Independents, and others who took part in a survey. To calculate the percentage of individuals in a certain category, find the number of individuals in that category, divide by the total number of people in Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade the study, and then multiply by 100%. For example, if a survey of 2,000 teenagers included 1,200 Part II - Number-Crunching Basics females and 800 males, the resulting percentages would be  1,200 ÷ 2,000  × 100% = 60% female Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs and  800 ÷ 2,000  × 100% = 40% male. Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More Part III - Determining the Odds You can further break down categorical data by creating something called crosstabs. Crosstabs  also Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability called two-way tables  are tables with rows and columns. They summarize the information from two Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win categorical variables at once, such as gender and political party, so you can see  or easily calculate  Part IV - Wading through the Results the percentage of individuals in each combination of categories. For example, if you had data about Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing the gender and political party of your respondents, you would be able to look at the percentage of Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! Republican females, Republican males, Democratic females, Democratic males, and so on. In this Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error example, the total number of possible combinations in your table would be 2 × 4 = 8, or the total Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence number of gender categories times the total number of party affiliation categories. Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence The U.S. government calculates and summarizes loads of categorical data using crosstabs. The U.S. Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals Census Bureau doesn't just count the population; it also collects and summarizes data from a subset Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples of all Americans  those who fill out the long form  on various demographic characteristics, such as gender and age. Typical age and gender data, reported by the U.S. Census Bureau for a survey Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test conducted in 2001, are shown in Table 5-1.  Normally, age would be considered a numerical variable, Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions but the way the U.S. government reports it, age is broken down into categories, making it a categorical Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples variable.

Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations You can examine many different facets of the population by looking at and working with different Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control numbers from Table 5-1. Looking at gender, notice that women slightly outnumber men, because the Part VIII - The Part of Tens population in 2001 was 51% female  divide total number of females by total population size and Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey multiply by 100%  and 49% male  divide total number of males by total population size and multiply by Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes 100% . You can also look at age: The percentage of the entire population that is age 5 and under was Sources 6.8%; the largest group belongs to the 40–44 year olds, who made up 8% of the population. Next, you Index can explore a possible relationship between gender and age by comparing various parts of the table. List of Figures You can compare, for example, the percentage of females to males in the 80-and-over age group. List of Tables Because these data are reported in five-year increments, you have to do a little math in order to get List of Sidebars your answer, though. The percentage of the population that's female and aged 80 and above is 2.22% + 1.35% + 0.6% + 0.16% + 0.03% = 4.36%. The percentage of males aged 80 and over is 1.38% + 0.66% + 0.22% + 0.04% + 0.01% = 2.31%. This shows that the 80-and-over age group contains almost twice as many women as men. These data seem to confirm the notion that women tend to live longer than men.  100   HEADS UP   If you're given the number of individuals in each group, you can always calculate your own percents. But if you're only given percentages without the total number in the group, you can never retrieve the original number of individuals in each group. For example, you could hear that 80% of the people surveyed prefer Cheesy cheese crackers over Crummy cheese crackers. But how many were surveyed? It could be only 10 people, for all you know, because 8 out of 10 is 80%, just as 800 out of 1,000 is 80%. These two fractions  8 out of 10 and 800 out of 1,000  have different meanings for statisticians, because in the first case, the statistic is based on very little data, and in the second case, it's based on a lot of data.

Summarizing Numerical Data With numerical data, measurable characteristics such as height, weight, IQ, age, or income are represented by numbers. Because the data have numerical meaning, you can summarize them in more ways than is possible with categorical data. Certain characteristics of a numerical data set can be described using statistics, such as where the center is, how spread out the data are, and where certain milestones are. These kinds of summaries occur often in the media, so knowing what these   summary statistics say and don't say about the data helps you better understand the research that's Table of Contents presented to you in your everyday life. Statistics for Dummies Introduction Getting centered Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life The most common way to summarize a numerical data set is to describe where the center is. One way Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong of thinking about what the center of a data set means is to ask, "What's a typical value?" Or, "Where is Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade the middle of the data?"

Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations So, for the 2001–2002 season, the average salary for the Lakers was about $4.2 million. But does the Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control average always tell the whole story? In some cases, the average may be a bit misleading, and this is Part VIII - The Part of Tens one of those cases. That's because every year, a few top-notch players  like Shaq  make much more Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey money than anybody else  and, like Shaq, they also tend to be taller than anyone else, by the way . Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes These are called outliers  numbers in the data set that are extremely high or extremely low, compared Sources to the rest of the data . Because of the way the average is calculated, outliers that are high tend to Index drive the average upward  just like Shaq's salary did in the preceding example . Similarly, outliers that List of Figures are extremely low tend to drive the average downward.

Remember how the teacher didn't change the grading scale to reflect the poor performance of most of the class?

REMEMBER Another word that's used for average is the word mean.  Intervals  What can you report, other than the average, to show what the salary of a "typical" NBA player would be or what the test score of a "typical" student in your class was? Another statistic that is used to measure the center of a data set is called the median. The median is still an unsung hero of statistics in the sense that it isn't used nearly as often as it should be, although people are beginning to report it more and more nowadays. Splitting salaries down the median  1.   The median of a data set is the value that lies exactly in the middle. Here are the steps for finding the median of a data set:  1.  2.

Table of Contents Statistics for Dummies The salaries for the Los Angeles Lakers during the 2001–2002 season  refer to Table 5-2  are already Introduction ordered from smallest  starting at the bottom  to largest  at the top . Because the list contains the Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics names and salaries of 13 players, the middle salary is the seventh one from the bottom  or top , or the Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life salary of Samaki Walker, who earned $1.4 million that season from the Lakers. This is the median. Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade This median salary for the Lakers is well below the average of $4.2 million for this team. But because the average Laker salary includes outliers  like the salary of Shaquille O'Neal , the median salary is Part II - Number-Crunching Basics more representative of the middle salary for the team.  Notice that only 3 players earned more than Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs the average Laker salary of $4.2 million, while 6 players earned more than the median salary of $1.4 Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More million.  The median isn't affected by the salaries of those players who are way out there on the high Part III - Determining the Odds end, the way the average is.  By the way, the lowest Lakers' salary for the 2001–2002 season was Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability $465,850 — a lot of money by most people's standards but mere peanuts compared to what you think Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win of when you think of an NBA player's salary!

Variability is what makes the Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? field of statistics what it is. For example, the price of homes varies from house to house, from year to Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations year, and from state to state. Household income varies from household to household, from country to Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control country, and from year to year. The number of passing yards a quarterback achieves in a game varies from player to player, from game to game, and from season to season. The amount of time that it Part VIII - The Part of Tens takes you to get to work each day varies from day to day. The trick to dealing with variation is to be Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey able to measure that variability in a way that best captures it. Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes Sources Knowing what standard deviation means Index List of Figures By far the most commonly used measure of variability is the standard deviation. The standard List of Tables deviation represents the typical distance from any point in the data set to the center. It's roughly the List of Sidebars average distance from the center, and in this case, the center is the average. Most often, you don't hear a standard deviation given just by itself; if it's reported  and it's not reported nearly enough  it will probably be in the fine print, usually given in parentheses, like " s = 2.68 ."  TECHNICAL STUFF   The standard deviation of an entire population of data is denoted with a Greek letter v. The standard deviation of a sample from the population is denoted with the letter s. Because most of the time the population standard deviation isn't a value that's known, any formulas involving the standard deviation would leave you high and dry without something to plug in for it. But, never fear. When in Rome, do as the Romans do, right? So when dealing with statistics, do as the statisticians do — whenever they are stuck with an unknown value, they just estimate it and move on! So s is used to estimate v in cases where v is unknown.   In this book, when I use the term standard deviation, I mean s, the sample standard deviation.  If and when I refer to the population standard deviation, I let you know!  Calculating the standard deviation  Statistics For Dummies by Deborah Rumsey  John Wiley & Sons   2003  356 pages  This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life.

Subtracting the mean from each number, you get  1 -  4  = - 3,  3 -  4   = - 1,  5 -  4  = +1, Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions and  7 -  4  = +3. Squaring each of these results, you get 9, 1, 1, and 9. Adding these up, the sum is Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples 20. In this example, n = 4, and therefore n -  1 = 3, so you divide 20 by 3 to get 6.67. Finally, you take Part VII - Statistical Studies—The Inside Scoop the square root of 6.67, which is 2.58, and that is the standard deviation of this data set. So for the data Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls set 1, 3, 5, 7, the typical distance from the mean is 2.58. Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results?

Basically, a small List of Figures standard deviation means that the values in the data set are close to the middle of the data set, on List of Tables average, while a large standard deviation means that the values in the data set are farther away from List of Sidebars the middle, on average.  REMEMBER Because calculating the standard deviation involves many steps, in most cases, you will probably have a computer calculate it for you. But knowing how to calculate the standard deviation helps you better interpret this statistic and can help you figure out when the statistic may be wrong.  A small standard deviation can be a goal in certain situations where the results are restricted  for example, in product manufacturing and quality control . A particular type of car part that has to be centimeters in diameter to fit properly had better not have a very big standard deviation. A big standard deviation in this case would mean that lots of parts end up in the trash because they don't fit right; either that, or the cars will have problems down the road.  In situations where you just observe and record data, a large standard deviation isn't necessarily a bad thing; it just reflects a large amount of variability in the group that is being studied. For example, if you look at salaries for everyone in a certain company, including everyone from the student intern to the CEO, the standard deviation could be very large. On the other hand, if you narrow the group down by   looking only at the student interns or only at the corporate executives, the standard deviation will be smaller, because the individuals within each of those two groups have salaries that are less variable.

Watch for the units when determining whether a standard deviation is large. For example, a standard deviation of 2 in units of years is equivalent to a standard deviation of 24 in units of months. Also look at the value of the mean when putting standard deviation into perspective. If the average number of Internet newsgroups that a user posts to is 5.2, and the standard deviation is 3.4, that's a lot of variability, relatively speaking. But if you're talking about the age of the newsgroup users, where the mean is 25.6 years, a standard deviation of 3.4 would be comparatively smaller.  ISBN:0764554239  Intervals    Table of Contents Another way to interpret standard deviation is to use it in conjunction with the mean to describe where Statistics for Dummies most of the data are. If the data are distributed in a bell-shaped curve  with lots of data close to the Introduction middle, with fewer values as you move away from the middle  you can use something called the Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics empirical rule to interpret the standard deviation.  See Chapter 4.  The empirical rule says that about Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life 68% of the data should lie within one standard deviation of either side of the mean; about 95% of the Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong data should lie within two standard deviations of the mean, and about 99% of the data should lie within Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade three standard deviations of the mean. Part II - Number-Crunching Basics Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs In a study of how people make friends in cyberspace using newsgroups, for example, the age of the Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More users of an Internet newsgroup was reported to have a mean of 31.65 years, with a standard deviation Part III - Determining the Odds of 8.61 years. The data were distributed in a bell-shaped curve. According to the empirical rule, about Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability 68% of the newsgroup users had ages within 1 standard deviation  8.61 years  of the mean  31.65 years . So, about 68% of the users were between ages 31.65-8.61 years and 31.65 + 8.61 years, or Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win between 23.04 and 40.26 years. About 95% of the users were between the ages of 31.65 - 2 8.61 , Part IV - Wading through the Results and 31.65 + 2 8.61 , or between 14.43 and 48.87 years. Finally, about 99% of the Internet users' ages Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing were between 31.65 - 3 8.61  and 31.65 + 3 8.61 , or between 5.82 and 57.48 years.  For more Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! applications of the empirical rule, see Chapter 8.  Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence  REMEMBER Most people don't bother trying to account for 99% of the values in a data set; they're usually happy with 95%. Going out one more standard deviation on either side of the mean just to pick up an extra 4% of the data  99% – 95%  doesn't seem worthwhile to many people.  The smallest possible value for the standard deviation is 0, and that happens only in contrived situations where every single number in the data set is exactly the same  no deviation .  The standard deviation can never be a negative number.  That's because of how it's calculated and the fact that it measures a distance; distances are never negative numbers.

If you find out only where the center of the data is without some measure of how variable those data are, you have only part of the story. In fact, you could be missing the most interesting part of the story. Variety is the spice of life, yet without an indication of how diverse or varied the data are, you're not being told how spicy the data are.  The standard deviation is affected by outliers  extremely low or extremely high numbers in the data set . That's because the standard deviation is based on the distance from the mean. And remember, the mean is also affected by outliers.  The standard deviation has the same units as the original data.  Without knowing the standard deviation, you can't get a handle on whether all the data are close to the average  as are the diameters of car parts that come off of a conveyor belt when everything is operating correctly  or whether the data are spread out over a wide range  as are the salaries of NBA players . If someone told you that the average starting salary for someone working at Company Statistix is $70,000, you may think, "Wow! That's great." But if the standard deviation for starting   ISBN:0764554239  HEADS UP   salaries at Company Statistix is $20,000, by using the empirical rule assuming that the distribution of salaries is bell-shaped, you could be making anywhere from $30,000 to $110,000  that is, $70,000, plus or minus two standard deviations, each worth $20,000 . Company Statistix has a lot of variation in terms of how much money you can make, so the average starting salary of $70,000 isn't as informative in the end, is it? On the other hand, if the standard deviation was only $5,000, you would have a much better idea of what to expect for a starting salary at that company.  Statistics For Dummies by Deborah Rumsey  John Wiley & Sons   2003  356 pages  This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples REMEMBER Without the standard deviation, you can't compare two data sets effectively. What if that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life. the two sets of data have about the same average and the same median; does that mean that the data are all the same? Not at all. For example, the data sets 199, 200, 201, and 0, 200, 400 both have the same average, which is 200, and the same median, which is also 200. Yet they have very different standard deviations. The first data set has a very small standard deviation compared to the second data set.    Table of Contents Statistics for Dummies Introduction Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics Journalists often don't report the standard deviation. The only reason I can think of for this is that Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life people must not ask for it — perhaps the public just isn't ready for the standard deviation yet. But Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong reference to the standard deviation may become more commonplace in the media as more and more Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade people discover what the standard deviation can tell them about a set of results. And in many Part II - Number-Crunching Basics workplaces, the standard deviation is frequently reported and used, because this statistic is a standard Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs and well-accepted way of measuring variation. Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More Being out of range Part III - Determining the Odds Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability Many times, the media will report the range of a data set as a way to measure the variability. The Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win range is the largest value in the data set minus the smallest value in the data set. The range is easy to Part IV - Wading through the Results find; all you do is put the numbers in order  from smallest to largest  and do a quick subtraction. Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing Maybe that's why the range is used so often; it certainly isn't because of its interpretative value. Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence  The range of a data set is almost meaningless. It depends on only two numbers in the data set, both of which could reflect extreme values  outliers . My advice is to ignore the range and try to find the standard deviation, which is a more informative measure of the Intervals variability in the data set.  Tip When you come across summary statistics, look for the standard deviation to get a handle on how much variation is in the data. If it's not available, ask for it, or go to the source  the press release, the journal article, the researchers themselves , where you are sure to find it. Don't put much credibility in the range; it's too rough of an estimate of variability to account for much of anything.  Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples NBA salaries, as expected, have great deal of variability. Salaries for one single team, the Los Angeles Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test Lakers, for the 2001–2002 season are a typical example. Reference Table 5-2 for the salaries of all 13 Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions players on the team. The average salary is $4,168,069.77, and the median is $1,400,000. The salaries Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples range from the highest, which is $21,428,572  Shaquille O'Neal  to the lowest, $465,850  Stanislav Medvedenko  with a range of $21,428,572 - $465,850 = $20,962,722. Wow — that's a huge range! It Part VII - Statistical Studies—The Inside Scoop Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls signifies a big difference between the highest and lowest paid players, that's for sure. But does it mean Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? much in terms of the overall variability in salaries for the whole team? Not really. The standard deviation is $5.98 million, which is still a very big number, but because the standard deviation is based Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations on all the salaries of the team  not just the largest and the smallest ones  the standard deviation has Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control much more statistical meaning than the range does. Part VIII - The Part of Tens Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes Sources Index List of Figures List of Tables List of Sidebars Determining where you stand: Percentiles Everyone wants to know how they compare to everyone else. In school, what you got on a test mattered less than how your test score compared to the scores of the other kids in the class. Exams such as the GRE and ACT often keep the total number of points the same each year, while student performances vary as each test changes from year to year. So, along with your score, you always get an accounting of what your score means relative to the others who took the same exam with you. In other words, you find out your relative standing in the group. Understanding percentiles The most common way to report relative standing is by using percentiles. A percentile is the   1.  ISBN:0764554239  HEADS UP   percentage of individuals in the data set who are below you. If you're at the 90th percentile, for example, that means 90% of the people taking the exam with you scored lower than you did. And that also means that 10 percent scored higher than you did, because the total has to add up to 100%.  Everybody taking the test has to show up somewhere relative to your score, right?   Statistics For Dummies by Deborah Rumsey  John Wiley & Sons   2003  356 pages  This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life.  A percentile is not a score in and of itself. Suppose your score on the GRE was reported to be the 80th percentile. This doesn't mean you scored 80% of the questions correctly. It means that 80% of the students' scores were lower than yours, and 20% of the students' scores were higher than yours.   Calculating percentiles Table of Contents Statistics for Dummies To calculate the kth percentile  where k is any number between one and one hundred , do the Introduction following steps: Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade Part II - Number-Crunching Basics Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs Count the numbers from left to right  from the smallest to the largest number  until you Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More reach the value from Step 3. Part III - Determining the Odds Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability For example, suppose you have 25 test scores, and when they're put in order from lowest to highest, Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win they look like this: 43, 54, 56, 61, 62, 66, 68, 69, 69, 70, 71, 72, 77, 78, 79, 85, 87, 88, 89, 93, 95, 96, Part IV - Wading through the Results 98, 99, 99. Suppose further that you want to find the 90th percentile for these scores. Because the Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing data are already ordered, the next step is to multiply 90% times the total number of scores, which gives Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! 90% × 25 = 0.90 × 25 = 22.5. Rounding up to the nearest whole number, you get 23. This means that Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error counting from left to right  from the smallest to the largest number in the data set , you go until you find Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence the 23rd number in the data set. That number is 98, and it's the 90th percentile for this data set. Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence  Put all of the numbers in the data set in order from smallest to largest.  Take that result and round it up to the nearest whole number.  Multiply k percent times the total number of numbers, n.  3.  2.  4.  Intervals  HEADS UP   A high percentile doesn't always constitute a good thing. For example, if your city is at the 90th percentile in terms of crime rate compared to cities of the same size, that means that 90% of cities similar to yours have a crime rate that is lower than yours, which is not good for you.  Tip The 50th percentile is the point in the data where 50% of the data fall below that point and Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals 50% fall above that point. You may recognize this under a different name — the median. Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples Indeed, the median is a special percentile; it's the 50th percentile.

For example, U.S. Part VIII - The Part of Tens Census Bureau reported the median household income for 2001 was $42,228. The Bureau also Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey reported various percentiles for house-hold income, including the 10th, 20th, 50th, 80th, 90th, and Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes 95th.

The difference between the 50th percentile and the 20th percentile is Part IV - Wading through the Results about $25,000, whereas the spread between the 50th percentile and the 80th percentile is more like Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing $41,000.

Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence  By looking at these percentiles and how they're distributed among the data, you can tell that this data set, if shown with a histogram, would be skewed to the right.  A histogram is basically a bar chart that breaks the data into groups and shows the number in each group. See Chapter 4 for more on histograms.  That's because the higher incomes are more spread out and trail off more than low incomes, which are more clumped together. In this report, the mean wasn't shown because it would have been greatly influenced by those outliers  the households with very high incomes , which would have driven the mean upward, artificially inflating the overall description of household incomes in the United States.

Gaining the Edge: Probability Basics Probability is everywhere, yet it can be hard to understand at times, because it can seem counterintuitive. The first step in gaining the edge on probability is to understand some basic rules of probability and how these rules are applied. When statisticians talk about probability, they talk about the probability of an outcome, which is one particular result of a random process being studied. What's a random process, you ask? It's any process for which the outcome is not set in stone, but can vary in a random way. For example, if you roll a sixsided die one time, the outcome  the number on   the side facing up  will be one of six possible numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence  Every probability is a number  a percentage  between 0% and 100%.  Note that statisticians often express percentages as proportions — numbers between 0 and 1.  If an outcome has a probability of 0%, it can never happen, no matter what. If an outcome has probability of 100%, it always happens, no matter what. Most probabilities are neither 0% nor 100%, but fall somewhere in between.  The probability of an outcome is the percentage of times that the outcome is expected to happen. This can often be calculated by taking the number of ways that the outcome can happen divided by the total number of possible outcomes. For example, the probability of the number 1 appearing when a single die is rolled is 1 out of 6, or 1 6  or 16.7% .  To get the probability of obtaining one of a set of outcomes, you add up the probabilities of each outcome individually. For example, the probability of rolling an odd number  1, 3, or 5  on a single die is the sum of the probabilities of rolling a 1, a 3, and a 5:   The sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes is 1  or 100% .   = ½, or 50%.  Tip When the complement of an event is complicated, it's often easier to find the probability of the event itself, and  The complement of an event is all possible outcomes except those that make up the event. The probability of the complement of an event is 1 minus the probability of the event. For example, rolling a 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 is the complement of rolling a 6 on a single die, so the probability of rolling either a 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 is 1 minus the probability of rolling a 6, or 1 –   take 1 minus the calculated probability. Why take 1 minus this probability? Because the sum of the probabilities of all the outcomes is 1, so the probability of the complement of an event plus the probability of the event must be 1.

Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations Rolling the dice Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control Part VIII - The Part of Tens In the gambling game of craps, two dice are rolled, and the number 7 plays an important role in this game. In craps, Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey each outcome is composed of the two numbers on the dice  for example, the combination 6, 2 is one outcome . The Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes numbers on the two dice are added together to get the sum.  See Table 6-1.  The sum of 7 is the sum that happens Sources most often, and, therefore, has the highest probability of occurring. The shooter  the person rolling the dice  rolls the Index dice and whatever he she gets is called the come-out roll  for example a 6, 2 combination makes a sum of 8 for the List of Figures come-out roll . If the come-out roll sums up to 7, the shooter is done with his turn, and everyone that placed a bet List of Tables loses. If the come-out roll does not sum up to 7, the shooter keeps rolling the dice until either a sum of 7 appears or List of Sidebars the sum that showed on the come-out roll appears  in this case, 8 . Anyone around the table can bet that a sum of 7 will or won't come up before the sum of the come-out roll comes up again. And that's why everyone at the craps table gets so excited and cheers on the shooter. They're hoping that the shooter will bring them good luck and roll the combinations they're betting on.  Intervals  You can use the rules of probability listed in the preceding section to look at the outcomes of the sum of two dice and assign probabilities to them. Do you know which sum s  have the second highest probability of occurring?  When two dice are rolled, each die has six possible results; together, these six possible results on each die yield 36  6 × 6  possible combinations of two numbers, or 36 possible pairs. Because in this example, an outcome is the sum of the numbers obtained from the two rolled dice, you have eleven different possible outcomes, which range from 2  that is, 1 + 1  to 12  that is, 6 + 6 , and everything in between.

A list of all outcomes and their probabilities is called a probability model. For example, a sum of 7 can happen in 6 different ways:  1, 6 ,  2, 5 ,  3, 4 ,  4, 3 ,  5, 2 , and  6, 1 . With 36 possible combinations for the Part III - Determining the Odds two dice, the probability that the sum is 7 is 6 ÷ 36, or  .

ISBN:0764554239  1 36  HEADS UP   The probabilities for the sum of two dice were fairly straightforward to calculate. However, other probabilities can be more involved, for example the probabilities for different poker hands such as a full house, straight flush, or two pairs. What's important to remember, though, is that the ranking of the hands in poker is directly related to the probability of getting that hand; the highest hand in poker is a royal flush  10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace, all of the same suit . The reason the royal flush is the highest hand is because it's the one with the lowest probability of occurring.  Payouts in any gambling game are based on probabilities. In craps, for example, you can make side bets on what the   sum is going to be for any given roll. If you bet that on a given roll the shooter will come up with a sum of 2 and that Table of Contents actually happens, you'll win more than if you bet that on a given roll the sum of 8 will come up. Why? Because getting Statistics for Dummies a sum of 2 on two dice is much less likely to happen than getting a sum of 8 on two dice, according to Table 6-2. Introduction That's why they call it gambling.  For more on probability and gambling, see Chapter 7.

In cases when math won't work to calculate a probability, other Part IV - Wading through the Results methods can be used to estimate probabilities or to use known probabilities to make predictions about the world. For Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing example, complicated computer models are used to predict the probability of a hurricane hitting the U.S. coast, and if Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! so, when and where. These computer models are based on data from the behavior of past hurricanes, as well as Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error current weather conditions and other variables. Scientists put the information into a sophisticated mathematical model Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence that tries to predict what the hurricane will do.

Models like this would save lives, property, and millions of dollars in damage if people were able to know ahead of time what to expect and prepare accordingly. Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples Other models are based on observational data. The U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey surveyed Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test households in Columbus, Ohio, in 2001 to get an idea of the makeup of the community. One of the characteristics Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions examined was household composition  married couples, other families, people who live alone, and other non-family Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples households . The data are summarized in Figure 6-1. These statistics from a sample of households can serve as a probability model for the makeup of all households in Columbus, Ohio, in 2001.

For example, because 35% of the sampled households were married-couple households, you can say that the probability that a randomly selected household in Columbus is a married-couple household is 35%. You can also use the rules of probability to make other statements about the households in Columbus in 2001. For example, what's the probability that a randomly selected house contains any type of family? That would be the sum of the probabilities of selecting a married couple household  35%  and a household that falls into the "other family" category  20% . So, the probability that a randomly selected household in Columbus, Ohio, in 2001 contains a family is 35% + 20% = 55%.  Therefore, the probability of selecting a non-family household is 100% - 55% or 45%.    HEADS UP   The probability model in Figure 6-1 shouldn't be used for other communities outside of Columbus, Ohio, because in this survey, the sample of households was selected only from Columbus. Using these data to discuss a population other than the one from which the sample was drawn would be invalid.  See Chapter 16 for more on surveys and what they can and can't say about populations.

ISBN:0764554239  Simulations are another way to estimate probability when a formula isn't possible. In a simulation, a process is repeated over and over again under the exact same conditions  usually using a computer , and the outcomes are recorded each time. The probability of any outcome is estimated by the percentage of times the outcome occurred in the simulations. For example, a sports fan with too much time on his hands simulated thousands of NCAA   tournaments on his computer and used these simulations to predict that Duke would win the NCAA basketball Table of Contents championship in 2002 with a probability of over 95%. As luck would have it, the prediction turned out to be wrong Statistics for Dummies  Duke was eliminated early in the tournament  proving that the only thing you can be certain about is uncertainty.

Table of Contents Probability also means the percentage of times that an event will happen in the long run  over a long Statistics for Dummies period of time with repeated trials under the same conditions . So a 40% chance of rain tomorrow can Introduction be taken to mean that if you look at data from a large number of days similar to the type of day Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics tomorrow is supposed to be, it rained on 40% of those days. The baseball player's 0.291 batting Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life average can be interpreted as the proportion of times that he gets a hit averaged over many times at Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong bat  in this case he's expected to hit the ball 291 times out of 1,000 times at bat .

This section gives you some of the more common misconceptions people have about probability.  Statistics For Dummies by Deborah Rumsey  John Wiley & Sons   2003  356 pages  This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life.  With the lottery, the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 has the same chance of winning as any other combination of six numbers, even though it doesn't look like it can ever occur. This fact makes you realize that all of the other combinations are just as unlikely to be chosen as this combination is. However, if you bet on this combo and win, you probably won't have to split the winnings with anyone.  Looking more likely   If you were to write down a sequence of what you would think the outcomes of six flips of a fair coin Table of Contents  that is, a coin that hasn't been tampered with  would look like, you probably wouldn't think of writing Statistics for Dummies down something like HTTTTH  where "H" means "heads" and "T" means "tails" , because that doesn't Introduction look very "random." However, this exact sequence of heads and tails has the same chance of Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics happening as any other exact sequence. That's because the probability of getting a head is the same Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life as the probability of getting a tail on each individual toss. Now, if you were to compare the probability of Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong getting two heads  out of six tosses  with the probability of getting six heads  out of six tosses , you'd Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade get different values. The probability of getting two heads  out of six tosses  is higher because you have Part II - Number-Crunching Basics more ways of accomplishing it, instead of having to get a head every single time. Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More Part III - Determining the Odds Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win Part IV - Wading through the Results Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing Predicting long or short term Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error Probability works well for predicting long-term behavior, but it doesn't work well for predicting Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence outcomes in the short term. In the long-term, you know that unless the event has a probability of 0, it Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence will happen sometime, and depending on how big the probability is, you can even get some idea of Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals how long you can expect to wait. But you won't know exactly when the event will happen. That's what Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples makes probability so interesting and what keeps gamblers coming back over and over again. Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test For example, if I flip a fair coin six times and get six heads in a row, what do you think the outcome of Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions the next flip should be, a head or a tail? You may think I'm due to get a tail, so getting a tail now should Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples have a higher chance of happening. But in fact, the probability of getting a tail on the next flip is still 1 2, Part VII - Statistical Studies—The Inside Scoop the same as it was for each of the previous flips. You know that if the coin were flipped a large number Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls of times that you can expect about 50% of the outcomes to be heads and 50% to be tails. But you can't Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? predict when those heads or tails will appear on any given flip of the coin.  So even though it seems Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations like a tail is due, the probability of getting a head or a tail on this next flip is still 50%.  Eventually, tails Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control will start coming up, but you can't say when. Part VIII - The Part of Tens Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey Thinking 50-50 Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes Sources One common misconception is to think that every situation with two possible outcomes is a "50-50" Index situation  in other words, a 50% chance that each of the two outcomes will occur, just as it was with the List of Figures outcome of a single toss of a fair coin . Many people think that just because two outcomes are List of Tables possible, each outcome must have a one out of two chance of occurring, but that's very often not the List of Sidebars case. Not every situation is like a fair coin toss. Many situations have a higher probability of one outcome over the other.  Intervals  For example, think of a computerized "walk don't walk" sign on the crosswalk of a busy street. Is that sign going to say "walk" exactly 50% of the time? No. When the street is busy, the light will stop traffic less often, and pedestrians will have to wait longer between opportunities to cross the street. Using a sports example, think of a basketball player standing at the free throw line. Are her chances of making the basket 50-50?  After all, she either makes it or she doesn't.  Her chances are 50-50 only if her overall free throw percentage is 50% over many tries. Most likely, it's something higher than that.  Interpreting rare events   Probability can become a topic of controversy, especially in the case of rare events. A rare event has a small probability of happening, but what does that mean? It means that for any single situation or person, the event is unlikely to occur, yet if given enough repetitions of the situation over a long enough period of time or with enough people, the event is bound to happen to somebody, somewhere, sometime. This comes into play in situations where you have a cluster of people with a rare disease in one town, and you need to figure out whether something caused this to happen  the air, the water, the soil, and so on  or whether this just occurred by chance  something most people don't consider .  Statistics For Dummies by Deborah Rumsey  John Wiley & Sons   2003  356 pages  This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life.  ISBN:0764554239  Because it doesn't seem very likely that a rare event would actually occur, people naturally want to blame the occurrence on something. In some cases, they'd be right; in other cases, this is just a   Table of Contents phenomenon of random chance. Do three years in a row of rising average temperatures indicate global warming? If a dairy farm had two cows both give birth to two-headed calves in the same Statistics for Dummies season, does that mean their cows have a terrible problem? How many tire blowouts should it take to Introduction constitute a tire recall? Looking at something after the fact and saying, "What was the chance of that Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics happening here?" is different than before the fact knowing that the same event is bound to happen Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life somewhere, sometime. Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade For example, if you flip a fair coin long enough, eventually, you come across a long string of heads, Part II - Number-Crunching Basics just by chance. That's supposed to happen sometime. And because the coin was fair, you couldn't Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs blame it on anything but chance. However, the media may try to establish a pattern when they see two Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More or more occurrences of an event, such as child abductions across the country, nightclub fires, or Part III - Determining the Odds occurrences of a rare disease in the same city. I'm not saying these shouldn't be investigated for Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability possible causal problems, but I am saying that the media needs to be aware that sometimes, events Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win just happen in clumps by chance, with no big story behind it. It's also interesting to note that people Part IV - Wading through the Results view the probability of a rare event differently depending on whether the rare event is a good thing, like Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing winning the lottery  "It's got to happen to somebody, so it may as well be me!"  or a bad thing, like Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! getting struck by lightning at a golf tournament  "That's a million-to-one shot. That can never happen to me!" . This may just be human nature. Mental note: Human nature doesn't correspond to the laws Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error of probability. Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence  REMEMBER To avoid some of the more common probability misconceptions, keep the following  Intervals  in mind:  Probability isn't effective in predicting short-term behavior. It is effective when predicting long-term behavior.  If a cluster of rare events occurs somewhere, it may have happened due to chance and no other reason. Rare events are going to happen to somebody, somewhere, sometime, given enough people and time.

Connecting Probability with Statistics You may be thinking, "Probability is interesting, but what does it have to do with statistics?" Good question. It may not seem obvious, but probability and statistics fit together like a hand in a glove. Data are collected from a sample of individuals, and then statistics are calculated to summarize those data. But you don't stop there. The next step is to use these statistics to make some sort of prediction, generalization, conclusion, or decision about the population that this sample came from. That's where   probability comes in. Table of Contents Statistics for Dummies Estimating Introduction Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics Data are often collected in order to help estimate population proportions or averages. For example, Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life doctors estimate the chance of someone having a heart attack by first gathering information about a Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong patient's weight, body mass index, age, gender, genetic background, diet, exercise level, and so on. Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade Then they compare the information to data that have been collected from a sample of people who Part II - Number-Crunching Basics have similar characteristics to the patient, and they come up with the patient's probability  or risk level  Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs of having a heart attack in a given period of time. Engineers estimate the average number of cars that Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More will be using a certain section of the interstate highway during rush hour by recording traffic data using Part III - Determining the Odds technology in the pavement. After the data are collected, probability is used to determine how much Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability the sample information is likely to vary from sample to sample, day to day, hour to hour, and so on. Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win Part IV - Wading through the Results Predicting Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! Statistics are involved in helping to make predictions of all kinds — everything from weather predictions Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error and population size projections to the spread of disease or the future values of the stock market. Data Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence are collected over a period of time and are analyzed to find a model that not only fits the data well, but Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence also allows for some predictions to be made for the near future. Probability helps people using the models to assess how accurate those predictions are expected to be, given the data at hand. Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals Probability also helps scientists determine what the most likely scenario is, given the data. Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples For example, the U.S. Census Bureau makes available its population projections for the total U.S. Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test resident population. You can currently look at population projections all the way to the year 2100. In Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions 2000, the projected population for 2003 was 282,798,000, and as of May 2003, the population of the Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples United States  as shown on the U.S. Census Bureau's Web site  was already 291,065,455 and Part VII - Statistical Studies—The Inside Scoop counting. So, the projection was already off by about 8.3 million people with much of the year left, but Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls that's only 2.8% of the total population in this situation. Estimating the total population size of the Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? United States in the future is a difficult job. It's hard enough to count the number of people living here Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations right now!  By the way, according to Census Bureau, the size of the U.S. resident population projected Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control for the year 2100 is 570,954,000.  Part VIII - The Part of Tens Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey Deciding Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes Sources Many decision-making processes involve statistics and probability. Medical treatments are often Index decided in terms of the percentage of people that did well using that treatment, compared to others. List of Figures The probability that the next person will do well on a treatment would be estimated from the List of Tables percentage of other patients who did well on that treatment. Most liability forms you need to sign List of Sidebars before having surgery outline the possible side effects or complications and give some indication of how often those happen.  See Chapter 17 for more on medical studies.   Intervals  Checking quality Other decisions that involve probability occur during manufacturing processes. Many companies that manufacture items do some sort of quality control; that is, they sample products that come off of the line and assess product quality according to some set of specifications. Probability is used to decide whether and when the manufacturer needs to stop the process due to a problem with the quality of the products. Differences between the sampled product and the specifications may just be due to random variability or an unrepresentative sample; alternatively, these differences can mean that something is   wrong with the process. Stopping the process unnecessarily costs money and time, but not stopping the process when it needs to be stopped costs the company in terms of customer satisfaction with the product. So probability is used to make some pretty important decisions in the manufacturing world.  See Chapter 19 for more on quality control.

Of course that chance exists, but if everyone won big money, the casinos couldn't afford to stay in business. So they have to find ways to Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals take your money, and they do that by setting game rules that give them a tiny edge during each round Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples of play; by making sure that when someone does win, he or she wins big  so word gets around ; and Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test by encouraging you to stay in the casinos as long as possible.

The most important thing to remember in any gaming Part VIII - The Part of Tens situation  gaming is the casino industry's softer word for gambling  is to quit while you're ahead. If Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey everyone did that, the casinos would be out of business. But of course, that won't happen because Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes quitting while you're ahead is hard to do. Sources Index On the other side of the coin, another good strategy is to cut your losses and quit before you lose too much, instead of figuring that the odds will eventually turn back in your favor, and you'll win all your List of Figures money back. That approach often turns out to be a lose-lose situation. Casinos bet that you will stay List of Tables and play no matter what, increasing their chances of eventually getting more and more of your money.

Intervals  REMEMBER What can you do to minimize your chance of losing, or of losing too much? Set up some boundaries for yourself before you even walk into the gaming situation  for example, quit playing when you're ahead or down by a certain amount , and then stick with those boundaries. When gambling  excuse me — gaming , quit while you're ahead or before you get too far behind. Set your limits before you start.            Knowing a Little Probability Helps a Lotto Two of the most important tools you can use in any gaming situation are information about your chances of winning and a true understanding of what those chances mean. Probability can certainly go against your intuition, and you don't want to let your intuition get in the way of keeping your money.  See Chapter 6 for a more in-depth discussion of the use of probability in statistics.

Any situation that has only two possible outcomes is a 50-50 situation  50% chance of winning, 50% chance of losing .  A combination of lottery numbers like 1-2-3-4-5-6 can never win; those numbers aren't random enough.  If Joe and Sue have three girls already, the chance that they will have a boy next time has to be pretty good.  Buying 100 lottery tickets instead of just one is a great idea; it gives you such a better chance of winning.

Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! This may ruin some of the magic and excitement that comes with gaming, but then again, it probably Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error explains why you can't find statisticians  certainly none that I know  who are either professional or compulsive gamblers.

Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals Having a 50-50 chance Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions You're going to flip a fair coin  that is, a coin that hasn't been tampered with ; it has heads on one side, Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples tails on the other. What's the chance that a head will come up? Fifty percent. What's the chance that a Part VII - Statistical Studies—The Inside Scoop tail will come up? Fifty percent. If you were to bet on the outcome of this coin flip, you would have a 50- Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls 50 chance of winning  versus losing . Why is that? Because you have two possible outcomes, heads Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? and tails, and each of these outcomes has an equal chance of occurring. You know a couple that is going to have a baby. They, of course, can have either a boy or a girl. Each of these outcomes is Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations equally likely, so the couple's chances of having a girl  versus a boy  is 50-50. On the other hand, if Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control you buy one of 1,000 raffle tickets for a motorcycle, you have two possible outcomes, win or lose the Part VIII - The Part of Tens motorcycle. Does that mean that your chance of winning is 50-50? No. Why not? Because you aren't Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey the only person who bought a ticket! Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes Sources Four rules of probability may help break these ideas down a bit: Index List of Figures List of Tables List of Sidebars  The probability that a certain outcome will happen is the percentage of times that the outcome is expected to happen in the long term, if the exact same conditions were repeated over and over.  Intervals  Any probability is a number between 0 and 1. A probability of 0 means that the outcome is not even possible. A probability of 1 means that the outcome is certain.  All of the probabilities for all possible outcomes must add up to 1. That means the probability that an outcome does not happen equals 1 minus the probability that the outcome does happen.  The probability of an event  a combination of outcomes  is equal to the sum of the probabilities of the individual outcomes that make up the event.  With the coin flip, two outcomes are possible, head or tail. The number of ways a head can occur is 1, and the number of ways a tail can occur is 1. The total number of possible outcomes is 2: head or tail. So, in that case, the chance of a head coming up is ½ or 50%; the same is true for a tail. This is a 50-   50 situation.  ISBN:0764554239  Statistics For Dummies by Deborah Rumsey  John Wiley & Sons   2003  356 pages  This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life.  However, if you look carefully at the first rule, this explains why not everything with two outcomes has a 50-50 chance of happening. You have to look at the number of ways that each of the outcomes can happen. With your motorcycle raffle ticket, you can either win or lose. The number of ways you can win is 1, because the raffle organizers will draw only 1 winning ticket. The number of ways you can lose is 999 because all of the remaining tickets are losers. The total number of outcomes is 1,000. That means your chance of winning is 1 ÷ 1,000 = 0.001, and your chance of losing is 999 ÷ 1,000 = 0.999. Certainly, you have only two possible outcomes regarding your raffle ticket  win or lose , but each of these outcomes does not have an equal chance of happening, so this is definitely not a 50-50   Table of Contents situation. Statistics for Dummies HEADS Very few probabilities in life are actually 50-50.

Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade Picking winning numbers Part II - Number-Crunching Basics Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs So, you're ready to play the Powerball lottery. You've heard that the jackpot is now up to $200 million Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More — you may buy more tickets than usual this time to increase your chances of winning. And you're Part III - Determining the Odds ready to pick those numbers.  You have to pick five different numbers between 1 and 53, and then you Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability pick a separate Powerball number between 1 and 42, and this one can be the same as one of the Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win other five that you already chose.  To win the big jackpot, you need to correctly pick  in any order  all Part IV - Wading through the Results of the first five numbers, plus the correct Powerball number. What combination should you pick? Your Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing brother's football number, your mom's birthday, four digits from your Social Security number, your Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! dog's age in months, and the number you saw in your dream last night? These options sound as good Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error as anything else, because any combination that you choose is just as likely to win as any other Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence combination. Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence This makes good sense until you start thinking about the combination 1-2-3-4-5 with a Powerball Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals number of 6. It seems like this combination should never happen because these numbers don't seem Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples random enough. Well, this is a case in which your intuition can get the best of you. Indeed, this combination has the same chance of being chosen as any other combination that can occur. Take a Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test small example in which the possible numbers to choose from are 1, 2, 3, 4, and you have to pick 2 Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions numbers. The six possible outcomes are 1-2; 1-3; 1-4; 2-3; 2-4; 3-4. Your chance of winning is 1 out of Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples 6. Notice that the combination 1-2 has the same chance of being chosen as any other combination. Part VII - Statistical Studies—The Inside Scoop The same is true for the combination 1-2-3-4-5 with a Powerball of 6. Combinations like 23-16-05-24- Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls 18 with a Powerball of 12 may look easier to get, but remember that you have to get every single Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? number exactly right in order to win the big jackpot.

What this combination should make you realize is how small the chance of winning the jackpot really is.  The actual chances of winning the jackpot with a Powerball such as the one described above are 1 in 120,526,770.   Lotteries typically call the probability of winning the odds of winning, and in this case, these two terms are taken to mean the same thing. However, the way payouts and odds are presented in sports betting  horse races, football games, boxing, and so on  is different from what's described here, and that more complex form of betting odds is beyond the scope of this book.  HEADS UP   Intervals  Buying lottery tickets — less can be more A Powerball lottery ticket only costs a dollar, and it gives you a chance to win a multi-million dollar jackpot. You figure that someone has to eventually win that jackpot, so you decide you're going to take your shot at it. After all, if you don't play, you can't win. As long as you truly understand your chances of winning and losing, buying a few lottery tickets now and then can be cheap fun.  The problem, however, comes when people buy lots of tickets, thinking that their odds are greatly   ISBN:0764554239  increased by buying more tickets. While holding a hundred tickets  versus only one ticket  does increase your chance of winning a hundred times, you have to realize that the chances of winning big are very small — almost zero. And a hundred times a number that's close to zero is still very close to zero. If you can't afford to lose that hundred dollars  and the odds are overwhelming that you will lose it , don't bet it all on the lottery.  Statistics For Dummies by Deborah Rumsey  John Wiley & Sons   2003  356 pages  This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life.  To put the probability of winning the Powerball jackpot into perspective, look at Figure 7-1. This shows the prizes and the chances of winning each prize in a given Powerball lottery.  Most Powerball lotteries offer the same payouts with the same odds.  The gray circles indicate the five balls chosen from 1 to 53 and the black circle indicates the Powerball number. The odds of winning the $3 prize are 1 in 70,   Table of Contents or 0.0142  about 1.5% . Note that this is more like a probability than real odds, but I'll let it slide. As you go up the scale, the winnings increase, but your odds of winning decrease, and they do so Statistics for Dummies exponentially. Matching 4 of the 5 numbers, for example, has odds of 1 in about 12,000; matching 5 of Introduction the 5 numbers has odds of 1 in about 3 million; and finally, matching all 5 numbers plus the Powerball Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics number, decreases your odds to one in over 120 million.

A small example may help illustrate this. Suppose you have to pick 2 numbers between 0 and 9. If you have to match only one number, your chances are 1 in 10. If you have to match both numbers, your chances drop to 1 in 45. This is because you have 10 possibilities for the first number, times 9 possibilities for the second number  because no repeats are allowed , for a total of 90 possibilities. But now you have to divide those 90 possibilities by 2, because you can have the numbers in either order and still win.  You don't want to count 1-0 and 0-1 as separate combinations, for example.  The odds change dramatically because of this multiplier effect. Having to match the Powerball number in addition to having to match the first five numbers multiplies the odds by an additional 42 times  because you have 42 possible numbers for the Powerball .  The overall chance of winning any prize  not just the big prize  is reported by the lottery to be 1 in 36. Because the overall chance of winning is the same as the chance of winning any prize, add up all the probabilities of the prizes, and you get 1 in 36. You're using the fourth rule of probability here  see the "Having a 50-50 chance" section earlier in this chapter .   REMEMBER Before you play any game of chance, always look at the odds or probability of winning. And don't spend more money than you can easily afford to lose.

The chance is still 50-50. Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence  Probabilities work only in predicting long-term behavior, not short-term behavior. If you know that the chance of heads is 50%, that means if you flip the coin many times, you should expect about half of the outcomes to be heads and half to be tails. However, you can't predict when those heads and tails will appear at any given moment. They don't Intervals even themselves out as they go along; they only approach their actual probabilities in the long term. This phenomenon is called the law of averages, which is further defined in the following section. Many people use this term to explain why winning or losing streaks end, even when these so-called streaks don't even exist.

Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey Some say the tightest ones are by the blackjack tables because people don't want to be distracted too Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes much by the beeping noise. Casino owners never tell their secrets, so no one can tell for sure, but one Sources thing is certain: Slot machines can take your money very quickly. No skill is needed, and each pull of Index the handle takes only a few seconds to spend anywhere from five cents  in my case  to thousands of List of Figures dollars  in the high-dollar slot areas of some casinos . All of that spending and pulling is done in List of Tables pursuit of the big jackpot that may come on your very next spin. List of Sidebars One of the most common misconceptions about slot machines is that the longer you play them, the greater your chances of winning. This is something that the casinos are betting on. In fact, just the opposite is true, because of the law of averages. The law of averages says that in the long run, averages will be close to their expected value. In statistical terms, the expected value is a weighted average of the outcomes based on their probabilities.  With any casino game, the house has a slightly higher chance of winning any single round. This means in the long run, you should expect to lose a small amount with a very high chance every single time, and you should expect to win a large amount with a tiny chance every single time. The casino sets their odds and payouts so that, in the long term, everything averages out in their favor, even taking the big jackpots into account.   What this means for you is that you'll end up with a small negative expected value every time you play. And the more you play, the more money you have to expect to lose in the long term, because your overall expected value is the sum of the expected values for each time you play; and each one of Statistics For Dummies those expected values is a negative number.

Chapter 8: Measures of Relative Standing The only way to really be able to interpret statistical results is to have something to compare them to, so that you can put the results into some type of perspective. For example, suppose a hypothetical physical therapy student named Rhodie takes a standardized test for physical therapy certification and gets a score of 235. What does 235 mean in this case? Nothing, if that's all you have to go on. You need to be able to put this score into some perspective by determining where it stands relative to the   other scores on the test. Is a light bulb that lasts more than 1,200 hours a freak of nature or just a Table of Contents standard light bulb? You can't tell without knowing how long most light bulbs last.

It depends on how his Introduction average score compares to the other average scores in his class  and how nice his professor is! . Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life In this chapter, you discover how to find and interpret the relative standing of individual results; the goal Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong here is to describe where an individual stands, relative to all of the other individuals in the population. In Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade Chapters 9 and 10, I discuss how to find and interpret the relative standing of the results from a Part II - Number-Crunching Basics sample  for example, the sample mean or the sample proportion . The goal in that case is to Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs determine where your sample mean or sample proportion stands, compared to the population of all Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More possible values of the sample mean or sample proportion. Part III - Determining the Odds Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability Straightening Out the Bell Curve Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win Part IV - Wading through the Results The first step in determining where a particular result stands is to get a listing or picture of all of the Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing possible values that the variable can take on in the population and how often those values occur; this is Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! called a distribution. Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error Many different types of distributions are possible. For example grades for one class  call them Mr. Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence Average's class  are distributed uniformly, with an equal number of scores in each grouping  see the Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence top portion of Figure 8-1  while grades from another class  call them Mr. Mean's class  are distributed in a polarized way, with everyone getting either a very high or a very low score  as in the bottom portion Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals of Figure 8-1 .  Most distributions tend to fall somewhere in between.

This basically means you Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples have a big group of individuals near the middle of the distribution, with fewer and fewer individuals Part VII - Statistical Studies—The Inside Scoop trailing off as you move farther and farther away from the middle in either direction. Many variables in Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls the real world  for example, standardized test scores, lifetimes of products, heights, weights, and so Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? on  have distributions that look like a bell-shaped curve.

The lifetimes of the light bulbs shown in Figure 8-2 have a Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! normal distribution with a mean  and median  of 1,000 hours.

The variability in the values is also extremely important, even though much of the media Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test ignores this characteristic and typically reports only the mean. Referring to Figure 8-2, you can see that Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions the bulk of the light bulbs from Lights Out has a range of lifetimes that vary from under 700 hours to Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples over 1,300 hours, with a good many of the bulbs lasting between 900 and 1,100 hours. As a Part VII - Statistical Studies—The Inside Scoop consumer, do you want that much variability in lifetimes when you buy a package of light bulbs? Maybe Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls not. A competing company  call them Lights Up  is going to try to produce light bulbs with less Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? variability; the lifetime of their light bulbs will still have a mean of 1,000 hours, but this company is able Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations to produce bulbs with more consistent lifetimes, ranging from around 940 to 1,060 hours, with a good Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control many of their light bulbs lasting between 980 and 1,020 hours  see Figure 8-3 .

Variability in a distribution is measured and marked off in terms of number of standard deviations.  See Chapter 3 for the formula for standard deviation.  On a normal distribution, the standard deviation has a special significance because it's the distance from the mean to a place on the distribution called the saddle point. Each normal distribution has two saddle points; each is the same distance from the mean. To find a saddle point, start at the mean and move either right or left until the curvature   changes from being an upside-down bowl  concave down  to a right-side-up bowl  concave up .  ISBN:0764554239  HEADS UP   In Figures 8-2 and 8-3, the saddle points are marked with dots. The standard deviation of the light bulb lifetimes from Lights Out  refer to Figure 8-2  is 100 hours. The standard deviation of the more consistent light bulbs from Lights Up  see Figure 8-3  is 20 hours.  For more information on standard deviation, see Chapter 5.   Statistics For Dummies by Deborah Rumsey  John Wiley & Sons   2003  356 pages  This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life.  Before examining any results, be sure to both examine the scale on the horizontal axis of any distribution and know what the standard deviation is. Depending on the scale used, a distribution can look more squeezed together or more spread out than it should. Figures 8-2 and 8-3, for example, look similar, but their scales are very different. A better way to compare the light bulb lifetimes of the two companies is to put them on the same scale, as shown in Figure 8-4. Now you can see how much more spread out the lifetimes are for the bulbs made by Lights Out compared to those made by Lights Up; the lifetimes of the bulbs made by Lights Up are much more concentrated around the mean.

Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence Looking for most of the values: The empirical rule Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples As long as a distribution has a mound shape in the middle — and the normal distribution certainly fits Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test that criterion — you can make some general statements about where most of the values will be, using Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions distances of 1, 2, or 3 standard deviations from the mean to mark off certain milestones. The rule that Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples allows you to do this is called the empirical rule. Part VII - Statistical Studies—The Inside Scoop Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls The empirical rule says that if a distribution has a mound shape, then: Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? About 68% of the values lie within 1 standard deviation of the mean  or between the mean minus 1 Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations times the standard deviation, and the mean plus 1 times the standard deviation . In statistical Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control notation, this is represented as: µ ± s . Part VIII - The Part of Tens Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes Sources Index List of Figures List of Tables List of Sidebars  About 95% of the values lie within 2 standard deviations of the mean  or between the mean minus 2 times the standard deviation, and the mean plus 2 times the standard deviation . The statistical notation for this is: µ ± 2s .  About 99%  actually, 99.7%  of the values lie within 3 standard deviations of the mean  or between the mean minus 3 times the standard deviation and the mean plus 3 times the standard deviation . Statisticians use the following notation to represent this: µ ± 3s . TECHNICAL STUFF   In the formulas for the empirical rule, if you don't know the population mean and standard deviation, estimate  replace  the population standard deviation, s , with the sample standard deviation, s. And you can also estimate  replace  the population mean, µ, with the sample mean, x. See Chapter 3 for details.  Figure 8-4: Variability in light bulb lifetimes for Lights Out versus Lights Up.  Intervals  Figure 8-5 illustrates the empirical rule. The reason that 68% of the values lie within 1 standard deviation of the mean is because the majority of the values on a normal distribution are mounded up in the middle, close to the mean  as Figure 8-5 shows . Remember, it has a bell shape. Moving out 1 more standard deviation on either side of the mean adds more values, but less than 30% more  for a total of 95% of the values  because now you're picking up less of the mound part and more of the tail part. Finally, going out 1 more standard deviation on either side of the mean gets you that last little bit   of the tail areas, picking up 4.7%  nearly all of the rest  of the remaining values, to go from 95% to 99.7% of the data. Most researchers stay with the 95% range for reporting their results, because going out 3 standard deviations on either side of the mean doesn't seem worthwhile, just to pick up that last 4.7% of the values.

Using the empirical rule, you can discuss the relative standing of certain List of Sidebars milestones in the data. For example, according to this model, about 68% of the light bulbs are expected to last between 900 and 1,100 hours  1,000 ± 100 , about 95% of the light bulbs should last between 800 and 1,200 hours  1,000 ± 2 × 100 , and 99.7% of the light bulbs should last between 700 and 1,300 hours.  I need to stress the word about in the preceding description of the empirical rule. These results are approximations only  but they're good approximations . Later in this chapter  see the "Converting to a Standard Score" section , you see how to give more precise information regarding what percent of the values in the distribution are between, above, or below certain values. However, the empirical rule is an important rule in statistics, and the concept of "going out two standard deviations gets you about 95% of the values" is one that you see mentioned often throughout this book.

Tip You can use the symmetry of the normal distribution in combination with the empirical rule to answer other questions about the light bulb lifetimes. For example, what percentage of light bulbs should last 1,000 hours or more? The answer is 50%, because the median is at 1,000, and half of the values are greater than the median. What percentage of light bulbs from Lights Out should last more than 1,200 hours  refer to Figure 8-2 ? The answer is 2.5%. Why? Because 95% of the light bulbs have lifetimes that are between 800 and 1,200 hours, and given that the total percentage under the whole curve has to be 100%, the remaining two tail areas must add up to 5%. Light bulbs lasting more than 1,200 hours make up the right tail only, and because of symmetry, you cut that 5% exactly in half to get 2.5%. So a light bulb that lasts more than 1,200 hours is pretty much a freak of nature, because that happens only 2.5% of the time  at least with Lights Out . With Lights Up  refer to Figure 8-3 , a light bulb lasting that long would be unheard of, because 1,200 is much more than 3 standard deviations above the mean for the bulbs produced by that company  refer to Figure 8-4 .    Table of Contents Statistics for Dummies Introduction Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life The moral of the story here is that if you like to gamble, buy your light bulbs from Lights Out, because Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong you'll have a greater chance of getting either a very long-lasting bulb or a bulb that lasts for a very Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade short time; in other words, the bulbs from Lights Out have more variability in their expected Part II - Number-Crunching Basics performance.

Converting to a Standard Score Suppose that hypothetical physical therapy student Rhodie took a standardized test for certification to become a physical therapist, and her results indicated that she got a score of 235. All you know is that the scores for this test had a normal distribution. Is Rhodie's score a good one, a bad one, or is it just a middle-of-the-road result? You can't answer this question without a measure of where Rhodie stands among the other people who took the test. In other words, you need to determine the relative standing   of Rhodie's test score on the distribution of all the scores. Table of Contents Statistics for Dummies Focusing on the standard deviation Introduction Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics You can determine the relative standing for Rhodie's test score in a number of ways — some better Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life than others. First you can look at the score in terms of the total points possible, which for this test turns Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong out to be 300. This doesn't compare her score to anyone else's, it just compares her score to the Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade possible maximum.

A standard Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? score is a standardized version of the original score; it represents the number of standard deviations Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations above or below the mean. The formula for calculating a standard score is the following: Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control Part VIII - The Part of Tens Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes Sources To convert an original score to a standard score: Index 1. List of Figures List of Tables List of Sidebars  Find the mean and the standard deviation of the population that you're working with.  For example, you can convert Rhodie's exam score of 235 to a standard score under each of the two scenarios discussed in the preceding section. In the first scenario, the mean is 250 and the standard deviation is 5, so Step 1 is done.  Standard score =  original score -  mean  ÷ standard deviation. Or, using  shorthand notation,   2.  3.  Take the original score, and subtract the mean. In Rhodie's first scenario, you find the actual distance from the mean by taking 235 -  250 = - 15  which means her score is fifteen points below the mean . Divide your result by the standard deviation. In Rhodie's case, the distance is - 15. Converting this distance in terms of number of standard deviations means taking - 15 ÷ 5 = - 3, which is Rhodie's standard score. In the first scenario   3.   standard deviation = 5 , Rhodie's score of 235 is 3 standard deviations below the mean. In the second scenario  standard deviation = 15 , Rhodie's standard score is  235 -  250  ÷ 15 = - 15 ÷ 15 = - 1. So her score is 1 standard deviation below the mean in the second scenario.  Statistics For Dummies by Deborah Rumsey  To avoid errors in converting to standard scores, be sure to do Steps 2 and 3 in the John Wiley & Sons   2003  356 pages  order given.

A positive standard score means the original score was above the mean.  A negative standard score means the original score was below the mean.  Properties of standard scores   Table of Contents The following properties may prove helpful when interpreting standard scores: Statistics for Dummies Introduction Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade Part II - Number-Crunching Basics Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More Part III - Determining the Odds Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win Part IV - Wading through the Results Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary!

Intervals  Scores that come from a normal distribution, when standardized, have a special normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. This distribution is called the standard normal distribution  see Figure 8-8 .  Figure 8-8: The standard normal distribution.

If someone gives you a standard score, you can interpret it right away. For example, a standard score of +2 says that this score is 2 standard deviations above the mean. To interpret a standard score, you don't need to know what the original score was or what the mean and standard deviation were. The standard score gives you the relative standing of that value, which, in most cases, is what matters most.  Converting to standard scores doesn't change the relative standing of any of the values on the distribution; it simply changes the units.  This is analogous to changing the units of temperature when converting from the Fahrenheit scale to the Celsius scale. The temperature outside doesn't change, but the units used to measure that temperature do.  Subtracting the mean from the original score centers everything at 0. If the original score falls directly on the mean, it will be converted to a standard score of 0. The tick marks on either side of the mean are still each in terms of the original standard deviation  which can go by 5s, 15s, and so on . For standard scores, you want them to be in units of 1, instead, for ease of interpretation. That means after you subtract the mean, you must divide your result by the standard deviation.  This is similar to changing from inches to feet by dividing by 12.   Comparing apples and oranges using standard scores One common use for standard scores is to compare scores from different distributions that would   ISBN:0764554239  otherwise not be comparable. For example, suppose Bill applies to two different colleges  call them Data University and Ohio Stat , and he has to take a math placement test for each of the colleges. The tests are totally different  they even had a different number of questions  and when Bob gets his Statistics For Dummies scores back, he wants to be able to compare his scores and determine which college gives him a by Deborah Rumsey  better relative standing on its math placement test. John Wiley & Sons   2003  356 pages  This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life.  Data University tells Bob that his score is 60 and that the distribution of all scores is normal with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 5. Ohio Stat tells Bob that his score is 90 and that the scores have a normal distribution with mean 80 and standard deviation 10. On which test does Bob perform better? You can't compare the 50 to the 90 outright, because they're on totally different scales. And   Table of Contents you can't say that he performed the same on each just because he was 10 points above the average on each one. Here, the standard deviation is an important factor. The way to make a fair and equitable Statistics for Dummies comparison of these scores is to convert each of them to standard scores, allowing them to both be on Introduction the same scale  where most of the values lie between - 3 and +3 with units of 1 . Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life Again, Bob's score on Data University's placement exam is 60 with a mean of 50 and standard Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong deviation of 5 for the population of all test scores. His standard score, therefore, is  60 -  50  ÷ 5 = 10 Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade ÷ 5 = +2, meaning his relative standing on Data University's placement exam is 2 standard deviations Part II - Number-Crunching Basics above the mean. His score on Ohio Stat's placement test is 90, where the mean is 80 and the Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs standard deviation is 10. His standard score, therefore, is  90 -  80  ÷ 10 = 10 ÷ 10 = +1, meaning Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More Bob's relative standing on Ohio Stat's math placement exam is 1 standard deviation above the mean.

Sizing Up Results Using Percentiles Percentiles are used in a variety of ways for comparison purposes and to determine relative standing. Babies' weights, lengths, and head circumferences are reported and interpreted in terms of percentiles, for example. Percentiles are also used by companies to get a handle on where they stand in terms of the competition on sales, profits, customer satisfaction, and so on.  For the details on percentiles, see Chapter 5.  And the relationship between percentiles and standard scores is an   important one, as the next example shows.

Chapter 9: Caution—Sample Results Vary! Statistics are often presented as one-shot deals. For example, "One out of every two marriages ends in divorce", "Four out of five dentists surveyed recommend Trident gum", or "The average lifespan of a female born in the year 2000 is 80 years." People hear statistics like this and assume that those results apply to them. The ordinary person may assume, for example, that his chance of getting divorced is 50%, that his dentist probably recommends Trident gum, and that if he and his wife  if they haven't   divorced yet!  had a baby girl in the year 2000, they can expect her to live to be 80 years old. Table of Contents Statistics for Dummies But shouldn't these statistics come with a "plus or minus" indicating that the results vary? You bet! Introduction Does it happen? Not often enough. The truth is that unless the researchers are able to conduct a Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics census to get their results  collecting data on every single member of the population , those results are Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life going to vary from sample to sample, and that variability can be much more than you think! The Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong question is, by how much should you expect a statistical result to vary? You hope  perhaps even Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade automatically assume  that it shouldn't vary by much, and that you can accurately apply the reported Part II - Number-Crunching Basics result to almost anyone. But is this always the case? Absolutely not; the variability in any statistical Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs result depends on a number of factors, all of which are discussed in this chapter. Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More Part III - Determining the Odds Expecting Sample Results to Vary Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win I was watching a commercial on TV the other day for a weight-loss meal-replacement drink. It gave an Part IV - Wading through the Results inspiring story about a woman who had lost 50 pounds in 6 months  and who had kept off the weight Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing for over a year . During her testimony, a message flashed for a couple of seconds at the bottom of the Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! screen that said "results not typical." Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error That leads to the question, "What's typical?" How much weight can you expect to lose in 6 months on Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence this product, or, if you wanted to lose 50 pounds, how long should you expect it to take? You know that Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence no matter what the results are for any individual, results are expected to vary from person to person. But this commercial is trying to lead you to believe that you should expect to lose about 50 pounds in 6 Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals months  even though the tiny message says you shouldn't . What would be nice is if this manufacturer Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples told you by how much you should expect those results to vary. What would also be nice is if the Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test commercial presented the results from a sample of people, not just from one person. Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples Part VII - Statistical Studies—The Inside Scoop Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? Suppose you're trying to estimate the proportion of people in the United States who approve of the Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations president. If you ask a random sample of 1,000 people from the United States whether they approve of Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control how the president is doing his job, you'll get one sample result  for example, 55% approve . You shouldn't report that 55% of the entire population of the United States approves of the president, Part VIII - The Part of Tens because your result is based on one sample of only 1,000 people. Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes If you take a different random sample of 1,000 people from the same population and ask the same Sources question, you'll likely get a different result. In fact, given that the population of the United States is so Index large and not everyone shares the same opinion of the president, 100 different random samples of List of Figures 1,000 people — each taken from the same population and each asked the same question — would List of Tables yield 100 different results. So how do you report your sample results? Some measure of how much List of Sidebars the results are expected to vary has to be part of the package.  Anecdotes  individual stories and testimonies  are eye catching, but they're not statistically meaningful!  HEADS UP   Intervals  HEADS UP   Expect sample results to vary from sample to sample. Don't take a statistic at face value and try to apply it without having some indication of how much that result is expected to vary.

Measuring Variability in Sample Results You may be wondering how you can assess the amount by which a sample statistic is going to vary without having to select every possible sample and look at its statistic. You may as well do a census at that point, right? Fortunately, thanks to some major statistical results  mainly the central limit theorem , you can find out how much you expect sample means or proportions to vary without having to take all possible samples  what a relief! . The central limit theorem, in a nutshell, says that the distribution of all   sample means  or proportions  is normal, as long as the sample sizes are large enough. And even Table of Contents more impressive, the central limit theorem doesn't care what the distribution of the original population Statistics for Dummies looks like. How can this be? You need to take a large enough sample, and you need to know some of Introduction the characteristics of your original population  like the mean and the standard deviation . And then the Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics magic of statistical theory takes over from there. Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong Standard errors Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade Part II - Number-Crunching Basics Variability in sample means  or proportions  is measured in terms of standard errors. Standard error is Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs the same basic concept as standard deviation; both represent a typical distance from the mean. But Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More here is how standard error differs from standard deviation. The original population values deviate from Part III - Determining the Odds each other due to natural phenomena  people have different heights, weights, and so on , hence the Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability name standard deviation to measure their variability. Sample means vary because of the error that Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win occurs in not doing a census and being able to only take samples, hence the name standard error to Part IV - Wading through the Results measure the variability of the sample means.  See Chapter 5 for more on the standard deviation. I talk Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing more about how to interpret standard errors in this section. For specifics on standard error formulas, Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! see Chapter 10.  Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error Here's an example: The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics tries to track what people spend their money Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence on each year with a Consumer Expenditure Survey  CES . The bureau takes a sample of households Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence and asks each household in the sample to give their spending information.  Bias in reporting could be an issue here.  Their typical sample size is 7,500 people. Table 9-1 shows a few of the results from the Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals 2001 CES. This table not only includes the average amount of money spent by people in the sample Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples on various items  the sample means for each item , it also includes the standard error for each of Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test those sample means. Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples Table 9-1: Average Yearly Household Expenses for American Households in 2001 Part VII - Statistical Studies—The Inside Scoop Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls Expense Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results?

For example, notice that about 42% of all average household food expenses are for eating out, given that $2,235.37 ÷  $3,085.52 + $2,235.37  = $2,235.37 ÷ $5,320.89 = 0.42 or 42%. The standard errors for average food expenses are larger than for the other expenses on the list, because food expenses vary a lot more from household to household. However, you may wonder why the standard errors for food expenses   aren't larger than what's shown in Table 9-1. Remember, standard error tells you how much variability you can expect in the average if you were to take another sample. If the sample size is large, the average shouldn't change by much. And you know that the government never uses small sample sizes!  Statistics For Dummies by Deborah Rumsey  John Wiley & Sons   2003  356 pages  This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life.  A listing of the standard errors for sample means is not something you would typically see in a media report. However, you can  and should, when the results are important to you  dig deeper and find the standard errors, as well. The best thing to do is to look up the research articles and look for the standard errors in those articles.  HEADS UP   ISBN:0764554239  Intervals  TECHNICAL STUFF   According to the central limit theorem, if the samples are large enough, the distribution of all possible sample means will have a bell-shaped, or normal distribution with the same mean as that of the original population.  See Chapter 3 for more on the normal distribution.  This is because the sample means are clustered near the overall average value, which is the population mean. High values in a sample are offset by low values that also appear in the sample, in an averaging out effect. The variability in the sampling distribution is measured in terms of standard errors. An added benefit to using an average to get an estimate  rather than a total or a single value  is that the variability in the sample means decreases as sample sizes get larger.  Similar characteristics also apply to the sampling distribution of the sample proportion, in the case of categorical [yes no] data from surveys and polls.     Sampling distributions Table of Contents Statistics for Dummies Introduction A listing of all the values that a sample mean can take on and how often those values can occur is Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics called the sampling distribution of the sample mean. A sampling distribution, like any other distribution, Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life has a shape, a center, and a measure of variability  in this case, the standard error .  See Chapter 4 Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong for information on shape, center, and variability; see Chapter 3 for more information on distributions.  Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade Part II - Number-Crunching Basics Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More Part III - Determining the Odds Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win Part IV - Wading through the Results Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence Using the empirical rule to interpret standard errors Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals Because the sampling distribution of sample means  or sample proportions  is normal  mound- Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples shaped , you can use the empirical rule to get an idea of how much a given sample result is expected Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test to vary, provided that the sample size is large enough.  See Chapter 8 for full coverage of the Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions empirical rule.  Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples Part VII - Statistical Studies—The Inside Scoop Applied to sample means and proportions, the empirical rule says that you can expect: Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control Part VIII - The Part of Tens Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes Sources Index HEADS List of Figures UP  List of Tables List of Sidebars  What does the empirical rule tell you about how much you can expect a given sample mean to vary? Keep in mind that 95% of the sample means should lie within 2 standard errors of the population mean, and your job is to estimate the population mean. So, if your estimate is actually a range including your sample mean plus or minus 2 standard errors, your estimate would be correct about 95% of the time.  The number of standard errors added or subtracted is called the margin of error. For more on the margin of error, see Chapter 10.   Similar values for categorical  yes no  data: 68%, 95%, or 99.7% of the sample proportions will lie within 1, 2, or 3 standard errors, respectively, of the population proportion  About 99.7% of the sample means to lie within 3 standard errors of the population mean  About 95% of the sample means to lie within 2 standard errors of the population mean  About 68% of the sample means to lie within 1 standard error of the population mean  Consider this example: According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average household in 2001 contained 2.5 people  0.7 of which were children under 18, and 0.3 of which were people over 65  and 1.9 vehicles.  Sorry, no standard errors were available for these data.  Referring to Table 9-1, the average phone expenses for the year for this sample of 7,500 households was $914.41 per household. How much are these results expected to vary from sample to sample  that is, if different samples of 7,500 households each had been selected from the same population ? The standard error for phone expenses for this sample is $9.69. This means that 95% of the sample average phone   expenses should lie within 2 × $9.69  or $19.38  on either side of the actual population average. This shows how much the mean phone expenses are expected to vary when the sample size is 7,500.  HEADS UP   In the preceding example, you're not saying that 95% of all the households in the population have phone expenses in that range. Instead, you're giving an estimate for what the average phone expense is, over all households in the population. The average phone expense would actually be a single number. But because you can't get the actual number, you estimate it using this range of values.

ISBN:0764554239  HEADS UP   Reporting the margin of error for the sample mean is something that you don't see very often in media reports involving quantitative data  such as household income, house prices, or stock market values . Yet the margin of error should always be there in order for the public to assess the accuracy of the results! With survey and polling data  which are categorical data and are reported as proportions  you're often given the margin of error, which is directly related to the standard error  see Chapter 10 . Why the double standard? I can't say for sure. Intervals  You can also use the empirical rule to give a rough estimate of the average telephone expenses for all   U.S. households  not just the sample of 7,500 people . Again, using the second property of the Table of Contents empirical rule, you would expect that the average telephone expense for all households in the U.S. is Statistics for Dummies about $914.41, plus or minus 2 × $9.69 = $19.38. This type of estimate will be correct for 95% of the Introduction samples selected  and you hope that the sample collected in the Consumer Expenditure Survey is one Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics of them . Using proper statistical jargon, this means that you can estimate with about 95% confidence Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life that the average phone expenses per year for all U.S. households lies somewhere between $914.41 Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong - $19.38 and $914.41 + $19.38, or between $895.03 and $933.79. If you want to be about 99.7% Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade confident in your estimate  instead of 95% confident , you need to add and subtract 3 standard errors. Part II - Number-Crunching Basics Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs This type of result, involving a statistic plus or minus a certain number of standard errors, is called a Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More confidence interval.  For more on this see Chapter 11.  The amount added or subtracted is called the Part III - Determining the Odds margin of error.

These results are actually due to the central limit theorem  CLT . Statisticians love Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples the CLT; without it, they wouldn't have jobs. The CLT allows them to actually say something about Part VII - Statistical Studies—The Inside Scoop where they expect sample results to lie, without having to look at all possible samples drawn from a Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls particular population. It also provides a formula for calculating standard errors, as well as more Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? specific information regarding what percentage of the sample means  or proportions  will lie between Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations any number of standard errors  not just 1, 2, or 3 . Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control The central limit theorem says that for any population with mean µ and standard deviation s : Part VIII - The Part of Tens Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes Sources Index List of Figures List of Tables List of Sidebars  The distribution of all possible sample means, x, is approximately normal for sufficiently large sample sizes. That means you can use the normal distribution to answer questions or to draw conclusions about your sample mean.  See Chapter 8 for the normal distribution.   The larger the sample size  n  is, the closer the distribution of the sample means will be to a normal distribution.  Most statisticians agree that if n is at least 30, it will do a reasonable job in most cases.  The mean of the distribution of sample means is also µ.  The standard error of the sample means is   . It decreases as n increases.  If the original data have a normal distribution, the sample means will always have an exact normal distribution, no matter what the sample size is.  HEADS UP   If the population standard deviation, s , is unknown  which will be the case most of the time , you can estimate it using s, the sample standard deviation, for standard error in the preceding formula. More on this in Chapter 12.   Tip Note that the CLT says that even if the original data are not normally distributed, the  ISBN:0764554239  distribution of sample means will be normal, as long as the sample sizes are large enough. This, again, is due to the averaging effect.

Checking out the ACT math scores Consider the 2002 ACT math scores for male and female high school students.  This is a situation in which the population mean and standard deviation are known, because all of the tests taken in 2002 were graded and recorded.  The average ACT math score for male students was 21.2 with a standard   deviation of 5.3. Female students averaged 20.1  with a standard deviation of 4.8  on the same ACT Table of Contents math test. Prior research has shown that ACT scores have an approximate normal distribution.

The scores of male and female students are quite comparable. Index Suppose that you're interested in the average scores of samples of size 100 from the total population List of Figures of 500,000 male students who took the test in 2002. Why? Maybe you have 100 students in a class List of Tables and want to see how they did, compared to all other possible classes of this size. What will the List of Sidebars distribution of all possible sample means look like? According to the CLT, it will have a normal distribution with the same mean  21.2 , and the standard error will be 5.3 divided by the square root of 100  because in this hypothetical sample, n = 100 . Therefore the standard error for this sample is  Figure 9-2 shows what the sampling distribution of the sample means looks like for samples of 100 male students.

ISBN:0764554239  Figure 9-2: Average 2002 ACT math scores for male students for samples of size 100.  Notice in Figure 9-2 how much smaller the standard error of the sample means is, compared to the standard deviation of the original scores shown in Figure 9-1. That's because each sample mean in Figure 9-2 contains information from 100 students, compared to each individual score in Figure 9-1, which contains information from only a single student. Sample means won't vary as much as individual scores will. That's why using a sample mean is a much better idea for estimating the population mean than just using an individual score  or an anecdote .

For example, suppose you want to know the chance that a sample of 100 male students will have an average ACT math score of 22 or less. Using the technique shown in Chapter 8, you change the score of 22 to a standard score by subtracting the population mean  21.2  and dividing the difference by the standard error  instead of the standard deviation . The formula for this  Intervals  get –18, which is wrong.  REMEMBER A group of averages always has less variability than a group of individual scores. And  Tip Don't forget to find 22 – 21.2 first, before dividing by 0.53 in the precdeing example, or you'll   is the standard error. Note that s  is the population standard deviation  5.3 . and  In this example, where the standard error was calculated to be 5.3 ÷ v  100 = 0.53  see Figure 9-2 , the class average of 22 converts to a standard score of  22 -  21.2  ÷ 0.53 = 0.8 ÷ 0.53 = 1.51. You want to know the percentage of scores that lie to the left of this value  in other words, the percentile corresponding to a standard score of 1.51 .

REMEMBER Before you draw conclusions from any sample percentages, get some idea of how  much the results should vary by finding the standard error or the margin of error  which is about two standard errors; see Chapter 10 . Knowing the expected amount of variability will help you keep the results in perspective.  How large is large enough for the central limit theorem to work for categorical data? Most statisticians agree that you should have n × p and n ×  1 - p  both be greater than or equal to 5. This takes care of any situations in which the proportion is very close to either 1 or 0  in other words, those extreme situations where either almost everybody or almost nobody is in the group of interest . In these extreme situations, you'd need a larger sample to ensure that all the groups are represented, even those that don't contain many people. Most surveys and polls easily sample enough people to take care of this condition.  The CLT is good news for people who are trying to interpret sample results. As long as the sample size is large enough  and the data are credible and unbiased , the information reported will be close to the truth.  But remember, I said as long as the results are credible and unbiased. See Chapter 2 for examples of how statistics can go wrong.    HEADS UP   The central limit theorem also allows you to answer other important questions regarding sample means and proportions. For example, if a package delivery promises an average delivery time of two days, and your sample of 30 packages took 2.4 days, is this enough evidence to say that the company is guilty of false advertising? Or was this just an atypical sample of late packages? I address this type of question in Chapter 14.

This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life.  REMEMBER Small sample sizes result in sample means  and sample proportions  with large  Sample size   The size of the sample affects the amount of variability in the sample results. Suppose that you have a Table of Contents pond of fish, and you want to find the average length of all the fish in the pond. If you take repeated Statistics for Dummies random samples of size 100 and repeated random samples of size 1,000, recording the sample mean Introduction each time, which sample means would vary more, those of size 100 or those of size 1,000? Those of Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics size 100 would vary more, because each of the sample means was based on less information  that is, Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life on fewer fish . Sample proportions would be affected similarly.

Suppose that you have two ponds of fish, and you want to find the average length of all the Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples fish in each pond. The fish in Pond Vary-Lot are much more variable in length than the fish in Pond Part VII - Statistical Studies—The Inside Scoop VaryLittle are.

The sample means from Pond Vary-Lot would vary more, because the population of fish in Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control Pond Vary-Lot were more variable in their lengths to begin with. Part VIII - The Part of Tens Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes Sources Index List of Figures List of Tables List of Sidebars  Variability in sample proportions is affected in a similar way by the variability in the population. For example, suppose you want to estimate the proportion of fish in Pond Vary-Little that are in good health  call it p . If the fish in Pond Vary-Little are almost all either in good health  meaning p is close to 1 , the standard deviation of the population, p 1- p , is going to be small because most of the fish have the same health status. If you then take many samples of fish from this homogeneous  health- wise  population and find the percentage that is in good health, you shouldn't expect that percentage to change much from one sample to the next. So the standard error of the sample proportion is small when p is close to 1. The same thing happens when most of the fish are in poor health  p is close to 0 . However, if about 50% of the fish are in good health and 50% are in poor health, you'll see more variability in your sample proportions from sample to sample, because the population has more variability in its health. In fact, a population where p is equal to 0.5 has the most variability in it, resulting in the standard errors of the sample proportions to be at their largest, as well.  REMEMBER More variability in the original population contributes more variability to the standard  error of the sample means  or the sample proportions . Note that this increased variability can be offset, however, by increasing the sample size, as discussed above.   TECHNICAL STUFF   ISBN:0764554239  , and the variability in the  . The numerator of each of these formulas is  Recall that the variability of the sample means is  Statistics For Dummies sample proportions is  by Deborah Rumsey  actually the standard deviation of the original population in each case  s  for John Wiley & Sons   2003  356 pages  numerical data, and p[1 -  p] for categorical data . Therefore, as the population This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, standard deviation  the numerator  increases, the standard error  the entire fraction  techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life. also increases. More variability in the population means more variability in the sample means  or in the sample proportions . This increased variability can be offset by increasing the sample size, because as n  the denominator  increases, the overall fraction comprising the standard error decreases.  Anyone can plug numbers into a formula and report a measure of what they feel  or want you to believe  is the true accuracy of their results. But if those results are biased to begin with, their accuracy isn't relevant.  The formulas don't know this, though, so you need to be on the lookout.  Be sure to check to see how the sample in a particular study was selected and how the data were collected before examining any measures of how much those results are expected to vary.

Chapter 10: Leaving Room for a Margin of Error Overview Good survey and experiment researchers always include some measure of how accurate their results are, so that consumers of the information they generate can put the results into perspective. This   measure is called the margin of error — it's a measure of how close the sample result should be to the Table of Contents population parameter being studied. Statistics for Dummies Introduction Thankfully, many journalists are also realizing the importance of the margin of error in assessing information, so reports that include the margin of error are beginning to appear in the media. But what Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics does the margin of error really mean, and does it tell the whole story? Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong This chapter looks at the margin of error and what it can and can't do to help you assess the accuracy Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade of statistical information. It also examines the issue of sample size; you may be surprised at how small Part II - Number-Crunching Basics a sample can be used to get a good handle on the pulse of America — or the world — if the research Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs is done correctly.

The margin of error doesn't mean someone made a mistake; all it means is that you didn't get to sample everybody in the population, so you expect your sample results to be "off" by a certain amount. In other words, you acknowledge that your results could change with subsequent samples, and are only accurate to within a certain range, which is the margin of error.  Exploring the Importance of That Plus or Minus The margin of error is a term that you may have heard of before, most likely in the context of survey results. For example, you may have heard someone report, "This survey had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points." You may have wondered what you're supposed to do with that information, and how important it really is. The truth is, the survey results themselves  with no margin of error  are only a measure of how the sample of selected individuals felt about the issue; they don't   reflect how the entire population may have felt, had they all been asked  what a job that would be! . Table of Contents The margin of error helps you measure how close you are to the truth about the entire population Statistics for Dummies being studied, while still using only the information gathered from a sample of that population. Introduction Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics As discussed in Chapter 3, a sample is a representative group taken from the population you're Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life interested in studying. Results based on a sample won't be exactly the same as what you would've Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong found for the entire population, because when you take a sample, you don't get information from everyone in the population. But if the study is done right  see Chapter 17 for more about designing Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade good studies , the results from the sample should be close to the actual values for the entire Part II - Number-Crunching Basics population. Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More Part III - Determining the Odds Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win Part IV - Wading through the Results Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! Consider one example of the type of survey conducted by some of the leading polling organizations, Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error such as The Gallup Organization. Suppose its latest poll sampled 1,000 people from the United States, and the results show that 520 people  52%  think the president is doing a good job, compared Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence to 48% who don't think so. Suppose Gallup reports that this survey had a margin of error of plus or Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence minus 3%. Now, you know that the majority of the people in this sample approve of the president, but Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals can you say that the majority of all Americans approve of the president? In this case, you can't. Why Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples not? Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test If 52% of those sampled approve of the president, you can expect that the percent of the population of Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions all Americans who approve of the president will be 52%, plus or minus 3%. So you can say that Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples somewhere between 49% and 55% of all Americans approve of the president. That's as close as you Part VII - Statistical Studies—The Inside Scoop can get with your sample of 1,000. But notice that 49%, the lower end of this range, represents a Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls minority, because it's less than 50%. So you really can't say that a majority of the American people Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? support the president, based on this sample. You can only say that between 49% and 55% of all Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations Americans support the president, which may or may not be a majority. Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control Part VIII - The Part of Tens Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes Sources Index List of Figures List of Tables List of Sidebars  Think about the sample size for a moment. Isn't it interesting that a sample of only 1,000 Americans out of a population of more than 288,000,000 can lead you to be within plus or minus only 3% on your survey results? That's incredible! So for large populations, to get a really good idea of what's happening, you need to sample only a very tiny amount of the total. Statistics is indeed a powerful tool for finding out how people feel about issues. That's probably why so many people conduct surveys, and why you're so often bothered about responding to them.  Tip For a quick-and-dirty way to get a rough idea of what the margin of error is for any given  HEADS UP   Intervals  sample size, simply take the sample size  n , and then find 1 divided by the square root of n. For the Gallup poll example, n = 1,000 and its square root is roughly 31.62, so the margin of error is roughly 1 divided by 31.62, or about 0.03, which is equivalent to 3%. In the remainder of this chapter, you see how to get a more accurate measure of the margin of error.            ISBN:0764554239  Finding the Margin of Error: A General Formula The margin of error is the amount of "plus or minus" that is attached to your sample result when you move from discussing the sample itself to discussing the whole population that it represents. Therefore, you know that the general formula for the margin of error contains a "±" in front of it. So, how do you come up with that plus or minus amount  other than taking a rough estimate, as shown above ? This section shows you how.

Table of Contents Measuring sample variability Statistics for Dummies Introduction Sample results vary, but by how much? According to the central limit theorem  see Chapter 9 , when Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics sample sizes are large enough, the distribution of the sample proportions  or the sample averages  will Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life follow a bell-shaped curve  or normal distribution — see Chapter 8 . Some of the sample proportions Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong  or sample averages  will overestimate the population value and some will underestimate it, but most Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade will be close to the middle. And what's the middle? If you averaged out the results from all of the Part II - Number-Crunching Basics possible samples you could take, the average would be the real population proportion, in the case of Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs categorical data, or real the population average, in the case of numerical data. Normally, you don't Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More have the time or the money to look at all of the possible sample results and average them out, but Part III - Determining the Odds knowing something about all of the other sample possibilities does help you to measure the amount by Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability which you expect your one sample proportion  or average  to vary. Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win Standard errors are the basic building block of the margin of error. The standard error of a statistic is Part IV - Wading through the Results basically equal to the standard deviation of the data divided by the square root of n  the sample size .

See Chapter 9 for more about standard errors.  Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence The number of standard errors you wish to add or subtract to get the margin of error depends on how Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence confident you wish to be in your results  this is called your confidence level . Typically, you want to be about 95% confident, so the basic rule is to add or subtract about 2 standard errors  1.96, to be exact  Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals to get the margin of error. This allows you to account for about 95% of all possible results that may Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples have occurred with repeated sampling. To be 99% confident, you add and subtract about 3 standard Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test errors  2.58, to be exact .

See Chapter 8 for details.  For any given confidence level, a corresponding value on the standard normal distribution  called a Z-value  represents the number of standard errors to add and subtract to account for that confidence level. For 95% confidence, the exact Z-value is 1.96  which is "about" 2 , and for 99% confidence, the exact Z-value is 2.58  which is "about" 3 .

A good slogan to remember when examining statistical results is "garbage in equals garbage out." No matter how nice and scientific the margin of error may look, remember that the formula that was used to calculate it doesn't have any idea of the quality of the data that the margin of error is based on. If the sample proportion or sample average was based on a biased sample  one that favored certain people over others , a bad design, bad data-collection procedures, biased questions, or systematic errors in recording, then calculating the margin of error is pointless, because it won't mean a thing. For example, a total 50,000 people surveyed sounds great, but if they were all visitors to a certain Web site, the margin of error for this result means nothing, because the calculation is all based on biased, bogus results! Of Intervals course, some people go ahead and report it anyway, so you have to find out what went into the formula: good information or garbage? If it turns out to be garbage, you know what to do about the margin of error. Ignore it.

Pay starts from $80,000 to $95,000.  7.4 million U.S. residents took cruise vacations in 2002. Of those people, about 4 percent of them visited the ship's medical staff.

Intervals  How do you know that 26 million people play golf once at least once a year? Actually, this one may not be too hard to get, because golfers must always sign in whenever they play at a golf course. So, a survey of golf course sign-in sheets could give a good estimate of how many people play at least once a year.  The only hard part would be not doublecounting people you've counted before on previous sign-in sheets.   A survey may be able to estimate the percentage of cruisers who need medical attention or the percentage of homes purchased without a down payment. If the survey is done correctly  see   Chapter 16 , these data are probably pretty accurate.  How do you estimate how many nurse anesthetists are needed over the next eight years? You can start by looking at how many will be retiring in that time; but that won't account for growth. A prediction of the need in the next year or two would be close, but eight years into the future is much harder to do.

Why estimate the median  middle number  and not the mean  average  household income?  See Chapter 5 for more discussion on the mean versus the median.  Because household income tends to be skewed, with many folks at the lower end of the income spectrum, and fewer individuals at the extreme upper end.

Table of Contents To estimate the median household income, the Census Bureau takes a random sample of about Statistics for Dummies 28,000 households and asks questions  household income is among those questions . Based on the Introduction sample data of 28,000 homes, the Bureau calculates the median household income for this sample: Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics For the year 2000, the sample median household income was $42,228. Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life The Census Bureau uses the sample median household income  a statistic  to estimate the median Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong household income for the whole U.S.  the parameter . Yet because the Bureau knows that a sample Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade can't possibly reflect the entire population completely accurately, it includes a margin of error  see Part II - Number-Crunching Basics Chapter 10  with the results. This plus or minus  ±  that's added to any estimate, helps put the results Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs into perspective. When you know the margin of error, you have an idea of how much error may be in Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More the estimate, due to the fact that it was based on a sample of the population and not on the entire Part III - Determining the Odds population.

Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence  Because the Bureau didn't sample the entire population and knows that the sample may not represent the entire population perfectly, the Bureau calculates a margin of error for the median of the sample group and includes that as part of the estimate. For the year 2000, the margin of error of the sample median household income was $258. The U.S. Census Bureau therefore estimates that in 2000, the median household income was $42,228, plus or minus $258 or $42,228 ± $258. This represents the confidence interval for the median household income of the United States  see the following section about confidence intervals .

In this way, your result presents an estimate based on your sample, along with some indicator of how much that estimate could vary from sample to sample.

ISBN:0764554239  A statistic plus or minus a margin of error is called a confidence interval:  The word confidence is used because you have a certain amount of confidence in the process by which you got your interval. This is called your confidence level.  The word interval is used because your result becomes an interval. For example, say the percentage of kids who like baseball is 40 percent, plus or minus 3.5 percent. That means the percentage of kids who like baseball is somewhere between 40% - 3.5% = 36.5% and 40% + 3.5% = 43.5%. Thus, the lower end of the interval is your statistic minus the margin of error, and the upper end is your statistic plus the margin of error.

Not all estimates are as accurate and reliable as some may want you to think. For example, a Web site survey result based on 20,000 hits may have a small margin of error according to the formula, but the margin of error means nothing if the survey is only given to people who happened to visit that Web site. In other words, the sample isn't even close to being a random sample  where everyone in the population has an equal chance of being chosen to participate . Nevertheless, such results do get reported, along with their margins of error that make the study seem truly scientific. Beware of these bogus results!

Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More Calculating a Confidence Interval Part III - Determining the Odds Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability A confidence interval is composed of a statistic, plus or minus a margin of error  see Chapter 10 . For Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win example, suppose you want to know the percentage of vehicles in the United States that are pickup Part IV - Wading through the Results trucks  that's the parameter, in this case . You can't look at every single vehicle in the United States, so Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing you take a random sample of 1,000 vehicles over a range of highways at different times of the day. Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! You find that 7% of the vehicles in your sample are pickup trucks. Now, you don't want to say that Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error exactly 7% of all vehicles on U.S. roads are pickup trucks, because you know this is only based on the 1,000 vehicles you sampled. While you hope that 7% is close to the true percentage, you can't be sure Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence because you based your results on a sample of vehicles, not on all of the vehicles in the United States. Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence So what to do? You add and subtract a margin of error to indicate how much error you expect your Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals sample result to have.  See Chapter 10 for more on the margin of error.  The error isn't due to Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples anything you did wrong, it simply comes from the fact that a sample  a study of a portion of the Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test population , not a census  a study of the entire population , was done. Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples The width of your confidence interval is two times the margin of error. For example, suppose the Part VII - Statistical Studies—The Inside Scoop margin of error was 5%. A confidence interval of 7%, plus or minus 5%, goes from 7% - 5% = 2%, all Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls the way up to 7% + 5% = 12%. That means it has a width of 12% - 2% = 10%. A simpler way to Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? calculate this is to say that the width of the confidence interval is two times the margin of error.

Choosing a Confidence Level Notice that the example showing teen attitudes towards tobacco  see the "Teens attitude toward smokeless tobacco" sidebar  includes the phrase a "95% confidence interval." Every confidence interval  and every margin of error, for that matter  has a confidence level associated with it. In that example, the confidence level was 95%. A confidence level helps you account for the other possible sample results you could have gotten, when you're making an estimate of a parameter using the data   from only one sample. If you want to account for 95% of the other possible results, your confidence Table of Contents level would be 95%. Statistics for Dummies Introduction Variability in sample results is measured in terms of number of standard errors. A standard error is Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics similar to the standard deviation of a data set, only a standard error applies to sample means or Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life sample percentages that you could have gotten, if different samples were taken.  See Chapter 10 for Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong information on standard errors.  Every confidence level has a corresponding number of standard errors that have to be added or subtracted. This number of standard errors is called the Z-value Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade  because it corresponds to the standard normal distribution . See Table 10-1 in Chapter 10. Part II - Number-Crunching Basics Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs What level of confidence level is typically used by researchers? I've seen confidence levels ranging Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More from 80% to 99%. The most common confidence level is 95%. In fact, statisticians have a saying that Part III - Determining the Odds goes, "Why do statisticians like their jobs? Because they have to be correct only 95% of the time." Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability  Tacky, but sort of catchy, isn't it?  Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win Part IV - Wading through the Results Being 95% confident means that if you take many, many samples, and calculate a confidence interval Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing each time, based on the results, 95% of those samples will result in confidence intervals that are right Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! on target and actually contain the true parameter. In order to have a 95% confidence level, the Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error empirical rule says that you need to add and subtract "about" 2 standard errors. The central limit theorem allows you to be more exact about the amount, so the "about 2" actually becomes 1.96. See Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence Table 10-1 in Chapter 10 for selected confidence levels and their corresponding Z-values. Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence If you want to be more than 95% confident about your results, you need to add and subtract more than Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals two standard errors. For example, to be 99% confident, you would add and subtract about three Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples standard errors to obtain your margin of error. The higher the confidence level, the larger the Z-value, Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test the larger the margin of error, and the wider the confidence interval  assuming everything else stays Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions the same . You have to pay a certain price for more confidence. Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples Part VII - Statistical Studies—The Inside Scoop Note I said "assuming everything else stays the same."

Zooming In on Width The ultimate goal when making an estimate using a confidence interval is to have the confidence interval be narrow. That means you're zooming in on what the parameter is. Having to add and subtract a large amount only makes your result much less accurate. For example, suppose you're trying to estimate the percentage of semi trucks on the interstate between the hours of 12 a.m. and 6 a.m., and you come up with a 95% confidence interval that claims the percentage of semis is 50%,   plus or minus 50%. Wow, that narrows it down!  Not.  You've defeated the purpose of trying to come Table of Contents up with a good estimate. Statistics for Dummies Introduction In this case, the confidence interval is much too wide. You'd rather say something like this: A 95% Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics confidence interval for the percentage of semis on the interstate between 12 a.m. and 6 a.m. is 50%, Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life plus or minus 3%. This would require a much larger sample size, but that would be worthwhile. Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong So, if a small margin of error is good, is smaller even better? Not always. To get an extremely narrow Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade confidence interval, you have to conduct a much more difficult — and expensive — study, so a point Part II - Number-Crunching Basics comes where the increase in price doesn't justify the marginal difference in accuracy. Most people are Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs pretty comfortable with a margin of error of 2% to 3% when the estimate itself is a percentage  like the Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More percentage of women, Republicans, or smokers . Part III - Determining the Odds Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win How do you go about ensuring that your confidence interval will be narrow enough? You certainly want Part IV - Wading through the Results to think about this issue before collecting your data; after the data are collected, the width of the Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing confidence interval is set.

See Chapter 10 for more on standard error.   HEADS UP   Note that the sample statistic itself  for example, 7% of vehicles in the sample are pickup trucks  isn't related to the width of the confidence interval. Instead, the margin of error and the three factors involved in it are totally responsible for determining the width of a confidence interval.         Factoring In the Sample Size The relationship between margin of error and sample size is simple: As the sample size increases, the margin of error decreases. This confirms what you hope is true: The more information you have, the more accurate your results are going to be.  That of course, assumes that the information is good, credible information.

You can try different values of n and you can see how the margin of error is affected.  When you need a high level of confidence, you have to increase the Z-value and, hence, margin of error, resulting in a wider confidence interval, which isn't good. But, you can offset this wider confidence interval by increasing the sample size and bringing the margin of error back down, thus narrowing the confidence interval. The increase in sample size allows you to still have the confidence level you want, but also ensures that the width of your confidence interval will be small  which is what you ultimately want . You can even determine this information before you start a study: If you know the margin of error you want to get, you can set your sample size accordingly  see Chapter 9 .

Counting On Population Variability One of the factors influencing variability in sample results is the fact that the population itself contains variability. If every value in the population were exactly the same, imagine how boring the world would be.  In fact, statisticians wouldn't exist if not for variability.  For example, in a population of houses in a large city like Columbus, Ohio, you see a great deal of variety in not only the types of houses, but also the sizes, and the prices. And the variability in prices of houses in Columbus, Ohio, should be more   than the variability in prices of houses in a selected housing development in Columbus. Table of Contents Statistics for Dummies That means if you take a sample of houses from the entire city of Columbus and find the average Introduction price, the margin of error should be larger than if you take a sample from that single housing Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics development in Columbus, even if you have the same confidence level and the same sample size Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life each time. Why? Because the houses in the entire city have more variability in price, and your sample Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong average would change more from sample to sample than it would if you took the sample only from that single housing development, where the prices tend to be very similar. That means you need to Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade sample more houses if you're sampling from the entire city of Columbus in order to have the same Part II - Number-Crunching Basics amount of accuracy that you would get from that single housing development.

The lower end of the CI is x minus the margin of error, while the upper end of the CI is x plus the margin of error.  Find the sample mean  x , the sample standard deviation  s , and the sample size  n .  Determine the confidence level and find the appropriate Z-value.  Multiply Z times s and divide that by the square root of n.  Take x plus or minus the margin of error to obtain the CI.  This is the margin of error.  See Chapter 3.  Intervals  1.  2.  3.  Because you want a 95% confidence interval, your Z is 1.96.  Suppose you take a random sample of 100 fingerlings, and you determine that the average length is 7.5 inches and the standard deviation  s  is 2.3 inches.  See Chapter 4 for calculating the mean and standard deviation.  This means x = 7.5, s = 2.3, and n = 100.  Multiply 1.96 times 2.3 divided by the square root of 100 =  10 . The margin of error is, therefore, plus or minus 1.96 ×  2.3 ÷ 10  = 1.96 × 0.23 = 0.45 inches.   Your 95% confidence interval for the mean length of walleye fingerlings in this fish hatchery pond is 7.5 inches plus or minus 0.45 inches.  The lower end of the interval is 7.5 -  0.45 = 7.05 inches; the upper end is 7.5 + 0.45 = 7.95 inches.  You can say then, with 95% confidence, that the average length of walleye fingerlings in this entire fish hatchery pond is between 7.05 and 7.95 inches, based on your sample.

Determining the Confidence Interval for the Population Proportion When a characteristic being measured is categorical  for example, opinion on an issue [support, oppose, or are neutral], gender, political party, or type of behavior [do don't wear a seatbelt while driving] , most people want to report the proportion  or percentage  of people in the population that fall into a certain category of interest. For example, the percentage of people in favor of a four day work week, the percentage of Republicans who voted in the last election, or the proportion of drivers who   don't wear seat belts. In each of these cases, the object is to estimate a population proportion using a Table of Contents sample proportion plus or minus a margin of error. The result is called a confidence interval for the Statistics for Dummies population proportion.

Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations For example, suppose you want to estimate the percentage of the times you get a red light at a certain Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control intersection. Part VIII - The Part of Tens Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes Sources Index List of Figures List of Tables List of Sidebars  You take a random sample of 100 different trips through this intersection, and you find that you hit a red light 53 times, so  Take 0.53 times  1 -  0.53  and divide by 100 to get 0.2491 ÷ 100 = 0.002491.  Because you want a 95% confidence interval, your Z-value is 1.96.   = 53 ÷ 100 = 0.53.  Take the square root to get 0.0499.  The margin of error is, therefore, plus or minus 1.96 ×  0.0499  = 0.0978.  Your 95% confidence interval for the percentage of times you will ever hit a red light at that particular intersection is 0.53  or 53%  plus or minus 0.0978  rounded to 0.10 or 10% .  The lower end of the interval is 0.53 -  0.10 = 0.43 or 43%; the upper end is 0.53 + 0.10 = 0.63 or 63%.  In other words, you can say that with 95% confidence, the percentage of the times you should expect to hit a red light at this intersection is somewhere between 43% and 63%, based on your sample.   Tip While performing any calculations involving sample percentages, use the decimal form. After the calculations are finished, convert to percentages by multiplying by 100. To avoid round-off error, keep at least 2 decimal places throughout.

Developing a Confidence Interval for the Difference of Two Means The goal of many surveys and studies is to compare two populations, such as men versus women, low versus high income families, and Republicans versus Democrats. When the characteristic being compared is numerical  for example, height, weight, or income  the object of interest is the amount of difference in the means  averages  for the two populations. For example, you may want to compare the difference in average age of Republicans versus Democrats, or the difference in average incomes   of men versus women. You estimate the difference between two population means by taking a sample Table of Contents from each population and using the difference of the two sample means, plus or minus a margin of Statistics for Dummies error. The result is a confidence interval for the difference of two population means. Introduction Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics The formula for a CI for the difference between two population means  averages  is Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong , where x, s 1, and n1 are the mean, standard deviation and size of the first sample, and y, s 2, and n2 are the mean, standard deviation and size of the second sample. Z is the Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade appropriate value from the standard normal distribution for your desired confidence level.  See Part II - Number-Crunching Basics Chapter 3 for formulas and calculations for means and standard deviations; see Chapter 10  Table Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs 10-1  for values of Z for certain confidence levels.

This is the margin of error. Take  x -  y  plus or minus the margin of error to obtain the CI. The lower end of the CI is  x -  y  minus the margin of error, while the upper end of the CI is  x -  y-  plus the margin of error.

Call the two varieties Corn-e-stats and Stats-o-sweet. Index List of Figures List of Tables List of Sidebars  Because you want a 95% confidence interval, your Z is 1.96.  Multiply your answer from Step 4 by Z.  2.  3.  4.  5.  6.  Suppose your random sample of 100 cobs of the Corn-e-stats variety averages 8.5 inches, with a standard deviation of 2.3 inches, and your random sample of 110 cobs of Stats-o-sweet averages 7.5 inches, with a standard deviation of 2.8 inches. This means x = 8.5, s1 = 2.3, and n1 = 100; y = 7.5, s2 = 2.8, and n2 = 110. The difference between the sample means,  x -  y , from Step 3, is 8.5 -  7.5 = +1 inch. This means the average for Corn-e-stats minus the average for Stats-o-sweet is positive, making Corn-e-stats the larger of the two varieties, in terms of this sample. Is that difference enough to generalize to the entire population, though? That's what this confidence interval is going to help you decide.  Square s 1  2.3  to get 5.29; divide by 100 to get 0.0529. Square s2  2.8  and divide by 110: 7.84   ÷ 110 = 0.0713. The sum is 0.0529 + 0.0713 = 0.1242; the square root of this is 0.3524.  Multiply 1.96 times 0.3524 to get 0.69 inches, the margin of error.

Notice that you could get a negative value for  x -  y . For example, if you had switched the two varieties of corn, you would have gotten - 1 for this difference. That's fine; just remember which group is which. A positive difference means the first group has a larger value than the second group; a negative difference means the first group has a smaller value than the second group. If you want to avoid negative values, always make the group with the larger value your first group — all your differences will be positive.  Your 95% confidence interval for the difference between the average lengths for these two varieties of sweet corn is 1 inch, plus or minus 0.69 inches.  The lower end of the interval is 1 - 0.69 = 0.31 inches; the upper end is 1 + 0.69 = 1.69 inches.  That means you can say, with 95% confidence, that the Corn-e-stats variety is longer, on average, than the Stats-o-sweet variety, by somewhere between 0.31 and 1.69 inches.  Notice all the values in this interval are positive. That means Corn-e-stats should always on average be longer than Stats-o-sweet, based on   your data.

Responding to Claims: Some Do's and Don'ts In today's age of information  and big money , a great deal rides on being able to back up your claims. Companies that say their products are better than the leading brand better be able to prove it, or they could face lawsuits.

Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions Steering clear of anecdotes Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples Part VII - Statistical Studies—The Inside Scoop The second option for responding to a claim, the test-it-yourself approach, is one that is taken by many Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls organizations, such as The Gallup Organization, which conducts its own polls; the Insurance Institute Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? for Highway Safety, which crash tests and reports on the safety of vehicles; Consumer Reports, which Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations tests and reports on product quality and value; and the Good Housekeeping Institute, which tests Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control products before giving them its Seal of Approval.

One way that the media tests product claims is by sending people out into the field to check products out for themselves. This is an overused and unscientific  yet fun  method for testing a hypothesis. For example, suppose some TV show has determined that the world has to know: Does it really take five minutes to make a certain name-brand five-minute pie? Maybe it actually takes more, maybe it takes less. Statistically speaking, the variable of interest here is numerical — preparation time — and the population is all of the pies made using that name-brand recipe. The parameter of interest is the   ISBN:0764554239  average preparation time for all pies made with that recipe.  A parameter is a single number that summarizes the population and is typically what the claim is about.  The claim here is that the average preparation time is 5 minutes.

And they'd end with a comment that using Snickers bars on top of this name-brand pie is a good candy bar choice  it is, by the way .    Table of Contents If these TV shows ever had a resident statistician who could give the statistical breakdown of the Statistics for Dummies results  a real ratings booster, I know , I'd jump at that chance. The main idea I'd want to get across to Introduction the audience is that sample results vary  from person to person, from pie to pie  — see Chapter 9 for Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics more on this.

Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence  Beware of any study results based on extremely small sample sizes, especially those based on a sample size of 1.

Table of Contents Statistics for Dummies HEADS Introduction UP  Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life Defining what you're testing Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade Part II - Number-Crunching Basics To get more specific, the varicose vein claim is that the parameter, the population proportion  p , is Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs equal to 0.25.  This claim is called the null hypothesis.  If you're out to test this claim, you're Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More questioning the claim and have a hypothesis of your own  called the research hypothesis, or Part III - Determining the Odds alternative hypothesis . You may hypothesize, for example, that the actual proportion of women who Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability have varicose veins is lower than 0.25, based on your observations. Or, you may hypothesize that due to the popularity of high heeled shoes, the proportion may be higher than 0.25. Or, if you're simply Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win questioning whether the actual proportion is 0.25, your alternative hypothesis is, "No, it isn't 0.25." Part IV - Wading through the Results Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing In addition to testing hypotheses about categorical variables  having or not having varicose veins is a Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! categorical variable , you can also test hypotheses about numerical variables, such as the average Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error commuting time for people working in Los Angeles or their average household income. In these cases, Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence the parameter of interest is the population average or mean  denoted µ . Again, the claim is that this Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence parameter is equal to a certain value, versus some alternative. Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals Hypotheses can be tested about more than one single population parameter, too. For example, you Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples may want to compare average household incomes or commuting times of people from two or more Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test major cities. Or you may want to see whether a link exists between commuting time and income. All of Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions these questions can be answered using hypothesis tests; while the details differ for each situation, the Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples general ideas are the same.

Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? Setting up the hypotheses Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control Part VIII - The Part of Tens Every hypothesis test contains two hypotheses. The first hypothesis is called the null hypothesis, Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey denoted Ho. The null hypothesis always states that the population parameter is equal to the claimed Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes value. For example, if the claim is that the average time to make a name-brand ready-mix pie is five minutes, the statistical shorthand notation for the null hypothesis in this case would be as follows: Ho: µ Sources = 5. Index List of Figures What's the alternative? List of Tables List of Sidebars Before actually conducting a hypothesis test, you have to put two possible hypotheses on the table — the null hypothesis is one of them. But, if the null hypothesis is found not to be true, what's your alternative going to be? Actually, three possibilities exist for the second  or alternative  hypothesis, denoted Ha. Here they are, along with their shorthand notations in the context of the example:  Intervals  The population parameter is not equal to the claimed value  Ha: µ  5 . The population parameter is greater than the claimed value  Ha: µ > 5 . The population parameter is less than the claimed value  Ha: µ < 5 .  Which alternative hypothesis you choose in setting up your hypothesis test depends on what you're interested in concluding, should you have enough evidence to refute the null hypothesis  the claim .   ISBN:0764554239  Tip Hypothesis tests are similar to jury trials, in a sense. In a jury trial, Ho is similar to the not-guilty  verdict, and Ha is the guilty verdict. You assume in a jury trial that the defendant isn't guilty unless the prosecution can show beyond a reasonable doubt that he or she is guilty. If the jury says the evidence is beyond a reasonable doubt, they reject Ho, not guilty, in favor of Ha, guilty.  Statistics For Dummies by Deborah Rumsey  John Wiley & Sons   2003  356 pages  This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life.  For example, if you want to test whether a company is correct in claiming its pie takes 5 minutes to make and you also want to know whether the actual average time is more or less than that, you use the not-equal-to alternative. Your hypotheses for that test would be Ho: µ = 5 versus H a: µ  5. If you only want to see whether the time turns out to be greater than what the company claims  that is, the company is falsely advertising its prep time , you use the greater-than alternative, and your two hypotheses are Ho: µ = 5 versus H a: µ > 5. Finally, say you work for the company marketing the pie, and you think the pie can be made in less   than 5 minutes  and could be marketed by the company as such .

And in that case, where you have sufficient Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! evidence against Ho, you reject Ho in favor of Ha. The burden of proof is on the researcher to show Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error sufficient evidence against Ho before it's rejected.  That's why Ha is often called the research hypothesis, because Ha is the hypothesis that the researcher is most interested in showing.  If Ho is Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence rejected in favor of Ha, the researcher can say he or she has found a statistically significant result; that Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence is, the results refute the previous claim, and something different or new is happening.

Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control Part VIII - The Part of Tens Gathering the evidence: The sample Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes After you've set up the hypotheses, the next step is to collect your evidence and determine whether Sources your evidence corroborates the claim made in Ho. Remember, the claim is made about the population, Index but you can't test the whole population; the best you can usually do is take a sample. As with any other List of Figures situation in which statistics are being collected, the quality of the data is extremely critical.  See List of Tables Chapter 2 for lots of examples of statistics that have gone wrong.  List of Sidebars Good data start with a good sample. The two main issues to consider when selecting your sample are avoiding bias and being accurate. To avoid bias, take a random sample  meaning everyone in the population must have an equal chance of being chosen  and choose a large enough sample size so that the results will be accurate.  See Chapter 3.   In many cases, people set up hypothesis tests because they're out to show that Ho isn't true, supporting the alternative hypothesis.  The mentality is, why do research just to show that something has stayed the same?  The results that you hear about in the media are generally the ones that are able to show Ho isn't true; this is what makes news. In many cases that's a good thing, though, because researchers and manufacturers have to stay on their toes to avoid negative publicity surrounding a product recall, a lawsuit, or a government investigation. That's because if one of their claims  Ho  is rejected by someone conducting an independent hypothesis test, the researchers or manufacturers are being judged as guilty of false advertising or false claims, which is not good.  HEADS UP   Intervals  Compiling the evidence: The statistics After you select your sample, the appropriate number-crunching takes place. Your null hypothesis makes a statement about what the population parameter is  for example, the proportion of all women who have varicose veins or the average miles per gallon of a U.S.-built light truck . In statistical jargon, the data you collect measure that variable of interest, and the statistics that you calculate will include   ISBN:0764554239  the sample statistic that most closely estimates the population parameter. In other words, if you're testing a claim about the proportion of women with varicose veins, you need to calculate the proportion of women in your sample who have varicose veins. If you're testing a claim about the average miles per gallon of a U.S.-built light truck, your statistic should be the average miles per gallon of the light trucks in your sample.  See Chapter 5 for all the information you need on calculating statistics.

Standardizing the evidence: The test statistic After you have your sample statistic, you may think you're done with the analysis part and are ready to   make your conclusions — but you're not. The problem is, you have no way to put your results into any Table of Contents kind of perspective just by looking at them in their regular units. That's because you know that your Statistics for Dummies results are based only on a sample and that sample results are going to vary. That variation needs to Introduction be taken into account, or your conclusions could be completely wrong.  How much do sample results Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics vary? Sample variation is measured by the standard error; see Chapter 9 for more on this.  Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong Suppose the claim is that the percentage of all women with varicose veins is 25 percent, and your sample of 100 women had 20 percent with varicose veins. The standard error for your sample Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade percentage is 4 percent  according to formulas in Chapter 9 , which means that your results are Part II - Number-Crunching Basics expected to vary by about twice that, or about 8 percent, according to the empirical rule  see Chapter Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs 10 . So a difference of 5 percent between the claim and your sample result  25% -  20% = 5%  isn't Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More that much, in these terms. This represents a distance of less than 2 standard errors away from the Part III - Determining the Odds claim. Therefore, you accept the claim, Ho, because your data can't refute it. Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win However, suppose your sample percentage was based on a sample of 1,000 women, not 100. This Part IV - Wading through the Results decreases the amount by which you expect your results to vary, because you have more information. Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing The standard error becomes 0.012 or 1.2 percent, and the margin of error is twice that, or 2.4 percent Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! on either side. Now a difference of 5 percent between your sample result  20 percent  and the claim Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error  25 percent  is a more meaningful difference; it's way more than 2 standard errors away from the Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence claim. Your results being based on 1,000 people shouldn't vary that much from the claim, so what Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence should you conclude? The claim  Ho  is concluded to be false, because your data don't support it. Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals The number of standard errors that a statistic lies above or below the mean is called a standard score Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples  see Chapter 8 . In order to interpret your statistic, you need to convert it from original units to a standard score. When finding a standard score, you take your statistic, subtract the mean, and divide Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test the result by the standard error. In the case of hypothesis tests, you use the value in Ho as the mean. Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions  That's because you assume Ho is true, unless you have enough evidence against it.  This Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples standardized version of your statistic is called a test statistic, and it's the main component of a Part VII - Statistical Studies—The Inside Scoop hypothesis test.  Chapter 15 contains the formulas for the most common hypothesis tests.  Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results?

In the case of a single population mean or Index proportion, you know that these standardized distances should have a standard normal distribution if List of Figures your sample size is large enough  see Chapters 8 and 9 . So, to interpret your test statistic in these List of Tables cases, you can see where it stands on the standard normal distribution  Z-distribution . List of Sidebars  Take your statistic minus the claimed value  given by Ho . Divide by the standard error of the statistic  see Chapters 9 and 10 .  Intervals  2.  1.  Although you never expect a sample statistic to be exactly the same as the population value, you expect it to be close if Ho is true. That means, if you see that the distance between the claim and the sample statistic is small, in terms of standard errors, your sample isn't far from the claim and your data are telling you to stick with Ho. As that distance becomes larger and larger, however, your data are showing less and less support for Ho. At some point, you should reject Ho based on your evidence, and choose Ha. At what point does this happen? The next section addresses that issue.         ISBN:0764554239  Statistics For Dummies by Deborah Rumsey  John Wiley & Sons   2003  356 pages  This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life.  Weighing the Evidence and Making Decisions: P-Values To test whether the claim is true, you're looking at your test statistic taken from your sample, and seeing whether it supports the claim. And how do you determine that? For most cases, by looking at where your test statistic ends up on the standard normal distribution  Z-distribution  — see Chapter 9. The Z-distribution has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. If your test statistic is close to 0, or at least within that range where most of the results should fall, then you say yes, the claim  Ho  is   probably true, and the sample results verify it. If your test statistic is out in the tails of the standard Table of Contents normal distribution, then you say no, the chance of my sample results ending up this far out on the Statistics for Dummies distribution is too small; my sample results don't verify the claim  Ho . But how far is "too far" from 0? Introduction As long as you have a large enough sample size, you know that your test statistic falls somewhere on Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics a standard normal distribution, according to the central limit theorem  see Chapter 10 . If the null Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life hypothesis is true, most  about 95%  of the samples will result in test statistics that lie roughly within 2 Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong standard errors of the claim. If Ha is the not equal-to alternative, any test statistic outside this range will Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade result in Ho being rejected  see Figure 14-1 .

Note that if the alternative hypothesis is the less-than alternative, you reject Ho only if the test statistic falls in the left tail of the distribution. Similarly, if Ha is the greater- than alternative, you reject Ho only if the test statistic falls in the right tail.

The p-value measures how likely it was Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control that you would have gotten your sample results if the null hypothesis were true. The farther out your Part VIII - The Part of Tens test statistic is on the tails of the standard normal distribution, the smaller the p-value will be, and the Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey more evidence you have against the null hypothesis being true. Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes Sources Index To find the p-value for your test statistic  means porportions, large samples : List of Figures List of Tables List of Sidebars  Look up the location of your test statistic on the standard normal distribution  see Table 8-1 in Chapter 8 .  REMEMBER All p-values are probabilities between 0 and 1.  TECHNICAL STUFF   Intervals  1.  2.  Find the percentage chance of being at or beyond that value in the same direction:  If Ha contains a less-than alternative, find the percentile from Table 8-1 in Chapter 8 that corresponds to your test statistic.  If Ha contains a greater-than alternative, find the percentile from Table 8-1 in Chapter 8 that corresponds to your test statistic, and then take 100% minus that.  You want the percentage to the right of your test statistic in this case, and percentiles give you the percentage to the left. See Chapter 5.   3.  Double this percentage if  and only if  Hais the not-equal-to alternative.  a.  b.  4.   3.  4.  This accounts for both the less-than and the greater-than possibilities.

ISBN:0764554239  For large p-values  generally greater than 0.05 , you can't reject Ho. You don't have enough evidence against it.  For small p-values  generally less than 0.05 , reject Ho. Your data don't support Ho, and your evidence is beyond a reasonable doubt.   Table of Contents Statistics for Dummies If your p-value is on or close to the borderline between accepting and rejecting, your results are Introduction marginal.  They could go either way.  Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life Generally, statisticians stay with Ho unless the evidence is beyond a reasonable doubt, just like in a Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong courtroom. What probability reflects that cutoff point? It can be rather arbitrary  the term "small p- Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade value" can mean something different to each person . For most statisticians, if the p-value is less than Part II - Number-Crunching Basics 0.05 given the data they collect, they'll reject Ho, and choose Ha. Some people may have stricter Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs cutoffs, such as 0.01, requiring more evidence before rejecting Ho. Each reader makes his her own Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More decision. That's why researchers need to report p-values, rather than just their decisions, so that Part III - Determining the Odds people can come to their own conclusions based on their own internal cutoff points. For example, if Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability your p-value is 0.026 when testing H o: p = 0.25 versus H a: p < 0.25 in the varicose veins example, a Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win reader with a personal cutoff point of 0.05 would conclude that Ho is false, because the p-value  of Part IV - Wading through the Results 0.026  is less than 0.05. However, a reader with a personal cutoff of 0.01 would not have enough Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing evidence  based on your sample  to reject Ho, because the p-value of 0.026 is greater than 0.01. Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! Caution: Interpretations will vary! Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence Some people do like to set a cutoff probability before doing a hypothesis test; this is called an alpha level  a  .

If the p-value is close to 0.05, the results are considered marginally significant — decision could go either way.

This is a big deal. If the group can stand by its statistics, it has done well Part IV - Wading through the Results to inform the public about the false advertising issue. But what if the group is wrong? Even if the study Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing is based on a good design, collects good data, and makes the right analysis, the group can still be Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! wrong. Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error Why? Because its conclusions were based on a sample of packages, not on the entire population. And Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence Chapter 9 tells you, sample results vary from sample to sample. If your test statistic falls on the tail of Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence the standard normal distribution, these results are unusual, if the claim is true, because you expect Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals them to be much closer to the middle of the standard normal distribution  Z-distribution . Just because Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples the results from a sample are unusual, however, doesn't mean they're impossible. A p-value of 0.04 means that the chance of getting your particular test statistic  out on the tail of the standard normal Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test distribution , even if the claim is true, is 4%  less than 5% . That's why you reject Ho in this case, Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions because that chance is so small. But a chance is a chance! Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples Part VII - Statistical Studies—The Inside Scoop Perhaps your sample, while collected randomly, just happens to be one of those atypical samples Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls whose result ended up far out on the distribution.

Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control Part VIII - The Part of Tens Rejecting Ho when you shouldn't is called a type-1 error. I don't really like this name, because it seems Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey so nondescript. I prefer to call a type-1 error a false alarm. In the case of the packages, if the Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes consumer group made a type-1 error when it rejected the company's claim, they created a false alarm. What's the result? A very angry delivery company, I guarantee that! Sources Index Missing a detection: Type-2 errors List of Figures List of Tables On the other hand, suppose the company really wasn't delivering on its claim. Who's to say that the List of Sidebars consumer group's sample will detect it? If the actual delivery time is 2.1 days instead of 2 days, the difference would be pretty hard to detect. If the actual delivery time is 3 days, a fairly small sample would show that something's up. The issue lies with those in-between values, like 2.5 days. If Ho is indeed false, you want to find out about it and reject Ho. Not rejecting Ho when you should have is called a type-2 error. I like to call it a missed detection.  Sample size is the key to being able to detect situations where Ho is false and to avoiding type-2 errors. The more information you have, the less variable your results will be  see Chapter 8  and the more ability you have to zoom in on detecting problems that exist with a claim.  This ability to detect when Ho is truly false is called the power of a test. Power is a pretty complicated issue, but what's important for you to know is that the higher the sample size, the more powerful a test   is. A powerful test has a small chance for a type-2 error.  HEADS UP   Take any statistically significant results with a grain of salt, no matter how well the study was conducted. Whatever decision was made, that decision could be wrong.

All p-values have the same interpretation, no matter what test is done. So anywhere you see a p-value, you will know that a small p-value means the researcher found a "statistically significant" result, which means the null hypothesis was rejected.  You also know, regardless of which hypothesis test someone used, that any conclusions that are made are subject to the process of data collection and analysis being done Intervals correctly. Even then, under the best of situations, the data could still be unrepresentative just by chance, or the truth could have been too hard to detect, and the wrong decision could be made. But that's part of what makes statistics such a fun subject — you never know if what you're doing is correct, but you always know that what you're doing is right; does that make sense?

For means porportions, in the case where the sample size is small  and by small, I mean dropping Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations below 30 or so , you have less information on which to base your conclusions. Another drawback is Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control that you can't rely on the standard normal distribution  Z-distribution  to compare your test statistic, Part VIII - The Part of Tens because the central limit theorem hasn't kicked in yet.  The central limit theorem requires sample Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey sizes that are large enough for the results to average out to a bell-shaped curve; see Chapter 8 for Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes more on this.  You already know you should disregard results that are based on very small sample Sources sizes  especially those with a sample size of 1 . So, what do you do in those in-between situations, in Index which the sample size isn't small enough to disregard and isn't large enough to use the standard List of Figures normal distribution to weigh your evidence? You use a different distribution, called a t-distribution.  You List of Tables may have heard of the term t-test before, in terms of hypothesis testing. This is where that term comes List of Sidebars from.   HEADS UP   The t-distribution is basically a shorter, fatter version of the standard normal distribution  Z-distribution . The idea is, you should have to pay a penalty for having less information, and that penalty is a distribution that has fatter tails. To make a touchdown  getting into that magic 5% range where Ho is rejected  with a smaller sample size is going to mean having to go farther out, proving yourself more, and having stronger evidence than you normally would if you had a larger sample size.

What's the penalty? A List of Tables larger p-value than one that the standard normal distribution would have given you for the same test List of Sidebars statistic. That's because of the fatter tails on the t-distribution; a test statistic far out on the leaner Z- distribution has little area beyond it. But that same test statistic out on the fatter t-distribution has more fat  or area  beyond it, and that's exactly what the p-value represents. A bigger p-value means less chance of rejecting Ho. Having less data should create a higher burden of proof, so p-values do work the way you'd expect them to, after you figure out what you expect them to do!  Each t-distribution is distinguished by something statisticians call degrees of freedom.  Why they call it that is something that goes beyond this book.  When you're testing one population's mean and the sample size is n, the degrees of freedom for the corresponding t-distribution is n - 1. So, for example, if your sample size is 10, you use a t-distribution with 10 - 1 or 9 degrees of freedom, denoted t9, rather than a Z-distribution, to look up your test statistic.  For any test that uses the t- distribution, the degrees of freedom will be given in terms of a formula involving the sample sizes. See Chapter 15 for details.   Because each sample size would have to have its own t-distribution with its own t-table to find p- values, statisticians have come up with one abbreviated table that you can use to get a general feeling for your results  see Table 14-2 . Computers can also give you a precise p-value for any sample size.

This means you'll be looking at the row in the t-table  Table 14-2  that has a 9 in the Degrees of Freedom column. Your test statistic  2.5  falls between two values: 2.262  the 97.5th percentile  and 2.821  the 98th percentile . What's the p-value? Somewhere between 100% -  97.5% = 2.5% = 0.025 and 100% -  98% = 2% = 0.02.  Keep in mind that with a greater-than alternative, you need 100% minus the percentile.  You don't know exactly what the p-value is, but because 2% and 2.5 % are both less than the typical cutoff of 5%, you reject Ho. Note that for a less-than alternative hypothesis, your test statistic would be a negative number  to the   left of 0 on the t-distribution . In this case, you want to find the percentage below, or to the left of, your Table of Contents test statistic to get your p-value. Yet negative test statistics don't appear on Table 14-2. Not to worry! Statistics for Dummies The percentage to the left  below  a negative t-value is the same as the percentage to the right Introduction  above  the positive t-value, due to symmetry. So, to find the p-value for your negative test statistic, Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics look up the positive version of your test statistic on Table 14-2, find the corresponding percentile, and Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life take 100% minus that. Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade For example, if your test statistic is –2.5 with 9 degrees of freedom, look up +2.5 on Table 14-2, and Part II - Number-Crunching Basics you find that it falls between the 97.5th and 98th percentiles. Taking 100% minus these amounts, your Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs p-value is somewhere between 2% and 2.5%.  Note that this approach for negative numbers is Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More different from how these situations are handled in Table 8-1 in Chapter 8. But that table was set up Part III - Determining the Odds differently.  Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability If your alternative hypothesis  Ha  has the not-equal-to alternative, double the percentage that you get.

Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence  The t-table  Table 14-2  doesn't include all possible test statistics on it, so simply choose the one test statistic that's closest to yours, look at the column it's in, and find the corresponding percentile. Then figure your p-value.  HEADS UP   Intervals  The last line of Table 14-2 shows the corresponding values from the standard normal distribution  Z-distribution  for the given percentiles. Notice that as the degrees of freedom of the t-distribution increase  as you move down any given column , the numbers get closer and closer to that last row of the table. That confirms what you already know: As the sample size increases, the t- and the Z- distributions are more and more alike.

Chapter 15: Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples Overview   Whether in product advertisements or media blitzes on recent medical breakthroughs, you often run Table of Contents across claims made about one or more populations. For example, "We promise to deliver our Statistics for Dummies packages in two days or less" or, "Two recent studies show that a high-fiber diet may reduce your risk Introduction of colon cancer by 20%." Whenever someone makes a claim  also called a null hypothesis  about a Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics population  for example, that the average amount of time people spend commuting to and from work Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life is 6 hours per week, or that the percentage of people in the United States who like reality TV is 30% , Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong you can test the claim by doing what statisticians call a hypothesis test. You can also use a hypothesis test to compare two populations  for example, the mean commuting time for people working first shift Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade compared to people working second shift, or the proportion of women compared to men who have Part II - Number-Crunching Basics cellphones . See Chapter 14 for background information on the general ideas behind hypothesis tests. Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More A hypothesis test involves setting up your hypotheses  a claim and its alternative , selecting a sample Part III - Determining the Odds  or samples , collecting data, calculating the relevant statistics, and using those statistics to decide Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability whether the claim is true. What you're really doing is comparing your sample statistic to the claimed Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win population parameter and seeing how close they are to each other. For example, if the average Part IV - Wading through the Results commuting time for a sample of 1,000 workers is 5.2 hours, 5.2 is the sample statistic. If the claim is Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing that the average commuting time for the population of all workers is 6 hours per week, 6 is the claimed Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! population parameter, in this case, the population mean.

Testing One Population Mean This test is used when the variable is numerical  for example, age, income, time, and so on  and only one population or group is being studied  for example, all U.S. households or all college students . For example, Dr. Ruth says that the average time that working mothers spend talking to their children is 11 minutes per day, on average.  For dads, the claim is 8 minutes.  The variable, time, is numerical, and the population is all working mothers.   Table of Contents The null hypothesis is that the population mean, µ, is equal to a certain claimed value, µo. The notation Statistics for Dummies for the null hypothesis is Ho: µ=µ o. So, the null hypothesis in the Dr. Ruth example is Ho: µ = 11 minutes, and µo is 11 here. Note that µ represents the average number of minutes per day that all Introduction working mothers spend talking to their children, on average. The alternative hypothesis, Ha, is either µ, Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics > µ o, µ < µ o, or µ   µ o.In this example, the three possibilitiesfor Ha would be: µ > 11, µ < 11, or µ   Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong 11. See Chapter 14 for more on alternative hypotheses.  If you suspect that the average time working mothers spend talking with their kids is more than 11 minutes, your altenative hypothesis would be Ha: Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade µ > 11.

Divide +0.5 by 0.23, to get 2.17  rounded to 2.2 . That's your test statistic.  Divide your result from Step 2 by the standard error found in Step 3.  Take 2.3 divided by the square root of 100  which is 10  to get 0.23 for the standard error.  For the Dr. Ruth example, suppose a random sample of 100 working mothers spend an average of 11.5 minutes per day talking with their children, with a standard deviation of 2.3 minutes. That means x is 11.5, n = 100, and s = 2.3. Take 11.5 -  11 = +0.5.

Would Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey these sample results be unusual if the claim  Ho: µ = 11 minutes  were true? To decide whether your Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes test statistic supports Ho, calculate the p-value. To calculate the p-value, look up your test statistic  in Sources this case 2.2  on the standard normal distribution  Z-distribution  — see Table 8-1 in Chapter 8 — and Index take 100% minus the percentile shown, because your Ha is a greater-than hypothesis. In this case, the List of Figures percentage would be 100% -  98.61% = 1.39%. So, the p-value  dividing by 100  would be 0.0139. List of Tables  See Chapter 14 for more on p-value calculations.  This p-value of 0.0139  1.39%  is quite a bit less List of Sidebars than 0.05  5% . That means your sample results are unusual if the claim  of 11 minutes  is true. So, reject the claim  µ = 11 minutes  by rejecting Ho, and then accept Ha  µ > 11 minutes . Your conclusion: According to this  hypothetical  sample, Dr. Ruth's claim of 11 minutes is a bit low; the actual average is greater than 11 minutes per day. See Chapter 14 for more on hypothesis test calculations and conclusions.  HEADS UP   If the sample size, n, were less than 30 here, you would look up your test statistic on the t- distribution, rather than the standard normal distribution  Z-distribution . See Table 14-2 in Chapter 14 for more on this. For information on how to calculate p-values for the less- than or not-equal-to alternatives, also see Chapter 14.

Testing One Population Proportion This test is used when the variable is categorical  for example, gender, political party, support oppose, and so on  and only one population or group is being studied  for example, all U.S. citizens or all registered voters . The test is looking at the proportion  p  of individuals in the population who have a certain characteristic, for example, the proportion of people who carry cellphones. The null hypothesis is Ho: p = p 0, where p 0 is a certain claimed value. For example, if the claim is that 20% of people carry   cellphones, p 0 is 0.20. The alternative hypothesis is one of the following: p > p0, p < p 0, or p   p 0.  See Table of Contents Chapter 14 for more on alternative hypotheses.

Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence For example, suppose Cavifree toothpaste claims that four out of five dentists recommend Cavifree Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals toothpaste to their patients. In this case, the population is all dentists, and p is the proportion of all Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples dentists who recommended Cavifree to their patients. The claim is that p is equal to "four out of five", Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test which means that p0 is 4 ÷ 5 = 0.80. You suspect that the proportion is actually less than 0.80. Your Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions hypotheses are Ho: p = 0.80 versus H a: p < 0.80. Suppose that 150 out of 200 dental patients sampled Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples received a recommendation for Cavifree. Part VII - Statistical Studies—The Inside Scoop To find the test statistic, start with  Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? Take 0.75 -  0.80 = - 0.05. Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations Next, the standard error is the square root of [ 0.80 × [1 -  0.80]  ÷ 200] = the square root of  0.16 Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control Part VIII - The Part of Tens ÷ 200  = the square root of 0.0008 = 0.028. Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey The test statistic is - 0.05 divided by 0.028, which is - 0.05 ÷ 0.028 = - 1.79, rounded to - 1.8. Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes Sources This means that your sample results are 1.8 standard errors below the claimed value for the Index population. List of Figures How often would you expect to get results like this if Ho were true? The percentage chance of being at List of Tables or beyond  in this case to the left of   - 1.8, is 3.59%.  Look up - 1.8 in Table 8-1 in Chapter 8 and use List of Sidebars the corresponding percentile, because Ha is a less-than hypothesis. See Chapter 14 for more on this.  Now divide by 100 to get your p-value, which is 0.0359. Because the p-value is less than 0.05, you have enough evidence to reject Ho. According to your sample, the claim of four out of five  80% of  dentists recommending Cavifree toothpaste is not true; the actual percentage of recommendations is less than that.   is 150 ÷ 200 = 0.75. Also, p0 = 0.80 and n = 200.  Intervals  HEADS UP   Most hypothesis tests involving proportions are done using samples that are quite large, given that they're most often based on surveys, so you rarely encounter a situation in which a very small sample is used.

Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence For example, suppose you want to compare the absorbency of two brands of paper towels  call the brands Stats-absorbent and Sponge-o-matic . You can make this comparison by looking at the Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals average number of ounces each brand can absorb before being saturated.

Here, you have no indication of which paper towel may Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions be more absorbent, so the not-equal-to alternative is the one to use.  See Chapter 14.  Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples Part VII - Statistical Studies—The Inside Scoop Suppose you select a random sample of 50 paper towels from each brand and measure the Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls absorbency of each paper towel. Suppose the average absorbency of Stats-absorbent  x  is 3 ounces, Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? with a standard deviation of 0.9 ounces, and for Sponge-o-matic  y , the average absorbency is 3.5 Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations ounces, with a standard deviation of 1.2 ounces. Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control Part VIII - The Part of Tens Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes Sources Index List of Figures List of Tables List of Sidebars  Given these data, you have x = 3, sx = 0.9, y = 3.5, sy = 1.2, n1 = 50, and n2 = 50.

To find the p-value, look up - 2.4 on the standard normal distribution  Z-distribution  — see Table 8-1 in Chapter 8. The chance of being beyond, in this case to the left of, - 2.4 is equal to the percentile, which is 0.82%. Because Ha is a not-equal-to alternative, you double this percentage to get 2 × 0.82% = 1.64%. Finally, change this to a probability by dividing by 100 to get a p-value of 0.0164. This p-value is less than 0.05. That means you do have enough evidence to reject Ho. Your conclusion is that a statistically significant difference exists between the absorbency levels of these two brands of paper towels, based on your samples. And it looks like Sponge-o-matic comes out on top, because it has a higher average.   HEADS UP   Being the savvy statistician you are, don't fall for those commercials that show one single sheet from one single roll of paper towels  that is, a sample size of 1  being more absorbent than another. And don't give credibility to those morning TV news shows that send producers on the street asking two or three people for information and making comparisons. Anecdotes are interesting, but they can't be generalized. A hypothesis test, done right, gives results that are both interesting and can be generalized.

Testing for an Average Difference  Paired Data  This test is used when the variable is numerical  for example, income, cholesterol level, or miles per gallon , and the individuals in the sample are either paired up in some way  identical twins are often used  or the same people are used twice  for example, using a pre-test and post-test . Paired tests are typically used for studies in which they're testing to see whether a new treatment, technique, or method works better than an existing method, without having to worry about other factors about the subjects   that may influence the results. See Chapter 17 for details. Table of Contents Statistics for Dummies For example, suppose a researcher wants to see whether teaching students to read using a computer Introduction game gives better results than teaching with a tried-and-true phonics method. She randomly selects Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics 20 students and puts them into 10 pairs according to their reading readiness level, age, IQ, and so on. Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life She randomly selects one student from each pair to learn to read via the computer game, and the Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong other learns to read using the phonics method.

So, you take the difference between the scores for each pair, and those paired differences make up your new set of data to work with. If the two reading methods are the same, the average of the paired differences should be 0. If the computer method is better, the average of the paired differences should be positive    because the computer reading score should be larger than the phonics score . So you really have a hypothesis test for one population mean, where the null hypothesis is that the mean  of the paired differences  is 0, and the alternative hypothesis is that the mean  of the paired differences  is > 0. The notation for the null hypothesis is H0: µ  d = 0, where µd is the mean of the paired differences.

Comparing Two Population Proportions This test is used when the variable is categorical  for example, smoker  nonsmoker, political party, support oppose an opinion, and so on  and you're interested in the proportion of individuals with a certain characteristic — for example, the proportion of smokers. In this case, two populations or groups are being compared  such as the proportion of female smokers versus male smokers .

The Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? claims may sound too good to be true, but when you turn the page to the back of the ad, you see all Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations the fine print where the drug company justifies how it's able to make its claims.  This is typically where Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control statistics are buried!  Somewhere in the tiny print, you'll likely find a table that shows adverse effects of Part VIII - The Part of Tens the drug when compared to a control group  subjects who take a fake drug, for fair comparison to Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey those who actually took the real drug. See Chapter 17 for more on this . For example Adderall, a drug Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  ADHD , reported that 26 of the 374 subjects  7%  who took Sources the drug experienced vomiting as a side effect, compared to 8 of the 210 subjects  4%  who were on a Index placebo  fake drug . Note that patients didn't know which treatment they were given. In the sample, List of Figures more people on the drug experienced vomiting, but is this percentage enough to say that the entire List of Tables population would experience more vomiting? You can test it to see. List of Sidebars In this example, you have Ho: p 1 -  p 2 = 0 versus Ho: p 1 -  p 2 > 0, where p 1 represents the proportion of subjects who vomited using Adderall, and p2 represents the proportion of subjects who vomited using the placebo.  TECHNICAL STUFF   Why does Ha contain a ">" sign and not a "<" sign? Ha represents the scenario in which those taking Adderall experience more vomiting than those on placebo — that's something the FDA would want to know about. But the order of the groups is important, too. You want to set it up so the Adderall group is first, so that when you take the Adderall proportion minus the placebo proportion, you get a positive number if Ha is true. If you switch the groups, the sign would have been negative.  The next step is calculating the test statistic:   . The sample sizes are n1 = 374 and n2 = 210,   and   First,  respectively. Next, take the difference between these sample proportions to get 0.07 -  0.04 = 0.03.

See Table 8-1 of Chapter 8.  Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong This p-value is just a shade over 0.05, so, technically, you don't have quite enough evidence to reject Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade Ho.

Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence  A p-value that is very close to that magical but somewhat arbitrary cut-off of 0.05 is what statisticians call a marginal result. In the preceding example, the p-value of 0.0668 is generally viewed as a marginal result. It means the result is right on the borderline between accepting and rejecting Ho. That's the beauty of reporting a p-value, though; you can look at it and decide for yourself what you should conclude. The smaller the p-value, the more evidence you have against Ho, but how much evidence is enough evidence? Each person is different. If you come across a report from a study in which someone found a statistically significant result, and that result is important to you, ask for the p-value so that you can make your own decision.

The target population is the Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? entire group of individuals that you're interested in drawing conclusions about. In most situations, Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations surveying the entire target population is impossible because researchers would have to spend too Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control much time or money to do so.  When you do a survey of the entire target population, that's called a Part VIII - The Part of Tens census.  Usually, the best you can do is to select a sample of individuals from the target population, Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey survey those individuals, then draw conclusions about the target population based on the data from Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes that sample. Sources Sounds easy, right? Wrong. Many potential problems arise after you realize that you can't survey Index everyone in the entire target population. Unfortunately many surveys are conducted without taking the List of Figures time needed to think through these issues, and this results in errors, misleading results, and wrong List of Tables conclusions. List of Sidebars Stating the purpose of the survey This sounds like it should just be common sense, but in reality, many surveys have been designed and carried out that never met their purpose, or that met only some of the objectives, but not all of them. Getting lost in the questions and forgetting what you're really trying to find out is easy to do. In stating the purpose of a survey, be as specific as possible. Think about the types of conclusions you would want to make if you were to write a report, and let that help you determine your goals for the survey.

Defining the target population Suppose, for example, that you want to conduct a survey to determine the extent to which people engage in personal e-mail usage in the workplace. You may think that the target population is e-mail users in the workplace. However, you want to determine the extent to which e-mail is used in the workplace, so you can't just ask e-mail users, or your results would be biased against those who don't use e-mail in the workplace. But should you also include those who don't even have access to a computer during their workday?  See how fast surveys can get tricky?

Your definition is what  helps you select the proper sample, and it also guides you in your conclusions, so that you don't over-generalize your results. If the researcher didn't clearly define the target population, this can be a sign of other problems with the survey.    The target population that probably makes the most sense here is all of the people who use Internet- Table of Contents connected computers in the workplace. Everyone in this group at least has access to e-mail, though Statistics for Dummies only some of those with access to e-mail in the workplace actually use it, and of those who use it, only Introduction some use it for personal e-mail.

The way that the questions are asked can make Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls a huge difference in the quality of the data that will be collected. One of the single most common Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? sources of bias in surveys is the wording of the questions. Leading questions  questions that are Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations designed to favor a certain response over another  can greatly affect how people answer the Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control questions, and these responses may not accurately reflect how the respondents truly feel about an Part VIII - The Part of Tens issue.

Don't you think we should stop increasing the burden on the taxpayers and stop asking for yet another sales tax hike to fund the wasteful school system?  Intervals  From the wording of each of these leading questions, you can easily see how the pollster wants you to respond. Research shows that the wording of the question does affect the outcome of surveys. The best way to word a question is in a neutral way. For this example, the question should be worded like this:  The school district is proposing a 0.01% increase in sales tax to provide funds for a new high school to be built in the district. What's your opinion on the proposed sales tax?  Possible responses: strongly in favor, in favor, neutral, against, strongly against.    In a good survey, the questions are always worded in a neutral way in order to avoid bias. The best way to assess the neutrality of a question is to ask yourself whether you can tell how the person wants you to respond by reading the question. If the answer is yes, that question is a leading question and can give misleading results.

Current events shape people's opinions all the time, and Table of Contents whereas some pollsters try to determine how people feel about those events, others take advantage of Statistics for Dummies events, especially negative ones, and use them as political platforms or as fodder for headlines and Introduction controversy. The timing of any survey can also cause bias, regardless of the subject matter. For Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics example, suppose your target population for a survey is people who work full time. If you conduct a Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life telephone survey to get office workers' opinions on personal e-mail use at work, and you call them at Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong home between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., you're going to have bias in your results, because those Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade are the hours when the majority of office workers are at work.

Because typically you don't have time or money to conduct a census  a survey of the entire target population  you need to select a subset of the population, called a sample. How this sample is Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence selected can make all the difference in terms of the accuracy and the quality of the results. Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence Three criteria are important in selecting a good sample: Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples Part VII - Statistical Studies—The Inside Scoop Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results?

To represent the target population, the sample must be selected from the target population, the whole target population, and nothing but the target population. Suppose you want to find out how many hours of TV Americans watch in a day, on average. Asking students in a dorm at a local university to record their TV viewing habits isn't going to cut it. Students represent only a portion of the target population. Asking people to call in their opinions on a radio show is not going to give you a sample that represents the target population; the results will represent only the people who were listening to the show, were able to call at the appropriate time, and felt strongly enough about the issue to make the effort to call in. Likewise, a Web survey will represent only the people who have access to the Internet and who logged on to the site where the survey was posted.  Unfortunately, many people who conduct surveys don't take the time or spend the money to select a representative sample of people to participate in the study, and this leads to biased survey results. When presented with survey results, find out how the sample was selected before examining the results of the survey.  A good sample is selected randomly. A random sample is one in which every member of the target population has an equal chance of being selected. The easiest example to visualize here is that of a hat  or bucket  containing individual slips of paper, each with the name of a person written on it; if the slips are thoroughly mixed before each slip of paper is drawn out, the result will be a random sample of the target population  in this case, the population of people whose names are in the hat . A random sample eliminates bias in the sampling process.  HEADS UP   Intervals  Reputable polling organizations, such as The Gallup Organization, use a random digit dialing procedure to telephone the members of their sample. Of course, this excludes people without telephones, but because most American households today have at least one telephone, the bias involved in excluding people without telephones is relatively small.   HEADS UP   Beware of surveys that have a large sample size but where that sample is not randomly selected. Internet surveys are the biggest culprit. Someone can say that Statistics For Dummies 50,000 people logged on to a Web site to answer a survey, and that means that the by Deborah Rumsey  Webmaster of this site has a lot of information. But that information is biased, because John Wiley & Sons   2003  356 pages  it doesn't represent the opinions of anyone except those who knew about the survey, This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, chose to participate in it, and had access to the Internet.

Note that in cases where not everyone responded, you should replace the sample size with the number of respondents. See the "Following up, following up, and following up" section later in this chapter.   A good sample is large enough for the results to be accurate. If you have a large sample size, and if the sample is representative of the target population and is selected at random, you can count on that information being pretty accurate. How accurate depends on the sample size, but the bigger the sample size, the more accurate the information will be  as long as that information is good information . The accuracy of most survey questions is measured in terms of a percentage. This percentage is called the margin of error, and it represents how much the researcher expects the results to vary if he or she were to repeat the survey many times using different samples of the same size.

List of Sidebars Following up, following up, and following up Anyone who has ever thrown away a survey or refused to "answer a few questions" over the phone knows that getting people to participate in a survey isn't easy. If the researcher wants to minimize bias, the best way to handle this is to get as many folks to respond as possible by following up, one, two, or even three times. Offer dollar bills, coupons, self-addressed stamped return envelopes, chances to win prizes, and so on. Every little bit helps.  What has ever motivated you to fill out a survey? If the incentive provided by the researcher didn't persuade you  or that feeling of guilt for just taking those two shiny quarters and dumping the survey in the trash didn't get to you  maybe the subject matter peaked your interest. This is where bias comes in.   ISBN:0764554239  If only those folks who feel very strongly respond to a survey, that means that only their opinions will count, because the other people who didn't really care about the issue didn't respond, and their "I don't care" vote didn't get counted. Or maybe they did care, but they just didn't take the time to tell anyone. Statistics For Dummies Either way, their vote doesn't count. by Deborah Rumsey  John Wiley & Sons   2003  356 pages  This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life.  For example, suppose 1,000 people are given a survey about whether the park rules should be changed to allow dogs on leashes. Who would respond? Most likely, the respondents would be those who strongly agree or disagree with the proposed rules. Suppose 100 people from each of the two sides of the issue were the only respondents. That would mean that 800 opinions were not counted. Suppose none of those 800 people really cared about the issue either way. If you could count their   Table of Contents opinions, the results would be 800 ÷ 1,000 = 80% "no opinion", 100 ÷ 1,000 = 10% in favor of the new rules and 100 ÷ 1,000 = 10% against the new rules. But without the votes of the 800 non-respondents, Statistics for Dummies the researchers would report, "Of the people who responded, 50% were in favor of the new rules and Introduction 50% were against them." This gives the impression of a very different  and a very biased  result from Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics the one you would've gotten if all 1,000 people had responded.

Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence  A study published in the Journal of Applied Social Psychology  concluded that when lying to someone is in the best interest of the person hearing the lie, lying becomes more socially acceptable, and when lying to someone is in the best interest of the liar himself herself, the lying becomes less socially acceptable. This sounds interesting and seems to make sense, but can this be true of everyone? The way the results are stated, this appears to be the case. However, in looking at the people who actually participated in the survey leading to these results, you begin to get the feeling that the conclusions may be a bit ambitious, to say the least.  The authors started out with 1,105 women who were selected to participate in the survey. Of these, 659 refused to cooperate, most of them saying they didn't have time. Another 233 were determined by the researchers to be either "too young" or "too old", and 33 were deemed unsuitable because the researchers sited a language barrier. In the end, 180 women were questioned. The average age of the final group of participants was 34.8 years.  Lying: What do they know?  Intervals  Wow, where do I start with this one? The original sample size of 1,105 seems large enough, but were they selected randomly? Notice that the entire sample consisted of women, which is interesting, because the conclusions don't say that lies are more or less acceptable according to women in these situations. Next, 659 of those selected to participate refused to cooperate  causing bias . This is a large percentage  60% , but given the subject matter, you shouldn't be surprised. The researchers could have minimized the problem by guaranteeing that the responses would be anonymous, for example. No information is given regarding whether any follow-up was done  which probably means that it wasn't .

If that had been the case, the conclusions should have been made about that age group only. Finally, the last straw: throwing out 33 people who were "unsuitable"  in the researchers' own terms  because of a language barrier. I'd say, "Bring in an interpreter", because the conclusions were not limited to only those who speak English. You can't have the survey participants represent only a tiny microcosm of society  young women who speak English , and then turn around and make conclusions about all of society, based only on the data from this tiny microcosm. Starting out with a sample size of 1,105 and ending up with only 180 women is just plain bad statistics.  HEADS UP   The response rate of a survey is a ratio found by taking the number of respondents divided by the number of people who were originally asked to participate. Statisticians feel that a good response rate is anything over 70%. However, many response rates fall far short of that, unless the survey is done by a reputable organization, such as The Gallup Organization. Look for the response rate when examining survey results. If the response rate is too low  much less than 70%  the results may be biased and should be ignored. Don't be fooled by a survey that claims to have a large number of respondents but actually has a low response rate; in this case, many people may have responded, but many more were asked and didn't respond.   ISBN:0764554239  Note that many statistical formulas  including the formulas in this book  assume that your sample size is equal to the number of respondents, because statisticians want you to know how important it is to follow up with people and not end up with biased data due to non-response. However, in reality, statisticians know that you can't always get everyone to respond, no matter how hard you try. So, which number do you put in for n in all the formulas: the intended sample size  the number of people contacted  or the actual sample size  the number of people who responded ? Use the number of people who responded. Note, however, that for any survey with a low response rate, the results shouldn't be reported, because they very well could be biased. That's how important following up really is.  Do other people heed this warning when they report their results to you? Not often enough.   Statistics For Dummies by Deborah Rumsey  John Wiley & Sons   2003  356 pages  This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life.  REMEMBER Regarding the quality of results, selecting a smaller initial sample size and following them up more aggressively is a much better approach than selecting a larger group of potential respondents and having a low response rate.

Numerical data, such as income, have different characteristics and are usually presented differently than categorical data, such as gender.  For more information on how data can be Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals organized and summarized, see Chapters 4 and 5  respectively . Depending on the research question, Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples different types of analyses can be performed on the data, including coming up with population Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test estimates, testing a hypothesis about the population, or looking for relationships, to name a few.

You could try to encourage people to respond by letting them know that their privacy would be protected during and after the survey.  Watch for misleading graphs and statistics. Not all survey data are organized and analyzed fairly and correctly. See Chapter 2 for more about how statistics can go wrong.  When you report the results of a survey, you generally don't tie the information collected to the names of the respondents, because doing so would violate the privacy of the respondents. You've probably heard the terms "anonymous" and "confidential" before, but what you may not realize is that these two words are completely different in terms of privacy issues. Keeping results confidential means that I could tie your information to your name in my report, but I promise that I won't do that. Keeping results anonymous means that I have no way of tying your information to your name in my report, even if I wanted to.  Anonymity versus confidentiality  HEADS UP   HEADS UP   Intervals  If you're asked to participate in a survey, be sure you're clear about what the researchers plan to do with your responses and whether or not your name can be tied to the survey.  Good surveys always make this issue very clear for you.  Then make a decision as to whether you still wish to participate.

Drawing conclusions The conclusions are the best part of any survey; this is why the researchers do all of the work in the first place. If the survey was designed and carried out properly, the sample was selected carefully — and the data were organized and summarized correctly — the results will fairly and accurately represent the reality of the target population. But, of course, not all surveys are done right. But even if a survey is done correctly, researchers can misinterpret or over-interpret results so that they say more   than they really should. You know the saying, "Seeing is believing"? Some researchers are guilty of the Table of Contents converse, which is, "Believing is seeing." In other words, they claim to see what they want to believe Statistics for Dummies about the results. All the more reason for you to know where the line is drawn between reasonable Introduction conclusions and misleading results, and to realize when others have crossed that line. Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life Here are some of the most common errors made in drawing conclusions from surveys: Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade Part II - Number-Crunching Basics Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More Part III - Determining the Odds Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win Part IV - Wading through the Results Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary!

The survey was based on 300 Web users selected from a group of 30,000 technology panelists who worked for Intelliquest.  Note that this is not a random sample of Web users!

Intervals  Excite claimed that it was better than Yahoo! based on this survey. The actual results, however, tell a different story. The average overall quality score, on a scale of 0 to 100%, was 89% for Excite and 87% for Yahoo!. Excite's score is admittedly good, and it is slightly higher than the score obtained for Yahoo!; however, the difference between the results for the two companies are actually well within the margin of error for this survey, which is plus or minus 3.5%. In other words, Excite and Yahoo! were in a statistical tie for first place. So saying which company actually came in first isn't possible in this case.  See Chapters 9 and 10 for more on sample variation and the margin or error.

List of Figures List of Tables List of Sidebars  That way, you'll be less likely to be influenced by the results you're reading, if, in fact, the results aren't based on a scientific survey. Now that you know what a scientific survey  the media's term for an accurate and unbiased survey  actually involves, you can use those criteria to judge for yourself whether the survey results are credible.  Look for disclaimers about surveys before reading the results, if you can.  3.  Be on the lookout for statistically incorrect conclusions.  If someone reports a difference between two groups in terms of survey results, be sure that the difference is larger than the reported margin of error. If the difference is within the margin of error, you should expect the sample results to vary by that much just by chance, and the so- called "difference" can't really be generalized to the entire population.  See Chapter 14 for more on this.  Tune out anyone who says, "These results aren't scientific, but…."  4.   4.  HEADS UP   Here's the bottom line about surveys. Know the limitations of any survey and be wary of any information coming from surveys in which those limitations aren't respected. A bad survey is cheap and easy to do, but you get what you pay for. Before looking at the results of any survey, investigate how it was designed and conducted, so that you can judge the quality of the results.

Chapter 17: Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? Medical breakthroughs seem to come and go quickly in today's age of information. One day, you hear about a promising new treatment for a disease, only to find out later that the drug didn't live up to expectations in the last stage of testing. Pharmaceutical companies bombard TV viewers with   commercials for pills, sending millions of people to their doctors clamoring for the latest and greatest Table of Contents cures for their ills, sometimes without even knowing what the drugs are for. Anyone can search the Statistics for Dummies Internet for details about any type of ailment, disease, or symptom and come up with tons of Introduction information and advice.

Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error Although many different types of studies exist, you can boil them all down to basically two different types: experiments and observational studies. This section examines what, exactly, makes experiments Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence different from other studies. Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence An observational study is just what it sounds like: a study in which the researcher merely observes the Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals subjects and records the information. No intervention takes place, no changes are introduced, and no Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples restrictions or controls are imposed. An experiment is a study that doesn't simply observe subjects in Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test their natural state, but deliberately applies treatments to them in a controlled situation and records the Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions outcomes. Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples Part VII - Statistical Studies—The Inside Scoop Examining experiments Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? The basic goal of an experiment is to find out whether a particular treatment causes a change in the Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations response.  The operative word here is "cause."  The way an experiment does this is by creating a very Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control controlled environment — so controlled that the researcher can pinpoint whether a certain factor or Part VIII - The Part of Tens combination of factors causes a change in the response variable, and if so, the extent to which that Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey factor  or that combination of factors  influences the response. Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes Sources For example, in order to gain government approval for a proposed drug, pharmaceutical researchers Index set up experiments to determine whether that drug helps lower blood pressure, what dosage level is List of Figures most appropriate for each different population of patients, what side effects  if any  occur, and to what List of Tables extent those side effects occur in each population. List of Sidebars Observing observational studies In certain situations, observational studies are the optimal way to go. The most common observational studies are polls and surveys  see Chapter 16 . When the goal is simply to find out what people think and to collect some demographic information  such as gender, age, income, and so on , surveys and polls can't be beat, as long as they're designed and conducted correctly.  Intervals  In other situations, especially those looking for cause-and-effect relationships  discussed in detail in Chapter 18 , observational studies aren't appropriate. For example, suppose you took a couple of Vitamin C pills last week; is that what helped you avoid getting that cold that's going around the office? Maybe the extra sleep you got recently or the extra hand-washing you've been doing helped you ward   off the cold. Or maybe you just got lucky this time. With so many variables in the mix, how can you tell which one had an influence on the outcome of your not getting a cold?  HEADS UP   When looking at the results of any study, first determine what the purpose of the study was and whether the type of study fits the purpose. For example, if an observational study was done instead of an experiment in order to establish a cause-and-effect relationship  see Chapter 18 , any conclusions that are drawn should be carefully scrutinized.

Sources HEADS Index UP  List of Figures List of Tables List of Sidebars  Be wary of research conclusions that find significant results based on small sample sizes  especially samples much smaller than 30 . If the results are important to you, ask for a copy of the research report and look to see what type of analysis was done on the data. Also look at the sample of subjects to see whether this sample truly represents the population about which the researchers are drawing conclusions.  Intervals  Checking your definition of "sample size" When asking questions about sample sizes, be specific about what you mean by sample size. For example, you can ask how many subjects were selected to participate and also ask for the number who actually completed the experiment; these two numbers can be very different. Make sure the researchers can explain any situations in which the research subjects decided to drop out or were unable  for some reason  to finish the experiment.  For example, an article in the New York Times entitled "Marijuana Is Called an Effective Relief in Cancer Therapy" says in the opening paragraph that marijuana is "far more effective" than any other   drug in relieving the side effects of chemotherapy. When you get into the details, you find out that the results are based on only 29 patients  15 on the treatment, 14 on a placebo . To add to the confusion, you find out that only 12 of the 15 patients in the treatment group actually completed the study; so what happened to the other three subjects?  Statistics For Dummies by Deborah Rumsey  John Wiley & Sons   2003  356 pages  This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life.  Sometimes, researchers draw their conclusions based on only those subjects who completed the study.

Table of Contents Statistics for Dummies Introduction Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics Choosing the subjects Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong The first step in designing an experiment is selecting the sample of participants, called the research Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade subjects. Although researchers would like for their subjects to be selected randomly from their Part II - Number-Crunching Basics respective populations, in most cases, this just isn't feasible. For example, suppose a group of eye Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs researchers wants to test out a new laser surgery on nearsighted people. They need a random sample Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More of subjects, so they randomly select various eye doctors from across the country and randomly select Part III - Determining the Odds nearsighted patients from these doctors' files. They call up each person selected and say, "We're Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability experimenting with a new laser surgery treatment for nearsightedness, and you've been selected at Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win random to participate in our study. When can you come in for the surgery?" Part IV - Wading through the Results Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing Something tells me that this approach wouldn't go over very well with many people receiving the call Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary!  although some would probably jump at the chance, especially if they didn't have to pay for the Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error procedure . The point is, getting a truly random sample of people to participate in an experiment is generally more difficult than getting a random sample of folks to participate in a survey. Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence  Intervals  Volunteering can have side effects  The U.S. National Institutes of Health has a Web site  http:  www.clinicaltrials.gov  providing current information about clinical research studies.  In order to find subjects for their experiments, researchers often advertise for volunteers and offer them incentives such as money, free treatments, or follow-up care for their participation. Medical research on humans is complicated and difficult, but it's necessary in order to really know whether a treatment works, how well it works, what the dosage should be, and what the side effects are. In order to prescribe the right treatments in the right amounts in real-life situations, doctors and patients depend on these studies being representative of the general population. In order to recruit such representative subjects, researchers have to do a broad advertisement campaign and select enough participants with enough different characteristics to represent a cross-section of the populations of folks who will be prescribed these treatments in the future.

Realizing the importance of random assignment Suppose a researcher wants to determine the effects of exercise on heart rate. The subjects in his treatment group run five miles and have their heart rates measured before and after the run. The subjects in his control group will sit on the couch the whole time and watch reruns of The Simpsons. Which group would you rather be in? Some of the health nuts out there would no doubt volunteer for the treatment group. If you're not crazy about the idea of running five miles, you may opt for the easy   way out and volunteer to be a couch potato.  Or maybe you hate The Simpsons so much that you'd even run five miles to avoid watching an episode.  What impact would this selective volunteering have on the results of the study? If only the health nuts  who probably already have excellent heart rates  volunteer to be in the treatment group, the researcher will be looking only at the effect of the treatment  running five miles  on very healthy and active people. He won't see the effect that running five miles has on the heart rates of couch potatoes. This non-random assignment of subjects to the treatment and control group could have a huge impact on the conclusions he draws from this study.

This particular study, in which 12,000 pregnant women with HIV in Africa, Thailand, and the Dominican Republic participated, had a deadly design. Researchers gave half of the women various dosages of AZT, but the other half of the women received sugar pills.

For example, one news headline boasted, "Study links older mothers, long life." The opening paragraph said that women who have a first baby after age 40 have a much better chance of living to be 100, compared to women who have a first baby at an earlier age.

This so-called "control group" lived to be exactly 73, no more and no less.

Part III - Determining the Odds Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability How do researchers handle confounding variables? The operative word is "control."

Double-blind means that neither the subjects nor the researchers know who got what treatment or who is in the control group. The research subjects need to be oblivious to which treatment they're getting so that the researchers can measure the placebo effect. But why shouldn't the researcher know who got what treatment? So that they don't treat subjects differently by either expecting  or not expecting  certain responses from certain groups. For example, if a researcher knows you're in the treatment group to study the side effects of a new drug, she may expect you to get sick and pay more attention to you than if she knew you were in the control group. This can result in biased data and misleading results.  Before believing any medical headlines  or any headlines for that matter , look to see how the study was conducted. Observational studies can't control for confounding variables, so their results are not as statistically meaningful  no matter what the statistics say  as the results of a well-designed experiment. In cases where an experiment can't be done  after all, no one can force you to have a baby after or before age 40 , make sure the observational study is based on a large enough sample that represents a cross-section of the population.  HEADS UP   Intervals  If the researcher knows who got what treatment but the subjects don't know, the study is called a blind study  rather than a double-blind study .

Statisticians use three criteria for evaluating data quality; each of the   criteria really relates most strongly to the quality of the measurement instrument that's used in the Table of Contents process of collecting the data. Statistics for Dummies To decide whether or not you're looking at good data from an experiment, look for these Introduction characteristics: Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade Part II - Number-Crunching Basics Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More Part III - Determining the Odds Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win Part IV - Wading through the Results Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary!

Find out how the data were collected when examining the results of an experiment. If the measurements are unreliable, the data could be inaccurate.  Unbiased  the data contain no systematic errors that either add to or subtract from the true values : Biased data are data that systematically over measure or under measure the true result. Bias can occur almost anywhere during the design or implementation of a study. Bias can be caused by a bad measurement instrument  like a bathroom scale that's "always" five pounds over  by survey questions that lead participants in a certain way, or by researchers who know what treatment each subject received and have preconceived expectations.  Bias is probably the number-one problem in data. And worse yet, it can't really be measured.  For example, the margin of error doesn't measure bias. See Chapter 10 for details on the margin of error.  However, steps can be taken to minimize bias, as discussed in Chapter 16 and in the "Randomly assigning subjects to groups" section earlier in this chapter.

You have to ask the question: Do these data measure what they should be measuring? Or should the researchers have been collecting altogether different data? The appropriateness of the measurement instrument used is important. For example, asking students to report their high school math grades may not be a valid measure of actual grades. A more valid measure would be to look at each student's transcript. Measuring the prevalence of crime by the number of crimes is not valid; the crime rate  number of crimes per capita  should be used.  Be aware of the many ways that bias can come into play during the design or implementation of any study, and evaluate the study with an eye toward detecting bias. If a study contains a great deal of bias, you have to ignore the results.

Be sure the researchers are collecting data that are appropriate for the goals of the study.  Analyzing the data properly After the data have been collected, they're put into that mysterious box called the statistical analysis. The choice of analysis is just as important  in terms of the quality of the results  as any other aspect of   a study. A proper analysis should be planned in advance, during the design phase of the experiment. That way, after the data are collected, you won't run into any major problems during the analysis.

Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals Overstating the results Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test Many times, the headlines in the media will overstate actual research results. When you read a Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions headline or otherwise hear about a study, be sure to look further to find out the details of how the study Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples was done and exactly what the conclusions were. Part VII - Statistical Studies—The Inside Scoop Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls Press releases often overstate results, too. For example, in a recent press release by the National Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? Institute for Drug Abuse, the researchers claimed that Ecstasy use was down in 2002 from 2001. Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations However, when you look at the actual statistical results in the report, you find that the percentage of Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control teens in the sample who said they'd used Ecstasy was lower in 2002 than it was in 2001, but this Part VIII - The Part of Tens difference was not found to be statistically significant  even though many other results were found to Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey be statistically significant . This means that although fewer teens in the sample used Ecstasy in 2002, Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes the difference wasn't enough to account for more than chance variability from sample to sample.  See Chapter 14 for more about statistical significance.  Sources Index Headlines and leading paragraphs in press releases and newspaper articles often overstate the actual List of Figures results of a study. Big results, spectacular findings, and major breakthroughs are what make the news List of Tables these days, and reporters and others in the media are constantly pushing the envelope in terms of List of Sidebars what is and is not newsworthy. How can you sort out the truth from exaggeration? The best thing to do is to read the fine print. Taking the results one step beyond the actual data A study that links having children later in life to longer lifespans illustrates another point about research results. Do the results of this observational study mean that having a baby later in life can make you live longer? "No", said the researchers. Their explanation of the results was that having a baby later in life may be due to women having a "slower" biological clock, which presumably would then result in the aging process being slowed down.  Intervals  My question to these researchers is, "Then why didn't you study that, instead of just looking at their   ISBN:0764554239  HEADS UP   ages?" I don't see any data in this study that would lead me to conclude that women who had children after age 40 aged at a slower rate than other women, so in my view, the researchers shouldn't make that conclusion yet. Or the researchers should state clearly that this view is only a theory and requires further study. Based on the data in this study, the researchers' theory seems like a leap of faith  although as a 41-year-old new mom, I'll hope for the best! .

Frequently, in a press release or news article, the researcher will give an explanation about why he thinks the results of the study turned out the way they did and what implications these results have for society as a whole.  These explanations may have been in response to a reporter's questions about the research, questions that were later edited out of the story, leaving only the juicy quotes from the researcher.  Many of these after-the-fact explanations are no more than theories that have yet to be tested. In such cases, you should be wary of conclusions, explanations, or links drawn by researchers that aren't backed up by their studies.

Making Informed Decisions about Experiments Just because someone says they conducted a "scientific study" or a "scientific experiment", doesn't mean it was done right or that the results are credible. Unfortunately, I've come across a lot of bad experiments in my days as a statistical consultant. The worst part is that if an experiment was done poorly, you can't do anything about it after the fact except ignore the results — and that's exactly what you need to do.   Table of Contents Here are some tips that help you make an informed decision about whether to believe the results of an Statistics for Dummies experiment, especially one whose results are very important to you.

Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence  Carefully scrutinize the conclusions that the researcher makes regarding his or her findings. Many researchers tend to overstate results, make conclusions beyond the statistical evidence, or try to apply their results to a broader population than the one they studied.  Go through the report and evaluate the experiment according to the eight steps for a good experiment described in the "Designing a Good Experiment" section of this chapter.  You really don't have to understand everything written in a report in order to do that.   Never be afraid to ask questions of the media, the researchers, and even your own experts. For example, if you have a question about a medical study, ask your doctor. He or she will be glad that you're an empowered and well-informed patient!  Follow up on your sources until you find the person who did the original research, and then ask them for a copy of the report or paper.

Part IV - Wading through the Results Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing To make sense out of any data, you should first organize them using a table, chart, or graph  see Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! Chapter 4 . When the data are bivariate and you're looking for links between the two variables, the charts and graphs need to have two dimensions to them as well, just like the data do.

A Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions scatterplot has two dimensions, a horizontal dimension  called the x-axis  and a vertical dimension Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples  called the y-axis . Both axes are numerical; each one contains a number line. Part VII - Statistical Studies—The Inside Scoop Making a scatterplot Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? Placing observations  or points  on a scatterplot is similar to finding a city on a map that uses letters Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations and numbers to mark off sections of the map.

If the data don't seem to resemble any kind of line  even a vague one , this means that no linear relationship exists.  If the data resemble a downhill line as you move from left to right, this indicates a negative linear  or inverse  relationship. That means that as x increases  moves right one unit , y decreases  moves down  a certain amount.  If the data resemble an uphill line as you move from left to right, this indicates a positive linear  or proportional  relationship.

That is, as the cricket chirps increase, the temperature increases, as well. Is this a cause-and-effect relationship  in other words, do temperature increases cause Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples crickets to chirp faster ? That remains to be seen, because these data come only from an Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test observational study, not an experiment  see Chapter 17 .

However, just because your graph or chart shows that something is going on, it doesn't mean that a cause-and-effect relationship exists. For example, if you look at a scatterplot of ice cream consumption and murder rates, those two variables have a positive linear relationship, too. Yet, no one would claim that ice cream consumption causes murders, or that murder rates affect ice cream consumption. If someone is trying to establish a cause-and-effect relationship by showing a chart or graph, dig deeper to find out how the study was designed and how the data were collected, and then evaluate the study appropriately using the criteria outlined in Chapter 17.  Other types of trends may exist besides the uphill or downhill linear trends. Variables can be related to each other through a curved relationship or through various exponential relationships; these are beyond the scope of this book. The good news, however, is that many relationships can be characterized as uphill or downhill linear relationships.  HEADS UP   Intervals  Displaying bivariate categorical data In the case where both variables are categorical  such as the gender of the respondent and whether the respondent does or does not support the president , the data are typically summarized in what statisticians call a two-way table  meaning a table that has rows representing the categories of the first variable and columns representing the categories of the second variable .  For example, in the aspirin versus colon polyps study, the two variables were categorical: whether or not the colon-cancer patient took aspirin  yes or no , and whether or not that person developed any   more polyps  yes or no . Note that Table 18-2 in the "Picturing the Relationship: Plots and Charts" section is a two-way table.  A more visually pleasing way to organize two-dimensional data is to use a bar graph or a series of pie charts. Figure 18-2 shows a bar graph that indicates the percentage of patients who developed polyps for the aspirin group compared to the non-aspirin  placebo  group. Figure 18-3 shows two pie charts, one for the aspirin group and one for the non-aspirin group. Each pie chart shows the percentage in that group that developed polyps.

But, in fact, that's not the case. Percentages are just a handy way to summarize the data from a categorical variable. In this case, the second variable is whether or not polyps developed  yes no  for each patient.  This is a categorical variable.  The percentages simply summarize all of the patients in each yes and no category.

List of Figures List of Tables Understanding the properties of the correlation coefficient List of Sidebars Here are some useful properties of correlations:  Figure 18-4: Scatterplots with various correlations.  The correlation is a unitless measure. This means that if you change the units of x or y, the correlation won't change.  For example, changing from Fahrenheit to Celsius won't affect the correlation between the frequency of chirps and the outside temperature.   The values of x and y can be switched in the data set, and the correlation won't change.  Quantifying a relationship between two categorical variables If both variables are categorical  such as whether or not the patient took aspirin and whether or not the   ISBN:0764554239  patient developed polyps , you really can't use the word "correlation" to describe the relationship, because correlation measures the strength of the linear relationship between numerical variables.  This mistake occurs in the media all the time, and it drives statisticians crazy!   Statistics For Dummies by Deborah Rumsey  John Wiley & Sons   2003  356 pages  This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life.  The word that is used to describe a relationship between two categorical variables is association. Two categorical variables  such as treatment group and outcome  are associated if the percentage of subjects who had a certain outcome in one group is significantly different than the percentage who had that same outcome in the other group. In the aspirin versus polyp example discussed in the first section of this chapter, researchers found that in the aspirin group, 17% of the colon cancer patients developed polyps, whereas in the placebo group, 27% developed polyps. Because these percentages   Table of Contents are quite different, the two variables are associated. Statistics for Dummies How different do the percentages have to be in order to signal a meaningful association between the Introduction two variables? The difference found by the sample has to be statistically significant. That way, the Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics same conclusion about a relationship can be made about the whole population, not just for a particular Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life data set. A hypothesis test of two proportions will work for this purpose  see Chapter 15 for details on Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong this test . I analyzed the data from the aspirin versus polyps study using that test and got a p-value of Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade less than 0.0001. That means these results are highly significant.

Explaining the Relationship: Association and Correlation versus Causation If two variables are found to be either associated or correlated, that doesn't necessarily mean that a cause-and-effect relationship exists between the two variables. Whether two variables are found to be causally associated depends on how the study was conducted. Only a well-designed experiment  see Chapter 17  or several different observational studies can show that an association or a correlation   crosses over into a cause-and-effect relationship. Table of Contents Statistics for Dummies Taking aspirin does seem to help Introduction Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life I feel confident about the conclusions drawn by the researchers in the aspirin versus polyps study discussed in the first section of this chapter; this study was a well-designed experiment, according to Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong the criteria established in Chapter 17. It included random assignment of patients to treatments, it had Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade large enough sample sizes to obtain accurate information, and it controlled for confounding variables. Part II - Number-Crunching Basics This means that the researchers truly are entitled to the headline of the press release, "Aspirin Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs Prevents Polyps in Colon Cancer Patients." Because of the design of this study, you can say that a Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More cause-and-effect relationship  association  exists between whether the colon cancer patients took Part III - Determining the Odds aspirin on a daily basis and whether polyps developed.

Statistics For Dummies by Deborah Rumsey  John Wiley & Sons   2003  356 pages  This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life.  REMEMBER Before examining any model that predicts one variable from another, find the  Never do a regression analysis unless you've already found a strong correlation  either positive or negative  between the two variables. I've seen cases where researchers go ahead and make predictions when a correlation was as low as 0.2! That doesn't make any sense. If the scatterplot of the data doesn't resemble a line to begin with, you shouldn't try to use a line to fit the data and to make predictions about the population.  Making predictions with correlated data   In the case of two numerical variables, if a strong correlation has been established, researchers often Table of Contents use the relationship between x and y to make predictions. Because x is correlated with y, a linear Statistics for Dummies relationship exists between them. This means that you can describe the relationship with a straight Introduction line. If you know the slope and the y-intercept of that line, then you can plug in a value for x and predict Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics the average value for y. In other words, you can predict y from x. Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong Because the correlation between cricket chirps and temperature is so high  r = 0.98 , you can find a Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade line that fits the data. This means that you want to find the one line that best fits the data  in terms of Part II - Number-Crunching Basics the average distance from all of the points in the data set to the line you generate .

Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence Fortunately, this is not the case  although eyeballing a line on the scatterplot does help you think about Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals what you'd expect the answer to be . The best-fitting line has a distinct slope and y-intercept that can Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples be calculated using formulas  and, I may add, these formulas aren't too hard to calculate . Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test Getting a formula for best-fitting line Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples The formula for the best-fitting line  or regression line  is y = mx + b, where m is the slope of the line Part VII - Statistical Studies—The Inside Scoop and b is the y-intercept. The slope of a line is the change in y over the change in x. For example, a Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls slope of 10 3 means that as x moves to the right 3 units, the y-value moves up 10 units, as you move Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? from one point on the line to the next. The y-intercept is that place on the y-axis where the line Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations , the line crosses the y-axis at the point - 6.

For example, in the equation  coordinates of this point are  0,- 6  — because you are crossing the y-axis, the x value of the y- Part VIII - The Part of Tens Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey intercept is always 0. To come up with the best-fitting line, you need to find values for m and b so that you have a real equation of a line  for example, y = 2x + 3; or y = - 10x - 45 . Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes Sources Index List of Figures List of Tables List of Sidebars  Tip To save a great deal of time calculating the best-fitting line, keep in mind that five well-known summary statistics are all you need to do all the necessary calculations.

Finding the slope of the best-fitting line   The formula for the slope, m, of the best-fitting line is m = r  , where r is the correlation between x and y, and s y and sx are the standard deviations of the y-values and the x-values, respectively  see Statistics For Dummies Chapter 5 for more on standard deviation . by Deborah Rumsey  John Wiley & Sons   2003  356 pages  This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life.

HEADS UP   TECHNICAL STUFF   The slope of the best-fitting line can be a negative number because the correlation can be a negative number. A negative slope indicates that the line is going downhill.  The formula for slope simply takes the correlation  a unitless measurement  and attaches units to it. Think of sy ÷ sx as the change in y over the change in x.

In general, x is the variable that is the predictor. List of Tables Statisticians call x the explanatory variable, because if you change x, that explains why and how y is List of Sidebars going to change. In this case, x is the number of cricket chirps in 15 seconds. The y variable is called the response variable; it responds to changes in x. In other words, y is being predicted by x. Here, y is the temperature. Comparing the working model to the data subset The big-five summary statistics from the subset of cricket data are shown in Table 18-3.  Notice that the formulas for the slope and y-intercept are in the form of x and y, so you have to decide which of your two variables you'll call x and which you'll call y. When doing correlations, the choice of which variable is x and which is y doesn't matter, as long as you're consistent for all the data; but when fitting lines and making predictions, the choice of x and y does make a difference. Take a look at the preceding formulas — switching the roles of x and y makes all of the formulas change.  Table 18-3: Cricket Data Big-Five Summary Statistics   Variable  Mean  Standard Deviation  Correlation   Chirps  x   Temp  y   x = 26.5  Statistics For Dummies by Deborah Rumsey  John Wiley & Sons   2003  356 pages  This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life.

Note that the preceding equation is close to, but not quite the same as, the working model: y = x + 40. Why isn't the preceding equation exactly the same as the working model? A couple of reasons come to mind. First, "working model" is fancy language for "not necessarily precise, but very practical." I'm guessing that over the years, the slope has been rounded to the nearest whole number  1  and the y-intercept has been rounded to the nearest ten  which makes it 40  just to make it easier for people to remember and more fun to write about.  This isn't good statistical practice and is an example of how statistics can drift over a period of years.  Second, the data I used are just a random subset of the original data set  for purposes of illustration  and will be a bit off, just by chance  see Chapter 9 for more on variation between samples . However, because the data are so highly correlated, the difference between one sample of data and another shouldn't be much. Intervals    The slope, m, for the best-fitting line for the subset of cricket chirp versus temperature data is r ×  sy ÷ Table of Contents sx  = 0.98 ×  6.8 ÷ 7.4  = 0.98 × 0.919 = 0.90. Now, to find the y-intercept, b, you take y -  m × x, or 67 Statistics for Dummies -   0.90  26.5  = 67 -  23.85 = 43.15. So the best-fitting line for predicting temperature from cricket Introduction chirps based on the data is: y = 0.9x +43.2, or Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade Part II - Number-Crunching Basics Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More Part III - Determining the Odds Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win Part IV - Wading through the Results Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary!

Any equation or function that is used to estimate or predict a relationship between Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions two variables is called a statistical model. Using this model, you can predict temperature using cricket Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples chirps. How do you do it? Choose a relevant value for x, plug it into the model, and find the expected Part VII - Statistical Studies—The Inside Scoop value for y. Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls For example, if you want to predict the temperature and you know that the cricket in your backyard Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? chirped 35 times in 15 seconds, you plug in 35 for x and find out what y is. Here goes: y = 0.9 35  + Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations 43.2 = 31.5 + 43.2 = 74.7. So, knowing that the cricket chirped 35 times in 15 seconds, you can predict Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control that the expected temperature is about 75 degrees Fahrenheit. Part VIII - The Part of Tens Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey HEADS Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes UP  Sources Index List of Figures List of Tables List of Sidebars  Just because you have a model doesn't mean you can plug in any value for x and do a good job of predicting y. For example, you can't plug in a number higher than 39 or lower than 18. Why not? Because, for this example, you don't have any data for x in those ranges  see Table 18-1 . Who's to say the line still works outside of the area where data were collected? Do you really think that as the temperature rises higher and higher into infinity the crickets will chirp faster and faster, without limit? At some point the poor crickets would die of heat exposure. Similarly, crickets won't survive in extremely cold weather, so you can't plug in extremely low values of x and expect the model to work.  REMEMBER Making predictions using x values that fall outside the range of your data is a no-no.  Statisticians call this extrapolation; watch for researchers who try to make claims beyond the range of their results.  TECHNICAL STUFF   Because the best-fitting line is a model describing the overall relationship between x and y, you're not really predicting y, you're predicting the expected  or average  value of y for any given x.  Making predictions with two associated categorical variables   ISBN:0764554239  After two categorical variables have been found to be associated, you can make predictions  estimates  about the percentage in each group regarding one of the variables, or you can estimate the difference between the percentages in the two groups. In both cases, you use confidence intervals to make those estimates  see Chapters 12 and 13 .

With the aspirin versus colon polyps example given in the first section of this chapter, among the group taking aspirin, the percentage of colon cancer patients who developed polyps was 17%, compared to 27% in the non-aspirin group  refer to Table 18-2 . The prediction you can make here is the following: If you're a colon cancer patient, you're less likely to develop a subsequent colon polyp if you take 325 mg of aspirin every day.    Table of Contents You can get more specific about this prediction. You can estimate the chance of a colon cancer patient Statistics for Dummies developing a polyp if he or she takes aspirin every day by finding a confidence interval. Because 17% Introduction of the sample of aspirin takers developed polyps, this means that the chance that any individual in that Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics population  that is, colon cancer patients  will develop subsequent polyps if they take aspirin every day Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life is 0.17, plus or minus the margin of error, or in this case, plus or minus 0.04.

Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence It turns out that tube-fill quality is affected by several factors, including those listed in the preceding Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence bullet list. Problems that toothpaste manufacturers want to avoid include underfilling  mainly due to air pockets  and overfilling  resulting in tubes that "give way", to use the tube-filling industry's term; Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals overfilling also results in giving some of the product away for free, which eats into profits . The Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples dimensions of the inside of the tube can also play a role in tube-fill quality. For example, undersized Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test tubes  even though they're filled with the proper amount of toothpaste  will bulge when sealed, and Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions oversized tubes will give the appearance of being underfilled. Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples Part VII - Statistical Studies—The Inside Scoop Understanding that quality = accuracy + consistency Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? Statistics are certainly involved in providing the data necessary to evaluate tube-filling equipment on Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations each of the criteria listed in the preceding section. However, the role of statistics in the manufacturing Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control process is most clearly emphasized by the manufacturer's criterion for quality in the tube-filling Part VIII - The Part of Tens process: consistency and accuracy. The words consistent and accurate scream statistics louder than Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey any other words in the manufacturing industry; they basically say it all. Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes Sources Accuracy and consistency are monitored statistically by using control charts. A control chart is a Index specialized time chart that displays the values of the data in the order in which they were collected List of Figures over time  see Chapter 4 for more information on time charts . Control charts use a line to denote List of Tables where the manufacturer's specified value — or target value — is  this deals with the accuracy issue  and boundaries to indicate how far above or below the target the values are expected to be  this deals List of Sidebars with the consistency part . The values being charted represent weights, volumes, or counts from individual products or, as is more often the case, they represent average weights, average volumes, or average counts from samples of products. The upper and lower boundaries of a control chart are called the upper control limit  UCL  and the lower control limit  LCL .  For example, suppose a candy maker is filling bags of sour candies, and the target value is 50 pieces per bag, with the LCL = 45 pieces, and the UCL = 55 pieces. Suppose 8 bags of candy are sampled, their candies are counted, and the results are found to be as follows: 51 pieces, 53 pieces, 49 pieces, 51 pieces, 54 pieces, 47 pieces, 52 pieces, and 45 pieces. Figure 19-1 shows a picture of the resulting control chart for this process. This process  at least for the time being  seems to be in control.

The data then need to be recorded on the control chart, and the Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win process needs to be monitored to determine whether the process is in control. This last step can be a tricky decision. On the one hand, you don't want to stop the process with a false alarm  which you Part IV - Wading through the Results could be doing if you stopped it the first time a value went outside of the control limits . On the other Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing hand, you don't want to let the process get out of control if it's beginning to produce inferior products. Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error Defining accuracy Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence What does it mean for a toothpaste tube-filling machine to be accurate? It means that the tubes weigh, Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals in the end, what they're supposed to weigh, on average. Notice that I said "on average." I think you Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples would agree that even the most sophisticated manufacturing process isn't perfect; some variation in Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test any process is normal due to random fluctuation. This means that you can't expect every single tube of Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions toothpaste to weigh exactly 6.4 ounces. However, if the tube weights start drifting lower and lower in terms of their actual weight, or if they suddenly contain a great deal of air and don't weigh what they Chapter 15 - Commonly Used Hypothesis Tests—Formulas and Examples should, consumers will notice, and the quality of the product will be compromised. Similarly, if the Part VII - Statistical Studies—The Inside Scoop average weight drifts upward, the manufacturer loses money because it's giving away extra product. Chapter 16 - Polls, Polls, and More Polls Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? Statistically speaking, product weights are accurate if they don't contain any bias or systematic error. Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations  Systematic error leads to values that are consistently high or consistently low, compared to the Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control expected value.  This falls right in line with the tube-filling industry's concept of accuracy. In this case Part VIII - The Part of Tens the expected value  target value  is the specification set by the manufacturer, such as 6.4 ounces. Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes Defining consistency Sources Index What does it mean for a toothpaste tube-filling machine to be consistent? It means that the tube List of Figures weights stay within the control limits most of the time. Notice I said "most of the time." Again, some List of Tables variation in any process is normal due to random fluctuation. However, if the tube weights start List of Sidebars bouncing all over the place, the quality of the product is compromised.  Intervals  Statistically speaking, weights are consistent if their standard deviation is small  see Chapter 4 . How small should the standard deviation be? It depends on the manufacturer's specifications and any limitations of the process. The operators of the tube-filling machines say that their machines are accurate to within 0.5%. This means that they expect most of the tubes labeled 6.4 ounces to weigh within 0.032 ounces of the target value  because 0.5% of 6.4 is 0.005 × 6.4 = 0.032 ounces . Suppose you assume that they want 95% of the tubes to be within that range. How many standard deviations are needed to cover about 95% of the values around the target?  According to the empirical rule  which you can use because you can assume the weights will have a mound-shaped distribution — see Chapter 8 , 95% of the weights will be within 2 standard deviations   ISBN:0764554239  of the target value. So, 0.032 = 2 times the standard deviation of the weights. That means each standard deviation would be worth at most 0.032 ÷ 2 = 0.016 ounces, according to the machine manufacturer's specifications. This is a conservative estimate; manufacturers' specifications may be wider than the actual control limits they set up during their quality control testing.  Statistics For Dummies by Deborah Rumsey  John Wiley & Sons   2003  356 pages  Expecting a normal distribution This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples Even though the tubes were set to be filled to 6.4 ounces, not all of the tubes are going to come out that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life. weighing exactly 6.4 ounces, of course. Some will be over, some will be under, but you expect most of   the tubes to weigh close to 6.4 ounces, with an equal percentage above and below 6.4 ounces  within Table of Contents the control limits , if the process is in control. Beyond having a general mound shape in the middle, the Statistics for Dummies weights of the toothpaste tubes should actually have a bell-shaped, or normal distribution.  See Introduction Chapter 8 for more about the normal distribution.  If the process is accurate, the mean of this Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics distribution will be the target value, indicated by µ. And you know that the manufacturer wants the Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life standard deviation to be no more than 0.016 ounces for consistency purposes. That means that µ = Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong 6.4 ounces and s  = 0.016 ounces. See Figure 19-2.

The standard deviation of a population is denoted by s , and the standard deviation of a sample is denoted by s.  See Chapter 5 for more on standard deviation.  In most statistical situations, the standard deviation of a population is unknown, and you use s to estimate it from a sample. But in the case of quality control, the standard deviation for the population of products manufactured is set by the manufacturer. The standard deviation for the population is expected to be this set value, if the process is in control.

Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes If the manufacturer is going to weigh individual tubes of toothpaste, the control limits will be set at the Sources target value  mean  plus or minus 2 standard deviations  for 95% confidence  or the target value Index  mean  plus or minus 3 standard deviations  for 99% confidence . The formulas for the control limits List of Figures for the individual weights are: µ ± 2µ or µ ± 3µ, respectively. List of Tables List of Sidebars The toothpaste manufacturers have set the mean at 6.4 and the standard deviation at 0.016. Suppose they want 95% confidence. This means that the control limits are 6.4 ± 2 0.016  = 6.4 ± 0.032. The LCL is 6.4 -  0.032 = 6.368 ounces, and the UCL is 6.4 + 0.032 = 6.432 ounces. If the manufacturers want 99% confidence, the control limits for the weights of individual tubes are 6.4 ± 3 0.016  = 6.4 ± 0.048. The LCL is 6.4 -  0.048 = 6.352 ounces, and the UCL is 6.4 + 0.048 = 6.448 ounces.  TECHNICAL STUFF   Intervals  However, most processes are monitored by taking samples and finding the average weight of each sample, rather than looking at individual products. This means that the control limits will include the target value  mean , plus or minus 2 standard errors  for 95% confidence  or the target value  mean  plus or minus 3 standard errors  for 99% confidence . A standard error is the standard deviation of the sample means, and is calculated by taking the standard deviation of the weights, divided by the square root of n, where n is the sample size.  See Chapters 9 and 10 for more on the standard error.  The   notation for standard error is    The formulas for the control limits for the sample means are given   or   by:   ISBN:0764554239   respectively  TECHNICAL STUFF   Statistics For Dummies by Deborah Rumsey  John Wiley & Sons   2003  356 pages  This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life.  The standard error will always be smaller than the standard deviation. That's because means are more consistent than individual values, because they're based on more data and, therefore, won't vary as much from one sample to the next. The larger the sample size is, the smaller the standard error is going to be  because with n in the denominator, as n increases, the value of the standard deviation divided by the square root of n decreases . See Chapter 10 for details.  Tip If the process is monitored by weighing each tube as it comes through, that's the same as  monitoring samples of size n = 1. So for n = 1, the formulas for standard deviation and standard error are the same  which they should be .    Table of Contents Statistics for Dummies Introduction Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong Suppose the size of each sample of toothpaste tubes is 10.

Monitoring the process   ISBN:0764554239  After the control limits have been set, the next step is to monitor the process. In most cases, this involves taking samples of the products at various times, finding their average weights, and marking these averages on a control chart. When it looks like the process is going off track, either in terms of accuracy or consistency, the manufacturing process is stopped, the problem is identified, and repairs or adjustments are made.

In actual production, when the tube-filler has to be stopped, the entire production line comes to a standstill. Valuable time and production capacity are lost while maintenance and other personnel locate and correct the problem. This puts added pressure on the statistical process to always provide accurate and reliable information. Before deciding to stop the process, the workers responsible for the quality of the product want to be absolutely sure that a problem really does exist; on the other hand, if a problem has developed on the production line, they don't want to let it go on too long before making the necessary corrections. A delicate balance must be found.  If a process is in control, you should see about 68% of the sample means falling within 1 standard error, 95% of the sample means falling within 2 standard errors and 99% of the sample means falling within 3 standard errors of the target value, according to the empirical rule  see Chapter 8 . The overall   sample mean should be the target value, and you should see about as many values below the target Table of Contents as above the target, with no particular patterns to those values.

Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence  If the control limits are set at plus or minus 2 standard errors, then 95% of the means should lie within these control limits for the process to be in control. But this means that you should expect 5% of the results to lie outside these limits just by chance, and that Intervals should be okay! Here's the tricky part. You don't want to stop the process the first time a mean falls outside of the control limits; that's expected to happen 5% of the time, just by random chance  see Chapter 10 for more on this . So, in order to avoid too many false alarms, you need more than one mean to fall outside the limits to make the decision to stop the process.

Welcome to the wonderfully Chapter 17 - Experiments—Medical Breakthroughs or Misleading Results? vague world of statistics! Here are four examples of rules that are often used to determine whether a Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations process is out of control and should be stopped: Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control Part VIII - The Part of Tens Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes Sources Index List of Figures List of Tables List of Sidebars  Five sample means in a row are all either above the target or below the target  as in Figure 19- 5a . Suspected cause: systematic overfilling or underfilling due to problems in the process.  HEADS UP   Figure 19-5: Toothpaste filling processes that are out of control.   Six sample means in a row are either steadily increasing or steadily decreasing  as in Figure 19- 5b . Suspected cause: The products coming off the line are slowly drifting farther and farther away from the intended average value, probably due to problems with one or more machines.  Fourteen sample means in a row alternating above and below the target value  as in Figure 19- 5c . Suspected cause: two different operators, machines, or suppliers are feeding into one system but are not in agreement.  Statistics For Dummies by Deborah Rumsey  John Wiley & Sons   2003  356 pages  This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life.  ISBN:0764554239  TECHNICAL STUFF   Fifteen sample means in a row are only within 1 standard error of the target  as in Figure 19-5d . Suspected cause: the process is more consistent than the specifications call for.  If this overly consistent process costs time or money, it should be loosened up. If the overly consistent process does not add time or money, finding out why the process changed — and replicating this change in the future — may be worthwhile.   These rules are based on probability; you stop the process when the chance of the process still being in control is very small given the data you're getting. Note that the chance of any one sample mean falling above or below the target is 50%, or 0.5. So, for the first rule listed in the preceding bullet list, the probability of getting 5 sample means in a row that are all on the same side of the target is  0.5  ×  0.5  ×  0.5  ×  0.5  ×  0.5  = 0.03 = 3%. This is under the typical cutoff probability of 5%  see Chapter 14 . You conclude that the process is not in control. The chance that the process is still in control, given the data, is too small.

REMEMBER Note that sometimes, the target population needs a bit of refinement for clarity. For example, what age groups do you want to include in your target population? For the reality TV example, you probably don't want to include children under a certain age, say 12. So your target population is actually all residents of Great Britain aged 12 and over.  Chapter 20: Ten Criteria for a Good Survey Surveys are all around you: I guarantee that at some point in your life, you'll be asked to complete a survey. This means that you're also inundated with the results of those surveys, and before you consume the information, you need to evaluate whether a survey was properly designed and implemented — in other words, don't assume the survey is okay until you check it out  see Chapter 16 for the lowdown on surveys .

You usually don't have the time or money to do that. The best you can do is select a sample  a subset of individuals from the population  and get the information from them. Because this sample of individuals is your only link to the entire target population, you want that sample to be really good.

This Introduction sounds easy enough, right? All you need to do is get a list of all the individuals in the target population Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics  this is called a sampling frame  and select a sample of people from it. How difficult can that be? Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life Pretty difficult. Suppose your target population is all registered voters in the United States who are Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong likely to vote in the next presidential election. Getting a list of these individuals isn't easy. You can look Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade at voter registration lists, but you don't know which people are likely to vote in the next election.

Randomly means that every member of the target population has an equal chance of being included in the sample. In other words, the process you use for selecting your sample can't be biased.

Internet surveys are the biggest culprit here. A company can say that 50,000 people logged on to its Web site to answer a survey, which means the survey results have a lot of information. But that information is biased, because it doesn't represent the opinions of anyone except those who chose to participate in the survey; that is, they had access to the Internet, went to the Web site, and chose to complete the survey. In this case, less would have been more: The company should have sampled fewer people but done so randomly.   which is 0.032 or 3.2%. This percentage is called the margin of error.

Good Follow-Up Minimizes Non-Response After the sample size has been chosen and the sample of individuals has been randomly selected from the target population, you have to get the information you need from the people in the sample. If you've ever thrown away a survey or refused to answer a few questions over the phone, you know that getting people to participate in a survey isn't easy. If a researcher wants to minimizes bias, the best way to handle non-responses is to "hound" the people in the sample: Follow up one, two, or even   three times, offering dollar bills, coupons, self-addressed stamped return envelopes, chances to win Table of Contents prizes, and so on. Note that offering more than a small token of incentive and appreciation for Statistics for Dummies participating would create bias, as well, because then people who really need the money are more Introduction likely to respond than those who don't. Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life Consider what motivates you to fill out a survey. If the incentive provided by the researcher doesn't get Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong you, maybe the subject matter peaks your interest. Unfortunately, this is where bias comes in. If only those folks who feel very strongly respond to a survey, only their opinions will count; because the other Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade people who don't really care about the issue don't respond, each "I don't care" vote doesn't count. And Part II - Number-Crunching Basics when people do care but don't take the time to complete the survey, those votes doesn't count, either. Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More For example, suppose 1,000 people are given a survey on whether to change the park rules to allow Part III - Determining the Odds dogs. Who will respond? Most likely, the respondents will be those who feel strongly for allowing dogs Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability and who feel strongly against dogs in the park. Suppose 100 of each are the only respondents and the Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win other 800 surveys aren't returned. This means that 800 opinions aren't counted. If none of those 800 Part IV - Wading through the Results people really cares about the issue either way and if you could count their opinions, the results would Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing be 800 ÷ 1000 or 80% saying "no opinion", with 10%  100 ÷ 1,000  saying they support the issue and Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! 10%  100 ÷ 1,000  against the issue. Without those votes of the 800 nonrespondents, however, Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error researchers can report, "Of the people who responded, 50% were for the issue, and 50% were against Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence it." This gives the impression of a very different  and biased!  result. Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence  HEADS UP   Intervals The response rate of a survey is a percentage found by taking the number of respondents divided by the total sample size and multiplying by 100%. A good response rate is anything over 70%. However, most response rates fall well short of that, unless the survey is done by a very reputable organization, such as The Gallup Organization. Look for the response rate when examining survey results. If the response rate is too low  much less than 70%  the results may be biased and should be ignored.

You'll be doing your part to rid the world of bias!            ISBN:0764554239  The Type of Survey Used Is Appropriate Surveys come in many types: mail surveys, telephone surveys, Internet surveys, house-to-house interviews, and man-on-the-street surveys  in which someone comes up to you with a clipboard and asks, "Do you have a few minutes to participate in a survey?" . One very important yet sometimes overlooked criterion of a good survey is whether the type of survey being used is appropriate for the situation.

The Questions Are Well Worded The way that a question is worded in a survey can affect the results. For example, while President Bill Clinton was in office and the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke, a CNN Gallup Poll conducted August 21–23, 1998, asked respondents to judge Clinton's favorability, and about 60% gave him a positive result.  The sample size for this survey was 1,317, and the margin of error was reported to be plus or minus 3 percentage points.  When CNN Gallup reworded the question to ask respondents to judge   Clinton's favorability "as a person", the results changed: Only about 40% gave him a positive rating. Table of Contents Statistics for Dummies The next night, CNN Gallup conducted another survey on the same topic. Here are some of the Introduction questions and responses: Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade Part II - Number-Crunching Basics Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More Part III - Determining the Odds Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win Part IV - Wading through the Results These questions are all getting at the same issue: how people felt about President Clinton during the Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing time of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. And while these questions are similar, all are worded slightly Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! differently, and you can see how different the results are. So question wording does matter. Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error Probably the biggest problem with question wording though is the use of leading questions. In other Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence words, questions that are worded in such a way that you know how the researcher wants you to Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence answer. This leads to biased results that give too much weight to a certain answer because of the Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals wording of the question, not because people actually have that opinion. Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples Many surveys contain leading questions  either unintentionally or by design , to get you to say what the Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test pollster wants you to say.

The Survey Is Properly Timed The timing of a survey is everything. Current events shape people's opinions, and while some pollsters try to determine how people really feel, others take advantage of these situations, especially the negative ones. For example, when shootings have occurred in schools, the issue of gun control has often been raised in surveys. Of course, during the time immediately following such a tragedy, more people are in favor of gun control than before; in other words, the results spike upward. After a period   of time, however, opinions go back to what they were before; meanwhile the pollsters project the Table of Contents results of the survey as if the public feels that way all the time. Statistics for Dummies Introduction Timing of any survey, regardless of the subject matter, can still cause bias. For example, suppose your Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics target population is people who work full time. If you conduct a telephone survey by calling their homes Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., you're going to have a lot of bias in your results, because Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong those are the hours that the majority of fulltime workers are at work!

They have to deal with hang ups, take-us- off-your-list responses, and answering machines. And then, after they do get a live respondent at the other end of the phone or face to face, their job becomes even harder. That's when they have to collect data in an accurate and unbiased way.

ISBN:0764554239  Here are some problems that can come up during the survey process:  The respondent doesn't understand the question and needs more information. How much do you tell that person, while still remaining neutral?  The person carrying out the survey has to make a judgment call. For example, suppose the question asks how many people are living in the house, and the respondent asks, "Do I count my cousin Bob who is just staying with us while he looks for a job?"

Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence  Respondents may give misinformation. For example, some people hate surveys so much that they go beyond refusing to do them and actually complete them, but give all misleading answers. For example, when asked how old she is, a woman may say 101 years old.  Tip You can also avoid problems by running a pilot study  a practice run with a only a few respondents  that's recorded, so that personnel can practice and be evaluated on how accurate and consistent they are in collecting their data. In this way, researchers can anticipate problems before the survey process starts and put policies in place for how they are to be handled.  Chapter 12 - Calculating Accurate Confidence Intervals Chapter 13 - Commonly Used Confidence Intervals—Formulas and Examples Part IV - Putting a Claim to the  Hypothesis  Test Chapter 14 - Claims, Tests, and Conclusions Surveys should avoid unclear, ambiguous, or leading questions.

The Survey Answers the Original Question Suppose a researcher starts out with a statement like, "I want to find out about shoppers' buying habits." That sounds good, right? But then you look at the survey, and the questions are all about how people feel about shopping  "What do you like best least about shopping?" or "On a scale of 1–10, how much do you enjoy shopping?" . The questions don't ask about buying behavior. While attitudes toward shopping do influence shoppers' buying habits, the real measure of buying habits is how   shoppers behave: what they're buying, how much they spend, where they're shopping, with whom they Table of Contents shop, when they shop, how often they shop, and so on. Sometimes, researchers don't realize that they Statistics for Dummies have missed the boat until after their survey results are in.

Chapter 21: Ten Common Statistical Mistakes This book is about not only understanding the statistics that you come across in the media and in your workplace, but digging deeper to examine whether those statistics are correct, reasonable, and fair. You have to be vigilant — and a bit skeptical — to deal with today's information explosion, because many of the statistics you come across are wrong or misleading, either by error or by design. If you don't critique the information you're consuming, who will? In this chapter, I outline some common   statistical mistakes made by researchers and by the media, and I share ways to recognize and avoid Table of Contents those mistakes. Statistics for Dummies Introduction Misleading Graphs Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life Many graphs and charts contain misinformation, mislabeled information, or misleading information, or Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong they simply lack important information that the reader needs to make critical decisions about what is Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade being presented. Figure 21-1 shows examples of four types of data displays: pie charts, bar graphs, Part II - Number-Crunching Basics time charts, and histograms.  Note that a histogram is basically a bar graph for numerical data.  For Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs each type, I outline some of the most common ways that you can be misled.

Figure 21-1: Four types of data displays.  Here's how to sink your teeth into a pie chart and test it for quality:  Check to be sure the percentages add up to 100%, or close to it  any round-off error should be small .  Beware of slices of the pie called "other" that are larger than the rest of the slices. This means the pie chart is too vague.   Watch for distortions that come with the three-dimensional-looking pie charts, in which the slice closest to you looks larger than it really is because of the angle at which it's presented.  ISBN:0764554239  Look for a reported total number of individuals who make up the pie chart, so you can determine how big the pie was before it was divided up into the slices that you're looking at. If the size of the data set  the number of respondents  is too small, the information isn't reliable.

Consider the units being represented by the height of the bars and what the results mean in terms of those units. For example, total number of crimes verses the crime rate, which is measured by total number of crimes per capita  that is, per person .  Evaluate the appropriateness of the scale, or amount of space between units expressing the number in each group of the bar graph. For example, number of customer complaints for men versus women could be expressed by units of 1, 5, 10, or 100. Small scales  for example, going from 1 to 500 by 10s  make differences look bigger; large scales  for example, going from 1 to 500 by 100s  make differences look smaller.  Bar graphs   A bar graph is similar to a pie chart, except that instead of being in the shape of a circle that's divided Table of Contents up into slices, a bar graph represents each group as a bar, and the height of the bar represents the Statistics for Dummies number or percentage of individuals in that group.

Chapter 18 - Looking for Links—Correlations and Associations Chapter 19 - Statistics and Toothpaste—Quality Control Part VIII - The Part of Tens Chapter 20 - Ten Criteria for a Good Survey Chapter 21 - Ten Common Statistical Mistakes Sources Index Histograms List of Figures List of Tables A histogram is a graph that breaks the sample into groups according to a numerical variable  such as List of Sidebars age, height, weight, or income  and shows either the number of individuals  frequency  or the percentage of individuals  relative frequency  that fall into each group. For example, perhaps 20% of a sample was 20 years old or less; 30% was between 20 and 40 years old; 45% was between 40 and 60 years old; and 5% was over 60 years old  age being the numerical variable here .  Watch for situations in which the time axis isn't marked with equally spaced jumps. This often happens when data are missing. For example, the time axis may have equal spacing between 1971, 1972, 1975, 1976, 1978, when it should actually show empty spaces for the years in which no data are available.  Beware of people trying to explain why a trend is occurring without additional statistics to back themselves up. A time chart generally shows what is happening. Why it's happening is another story!  Watch the scale on the vertical  quantity  axis as well as the horizontal  timeline  axis; results can be made to look more or less dramatic than they actually are by simply changing the scale.  Take into account the units being portrayed by the chart and be sure they are equitable for comparison over time; for example, are dollar amounts being adjusted for inflation?  Intervals  Some items to watch for regarding histograms include the following:  Watch the scale used for the vertical  frequency relative frequency  axis, looking especially for results that are exaggerated or played down through the use of inappropriate scales.  Check out the units on the vertical axis, whether they're reporting frequencies or relative frequencies; take that information into account when examining the information.   Look at the scale used for the groupings of the numerical variable on the horizontal axis. If the groups are based on small intervals  for example, 0–2, 2–4, and so on , the data may look overly volatile. If the groups are based on large intervals  for example, 0–100, 100–200, and so on , the data may give a smoother appearance than is realistic.

For example, if I use a ruler to measure plants and that ruler is 1 2-inch short, all of my results are biased; they're systematically lower than their true values.

ISBN:0764554239  Participants are influenced by the data collection process. For example, a survey question that asks, "Have you ever disagreed with the government?" will overestimate the percentage of people who are unhappy with the government.  Measurement instruments are systematically off. For example, a police officer's radar gun says you were going 76 miles per hour but you know you were only going 72 miles per hour. Or a scale that always adds 5 pounds to your weight.  Here are some of the most common sources of biased data:    Table of Contents Statistics for Dummies Introduction Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade Part II - Number-Crunching Basics Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More Part III - Determining the Odds Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win Part IV - Wading through the Results Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary!

For example, examining study habits by visiting only the campus library puts more emphasis on those who study the most.  See more on this in the "Non-Random Samples" section later in this chapter.   Researchers aren't objective. For example, suppose one group of patients is given a sugar pill, and the other group is given a real drug. The researchers can't know who got what treatment, because if they do, they may inadvertently project results onto the patients  such as saying, "You're feeling better, aren't you?"  or pay more attention to those on the drug.  To spot biased data, examine how the data were collected. Ask questions about the selection of the participants, how the study was conducted, what questions were used, what treatments  medications, procedures, therapy, and so on  were given  if any , and who knew about them, what measurement instruments were used and how they were Intervals calibrated, and so on. Look for systematic errors or favoritism, and if you see too much of it, ignore the results.

No Margin of Error The word "error" has a somewhat negative connotation, as if an error is something that is always avoidable. In statistics, that's not always the case. For example, a certain amount of what statisticians call sampling error will always occur whenever someone tries to estimate a population value using anything other than the entire population. Just the act of selecting a sample from the population means you leave out certain individuals, and that means you're not going to get the precise, exact   population value. No worries, though. Remember that statistics means never having to say you're Table of Contents certain — you have to only get close. And if the sample is large and is randomly selected, the Statistics for Dummies sampling error will be small. Introduction Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics To evaluate a statistical result, you need a measure of its accuracy — typically through the margin of Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life error. The margin of error tells you how much the researcher expects his or her results to vary from Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong sample to sample.  For more information on margin of error, see Chapter 10.  When a researcher or the media fail to report the margin of error, you're left to wonder about the accuracy of the results, or Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade worse, you just assume that everything is fine, when in many cases, it's not. Survey results shown on Part II - Number-Crunching Basics TV used to only rarely include a margin of error, but now, you do often see that information reported. Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs Still, many newspapers, magazines, and Internet surveys fail to report a margin of error, or they report Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More a margin of error that is meaningless because the data are biased  see Chapter 10 .

This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, Plus, you don't need a very big sample to be amazingly accurate, if the sample being studied is techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples representative of the population. For example, a well-designed and well-conducted survey of 2,500 that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life. people has a margin of error of roughly plus or minus only 2%  see Chapter 10 . For an experiment   with a treatment group and a control group, statisticians would like to see at least 30 people in each Table of Contents group in order to have accurate data. Statistics for Dummies Introduction How can you ensure that the sample represents the population? The best way is to randomly select Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics the individuals from the population. A random sample is a subset of the population selected in such a Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life way that each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected  like drawing names Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong out of a hat . No systematic favoritism or exclusion is involved in a random sample. Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade Many surveys and studies aren't based on random samples of individuals. For example, medical Part II - Number-Crunching Basics studies are often performed with volunteers that, obviously, volunteer — they're not randomly selected. Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs It wouldn't be practical to phone people and say, "You were chosen at random to participate in our Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More sleeping study. You'll need to come down to our lab and stay there for four nights." In this situation, the Part III - Determining the Odds best you can do is study the volunteers and see how well they represent the population, and then Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability report those results. You can also ask for certain types of volunteers. Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win Part IV - Wading through the Results Polls and surveys also need to be based on randomly selected individuals, and doing so is much Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing easier than with medical studies. However, many surveys aren't based on random samples. For Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! example, TV polls asking viewers to "call us with your opinion" aren't based on random samples. Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error These surveys don't give the entire population an equal chance to be chosen  in fact, in these examples, the people choose themselves . Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence  Intervals  Before making any decisions about statistical results from a survey or a study, look to see how the sample of individuals was selected.

Missing Sample Sizes The quantity of information is always important in terms of assessing how accurate a statistic will be. The more information that goes into a statistic, the more accurate that statistic will be — as long as that information isn't biased, of course  see the "Biased Data" section earlier in this chapter . The consumer of the statistical information needs to assess the accuracy of the information, and for that, you need to look at how the information was collected  see Chapter 16 regarding surveys and Chapter   17 regarding experiments , and how much information was collected  that is, you have to know the Table of Contents sample size . Statistics for Dummies Introduction Many charts and graphs that appear in the media don't include a sample size. You also find that many Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics headlines are "not exactly" what they seem to be, when the details of an article reveal either a small Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life sample size  reducing reliability in the results  or in some cases, no information at all about the sample Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong size.  For example, you've probably seen the chewing gum ad that says, "Four out of five dentists surveyed recommend [this gum] for their patients who chew gum."

Instead, correlation applies only to two numerical variables, such as height and weight. So, if you hear someone say, "It appears that the voting pattern is correlated with gender", you know that's incorrect. Voting pattern and gender may be associated, but they can't be correlated, according to the statistical definition of correlation.  Misinterpreted Correlations Statistics For Dummies by Deborah Rumsey  The statistical definition of correlation is the strength and direction of the linear relationship between John Wiley & Sons   2003  356 pages  two numerical variables. In other words, the amount by which one numerical variable  for example, This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, weight  is expected to increase or decrease if another numerical variable  for example, height  is techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples allowed to increase decrease. Correlation is one of the most misunderstood and misused statistical that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life. terms used by researchers, the media, and the general public. Three important points about   correlation are as follows: Table of Contents Statistics for Dummies Introduction Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade Part II - Number-Crunching Basics Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More Part III - Determining the Odds Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win Part IV - Wading through the Results Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence  A correlation measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two numerical variables. In other words, if you collect data on two numerical variables  such as height and weight  and plot all of the points on a graph, when a correlation exists, you should be able to draw a straight line through those points  uphill or downhill , and the line should fit pretty well. If a line doesn't fit, the variables aren't correlated. However, that doesn't necessarily mean the variables aren't related. They may have some other type of relationship; they just don't have a linear relationship. For example, bacteria multiply at an exponential rate over time  their numbers explode, doubling faster and faster , not at a linear rate  which would be a steady increase over time .  Correlation doesn't automatically mean cause and effect. For example, suppose someone reports that more people who drink diet soda have brain tumors than people who don't. If you're a diet soda drinker, don't panic just yet. This may be a freak of nature, and someone happened to notice it.

For example, suppose a researcher tries to This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, say that eating seaweed helps you live longer, and when you examine the study further, you find out techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples that it was based on a sample of people who regularly eat seaweed in their diets and are over the age that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life. of 100. Suppose you then read interviews of these people and discover some of their other secrets to   long life  besides eating seaweed : They ate very healthy foods, slept an average of 8 hours a day, Table of Contents drank a lot of water, and exercised every day. So did the seaweed cause them to live longer? Maybe, Statistics for Dummies but you can't tell, because the confounding variables  exercise, water consumption, diet, and sleeping Introduction patterns  could also have caused longer life. Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics Chapter 1 - The Statistics of Everyday Life A common error in research studies is to fail to control for confounding variables, leaving the results Chapter 2 - Statistics Gone Wrong open to scrutiny  and you want to be among those doing the scrutinizing ! The best way to control for confounding variables is to do a well-designed experiment, which involves setting up two groups that Chapter 3 - Tools of the Trade are alike in as many ways as possible, except that one group  called the treatment group  takes a Part II - Number-Crunching Basics treatment, and the other takes a placebo  a fake treatment; this group is called the control group . You Chapter 4 - Getting the Picture—Charts and Graphs then compare the results from the two groups, attributing any significant differences to the treatment Chapter 5 - Means, Medians, and More  and to nothing else, in an ideal world . Part III - Determining the Odds Chapter 6 - What Are the Chances?—Understanding Probability The seaweed study wasn't a designed experiment; it was an observational study. In observational Chapter 7 - Gambling to Win studies, no control for any variables exists; people are merely observed, and information is recorded. Part IV - Wading through the Results Chapter 8 - Measures of Relative Standing Chapter 9 - Caution—Sample Results Vary! Chapter 10 - Leaving Room for a Margin of Error Part V - Guesstimating with Confidence Chapter 11 - The Business of Estimation—Interpreting and Evaluating Confidence  Whenever you're looking at the results of a study that's claiming to show a cause-and- effect relationship or significant differences between groups, check to see whether the study was a designed experiment and whether confounding variables were controlled for. If doing an experiment is unethical  for example, showing smoking causes lung cancer by forcing half of the subjects in the experiment to smoke 10 packs a day for 20 years, while Intervals the other half of the subjects smoke nothing  you must rely on mounting evidence from many observational studies that cover many different situations, all leading to the same result.  HEADS UP   REMEMBER Observational studies are great for surveys and polls, but not for showing cause-and-  effect relationships, because they don't control for confounding variables. A well- designed experiment provides much stronger evidence.

In fact, errors appear all the time  by error or by design , so stay on the lookout for them. Here are some tips for spotting botched numbers:  Statistics For Dummies by Deborah Rumsey  John Wiley & Sons   2003  356 pages  This reference offers explanations of statistical ideas, techniques, formulas, and calculations, and includes examples that show how these concepts apply to your everyday life.  ISBN:0764554239  Make sure everything adds up to what it's reported to. With pie charts, be sure all the percentages add up to 100%.  Double check even the most basic of calculations. For example, a chart says 83% of Americans are in favor of an issue, but the report says 7 out of every 8 Americans are in favor of the issue. Are these the same?  No, 7 divided by 8 is 87.5%; 5 out of 6 is about 83%.   Look for the response rate of a survey; don't just be happy with the number of participants.  The response rate is the number of people who responded divided by the total number of people surveyed times 100%.  If the response rate is much lower than 70%, the results could be biased, because you don't know what the non-respondents would have said.

You, as a consumer of information  also known as a certified skeptic , must be the one to take action. The best policy is to ask questions.  Question the type of statistic used, to determine whether it's appropriate. For example, the number of crimes went up, but so did the population size. The researchers should have reported the crime rate  number of crimes per capita , instead.

Selectively Reporting Results Another bad scenario is when a researcher reports his one statistically significant result  a result that was very unlikely to have occurred simply by chance , but leaves out the part where he actually conducted hundreds of other, unreported tests, all of which were not significant. If you had known about all of the other tests, you may have wondered whether this one that was significant was meaningful, or if, indeed, it was simply due to chance because of the large number of tests performed.   This is what statisticians like to call data snooping or data fishing. Table of Contents Statistics for Dummies How do you protect yourself against misleading results due to data fishing? Find out more details Introduction about the study: how many tests were done, how many results weren't significant, and what was found Part I - Vital Statistics about Statistics to be significant.
